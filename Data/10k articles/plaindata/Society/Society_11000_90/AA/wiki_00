The strike is being conducted at least in part in response to the April 2018 prison riot at Lee Correctional Institution, which killed seven inmates and was the deadliest prison riot in the U.S. in the past 25 years.\n\nThe start and end dates of the strike have symbolic meaning as they were planned to coincide with the 47th anniversary of the death of George Jackson, who was shot in an escape attempt on August 21, 1971, and the Attica Prison riot, which occurred on September 9, 1971.\n\nThe prison strike was called for and is being organized primarily by Jailhouse Lawyers Speak and Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, which is a prisoner-lead section of Industrial Workers of the World. Millions for Prisoners, and The People's Consortium are some of the other groups involved.\n\nThe following are the demands of the Prison Strike according to the official page:\n\n\nIn late June Ronald Brooks, is transferred from Angola Prison to the David Wade Correctional Center after he makes a pro-strike video.\n\nIn late July Siddique Hassan is reported for five violations of prison rules, including “Rioting, or encouraging others to riot”, most likely as a way to prevent him from speaking to the media during the strike, as he had in the 2016 Prison Strike.\n\nOn August 9th, the first confirmed strike activity begins at the GEO Group prison in response to administration cutting family visits, harassing families, strip searching elder family members, and STIU targeting, harassing, and abusing inmates. 3 housing units joined in the work stoppage. In response, New Mexico prison officials put all state prisons on lockdown on August 20th as a preemptive measure.\n\nOn August 19th, prisoners in the Burnside jail in Nova Scotia, Canada hold a protest and release a statement in support of the strike and with their own list of demands.\n\nWhile most news on strike activity didn't reach the outside on the first day, the strike received widespread attention from numerous news outlets including USA Today, Newsweek and National Public Radio.\n\nAt least 200 detained immigrants at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, WA engaged in a hunger strike and/or work stoppage, releasing a statement stating that they are,\n\"acting with solidarity for all those people who are being detained wrongfully, and stand together to help support all those women who have been separated from their children, and to stop all the family separations happening today for a lot of us are also being separated and we have U.S. citizen children.”\n\nHeriberto Sharky Garcia, incarcerated in Repressa, California declares a hunger strike.\n\nThere were also unconfirmed reports of 11 out of 143 prisons in Florida being affected, although the Florida Department of Corrections denied that they had any stoppages, protests, or lockdowns related to the strike.\n\n"}

{"id": "4392015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4392015", "title": "Caboclo", "text": "Caboclo\n\nA caboclo (, also pronounced \"caboco\"; from Brazilian Portuguese, perhaps ultimately from Tupi \"kaa'boc\", means a \"person having copper-coloured skin\") (English: cabloke) is a person of mixed Indigenous Brazilian and European ancestry (the first, most common use), or a culturally assimilated person of full Amerindian descent. In Brazil, a \"caboclo\" generally refers to this specific type of \"mestiço\". A person of mixed Indigenous Brazilian and sub-Saharan black ancestry is known as a \"cafuzo\".\n\nIn the 1872 and 1890 censuses, 3.90% and 9.04% of the population self-identified as caboclos, respectively. Since then, caboclos are counted as pardos, along with mulattoes (mixed Black-White) and cafuzos (mixed Amerindian-Black).\n\nA survey performed in Rio de Janeiro showed that 14% of Whites and 6% of Pardos reported a mixed Amerindian and White ancestry.\n\nAccording to the Mexican researcher Lizcano, based on a non genetic based estimation, caboclos (\"mestizos\") would be 12% of Brazilian population.\n\nThe term \"caboclo\" (which in the Amazon Basin and in Candomblé is usually pronounced without the \"l\", as \"caboco\") is said to come from the Tupi word \"kari'boka\", meaning \"deriving from the white\". Its primary meaning is \"mestizo\", \"a person of part Amerindian and part European descent.\" But it may also be used to refer to any Indigenous Brazilian who is assimilated. The term Indian should not be confused with people originating from India in South Asia.\n\nThe king of Portugal, D. Joseph I, encouraged marriages between European colonists and Indians in the 18th century; this enabled the European men to settle into families, and resulted in the birth of the first \"caboclo\" children. Similarly, in the 19th century during the time of rubber soldiers, the government recruited young, primarily white and \"mestiço\" Brazilian men from Northeastern Brazil and transported them into the Amazonian interior to harvest rubber. The men were never granted permission to leave, and married local native women, fathering more generations of mestiços.\n\nThe \"caboclo\" populations in the Amazon region of Brazil are noted as voracious eaters of the \"açaí\" palm fruit, which is basic to the traditional diet of the natives. In one study, \"açaí\" palm was described as the most important plant species because the fruit makes up such a major component of diet (up to 42% of the total food intake by weight) and is economically valuable in the region (Murrieta et al., 1999).\n\nThe term \"caboco\" is also used as an alternate term for the \"Orishas\" of the Candomblé religion. The caboclo is also an Orisha.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Until the French Revolution it was an enclave of Languedoc in the Comtat Venaissin. Protected as a historic monument since 1973, it has given its name to a winery.\n\nVarious elements of the château de l'Hers attest to the occupation of this strategically important location as a control point for river traffic, since late Antiquity at the latest. Several tombs with saddleback roofs form a small 6th-7th necropolis not far from the first known chapel of the château, dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian. An excavation of this ruined church found lithic industries, and sherds from antiquity and the Iron Age, fragments of Tegula tiles and a cipolin cladding probably dating to Antiquity were re-used in the masonry. A large number of weapons, coins and medals were found in the area. The tollgate on the Rhône was put in place in 79 AD under Vespasian, according to V. Millet (1864).\n\nThere must have been a Roman \"castrum\", probably destroyed in the great invasions. This appeared under the name of \"castellum de Leri\" in a 913 charter. It was signed by Louis the Blind and ceded it to Foulques, Bishop of Avignon.\n\nIn 1077, his successor Rostaing granted the fief to Pierre d'Albaron, who built a keep there. The first mention of a \"Castro Novo\" (new fortified village), which led to the name Châteauneuf-du-Pape, does not appear until 1094 It became the château de l'Hers after it was expanded in the 12th century and then was renovated for the first time during the 13th century. Certain historians have said that the Knights Templar used it at the end of the 12th century. This legend was disproven by the historians in the 20th century.\n\nL'Hers (or Lair, or Lers), become an enclave of Languedoc on the right bank of the Rhône, the château and its village were in ruins during the 12th century. Historical texts say that the parish had two places of worship, the parish church named Sainte-Marie and the château's chapel dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian\n\nJacques d'Euze, formerly bishop of Avignon, was elected pope in 1316 and took the name John XXII. Châteauneuf fell directly under his authority. Barely pope for three months, he had construction undertaken at l'Hers. The accounts of the Apostolic Camera say that he allocated 3,000 florins to the restoration of the old 12-century château.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the old château was a watch post and toll station on the Rhône which passed to different families allied to the Albaron family.\n\nThe Albaron kept their fief until 1360, when it was transferred to the family as a dowry. Around 1400, it came back to the Albaron de Laudin des Baux family, who kept it until the 1420s. The last heiress of this family brought it as a dowry to an Allemand. That family then took the name Allemand de Laudun Albaron. During the 16th century its toll rights fell in turn to the Arpajon Cardaillac, Monteynard and Montmorency families, then to the Duke of Lévis Ventadour. Hercule de Rohan, prince of Soubise, inherited it and his family still owned it when the French Revolution broke out.\n\nThe tolls were abolished with the of aristocratic privileges during the French Revolution, and the enclave of l'Hers was attached to the new department of Vaucluse.\n\nToday the château is private property. At the winery that takes its name, Marcel Georges elaborates a red Châteauneuf-du-pape with a base of Syrah, Mourvèdre, Muscardin, Counoise, Cinsault, Grenache, Vaccarese and Terret, and a white Châteauneuf-du-pape which blends Picardan, Roussanne, Clairette, Picpoul and white Grenache. With an area of 14 \"hectares\", it's one of the rare wineries allowed to use the name, which is an appellation d'origine controllée, to offer the full array of the thirteen Châteauneuf-du-Pape varieties.\n\nAlthough the winery kept the name of the château it does not include the name in its business since the château lies outside the Appellation d'origine contrôlée terroir. Only the lower chamber of the medieval keep and the 14th-century round tower remain of the château, along with a few vestiges of the ramparts. The site was registered as a \"monument historique\" in 1973.\n"}
{"id": "49692832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49692832", "title": "Coloniality of gender", "text": "Coloniality of gender\n\nThe coloniality of gender is a concept developed by feminist philosopher María Lugones, which she defines as \"the analysis of racialized, capitalist, gender oppression\", while the process of potentially overcoming this practice can be defined as \"decolonial feminism\". Central to these terms is the definition and recognition of indigenous social structures and their relation to land, and the articulation of how these epistemologies occupy an oppositional consciousness to colonial systems of social, sexual, ecological, spatial, and temporal hierarchy. María Lugones describes this difference as the 'oppressing ←→ resisting' relationship.\n\nColonialism of gender has altered the indigenous sense of self, identity and to the larger extent their cosmology and gender relationships. With the colonization of indigenous groups, it allowed European to implement their idea of gender and sex. This covered up the preexisting conception of sex and gender in the indigenous group during the pre-colonialism times. This is evident with the lack of representation or awareness in Western society for the indigenous concept of being \"Two Spirited\" The idea of gender itself was believed to be introduced by Western colonizers as a way to distinct two dualistic social categories which are men and women. The colonizers had introduced the idea of gender itself into Indigenous groups as this was originally a colonial concept which was made to organize production, territory and behavior. The desire for the colonizer to put forth the idea of gender onto an Indigenous group was to have control over their labor, authority, influence their subjectivity and ideas of sexuality.\n\nAccording to Glen Sean Coulthard in his essay \"For the Land: the Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination\", Indigenous resistances against \"capitalist imperialism\" can be understood as struggles surrounding the question of land and knowledge-based practices encompassing the \"relation to one another and our surroundings in a respectful, nondominating and nonexploitative way\". Coulthard defines this system of relationality as \"grounded normativity\" stating, \"the late Lakota philosopher Vine Deloria Jr. argues that one of the most significant differences that exist between Indigenous and Western metaphysics revolves around the central importance of land to Indigenous modes of being, thought, and ethics\". Further to this, Coulthard argues that Indigenous \"philosophies of nonoppression\" are defined through spatial as well as temporal relationships. Lugones refers to these Western-versus-Indigenous epistemologies as 'cosmologies' in her essay \"Toward a Decolonial Feminism\", where she analyzes these structures in relation to the colonial imposition of gender binaries on Indigenous communities.\n\nAccording to Lugones, colonial modernity is positioned as \"the dichotomous hierarchy between the human and the non-human\", summarized by Lugones' use of the term \"colonial difference\". Lugones states that within the context of colonization in the Americas and the Caribbean, this hierarchy was employed as a tactic of subordination of the colonized to \"Western man\". Lugones argues that related hierarchies were constructed by colonizers to create a binary division between men and women, describing this distinction as \"a mark of the human and a mark of civilization. Only the civilized are men or women,\" which excluded Indigenous peoples and Africans as being non-human animals, while upholding the status of \"bourgeois European women\" as passive reproductive servants of \"white bourgeois\" male colonizers. According to Lugones, colonial relations of power constructed through such binaries constitute the \"colonial difference\", a term with open-ended origins that Lugones attributes to Walter Mignolo's book \"Local Histories/Global Designs\".\n\nLogones has stated that colonial notions of femininity as inversions of masculinity did not grant human status, but rather established a gender dimorphism of hypersexuality and sexual passivity that rendered colonized \"men\" and \"women\" as non-human gendered entities. Through the performance of colonial anthropocentrism and the disruption of Indigenous cosmologies of grounded normativity, extreme acts of sexualized violence could be justified towards gendered and dehumanized colonized subjects, as stated by Lugones. Lugones writes that through murder and rape, control of colonized bodies institutionalized the internalization of colonial systems. Religious indoctrination, with divisions between good and evil equating colonized females with Satan, arguably established not only a colonization of bodies, but of memory. Systematic replications of these ideologies, according to Lugones, facilitated the erasure of Indigenous cosmologies of reciprocal relations to place, psychologically clearing the way for the re-appropriation of land toward the implementation of capitalist projects.\n\nWithin Lugones' analysis of Mignolo's usage of the colonial difference is her assertion that the colonial difference (and the coloniality of gender) is \"not an affair of the past\"; as such, as a contemporary phenomenon, Lugones argues that seeking parity with the colonizer by erasing colonial difference does not eliminate oppression. Rey Chow terms the act of seeking parity with the colonizer as \"the ascendancy of whiteness\", which Arvin, Tuck and Morrill further elaborate as taking part in the colonial \"settling process\" to dispossess \"'other-ed' peoples globally\". Instead, Lugones proposes a \"feminist border thinking\" that positions learning from subalternity at the colonial difference as central to a decolonial feminism. This concept embraces movements toward coalitional social relations between feminists of color, which Lugones describes as \"the oppositional consciousness of a social erotics.\"\n\nIn this context, according to Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill, \"Indigenous communities' concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights within a nation-state, but instead achieving substantial independence from a Western nation-state—independence decided on their own terms.\"\n\nSome researchers believe that contact with patriarchal, European colonial contact reduced the value of Indigenous women in Canadian society. According to them, colonialism greatly shifted the role of women in Indigenous communities through patriarchal laws and regulations placed on marriage and other sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men, to whom the Indigenous people were viewed as inferior. Legal impositions on sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men resulted in such relations to have underlying monetary agendas, a commodification of women that caused many Indigenous women to involve themselves in prostitution. During this Indigenous people as a whole were encouraged to adopt what European Canadians and the Canadian government considered to be \"Canadian culture\", eschewing their native culture and traditions in favor of assimilation.\n\nThe emergence of the Canadian Indian residential school system in 1847 contributed to the systemic racism, violence, and sexual mistreatment of Indigenous people, which led to the normalization and repeated occurrence of this abuse. Cindy Hanson feels that this has contributed to a lingering sense of trauma among Indigenous women and girls that has caused them to become further victimized and disenfranchised, as well as impact how they interact with their families and communities. The issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls has been cited by researchers such as Robyn Bourgeois as an example of how colonial exploitation has led to systemic racism, causing Indigenous women to be stereotyped or discriminated against as dirty, sexually indiscriminate bodies that can be violated and thrown away.\n\nThe impact of colonialism of gender is evidently seen in Canada with Indigenous women as they often migrate to urban areas due to a lack of education and opportunities in general. While there is a lack of survey regarding the migration of indigenous people from rural to urban the 1991 Aboriginal People's Survey suggests that 61% of Aboriginal people have moved at some point in their life indicating their strong desire to seek out better career and livelihood. In 1970 and 1980, the \"Indian Act\" created by Canadian government dictating Indigenous women as the act controlled their status, land, resources...etc. This act made it so if an indigenous women marries an individual without the same status, the women will lose their status. Since making this act obsolete. the number of registered Indians doubled as many were reinstated. This is seen in 1985 there were approximately 360,000 registered and 778.000 in 2007. Indigenous women are seen to be most affected by Colonialism of Gender as there are many missing reports or homicides among Aboriginal females. A study shows that between 1980 and 2012, a total of 1,017 Aboriginal female were homicide victims and 164 women currently missing with additional 225 unsolved cases. As of November 4, 2013, 11.3% (1,455 total) female were considered missing.\n\nNot only has the idea of gender and sexuality changed due to colonialism, but power distribution and family structure as well. In the pre-colonial times, Indigenous families were not organized through an authoritative figure but rather it was more communal. Some pre-colonial Indigenous communities were matrilineal and gave women very powerful roles within the society.\n\nThis drastically changed once they became colonized, European values and structures were enforced onto this community thus covering their pre-existing idea of gender and family. European societies were placed power onto the men and families were patrilinal rather than matrilineal. In colonized societies, men often are the head of the family which allows them to make important decisions while the women are often seen more submissive and plays a supportive role for the men. This contrasted with the Indigenous way of life as Cree women were believed to be the center of life and Iroquois women were given spiritual roles and control over food for the community. A German philosopher Immanuel Kant comments on the different gender power the Indigenous communities has compared to those who are colonized, as he says \"'Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada. They assemble and deliberate upon the most important regulations of the nation'\".(Kant, 1997)\n\nPrior to the 1945 independence, the role of women only revolved around the household. To be a good woman is to be a good wife that provide support for the family. It was not until 1941 that women were allowed access to education as it would increase the possibility for Indonesia to gain independence. After the independence in 1945, the role of women in society has expanded beyond the domestic sphere and the National Women’s Congress keep in touch with women’s organizations abroad. For example, the government allowed women to be involved in activities such as police work training and other national defense related institutions, which would be considered out of the ordinary before. \n\nAccording to the 2014 World Development Indicators, labour participation rate of Indonesian women from the age of fifteen is 51.4%, which is considered low by international standards. Although the gender pay gap is 5.3 %, Indonesian women are relatively paid more than men. It is because gender pay gap also included underemployment rate. For instance, the number of women working in higher position are lacking compared to male.\n\nMegawati Soekarnopoetri, the daughter of the first president of Republic of Indonesia, was elected as the first female ruler of the country in 2001 after her predecessor was impeached. She served as president until 2004 . Currently, Indonesia has eight female ministers that are in office, in which seven of them has received international recognition such as Best Minister in the World Award at the World Government Summit 2018 that was given to Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani.\n\nAccording to the data collected by the World Economic Forum in 2013, women in Indonesia has equal or nearly equal education participation rate to men. The female-to-male ratio in secondary education is one, meaning that the number enrolled is equal. A figure that started the fight for women’s right to education is Kartini. During the colonial period, she opened up the first school for native girls in Indonesia with the help of her sisters. At that time, girls do not have the opportunity to get education. Her legacy continued with the founding of Kartini School in Batavia, three years after she passed away.\n\nWomen’s participation in entrepreneurship is still low, with ‘only 23% of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises are owned by women’. Although 45% of manufacturing business owners are women, they mostly relied on unpaid female workers while businesses owned by male have more paid workers.\n\nThere are many women’s organizations in Indonesia that are based on various interest of its members. One of the well-known organizations is Dharma Wanita Persatuan (DWP), composed of the wives of government employees. The younger generation are more focused on gender equality, preventing sexual assault and empowerment. A few organisations include National Commission on Violence Against Women, Hollaback! Jakarta, Community Legal Aid Institute. The organisations mentioned, along with several others, participate in the ‘Women’s March’ in 2018, a rally to voice out their opinion regarding gender-based violence in Indonesia.\n\nIn the year 1893-1907, the French had colonized Laos along with Vietnam and Cambodia incorporating into French Cochin China. During the colonisation, the country is popular among French colonials by the interest of accommodating by Lao women or Annamite mistresses. The French did not want to live in traditional Lao way and look at Lao women as temporary wives, they expect Lao women to adapted to European style and European architectural. In addition, most women and girls are serve as servant or mistress. \n\nLao colonisation last for several years until the World War II, Japanese had occupy Laos. ( Japanese occupation of Laos) . Since the 1957, women are formally equal in the eye of state however, gender is how the social practices are organised besides age. But in 1975 Lao women’s concerns were first formally addressed by national government. The Lao People Revolutionary Party, the new communist establishment had guarantee on equality between women and men in all fields, economic, cultural, social and political, also the neglect toward women.\n\nDespite women contribution in the developing of Lao, the gender data on health education and political show that women still absence to political power and basis services. However, Lao women still related to national level through the Lao Women Union (LWU) and the only female minister is the president of the LWU.\n\nEducation status of women in Laos has improve significantly since 1975, the percentage of female students in school increase from 37,6% to 45,3% in 1980. In regards of salary, educated women tend to face inequalities5. However, the overall average education level of Lao women still lower than men. \n\nWomen and men are equal in regards of legal right. Many families take part in agriculture, farming. Also, work is divide by gender role, women are often take care of their child, cooking maintaining the household and household finance.women who live in urbanised area work in companies and civil service position. Men mostly is the head of family and decision maker.\n\nThe gender inequality and gender issues tend to conflict with urban areas and rural areas, but overall women are still mainly seen as a home maker or care taker. However, they are still opportunities for women to hold positions in many industries and work area. \n\nUnder the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, China is a male-dominated society while women had a relatively subordinate familial role which they were assumed to be taking care of housework and children. While for Hong Kong, due to the emergence of western culture during the british colonial period, westernization leads to a mix of traditional chinese thoughts and western culture and a significant different women roles in Hong Kong were found. \n\nThe labour force participation rate for women increased gradually from 48.7% in 2004 to 50.7% in 2014. On the other hand, the labour force participation rate of men decreased from 71.6% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2014. 2 In 2017, there are 45.8% female and 54.2% males recorded in the employment rate, this indicated the equal and fair workplaces between male and female. There are different rights for the employed women including maternity protection and sick leave, however, there are different difficulties women facing for example some companies required a male supervisor instead of a female one.\n\nAccording to the Women and Men Hong Kong Key Statistics 2018 Edition, there is 331 thousand female employed person, excluding foreign domestic helper, earned more than 30,000per month. 542.4 thousand male employed person earned more than 30,000 per month. contribution towards economic development by women is relatively lower than male these days. Although more Hong Kong women than men are attaining tertiary education, but are earning less than men across all professions. \n\nAccording to data collected in the Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015, the ratio of male and female in the Executive council is 23:6. Although the number of women who participated in the executive council is low, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CE) 2017 is known as Carrie Lam who is the first female CE in the history. This allocated the rise of women participation in politics.\n\nIn the past, under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, for those family who are not affordable to send all children to school, they are prioritising their son to attend school. However, after the british control, people realise the education system should have changed and discovered the importance of being educated. The education opportunities in Hong Kong are comparatively fair since the Hong Kong government is providing a 12-year free education including 6 years primary school and 6 year secondary school education. Parents are compulsory to send their children to school or stay-home study for special needs, thus all teenagers in Hong Kong can be well-educated.\n\nFor both gender in Hong Kong, they are getting married later in their life since women are getting more independent and bare a higher responsibility in their work forces. Traditional marriage values are less important and women are less relying on men in nowadays society. People agreed that the household income should be contributed from both husband and wife, thus, women are getting their own job as well instead of being a housewife only.\n\nThere are several common communities protecting Hong Kong women’s rights. The Hong Kong Federation of women founded by 11 prominent ladies was established on 28 June 1993. Members of the federation came from various levels, occupations, races, and districts in Hong Kong. Amongst members are business women, professionals, workers and housewives as well as those who are fervent in women development and advancement.Their goal is to unite women from all walks of life, to encourage them taking an active interest in Hong Kong affairs, to improve and protect the lawful rights of women and to liaise with women organizations all over the world.\n\nThrough modernisation and western influence, women status and role are changed. In the past, women were very much seen as second class citizens. They had no rights or possessions and were subservient to their husbands. Women are expected to marry, produce heirs, and take care of the household. Marriage was often arranged and it is a contract between families. However, after western influence, women are making strides toward equality in Japan. Equality benefits men as much as it does women for example becoming more acceptable to want a career. \n\nThe government takes credit for adding about 1m women to the workforce since 2012. At 66%, the female participation rate is now among the highest in the world. That is largely the result, say critics, of Japan’s drum-tight labour market rather than of innovative policies. Mindful that most of these jobs are far down the corporate totem pole, the government has also revived a decade-old target of having women occupy 30% of “leadership positions” by 2020. But it admits that this goal is nowhere near being met. In 2016, the female employment rate reach 48.9%, being one of the leading countries regarding economic key factors, showing a very low unemployment rate compared to other major industrial and emerging countries. In order to encourage women get their job, there is in-house babysitting service for the employee essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce. \n\nWomen participation in the labour force in the early development process indicates that they had a much larger role to play in the development process of Japan, which brought about such high economic growth in a short period of time. In the context of the broader debate over whether economic development expands or restricts women's economic opportunities and status, Japan illustrates that the employment patterns of married women and the degree of gender equality is not similar to that of the industrialised west. The association between women's higher education attainment and labour market participation after marriage, which can be observed in the US and most other industrialised societies, is weak for Japan largely due to the cultural and institutional factors. The export-oriented economic growth of Japan, which depended largely on the female reserve labour available at a low cost and used as a buffer to cyclical fluctuations, actually discouraged a large proportion of female workers from job seeking and they retired from the labour market.\n\nJapanese women have been participants in a long history of social activism. But their participation in politics and political parties, is a more recent phenomenon. NGOs and other grassroots organisations have provided training, information and assisted with fund-raising to equip women to participate in the leadership positions in politics, especially at the local government levels. However, most political parties still continue to provide only limited leadership opportunities for women. Tokyo’s first female governor Koike Yuriko’s political background is in national politics. Before working the office of Tokyo governor, she was a member of the long-ruling government party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and had a seat in the national legislative assembly. She was influential in the preparation of policies to better utilise women’s labour largely as a strategy of improving the economy, so her commitment to “women’s empowerment” is unquestionable. She is interested in encouraging women to participate more in the workforce and take an active part in the capitalist economy.\n\nIn the past, during the early stage of building modern education system, educational opportunities for girls were considerably disadvantaged. The attendance rate of girls were particularly low in the compulsory elementary school. Limited opportunities for girls to access secondary school was provided while higher education for women was not even supposed. Japanese government has developed policies and efforts for promoting education for girls and young females and encourage them to study with males. Conditions for women’s education have been gradually improved. As a result, in elementary education, gender gap in schooling was dissolved until the first decade of the 20th century. There is no gender gap in the opportunity for education in Japan recently, difference of enrollment ratios between male and female students in the upper secondary education and higher education levels is scarcely present. Enrollment of female students in the secondary vocational schools had been increasing gradually.\n\nIn the past, the head of the household was responsible for finding a marriage partner for the family’s heir. Married women were expected to produce an heir. Traditionally, women are expected to submit to male authority in three ways. When young, she submits to her father; When married, she submits to her husband; When old, she submits to her sons. Motherhood is considered the defining characteristic of a woman. Besides, housework, child care, and elder care each day are daily household taken up by women at home\nThus, a lot of young Japanese women struggle to form their own sense of identity apart from this cultural expectation.\n\nThere are differenet association founded in Japan. For Empowering Women (FEW), Founded in 1981 as an organization for “Foreign Executive Women”, has long been a stable source of support and learning for international women in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas. It is an exceptionally active and ever-growing Tokyo-based nonprofit business and social networking organization whose mission is to “enable internationally-minded women in Japan to achieve their full professional and personal potential.” FEW organise exciting line-up of personal and professional development workshops and opportunities to support women’s empowerment annually. \n\n"}

The spelling is the anglicized version of the Hindustani word and as a colloquial Indian English word with this meaning, it appears in the \"Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases\" (1903). Banditry is criminal activity involving robbery by groups of armed bandits. The East India Company established the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1830, and the Thuggee and Dacoity Suppression Acts, 1836–1848 were enacted in British India under East India Company rule. Areas with ravines or forests, such as Chambal and Chilapata Forests, were once known for dacoits.\n\nThe word \"dacoity\", the anglicized version of the Hindustani word \"ḍakaitī\" (historically spelled \"dakaitee\", Hindi डकैती or Urdu ڈکیتی or Bengali ডাকাতি, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି ), comes from \"ḍākū\" (historically spelled \"dakoo\", Hindi: डाकू, Urdu: ڈاکو, meaning \"armed robber\") or Bengali \"ḍakat\" (ডাকাত, or Odiya ଡକାୟତି).\n\nIn Urdu, \"ḍākū\" ڈاکو is singular and \"ḍakait\" ڈکیت plural for bandits. The crime of banditry is known as \"dakaitee\" ڈکیتی.\n\nIn Hindi, \"dacoity\" (Hindi: डकैती \"ḍakaitī\", Urdu: ڈکیتی \"ḍakaitī\", Bengali: ডাকাতি \"ḍakati\", or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means \"armed robbery\".\n\nThe term dacoit (Hindi: डकैत \"ḍakait\", Urdu: ڈکیت \"ḍakait\", Bengali: ডাকাত \"ḍākāt\", or Odiya ଡକାୟତି) means \"a bandit\", according to the \"OED\" (\"A member of a class of robbers in India and Burma, who plunder in armed bands\").\n\nThe dacoity have had a large impact in the Morena and Chambal regions in Madhya Pradesh in north-central India. The emergence of dacoity in the Chambal valley has been a popular theme (Bhaduri, 1972; Khan, 1981; Jatar, 1980; Katare, 1972). Most explanations have simply suggested feudal exploitation as the cause that provoked many people of this region to take to arms. However, the fact that many gangs operating in this valley were composed of higher castes and wealthy people appears to suggest that feudalism may only be a partial explanation of dacoity in Chambal valley.\n\nThe term is also applied, according to the \"OED\", to \"pirates who formerly infested the Ganges between Calcutta and Burhampore\".\n\nDacoits existed in Burma as well – Rudyard Kipling's fictional Private Mulvaney hunted Burmese dacoits in \"The Taking of Lungtungpen\". Sax Rohmer's criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu also employed Burmese dacoits as his henchmen. \n\nIndian police forces use \"Known Dacoit\" (K.D.) as a label to classify criminals.\n\nNotable dacoits include:\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, women belonging to a village defence group have been issued firearm permits to fend off dacoity. The chief minister of the state, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, recognised the role the women had played in defending their villages without guns. He stated that he wanted to enable these women to better defend both themselves and their villages, and issued the gun permits to advance this goal.\n\nAs the dacoits flourished through the 1940s–1970s, they were the subject of various Hindi films made during this era, leading to the emergence of the dacoit film genre in Bollywood. The genre began with Mehboob Khan's \"Aurat\" (1940), which he remade as \"Mother India\" (1957). \"Mother India\" received an Academy Award nomination, and defined the dacoit film genre, along with Dilip Kumar's \"Gunga Jumna\" (1961). Other popular films in this genre included Raj Kapoor’s \"Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai\" (1961) and Moni Bhattacharjee's \"Mujhe Jeene Do\" (1963).\n\nPakistani actor Akmal Khan had two dacoit films, \"Malangi\" (1965) and \"Imam Din Gohavia\" (1967). Other films in this genre included \"Khote Sikkay\" (1973), \"Mera Gaon Mera Desh\" (1971), and \"Kuchhe Dhaage\" (1973) both by Raj Khosla.\n\nThe most famous dacoit film is \"Sholay\" (1975), written by Salim-Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan, and with its dacoit character Gabbar Singh played by Amjad Khan. It was a masala film that combined the dacoit film conventions of \"Mother India\" and \"Gunga Jumna\" with that of Spaghetti Westerns, spawning the Dacoit Western genre, often known as the \"Curry Western\" genre. \"Sholay\" became a classic in the genre, and its success led to a surge of films in this genre, including \"Ganga Ki Saugandh\" (1978), once again starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amjad Khan.\n\nPunjabi biopic \"Jatt Jeona Morh\" about the noted dacoit Jatt Jeona Morh, was made in 1991; also in that same year came \"Jagga Daku\", based on a noted outlaw and dacoit during the British Raj, Jagga Daku.\n\nAn internationally acclaimed example of the genre is \"Bandit Queen\" (1994).\n\nTamil movie, Karthi starrer \"Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru\" (2017) deals elaborately about Bandits. The film reveals the real dacoity incidents which held in Tamil Nadu between 1995 and 2005. Director Vinoth did a 2 year research about Bandits to develop the script.\n\nA related genre of crime films are Mumbai underworld films.\n\nA Hindi novel पैंसठ लाख की डकैती (Painstth Lakh ki Dacoity, 1977) was written by Surender Mohan Pathak; it was translated as \"The 65 Lakh Heist\".\n\nDacoits armed with pistols and swords appear in \"\".\n\nThey frequently appeared in the French language \"Bob Morane\" series of novels by Henri Vernes, principally as the main thugs or assassins of the hero's recurring villain, Mr. Ming.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57092372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57092372", "title": "Family policy in the United Kingdom", "text": "Family policy in the United Kingdom\n\nFamily policy in the United Kingdom has experienced numerous shifts throughout the nation’s history. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the UK had one of the most liberal family planning regimes in Europe, with little state involvement. However, this began to shift during the Industrial Revolution, and especially during the post-war years and the New Labour era. The post-recession Conservative era has initiated reforms to the comparatively broad family provisions.\n\nHistorically, the United Kingdom has had a limited approach towards family planning, primarily because of policymakers’ belief on a “classic liberal” conception of the welfare state. This implied a reliance on free-market solutions and a state reluctant to fund welfare provisions for families. Laws passed in the 17th and 18th centuries regarding families were rare and generally aimed at fixing “inefficiencies” in the system or addressing the most serious societal issues stemming from marriage. For example, in 1753, English law mandated that minors under the age of 21 could only marry if provided consent by their parents. However, Scotland resisted this law and maintained its comparatively loose marriage laws; for a long time, Gretna Green, the first village in Scotland on the London-Edinburgh route, was a popular place for runaway lovers who wanted to marry. Overall, the UK’s laws were far more liberal than other states in Europe. It was only during the Industrial Revolution that these views began to change, and the Welfare State in the UK began to emerge; with it, family policy changed considerably.\n\nThe post-war conditions in UK led to numerous momentous changes in family policy. One of the most important trends was the shift in the historical conception of the male as the breadwinner and the female as the homemaker. Divorce was made easier to obtain. In 1969, Parliament passed the Divorce Reform Act, which established the no-fault divorce; the effect of these and other change was the increase of divorce from 2.1 out of 1000 in 1961 to 12.7 in 1987. The UK state hit its peak when it comes to family policy during the New Labour era, which came to power in 1997. New and wide-ranging initiatives that centered on the family were established. These included “children’s early education and care, services to stabilise and improve the quality of family relations especially in low-income sectors of the population, parental employment and greater flexibility in work and family life.” Some of these proposals were heavily controversial, since the New Labour’s emphasis on “Strengthening marriages.” Many skeptics viewed this as the state promoting “desirable family forms” at the expense of newer methods in today’s diverse family life.\n\nThe post-recession environment though has led policymakers to implement austerity measures on what became a relatively vast welfare state regarding families.  Conservatives in Parliament have been influenced by a policy of “smaller state, bigger society,” i.e. a lesser role for the government and a greater one for civil society. For instance, the UK budget in 2015 announced the end of tax credits for families for their third or subsequent child. Though Treasury officials denied that this move was an attempt to influence families on how many children they should have, critics labeled it a de facto “two-child policy”. However, indications point to the Conservative government limiting austerity-driven proposals, as Prime Minister Theresa May has introduced 30 hours of free child care for three and four year olds.\n\n"}

{"id": "42199148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42199148", "title": "Internal conflict in Azawad", "text": "Internal conflict in Azawad\n\nThe Internal conflict in Azawad has been a two-year-long insurgency in Northern Mali between a pro-independence ultra Nationalist group, the MNLA and a coalition of Islamists terror groups. The conflict began when Northern Mali declared itself independent from the government creating the un-recognized state of Azawad. Both the Islamists and MNLA formed an alliance in combatting the Malian government. An internal conflict sprung up over the imposing of sharia law in the new state and the MNLA distancing itself from the coalition to a democratic state. Islamists gained popularity amongst anti-Tuareg tribes that helped it overthrow MNLA authority in Gao. Both sides clashed repeatedly leading to the Battle of Gao where the MNLA were driven from the North's two main cities, Gao and Timbuktu. The MNLA soon lost all of its strongholds in the North in a matter of months. They went into hiding secretly gaining support and strength. The beginning of 2013 led the start of the French intervention in Mali that ousted the Islamists from the North's cities and brought back Malian authority. The MNLA supported the French and Chadian forces in military operations against Islamists sanctuaries in the mountains. The MNLA recaptured several important towns in the Kidal Region but refused to dis-arm or hand them over to the Malian government. A series of Islamists sponsored terror attacks plagued MNLA forces for siding with the French. Checkpoints and bases were targeted with suicide bombings that targeted MNLA members. A peace deal was reached with the Malian army in June that let the army transverse freely in MNLA occupied zones that were under Malian jurisdiction. Ethnic violence sprung over the murder of a Tuareg Government officers family. The MNLA responded by harassing and murdering Fulani civilians who create a majority of Islamists rebels. The Islamists stepped up their attacks in one such instance massacring 30 Tuareg merchants. The MNLA has since been battling Islamists.\n\nSince its Independence in April 2012, the MNLA has been skeptical of Islamist influence over their new state's future and the implementation of sharia law. Various countries including France have denounced the MNLA's cooperation with terror groups and refused to recognize its new status due to various incidents in its fight against the Malian government which included a massacre that killed 93 Malian soldiers allegedly carried out by Islamists. Two main incidents occurred on the streets of Gao that caused confusion when civilians waving the Malian flag were fired upon by MNLA members which was denied by the MNLA itself, blamed on Islamists. Many did not support the new state of Azawad and Tuareg dominance over their land. Islamists popularity and influence grew in numbers eventually outnumbering MNLA defenders in Gao. The city was taken on June 27, over an argument that escalated into a full-scale battle. The MNLA Secretary General Bilal Ag Acherif was wounded in the battle that also killed four colonels. The MNLA's headquarters and any government building was looted along with the Azawad flag being replaced with sharia. Timbuktu was evacuated by the MNLA a day later after an ultimatum to leave. Resistance grew against Islamic rule in MNLA supported towns but never posed a great threat. On 16 November, the MNLA launched an offensive attack to reclaim their former city base of Gao from Islamists. They did not make it far before their army routed and was chased across the Niger border. Nine MNLA members were wounded, including one seriously. Islamists casualties were 13 dead. Four days later the Islamists launched their own offensive against towns with MNLA presence. The town of Ménaka's defenders were capitulated in a two-day siege that killed one MNLA member and seven pro-MNLA selfdefense volunteers including a prominent political leader Alwabegat Ag Salakatou. Its disputed how many Islamists were killed. The MNLA hoped to establish Ménaka as a central base from which to launch counter-attacks. In December, the now displaced MNLA began peace talks with the Malian government and relinquished its previous goal for Independence in favor of self-rule in Northern Mali. Almost half of the MNLA's combatants deserted for better pay in Islamists factions since the declaration of Independence in April 2012. At this time the MNLA controlled no big localities and was only strong in rural desert areas in the North, having been driven off from its proposed state cities in the South. Troop build ups in the MNLA ranks were reportedly preparing for another offensive.\n\nAt the start of 2013, the MNLA retook its key town of Kidal after it was abandoned by French air-strikes. The Azawad flag was raised in every town they took each one without a fight. Islamists guerrillas operating the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains launched an offensive of their own terrorizing MNLA dominated towns with suicide bombings. The first hit the town of Khalil on 22 February, after an explosion ripped at an MNLA checkpoint killing three members. The second in that week killed seven members at another checkpoint in Kidal. Fighting resumed the next month leading to the Battle of In Arab. Five members were killed in a day long battle with an elite terrorist brigade led by Mokhtar belMokhtar, the Signatories of Blood. In June 2013, the MNLA agreed on a cease-fire with the Malian army allowing them to have authority over MNLA occupied towns, granting autonomy for Tuareg civilians, and dis-arming the MNLA with an exception for self-defense purposes into a political organization. The MNLA also agreed upon taking back its claim for Independence instead for greater autonomy. The peace-deal lasted over three months before both sides claimed it was breached. In November, the Islamists suspected murder of members of a Tuareg Malian army general's family led to an ethnic conflict between MNLA Tuareg and Islamists dominated Fulani. The situation escalated in February 2014, when 30-35 Tuareg merchants were massacred at the hands of Fulani Islamists. Reprisal attacks targeting Fulani Islamists resumed into an armed confrontation that killed a MNLA member.\n"}

When performing dzhigitovka, the riders at full gallop stand up, jump to the ground and back to the saddle, pick up objects from the ground (such as coins, hats, etc.), shoot targets with various weapons, ride hanging on the side or under the belly of the horse and do other acrobatic feats.\n\nSince the early 19th century jigitovka has been demonstrated in the circuses and horse sport competitions, and made its way to the popular Western culture, for instance Russian Cossacks (actually Georgian horsemen from western part of Georgia, Guria) demonstrated jigitovka as part of \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\" Show. Jigitovka was also used in training of cavalry forces in the Russian Empire and USSR. Modern jigitovka as a circus performance includes complex stunts usually performed by a group of riders.\n\nRecently, a sport known as equestrian jigitovka was developed in Russia. It became an officially certified discipline in the Russian Equestrian Federation in 2016; world championships in the sport have been held since the same year. This sport is performed on a horse cantering along a track 150-300 m long and at least 4 m wide, with two 40 m \"chutes\" for trick performance. The sport has multiple phases and includes both the performance of traditional acrobatic tricks and the use of weapons on horseback.\n\nThe weapons section of an equestrian jigitovka competition includes five types of weapon. Generally, it is carried out in two rounds; during the first, the rider must carry four types of weapon and use them all on a course with various targets. During the first round, the rider first demonstrates different spear strikes, then tosses the spear through a hoop and moves on to other weapons: pistol (an air pistol), throwing knife, and sword. The sword is a traditional Cossack shashka, which is slightly curved. Sword targets can include branches, bottles, and rope. During the second round, the rider uses only a bow and arrow, and must hit three targets with different shots: forward, sideways, and backward.\n\nThe trick section of an equestrian jigitovka competition involves the performance of six tricks. According to Russian rules, these tricks are to be performed in one round over three laps of the track. The international rules specify three rounds, each consisting of two tricks performed over one lap of the track. The exercises can be static or active, and are divided into four groups according to their complexity. Static exercises must be held between two flags on the track, about 10 m apart. Active exercises involve constant motion, for example, jumping off and on the horse (vaulting). If a rider successfully performs an exercise, they receive a score from 1 to 10 points, which is multiplied by the trick's coefficient; the number of each difficulty level is the coefficient for those tricks. For example, a \"Cossack hang\" off the saddle is a first level trick, that is, an easy one, so its coefficient is one; a shoulder stand is a difficult, fourth level trick, so its coefficient is four.\n\n"}
{"id": "6081403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6081403", "title": "Koryo-saram", "text": "Koryo-saram\n\nKoryo-saram (; ) or Koryoin () is the name which ethnic Koreans in the post-Soviet states use to refer to themselves. The term is composed of two constituents: \"\"Koryo\", which is one of the names of Korea, and \"saram\"\", meaning either \"person/people\". Approximately 500,000 ethnic Koreans reside in the former Soviet Union, primarily in the now-independent states of Central Asia. There are also large Korean communities in southern Russia (around Volgograd), the Caucasus, and southern Ukraine. These communities can be traced back to the Koreans who were living in the Russian Far East during the late 19th century.\n\nThere is also a separate ethnic Korean community on the island of Sakhalin, typically referred to as Sakhalin Koreans. Some may identify as Koryo-saram, but many do not. Unlike the communities on the Russian mainland, which consist mostly of immigrants from the late 19th century and early 20th century, the ancestors of the Sakhalin Koreans came as immigrants from Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces in the late 1930s and early 1940s, forced into service by the Japanese government to work in coal mines in Sakhalin (then known as Karafuto Prefecture) in order to fill labour shortages caused by World War II.\n\nThe word \"Koryo\" in \"Koryo-saram\" originated from the name of the Goryeo (Koryŏ) Dynasty from which \"Korea\" was derived. The name \"Soviet Korean\" was also used, more frequently before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russians may also lump Koryo-saram under the general label \"koreytsy\" (); however, this usage makes no distinctions between ethnic Koreans of the local nationality and the Korean nationals (citizens of North Korea or South Korea).\n\nIn Standard Korean, the term \"Koryo-saram\" is typically used to refer to historical figures from the Goryeo dynasty; to avoid ambiguity, Korean speakers use a word \"Goryeoin\" (; Hanja: 高麗人, meaning the same as \"Koryo-saram\") to refer to ethnic Koreans in the post-Soviet states. However, the Sino-Korean morpheme \"-in\" (인) is not productive in Koryo-mal, the dialect spoken by Koryo-saram, and as a result, only a few (mainly those who have studied Standard Korean) refer to themselves by this name; instead, Koryo-saram has come to be the preferred term.\n\nThe 19th century saw the decline of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. A small population of wealthy elite owned the farmlands in the country, and poor peasants found it difficult to survive. Koreans leaving the country in this period were obliged to move toward Russia, as the border with China was sealed by the Qing Dynasty. However, the first Koreans in the Russian Empire, 761 families totalling 5,310 people, had actually migrated to Qing territory; the land they had settled on was ceded to Russia by the Convention of Peking in 1860. Many peasants considered Siberia to be a land where they could lead better lives, and so they subsequently migrated there. As early as 1863, 13 Korean households were recorded near Novukorut Bay. These numbers rose dramatically, and by 1869 Koreans composed 20% of the population of the Maritime Province. Prior to the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway, Koreans outnumbered Russians in the Russian Far East; the local governors encouraged them to naturalize. The village of Blagoslovennoe was founded in 1870 by Korean migrants. The 1897 Russian Empire Census found 26,005 Korean speakers (16,225 men and 9,780 women) in the whole of Russia.\n\nIn the early 20th century, both Russia and Korea came into conflict with Japan. Following the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1907, Russia enacted an anti-Korean law at the behest of Japan, under which the land of Korean farmers was confiscated and Korean labourers were laid off. However, Korean migration to Russia continued to grow; 1914 figures showed 64,309 Koreans (among whom 20,109 were Russian citizens). Even the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution did nothing to slow migration; in fact, after the repression of the 1919 March 1st Movement in Japanese-colonised Korea, migration actually intensified. Koreans leaders in Vladivostok's Sinhanchon (literally, \"New Korean Village\") neighbourhood also provided support to the independence movement, making it a centre for nationalist activities, including arms supply; the Japanese attacked it on April 4, 1920, leaving hundreds dead. By 1923, the Korean population in the Soviet Union had grown to 106,817. The following year, the Soviets began taking measures to control Korean population movement to their territory; however, they were not completely successful until 1931; after that date, they halted all migration from Korea and required existing migrants to naturalise as Soviet citizens.\n\nThe Soviet policy of \"korenizatsiya\" (indigenisation) resulted in the creation of 105 Korean village soviets (councils) in mixed-nationality \"raion\", as well as an entire \"raion\" for the Korean nationality, the Pos'et Korean National Raion; these conducted their activities entirely in the Korean language. The Soviet Koreans had a large number of their own official institutions, including 380 Korean schools, two teachers' colleges, one pedagogical school, three hospitals, a theatre, six journals, and seven newspapers (the largest of which, \"Vanguard\", had a circulation of 10,000). The 1937 Census showed 168,259 Koreans in the Soviet Union. However, officials in the Russian Far East viewed the Koreans' ethnic and family ties to the Japanese Empire with suspicion, which would soon set the stage for the deportation of the whole population.\n\nIn 1937, facing reports from the NKVD that the Japanese had infiltrated the Russian Far East by means of ethnic Korean spies, Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov signed Resolution 1428-326 ss, \"On the Exile of the Korean Population from border \"Raions\" of the Far East Kray\", on 21 August. According to the report of Nikolai Yezhov, 36,442 Korean families totalling 171,781 persons were deported by 25 October. The deported Koreans faced difficult conditions in Central Asia: monetary assistance promised by the government never materialised, and furthermore, most of the deported were rice farmers and fishermen, who had difficulty adapting to the arid climate of their new home. Estimates based on population statistics suggest that 40,000 deported Koreans died in 1937 and 1938 for these reasons. However, the deportees cooperated to build irrigation works and start rice farms; within three years, they had recovered their original standard of living. The events of this period led to the formation of a cohesive identity among the Korean deportees. However, in schools for Soviet Korean children, the government switched Korean language from being the medium of instruction to being taught merely as a second language in 1939, and from 1945 stopped it from being taught entirely; furthermore, the only publication in the Korean language was the \"Lenin Kichi\". As a result, subsequent generations lost the use of the Korean language, which J. Otto Pohl described as \"emasculat[ing] the expression of Korean culture in the Soviet Union. Up until the era of glasnost, it was not permitted to speak openly of the deportations.\nScholars estimated that , roughly 470,000 Koryo-saram were living in the Commonwealth of Independent States, including 198,000 in Uzbekistan, 125,000 in Russia, 105,000 in Kazakhstan, 19,000 in Kyrgyzstan, 13,000 in Ukraine, 6,000 in Tajikistan, 3,000 in Turkmenistan, 1,000 in Belarus, 500 in Moldova and 3,500 in other constituent republics.\n\nThe 2002 census gave a population of 148,556 Koreans in Russia, of which 75,835 were male and 72,721 female. About one-fourth reside in Siberia and the Russian Far East; the Korean population there trace their roots back to a variety of sources. Aside from roughly 33,000 CIS nationals, mostly migrants retracing in reverse the 1937 deportation of their ancestors, between 4,000 and 12,000 North Korean migrant labourers can be found in the region. Smaller numbers of South Koreans and ethnic Koreans from China have also come to the region to settle, invest, and/or engage in cross-border trade.\n\nIn the 2001 census in Ukraine 12,711 people defined themselves as ethnic Koreans, up from 8,669 in 1989. Of these only 17.5% gave Korean as their first language. The majority (76%) stated their mother tongue was Russian, while 5.5% stated Ukrainian. The largest concentrations can be found in Kharkiv, Kiev, Odessa, Mykolaiv, Cherkasy, Lviv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia, and Crimea. The largest ethnic representative body, the Association of Koreans in Ukraine, is located in Kharkiv, where roughly 150 Korean families reside; the first Korean language school was opened in 1996 under their direction. One of the most famous Korean-Ukrainians is Oleksandr Sin, former mayor of Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe majority of Koryo-saram in Central Asia reside in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Korean culture in Kazakhstan is centered in Almaty, the former capital. For much of the 20th century, this was the only place in Central Asia where a Korean language newspaper (the \"Koryo Shinmun\") and Korean language theater were in operation. The censuses of Kazakhstan recorded 96,500 Koryo-saram in 1939, 74,000 in 1959, 81,600 in 1970, 92,000 in 1979, 100,700 in 1989, and 99,700 in 1999.\n\nIn Kyrgyzstan, the population has remained roughly stable over the past three censuses: 18,355 (1989), 19,784 (1999), and 17,299 (2009). This contrasts sharply with other non-indigenous groups such as Germans, many of whom migrated to Germany after the breakup of the Soviet Union. South Korea never had any programme to promote return migration of their diaspora in Central Asia, unlike Germany. However, they have established organisations to promote Korean language and culture, such as the Korean Centre of Education which opened in Bishkek in 2001. South Korean Christian missionaries are also active in the country.\n\nThe population in Uzbekistan is largely scattered in rural areas. This population has suffered in recent years from linguistic handicaps, as the Koryo-saram there spoke Russian but not Uzbek. After the independence of Uzbekistan, many lost their jobs due to being unable to speak the national language. Some emigrated to the Russian Far East, but found life difficult there as well. \n\nThere is also a small Korean community in Tajikistan. Mass settlement of Koreans in the country began during the late 1950s and early 1960s, after the loosening of restrictions on their freedom of movement which had previously kept them confined to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Pull factors for migration included rich natural resources and a relatively mild climate. Their population grew to 2,400 in 1959, 11,000 in 1979, and 13,000 in 1989; most lived in the capital Dushanbe, with smaller concentrations in Qurghonteppa and Khujand. Like Koreans in other parts of Central Asia, they generally possessed higher incomes compared to members of other ethnic groups. However, with the May 1992 onset of civil war in Tajikistan, many fled the country entirely; by 1996, their population had fallen by over half to 6,300 people. Most are engaged in agriculture and retail business. Violence continued even after the end of the civil war; in 2000, suspected Hizb ut-Tahrir members exploded a bomb in a Korean Christian church in Dushanbe, killing 9 and wounding 30.\n\nThere was some minor return migration of Soviet Koreans to Korea in the first half of the 20th century. They formed 4 main groups: those sent for intelligence work during the Japanese colonial period, the Red Army personnel who arrived in 1945–1946, civilian advisors and teachers who arrived in the northern half of the peninsula in 1946–1948, and individuals who repatriated from the Soviet Union to North Korea for personal reasons. Though it was common in most of the newly socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc to receive Soviet-educated personnel who were from the country or had ancestral ethnic connections there, in North Korea such returned members of national diaspora played a more important role than in other countries.\n\nLater, labour migration to South Korea would grow to a large size. , as many as 10,000 Uzbekistani nationals worked in South Korea, with most of them being ethnic Koreans. It is estimated that remittances from South Korea to Uzbekistan exceed $100 million annually.\n\nAfter their arrival in Central Asia, the Koryo-saram quickly established a way of life different from that of neighbouring peoples. They set up irrigation works and became known throughout the region as rice farmers. They interacted little with the nomadic peoples around them, and focused on education. Although they soon ceased to wear traditional Korean clothing, they adapted Western-style dress rather than the clothing worn by the Central Asian peoples.\n\nThe ritual life of the Koryo-saram community has changed in various respects. Marriages have taken on the Russian style. At Korean traditional funerals, the coffin is taken out of the house either through the window or a single door threshold; however, if there is more than one door threshold on the way out (e.g. in modern multi-stories buildings), three notches are made on each threshold. The name of the dead is traditionally written in \"hanja\"; however, as hardly anyone is left among the Koryo-saram who can write in \"hanja\", the name is generally written in hangul only. On the other hand, the rituals for the first birthday and sixtieth anniversary have been preserved in their traditional form.\n\nKoryo-saram have preserved the Korean cuisine particularly well. The cuisine of the Koryo-saram is closest to that of the Hamgyong provinces in North Korea, and is dominated by meat soups and salty side dishes. It uses similar cooking techniques but is adapted to local ingredients, which resulted in invention of new dishes. One well-known example is spicy carrot salad, known throughout the Soviet Union as Korean-style carrot. It is a Koryo-saram invention and was unknown in South Korea until recently. However, it has gained an international following, being served in most cafeterias throughout the CIS, sold in all supermarkets, and featured regularly as a side dish on dinner tables and in holiday feasts set by all ethnicities of the former Soviet Union. On the other hand, some South Korean dishes such as bulgogi, bibimbap, and samgyeopsal were relatively unknown to Koryo-saram until recently. Dishes traditionally popular among Koryo-saram include pigodi, kuksu (Korean:국수), timpeni, khe, chartagi, kadi che (Korean:가지채), kosari che (Korean:고사리채), chirgym che, panchan, schirak tyamuri, kadyuri.\n\nMany Korean surnames, when Cyrillized, are spelled and pronounced slightly differently from the romanisations used in the U.S. and the resulting common pronunciations, as can be seen in the table at right. Some surnames of Koryo-saram have a particle \"gai\" added to them, such as Kogai or Nogai. The origin of this is unclear.\nThe introduction of international passports by newly independent CIS countries, resulted in further differences in pronunciation as Korean surnames had to be transliterated from Cyrillic into Latin. In addition to a surname, Koreans also use clan names (known as Bon-gwan in Korea and pronounced as пой among koryo saram) denoting the place of origin.\n\nKorean naming practices and Russian naming practices are different - koryo saram use Russian name practices, but Korean surnames, and sometimes Korean names. But most often Christian names are used from the saints of the Russian Orthodox Church, typical for Russians.\n\nLegislation of the Russian Empire in issuing documents required the father's name.\n\nKoreans began to use patronymic, but formed from the Korean names of their fathers. Over time, the proportion of Christians increased, they were given, in accordance with the tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church, names from the general list of revered saints. And at the moment 80% koryo saram have a record of those educated from such names.\nThis differs from the pattern typical in the US, where Korean American parents often register their children with a Korean given name as their legal middle name (e.g. Daniel Dae Kim, Harold Hongju Koh).\n\nIn Korea, until the 20th century, women had no names. Women were called by the surname of their father if there was one. Noble nobles received as a pseudo-name the name of the estate in which they lived. And this did not change when getting married.\n\nThe preservation of his wife's name has been preserved as a tradition among modern Koreans, after women began to give names.\n\nThe Koreans began to migrate to the Russian Empire in 1864 long before women were allowed to give names in modern Korean tradition in Korea.\n\nLegislation of the Russian Empire required the mandatory presence of the surname of the name and patronymic name for everyone. Including poor serf wives.\nWhen they were married they were given the surname of the husband, a patronymic formed on behalf of the father and given a name from the Sviatcy (List of names of saints of the Orthodox Church).\n\nThe Russians have declined (depending on masculinum and femminile) and not inclined surnames. The surnames of Koreans are not inclined.\n\nIn Korea, it is common for siblings and cousins of the same generation to have one hanja syllable in common among all of their names; this is known as \"dollimja\". Russians have no equivalent practice, although they do have patronyms which the Koryo-saram have for the most part adopted. Therefore, Koryo-saram does not use generation of names of this type. They use, depending on religion, either a name from Sviatcy or a name arbitrarily chosen from the hieroglyphs hanja used in Korea to form names. Beautiful in sound and meaning.\n\nDue to deportation and the continuing urbanization of the population after 1952, the command of Korean among the Koryo-saram has continued to fall. This contrasts with other more rural minority groups such as the Dungan, who have maintained a higher level of proficiency in their ethnic language. In 1989, the most recent year for which data are available, the number of Russian mother tongue speakers among the Koryo-saram population overtook that of Korean mother tongue speakers.\n\nThe 2005 South Korean film \"Wedding Campaign\", directed by Hwang Byung-kook, portrays two aging bachelor farmers from rural villages who hope to find wives. Having no romantic prospects in South Korea, they opt to go through an international mail-order bride agency, which sends them to Uzbekistan and tries to match them with Korean women there.\n\n\nKoreans of The South Ussury in 1879\n\n"}

The official languages are Dutch and Papiamento, although schools require students to learn English, Spanish, French, and to a lesser extent, Portuguese which is also spoken on the island. According to the Government of Aruba the mother tongue and primary vernacular of almost all Arubans is a local language known as Papiamento, an Afro-Portuguese Creole language spoken since the 16th century. The language, however, was not widespread in Aruba till the 18th and 19th centuries when most materials on the island and even Roman Catholic schoolbooks were written in Papiamento.\n\nDutch has been one of the official languages of the island for years as the island is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. However, Dutch is the sole language for all administrative and legal matters. Aruba has recognized English as an international language, and has required that children learn English as early as the 4th grade. Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British took Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire; when Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials noted the already widespread use of the language.. Since May 2003, Papiamento has also been an official language, alongside Dutch. Aruba's location off the coast of South America has also made Spanish extremely important. Students begin learning this as early as 5th grade. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia, and several Venezuelan TV networks are received, and the fact that Aruba has Venezuelan and Colombian residents. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.\n\nPapiamento is a language with roots mainly from Portuguese, and to a lesser extent, from Dutch, Spanish and English. It originated in the 16th century as a pidgin language for communication among slaves and slave drivers.\n\nPapiamento was not considered important on Aruba until 1995. It was officially included in the school curriculum in 1998 and 1999. Since then, the island has embraced this native language. A Papiamento dictionary and fairy tales written in Papiamento are now readily available on the island.\n\nAruba is a polyglot society. Most of Aruba's population is able to converse in at least two of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and Spanish.\n\n"}

{"id": "7081543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7081543", "title": "Mary Hays", "text": "Mary Hays\n\nMary Hays (1759–1843) was an autodidact intellectual who published essays, poetry, novels, and several works on famous (and infamous) women. She is remembered for her early feminism, and her close relations to dissenting and radical thinkers of her time including Robert Robinson, Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and William Frend. She was born in 1759, into a family of Protestant dissenters who rejected the practices of the Church of England (the established church). Hays was described by those who disliked her as 'the baldest disciple of [Mary] Wollstonecraft' by \"The Anti Jacobin Magazine\", attacked as an 'unsex'd female' by clergyman Robert Polwhele, and provoked controversy through her long life with her rebellious writings. When Hays's fiancé John Eccles died on the eve of their marriage, Hays expected to die of grief herself. But this apparent tragedy meant that she escaped an ordinary future as wife and mother, remaining unmarried. She seized the chance to make a career for herself in the larger world as a writer.\n\nHays was influenced by Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, and after writing admiringly to her, the two women became friends. The backlash following Wollstonecraft's death and posthumous publication of her Memoirs impacted Hays' later work, which some scholars have called more conservative. Among these later productions is the six-volume compendium \"\", in which Wollstonecraft is not mentioned, although Hays had written an extensive obituary for \"The Annual Necrology\" shortly after Godwin's controversial \"Memoirs\". If Wollstonecraft was neglected through the nineteenth century, Hays and her writing received even less critical evaluation or academic attention until the twentieth-century's emerging feminist movement.\n\nMary Hays was born in London 13 October 1759, the daughter of Rational Dissenters John and Elizabeth Hays.\n\nIn 1777 she met and fell in love with John Eccles. Their parents initially opposed the match but they met secretly and exchanged over 100 letters. The two were eventually engaged, but in August 1780, Eccles died of a fever. Hays wrote: \"All my pleasures – and every opening prospect are buried with him\". This spurred her to take up writing. For the next ten years she wrote essays and poems. A short story, \"Hermit: an Oriental Tale,\" was published in 1786 in \"Universal Magazine\". It was a picturesque tale that warned against feeling too much passion. She exchanged letters with Robert Robinson, a minister who campaigned against the slave trade. She attended the dissenting academy in Hackney in the late 1780s.\n\nIn 1791 she replied to Gilbert Wakefield's critique of communal worship with a pamphlet called \"Cursory Remarks on An Enquiry into the Expediency and Propriety of Public or Social Worship\", using the nom-de-plume Eusebia. The Cambridge mathematician William Frend wrote to her enthusiastically about it. This blossomed into a brief romance.\n\nIn 1792 Hays was given a copy of \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" by Mary Wollstonecraft, and it made a deep impression on her. Hays contacted the publisher of the book, Joseph Johnson, which led to her friendship with Wollstonecraft and involvement with London's Jacobin intellectual circle. Hays next wrote a book \"Letters and Essays\" (1793) and invited Mary Wollstonecraft to comment on it before publication. Although the reviews were mixed Hays decided to leave home and to try to support herself by writing. She moved to Hatton Garden. She did not have enough money to buy \"Enquiry Concerning Political Justice\" by William Godwin. Boldly she wrote to the author and asked to borrow it. This turned into a friendship, in which Godwin became a guide and teacher. She acted on Wollstonecraft's demand that women take charge of their lives and moved out of her mother's home to live as an independent woman in London. This was an extraordinary and unaccustomed act for a single woman in Hays's time: Hays’s mother was horrified, and Hays’s friends condemned her. Although Hays’s family were outsiders from mainstream British culture, Hays’s mother still disapproved of her daughter’s social rebellion.\n\nHer next work, \"Memoirs of Emma Courtney\" (1796) is probably her best-known. Hays's experiment with 'the idea of being free', and her romantic heartbreak over the Frend affair, were its subjects.\n\nThe novel draws on love letters to William Frend (who was ultimately unreceptive) and includes material taken also from her more philosophical letters in which she debated with William Godwin. The heroine, Emma, falls in love with Augustus Harley, who is the son of a dear friend, but lacking an income. Recognizing that he cannot afford marriage, she offers to live with him as his wife without getting married. Emma tells the Frend figure that her desire for him trumps every other consideration: reputation, status, and even chastity. In the most notorious statement in the book, Emma plays on Frend’s name: ‘My friend’, she cries, ‘I would give myself to you – the gift is not worthless’. In real life and in the novel, Frend rejected Hays.\n\nReaders were shocked at her inclusion of real letters she had exchanged with Godwin and Frend. Hays's disgrace was juicy gossip in the close-knit group of London publishing. In 1800 Scottish writer Elizabeth Hamilton published \"Memoirs of Modern Philosophers\", a novel that satirised Hays as a sex-hungry man-chaser, and Hays became a laughingstock throughout Britain.\n\nHays and Godwin fell out, and she turned her attention to other writers, including Robert Southey and unfortunately Charles Lloyd. There is no known portrait of her in later life, but Samuel Taylor Coleridge referred to her as \"a thing ugly and petticoated\" (although his real complaint was her arguing theology with him). Her next novel \"The Victim of Prejudice\" (1799) is more emphatically feminist in its focus on women's secondary status and criticism of class hierarchies. Hays was considered too radical and her book did not sell well. In 1803 Hays demonstrated her continuing concern with women's lives and work, publishing \"Female Biography\", a book in six volumes, containing the lives of 294 women from ancient figures to near contemporaries. Some scholars have argued that by this stage Hays realised that it was dangerous to praise Mary Wollstonecraft, and so omitted her from the book. Others have argued that Hays had little to lose and did not include Wollstonecraft for other reasons—her stated reason that she was too recently dead, and because she had already written and published a full obituary that should perhaps be considered part of \"Female Biography\".\n\nMoving to Camberwell in 1804 thanks to the income from \"Female Biography\", Hays became known to more literary figures of the time, including Charles and Mary Lamb and William Blake. The last 20 years of her life were difficult, with little income and only moderate praise for her work. During this period, she published \"Memoirs of Queens, Illustrious and Celebrated \" (1821). In 1824 Hays returned to London where she died in 1843. She is buried at Abney Park Cemetery, Church Street, Stoke Newington, London.\n\nMary Hays is memorialised in the Heritage Floor of Judy Chicago's \"The Dinner Party\", near the place setting for Mary Wollstonecraft. Her letters are held at the New York Public Library, Astor and Tilden Foundation thanks to the work of Dr. Gina Luria Walker.\n\nAll by Mary Hays; dates are for first editions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25365210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25365210", "title": "Measuring economic worth over time", "text": "Measuring economic worth over time\n\nThe measurement of economic worth over time is the problem of relating past prices, costs, values and proportions of social production to current ones. For a number of reasons, relating any past indicator to a current indicator of worth is theoretically and practically difficult for economists, historians, and political economists. This has led to some questioning of the idea of time series of worth having any meaning. However, the popular demand for measurements of social worth over time have caused the production of a number of series.\n\nPeople often seek a comparison between the price of an item in the past, and the price of an item today. Over short periods of time, like months, inflation may measure the role an object and its cost played in an economy: the price of fuel may rise or fall over a month. The price of money itself changes over time, as does the availability of goods and services as they move into or out of production. What people choose to consume changes over time. Finally, concepts such as cash money economies may not exist in past periods, nor ideas like wage labour or capital investment. Comparing what someone paid for a good, how much they had to work for that money, what the money was worth, how scarce a particular good was, what role it played in someone's standard of living, what its proportion was as part of social income, and what proportion it was as part of possible social production is a difficult task. This task is made more difficult by conflicting theoretical concepts of worth.\n\nOne chief problem is the competition between different fundamental conceptions of the division of social product into measurable or theorisable concepts. Marxist and political economic value, neoclassical marginalist, and other ideas regarding proportion of social product not measured in money terms have arisen.\n\nOfficial measures by governments have a limited depth of the time series, mainly originating in the 20th century. Even within these series, changes in parameters such as consumption bundles, or measures of GDP fundamentally affect the worth of a series.\n\nHistorical series computed from statistical data sets, or estimated from archival records have a number of other problems, including changing consumption bundles, consumption bundles not representing standard measures, and changes to the structure of social worth itself such as the move to wage labour and market economies.\n\nA different time series should be used depending on what kind of economic object is being compared over time:\n\n\n\nA wage price series is a set of data claiming to indicate the real wages and real prices of goods over a span of time, and their relationship to each other through the price of money at the time they were compared. Wage price series are currently collected and computed by major governments. Wage price series are also computed historically by economic historians and non-government organisations. Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working-class people.\n\nContemporary wage price series are the result of the normal operation of government economic statistics units, and are often produced as part of the National income accounts.\n\nComputing a historical wage price series requires discovering government or non government data, determining if the measures of wage or price are appropriate, and then manipulating the data. Some of these series have been criticised for failing to deal with a number of significant data and theoretical problems.\n\nDue to the survival of literary records of economic life from the 13th century in the South of England, extensive attempts have been made to produce long run wage price series regarding Southern England, England in General, or the United Kingdom in the British Isles. Officer's production of a series from 1264 is reliant on a number of assumptions which he readily admits produce questions about his series' representation of reality. Officer is reliant on subseries compiled using different criteria, and these series are reliant upon primary sources that describe different earnings and expenses bundles. The assumption of universal wage labour and a retail goods market, the assumption of money rents, the inability to compute non-market earnings such as obligatory benefits received from masters or the right to squat, all impact on the quality and representative nature of Officer's sources and series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1630383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1630383", "title": "Moken", "text": "Moken\n\nThe Moken (also Mawken or Morgan; ; ) are an Austronesian people of the Mergui Archipelago, a group of approximately 800 islands claimed by both Burma and Thailand. Most of the 2,000 to 3,000 Moken live a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle heavily based on the sea, though this is increasingly under threat.\n\nThe Moken identify in a common culture, and speak the Moken language, a distinct Austronesian language. Attempts by both Burma and Thailand to assimilate the Moken into the wider regional culture have met with very limited success. However, the Moken face an uncertain future as their population decreases and their nomadic lifestyle and unsettled legal status leaves them marginalized by modern property and immigration laws, maritime conservation and development programs, and tightening border policies.\n\nThe people refer to themselves as Moken. The name is used for all of the Austronesian speaking tribes who inhabit the coast and islands in the Andaman Sea on the west coast of Thailand, the provinces of Satun, Trang, Krabi, Phuket, Phang Nga, and Ranong, up through the Mergui Archipelago of Myanmar. The group includes the Moken proper, the Moklen (Moklem), the Orang Sireh (Betel-leaf People), and the Orang Lanta. The last, the Orang Lanta, are a hybridized group formed when the Malay people settled the Lanta islands where the proto-Malay Orang Sireh had been living.\n\nThe Burmese call the Moken \"selung\", \"salone\", or \"chalome\". In Thailand they are called \"chao le\" (\"people of the sea\") or \"chao nam\" (\"people of the water\"), although these terms are also used loosely to include the Urak Lawoi and even the Orang Laut. In Thailand, acculturated Moken are called \"Thai mai\" (\"new Thais\").\n\nThe Moken are also called sea gypsies, a generic term that applies to a number of peoples in Southeast Asia. The Urak Lawoi are sometimes classified with the Moken, but they are linguistically and ethnologically distinct, being much more closely related to the Malay people.\n\nTheir knowledge of the sea enables them to live off its fauna and flora by using simple tools such as nets and spears to forage for food. What is not consumed is dried atop their boats, then used to barter for other necessities at local markets. During the monsoon season, they build additional boats while occupying temporary huts.\n\nMoken children have been found to see better than European children underwater due to constriction of their pupils and accommodation of their visual focus. Whether these differences are due to conditioning from frequent diving or genetic differences possibly arising from selection was not investigated. Members of another \"sea gypsy\" group, the Sama-Bajau, appear to have a number of genetic adaptations to facilitate a lifestyle involving extensive freediving.\n\nSome of the Burmese Moken are still nomadic people who roam the sea most of their lives in small hand-crafted wooden boats called \"kabang,\" which serve not just as transportation, but also as kitchen, bedroom, and living area. However, much of their traditional life, which is built on the premise of life as outsiders, is under threat.\n\nAside from ancestor worship, the Moken have no religion.\n\nThe Burmese and Thai governments have made attempts at assimilating the people into their own culture, but these efforts have met with limited success. Thai Moken have been permanently settled in villages located in the Surin Islands (Mu Ko Surin National Park), in Phuket Province, on the northwestern coast of Phuket Island, and on the nearby Phi Phi Islands of Krabi Province.\n\nThe Andaman Sea off the Tenasserim coast was the subject of keen scrutiny from Burma's regime during the 1990s due to offshore petroleum discoveries by multinational corporations including Unocal, Petronas and others. Reports from the late-1990s told of forced relocation by Burma's military regime of the sea gypsies to mainland sites. It was claimed most of the Salone had been relocated by 1997, which is consistent with a pervasive pattern of forced relocation of suspect ethnic, economic and political groups, conducted throughout Burma during the 1990s.\n\nIn Thailand, the Moken have been the target of land grabs by developers contesting their ownership of ancestral lands. Although sea gypsies have resided in Thailand's Andaman coastal provinces for several centuries, they have historically neglected to register official ownership of the land due to their ignorance of legal protocol.\n\nThe islands the Moken inhabit received much media attention in 2005 during the recovery from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. As they are keenly attuned to the ocean, the Moken in some areas knew the tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004 was coming and managed to preserve many lives. However, in the coastal villages of Phang Nga Province, like Tap Tawan, the Moken suffered severe devastation to housing and fishing boats in common with other Moken communities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19262812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19262812", "title": "Nisei", "text": "Nisei\n\nAlthough the earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants left Japan centuries ago, and a later group settled in Mexico in 1897, the four largest populations of Japanese immigrants and their descendants live in Brazil, Canada, Peru, and the United States.\n\nSome US \"Nisei\" were born after the end of World War II during the baby boom. Most \"Nisei\", however, who were living in the western United States during World War II, were forcibly interned with their parents (\"Issei\") after Executive Order 9066 was promulgated to exclude everyone of Japanese descent from large parts of the Western states. It has been argued that some \"Nisei\" feel caught in a dilemma between their Nisei parents and other Americans. The Nisei of Hawaii had a somewhat different experience.\n\nIn the United States, two representative \"Nisei\" were Daniel Inouye and Fred Korematsu. Hawaiian-born was one of many young Nisei men who volunteered to fight in the nation's military when restrictions against Japanese-American enlistment were removed in 1943. Inouye later went on to become a U.S. Senator from Hawaii after it achieved statehood.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Japanese Americans had reacted to the internment by acquiescing to the government's order, hoping to prove their loyalty as Americans. To them, Korematsu's opposition was treacherous to both his country and his community. Across the span of decades, he was seen as a traitor, a test case, an embarrassment and, finally, a hero.\n\nBrazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan, estimated to number more than 1.5 million (including those of mixed-race or mixed-ethnicity), more than that of the 1.2 million in the United States. The \"Nisei\" Japanese Brazilians are an important part of the ethnic minority in that South American nation.\n\nWithin Japanese-Canadian communities across Canada, three distinct subgroups developed, each with different sociocultural referents, generational identity, and wartime experiences.\n\nAmong the approximately 80,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, the \"Nisei\" Japanese Peruvians comprise the largest element. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori was the \"Nisei\" son of \"Issei\" emigrants from Kumamoto, Japan.\n\nJapanese Americans and Japanese Canadians have special names for each of their generations in North America. These are formed by combining one of the Japanese numbers corresponding to the generation with the Japanese word for generation (\"sei\" 世). The Japanese-American and Japanese-Canadian communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like \"Issei\", \"Nisei,\" and \"Sansei\" which describe the first, second and third generation of immigrants. The fourth generation is called \"Yonsei\" (四世) and the fifth is called \"Gosei\" (五世). The \"Issei,\" \"Nisei\" and \"Sansei\" generations reflect distinctly different attitudes to authority, gender, non-Japanese involvement, and religious belief and practice, and other matters. The age when individuals faced the wartime evacuation and internment is the single, most significant factor which explains these variations in their experiences, attitudes and behaviour patterns.\n\nThe term \"Nikkei\" (日系) was coined by a multinational group of sociologists and encompasses all of the world's Japanese immigrants across generations. The collective memory of the \"Issei\" and older \"Nisei\" was an image of Meiji Japan from 1870 through 1911, which contrasted sharply with the Japan that newer immigrants had more recently left. These differing attitudes, social values and associations with Japan were often incompatible with each other. In this context, the significant differences in post-war experiences and opportunities did nothing to mitigate the gaps which separated generational perspectives.\n\nIn North America since the redress victory in 1988, a significant evolutionary change has occurred. The Nisei, their parents and their children are changing the way they look at themselves as individuals of Japanese descent in their respective nations of Canada, the United States and Mexico.\n\nThere are currently just over one hundred thousand British Japanese, mostly in London; but unlike other \"Nikkei terms used centered from Japan to distinguish the distance from Japanese nationality elsewhere in the world, these Britons do not conventionally parse their communities in generational terms as \"Issei,\" \"Nisei,\" or \"Sansei.\"\n\nThe second generation of immigrants, born in Canada or the United States to parents not born in Canada or the United States, is called \"Nisei\" (二世). The \"Nisei\" have become part of the general immigrant experience in the United States and Canada to become part of the greater \"melting pot\" of Americans and Canadians. Some \"Nisei\" have resisted being absorbed into the majority society, largely because of their tendency to maintain Japanese interpersonal styles of relationships. -- \n\nMost \"Nisei\" were educated in Canadian or American school systems where they were taught Canadian or American national values as national citizens of those countries of individualism and citizenship. When these were taken away in the early 1940s, the \"Nisei\" confronted great difficulty in accepting or coming to terms with internment and forced resettlement. Older \"Nisei\" tended to identify more closely with the \"Issei,\" sharing similar economic and social characteristics. Older \"Nisei\" who had been employed in small businesses, in farming, in fishing or in semi-skilled occupations, tended to remain in blue-collar work. In contrast, the younger \"Nisei\" attended university and college and entered various professions and white-collar employment after the war. This sharp division in post-war experiences and opportunities exacerbated the gaps between these \"Nisei.\"\n\nThe \"kanreki\" (還暦), a traditional, pre-modern Japanese rite of passage to old age at 60, was sometimes celebrated by the \"Issei\" and is now being celebrated by increasing numbers of \"Nisei.\" Rituals are enactments of shared meanings, norms, and values; and this Japanese rite of passage highlights a collective response among the Nisei to the conventional dilemmas of growing older.\nAging is affecting the demographics of the Nisei. According to a 2011 columnist in \"The Rafu Shimpo\" of Los Angeles, the obituaries showing the number of Japanese Americans in their 80s and 90s — Nisei, in a word — who are passing is staggering\"\n\nThe Japanese-born \"Issei\" learned Japanese as their mother tongue, and their success in learning English as a second language was varied. Most \"Nisei\" speak Japanese to some extent, learned from \"Issei\" parents, Japanese school, and living in a Japanese community or in the internment camps. A majority of English-speaking \"Nisei\" have retained knowledge of the Japanese language, at least in its spoken form. Most \"Sansei\" speak English as their first language and most marry people of non-Japanese ancestry.\n\nAn illustrative point-of-view, as revealed in the poetry of an \"Issei\" woman:\n\nThere was relatively little inter-marriage during the Nisei generation, mainly because the relocation and the war intervened\nexactly at a time when the group was of marrying age. Identification of them with the enemy by the American public, made them\nunpopular and unlikely candidates for inter-racial marriage. Beside this, they were thrown, en masse, into camps with others of\nthe same ethnicity, causing the majority of Nisei to marry other Nisei. This is why third generation Sansei are mostly still of\nthe same racial appearance as the Issei, who first immigrated to the U.S. \nThe Sansei generation has widely inter-married in the post WWII years, with estimates of such unions at over 60 percent.\n\nWhen the Canadian and American governments interned West Coast Japanese in 1942, neither distinguished between those who were citizens (\"Nisei\") and their non-citizen parents (\"Issei\").\n\nIn 1978, the Japanese American Citizens League actively began demanding be taken as redress for harms endured by Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nIn 1980, Congress established the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) The commission report, \"Personal Justice Denied,\" condemned the internment as \"unjust and motivated by racism rather than real military necessity\".\n\nIn 1988, U.S. President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided for a formal apology and payments of $20,000 for each survivor. The legislation stated that government actions were based on \"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\". The Civil Liberties Act Amendments of 1992, appropriating an additional $400 million in order to ensure that all remaining internees received their $20,000 redress payments, was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush, who also issued another formal apology from the U.S. government.\n\nJapanese and Japanese Americans who were relocated during WWII were compensated for direct property losses in 1948. These payments were awarded to 82,210 Japanese Americans or their heirs at a cost of $1.6 billion; the program's final disbursement occurred in 1999.\n\nIn 1983, the National Association of Japanese Canadians (NAJC) mounted a campaign demanding redress for injustices during the war years. NAJC hired Price Waterhouse to estimate the economic losses to Japanese Canadians resulting from property confiscations and loss of wages due to internment. On the basis of detailed records maintained by the Custodian of Alien Property, it was determined that the total loss totalled $443 million (in 1986 dollars).\n\nIn 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gave that long-awaited formal apology and the Canadian government began to make good on a compensation package—including $21,000 to all surviving internees, and the re-instatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan.\n\nThe number of \"nisei\" who have earned some degree of public recognition has continued to increase over time; but the quiet lives of those whose names are known only to family and friends are no less important in understanding the broader narrative of the \"nikkei.\" Although the names highlighted here are over-represented by \"issei\" from North America, the Latin American member countries of the Pan American Nikkei Association (PANA) include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay, in addition to the English-speaking United States and Canada.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "461026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=461026", "title": "Ordination of women", "text": "Ordination of women\n\nThe ordination of women to ministerial or priestly office is an increasingly common practice among some major religious groups of the present time, as it was of several pagan religions of antiquity and, some scholars argue, in early Christian practice.\n\nIt remains a controversial issue in certain Christian denominations where \"ordination\" (the process by which a person is understood to be consecrated and set apart by God for the administration of various religious rites) has for almost 2,000 years been limited only to men.\n\nIn some cases women have been permitted to be ordained, but not to hold higher positions, such as (until July 2014) that of bishop in the Church of England. Where laws prohibit sex discrimination in employment, exceptions are often made for clergy (for example, in the United States).\n\n\nIn Ancient Egyptian religion, God's Wife of Amun was the highest ranking priestess; this title was held by a daughter of the High Priest of Amun, during the reign of Hatshepsut, while the capital of Egypt was in Thebes during the second millennium BC (circa 2160 BC).\n\nLater, Divine Adoratrice of Amun was a title created for the chief priestess of Amun. During the first millennium BC, when the holder of this office exercised her largest measure of influence, her position was an important appointment facilitating the transfer of power from one pharaoh to the next, when his daughter was \"adopted\" to fill it by the incumbent office holder. The Divine Adoratrice ruled over the extensive temple duties and domains, controlling a significant part of the ancient Egyptian economy.\n\nAncient Egyptian priestesses:\n\nIn ancient Greek religion, some important observances, such as the Thesmophoria, were made by women. Priestesses played a major role in the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Gerarai were priestesses of Dionysus who presided over festivals and rituals associated with the god. A body of priestesses might also maintain the cult at a particular holy site, such as the Peleiades at the oracle of Dodona. The \"Arrephoroi\" were young girls ages seven to twelve who worked as servants of Athena Polias on the Athenian Acropolis and were charged with conducting unique rituals.\n\nAt several sites women priestesses served as oracles , the most famous of which is the Oracle of Delphi. The priestess of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi was the Pythia, credited throughout the Greco-Roman world for her prophecies, which gave her a prominence unusual for a woman in male-dominated ancient Greece. The Phrygian Sibyl presided over an oracle of Apollo in Anatolian Phrygia. The inspired speech of divining women, however, was interpreted by male priests; a woman might be a mantic \"(mantis)\" who became the mouthpiece of a deity through possession, but the \"prophecy of interpretation\" required specialized knowledge and was considered a rational process suited only to a male '\"prophet\" \"(prophētēs)\".\n\nThe Latin word \"sacerdos\", \"priest,\" is the same for both the grammatical genders. In Roman state religion, the priesthood of the Vestals was responsible for the continuance and security of Rome as embodied by the sacred fire that they could not allow to go out. The Vestals were a college of six \"sacerdotes\" (plural) devoted to Vesta, goddess of the hearth, both the focus of a private home \"(domus)\" and the state hearth that was the center of communal religion. Freed of the usual social obligations to marry and rear children, the Vestals took a vow of chastity in order to devote themselves to the study and correct observance of state rituals that were off-limits to the male colleges of priests. They retained their religious authority until the Christian emperor Gratian confiscated their revenues and his successor Theodosius I closed the Temple of Vesta permanently.\n\nThe Romans also had at least two priesthoods that were each held jointly by a married couple, the \"rex\" and \"regina sacrorum\", and the \"flamen\" and \"flaminica Dialis\". The \"regina sacrorum\" (\"queen of the sacred rites\") and the \"flaminica Dialis\" (high priestess of Jupiter) each had her own distinct duties and presided over public sacrifices, the \"regina\" on the first day of every month, and the \"flaminica\" every nundinal cycle (the Roman equivalent of a week). The highly public nature of these sacrifices, like the role of the Vestals, indicates that women's religious activities in ancient Rome were not restricted to the private or domestic sphere. So essential was the gender complement to these priesthoods that if the wife died, the husband had to give up his office. This is true of the flaminate, and probably true of the \"rex\" and \"regina\".\n\nThe title \"sacerdos\" was often specified in relation to a deity or temple, such as a \"sacerdos Cereris\" or \"Cerealis\", \"priestess of Ceres\", an office never held by men. Female \"sacerdotes\" played a leading role in the sanctuaries of Ceres and Proserpina in Rome and throughout Italy that observed so-called \"Greek rite\" \"(ritus graecus)\". This form of worship had spread from Sicily under Greek influence, and the Aventine cult of Ceres in Rome was headed by male priests. Only women celebrated the rites of the Bona Dea (\"Good Goddess\"), for whom \"sacerdotes\" are recorded.\nFrom the Mid Republic onward, religious diversity became increasingly characteristic of the city of Rome. Many religions that were not part of Rome's earliest state religion offered leadership roles as priests for women, among them the imported cult of Isis and of the \"Magna Mater\" (\"Great Mother\", or Cybele). An epitaph preserves the title \"sacerdos maxima\" for a woman who held the highest priesthood of the Magna Mater's temple near the current site of St. Peter's Basilica. Inscriptions for the Imperial era record priestesses of Juno Populona and of deified women of the Imperial household.\n\nUnder some circumstances, when cults such as mystery religions were introduced to Romans, it was preferred that they be maintained by women. Although it was Roman practice to incorporate other religions instead of trying to eradicate them, the secrecy of some mystery cults was regarded with suspicion. In 189 BCE, the senate attempted to suppress the Bacchanals, claiming the secret rites corrupted morality and were a hotbed of political conspiracy. One provision of the senatorial decree was that only women should serve as priests of the Dionysian religion, perhaps to guard against the politicizing of the cult, since even Roman women who were citizens lacked the right to vote or hold political office. Priestesses of Liber, the Roman god identified with Dionysus, are mentioned by the 1st-century BC scholar Varro, as well as indicated by epigraphic evidence.\n\nOther religious titles for Roman women include \"magistra\", a high priestess, female expert or teacher; and \"ministra\", a female assistant, particularly one in service to a deity. A \"magistra\" or \"ministra\" would have been responsible for the regular maintenance of a cult. Epitaphs provide the main evidence for these priesthoods, and the woman is often not identified in terms of her marital status.\n\nGargi Vachaknavi is one of the earliest known woman sage from the Vedic period. Gargi composed several hymns that questioned the origin of all existence. She is mentioned in the Sixth and the Eighth Brahmana of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, where the \"brahmayajna\", a philosophic congress organized by King Janaka of Videha is described, she challenged the sage Yajnavalkya with perturbing questions on the \"atman\" (soul).\n\nBhairavi Brahmani is a guru of Sri Ramakrishna. She initiated Ramakrishna into Tantra. Under her guidance, Ramakrishna went through sixty four major tantric sadhanas which were completed in 1863.\n\nIn 2014 an all-female akhada (group of sadhus) was formed; it is believed to be the first such group in India.\n\nRamakrishna Sarada Mission is the modern 21st century monastic order for women. The order was conducted under the guidance of the Ramakrishna monks until 1959, at which time it became entirely independent. It currently has centers in various parts of India, and also in Sydney, Australia.\n\nThere are two types of Hindu priests, purohits and pujaris. Both women and men are ordained as purohits and pujaris. Chanda Vyas, born in Kenya, was Britain's first female Hindu priest.\n\nFurthermore, both men and women are Hindu gurus. Shakti Durga, formerly known as Kim Fraser, was Australia's first female guru.\n\nThe tradition of the ordained monastic community in Buddhism (the sangha) began with the Buddha, who established an order of monks. According to the scriptures, later, after an initial reluctance, he also established an order of nuns. Fully ordained Buddhist nuns are called bhikkhunis. Mahapajapati Gotami, the aunt and foster mother of Buddha, was the first bhikkhuni; she was ordained in the sixth century B.C.E.\n\nPrajñādhara is the twenty-seventh Indian Patriarch of Zen Buddhism and is believed to have been a woman.\n\nIn the Mahayana tradition during the 13th century, the Japanese Mugai Nyodai became the first female abbess and thus the first ordained female Zen master.\n\nHowever, the bhikkhuni ordination once existing in the countries where Theravada is more widespread died out around the 10th century, and novice ordination has also disappeared in those countries. Therefore, women who wish to live as nuns in those countries must do so by taking eight or ten precepts. Neither laywomen nor formally ordained, these women do not receive the recognition, education, financial support or status enjoyed by Buddhist men in their countries. These \"precept-holders\" live in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and Thailand. In particular, the governing council of Burmese Buddhism has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. However, in 2003, Saccavadi and Gunasari were ordained as bhikkhunis in Sri Lanka, thus becoming the first female Burmese novices in modern times to receive higher ordination in Sri Lanka. Japan is a special case as, although it has neither the bhikkhuni nor novice ordinations, the precept-holding nuns who live there do enjoy a higher status and better education than their precept-holder sisters elsewhere, and can even become Zen priests. In Tibet there is currently no bhikkhuni ordination, but the Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.\n\nThe bhikkhuni ordination of Buddhist nuns has always been practiced in East Asia. In 1996, through the efforts of Sakyadhita, an International Buddhist Women Association, ten Sri Lankan women were ordained as bhikkhunis in Sarnath, India. Also, bhikkhuni ordination of Buddhist nuns began again in Sri Lanka in 1998 after a lapse of 900 years. In 2003 Ayya Sudhamma became the first American-born woman to receive bhikkhuni ordination in Sri Lanka.\nFurthermore, on February 28, 2003, Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, formerly known as Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, became the first Thai woman to receive bhikkhuni ordination as a Theravada nun (Theravada is a school of Buddhism).\nDhammananda Bhikkhuni was ordained in Sri Lanka. Dhammananda Bhikkhuni's mother Venerable Voramai, also called Ta Tao Fa Tzu, had become the first fully ordained Thai woman in the Mahayana lineage in Taiwan in 1971.\n\nA 55-year-old Thai Buddhist 8-precept white-robed maechee nun, Varanggana Vanavichayen, became the first woman ordained as a monk in Thailand, in 2002. Since then, the Thai Senate has reviewed and revoked the secular law passed in 1928 banning women's full ordination in Buddhism as unconstitutional for being counter to laws protecting freedom of religion. However Thailand's two main Theravada Buddhist orders, the Mahanikaya and Dhammayutika Nikaya, have yet to officially accept fully ordained women into their ranks.\n\nIn 2009 in Australia four women received bhikkhuni ordination as Theravada nuns, the first time such ordination had occurred in Australia. It was performed in Perth, Australia, on 22 October 2009 at Bodhinyana Monastery. Abbess Vayama together with Venerables Nirodha, Seri, and Hasapanna were ordained as Bhikkhunis by a dual Sangha act of Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis in full accordance with the Pali Vinaya.\n\nIn 1997 Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun; when she received full ordination in 2000, her dwelling became America's first Theravada Buddhist bhikkhuni vihara. In 1998 Sherry Chayat, born in Brooklyn, became the first American woman to receive transmission in the Rinzai school of Buddhism. In 2006 Merle Kodo Boyd, born in Texas, became the first African-American woman ever to receive Dharma transmission in Zen Buddhism.\nAlso in 2006, for the first time in American history, a Buddhist ordination was held where an American woman (Sister Khanti-Khema) took the Samaneri (novice) vows with an American monk (Bhante Vimalaramsi) presiding. This was done for the Buddhist American Forest Tradition at the Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center in Missouri. In 2010 the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in America (Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont) was officially consecrated. It offers novice ordination and follows the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism. The abbot of the Vajra Dakini nunnery is Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, who is the first bhikkhuni in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, having been ordained in Taiwan in 2002. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, having been installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery in 2004. The Vajra Dakini Nunnery does not follow The Eight Garudhammas. Also in 2010, in Northern California, 4 novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai Theravada tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. Bhante Gunaratana and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere. The following month, more bhikkhuni ordinations were completed in Southern California, led by Walpola Piyananda and other monks and nuns. The bhikkhunis ordained in Southern California were Lakshapathiye Samadhi (born in Sri Lanka), Cariyapanna, Susila, Sammasati (all three born in Vietnam), and Uttamanyana (born in Myanmar).\n\nThe first bhikkhuni ordination in Germany, the Theravada bhikkhuni ordination of German nun Samaneri Dhira, occurred on June 21, 2015 at Anenja Vihara.\n\nThe first Theravada ordination of bhikkhunis in Indonesia after more than a thousand years occurred in 2015 at Wisma Kusalayani in Lembang, Bandung. Those ordained included Vajiradevi Sadhika Bhikkhuni from Indonesia, Medha Bhikkhuni from Sri Lanka, Anula Bhikkhuni from Japan, Santasukha Santamana Bhikkhuni from Vietnam, Sukhi Bhikkhuni and Sumangala Bhikkhuni from Malaysia, and Jenti Bhikkhuni from Australia.\n\nIn the liturgical traditions of Christianity, including the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, Lutheranism and Anglicanism, the term ordination refers more narrowly to the means by which a person is included in one of the orders of bishops, priests or deacons. This is distinguished from the process of consecration to religious orders, namely nuns and monks, which are open to women and men. Some Protestant denominations understand ordination more generally as the acceptance of a person for pastoral work.\n\nHistorians Gary Macy, Kevin Madigan and Carolyn Osiek claim to have identified documented instances of ordained women in the Early Church. Paul's letter to the Romans, written in the first century AD, mentions a woman deacon:\n\nIn AD 494, in response to reports that women were serving at the altar in the south of Italy, Pope Gelasius I wrote a letter condemning female participation in the celebration of the Eucharist, a role he felt was reserved for men.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation introduced the dogma that the authority of the Bible exceeds that of Popes and other church figures. Once the Roman Catholic hierarchy was no longer accepted as the sole authority, some denominations allowed women to preach. For example, George Fox founded the Quaker movement after discovering, in 1646, the \"inner light\" of Christ living in the believer. He believed that the inner light worked in women as well as in men, and said:\n\nThe ordination of women has once again been a controversial issue in more recent years with societal focus on social justice movements. Still, some Christians believe that, though men and women are equal, they are not identical and, since New Testament scripture outlays a division between roles of men and women in the church, it would be inappropriate to assign women the role or responsibilities of a pastor in a new testament church. For example, in reference to Anglicanism, some Anglo-Catholics or Evangelicals, while theologically very different, may share opposition to female ordination. Evangelical Christians who place emphasis on the infallibility of the Bible base their opposition to women's ordination partly upon the writings of the Apostle Paul, such as , and , which appears to demand male leadership in the Church. Traditionalist Roman and orthodox Catholics may allude to Jesus Christ's choice of disciples as evidence of his intention for an exclusively male apostolic succession, as laid down by early Christian writers such as Tertullian and reiterated in the 1976 \"Vatican Declaration on the Question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood\".\n\nSupporters of women's ordination may point to the role of notable female figures in the Bible such as Phoebe, Junia (considered an apostle by Paul) and others in , the female disciples of Jesus, and the women at the crucifixion who were the first witnesses to the Resurrection of Christ, as supporting evidence of the importance of women as leaders in the Early Church. They may also rely on exegetical interpretations of scriptural language related to gender.\n\nIn 1917 the Church of England licensed women as lay readers called bishop's messengers, many of whom ran churches, but did not go as far as to ordain them.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1978 the Anglican Group for the Ordination of Women to the Historic Ministry promoted the ordination of women in the Church of England.\n\nWithin Anglicanism the majority of provinces ordain women as deacons and priests.\n\nThe first three women ordained as priests in the Anglican Communion were in Hong Kong: Li Tim-Oi in 1944 and Jane Hwang and Joyce M. Bennett in 1971.\n\nOn July 29, 1974, Bishops Daniel Corrigan, Robert L. DeWitt, and Edward R. Welles of the US Episcopal Church, with Bishop Antonio Ramos of Costa Rica, ordained eleven women as priests in a ceremony that was widely considered \"irregular\" because the women lacked \"recommendation from the standing committee\", a canonical prerequisite for ordination. The \"Philadelphia Eleven\", as they became known, were Merrill Bittner, Alison Cheek, Alla Bozarth (Campell), Emily C. Hewitt, Carter Heyward, Suzanne R. Hiatt (d. 2002), Marie Moorefield, Jeannette Piccard (d. 1981), Betty Bone Schiess, Katrina Welles Swanson (d. 2006), and Nancy Hatch Wittig. Initially opposed by the House of Bishops, the ordinations received approval from the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in September 1976. This General Convention approved the ordination of women to both the priesthood and the episcopate.\n\nReacting to the action of the General Convention, clergy and laypersons opposed to the ordination of women to the priesthood met in convention at the Congress of St. Louis and attempted to form a rival Anglican church in the US and Canada. Despite the plans for a united North American church, the result was division into several Continuing Anglican churches, which now make up part of the Continuing Anglican movement.\n\nThe first woman to become a bishop in the Anglican Communion was Barbara Harris, who was elected a suffragan bishop in the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts in 1988 and ordained on February 11, 1989. The majority of Anglican provinces now permit the ordination of women as bishops, and as of 2014, women have served or are serving as bishops in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Ireland, South Africa, South India, Wales, and in the extra provincial Episcopal Church of Cuba. Libby Lane became the first woman consecrated a bishop of the Church of England in 2015. It had ordained 32 women as its first female priests in March 1994. In 2015 Rachel Treweek was consecrated as the first female diocesan bishop in the Church of England (Diocese of Gloucester). She and Sarah Mullally, Bishop of Crediton, were the first women to be consecrated and ordained bishop in Canterbury Cathedral. Also that year Treweek became the first woman to sit in the House of Lords as a Lord Spiritual, thus making her at the time the most senior ordained woman in the Church of England.\n\nOn June 18, 2006, the Episcopal Church became the first Anglican province to elect a woman, the Most Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, as a primate (leader of an Anglican province), called the \"Presiding Bishop\" in the United States.\n\nThe Community of Christ adopted the practice of women's ordination in 1984, which was one of the reasons for the schism between the Community of Christ and the newly formed Restoration Branches movement, which was largely composed of members of the Community of Christ church (then known as the RLDS church) who refused to accept this development and other doctrinal changes taking place during this same period. For example, the Community of Christ also changed the name of one of its priesthood offices from evangelist-patriarch to evangelist, and its associated sacrament, the patriarchal blessing, to the evangelist's blessing. In 1998, Gail E. Mengel and Linda L. Booth became the first two women apostles in the Community of Christ. At the 2007 World Conference of the church, Becky L. Savage was ordained as the first woman to serve in the First Presidency. In 2013, Linda L. Booth became the first woman elected to serve as president of the Council of Twelve.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses consider qualified public baptism to represent the baptizand's ordination, following which he or she is immediately considered an ordained minister. In 1941, the Supreme Court of Vermont recognized the validity of this ordination for a female Jehovah's Witness minister. The majority of Witnesses actively preaching from door to door are female. Women are commonly appointed as full-time ministers, either to evangelize as \"pioneers\" or missionaries, or to serve at their branch offices.\n\nNevertheless, Witness deacons (\"ministerial servants\") and elders must be male, and only a baptized adult male may perform a Jehovah's Witness baptism, funeral, or wedding. Within the congregation, a female Witness minister may only lead prayer and teaching when there is a special need, and must do so wearing a head covering.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints does not ordain women. Some (most notably former LDS members D. Michael Quinn and Margaret Toscano) have argued that the church ordained women in the past and that therefore the church currently has the power to ordain women and should do so; however, there are no known records of any women having been ordained to the priesthood. Women do hold a prominent place in the church, including their work in the Relief Society which is one of the largest and most long-lasting women's organizations in the world. Women thus serve, as do men, in unpaid positions involving teaching, administration, missionary service, humanitarian efforts, and other capacities. Women often offer prayers and deliver sermons during Sunday services. Ordain Women, an activist group of mostly Mormon women founded by feminist Kate Kelly in March 2013, supports extending priesthood ordinations to women.\n\nOf all the churches in the Liberal Catholic movement, only the original church, the Liberal Catholic Church under Bishop Graham Wale, does not ordain women. The position held by the Liberal Catholic Church is that the Church, even if it wanted to ordain women, does not have the authority to do so and that it would not be possible for a woman to become a priest even if she went through the ordination ceremony. The reasoning behind this belief is that the female body does not effectively channel the masculine energies of Christ, the true minister of all the sacraments. The priest has to be able to channel Christ's energies to validly confect the sacrament; therefore the sex of the priest is a central part of the ceremony hence all priests must be male. When discussing the sacrament of Holy Orders in his book \"Science of the Sacraments\". Second Presiding Bishop Leadbeater also opined that women could not be ordained; he noted that Christ left no indication that women can become priests and that only Christ can change this arrangement.\n\nThe Orthodox Church follows a line of reasoning similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church with respect to the ordination of bishops and priests, and does not allow women's ordination to those orders.\n\nThomas Hopko and Evangelos Theodorou have contended that female deacons were fully ordained in antiquity. K. K. Fitzgerald has followed and amplified Theodorou's research. Metropolitan Kallistos Ware wrote:\n\nOn October 8, 2004, the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece voted to permit the appointment of monastic deaconesses, that is, women to minister and assist at the liturgy within their own monasteries, but it made clear that the rite was a χειροτονία (appointment), not a χειροθεσία (ordination). There is a strong monastic tradition, pursued by both men and women in the Orthodox Church, where monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives. Unlike Latin Rite Catholic religious life, which has myriad traditions, both contemplative and active (see Benedictine and Cistercian monks, Dominican friars, Franciscan friars, Jesuits), that of Orthodoxy and the Christian East generally has remained exclusively ascetic and monastic, relying principally upon the early Syriac tradition, the Desert Fathers, and the Rule of Saint Benedict of Nursia.\n\nA key theological doctrine for Reformed and most other Protestants is the priesthood of all believers—a doctrine considered by them so important that it has been dubbed by some as \"a clarion truth of Scripture\".\n\nMost Protestant denominations require pastors, ministers, deacons, and elders to be formally ordained. The early Protestant reformer Martin Bucer, for instance, cited Ephesians 4 and other Pauline letters in support of this. While the process of ordination varies among the denominations and the specific church office to be held, it may require preparatory training such as seminary or Bible college, election by the congregation or appointment by a higher authority, and expectations of a lifestyle that requires a higher standard. For example, the \"Good News Translation\" of says, \"My friends, not many of you should become teachers. As you know, we teachers will be judged with greater strictness than others.\nUsually, these roles were male preserves. However, Quakers have ordained women from their founding in the mid-17th century. and women's ministry has been part of Methodist tradition in Britain for over 200 years. In the late 18th century in England, John Wesley allowed for female office-bearers and preachers. The Salvation Army has allowed the ordination of women since its beginning in 1865, although it was a hotly disputed topic between William and Catherine Booth. The fourth, thirteenth, and nineteenth Generals of the Salvation Army were women.\n\nMany Protestant denominations, such as the Free Will Baptists, are committed to congregational governance and reserve the power to ordain ministers to local congregations. Because of this, if there is no denomination-wide prohibition on ordaining women, congregations may do so while other congregations of the same denomination might not consider doing likewise. One notable female preacher of the Free Will Baptist denomination was Clarissa Danforth, who became the pastor of the Free Baptist in Burrillville in 1817, after the death of John Colby.\n\nOver the last century an increasing number of denominations have begun ordaining women. The Church of England appointed female lay readers during the First World War. Later the United Church of Canada in 1936 (Lydia Emelie Gruchy) and the American United Methodist Church in 1956 also began to ordain women. The first female Moderator of the United Church of Canada — a position open to both ministers and laypeople — was the Rev. Lois Miriam Wilson, who served 1980-1982.\n\nIn 1918, Alma Bridwell White, head of the Pillar of Fire Church, became the first woman to be ordained bishop in the United States.\n\nToday, over half of all American Protestant denominations ordain women, but some restrict the official positions a woman can hold. For instance, some ordain women for the military or hospital chaplaincy but prohibit them from serving in congregational roles. Over one-third of all seminary students (and in some seminaries nearly half) are female.\n\nThe Protestant denominations that refuse to ordain women often do so on the basis of New Testament scriptures that they interpret as prohibiting women from fulfilling church roles that require ordination. An especially important consideration here is the way is translated and interpreted in the New Testament. Debate on how to best interpret the 1 Timothy verse is intense and ongoing. Arguments regarding context and the Greek words have been used against the literal interpretation of some.\n\nThe Church of Denmark became the first Lutheran body to ordain women in 1948. Every body of Lutheranism is free to decide. Of the three major American synods, being the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS), and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), only the ELCA ordains women.\n\nThe teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, as emphasised by Pope John Paul II in the apostolic letter \"Ordinatio Sacerdotalis\", is \"that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgement is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful\".\nThis teaching is embodied in the current canon law 1024) and the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" (1992), by the canonical statement: \"Only a baptized man (Latin: \"vir\") validly receives sacred ordination.\" Insofar as priestly and episcopal ordination are concerned, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that this requirement is a matter of divine law; it belongs to the deposit of faith and is unchangeable.\n\nIn 2007, the Holy See issued a decree stating that attempted ordination of a woman would result in automatic excommunication for the women and bishops attempting to ordain them, and in 2010, that attempted ordination of women is a \"grave delict\".\n\nAn official Papal Commission ordered by Pope Francis in 2016 is charged with determining whether the ancient practice of having female deacons (deaconesses) is possible, provided they are non-ordained and that certain reserved functions of ordained male permanent or transitional deacons – proclaiming the Gospel at Mass, giving a homily, and performing non-emergency baptisms – would not be permitted for the discussed female diaconate.\n\nInspired by a mystically inclined nun, Feliksa Kozłowska, the Mariavite movement originally began as a response to the perceived corruption of the Roman Catholic Church in the Russian Partition of 19th century Poland. The Mariavites, so named for their devotion to the Virgin Mary, attracted numerous parishes across Mazovia and the region around Łódź and at their height numbered some 300,000 people. Fearing a schism, the established church authorities asked for intervention from the Vatican. The Mariavites were eventually excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1905 and 1906. Their clergy, cut loose from apostolic succession, found sanctuary with the Old Catholic Church and in 1909 the first Mariavite bishop, Michael Kowalski, was consecrated in Utrecht. Twenty years later, the now constituted Mariavite Church was riven by policy differences and a leadership struggle. Nevertheless, Archbishop Kowalski ordained the first 12 nuns as priests in 1929. He also introduced priestly marriage. The split in the church took effect, in part, over the place of the feminine in theology and the role of women in the life of the church. By 1935, Kowalski had introduced a \"universal priesthood\" that extended the priestly office to selected members of the laity. The two Mariavite churches survive to this day. The successors of Kowalski, who are known as the Catholic Mariavite Church and are based in the town of Felicjanów in the Płock region of Poland, are headed by a bishop who is a woman, although their numbers are dwarfed by the adherents of the more conventionally patriarchal Mariavites of Płock.\n\nVarious Catholics have written in favor of ordaining women. Dissenting groups advocating women's ordination in opposition to Catholic teaching include Women's Ordination Worldwide, Catholic Women's Ordination, Roman Catholic Womenpriests, and Women's Ordination Conference. Some cite the alleged ordination of Ludmila Javorová in Communist Czechoslovakia in 1970 by Bishop Felix Davídek (1921–88), himself clandestinely consecrated due to the shortage of priests caused by state persecution, as precedent. The Catholic Church treats attempted ordinations of women as invalid, and automatically excommunicates all participants.<ref name=\"http://www.catholicnewsagency.com\"></ref>\n\nFrom their founding in the mid-17th century, Quakers allowed women to preach. They believed that both genders are equally capable of inspiration by the Holy Spirit and thus there is a tradition of women preachers in Quaker Meetings from their earliest days. In order to be a preacher, a Friend had to obtain recognition by a Quaking Meeting. In the eighteenth century, ministers typically sat at the front of the meeting house, with women on one side and men on the other, all on the same raised platform.\n\nWomen ministers were active from the earliest days. In 1657, Mary Howgill, one of the Valiant Sixty (an early group of Quaker preachers), rebuked Oliver Cromwell for persecuting Quakers, saying, \"When thou givest account of all those actions, which have been acted by thee, ... as my soul lives, these things will be laid to thy charge.\" Later, in 1704, Esther Palmer of Flushing, Long Island, and Susanna Freeborn of Newport, Rhode Island, set out on a 3,230 mile journey across eight colonies of North America, including visits to preach in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.\n\nOther well-known Quaker women preachers were Mary Lawson of Philadelphia, Mary Bannister of London, England, Mary Ellerton of York, England, Rachel Wilson of Virginia, Catharine Payton of Pennsylvania, Ann Moore of New York, Susanna Hatton of Delaware, and Mary Dyer of Boston.\n\nAccording to its Working Policy the Seventh-day Adventist Church restricts certain positions of service and responsibility to those who have been ordained to the gospel ministry and the General Conference (GC) session, which is the highest decision-making body of the church, has never approved the ordination of women as ministers. Adventists have found no clear mandate or precedent for the practice of ordaining women in Scripture or in the writings of Ellen G. White. In recent years the ordination of women has been the subject of heated debate, especially in North America and Europe. In the Adventist church, candidates for ordination are recommended by local conferences (which usually administer about 50–150 local congregations) and approved by unions (which serve about 6–12 conferences). The church's Fundamental Beliefs and its worldwide practice as set forth in its Church Manual, including the worldwide qualifications for ordination currently restricted to men, can be revised only at the GC session.\n\nIn 1990 the GC session voted against a move to establish a worldwide policy permitting the ordination of women. In 1995 GC delegates voted not to authorize any of the 13 world divisions to establish policies for ordaining women within its territory. In 2011, the North American Division ignored the GC policy and without GC approval, voted to permit women to serve as conference presidents, a position requiring ordination. In early 2012, the GC responded to the NAD action with an analysis of church history and policy, demonstrating that divisions do not have the authority to establish policy different from GC policy. The NAD subsequently rescinded its action. But in their analysis the GC indicated that the \"final responsibility and authority\" for approving candidates for ordination resides at the union level. This led to decisions by several unions to approve ordinations without regard to gender.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, the North German Union voted to ordain women as ministers, but by late 2013 had not yet ordained a woman. On July 29, 2012, the Columbia Union Conference voted to \"authorize ordination without respect to gender\". On August 19, 2012, the Pacific Union Conference also voted to ordain without regard to gender. Both unions began immediately approving ordinations of women. By mid-2013, about 25 women had been ordained to the ministry in the Pacific Union Conference, plus several in the Columbia Union. On May 12, 2013, the Danish Union voted to treat men and women ministers the same, and to suspend all ordinations until after the topic is considered at the next GC session in 2015. On May 30, 2013, the Netherlands Union voted to ordain female pastors, recognizing them as equal to their male colleagues. On September 1, 2013, a woman was ordained in the Netherlands Union.\n\nIn 2012–2013 the General Conference established the Theology of Ordination Study Committee, which included representatives from each of its 13 world division biblical research committees, to study the issue and make a recommendation to be voted at the 2015 world GC session.\n\nOn October 27, 2013, Sandra Roberts became the first woman to lead a Seventh-day Adventist conference when she was elected president of the Southeastern California Conference. However, the world Seventh-day Adventist church does not recognize her election.\n\nAt the 60th General Conference Session in San Antonio on July 8, 2015, Seventh-day Adventists voted not to allow their regional church bodies to ordain women pastors. The President of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Ted N. C. Wilson, opened the morning session with an appeal for all church members to abide by the vote's outcome, and underscored both then and after the vote that decisions made by the General Conference in session carry the highest authority in the Adventist Church. By a margin of 1,381 to 977, with five abstentions, delegates by secret ballot ended a five-year study process characterized by open, vigorous and sometimes acrimonious debate.\n\nPrior to the GC vote, dozens of delegates voiced opinions for and against the question: \"After your prayerful study on ordination from the Bible, the writings of Ellen G. White, and the reports of the study commissions; and after your careful consideration of what is best for the church and the fulfillment of its mission, is it acceptable for division executive committees, as they may deem it appropriate in their territories, to make provision for the ordination of women to the gospel ministry?\"\n\nThe vote and discussion, which reflected decades long differences of opinion, came at a General Conference Session which is held to decide major issues.\n\nAs Protestant Christians who accept the Bible as their only rule of faith and practice, Seventh-day Adventists have been keen to resolve the issue based on Scripture (e.g. 1 Timothy 2:12 and Galatians 3:28).\n\nAlthough Muslims do not formally ordain religious leaders, the imam serves as a spiritual leader and religious authority. There is a current controversy among Muslims on the circumstances in which women may act as imams—that is, lead a congregation in salat (prayer). Three of the four Sunni schools, as well as many Shia, agree that a woman may lead a congregation consisting of women alone in prayer, although the Maliki school does not allow this. According to all currently existing traditional schools of Islam, a woman cannot lead a mixed gender congregation in salat (prayer). Some schools make exceptions for Tarawih (optional Ramadan prayers) or for a congregation consisting only of close relatives. Certain medieval scholars—including Al-Tabari (838–932), Abu Thawr (764–854), Al-Muzani (791–878), and Ibn Arabi (1165–1240)—considered the practice permissible at least for optional (nafila) prayers; however, their views are not accepted by any major surviving group. Islamic feminists have begun to protest this.\n\nWomen's mosques, called nusi, and female imams have existed since the 19th century in China and continue today.\n\nIn 1994, Amina Wadud, (an Islamic studies professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, born in the United States), became the first woman in South Africa to deliver the jum'ah khutbah (Friday sermon), which she did at the Claremont Main Road Mosque in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nIn 2004 20-year-old Maryam Mirza delivered the second half of the \"Eid al-Fitr\" khutbah at the Etobicoke mosque in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, run by the United Muslim Association.\n\nIn 2004, in Canada, Yasmin Shadeer led the night 'Isha prayer for a mixed-gender (men as well as women praying and hearing the sermon) congregation. This is the first recorded occasion in modern times where a woman led a congregation in prayer in a mosque.\n\nOn March 18, 2005, Amina Wadud gave a sermon and led Friday prayers for a Muslim congregation consisting of men as well as women, with no curtain dividing the men and women. Another woman, Suheyla El-Attar, sounded the call to prayer while not wearing a headscarf at that same event. This was done in the Synod House of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York after mosques refused to host the event. This was the first known time that a woman had led a mixed-gender Muslim congregation in prayer in American history.\n\nIn April 2005, Raheel Raza, born in Pakistan, led Toronto's first woman-led mixed-gender Friday prayer service, delivering the sermon and leading the prayers of the mixed-gender congregation organized by the Muslim Canadian Congress to celebrate Earth Day in the backyard of the downtown Toronto home of activist Tarek Fatah.\n\nOn July 1, 2005, Pamela Taylor, a Muslim convert since 1986, became the first woman to lead Friday prayers in a Canadian mosque, and did so for a congregation of both men and women. Pamela Taylor is an American convert to Islam and co-chair of the New York-based Progressive Muslim Union. In addition to leading the prayers, Taylor also gave a sermon on the importance of equality among people regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation and disability.\n\nIn October 2005, Amina Wadud led a mixed gender Muslim congregational prayer in Barcelona.\n\nIn 2008, Pamela Taylor gave the Friday \"khutbah\" and led the mixed-gender prayers in Toronto at the UMA mosque at the invitation of the Muslim Canadian Congress on Canada Day.<ref name=\"Source: 12/02/2008 4:30 pm\"></ref>\n\nOn 17 October 2008, Amina Wadud became the first woman to lead a mixed-gender Muslim congregation in prayer in the United Kingdom when she performed the Friday prayers at Oxford's Wolfson College.\n\nIn 2010, Raheel Raza became the first Muslim-born woman to lead a mixed-gender British congregation through Friday prayers.\n\nIn 2014, Afra Jalabi, a Syrian Canadian journalist and peace advocate delivered \"Eid ul-Adha\" khutbah at Noor cultural centre in Toronto, Canada.\n\nThere has been one female Hasidic rebbe, Hannah Rachel Verbermacher, also known as the Maiden of Ludmir, active in the 19th century. In 1935 Regina Jonas was ordained privately by a German rabbi and became the world's first female rabbi. Sally Priesand became the first female rabbi in Reform Judaism in 1972,\nSandy Eisenberg Sasso became the first female rabbi in Reconstructionist Judaism in 1974, Lynn Gottlieb became the first female rabbi in Jewish Renewal in 1981,\nAmy Eilberg became the first female rabbi in Conservative Judaism in 1985,\nand Tamara Kolton became the very first rabbi of either sex (and therefore, since she was female, the first female rabbi) in Humanistic Judaism in 1999. Women in Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist, Renewal, and Humanistic Judaism are routinely granted semicha (meaning ordination) on an equal basis with men. This version of semicha is not valid according to Orthodox Judaism and its interpretation of Jewish law.\n\nIn June 2009, Avi Weiss ordained Sara Hurwitz with the title \"maharat\" (an acronym of \"manhiga hilkhatit rukhanit Toranit\") rather than \"Rabbi\". In February 2010, Weiss announced that he was changing Maharat to a more familiar-sounding title \"Rabba\". The goal of this shift was to clarify Hurwitz's position as a full member of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale rabbinic staff. The change was criticised by both Agudath Yisrael and the Rabbinical Council of America, who called the move \"beyond the pale of Orthodox Judaism\". Weiss announced amidst criticism that the term \"Rabba\" would not be used anymore for his future students. Also in 2009, Weiss founded Yeshivat Maharat, a school which \"is dedicated to giving Orthodox women proficiency in learning and teaching Talmud, understanding Jewish law and its application to everyday life as well as the other tools necessary to be Jewish communal leaders.\" In 2015 Yaffa Epstein was ordained as Rabba by the Yeshivat Maharat. Also in 2015, Lila Kagedan was ordained as Rabbi by that same organization, making her their first graduate to take the title Rabbi. Hurwitz continues to use the title Rabba and is considered by some to be the first female Orthodox rabbi.\n\nHowever, in the fall of 2015 Rabbinical Council of America passed a resolution which states, \"RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution.\" Similarly in the fall of 2015 Agudath Israel of America denounced moves to ordain women, and went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Open Orthodoxy, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism.\n\nOnly men can become cantors (also called hazzans) in Orthodox Judaism, but all other types of Judaism allow and have female cantors. In 1955 Betty Robbins, born in Greece, became the world's first female cantor when she was appointed cantor of the Reform congregation of Temple Avodah in Oceanside, New York, in July.\nBarbara Ostfeld-Horowitz became the first female cantor to be ordained in Reform Judaism in 1975.\nErica Lippitz and Marla Rosenfeld Barugel became the first female cantors in Conservative Judaism in 1987.\nHowever, the Cantors Assembly, a professional organization of cantors associated with Conservative Judaism, did not allow women to join until 1990. In 2001 Deborah Davis became the first cantor of either sex (and therefore, since she was female, the first female cantor) in Humanistic Judaism, although Humanistic Judaism has since stopped graduating cantors. Sharon Hordes became the first cantor of either sex (and therefore, since she was female, the first female cantor) in Reconstructionist Judaism in 2002. Avitall Gerstetter, who lives in Germany, became the first female cantor in Jewish Renewal (and the first female cantor in Germany) in 2002. Susan Wehle became the first American female cantor in Jewish Renewal in 2006; however, she died in 2009. The first American women to be ordained as cantors in Jewish Renewal after Susan Wehle's ordination were Michal Rubin and Abbe Lyons, both ordained on January 10, 2010.\n\nThe indigenous religion of the Ryukyuan Islands in Japan is led by female priests; this makes it the only known official mainstream religion of a society led by women.\n\nIn Shintoism, \"Saiin\" (斎院, saiin?) were unmarried female relatives of the Japanese emperor who served as high priestesses at Ise Grand Shrine from the late 7th century until the 14th century. Ise Grand Shrine is a Shinto shrine dedicated to the goddess Amaterasu-ōmikami. \"Saiin\" priestesses were usually elected from royalty (内親王, \"naishinnō\") such as princesses (女王, \"joō\"). In principle, \"Saiin\" remained unmarried, but there were exceptions. Some \"Saiin\" became consorts of the Emperor, called Nyōgo in Japanese. According to the Man'yōshū (The Anthology of Ten Thousand Leaves), the first \"Saiō\" to serve at Ise Grand Shrine was Princess Ōku, daughter of Emperor Tenmu, during the Asuka period of Japanese history.\n\nThe ordination of women as Shinto priests arose again after the abolition of State Shinto in the aftermath of World War II. See also Miko.\n\nSikhism does not have priests, which were abolished by Guru Gobind Singh, as the guru had seen that institution become corrupt in society during his time. Instead, he appointed the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, as his successor as Guru instead of a possibly fallible human. Due to the faith's belief in complete equality, women can participate in any religious function, perform any Sikh ceremony or lead the congregation in prayer. A Sikh woman has the right to become a \"Granthi\", \"Ragi\", and one of the \"Panj Piare\" (5 beloved) and both men and women are considered capable of reaching the highest levels of spirituality.\n\nTaoists ordain both men and women as priests. In 2009 Wu Chengzhen became the first female \"fangzhang\" (principal abbot) in Taoism's 1,800-year history after being enthroned at Changchun Temple in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, in China. \"Fangzhang\" is the highest position in a Taoist temple.\n\nIn Wicca, as many women are ordained as men. Although, many traditions elevate the importance of women than men and are frequently leaders of the coven. Members are typically considered Priests and Priestesses when they are given the rite of Initiation within the coven, though some may choose to undergo additional training to become High Priestess who often has the final say in matters and who may choose who can be her High Priest. Some, who have gone through enough experience, may leave to create their own coven.\n\nThe Yoruba people of western Nigeria practice an indigenous religion with a religious hierarchy of priests and priestesses that dates to 800-1000 CE. Ifá Oracle priests and priestesses bear the titles \"Babalawo\" and \"Iyanifa\" respectively. Priests and priestesses of the varied \"Orisha\", when not already bearing the higher ranked oracular titles mentioned above, are referred to as \"babalorisa\" when male and \"iyalorisa\" when female. Initiates are also given an Orisa or Ifá name that signifies under which deity they are initiated; for example a priestess of Oshun may be named \"Osunyemi\" and a priest of \"Ifá\" may be named \"Ifáyemi\".\n\nZoroastrian priests in India are required to be male. However, women have been ordained in Iran and North America as mobedyars, meaning women mobeds (Zoroastrian priests). In 2011 the Tehran Mobeds Anjuman (Anjoman-e-Mobedan) announced that for the first time in the history of Iran and of the Zoroastrian communities worldwide, women had joined the group of mobeds (priests) in Iran as mobedyars (women priests); the women hold official certificates and can perform the lower-rung religious functions and can initiate people into the religion.\n\n"}

The singer met her managers Jamie Binns and Christian Wåhlberg in 2007. Her debut album, \"Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?\" was released in 2009 and has been certified double platinum in the UK. The album contains the singles \"Stone Cold Sober\", \"New York\" and \"Upside Down\", and earned Faith her first BRIT Award nomination in 2010. In 2012, Faith released her second studio album, \"Fall to Grace\", which debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. The album was critically well received and surpassed the success of her debut, earning her numerous award nominations in 2013 and earning a double platinum certification in the UK. The album produced her first top ten single, \"Picking Up the Pieces\", the top twenty cover version of INXS's \"Never Tear Us Apart\" and earned her two BRIT Award nominations for Best British Female and British Album of the Year. Faith released her third album, \"A Perfect Contradiction\" in 2014, which stands as her most successful album to date. The album spawned the two UK top ten singles \"Can't Rely on You\" and \"Only Love Can Hurt Like This\", with the latter topping the charts in Australia. Faith won Best British Female Solo Artist at the BRIT Awards in 2015. Her fourth studio album, \"The Architect\" was released in 2017, and debuted at number one in the UK, becoming Faith's first number one album.\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Faith has also collaborated with the duo Sigma on the 2012 track \"Changing\", which charted at number one in the UK, and DJ Sigala on \"Lullaby\" which reached the top ten in 2018. Furthermore, she has also made feature film appearances in \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\", \"Dread,\" the 2007 remake of \"St\" \"Trinian's\" and \"Youth\". In 2016, Faith appeared as a judge on the fifth series of \"The Voice UK\".\n\nFaith was born to an English mother and Spanish father in Hackney, although her parents were both from Norfolk. Her parents separated when she was two years old and divorced two years later. She was raised by her mother in Stoke Newington, although she has a close relationship with her paternal grandmother, a Spanish Roman Catholic. As a child, she was encouraged to dance by her mother and took weekly ballet classes in Dalston. After completing her A-levels at City and Islington College she went on to study for a degree in contemporary dance at the Northern School of Contemporary Dance in Leeds, working as a hip hop dancer at popular club LoveDough. She then studied for an MA in theatre directing at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, funding herself by working in various part-time jobs, including sales assistant at Agent Provocateur, singer in a burlesque cabaret, a bartender, a life model and a magician's assistant.\n\nFaith's first foray into music began when she mimicked famous soul and jazz singers including Etta James and Billie Holiday, whom she admired and cites as influences for her own work. She met her managers Jamie Binns and Christian Wåhlberg of Lateral Management in 2007. Binns had been tipped off by the producer Peanut, a client who had recently worked with her in his studio and been suitably impressed. He met up with Faith shortly afterwards and was \"completely blown away\", later saying: \"I wasn't sure what this girl was going to do – she was an actress and a singer – but there was just something about her in that artistic realness that when I came out of the meeting I called Christian and said, 'We have to do something with this girl!'\"\n\nDuring her time at college Faith worked in a pub where the manager Dr Vishaal Goel asked her to front his band, which they later called 'Paloma and the Penetrators'. During a performance with the band at a cabaret show, she was scouted by an A&R man from Epic Records, who invited her to sing for the manager of the label. Twenty minutes into the audition, she asked the manager to turn his phone off and when he refused, she walked out. The manager later called her and offered her a contract saying he had seen many acts since and none had been as memorable as her. She turned down an opportunity to join Amy Winehouse's band and began to write and perform her own songs. Her first recognised work was the song \"It's Christmas (and I Hate You)\", which she recorded as a duet with singer-songwriter Josh Weller in 2008.\n\nIn June 2009, Faith released her debut single \"Stone Cold Sober\", which reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart. Her second single, \"New York\", was released in September 2009, charting at number 15 in the UK. It was later re-released as an updated version featuring rapper Ghostface Killah. In September 2009, she released her debut album, \"Do You Want the Truth or Something Beautiful?\", for which she wrote or co-wrote all of the songs in the UK, Sweden and America. It debuted at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart and later peaked at number nine, remaining in the chart for 16 weeks. and becoming BBC Radio 2's 'Album of the Week' from 19 September 2009. She released her third single, the album's title track in December 2009. The song peaked at number 64 in the UK. In the same year, Faith appeared as a vocalist on Basement Jaxx's \"Scars\" album and American hip-hop artist MF Doom's album, \"Born Like This\". \n\nIn March 2010, Faith released her fourth single \"Upside Down\", which reached number 55 in the UK. To promote the album, she embarked on her first headlining tour of the UK and Ireland commencing in March. \"The Times\" described the tour as being \"full of theatrical artifice, but based on the rock-solid foundation of [Faith]'s sensational singing voice and a personality that sparkled like a rough diamond\". She performed a live set for the BBC's \"Radio 2 Introduces...\" and gave an interview to host Dermot O'Leary. Faith performed at numerous festivals throughout that summer, including T4 on the Beach, the Cheltenham Jazz Festival and the 2010 iTunes Festival. In May 2010, Faith featured on the theme song \"Keep Moving\" to the 2010 British film \"4.3.2.1\", alongside Adam Deacon and Bashy. In October 2010, Faith released the final single from her debut album \"Smoke & Mirrors\".\n\nIn January 2011, Faith was nominated for British Female Solo Artist at the 2011 BRIT Awards, where she also performed \"Forget You\" alongside Cee Lo Green. She appeared on the charity single \"Hard Times\" with Plan B and Elton John in May 2011. In May 2012, Faith released her second studio album \"Fall to Grace\". She enlisted record producers Nellee Hooper and Jake Gosling to work with her on the project. The album charted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. The album's first single \"Picking Up the Pieces\" reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Faith's first top ten single. In May 2012, Faith joined \"The Voice UK\" as one of four guest mentors. She worked with coach Danny O'Donoghue during the battle rounds phase of the competition and also performed \"Picking Up the Pieces\" during the results show. \n\nIn August 2012, Faith released \"30 Minute Love Affair\" as the second single from \"Fall to Grace\". She recorded a version of INXS's \"Never Tear Us Apart\" for a John Lewis advertisement, which began airing on television from September 2012. It was later included on the album as a single. Faith released \"Just Be\" as the fourth single from the album on in December 2012. She performed the track on \"Later... with Jools Holland\". In early 2013, Faith embarked on a headline UK and Ireland tour in support of the album. She received two nominations at the 2013 BRIT Awards; for Best Female and for Best British Album for \"Fall to Grace\". The album has been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 700,000 copies.\n\nIn January 2013, Faith revealed that she had begun to write her third studio album during her time in the US. Later that year, she headlined the Evolution Festival in Newcastle upon Tyne. In March 2014, Faith's third album \"A Perfect Contradiction\" was released. It became her fastest-selling album to date, debuting at number two in the UK and receiving a double platinum certification. The lead single \"Can't Rely on You\" produced by Pharrell Williams, became her second top ten in the UK. The album's second single \"Only Love Can Hurt Like This\", written by Diane Warren, became her most successful single to date, reaching number six in the UK, number one in Australia and number three in New Zealand. After the success of the single, the album reached a new peak of number four in Australia. The album's third single, \"Trouble with My Baby\" was released in August 2014.\n\nIn September 2014, British drum and bass duo \"Sigma\" released their single \"Changing\", featuring vocals from Faith. It debuted at number one in the UK, becoming her first UK number one single. In November 2014, a repackaged \"Outsider's Edition\" of her third album was released featuring four new songs including the single \"Ready for the Good Life\". The same month, Faith joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording a new version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa. At the 2015 Brit Awards, Faith won the award for British Female Solo Artist, becoming her first win.\n\nIn June 2015, Faith confirmed that she had started the process of creating her fourth studio album. She made reference to Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin as inspirations for the record. In August 2015, it was announced that Faith would become a coach on \"The Voice UK\". As well as her role on the show, Faith launched her own management and publishing company. In August 2016 it was revealed that she was expecting her first child with partner Leyman Lahcine, to which she gave birth to in December 2016.\n\nIn August 2017, Faith returned with the lead single \"Crybaby\" from her fourth album entitled \"The Architect\". The album was later released in November, debuting at number one on the UK Albums Chart, becoming Faith's first UK chart-topping album. Three further singles from the album have been released: \"Guilty\", \"'Til I'm Done\" and \"Warrior\". In February 2018, Faith released a collaboration with DJ Sigala, \"Lullaby\" which charted at number six in the UK, becoming her fourth top ten single as a lead artist and fifth overall. The following month, Faith covered the 1960s song \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\" by Mama Cass. It featured in a TV commercial by Škoda which was heavily played throughout the year, causing the track to chart at number 28 in the UK. In November 2018, Faith released a re-issue \"Zeitgeist Edition\" of \"The Architect\", featuring six new songs including \"Make Your Own Kind of Music\", \"Lullaby\" and \"Loyal\".\n\nIn 2007, Faith appeared in an episode of the BBC police drama \"HolbyBlue\" portraying a thief. She was also cast as Andrea in \"St Trinian's\" in 2007. Faith was also cast in Terry Gilliam's \"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus\" as Sally, the girlfriend of the Devil (played by Tom Waits) in 2009. She also appeared in the horror film \"Dread\" as Clara Thornhill. She later starred in the Channel 4 series \"Coming Up\" and the short film \"A Nice Touch\". Of getting the part, she stated \"I don't think they even knew I was an actress. I went to an audition and they said that they liked my interpretation of the character and I said, 'I'm just being myself'.\" In 2013, she appeared as cabaret performer Georgia, in a television adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse's \"Blandings\" (episode \"The Crime Wave at Blandings\") on the BBC. In 2015 she appeared as herself in Paolo Sorrentino's \"Youth\".\n\nIn 2015, Faith appeared as Tinker Bell in the TV film \"Peter & Wendy\", based on J. M.

{"id": "24872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24872", "title": "Pollution", "text": "Pollution\n\nPollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.\nIn 2015, pollution killed 9 million people in the world.\n\nMajor forms of pollution include: Air pollution, light pollution, littering, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, water pollution.\n\nAir pollution has always accompanied civilizations. Pollution started from prehistoric times, when man created the first fires. According to a 1983 article in the journal \"Science,\" \"soot\" found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires.\" Metal forging appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home. Core samples of glaciers in Greenland indicate increases in pollution associated with Greek, Roman, and Chinese metal production.\n\nThe burning of coal and wood, and the presence of many horses in concentrated areas made the cities the primary sources of pollution. The Industrial Revolution brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and wastes into local streams that served as the water supply. King Edward I of England banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in London in 1272, after its smoke became a problem; the fuel was so common in England that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.\n\nIt was the industrial revolution that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. London also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the Great Stink on the Thames of 1858, which led to construction of the London sewerage system soon afterward. Pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded viability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem. Reformers began to demand sewer systems and clean water.\n\nIn 1870, the sanitary conditions in Berlin were among the worst in Europe. August Bebel recalled conditions before a modern sewer system was built in the late 1870s:\n\nThe primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital, and the Imperial German government brought in its scientists, engineers, and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies, but to forge Berlin as the world's model city. A British expert in 1906 concluded that Berlin represented \"the most complete application of science, order and method of public life,\" adding \"it is a marvel of civic administration, the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is.\"\n\nThe emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal gave rise to unprecedented air pollution and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. Chicago and Cincinnati were the first two American cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881. Pollution became a major issue in the United States in the early twentieth century, as progressive reformers took issue with air pollution caused by coal burning, water pollution caused by bad sanitation, and street pollution caused by the 3 million horses who worked in American cities in 1900, generating large quantities of urine and manure. As historian Martin Melosi notes, The generation that first saw automobiles replacing the horses saw cars as \"miracles of cleanliness.\". By the 1940s, however, automobile-caused smog was a major issue in Los Angeles.\n\nOther cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century, when the short lived Office of Air Pollution was created under the Department of the Interior. Extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of Los Angeles and Donora, Pennsylvania in the late 1940s, serving as another public reminder.\n\nAir pollution would continue to be a problem in England, especially later during the industrial revolution, and extending into the recent past with the Great Smog of 1952. Awareness of atmospheric pollution spread widely after World War II, with fears triggered by reports of radioactive fallout from atomic warfare and testing. Then a non-nuclear event—the Great Smog of 1952 in London—killed at least 4000 people. This prompted some of the first major modern environmental legislation: the Clean Air Act of 1956.\n\nPollution began to draw major public attention in the United States between the mid-1950s and early 1970s, when Congress passed the Noise Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. \n\nSevere incidents of pollution helped increase consciousness. PCB dumping in the Hudson River resulted in a ban by the EPA on consumption of its fish in 1974. National news stories in the late 1970s—especially the long-term dioxin contamination at Love Canal starting in 1947 and uncontrolled dumping in Valley of the Drums—led to the Superfund legislation of 1980. The pollution of industrial land gave rise to the name brownfield, a term now common in city planning.\n\nThe development of nuclear science introduced radioactive contamination, which can remain lethally radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. Lake Karachay—named by the Worldwatch Institute as the \"most polluted spot\" on earth—served as a disposal site for the Soviet Union throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Chelyabinsk, Russia, is considered the \"Most polluted place on the planet\".\n\nNuclear weapons continued to be tested in the Cold War, especially in the earlier stages of their development. The toll on the worst-affected populations and the growth since then in understanding about the critical threat to human health posed by radioactivity has also been a prohibitive complication associated with nuclear power. Though extreme care is practiced in that industry, the potential for disaster suggested by incidents such as those at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl pose a lingering specter of public mistrust. Worldwide publicity has been intense on those disasters. Widespread support for test ban treaties has ended almost all nuclear testing in the atmosphere.\n\nInternational catastrophes such as the wreck of the Amoco Cadiz oil tanker off the coast of Brittany in 1978 and the Bhopal disaster in 1984 have demonstrated the universality of such events and the scale on which efforts to address them needed to engage. The borderless nature of atmosphere and oceans inevitably resulted in the implication of pollution on a planetary level with the issue of global warming. Most recently the term persistent organic pollutant (POP) has come to describe a group of chemicals such as PBDEs and PFCs among others. Though their effects remain somewhat less well understood owing to a lack of experimental data, they have been detected in various ecological habitats far removed from industrial activity such as the Arctic, demonstrating diffusion and bioaccumulation after only a relatively brief period of widespread use.\n\nA much more recently discovered problem is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a huge concentration of plastics, chemical sludge and other debris which has been collected into a large area of the Pacific Ocean by the North Pacific Gyre. This is a less well known pollution problem than the others described above, but nonetheless has multiple and serious consequences such as increasing wildlife mortality, the spread of invasive species and human ingestion of toxic chemicals. Organizations such as 5 Gyres have researched the pollution and, along with artists like Marina DeBris, are working toward publicizing the issue.\n\nPollution introduced by light at night is becoming a global problem, more severe in urban centres, but nonetheless contaminating also large territories, far away from towns.\n\nGrowing evidence of local and global pollution and an increasingly informed public over time have given rise to environmentalism and the environmental movement, which generally seek to limit human impact on the environment.\n\nThe major forms of pollution are listed below along with the particular contaminant relevant to each of them:\n\nA pollutant is a waste material that pollutes air, water, or soil. Three factors determine the severity of a pollutant: its chemical nature, the concentration and the persistence.\n\nPollution has a cost. Manufacturing activities that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs on the whole of society, whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own homes. A manufacturing activity that causes air pollution is an example of a negative externality in production. A negative externality in production occurs “when a firm’s production reduces the well-being of others who are not compensated by the firm.\" For example, if a laundry firm exists near a polluting steel manufacturing firm, there will be increased costs for the laundry firm because of the dirt and smoke produced by the steel manufacturing firm. If external costs exist, such as those created by pollution, the manufacturer will choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the manufacturer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of externalization is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in public safety, less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others. However, goods and services that involve negative externalities in production, such as those that produce pollution, tend to be over-produced and underpriced since the externality is not being priced into the market.\n\nPollution can also create costs for the firms producing the pollution. Sometimes firms choose, or are forced by regulation, to reduce the amount of pollution that they are producing. The associated costs of doing this are called abatement costs, or marginal abatement costs if measured by each additional unit. In 2005 pollution abatement capital expenditures and operating costs in the US amounted to nearly $27 billion.\n\nSociety derives some indirect utility from pollution, otherwise there would be no incentive to pollute. This utility comes from the consumption of goods and services that create pollution. Therefore, it is important that policymakers attempt to balance these indirect benefits with the costs of pollution in order to achieve an efficient outcome.\n\nIt is possible to use environmental economics to determine which level of pollution is deemed the social optimum. For economists, pollution is an “external cost and occurs only when one or more individuals suffer a loss of welfare,” however, there exists a socially optimal level of pollution at which welfare is maximized. This is because consumers derive utility from the good or service manufactured, which will outweigh the social cost of pollution until a certain point. At this point the damage of one extra unit of pollution to society, the marginal cost of pollution, is exactly equal to the marginal benefit of consuming one more unit of the good or service.\n\nIn markets with pollution, or other negative externalities in production, the free market equilibrium will not account for the costs of pollution on society. If the social costs of pollution are higher than the private costs incurred by the firm, then the true supply curve will be higher. The point at which the social marginal cost and market demand intersect gives the socially optimal level of pollution. At this point, the quantity will be lower and the price will be higher in comparison to the free market equilibrium. Therefore, the free market outcome could be considered a market failure because it “does not maximize efficiency”.\n\nThis model can be used as a basis to evaluate different methods of internalizing the externality. Some examples include tariffs, a carbon tax and cap and trade systems.\n\nAir pollution comes from both natural and human-made (anthropogenic) sources. However, globally human-made pollutants from combustion, construction, mining, agriculture and warfare are increasingly significant in the air pollution equation.\n\nMotor vehicle emissions are one of the leading causes of air pollution. China, United States, Russia, India Mexico, and Japan are the world leaders in air pollution emissions. Principal stationary pollution sources include chemical plants, coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, petrochemical plants, nuclear waste disposal activity, incinerators, large livestock farms (dairy cows, pigs, poultry, etc.), PVC factories, metals production factories, plastics factories, and other heavy industry. Agricultural air pollution comes from contemporary practices which include clear felling and burning of natural vegetation as well as spraying of pesticides and herbicides\n\nAbout 400 million metric tons of hazardous wastes are generated each year. The United States alone produces about 250 million metric tons. Americans constitute less than 5% of the world's population, but produce roughly 25% of the world’s , and generate approximately 30% of world’s waste. In 2007, China has overtaken the United States as the world's biggest producer of , while still far behind based on per capita pollution - ranked 78th among the world's nations.\nIn February 2007, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), representing the work of 2,500 scientists, economists, and policymakers from more than 120 countries, said that humans have been the primary cause of global warming since 1950. Humans have ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the consequences of global warming, a major climate report concluded. But to change the climate, the transition from fossil fuels like coal and oil needs to occur within decades, according to the final report this year from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nSome of the more common soil contaminants are chlorinated hydrocarbons (CFH), heavy metals (such as chromium, cadmium–found in rechargeable batteries, and lead–found in lead paint, aviation fuel and still in some countries, gasoline), MTBE, zinc, arsenic and benzene. In 2001 a series of press reports culminating in a book called \"Fateful Harvest\" unveiled a widespread practice of recycling industrial byproducts into fertilizer, resulting in the contamination of the soil with various metals. Ordinary municipal landfills are the source of many chemical substances entering the soil environment (and often groundwater), emanating from the wide variety of refuse accepted, especially substances illegally discarded there, or from pre-1970 landfills that may have been subject to little control in the U.S. or EU. There have also been some unusual releases of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, commonly called \"dioxins\" for simplicity, such as TCDD.\n\nPollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. For example, hurricanes often involve water contamination from sewage, and petrochemical spills from ruptured boats or automobiles. Larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal oil rigs or refineries are involved. Some sources of pollution, such as nuclear power plants or oil tankers, can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.\n\nIn the case of noise pollution the dominant source class is the motor vehicle, producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise worldwide.\n\nAdverse air quality can kill many organisms including humans. Ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, throat inflammation, chest pain, and congestion. Water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day, mostly due to contamination of drinking water by untreated sewage in developing countries. An estimated 500 million Indians have no access to a proper toilet, Over ten million people in India fell ill with waterborne illnesses in 2013, and 1,535 people died, most of them children. Nearly 500 million Chinese lack access to safe drinking water. A 2010 analysis estimated that 1.2 million people died prematurely each year in China because of air pollution. The high smog levels China has been facing for a long time can do damage to civilians bodies and generate different diseases The WHO estimated in 2007 that air pollution causes half a million deaths per year in India. Studies have estimated that the number of people killed annually in the United States could be over 50,000.\n\nOil spills can cause skin irritations and rashes. Noise pollution induces hearing loss, high blood pressure, stress, and sleep disturbance. Mercury has been linked to developmental deficits in children and neurologic symptoms. Older people are majorly exposed to diseases induced by air pollution. Those with heart or lung disorders are at additional risk. Children and infants are also at serious risk. Lead and other heavy metals have been shown to cause neurological problems. Chemical and radioactive substances can cause cancer and as well as birth defects.\n\nAn October 2017 study by the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health found that global pollution, specifically toxic air, water, soils and workplaces, kill nine million people annually, which is triple the number of deaths caused by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and 15 times higher than deaths caused by wars and other forms of human violence. The study concluded that \"pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the Anthropocene era. Pollution endangers the stability of the Earth’s support systems and threatens the continuing survival of human societies.\"\n\nPollution has been found to be present widely in the environment. There are a number of effects of this:\n\nThe Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP) at the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) maintains a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site that includes access to resources produced by TEHIP and by other government agencies and organizations. This web site includes links to databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and other scientific and consumer-oriented resources. TEHIP also is responsible for the Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases that are available free of charge on the web.\n\nTOXMAP is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that is part of TOXNET. TOXMAP uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Toxics Release Inventory and Superfund Basic Research Programs.\n\nA number of studies show that pollution has an adverse effect on the productivity of both indoor and outdoor workers.\n\nTo protect the environment from the adverse effects of pollution, many nations worldwide have enacted legislation to regulate various types of pollution as well as to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution.\n\nPollution control is a term used in environmental management. It means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil. Without pollution control, the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of controls, pollution prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than pollution control. In the field of land development, low impact development is a similar technique for the prevention of urban runoff.\n\n\n\nThe earliest precursor of pollution generated by life forms would have been a natural function of their existence. The attendant consequences on viability and population levels fell within the sphere of natural selection. These would have included the demise of a population locally or ultimately, species extinction. Processes that were untenable would have resulted in a new balance brought about by changes and adaptations. At the extremes, for any form of life, consideration of pollution is superseded by that of survival.\n\nFor humankind, the factor of technology is a distinguishing and critical consideration, both as an enabler and an additional source of byproducts. Short of survival, human concerns include the range from quality of life to health hazards. Since science holds experimental demonstration to be definitive, modern treatment of toxicity or environmental harm involves defining a level at which an effect is observable. Common examples of fields where practical measurement is crucial include automobile emissions control, industrial exposure (e.g. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) PELs), toxicology (e.g. ), and medicine (e.g. medication and radiation doses).\n\n\"The solution to pollution is dilution\", is a dictum which summarizes a traditional approach to pollution management whereby sufficiently diluted pollution is not harmful. It is well-suited to some other modern, locally scoped applications such as laboratory safety procedure and hazardous material release emergency management. But it assumes that the dilutant is in virtually unlimited supply for the application or that resulting dilutions are acceptable in all cases.\n\nSuch simple treatment for environmental pollution on a wider scale might have had greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative, human population and densities were lower, technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign. But these are often no longer the case. Furthermore, advances have enabled measurement of concentrations not possible before. The use of statistical methods in evaluating outcomes has given currency to the principle of probable harm in cases where assessment is warranted but resorting to deterministic models is impractical or infeasible. In addition, consideration of the environment beyond direct impact on human beings has gained prominence.\n\nYet in the absence of a superseding principle, this older approach predominates practices throughout the world. It is the basis by which to gauge concentrations of effluent for legal release, exceeding which penalties are assessed or restrictions applied. One such superseding principle is contained in modern hazardous waste laws in developed countries, as the process of diluting hazardous waste to make it non-hazardous is usually a regulated treatment process. Migration from pollution dilution to elimination in many cases can be confronted by challenging economical and technological barriers.\n\nCarbon dioxide, while vital for photosynthesis, is sometimes referred to as pollution, because raised levels of the gas in the atmosphere are affecting the Earth's climate. Disruption of the environment can also highlight the connection between areas of pollution that would normally be classified separately, such as those of water and air. Recent studies have investigated the potential for long-term rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide to cause slight but critical increases in the acidity of ocean waters, and the possible effects of this on marine ecosystems.\n\nThe Pure Earth, an international non-for-profit organization dedicated to eliminating life-threatening pollution in the developing world, issues an annual list of some of the world's most polluting industries.\n\nThe Pure Earth issues an annual list of some of the world's worst polluted places.\n\n"}

Almost all of them speak a Western Oghuz Turkic dialect that they call Turki, as well as Persian (the national language of Iran) in formal use. The Qashqai mainly live in the provinces of Fars, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Bushehr, and southern Isfahan, especially around the cities of Shiraz and Firuzabad in Fars. The majority of Qashqai people were originally nomadic pastoralists and some remain so today. The traditional nomadic Qashqai travelled with their flocks twice yearly to and from the summer highland pastures north of Shiraz roughly 480 km or 300 miles south to the winter pastures on lower (and warmer) lands near the Persian Gulf, to the southwest of Shiraz. The majority, however, have now become partially or wholly sedentary. The trend towards settlement has been increasing markedly since the 1960s.\n\nThe Qashqai are made up of five major tribes: the \"Amale\" (Qashqai) / \"Amaleh\" (Persian), the \"Dere-Shorlu / Darreh-Shuri\", the \"Kashkollu / Kashkuli\", the \"Shishbeyli / Sheshboluki\", and the \"Eymur / Farsimadan\". Smaller tribes include the \"Qaracha / Qarache'i\", \"Rahimli / Rahimi\", and \"Safi-Khanli / Safi-Khani\".\n\nHistorically, the Turkic languages are believed to have arrived in Iran from Central Asia from the 11th or 12th centuries onwards.\n\nThe Qashqai were a significant political force in Iran during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During World War I they were influenced by the German consular official Wilhelm Wassmuss and sided with the Germans. During World War II the Qashgais attempted to organize resistance against the British and Soviet occupation forces and received some ineffectual help from the Germans in 1943 by the means of Operation ANTON, which (along with Operation FRANZ) proved a complete failure. In 1945–1946 there was a major rebellion of a number of tribal confederacies, including the Qashgais, who fought valiantly until the invading Russians were repelled. The Qashgais revolted during 1962–1964 due to the land reforms of the White Revolution. The revolt was put down and within a few years many Qashqais had settled. Most of the tribal leaders were sent to exile. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979 the living leader, Khosrow Khan Qashqai, returned to Iran from exile in the United States and Germany.\n\nThe Qashqai tribal confederation consists of five major tribes, including the Dareshuri, Farsimadan, Sheshboluki, Amaleh, and Kashkuli.\n\nPeople of the Amaleh tribe were originally warriors and workmen attached to the household of the Ilkhani, or paramount chief; recruited from all the Qashqai tribes they constituted the Ilkhani’s bodyguard and retinue. By 1956, the Amaleh tribe comprised as many as 6,000 families.\n\nThe Dareshuri are said to have joined the Qashqai tribal confederation during the reign of Karim Khan Zand (1163-93/1750-79). According to Persian government statistics, there were about 5,169 Dareshuri families, or 27,396 individuals, in 1360 sh./1981.\nThe Dareshuri were “the greatest horse-breeders and owners among the Qashqai”. The policy of forced sedentarization of the nomadic tribes pursued by Reza Shah Pahlavi (1304–20 SH./1925-41) resulted in the loss of 80–90 percent of the Dareshuri horses, but the tribe made a recovery after World War II.\nReza Shah Pahlavi also executed Hossein khan Darehshouri the head of Darehshouri family in order to take back the control of the Fars province which was controlled by Darehshouri tribe during Ghajar empire.\n\nDuring World War I, the Kashkuli khans supported the British in their struggle against Ṣowlat-al-Dowla (Iyl-khan) and the German agent, Wilhelm Wassmuss. After the war, Ṣowlat-al-Dowla punished the Kashkuli. He dismissed the Kashkuli leaders who had opposed him and “deliberately set out to break up and impoverish the Kashkuli tribe”. Two sections of the tribe, which consisted of elements which had been loyal to Ṣowlat-al-Dowla, were then separated from the main body of the tribe and given the status of independent tribes, becoming the Kashkuli Kuchak (“Little Kashkuli”) and Qarachahi tribes. The remaining tribe became known as the Kashkuli Bozorg (“Big Kashkuli”) tribe.\nThe Kashkuli Bozorg tribe comprised 4,862 households in 1963. As Oliver Garrod observed, the Kashkuli Bozorg are “especially noted for their Jajims, or tartan woolen blankets, and for the fine quality of their rugs and trappings”.\n\n[information to be added]]\n\nThe Farsimadan claim that they are of Ḵhalaj origin, and that, before moving to southern Persia, they dwelled in Ḵalajestan, a region southwest of Tehran. The tribe was already in Fars by the late 16th century, for it is known that in October 1590 their leader, Abul-Qasem Beyg and some of his followers were punished for having sided with Yaqub Khan the Zul-Qadr governor of Fars, in a revolt against Shah Abbas I.\nThe population of the Farsimadan was estimated by Afshaar-Sistaani at 2,715 families or 12,394 individuals, in 1982.\n\nThe Qashqai are renowned for their pile carpets and other woven wool products. They are sometimes referred to as \"Shiraz\" because Shiraz was the major marketplace for them in the past. The wool produced in the mountains and valleys near Shiraz is exceptionally soft and beautiful and takes a deeper color than wool from other parts of Iran.\n\nQashqai carpets have been said to be \"probably the most famous of all Persian tribal weavings\". Qashqai saddlebags, adorned with colorful geometric designs, \"are superior to any others made\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "516937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=516937", "title": "Saemaul Undong", "text": "Saemaul Undong\n\nThe Saemaul Undong, also known as the New Community Movement, New Village Movement, Saemaul Movement or Saema'eul Movement, was a political initiative launched on April22, 1970 by South Korean president Park Chung-hee to modernize the rural South Korean economy. The idea was based on the Korean traditional communalism called \"Hyangyak\" (향약, 鄕約) and \"Doorae\" (두레), which provided the rules for self-governance and cooperation in traditional Korean communities. The movement initially sought to rectify the growing disparity of the standard of living between the nation's urban centres, which were rapidly industrializing, and the small villages, which continued to be mired in poverty. Diligence, self-help and collaboration were the slogans to encourage community members to participate in the development process. The early stage of the movement focused on improving the basic living conditions and environments whereas later projects concentrated on building rural infrastructure and increasing community income. Though hailed as a great success by force in the 1970s, the movement lost momentum during the 1980s due to the unexpected death of Park Chung-hee.\n\nThe movement promoted self-help and collaboration among the people during its first phase, as the central government provided a fixed amount of raw materials to each of the participating villages free of charge and entrusted the locals to build whatever they wished with them. The government first selected 33,267 villages and provided 335 sacks of cement. 16,600 villages that demonstrated success were then granted additional resources of 500 sacks of cement and a ton of iron bars.\n\nThe New Community Movement did much to improve infrastructure in rural South Korea, bringing modernized facilities such as irrigation systems, bridges and roads in rural communities. The program also marked the widespread appearance of orange tiled houses throughout the countryside, replacing the traditional thatched or \"choga-jip\" houses. Encouraged by the success in rural areas, the movement spread through factories and urban areas as well, and became a nationwide modernization movement.\n\nHowever, despite the Saemaul Movement's great success in reducing poverty and improving living conditions in rural areas during its first phase, income levels in urban areas were still higher than income levels in rural areas after the rapid industrialization of South Korea. The government-led movement with its highly centralized organization proved to be efficient in the 1970s and early 1980s, but it became less effective after South Korea entered into a more developed and industrialized stage, which diminished the momentum of the movement. The relatively low income levels in rural areas compared to urban areas became a major political issue in the late 1980s – one that no government intervention was able to fully solve during the first phase – and the movement proved ultimately inadequate in addressing the larger problem of migration from the villages to the cities by the country's younger demographic. Moreover, the government-led centralized system caused corruption, such as misuse of funding, and changed South Korea's environment. \n\nRecognizing these problems, the South Korean government changed the centralized structure of the movement by empowering civil society to lead the movement. Since 1998, the Saemaul Movement has entered into the second phase, focusing on new issues such as enhancing voluntary services in the community and international cooperation with developing countries.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and 70's when the policy started being implemented under the regime of President Park, local traditions and beliefs were suppressed, akin to the Cultural Revolution in communist China which happened at the same time. The movement \"Misin tapa undong\" (\"to defeat the worship of gods\"), also described as \"movement to destroy superstition\") reached its peak during the \"Saemaul Undong\" period. Old zelkova trees that had stood at village entrances and have traditionally served as guardian figures were cut down in order to erase \"superstition\". Practitioners of Korean shamanism were harassed, essentially destroying centuries old Korean traditions.\n\nThe Korea Saemaul Undong Center explains how Saemaul Undong was practiced in the 1970s in South Korea in five steps:\n\nStep 1. Basic Arrangements \n\nStep 2: Operation of Projects \n\nStep 3: Main Stage of Project Operation \n\nStep 4: Final Stage of the Project\nStep 5: Feedback at National Level\n\n\n"}

This is mainly due to the majority of the Tirahi people having assimilated into the dominant Pashtun culture of Afghanistan. In its place, Tirahi connects the Dardic languages spoken in Dardistan with languages which reach down to the mouth of the Indus River, showing Dardic influence. Thus, it could be the missing link connecting a chain of languages between the Hindu Kush and Goa. In possibly being the missing link, Dardic influence can even be found in the Central Indian Bhil Languages as well as the Konkani dialect of Marathi. Tirahi is also spoken in a couple of villages southeast of the Afghan city of Jalalabad, such as Jaba, Mitarani, and Bara-khel.\n\nTirahi is a Dardic language, along with Kalasha, Gawar-Bati, and Pashayi languages. Further, Tirahi is part of the sub-group of Kohistani languages along with languages such as Bateri, Chilisso, Gowro, and others. However, Tirahi also shares with languages spoken farther to the east, such as Kashmiri. As a Dardic Language, Tirahi strongly preserves some vocabulary of spoken Sanskrit (cow - dēn in Tirahi, dhēnuh in Sanskrit, hand - ast in Tirahi, hastah in Sanskrit). Being a language spoken in Afghanistan, Tirahi shares various words and grammatical constructs with Pashto, a language spoken throughout Afghanistan to which many Tirahi speakers have become accustomed to speaking.

Tirahi also shares some vocabulary with Kashmiri and Shina such as the Tirahi \"mala\", for a father, the Kashmiri \"mol\", and the Shina \"malo\".\n\nTirahi shows much influence from Pashto in phonology, lexicon and even morphology. However, its vocabulary exhibits a connection to Kohistani dialects. Therefore, Tirahi seems to occupy an intermediate position between Pashto and the Kohistani group. Morgenstirne claims that Tirahi is \"probably the remnant of a dialect group extending from Tirahi through the Peshawar district into Swat and Dir\"\n\nTirahi is an inflected language, having 5 cases: Nominative, Oblique, Genitive, Dative, and Ablative.

Its main political priorities also include improving social services to the poor, the movement's main base of support; fighting corruption and reducing administrative barriers for doing business. Leaders of UNM label themselves as liberal-conservative and in September 2007, the party became an observer member of the center-right European People's Party (EPP).\n\nSaakashvili and other Georgian opposition leaders formed a \"United People's Alliance\" in November 2003 to bring together the United National Movement, the United Democrats, the Union of National Solidarity and the youth movement \"Kmara\" in a loose alliance against the government of President Eduard Shevardnadze.\n\nThe United National Movement and its partners in the opposition played a central role in the November 2003 political crisis that ended in the forced resignation of President Shevardnadze.

In 1986, the University created the Institute for International Studies to integrate the Center and Brown's other international programs. In 1991, the Institute was rededicated in Watson's honor. Originally housed in five separate locations on campus, the programs of the Watson Institute moved into its current building, designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, in January 2002. In 2015, the Institute was renamed the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs to reflect the merger between the Watson Institute and the Taubman Center for Public Policy which had previously been housed in the Department of Political Science.\n\nWatson houses three undergraduate degree programs - Development Studies, International Relations and Public Policy. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A). The Graduate Program in Development (GPD) is an NSF-funded, interdisciplinary program that trains PhD candidates in anthropology, political science, economics, and sociology. The Public Policy program is a one-year intensive (summer – fall – spring) full-time degree with a focus on quantitative policy analysis and management. The Institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming.\n\nThe following area studies centers are based at Watson: the Brazil Initiative, the Africa Initiative, the Center for Contemporary South Asia (CCSA), the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), the China Initiative, and Middle East Studies (MES).\n\nTwo professional outreach programs are based at the Institute. The Brown International Advanced Research Institutes (BIARI) provides the opportunity for junior scholars and practitioners from all over the world to study together at the Institute. According to Watson's website, BIARI \"aims to build transnational scholarly networks while also providing opportunities for professional development. Each summer, BIARI brings promising young faculty from the Global South together with leading scholars in their fields for two-week intensive residential institutes.\"\n\nChoices develops and publishes curriculum resources for high school social studies classrooms, and leads seminars for secondary school teachers. The program's mission is \"to equip young people with the skills, habits, and knowledge necessary to be engaged citizens who are capable of addressing international issues with thoughtful public discourse and informed decision making.\"\n\nThe Watson Institute is the editorial home to two academic journals:\n\nWatson also publishes a working paper series, distributed by SSRN:\n\n"}

Wealth inequality remains a serious issue despite strong economic growth and improved social indicators observed over the past decade. A report release in 2013 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs entitled \"Inequality Matters. Report of the World Social Situation\", observed that: ‘Declines in the wage share have been attributed to the impact of labour-saving technological change and to a general weakening of labour market regulations and institutions. Such declines are likely to affect individuals in the middle and bottom of the income distribution disproportionately, since they rely mostly on labour income.’ In addition, the report noted that ‘highly-unequal land distribution has created social and political tensions and is a source of economic inefficiency, as small landholders frequently lack access to credit and other resources to increase productivity, while big owners may not have had enough incentive to do so.\n\nAccording to the ECLAC, Latin America is the most unequal region in the world. Inequality is undermining the region's economic potential and the well-being of its population, since it increases poverty and reduces the impact of economic development on poverty reduction. Children in Latin America are often forced to seek work on the streets when their families can no longer afford to support them, leading to a substantial population of street children in Latin America. According to some estimates, there are 40 million street children in Latin America. Inequality in Latin America has deep historical roots in the Latin European racially based Casta system instituted in Latin America in colonial times that have been difficult to eradicate since the differences between initial endowments and opportunities among social groups have constrained the poorest's social mobility, thus making poverty to be transmitted from generation to generation, becoming a vicious cycle. High inequality is rooted in the deepest exclusionary institutions of the Casta system that have been perpetuated ever since colonial times and that have survived different political and economic regimes. Inequality has been reproduced and transmitted through generations because Latin American political systems allow a differentiated access on the influence that social groups have in the decision making process, and it responds in different ways to the least favored groups that have less political representation and capacity of pressure. Recent economic liberalisation also plays a role as not everyone is equally capable of taking advantage of its benefits. Differences in opportunities and endowments tend to be based on race, ethnicity, rurality and gender. Because inequality in gender and location are near universal, race and ethnicity play a larger, more integral role in the unequal discriminatory practices in Latin America. These differences have a strong impact on the distribution of income, capital and political standing.\n\nIn 2008, According to UNICEF, Latin America and the Caribbean region had the highest combined income inequality in the world with a measured net Gini coefficient of 48.3, an unweighted average which is considerably higher than the world's Gini coefficient average of 39.7. Gini is the statistical measurement used to measure income distribution across entire nations and their populations and their income inequality. The other regional averages were: sub-Saharan Africa (44.2), Asia (40.4), Middle East and North Africa (39.2), Eastern Europe and Central Asia (35.4), and high-income nations (30.9).\n\nAccording to a study by the World Bank,the richest decile of the population of Latin America earn 48% of the total income, while the poorest 10% of the population earn only 1.6% of the income. In contrast, in developed countries, the top decile receives 29% of the total income, while the bottom decile earns 2.5%. The countries with the highest inequality in the region (as measured with the Gini index in the UN Development Report) in 2007 were Haiti (59.5), Colombia (58.5), Bolivia (58.2), Honduras (55.3), Brazil (55.0), and Panama (54.9), while the countries with the lowest inequality in the region were Venezuela (43.4), Uruguay (46.4) and Costa Rica (47.2).\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the poorest countries in the region were (as of 2008): Haiti, Nicaragua, Bolivia and Honduras. Undernourishment affects to 47% of Haitians, 27% of Nicaraguans, 23% of Bolivians and 22% of Hondurans.\n\nMany countries in Latin America have responded to high levels of poverty by implementing new, or altering old, social assistance programs such as conditional cash transfers. These include Mexico's , Brazil's Bolsa Escola and Bolsa Familia, Panama's Red de and Chile's Chile Solidario. In general, these programs provide money to poor families under the condition that those transfers are used as an investment on their children's human capital, such as regular school attendance and basic preventive health care. The purpose of these programs is to address the inter-generational transmission of poverty and to foster social inclusion by explicitly targeting the poor, focusing on children, delivering transfers to women, and changing social accountability relationships between beneficiaries, service providers and governments. These programs have helped to increase school enrollment and attendance and they also have shown improvements in children's health conditions. Most of these transfer schemes are now benefiting around 110 million people in the region and are considered relatively cheap, costing around 0.5% of their GDP. In some countries e.g. in Peru decentralisation is hoped to help address social justice and poverty better. NGOs which addressed those problems on the local level before could help with that.\n"}

{"id": "9072552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9072552", "title": "Xingu Indigenous Park", "text": "Xingu Indigenous Park\n\nThe Xingu Indigenous Park (, pronounced ) is an indigenous territory of Brazil, first created in 1961 as a national park in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Its official purposes are to protect the environment and the several tribes of Xingu indigenous peoples in the area.\n\nThe Xingu Indigenous Park is in the north east of the state of Mato Grosso, in the south of the Amazon biome.\nIt covers , with savannah and drier semi-deciduous forests in the south transitioning to Amazon rain forest in the north. \nThere is a rainy season from November to April.\nThe headwaters of the Xingu River are in the south of the park.\nThe area covered by the park was defined in 1961 and covers parts of the municipalities of Canarana, Paranatinga, São Félix do Araguaia, São José do Xingu, Gaúcha do Norte, Feliz Natal, Querência, União do Sul, Nova Ubiratã and Marcelândia in the state of Mato Grosso.\n\nThe national park was created after a campaign by the Villas-Bôas brothers for protection of the region. \nAn account of the exploration of this area by the Villas-Bôas brothers and their efforts to protect the region is documented in the film \"Xingu\" (2012).\n\nThe idea of creating a park originated with a round table organized by the vice president of Brazil in 1952, at which a much larger park was proposed. \nHowever, the state of Mato Grosso began granting land within the proposed area to colonizing companies, so the park that came into existence by decree 50.455 of 14 April 1961 was only a quarter of the proposed size.\nAdjustments were made on 31 July 1961, 6 August 1968 and 13 July 1971.\nThe final demarcation of the perimeter was made in 1978.\nThe area was given the designation of \"National Park\" to cover the dual purpose of protecting the environment and the indigenous people, and is subject to both the indigenous agency and the environmental agency.\nIn 1967 the term \"National Park\" was replaced by \"Indigenous Park\" to reflect the primary goal of protecting the social diversity of the indigenous people.\nThe park began to suffer from the incursion of fishermen and hunters in the 1980s.\nBy the late 1990s livestock farms to the north east of the park were starting to reach the park, as was deforestation to the west of the park. The effects of human activity outside the park were starting to pollute the waters of the park.\nThe park remains as an island of forest increasingly threatened by activity outside its perimeter.\n\nThe tribes occupying territories within the boundaries of the park are the Kamayurá (355), Kaiabi (745), Yudjá (248), Aweti (138), Mehinako (199), Wauja (321), Yawalapiti (208), Ikpeng (319), Kalapalo (417), Kuikuro (415), Matipu (119), Nahukwá (105), Suyá (334) and Trumai (120), population figures as of 2002. \n\nThe Xingu area is of interest because it was a destination for early-20th century exploration by Europeans, among whom British Captain Percy Harrison Fawcett was the most notable. He sought a city which Europeans had heard rumor of since their early 16th-century colonial contact, and he disappeared in the jungle in 1925. \n\nDavid Grann wrote an article about his exploration, followed by an expanded book, \"The Lost City of Z\" (2009) on the same subject and with the same title. It documents those early explorations. It also explores archeological evidence found since the late 20th century of large-scale indigenous civilizations that pre-date Spanish and Portuguese contacts and colonization.\n\n"}
