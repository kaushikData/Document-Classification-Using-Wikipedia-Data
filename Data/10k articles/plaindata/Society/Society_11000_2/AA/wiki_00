It is one of the largest transnational criminal gangs in Los Angeles, with 30,000 to 50,000 of members in 20 states across the US alone and is also allied with the Mexican Mafia. As listed in the Justice Department Report about 18th street and MS-13, \"These two gangs have turned the Central American northern triangle into the area with the highest homicide rate in the world.\"\n\n18th Street gang started near 18th Street and Union Avenue in the Rampart District of Los Angeles. There is conflicting information as to the exact area, but this is a generally accepted area by most academic sources. They were originally part of Clanton 14 but wanted to make a separate \"clique\" called Clanton 18th Street and allow immigrants the opportunity to join. This proposal was rejected by the Clanton 14, which led to the formation of the 18th Street gang. The two gangs have been bitter rivals ever since.\n\nThe 18th Street gang grew by expanding its membership to other nationalities and races, and it was among the first multiracial, multi-ethnic gangs in Los Angeles. In the beginning, they were made up largely of second-generation Hispanics. As the 18th Street gang began to battle with more established Hispanic gangs, they began to recruit outside the Hispanic community. There are approximately 200 separate individual autonomous gangs operating under the same name within separate \"barrios\" in the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, Riverside, East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Downtown Los Angeles, Pico Union, Inglewood, Lynwood, South Gate, Huntington Park, Maywood, Long Beach, Orange County, and Los Angeles' Westside, according to the latest figures from the NDIC. In the early 2000s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated wide-scale raids against known and suspected gang members, netting hundreds of arrests across the country.\n\nAlthough it started as a Mexican gang, 18th Street quickly became mainly Central American as it started to recruit more members of other ethnic groups. When Central American gang members were arrested in the United States, they were then deported back to Central America where the gang rose out-of-control on different levels of violence not just in El Salvador, but in Honduras and Guatemala as well, becoming one of the most violent gangs in Central America. 18th Street later became a bitter rival of MS-13 as both gangs wanted the top spot in Central America. Members of 18th street are mainly Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran, but the gang does have members from other parts of Central America. 18th Street influences have recently been spotted in Belize as well.\n\nIn El Salvador a faction called the \"Revolucionarios\" (\"Revolutionaries\") split off 18th Street in 2005, becoming rivals with the remaining members, who came to be known as the \"Sureños\".\n\nThe majority of 18th Street cliques operate throughout Southern California, but are active in other states and internationally as well. Los Angeles members began migrating to other areas outside America and started to establish their own cliques. 18th Street cliques have been identified in 120 cities in 37 states and the District of Columbia in the United States, as well internationally in Spain, Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Lebanon, Peru, Philippines, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.\n\n18th Street gang members are required to abide by a strict set of rules. Failure to obey the word of a gang leader, or to show proper respect to a fellow gang member, may result in an 18-second beating, or even execution for more serious offenses. According to the FBI, some factions of the 18th Street gang have developed a high level of sophistication and organization. 18th Street gang members often identify themselves with the number 18 on their clothing and sporting clothing from sports teams such as the Duke Blue Devils, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers and Oakland Raiders. 18th Street will use the symbols XV3, XVIII, X8, 99 (9+9=18), and 3-dots in their graffiti and tattoos. 18th Street colors are blue and black; blue is to represent and to pay tribute to The Mexican Mafia, and black is to represent the original color for the gang. The 18th Street gang is occasionally referred to as the \"Children's Army\" because of its recruitment of elementary and middle-school aged youth. They also allow other races to join their ranks making the gang Multi-ethnic. In El Salvador it is common for members of the gang to be tattooed on the face with a large \"18\". In many cases the tattoo covers the entire face.\n\n\"We recognize them as one of the most violent street gangs and one of the most prolific in the United States,\" says Special agent George Rodriguez, who until his retirement oversaw investigations for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Cars are stolen and homes are burglarized by the gang routinely. On average, someone in Los Angeles County is assaulted or robbed by 18th Streeters every day. The gang has left a bloody trail at a pace three times that of many of the city's most active gangs. 18th Street is a well established gang that is involved in all areas of street-crime. Some members have even become involved in producing fraudulent Immigration and Customs Enforcement identification cards and food stamps. Several 18th Street gang members have reached a higher level of sophistication and organization in their illicit activities than other gangs. While their main source of income is street-level distribution of drugs, they also have been linked to murders, assaults, arson, copyright infringement, extortion, human trafficking, illegal immigration, kidnapping, prostitution, robbery, and weapons trafficking, as well as other crimes. 18th Street Gang has also been implicated in the high-profile kidnapping and murder of the 16-year-old brother of internationally renowned Honduran football player Wilson Palacios.\n\nIn 1998, Catarino Gonzalez was sentenced to life in prison after a jury convicted Gonzalez of first-degree murder for fatally shooting Officer Filbert Cuesta in the back of the head, while the Officer was sitting in a patrol car.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19563640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19563640", "title": "Al Jolson", "text": "Al Jolson\n\nAl Jolson (born Asa Yoelson; May 26, 1886 – October 23, 1950) was an American singer, comedian, and stage and film actor. At the peak of his career, he was dubbed \"The World's Greatest Entertainer\". His performing style was brash and extroverted, and he popularized many songs that benefited from his \"shamelessly sentimental, melodramatic approach.\" \n\nIn the 1920s, Jolson was America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer. Between 1911 and 1928, Jolson had nine sell-out Winter Garden shows in a row, more than 80 hit records, and 16 national and international tours.\n\nAlthough best remembered today as the star of the first talking picture, \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), he starred in a series of successful musical films during the 1930s. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II. After a period of inactivity, his stardom returned with \"The Jolson Story\" (1946), for which Larry Parks played Jolson, with the singer dubbing for Parks. The formula was repeated in a sequel, \"Jolson Sings Again\" (1949). In 1950, he again became the first star to entertain GIs on active service in the Korean War, performing 42 shows in 16 days. He died weeks after returning to the U.S., partly owing to the physical exertion of performing. Defense Secretary George Marshall posthumously awarded him the Medal of Merit.\n\nAccording to the \"St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture\", \"Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll.\" Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular event out of singing a song, he became a rock star before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience. He would run up and down the runway, and across the stage, \"teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience\", often stopping to sing to individual members; all the while the \"perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance\". According to music historian Larry Stempel, \"No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway.\" Author Stephen Banfield wrote that Jolson's style was \"arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical\".\n\nJolson has been called \"the king of blackface\" performers, a theatrical convention since the mid-19th century. With his dynamic style of singing black music, such as jazz and blues, he became widely successful by extracting African-American music and popularizing it for white American audiences who were otherwise not receptive to the originators. Despite his promotion and perpetuation of black stereotypes, his work was sometimes well-regarded by black publications and he has sometimes been credited for fighting against black discrimination on Broadway as early as 1911. In an essay written in the 21st century, Tim Gioia of the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia remarked, \"If blackface has its shameful poster boy, it is Al Jolson\", showcasing Jolson's complex legacy in American society.\n\nAl Jolson was born as Asa Yoelson () in the Jewish village of Srednike () now known as Seredžius, near Kaunas in Lithuania, part of the Russian Empire. He was the fifth and youngest child of Moses Rubin Yoelson (c. 1858 – December 23, 1945) and Nechama \"Naomi\" Cantor (c. 1858 – February 6, 1895); his four siblings were Rose (c. 1879-1939), Etta (c. 1880-1948), another sister who died in infancy, and Hirsch (Harry) (c. 1882-1953). Jolson did not know his date of birth, as birth records were not kept at that time in that region, and he gave his birth year as 1885.\n\nIn 1891, his father, who was qualified as a rabbi and cantor, moved to New York City to secure a better future for his family. By 1894, Moses Yoelson could afford to pay the fare to bring Nechama and their four children to the U.S. By the time they arrived—as steerage passengers on the S/S \"Umbria\" arriving at the Port of New York on April 9, 1894—he had found work as a cantor at Talmud Torah Congregation in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where the family was reunited.\n\nHard times hit the family when his mother, Naomi, died at 37 in early 1895. Following his mother's death, young Asa was in a state of withdrawal for seven months. For a period of time, young Asa spent time at the St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a progressive reformatory/home for orphans run by the Xaverian Brothers in Baltimore (the same school which would later be attended by Babe Ruth). Upon being introduced to show business in 1895 by entertainer Al Reeves, Asa and Hirsch became fascinated by the industry, and by 1897 the brothers were singing for coins on local street corners, using the names \"Al\" and \"Harry\". They would usually use the money to buy tickets to shows at the National Theater. Asa and Hirsch spent most of their days working different jobs as a team.\n\nIn the spring of 1902, he accepted a job with Walter L. Main's Circus. Although Main had hired Jolson as an usher, Main was impressed by Jolson's singing voice and gave him a position as a singer during the circus' Indian Medicine Side Show segment. By the end of the year, the circus had folded and Jolson was again out of work. In May 1903, the head producer of the burlesque show \"Dainty Duchess Burlesquers\" agreed to give Jolson a part in one show. Asa gave a remarkable performance of \"Be My Baby Bumble Bee\" and the producer agreed to keep him for future shows. Unfortunately, the show closed by the end of the year. Asa was able to avoid financial troubles by forming a vaudeville partnership with his brother Hirsch, now a vaudeville performer known as Harry Yoelson. The brothers worked for the William Morris Agency.\n\nAsa and Harry soon formed a team with Joe Palmer. During their time with Palmer, they were able to gain bookings in a nationwide tour. However, live performances were falling in popularity as nickelodeons captured audiences; by 1908, nickelodeon theaters were dominant throughout New York City as well. While performing in a Brooklyn theater in 1904, Al decided on a new approach and began performing in blackface, which boosted his career. He began wearing blackface in all of his shows.\n\nIn late 1905, Harry left the trio following an argument with Al. Harry had refused Al's request to take care of Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair, while he was dating. After Harry's departure, Al and Joe Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906 the two agreed to separate, and Jolson was on his own. Jolson became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in San Francisco, California, and remained successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer. He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the earthquake-devastated people needed someone to cheer them up. In 1908 Jolson, needing money for himself and his new wife, Henrietta, returned to New York. In 1909, Al's singing caught the attention of Lew Dockstader, the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels. Al accepted Dockstader's offer and became a regular blackface performer.\n\nAccording to \"Esquire\" magazine, \"J.J. Shubert, impressed by Jolson's overpowering display of energy, booked him for \"La Belle Paree\", a musical comedy that opened at the Winter Garden in 1911. Within a month Jolson was a star. From then until 1926, when he retired from the stage, he could boast an unbroken series of smash hits.\"\n\nOn March 20, 1911, Jolson starred in his first musical revue at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City, \"La Belle Paree\", greatly helping to launch his career as a singer. The opening night drew a huge crowd to the theater, and that evening Jolson gained audience popularity by singing old Stephen Foster songs in blackface. In the wake of that opening night, Jolson was given a position in the show's cast. The show closed after 104 performances, and during its run Jolson's popularity grew greatly. Following \"La Belle Paree\", he accepted an offer to perform in the musical \"Vera Violetta\". The show opened on November 20, 1911 and, like \"La Belle Paree\", was a phenomenal success. In the show, Jolson again sang in blackface and managed to become so popular that his weekly salary of $500 (based on his success in \"La Belle Paree\") was increased to $750.\n\nAfter \"Vera Violetta\" ran its course, Jolson starred in another musical, \"The Whirl of Society\", propelling his career on Broadway to new heights. During his time at the Winter Garden, Jolson would tell the audience, \"You ain't heard nothing yet\" before performing additional songs. In the play, Jolson debuted his signature blackface character, \"Gus.\" The play was so successful that Winter Garden owner Lee Shubert agreed to sign Jolson to a seven-year contract with a salary of $1,000 a week. Jolson would reprise his role as \"Gus\" in future plays and by 1914 achieved so much popularity with the theater audience that his $1,000-a-week salary was doubled to $2,000 a week. In 1916, \"Robinson Crusoe, Jr.\" was the first musical in which he was featured as the star character. In 1918, Jolson's acting career would be pushed even further after he starred in the hit musical \"Sinbad\".\nIt became the most successful Broadway musical of 1918 and 1919. A new song was later added to the show that would become composer George Gershwin's first hit recording—\"Swanee\". Jolson also added another song, \"My Mammy,\" to the show. By 1920, Jolson had become the biggest star on Broadway.\n\nHis next play, \"Bombo\", would also take his career to new heights and became so successful that it went beyond Broadway and held performances nationwide. It also led Lee Shubert to rename his newly built theater, which was across from Central Park, as Jolson's 59th Street Theatre. Aged 35, Jolson became the youngest man in American history to have a theatre named after him.\n\nBut on the opening night of \"Bombo\", and the first performance at the new theatre, he suffered from extreme stage fright, walking up and down the streets for hours before showtime. Out of fear, he lost his voice backstage and begged the stagehands not to raise the curtains. But when the curtains went up, he \"was [still] standing in the wings trembling and sweating.\" After being physically shoved onto the stage by his brother Harry, he performed and received an ovation that he would never forget: \"For several minutes, the applause continued while Al stood and bowed after the first act.\" He refused to go back on stage for the second act, but the audience \"just stamped its feet and chanted 'Jolson, Jolson', until he came back out.\" He took 37 curtain calls that night and told the audience, \"I'm a happy man tonight.\"\n\nIn March 1922, he moved the production to the larger Century Theater for a special benefit performance to aid injured Jewish veterans of World War I. After taking the show on the road for a season, he returned in May 1923, to perform \"Bombo\" at his \"first love,\" the Winter Garden. The reviewer for \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"He returned like the circus, bigger and brighter and newer than ever. … Last night's audience was flatteringly unwilling to go home, and when the show proper was over, Jolson reappeared before the curtain and sang more songs, old and new.\"\n\n\"I don't mind going on record as saying that he is one of the few instinctively funny men on our stage,\" wrote reviewer Charles Darnton in the \"New York Evening World\". \"Everything he touches turns to fun. To watch him is to marvel at his humorous vitality. He is the old-time minstrel man turned to modern account. With a song, a word, or even a suggestion he calls forth spontaneous laughter. And here you have the definition of a born comedian.\"\n\nJolson often performed in blackface makeup. Performing in blackface makeup was a theatrical convention of many entertainers at the beginning of the 20th century, having its origin in the minstrel show. According to film historian Eric Lott:\n\"For the white minstrel man to put on the cultural forms of 'blackness' was to engage in a complex affair of manly mimicry... To wear or even enjoy blackface was literally, for a time, to become black, to inherit the cool, virility, humility, abandon, or \"gaité de coeur\" that were the prime components of white ideologies of black manhood.\"\n\nIn the retrospective view of a later era, however, the use of blackface has come to be viewed as implicit racism. Music critic Ted Gioia, commenting on Jolson's use of blackface, wrote:\n\n\"Blackface evokes memories of the most unpleasant side of racial relations, and of an age in which white entertainers used the makeup to ridicule black Americans while brazenly borrowing from the rich black musical traditions that were rarely allowed direct expression in mainstream society. This is heavy baggage for Al Jolson.\n\nHistorians have described Jolson's blackface and singing style as metaphors for Jewish and black suffering throughout history. Jolson's first film, \"The Jazz Singer\", for instance, is described by historian Michael Alexander as an expression of the liturgical music of Jews with the \"imagined music of African Americans,\" noting that \"prayer and jazz become metaphors for Jews and blacks.\" Playwright Samson Raphaelson, after seeing Jolson perform his stage show \"Robinson Crusoe\", stated that \"he had an epiphany: 'My God, this isn't a jazz singer', he said. 'This is a cantor!'\" The image of the blackfaced cantor remained in Raphaelson's mind when he conceived of the story which led to \"The Jazz Singer\".\n\nUpon the film's release, the first full-length sound picture, film reviewers saw the symbolism and metaphors portrayed by Jolson in his role as the son of a cantor wanting to become a \"jazz singer\":\nIs there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not. Indeed, I detected again and again the minor key of Jewish music, the wail of the Chazan, the cry of anguish of a people who had suffered. The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world's history.\n\nAccording to Alexander, Eastern European Jews were uniquely qualified to understand the music, noting how Jolson himself made the comparison of Jewish and African-American suffering in a new land in his film \"Big Boy\": In a blackface portrayal of a former slave, he leads a group of recently freed slaves, played by black actors, in verses of the classic slave spiritual \"Go Down Moses\". One reviewer of the film expressed how Jolson's blackface added significance to his role:When one hears Jolson's jazz songs, one realizes that jazz is the new prayer of the American masses, and Al Jolson is their cantor. The Negro makeup in which he expresses his misery is the appropriate talis [prayer shawl] for such a communal leader.\n\nMany in the black community welcomed \"The Jazz Singer\" and saw it as a vehicle to gain access to the stage. Audiences at Harlem's Lafayette Theater cried during the film, and Harlem's newspaper, \"Amsterdam News\", called it \"one of the greatest pictures ever produced.\" For Jolson, it wrote: \"Every colored performer is proud of him.\"\n\nJolson's legacy as the most popular performer of blackface routines was complemented by his relationships with African-Americans and his appreciation and use of African-American cultural trends. Jolson first heard jazz, blues, and ragtime in the alleys of New Orleans, Louisiana. He enjoyed singing the \"new\" jazz-style of music, often performing in blackface, especially in the songs he made popular, such as \"Swanee\", \"My Mammy\", and \"Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody\".\n\nAs a Jewish immigrant and America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer, he may have had the incentive and resources to help break down racial attitudes. While \"The Birth of a Nation\" glorified white supremacy and the KKK, Jolson chose to star in \"The Jazz Singer\", which defied racial bigotry by introducing American black music to audiences worldwide.\n\nWhile growing up, Jolson had many black friends, including Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, who became a prominent tap dancer. As early as 1911, at the age of 25, Jolson was noted for fighting discrimination on Broadway and later in his movies:\n\nAl Jolson once read in the newspaper that songwriters Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, neither of whom he had ever heard of, were refused service at a Connecticut restaurant because of their race. He immediately tracked them down and took them out to dinner, \"insisting he'd punch anyone in the nose who tried to kick us out!\" According to biographer Al Rose, Jolson and Blake became friends.\nThis didn't have anything to do with the theater, because they never worked together. Rather, they both had a love of prize fighting and used to go to boxing matches together, engaging in jocose discussion of the relative merits of Negro with Jewish pugilists. They would occasionally wager a bottle of whisky on these bouts.\n\nFilm historian Charles Musser notes that \"African Americans' embrace of Jolson was not a spontaneous reaction to his appearance in talking pictures. In an era when African Americans did not have to go looking for enemies, Jolson was perceived a friend.\"\n\nJeni LeGon, a black female tap dance star, recalls her life as a film dancer: \"But of course, in those times it was a 'black-and-white world.' You didn't associate too much socially with any of the stars. You saw them at the studio, you know, nice—but they didn't invite. The only ones that ever invited us home for a visit was Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler.\"\n\nBritish performer Brian Conley, former star of the 1995 British play \"Jolson\", stated during an interview, \"I found out Jolson was actually a hero to the black people of America. At his funeral, black actors lined the way, they really appreciated what he'd done for them.\"\n\nNoble Sissle, who was president of the Negro Actors Guild, represented that organization at his funeral.\n\nJolson's physical expressiveness also affected the music styles of some black performers. Music historian Bob Gulla writes that \"the most critical influence in Jackie Wilson's young life was Al Jolson.\" He points out that Wilson's ideas of what a stage performer could do to keep their act an \"exciting\" and \"thrilling performance\" was shaped by Jolson's acts, \"full of wild writhing and excessive theatrics\". Wilson felt that Jolson \"should be considered the stylistic [forefather] of rock and roll.\"\n\nAccording to the \"St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture\": \"Almost single-handedly, Jolson helped to introduce African-American musical innovations like jazz, ragtime, and the blues to white audiences... [and] paved the way for African-American performers like Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters... to bridge the cultural gap between black and white America.\" Jazz historian Amiri Baraka wrote, \"the entrance of the white man into jazz...did at least bring him much closer to the Negro.\" He points out that \"the acceptance of jazz by whites marks a crucial moment when an aspect of black culture had become an essential part of American culture.\"\n\nBefore \"The Jazz Singer\", Jolson starred in the talking film \"A Plantation Act\". This simulation of a stage performance by Jolson was presented in a program of musical shorts, demonstrating the Vitaphone sound-film process. The soundtrack for \"A Plantation Act\" was considered lost in 1933 but was found in 1995 and restored by The Vitaphone Project. The film was included in Warner's 80th Anniversary release of \"The Jazz Singer\" on DVD.\n\nWarner Bros. picked George Jessel for the role, as he had starred in the Broadway play. When Sam Warner decided to make \"The Jazz Singer\" a musical with the Vitaphone, he knew that Jolson was the star he needed. He told Jessel that he would have to sing in the movie, and Jessel balked, allowing Warner to replace him with Jolson. Jessel never got over it and often said that Warner gave the role to Jolson because he agreed to help finance the film.\n\nHarry Warner's daughter, Doris, remembered the opening night, and said that when the picture started she was still crying over the loss of her beloved uncle Sam. He was planning to be at the performance but died suddenly at the age of 40, the day before. But halfway through the 89-minute movie she began to be overtaken by a sense that something remarkable was happening. Jolson's \"Wait a minute\" line provoked shouts of pleasure and applause from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. After each Jolson song, the audience applauded. Excitement mounted as the film progressed, and when Jolson began his scene with Eugenie Besserer, \"the audience became hysterical.\"\n\nAccording to film historian Scott Eyman, \"by the film's end, the Warner brothers had shown an audience something they had never known, moved them in a way they hadn't expected. The tumultuous ovation at curtain proved that Jolson was not merely the right man for the part of Jackie Rabinowitz, alias Jack Robin; he was the right man for the entire transition from silent fantasy to talking realism. The audience, transformed into what one critic called, 'a milling, battling mob' stood, stamped, and cheered 'Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!'\"\n\nAt the end of the film, Jolson rose from his seat and ran down to the stage. \"God, I think you're really on the level about it. I feel good\" he cried to the audience. Stanley Watkins would always remember Jolson signing autographs after the show, tears streaming down his face. May McAvoy, Jolson's costar remembered that \"[the] police were there to control the crowds. It was a very big thing, like \"The Birth of a Nation\".\"\n\nThe film was produced by Warner Bros., using its new Vitaphone sound process. Vitaphone was originally intended for musical renditions, and \"The Jazz Singer\" follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound. Costar May McAvoy, according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. \"She pinned herself against a wall in the dark and watched the faces in the crowd. In that moment just before 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie,' she remembered, 'A miracle occurred. Moving pictures really came alive. To see the expressions on their faces, when Joley spoke to them ... you'd have thought they were listening to the voice of God.'\" \"Everybody was mad for the talkies,\" said movie star Gregory Peck in a \"Newsweek\" interview. \"I remember 'The Jazz Singer,' when Al Jolson just burst into song, and there was a little bit of dialogue. And when he came out with 'Mammy,' and went down on his knees to his Mammy, it was just dynamite.\"\n\nThis opinion is shared by Mast and Kawin:\n...this moment of informal patter at the piano is the most exciting and vital part of the entire movie...when Jolson acquires a voice, the warmth, the excitement, the vibrations of it, the way its rambling spontaneity lays bare the imagination of the mind that is making up the sounds ...[and] the addition of a Vitaphone voice revealed the particular qualities of Al Jolson that made him a star. Not only the eyes are a window on the soul.\n\nWith Warner Bros. Al Jolson made his first \"all-talking\" picture, \"The Singing Fool\" (1928), the story of an ambitious entertainer who insisted on going on with the show even as his small son lay dying. The film was even more popular than \"The Jazz Singer\". Although few theaters were equipped for sound films, \"The Singing Fool\" held the box office attendance record for eleven years until it was broken by \"Gone With the Wind\" a decade later. \"Sonny Boy\", from the film, was the first American record to sell one million copies.\n\nJolson continued to make features for Warner Bros. similar in style to \"The Singing Fool\". These included \"Say It with Songs\" (1929), \"Mammy\" (1930), and \"Big Boy\" (1930). A restored version of \"Mammy\", with Jolson in Technicolor sequences, was first screened in 2002. Jolson's first Technicolor appearance was a cameo in the musical \"Show Girl in Hollywood\" (1930) from First National Pictures, a Warner Bros. subsidiary. However, these films gradually proved a cycle of diminishing returns due to their comparative sameness, the regal salary that Jolson demanded, and a shift in public taste away from vaudeville musicals as the 1930s began. Jolson returned to Broadway and starred in the unsuccessful \"Wonder Bar\".\n\nDespite these new troubles, Jolson was able to make a comeback after performing a concert in New Orleans after \"Wonderbar\" closed in 1931. Warners allowed him to make one film with United Artists, \"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum\", in 1933 (the film had to be retitled \"Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp\" in the UK and other English-speaking countries where \"bum\" means \"bottom\" and where the slang word for a vagrant is \"tramp\" rather than \"bum\"). It was directed by Lewis Milestone and written by screenwriter Ben Hecht. Hecht was also active in the promotion of civil rights: \"Hecht film stories featuring black characters included \"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum\", co-starring Edgar Connor as Al Jolson's sidekick, in a politically savvy rhymed dialogue over Richard Rodgers music.\"\n\nA direct response to the Great Depression, it contains messages to his vagabond friends equivalent to \"there's more to life than money\" and \"the best things in life are free\". \"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote, \"The picture, some persons may be glad to hear, has no Mammy song. It is Mr. Jolson's best film and well it might be, for that clever director, Lewis Milestone, guided its destiny... a combination of fun, melody and romance, with a dash of satire...\" Another review added, \"A film to welcome back, especially for what it tries to do for the progress of the American musical...\"\n\nIn 1934, he starred in a movie version of his earlier stage play \"Wonder Bar\", co-starring Kay Francis, Dolores del Río, Ricardo Cortez, and Dick Powell. The movie is a \"musical \"Grand Hotel\", set in the Parisian nightclub owned by Al Wonder (Jolson). Wonder entertains and banters with his international clientele.\" Reviews were generally positive: \"\"Wonder Bar\" has got about everything. Romance, flash, dash, class, color, songs, star-studded talent and almost every known requisite to assure sturdy attention and attendance... It's Jolson's comeback picture in every respect.\"; and, \"Those who like Jolson should see Wonder Bar for it is mainly Jolson; singing the old reliables; cracking jokes which would have impressed Noah as depressingly ancient; and moving about with characteristic energy.\"\n\nReturning to Warners, Jolson bowed to new production ideas, focusing less on the star and more on elaborately cinematic numbers staged by Busby Berkeley and Bobby Connolly. This new approach worked, sustaining Jolson's movie career until the Warner contract lapsed in 1935. Jolson co-starred with his actress-dancer wife, Ruby Keeler, only once, in \"Go Into Your Dance\".\n\nJolson's last Warner vehicle was \"The Singing Kid\" (1936), a parody of Jolson's stage persona (he plays a character named Al Jackson) in which he mocks his stage histrionics and taste for \"mammy\" songs—the latter via a number by E. Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen titled \"I Love to Singa\", and a comedy sequence with Jolson doggedly trying to sing \"Mammy\" while The Yacht Club Boys keep telling him such songs are outdated.\n\nAccording to jazz historian Michael Alexander, Jolson had once griped that \"People have been making fun of Mammy songs, and I don't really think that it's right that they should, for after all, Mammy songs are the fundamental songs of our country.\" (He said this, in character, in his 1926 short \"A Plantation Act\".) In this film, he notes, \"Jolson had the confidence to rhyme 'Mammy' with 'Uncle Sammy'\", adding \"Mammy songs, along with the vocation 'Mammy singer', were inventions of the Jewish Jazz Age.\"\n\nThe film also gave a boost to the career of black singer and bandleader Cab Calloway, who performed a number of songs alongside Jolson. In his autobiography, Calloway writes about this episode:\n\"The Singing Kid\" was not one of the studio's major attractions (it was released by the First National subsidiary), and Jolson did not even rate star billing. The song \"I Love to Singa\" later appeared in Tex Avery's cartoon of the same name. The movie also became the first important role for future child star Sybil Jason in a scene directed by Busby Berkeley. Jason remembers that Berkeley worked on the film although he is not credited.\n\nHis next movie—his first with Twentieth Century-Fox—was \"Rose of Washington Square\" (1939). It stars Jolson, Alice Faye and Tyrone Power, and included many of Jolson's best known songs, although several songs were cut to shorten the movie's length, including \"April Showers\" and \"Avalon\". Reviewers wrote, \"Mr Jolson's singing of \"Mammy\", California, Here I Come and others is something for the memory book\" and \"Of the three co-stars this is Jolson's picture … because it's a pretty good catalog in anybody's hit parade.\" The movie was released on DVD in October 2008. 20th Century Fox hired him to recreate a scene from \"The Jazz Singer\" in the Alice Faye-Don Ameche film \"Hollywood Cavalcade\". Guest appearances in two more Fox films followed that same year, but Jolson never starred in a full-length feature film again.\n\nAfter the George M. Cohan film biography, \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" (1942), Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky believed that a similar film could be made about Al Jolson. Skolsky pitched the idea of an Al Jolson biopic and Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures agreed. It was directed by Alfred E. Green, best remembered for the pre-Code \"Baby Face\" (1933), with musical numbers staged by Joseph H. Lewis. With Jolson providing almost all the vocals, and Columbia contract player Larry Parks playing Jolson, \"The Jolson Story\" (1946) became one of the biggest box-office hits of the year.\n\nLarry Parks wrote, in a personal tribute to Jolson:Stepping into his shoes was, for me, a matter of endless study, observation, energetic concentration to obtain, perfectly if possible, a simulation of the kind of man he was. It is not surprising, therefore, that while making \"The Jolson Story\", I spent 107 days before the cameras and lost eighteen pounds in weight.\n\nFrom a review in \"Variety\":\nBut the real star of the production is that Jolson voice and that Jolson medley. It was good showmanship to cast this film with lesser people, particularly Larry Parks as the mammy kid... As for Jolson's voice, it has never been better. Thus the magic of science has produced a composite whole to eclipse the original at his most youthful best.\nParks received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Although the 60-year-old Jolson was too old to play a younger version of himself in the movie, he persuaded the studio to let him appear in one musical sequence, \"Swanee\", shot entirely in long shot, with Jolson in blackface singing and dancing onto the runway leading into the middle of the theater. In the wake of the film's success and his World War II tours, Jolson became a top singer among the American public once more. Decca Records signed Jolson and he recorded for Decca until his death.\n\nAccording to film historian Krin Gabbard, \"The Jolson Story\" goes further than any of the earlier films in exploring the significance of blackface and the relationships that whites have developed with blacks in the area of music. To him, the film seems to imply an inclination of white performers, like Jolson, who are possessed with \"the joy of life and enough sensitivity, to appreciate the musical accomplishments of blacks\". To support his view he describes a significant part of the movie:\nWhile wandering around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club where a group of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances … Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.\n\nThis has been a theme which was traditionally \"dear to the hearts of the men who made the movies.\" Film historian George Custen describes this \"common scenario, in which the hero is vindicated for innovations that are initially greeted with resistance … [T]he struggle of the heroic protagonist who anticipates changes in cultural attitudes is central to other white jazz biopics such as \"The Glenn Miller Story\" (1954) and \"The Benny Goodman Story\" (1955)\". \"Once we accept a semantic change from singing to playing the clarinet, \"The Benny Goodman Story\" becomes an almost transparent reworking of \"The Jazz Singer\" … and \"The Jolson Story\".\"\n\nA sequel, \"Jolson Sings Again\" (1949), opened at Loew's State Theatre in New York and received positive reviews: \"Mr. Jolson's name is up in lights again and Broadway is wreathed in smiles\", wrote Thomas Pryor in \"The New York Times\". \"That's as it should be, for \"Jolson Sings Again\" is an occasion which warrants some lusty cheering...\". Jolson did a tour of New York film theaters to plug the movie, traveling with a police convoy to make timetables for all showings, often ad libbing jokes and performing songs for the audience. Extra police were on duty as crowds jammed the streets and sidewalks at each theater Jolson visited. In Chicago, a few weeks later, he sang to 100,000 people at Soldier Field, and later that night appeared at the Oriental Theatre with George Jessel where 10,000 people had to be turned away.\n\nIn Baltimore, Maryland, he took his wife Erle to St Mary's Industrial School in Baltimore, where he had been confined for a while as a boy and treated for tuberculosis. He introduced her to the same Xaverian Brother, Brother Benjamin, who watched over him. That night, Jolson took over two hundred of the church's kids to see \"Jolson Sings Again\" at the Hippodrome Theatre. A few weeks later, the Jolsons were received by President Harry Truman at the White House.\n\nJolson had been a popular guest star on radio since its earliest days, including on NBC's \"The Dodge Victory Hour\" (January 1928), singing from a New Orleans hotel to an audience of 35 million via 47 radio stations. His own 1930s shows included \"Presenting Al Jolson\" (1932) and \"Shell Chateau\" (1935), and he was the host of the \"Kraft Music Hall\" from 1947 to 1949, with Oscar Levant as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Jolson's 1940s career revival was nothing short of a success despite the competition of younger performers such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, and he was voted the \"Most Popular Male Vocalist\" in 1948 by a poll in \"Variety\". The next year, Jolson was named \"Personality of the Year\" by the Variety Clubs of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer of any importance not to make a record of \"Mule Train\", which had been a widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson joked about how his voice had deepened with age, saying \"I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop like I used to.\"\n\nIn addition to his contribution to motion pictures as a performer, he is responsible for the discovery of two major stars of the golden age of Hollywood. He purchased the rights to a play he saw on Broadway and then sold the movie rights to Jack Warner (Warner Brothers which was the studio that had made \"The Jazz Singer\") with the stipulation that two of the original cast members reprise their roles in the movie. The play became the movie titled \"Penny Arcade\". Those actors were Joan Blondell and James Cagney. They both went on to become contract players for the studio. The two were major ingredients in gangster movies which were quite lucrative for the studio.\n\nCagney won his Academy Award for his role in Warner Brothers' \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" which at the time was the studio's highest-grossing movie. The award is rarely given to performers in musicals. Ironically Cagney who became known for his tough guy movie roles also made a contribution to movie musicals like the man who had discovered him. While Jolson is credited for appearing in the first movie musical, Cagney's Academy Award-winning movie was the first movie Ted Turner chose to colorize.\n\nWhen Jolson appeared on Steve Allen's KNX Los Angeles radio show in 1949 to promote \"Jolson Sings Again\", he offered his curt opinion of the burgeoning television industry: \"I call it smell-evision.\" Writer Hal Kanter recalled that Jolson's own idea of his television debut would be a corporate-sponsored, extra-length spectacular that would feature him as the only performer, and would be telecast without interruption. Even though he had several TV offers at the time, Jolson was apprehensive about how his larger than life performances would come across in a medium as intimate as television. He finally relented in 1950, when it was announced that Jolson had signed an agreement to appear on the CBS television network, presumably in a series of specials. However, he died suddenly before production began.\n\nJapanese bombs on Pearl Harbor shook Jolson out of continuing moods of lethargy due to years of little activity and \"... he dedicated himself to a new mission in life... Even before the U.S.O. began to set up a formal program overseas, Jolson was deluging War and Navy Department brass with phone calls and wires. He requested permission to go anywhere in the world where there was an American serviceman who wouldn't mind listening to 'Sonny Boy' or 'Mammy'... [and] early in 1942, Jolson became the first star to perform at a GI base in World War II\".\n\nFrom a 1942 interview in \"The New York Times\": \"When the war started... [I] felt that it was up to me to do something, and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army.\" Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering \"to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he \"would work without pay... [and] would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose\". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), \"the group his letter to Early had helped create\".\n\nHe did as many as four shows a day in the jungle outposts of Central America and covered the string of U.S. Naval bases. He paid for part of the transportation out of his own pocket. Upon doing his first, and unannounced, show in England in 1942, the reporter for the \"Hartford Courant\" wrote, \"... it was a panic. And pandemonium... when he was done the applause that shook that soldier-packed room was like bombs falling again in Shaftsbury Avenue.\"\n\nFrom an article in \"The New York Times\": \nHe [Jolson] has been to more Army camps and played to more soldiers than any other entertainer. He has crossed the Atlantic by plane to take song and cheer to the troops in Britain and Northern Ireland. He has flown to the cold wastes of Alaska and the steaming forests of Trinidad. He has called at Dutch‑like Curaçao. Nearly every camp in this country has heard him sing and tell funny stories. Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for \"Variety\", in 1942: \nIn order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and I would give a show.After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, \nAllow me to say on behalf of all the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here is quite the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to us, and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person. We unanimously elect you Public Morale Lifter No. 1 of the U.S Army.\n\nJolson was officially enlisted in the United Service Organizations (USO), the organization which provided entertainment for American troops who served in combat overseas. Because he was over the age of 45, he received a \"Specialist\" rating that permitted him to wear a uniform and be given the standing of an officer. While touring in the Pacific, Jolson contracted malaria and had to have his left lung surgically removed. In 1946, during a nationally broadcast testimonial dinner in New York City, given on his behalf, he received a special tribute from the American Veterans Committee in honor of his volunteer services during World War II. In 1949, the movie \"Jolson Sings Again\" recreated some scenes showing Jolson during his war tours.\n\nIn 1950, according to Jolson's biographer Michael Freedland, \"the United States answered the call of the United Nations Security Council … and had gone to fight the North Koreans. … [Jolson] rang the White House again. 'I'm gonna go to Korea,' he told a startled official on the phone. 'No one seems to know anything about the USO, and it's up to President Truman to get me there.' He was promised that President Truman and General MacArthur, who had taken command of the Korean front, would get to hear of his offer. But for four weeks there was nothing. … Finally, Louis A. Johnson, Secretary of Defense, sent Jolson a telegram. 'Sorry for delay but regret no funds for entertainment – STOP; USO disbanded – STOP.' The message was as much an assault on the Jolson sense of patriotism as the actual crossing of the 38th Parallel had been. 'What are they talkin' about', he thundered. 'Funds? Who needs funds? I got funds! I'll pay myself!'\"\n\nOn September 17, 1950, a dispatch from 8th Army Headquarters, Korea, announced, \"Al Jolson, the first top-flight entertainer to reach the war-front, landed here today by plane from Los Angeles...\" Jolson traveled to Korea at his own expense. \"[A]nd a lean, smiling Jolson drove himself without letup through 42 shows in 16 days.\"\n\nBefore returning to the U.S., General Douglas MacArthur, leader of UN forces, gave him a medallion inscribed \"To Al Jolson from Special Services in appreciation of entertainment of armed forces personnel ‑ Far East Command\", with his entire itinerary inscribed on the reverse side. A few months later, an important bridge, named the \"Al Jolson Bridge\", was used to withdraw the bulk of American troops from North Korea. The bridge was the last remaining of three bridges across the Han River and was used to evacuate UN forces. It was demolished by UN forces after the army made it safely across in order to prevent the Chinese from crossing.\n\nAlistair Cooke wrote, \"He [Jolson] had one last hour of glory. He offered to fly to Korea and entertain the troops hemmed in on the United Nations precarious August bridgehead. The troops yelled for his appearance. He went down on his knee again and sang 'Mammy', and the troops wept and cheered. When he was asked what Korea was like he warmly answered, 'I am going to get back my income tax returns and see if I paid enough.'\" Jack Benny, who went to Korea the following year, noted that an amphitheater in Korea where troops were entertained, was named the \"Al Jolson Bowl.\"\n\nNew U.S.O. movie\n\nJust 10 days after he returned from Korea, he had agreed with RKO Pictures producers Jerry Wald and Norman Krasna to star in a new movie, \"Stars and Stripes for Ever\", about a USO troupe in the South Pacific during World War II. The screenplay was to be written by Herbert Baker and to costar Dinah Shore.\n\nJolson had however greatly overexerted himself performing in Korea, especially for a man who was missing a lung, and only two weeks after signing the agreement, he died of a heart attack in San Francisco. A few months after his death, Defense Secretary George Marshall presented the Medal for Merit for Jolson, \"to whom this country owes a debt which cannot be repaid\". The medal, carrying a citation noting that Jolson's \"contribution to the U.N. action in Korea was made at the expense of his life\", was presented to Jolson's adopted son as Jolson's widow looked on. Columbia too had been thinking about a third Jolson musical, and this time Jolson would play himself. The project, tentatively entitled \"You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet\", was to dramatize Jolson's recent tours of military bases. The projected film was abruptly cancelled.\n\nJolson was a Republican who supported Warren G. Harding in 1920 and Calvin Coolidge in 1924 for president. As \"one of the biggest stars of his time, [he] worked his magic singing \"Harding, You're the Man for Us\" to enthralled audiences ... [and] was subsequently asked to perform \"Keep Cool with Coolidge\" four years later. ... Jolson, like the men who ran the studios, was the rare showbiz Republican.\" Jolson publicly campaigned for Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932. By the next presidential election (1936), he was back to supporting Republican Alf Landon and would not support another Democrat for president during his life.\n\nHis first marriage to Henrietta Keller (1889-1967) took place in Alameda California, on September 20, 1907. His name was given as Albert Jolson. They divorced in 1919.\n\nIn 1920, Jolson began a relationship with Broadway actress Alma Osbourne (known professionally as Ethel Delmar); the two were married in August 1922; she divorced Jolson in 1928.\n\nIn the summer of 1928, Jolson met young tap dancer, and later actress, Ruby Keeler, in Los Angeles (Jolson would claim it was at Texas Guinan's night club) and was dazzled by her on sight. Three weeks later, Jolson saw a production of George M. Cohan's \"Rise of Rosie O'Reilly\", and noticed she was in the show's cast. Now knowing she was going about her Broadway career, Jolson attended another one of her shows, \"Show Girl\", and rose from the audience and engaged in her duet of \"Liza\". After this moment, the show's producer, Florenz Ziegfeld, asked Jolson to join the cast and continue to sing duets with Keeler. Jolson accepted Ziegfeld's offer and during their tour with Ziegfeld, the two started dating and were married on September 21, 1928. In 1935, Al and Ruby adopted a son, Jolson's first child, whom they named \"Al Jolson Jr.\" In 1939, however—despite a marriage that was considered to be more successful than his previous ones—Keeler left Jolson. After their 1940 divorce, she remarried, to John Homer Lowe, with whom she would have four children and remain married until his death in 1969.\n\nIn 1944, while giving a show at a military hospital in Hot Springs, Arkansas, Jolson met a young X-ray technologist, Erle Galbraith. He became fascinated with her and more than a year later he was able to track her down and hired her as an actress while he served as a producer at Columbia Pictures. After Jolson, whose health was still scarred from his previous battle with malaria, was hospitalized in the winter of 1945, Erle visited him and the two quickly began a relationship. They were married on March 22, 1945. During their marriage, the Jolsons adopted two children, Asa Jr. (born 1948) and Alicia (born 1949), and remained married until his death in 1950.\n\nAfter a year and a half of marriage, his new wife had never seen him perform in front of an audience, and the first occasion came unplanned. As told by actor comedian Alan King, it happened during a dinner by the New York Friars' Club at the Waldorf Astoria in 1946, honoring the career of Sophie Tucker. Jolson and his wife were in the audience along with a thousand others, and George Jessel was emcee. He asked Al, privately, to perform at least one song. Jolson replied, \"No, I just want to sit here.\"\n\nThen later, without warning, during the middle of the show, Jessel says, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the easiest introduction I ever had to make. The world's greatest entertainer, Al Jolson.\" King recalls what happened next:\n\nDespite their close relationship while growing up, Harry did show some disdain for Al's success over the years. Even during their time with Jack Palmer, Al was rising in popularity while Harry was fading. After separating from Al and Jack, Harry's career in show business, however, sank greatly. On one occasion—which was another factor in his on-off relationship with Al—Harry offered to be Al's agent, but Al rejected the offer, worried about the pressure that he would have faced from his producers for hiring his brother as his agent. Shortly after Harry's wife Lillian died in 1948, Harry and Al became close once again.\n\nThe dust and dirt of the Korean front, from where he had returned a few weeks earlier, had settled in his remaining lung and he was close to exhaustion. While playing cards in his suite at the St. Francis Hotel at 335 Powell Street in San Francisco, Jolson died of a massive heart attack on October 23, 1950. His last words were said to be \"Oh...oh, I'm going.\" His age was given as 64.\n\nAfter his wife received the news of his death by phone, she went into shock, and required family members to stay with her. At the funeral, police estimated upwards of 20,000 people showed up, despite the threat of rain. It became one of the biggest funerals in show business history. Celebrities paid tribute: Bob Hope, speaking from Korea via short wave radio, said the world had lost \"not only a great entertainer, but also a great citizen.\" Larry Parks said that the world had \"lost not only its greatest entertainer, but a great American as well. He was a casualty of the [Korean] war.\" Scripps-Howard newspapers drew a pair of white gloves on a black background. The caption read, \"The Song Is Ended.\"\n\nNewspaper columnist and radio reporter Walter Winchell said,\nHe was the first to entertain troops in World War Two, contracted malaria and lost a lung. Then in his upper sixties he was again the first to offer his singing gifts for bringing solace to the wounded and weary in Korea.<br>Today we know the exertion of his journey to Korea took a greater toll of his strength than perhaps even he realized. But he considered it his duty as an American to be there, and that was all that mattered to him. Jolson died in a San Francisco hotel. Yet he was as much a battle casualty as any American soldier who has fallen on the rocky slopes of Korea … A star for more than 40 years, he earned his most glorious star rating at the end—a gold star.\n\nFriend George Jessel said during part of his eulogy, \n\nHe was interred in the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. Jolson's widow purchased a plot at Hillside and commissioned his mausoleum to be designed by well-known black architect Paul Williams. The six-pillar marble structure is topped by a dome, next to a three-quarter-size bronze statue of Jolson, eternally resting on one knee, arms outstretched, apparently ready to break into another verse of \"Mammy\". The inside of the dome features a huge mosaic of Moses holding the tablets containing the Ten Commandments, and identifies Jolson as \"The Sweet Singer of Israel\" and \"The Man Raised Up High\".\n\nOn the day he died, Broadway dimmed its lights in Jolson's honor, and radio stations all over the world were paying tributes. Soon after his death, the BBC presented a special program entitled \"Jolson Sings On\". His death unleashed tributes from all over the world, including a number of eulogies from friends, including George Jessel, Walter Winchell, and Eddie Cantor. He contributed millions to Jewish and other charities in his will.\n\nAl Jolson has three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame:\n\nIn 2000, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. Jolson is also a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.\n\nForty-four years after Jolson's death, the United States Postal Service honored him by issuing a postage stamp. The 29-cent stamp was unveiled by Erle Jolson Krasna, Jolson's fourth wife, at a ceremony in New York City's Lincoln Center on September 1, 1994. This stamp was one of a series honoring popular American singers, which included Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole, Ethel Merman, and Ethel Waters. In 2006, Jolson had a street in New York named after him with the help of the Al Jolson Society.\n\nIn October 2008 the documentary \"Al Jolson and The Jazz Singer\" premiered at the 50th Lübeck Nordic Film Days, Lübeck, Germany, and won 1st Prize at an annual film competition in Kiel a few weeks later. In November 2007, a similar documentary, \"A Look at Al Jolson\", was winner at the same festival.\n\nAccording to music historians Bruce Crowther and Mike Pinfold: \"During his time he was the best known and most popular all-around entertainer America (and probably the world) has ever known, captivating audiences in the theatre and becoming an attraction on records, radio, and in films. He opened the ears of white audiences to the existence of musical forms alien to their previous understanding and experience … and helped prepare the way for others who would bring a more realistic and sympathetic touch to black musical traditions.\" Black songwriter Noble Sissle, in the 1930s, said \"[h]e was always the champion of the Negro songwriter and performer, and was first to put Negroes in his shows\". Of Jolson's \"Mammy\" songs, he adds, \"with real tears streaming down his blackened face, he immortalized the Negro motherhood of America as no individual could.\"\n\nHowever, Jolson's signature style, loud and passionate, was soon eclipsed by the cooler and more intimate style of the crooners, singers such as Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, who dominated the pop charts in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. While Jolson could and did croon, his basic style was formed in the era when a singer needed to project to the back of a theater with his own physical power; later singers who developed in the microphone era were freed from this constraint.\n\nA few of the people and places that have been influenced by Jolson:\n\nTony Bennett\nMy father...took us to see one of the first talking pictures, \"The Singing Fool\", in which Al Jolson sang \"Sonny Boy\". In a way, you could say that Jolson was my earliest influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie...to imitate Jolson...I leaped into the living room and announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, \"Me Sonny Boy!\" The whole family roared with laughter.\n\nIrving Berlin\n\nBing Crosby\n\nBobby Darin\n\nNeil Diamond\n\nEddie Fisher\n\nJudy Garland\n\nErnest Hemingway\n\nJerry Lewis\n\nJerry Lee Lewis\n\nMario Lanza\n\nDavid Lee Roth\n\nRod Stewart\n\nJackie Wilson\n\nState of California\n\n\n\n"}

She was well known for her role as the Devi Sita in \"Lava Kusa\" as well as for the titular roles in movies like \"Suvarna Sundari\" and \"Anarkali\".\n\nAnjali Devi was born in Peddapuram, East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh, India, as Anjamma. She changed her name to Anjani Kumari when acting in dramas. Later, director C. Pullaiah changed her name to Anjali Devi.\n\nShe was a theatre artiste before venturing into movies. Her debut film role was as Lohitasya in \"Raja Harishchandra\" in 1936. Her first movie as a heroine was \"Kashtajeevi\" by L. V.

She has acted in nearly 500 films. \"Brundavanam\" (1992), \"Anna Vadina\" (1993) and \"Police Alludu\" (1994) were the last few films of her career. In Balaiah's \"Police Alludu\" and \"Anna Vadina\" she appeared alongside Brahmanandam. She acted in various roles, such as a damsel, an angel, a dancer, a demon, a goddess, a traditional woman and later in mother roles.\n\nIn 1955 she produced the film \"Anarkali\", in which she herself played the titular role, with Akkineni Nageswara Rao as Prince Salim. Then she produced V. Madhusudan Rao's \"Bhakta Tukaram\" and \"Chandipriya\". Bollywood and Tollywood actress Jayapradha played the lead role in the latter alongside Shobhan Babu and Chiranjeevi. As a producer she has produced 27 films. She was an ardent devotee of Sathyasai Baba and produced a tele-serial on Sathyasai.\n\nShe married P. Adinarayana Rao, a music director, in 1940. They settled in Chennai. They have two sons. Together, they produced many Telugu films under the banner, Anjali Pictures. Their granddaughter, Saila Rao, is also an actress.\n\nDevi died at the age of 86 on 13 January 2014 at Vijaya Hospital, in Chennai, due to a cardiac arrest.

It has started from 1864, when the Chinese built the Transcontinental Railroad. In 1882, The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was added. Its origins have been traced to the American merchants, missionaries, and diplomats who sent home from China \"relentlessly negative\" reports of the people they encountered there. These attitudes were transmitted to Americans who never left North America, triggering talk of the Yellow Peril, and continued through the Cold War during McCarthyism. Modern anti-Chinese sentiment is the result of China's rise as a major world power. Anti-Chinese sentiment or sinophobia is a broad opposition or hostility to the people, policies, culture, or politics of China.\n\nStarting with the California Gold Rush in the middle 19th century, the United States—particularly the West Coast states—imported large numbers of Chinese migrant laborers. Early Chinese immigrant worked as gold miners, and later on subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad. The decline of the Qing Dynasty in China caused many Chinese to emigrate overseas in search of a more stable life, and this coincided with the rapid growth of American industry. The Chinese were considered by employers as \"reliable\" workers who would continue working, without complaint, even under destitute conditions.\n\nChinese migrant workers encountered considerable prejudice in the United States, especially by the people who occupied the lower layers in white society, because Chinese \"coolies\" were used as a scapegoat for depressed wage levels by politicians and labor leaders. Cases of physical assaults on Chinese include the Chinese massacre of 1871 in Los Angeles and the murder of Vincent Chin. The 1909 murder of Elsie Sigel in New York, of which a Chinese person was suspected, was blamed on the Chinese in general and led to physical violence. \"The murder of Elsie Sigel immediately grabbed the front pages of newspapers, which portrayed Chinese men as dangerous to \"innocent\" and \"virtuous\" young white women. This murder led to a surge in the harassment of Chinese in communities across the United States.\"\n\nThe emerging American trade unions, under such leaders as Samuel Gompers, also took an outspoken anti-Chinese position, regarding Chinese laborers as competitors to white laborers. Only with the emergence of the international trade union Industrial Workers of the World did trade unionists start to accept Chinese workers as part of the American working-class.\n\nDuring this period, the phrase \"yellow peril\" was popularized in the U.S. by newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst. It was also the title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, G. G. Rupert, who published \"The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident\" in 1911. Based on the phrase \"the kings from the East\" in the Christian scriptural verse Revelation 16:12, Rupert, who believed in the doctrine of British Israelism, claimed that China, India, Japan and Korea were attacking England and the U.S., but that Jesus Christ would stop them. In his 1982 book \"The Yellow Peril: Chinese Americans in American fiction, 1850-1940\", William F. Wu states that \"Pulp magazines in the 30s had a lot of yellow peril characters loosely based on Fu Manchu... Most were of Chinese descent, but because of the geopolitics at the time, a growing number of people were seeing Japan as a threat, too.\"\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s various legal discriminatory measures were taken against the Chinese. These laws, in particular the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, were aimed at restricting further immigration from China, although the laws were later repealed by the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943. Another key piece of legislation was the Naturalization Act of 1870, which extended citizenship rights to African Americans but barred Chinese from naturalization on the grounds that they and other Asians could not be assimilated into American society. Unable to become citizens, Chinese immigrants were prohibited from voting and serving on juries, and dozens of states passed alien land laws that prohibited non-citizens from purchasing real estate, thus preventing them from establishing permanent homes and businesses. The idea of an \"unassimilable\" race became a common argument in the exclusionary movement against Chinese Americans. In particular, even in his lone dissent against Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), then-Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote of the Chinese as: \"a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.\"\n\nIn the USA xenophobic fears against the alleged \"Yellow Peril\" led to the implementation of the Page Act of 1875, the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, expanded ten years later by the Geary Act. The Immigration Act of 1917 then created an \"Asian Barred Zone\" under nativist influence.\n\nThe Chinese Exclusion Act was one of the most significant restrictions on free immigration in U.S. history. The Act excluded Chinese \"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. Many Chinese were relentlessly beaten just because of their race. The few Chinese non-laborers who wished to immigrate had to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to immigrate, which tended to be difficult to prove.\n\nThe 1921 Emergency Quota Act, and then the Immigration Act of 1924, restricted immigration according to national origins. While the Emergency Quota Act used the census of 1910, xenophobic fears in the WASP community lead to the adoption of the 1890 census, more favorable to White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) population, for the uses of the Immigration Act of 1924, which responded to rising immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, as well as Asia.\n\nOne of the goal of this National Origins Formula, established in 1929, was explicitly to keep the status quo distribution of ethnicity, by allocating quotas in proportion to the actual population. The idea was that immigration would not be allowed to change the \"national character\". Total annual immigration was capped at 150,000. Asians were excluded but residents of nations in the Americas were not restricted, thus making official the racial discrimination in immigration laws. This system was repealed with the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.\n\nAccording to statistics, between 1820 and 1840, only 11 Chinese people emigrated to the United States. However, many Chinese were living in distress due to the end of the Qing Dynasty. The United States offered a more stable life, thanks to the gold rush in California, the construction of railways, and the resulting large demand for labor. Beginning in 1848, many Chinese chose to immigrate to the US.\n\nIn order to recruit more laborers, the United States and China signed the Burlingame Treaty in 1868. The Burlingame Treaty provided several rights, including that Chinese people can freely enter and leave the United States; the right of abode in the United States; and the United States most-favored treatment of Chinese nationals in the United States. The Treaty stimulated immigration for the 20 years between 1853 to 1873, and resulted in the immigration of nearly 105,000 Chinese to the United States by 1880.\n\n1882 was an election year in California. In order to secure more votes, California politicians adopted a staunch anti-China stance. In Congress, California Republican Senator John Miller spoke at length in support of a bill to prohibit further Chinese immigrants, substantially the same as one from the prior session of Congress that had been vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. Senator Miller submitted a motion to ban the immigration Chinese laborers for 20 years, citing the passage of the 1879 anti-Chinese referendums in California and Nevada by huge margins as proof of popular support. The motion was discussed in the Senate over the next eight days. All the Senators from western states and most of the southern Democratic Party supported Miller's proposal, strenuously objected to the eastern states senator. After intense debate, the motion eventually passed the Senate by a vote of 29 of 15; it would go on to pass in the House of Representatives on March 23, by 167 votes to 66 votes (55 abstentions).\n\nPresident Chester A. Arthur vetoed the bill on April 4, 1882, as it violated the provisions of the Angell Treaty, which restricted but did not ban immigration from China. Congress was unable to overturn the veto, and passed a version of the bill that banned immigration for ten years in lieu of the original twenty-year ban. On May 6, 1882, Miller's proposal was signed by President Arthur, and became the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. \n\nAmendments introduced during the debate over the bill prohibited the naturalization of Chinese immigrants. After the initial ten-year ban ended, Chinese Exclusion was extended in 1892 by the Geary Act and then made permanent in 1902. California Governor John McDougal in 1851 praised the Chinese as \"the most valuable immigrants\" to California.\n\nThe Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 shifted Americans' fears of the Yellow Peril from China to Japan.\n\nAnti-Chinese sentiment during the Cold War was largely the result of the Red Scare and McCarthyism, which coincided with increased popular fear of communist espionage because of the Chinese Civil War and China's involvement in the Korean War. During the era, suspected Communists were imprisoned in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs. Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, had a real past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party. However, for the vast majority, both the potential for them to do harm to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous. Among these victims were Chinese Americans, who were suspected of being affiliated with the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China.\n\nThe most notable example is that of the top Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen. Allegations were made that he was a communist, and his security clearance was revoked in June 1950. The Federal Bureau of Investigation located an American Communist Party document from 1938 with his name on it, and used it as justification for the revocation. Without his clearance, Qian found himself unable to pursue his career, and within two weeks, he announced plans to return to mainland China, which had come under the government of Communist leader Mao Zedong. The Undersecretary of the Navy at the time, Dan A. Kimball, tried to keep Qian in the US: \nIt was the stupidest thing this country ever did. He was no more a Communist than I was, and we forced him to go.\n\nQian would spend the next five years under house arrest, which included constant surveillance with the permission to teach without any research (classified) duties. Caltech appointed attorney Grant Cooper to defend Qian. In 1955, the United States deported him to China in exchange for five American pilots captured during the Korean War. Later, he became the father of the modern Chinese space program.\n\nModern anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States may originate from American fears of China's role as a rising power. Perceptions of China's rise have been so widespread that 'rise of China' has been named the top news story of the 21st century by the Global Language Monitor, as measured by number of appearances in the global print and electronic media, on the Internet and blogosphere, and in Social Media.\n\nIn the United States 2010 elections, a significant number of negative advertisements from both major political parties focused on a candidates' alleged support for free trade with China. Some of the stock images that accompanied ominous voiceovers about China were actually of Chinatown, San Francisco. In particular, an advertisement called \"Chinese Professor\", which portrays a 2030 conquest of the West by China, used local Asian American extras to play Chinese, but the actors were not informed of the nature of the shoot. Columnist Jeff Yang said that in the campaign there was a \"blurry line between Chinese and Chinese-Americans.\" Larry McCarthy, the producer of \"Chinese Professor,\" defended his work by saying that \"this ad is about America, it's not about China.\" Other editorials commenting on the video have called the video not anti-Chinese.\n\nAs part of the Chinese exclusion policy of NASA, many American space researchers were prohibited from working with Chinese citizens affiliated with a Chinese state enterprise or entity. In April 2011, the 112th United States Congress banned NASA from using its funds to host Chinese visitors at NASA facilities. Earlier in 2010, Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) had urged President Barack Obama not to allow further contact between NASA and the China National Space Administration (CNSA).\n\nDonald Trump took a number of anti-Chinese stances during the 2016 campaign such as saying that China is \"raping\" the U.S. with free trade. \n\nIn November 2015, Trump promised to designate China as a currency manipulator on his first day in office. He pledged \"swift, robust and unequivocal\" action against Chinese piracy, counterfeit American goods, and the theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property. He also condemned China's \"illegal export subsidies and lax labor and environmental standards.\"\n\nIn January 2016, Trump proposed a 45% tariff on Chinese exports to the United States to give \"American workers a level playing field.\" When asked about potential Chinese retaliation to the implementation of tariffs, such as sales of US bonds, Trump judged such a scenario to be unlikely: \"They won't crash our currency. They will crash their economy. That's what they are going to do if they start playing that.\" In a May 2016 speech, Trump responded to concerns regarding a potential trade war with China: \"We're losing $500 billion in trade with China. Who the hell cares if there's a trade war?\"\n\n\n"}

It is derived from the root \"ker\", which has two root meanings: fear and respect. Ateker, in its true sense, is a union of free people with mutual recognition and respect for each other. In the context of ethnic identity and nationhood, the Turkana language classifies different people with common characteristics as belonging to distinct \"ateker\".

The Society offers three scholarships each year to help young riders develop their skills, and a number of recognition awards are also made. Owners, trainers and riders of ponies entered into BSPS championship shows must all be members of the society before the date of the show in which the pony qualified (though if they have never been BSPS members before, they may become members within seven days of the qualifying show), and all ponies shown at BSPS Championship shows must be registered with the society (though for animals never registered before, registration is allowed to take place within seven days after a pony has qualified at a qualifying show). Heritage Mountain and Moorland ponies must also be registered with their own breed society.\n\nThe country is divided into 17 areas, plus Scotland and Ireland, and members join the appropriate area for where they live. Members earn points by competing at shows in their area. Each area is run under a franchise from the BSPS, and is responsible for its own funding, from which it has to cover organisation of all BSPS events within its own area.\n\nIn 2007, the BSPS united with 14 other British showing societies to create the Showing Council, an organization to represent the societies with the British Equestrian Federation.\n\nThe showing of horses and ponies is widespread around the UK. The BSPS offers a large range of classes for the affiliated show rider or horse. Around 500 shows each year are run by the BSPS areas, with showing divided into the summer season (April to August) and the winter season (October to March) which consists of competitions mainly aimed at novice ponies, with each season having its own championships. The summer season championships are usually held in August, and the winter season championships in April.\n\nPonies must be four years of age or over (age taken from 1 January of the year in which it was born), and riders must be a minimum of three years of age.

A Rugby pelham, which, with its separate loose rings imitating the double bridle, is preferred by many as it removes the necessity for a pony to have two bits in its mouth. In the working hunter and non-jumping hunter pony classes it is considered more 'correct' for ponies to be shown in plain leather 'hunt type' bridles, while fancy browbands are used in children's riding pony classes.\n\nThe correct dress for riders includes a hat which meets the current approved safety standards, riding jacket (tweed is considered the appropriate jacket for showing Heritage Mountain and Moorland ponies and hunter ponies, with a dark showing jacket for children's riding ponies), shirt and tie or stock, and breeches with long boots or jodhpurs with jodhpur boots.\n\nAll ponies apart from the Heritage Mountain and Moorland ponies must have their manes plaited, with tails either plaited or neatly pulled.\n\nThe BSPS, in conjunction with the British Horse Society, run a number of examinations each year in which people can qualify to become a Show Groom, an Assistant Trainer, or an Accredited Trainer.

{"id": "4965161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4965161", "title": "Caste system in Kerala", "text": "Caste system in Kerala\n\nThe caste system in Kerala differed from that found in the rest of India. While the Indian caste system generally modelled the four-fold division of society into Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, in Kerala the Nambudiri Brahmins formed the priestly class and only rarely recognised anyone else as being other than Shudra or untouchables outside the caste system entirely. Thus, the Kerala caste system was ritualised but it was not the \"varna\" model found elsewhere.\nEven inside Kerala, North Kerala castes are different from South Kerala. Until recent past, they did not follow marriage alliances sighting the differences. \nKerala hindu upper castes are basically dominated by a multi caste groups collectively called as \"Nairs\".\nKeralas caste system was more of a feudelistic set up, than a \"Varna\" system. Unlike the other part of India Nambuthiris and their spill out clans \"Ambalavasis and Samamntha Nairs\" held the vast majority of the lands sometimes even exceeding the kings.\n\nAlso, Kerala had one of the highest migration of different cultures at different times in history, due to its geographical connectivity. The migrants include, Babilonians, Arabians, Jews, later different Europians, Srilankans, Budhists monks, Jains and many more. The native Keralites are Adivasis, Pulayan, Parayan, Malayan etc. Infact these castes have their own caste systems and some of them consideres themself superior to all castes of Hindus. Eg: Kurichiar\n\nA theory presented by Pullapilly and also by Rene Barendse, who is a Fellow of the International Institute for Asian Studies, claims that the caste system established by Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala was in accordance with the will of Parasurama, an avatar of Vishnu.The Nambudiris had control of 64 villages and asserted that they had powers given to them by the gods, so much so that they considered even other Brahmin groups to be outside the caste hierarchy. Both writers consider this to be the traditional Nambudiri myth of origin. The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy, outranking even the kings. Anyone who was not a Nambudiri was treated by them as an untouchable.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, the caste system of Kerala had evolved to be the most complex to be found anywhere in India, and the exploitation of it had become considerable. Barendse explains this development: \n\nBy this time there were over 500 groups represented in an elaborate structure of relationships and the concept of ritual pollution extended not merely to untouchability but even further, to un-approachability and even un-seeability. The system was gradually reformed to some degree, with one of those reformers, Swami Vivekananda, having observed that it represented a \"mad house\" of castes. The usual four-tier Hindu caste system, involving the \"varnas\" of Brahmin (priest), Kshatriya (warrior), Vaishya (business person, involved in trading, entrepreneurship and finance) and Shudra (service person), did not exist. Kshatriyas and vaishyas were rare.kshatriya castes such as Varma and vaishya castes as such a vaniyan,vanika,vanika vaishya,arya vaishya constituted less than 2% of the total population.\nThe roles left empty by the absence of these two ritual ranks were taken to some extent by a few Nairs and by Syrian Christians, respectively.\n\nThe process of amelioration of caste distinctions by various social reform movements were overtaken by the events of 1947. With independence from Britain came the Indian constitution, and Article 15 of that document outlawed discrimination on the grounds of caste and race. Myron Weiner has said that the ideological basis for caste \"... may be (almost, but not quite) moribund\" and that: \n\nWeiner points out that despite the ideological demise: \n\nAlthough distinctions between the various communities are outlawed, the Indian governments – both at national and at regional level – do still recognise them, but this recognition is for the purpose of positive discrimination. Throughout post-independence India, including in Kerala, there exists a framework of reservation which is fluid in nature and attempts to recognise the socio-economic disparities between various castes. Depending both on local circumstances and on the changing modern socio-economic environment, castes are classified as Forward Classes (or \"General\"), Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and the Scheduled Tribes. These classifications determine what - if any - assistance a caste community receives in any given area. Formal classification lists are compiled for the latter three groups; any community which is not listed in any of those categories is, by default, a Forward Class.\n\nWriting in the context of violence against Dalits elsewhere in India, \"Frontline\" magazine said in 2006 that: However, \"Frontline\" goes on to note that the situation in Kerala now, is not as severe, to the extent that those seeking to research: \n\nThe Nambudiris had varying rules regarding the degrees of ritual pollution while interacting with people of different castes, which also included other Brahmins- such as Iyers, whose touch required a Nambudiri to bathe before resuming rituals. In a similar manner, most castes practised the principles of untouchability in their relationship with the other regional castes. Untouchability in Kerala is not restricted to Hindus, and George Mathew says that, \"Technically, the Christians were outside [the] caste hierarchy, but in practice a system of inclusion and exclusion was developed ...\". Among Christians, the established Syrian Christians also practised the rules of untouchability. In the colonial period, many lower castes were converted to Christians by the European Missionaries, but the new converts were not allowed to join the Syrian Christian community and they continued to be considered as untouchables even by the Syrian Christians. Syrian Christians derive status within the caste system from the tradition that they were elites, who were evangelised by Thomas the Apostle. Anand Amaladass says that \"The Syrian Christians had inserted themselves within the Indian caste society for centuries and were regarded by the Hindus as a caste occupying a high place within their caste hierarchy.\" Syrian Christians followed the same rules of caste and pollution as that of Hindus and they were considered as pollution neutralisers. Rajendra Prasad, an Indian historian, said that the Syrian Christians took ritual baths after physical contact with lower castes .\n\nThe rules of untouchability were severe to begin with, and they were very strictly enforced by the time of the arrival of the Dutch East India Company in the seventeenth century. Robin Jeffrey, who is a professor specialising in the modern history and politics of India, quotes the wife of a Christian missionary, who wrote in 1860 that: \n\nNonetheless, higher ranked communities did have some social responsibility for those perceived to be their inferiors: for example, they could demand forced labour but had to provide food for such labourers, and they had a responsibilities in times of famine to provide their tenants both with food and with the seeds to grow it. There were also responsibilities to protect such people from the dangers of attack and other threats to their livelihood, and so it has been described by Barendse as \"an intricate dialectic of rights and duties\".\n\nSambandham or sambandham (literally \"relationship\") was a marital system primarily followed by the Nair and Ambalavasi castes in the state of Kerala. All of these were matrilineal communities. The hypergamous institution of sambandam was involved in the establishment of and competition for status among these higher caste groups.The custom is no longer observed.\n\nAround 2003, the Government of Kerala recognised 53 Scheduled Castes, 35 Scheduled Tribes and 80 Other Backwards Classes. The 2001 Census of India recognised 68 Scheduled Castes, who comprised 9.8% of the population. They were 99.9% Hindu, with a negligible number of Sikhs and Buddhists. The Census recognised 35 Scheduled Tribes, comprising 1.14% of the population and with 93.7% being Hindus. A further 5.8% were Christian, and the remainder Muslim or \"not stated\".\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "23845151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23845151", "title": "Feminist views on prostitution", "text": "Feminist views on prostitution\n\nThere exists a diversity of views on prostitution. Many of these positions can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of prostitution and sex work.\n\nAnti-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution is a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men.\n\nPro-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of sex work can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system.\n\nThe disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the feminist sex wars (acrimonious debates on sex issues) of the late twentieth century.\n\nNewman and White in Women, Politics and Public Policy argue that feminist perspectives on prostitution agree on three main points: “First, they condemn the current legal policy enforcing criminal sanctions against women who offer sex in exchange for money. Second, they agree that authentic consent is the sine qua non of legitimate sex, whether in commercial or non-commercial form. Third, all feminists recognize that commercial sex workers are subject to economic coercion and are often victims of violence, and that little is done to address these problems.”\n\nThey go on to identify three main feminist views on the issue of prostitution. The sex work perspective, the abolitionist perspective and the outlaw perspective. The sex work perspective maintains that prostitution is a legitimate form of work for women faced with the option of other bad jobs, therefore women ought to have the right to work in the sex trade free of prosecution or the fear of it. The sex work perspective also argues that governments should eliminate laws that criminalize voluntary prostitution. This, the sex work perspective asserts, will allow prostitution to be regulated by governments and business codes, protect sex trade workers, and improve the ability to prosecute people who hurt them. The Abolitionist perspective holds that governments should work towards the elimination of prostitution. The Outlaw Perspective views work in the sex trade as a “stepping stone to a better career or an expression of sexual freedom”.\n\nA proportion of feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution, as they see the practice as a form of violence against women, which should not be tolerated by society. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include Kathleen Barry, Melissa Farley, Julie Bindel, Sheila Jeffreys, Catharine MacKinnon and Laura Lederer. Their arguments against prostitution are explained and detailed below.\n\nThese feminists do argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances.\n\nThese feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. \"If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?\". A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation.\nCatharine MacKinnon argues that \"In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape.\"\n\nSome anti-prostitution scholars hold that true consent in prostitution is not possible. Barbara Sullivan says, \"In the academic literature on prostitution there are very few authors who argue that valid consent to prostitution is possible. Most suggest that consent to prostitution is impossible or at least unlikely.\". \"(...) most authors suggest that consent to prostitution is deeply problematic if not impossible (...) most authors have argued that consent to prostitution is impossible. For radical feminists this is because prostitution is always a coercive sexual practice. Others simply suggest that economic coercion makes the sexual consent of sex workers highly problematic if not impossible...\".\n\nFinally, abolitionists believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others. In the words of Kathleen Barry, consent is not a “good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression. Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of “consent,” since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see any alternative.\n\nAnti-prostitution feminists argue that prostitution is a practice which leads to serious negative long-term effects for the prostitutes, such as trauma, stress, depression, anxiety, self-medication through alcohol and drug use, eating disorders and a greater risk for self-harm and suicide, as they say prostitution is an exploitative practice, which involves a woman who has sex with customers to whom she is not attracted, and which also routinely exposes the women to psychological, physical and sexual violence.\n\nAndrea Dworkin stated her opinions as: \"Prostitution in and of itself is an abuse of a woman's body. Those of us who say this are accused of being simple-minded. But prostitution is very simple. (…) In prostitution, no woman stays whole. It is impossible to use a human body in the way women's bodies are used in prostitution and to have a whole human being at the end of it, or in the middle of it, or close to the beginning of it. It's impossible. And no woman gets whole again later, after.”\n\nAnti-prostitution feminists are extremely critical of sex-positive perspectives, wherein prostitution by choice is said to be part of the sexual liberation of women, that it can be empowering for women, etc. Some feminists who oppose prostitution agree that sexual liberation for women outside of prostitution is important in the fight for gender equality, but they say it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality - e.g., that women should not have sex outside marriage/a relationship and that casual sex is shameful for a woman, etc. - with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view - acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice which is based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man’s sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man and that the woman’s response and satisfaction are irrelevant. These feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved as long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman.\n\nSuch feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. These feminists believe that many clients use the services of prostitutes because they enjoy the \"power trip\" they derive from the act and the control they have over the woman during the sexual activity. Catharine MacKinnon argues that prostitution \"isn't sex only, it’s you do what I say, sex.\"\n\nProstitution is seen by these feminists as the result of a patriarchal societal order which subordinates women to men and where the inequality between genders is present in all aspects of life. These feminists believe that prostitution is very harmful to society as it reinforces the idea that women are sex objects which exist for men's enjoyment, which can be \"bought\" and which can be \"used\" solely for men's sexual gratification. Anti-prostitution feminists argue that when a society accepts prostitution it sends the message that it is irrelevant how the woman feels during sex or what the consequences of sex will be for her, and that it is acceptable for a man to engage in sexual activity with a woman who does not enjoy it and who could be mentally and emotionally forcing herself in order to be able to cope; the normalization of such one sided sexual encounters might negatively affect the way men relate to women in general and might increase sexual violence against women.\n\nThese feminists see prostitution as a form of slavery, and say that, far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution leads to a sharp \"increase\" in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes, saying, \"Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women.\"\n\nSome feminists, including many who identify as supporting the abolition of prostitution, see the selling of sex as a potential after effect of violence against women. Those who support this position cite studies of violence experienced by women in prostitution prior to entering prostitution. Most (60% to 70%) were sexually abused as children 65% have been raped, most before the age of 15, and that many young women and girls enter prostitution directly from state care, at least in England, Norway, Australia and Canada.\n\nProstitution abolitionists also object to the high rates of violence against women in the sex industry. Studies of women in prostitution show an extremely high level of violence is perpetrated against women in prostitution. Figures vary across studies. One representative study showed 82% of respondents had been physically assaulted since entering prostitution, 55% of those by clients. Additionally, 80% had been physically threatened while in prostitution, 83% of those with a weapon. 8% reported physical attacks by pimps and clients of a nature that resulted in serious injury, for example gunshot wounds and knife wounds. 68% reported having been raped since entering prostitution, 48% more than five times and 46% reporting rapes committed by clients. Finally, 49% reported pornography was made of them while they were in prostitution and 32% had been upset by an attempt to make them do what clients had seen in pornography. Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear. Many brothels have installed panic buttons because of the ongoing threat of violence indoors.\n\nBeyond the individual instances of violence or the history of violence suffered by most women in prostitution, prostitution abolitionists see prostitution itself as a form of male violence against women and children. This understanding is the major theoretical root of calls to decriminalize prostitution(mostly women), but continue to criminalize those who prostitute them, including clients, pimps, procurers and traffickers. Similarly, in other forms of violence against women, anti-violence feminists expect women who are battered, raped, incested, harassed and threatened will not be punished for the crimes committed against them, while the male perpetrators, mostly known to the victims, will suffer criminalization in accordance with the law.\n\nProstitution abolitionists also cite similarities between prostitution and violence against women. Farley, Lynne and Cotton (2005) argue the prostitution is most like battery because it similarly involves a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour (by pimps, procurers and traffickers as well as clients) that results in the control of the women in prostitution. Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence. Some prostitutes argue prostitution has similarities to rape because it is a form of sexuality that is entirely controlled by the client, as rape is a form of sexuality in which the rapist controls the interaction, disregarding the desires, physical well-being or emotional pain of the victim.\n\nProstitution abolitionists adopt an intersectional approach to understanding the power relations involved in prostitution. That is, they see prostitution as compelled by multiple forms of oppressive social power, not just sexism against women. Some analysts on human rights issues surrounding prostitution, such as Sigma Huda in her report for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, also adopt this approach:\n\nAbolitionists attribute prostitution to women's comparative lack of economic resources. Globalisation and neoliberalism have exacerbated already unequal economic relations, including by cutting back social spending in Northern and formerly socialist countries, and increasing the demand for cheap labour, including in prostitution, in both Southern and Northern countries. Combined with sex discrimination in wages and job type, sexual harassment in the workplace, and an undue burden of caring for children, the elderly and the ill, women are at a significant economic disadvantage in the current economic structure. Poverty is the single greatest “push” factor making women vulnerable to accepting prostitution as a means of subsistence.\n\nIn addition, racism shapes women's entry into prostitution, both because it makes women more vulnerable to prostitution and because clients demand racialized women in prostitution. Racism in education, economic and political systems affect the choices of women of colour. Additionally, racist sexualisation, through pornography in particular, of Black and Asian women as over-sexed and submissive or otherwise available for prostitution contributes to the demand for specifically racialized women. Massage parlours, strip clubs and other prostitution businesses are often located in poor and racialized neighbourhoods, encouraging clients to troll those neighbourhoods for women, making all women in those neighbourhoods vulnerable to prostitution-related harassment and women in those neighbourhoods more likely to accept their use in prostitution as normal.\n\nIndigenous women around the world are particularly targeted for prostitution. In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price. It is common for indigenous women to be over-represented in prostitution when compared with their total population. This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them. The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women. Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women.\n\nIn 1999, Sweden became the first country to make it illegal to pay for sex, but not to be a prostitute (the client commits a crime, but not the prostitute). Similar laws were passed in Norway (in 2009) and in Iceland (in 2009). In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the 'Swedish Model' of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling of sex. In 2014, the Council of Europe has made a similar recommendation, stating that \"While each system presents advantages and disadvantages, policies prohibiting the purchase of sexual services are those that are more likely to have a positive impact on reducing trafficking in human beings\".\n\nDuring 2011, the newly elected government of Denmark began discussing the possibility of banning the buying of sexual services. while during 2009, there is lobbying taking place for such a law in Hungary.\n\nThese laws are a natural extension of the views of the feminists who oppose prostitution. These feminists reject the idea that prostitution can be reformed, and oppose any harm reduction approach. Trisha Baptie, a Canadian former prostitute, who now opposes the industry, and lobbies for the outlawing of buying sexual services, wrote: \"Harm reduction ? You can’t make prostitution \"safer\" ; prostitution is violence in itself. It is rape, the money only appeases men’s guilt, \" \"One of the most “sex-positive” things you can do is make sure men cannot buy sex, because the buying of sex is violence against women and is a direct deterrent to women’s equality. \"\n\nThese feminists see prostitution as a form of violence against women and vehemently condemn the common pro-legalization argument that \"prostitution has always existed and will never go away\", arguing that other violent acts such as murder, rape and child sexual abuse have also always existed and will never be eradicated either, and that is not a reason to legalize them. These feminists argue that the idea of legalizing prostitution in order to control it and \"make it a little better\" and reduce harm is no different from the idea of legalizing domestic violence in order to control it and \"make it a little better\" and reduce harm.\n\nTo directly counteract the view of prostitution as the oppression of women, some scholars and feminists have voiced their opinion in support of prostitution and other forms of sex-work. Support is based on ideas of economic empowerment, independence and autonomy of choice, comparisons to sexual role in marriage, and challenging outdated societal notions of the proper expression of women's sexuality.\n\nActivists and scholars who are proponents of the pro-sex work position include: Margo St. James, Norma Jean Almodovar, Kamala Kempadoo, Laura María Agustín, Annie Sprinkle, Carol Leigh (also known as Scarlot Harlot), Carol Queen and Audacia Ray.\n\nTo assist women not involved in traditional “woman’s work,” pro-sex work formed to create a helpful environment for sex workers. Social activist groups like The Red Thread, founded in 1985, seek to educate the public, provide legal and medical assistance to sex workers, and help organize sex workers into groups in order to better protect themselves and to become advocates. Liberal feminists and groups such as The Red Thread, The International Committee for Prostitutes (ICPR) and COYOTE seek to ensure that sex work is seen as a valid choice that women may make without overtly oppressive forces.\n\nOne view is that sex work not only empowers women, but it provides women with greater opportunities for financial advancement.\nThe proponents of female empowerment through sex work are liberal feminists. Liberal feminists view prostitution as the sale of sex solely for economic gain, and thus it cannot be differentiated from any other sale of goods. The selling of sex ultimately consists of a buyer and a seller trying to negotiate for the best deal. Interfering in this sale of goods could not only be interfering with the rights of the buyer, but also of the seller. Women who have chosen to enter the field should not be looked down upon and should not have their choice considered to be lesser than another type of socially accepted employment. Liberal feminists argue that while prostitution and sex work may not be the ideal job for many women, it can provide a way of life and prosperity that would be otherwise unattainable. Sex work can be seen as a better alternative to working for minimum wage or working in a field that that society decided is “woman’s work.”\n\nTo conclude that all sex workers partake in the industry because of oppression, past sexual abuse, and lack of opportunity, creates a critical division in feminism and equality. Assuming that all women who chose to partake in sex work are victims of oppression violates their ability to make an autonomous choice. The autonomy theory of feminism seeks to instill in women the right to “stand on their own, make their own decisions, and pursue their own notion of a life lived well.” It cannot be ignored that some women freely chose to become sex workers not because of oppression, but because of their love for sex and desire for power.\nSex work can also create a sense of independence for women. Rather than relying on a husband or a partner, sex work allows women to make choices completely free from pressure or influence. While women are socialized to hide their sexuality, sex workers are free to explore their sexuality and to openly choose their sexual partners. Sex workers, whether they work on the streets or in hotels, have the freedom to accept or to reject clients. They are free to accept or to decline any sexual advance. This stands in direct opposition to the married housewife who does not have the sexual autonomy of the sex worker.\n\nWhereas radical feminists consider sex workers to be victims of circumstances and false consciousness, the liberal feminists and women who chose to participate in sex work do not consider themselves to be victims of any sort. Instead, they consider their actions to be liberating and providing them with a sense of control.\n\nSex work and prostitution have often been compared to a marriage in which the man is the breadwinner, while the woman stays at home and cares for the family. There does not appear to be a distinction between the woman who has devoted her body to her husband in exchange for his promise to take care of her, and the sex worker who has chosen to sell sexual acts in exchange for payment. Radical feminists and others opposed to prostitution will state that marriage and monogamy cannot be compared to prostitution because a marriage is beyond a contract, and a marriage does not advocate for the dominance of the man over the woman. However, the difference goes beyond dominance but to choice. The true difference between the dependent spouse and the sex worker is that the independent sex worker does not belong to one man; in fact, she does not belong to anyone but herself.\n\nLiberal feminists argue that the patriarchal and moralistic view of sex as the ultimate expression of a woman’s love must be changed in order for society to truly understand the sexual nature of women. A pro sex worker stance is inextricably linked to the idea of women finally not being forced to view romantic sex as the only type of sex. Notions of “proper womanhood and conventional sexuality” cannot be linked to a woman’s choice in one sexual partner or multiple, or a woman’s choice to engage in sexual intercourse in exchange for love or for money. Proper woman is a term that has its definition rooted in socialization and not fact. Prostitution and sex work are about more than the female sexual experience. Sex work can provide female empowerment and instill “a sense of self worth, self-confidence, and self esteem.” \n\nFeminists who support the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution argue that one of the significant flaws with the radical anti-prostitution feminist view is that a majority of its arguments are premised on the assumption that prostitution itself is inherently laced with sexism, classism and other unbalanced power relations. The institution of prostitution itself is seen by abolitionists as resting on these conditions and therefore they believe legalization or decriminalization will only lead to the reinforcement of these conditions. Pro-sex-work feminists argue that this assumption is flawed, and that while prostitution, as it currently exists in our society, can be misogynist or degrading in some manifestations, there is a grave danger in attributing these conditions to prostitution itself. They argue that targeting prostitution as a whole unduly focuses attention on this single institution in our society, rather than looking at society at large and the social institutions, laws and practices that lead to the subordination and oppression of women. There has been much debate over the last few decades amongst feminists about how laws relating to prostitution should be reformed. Most liberal feminists who look at prostitution from a capitalist perspective support some form of either decriminalization or legalization.\n\nDecriminalization is the removal of all penalties for prostitution itself and for all the activities necessary for prostitutes to do their work, such as advertising, communicating with clients, etc. It does not mean the reversal of \"all\" laws relating to prostitution, for example laws that exist against forcing someone into prostitution. For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word “prostitution” to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term \"criminal sexual acts\".\n\nThe term 'legalization', on the other hand, is usually used in the context of prostitution to refer to the use of criminal laws to regulate prostitution by determining the legal conditions under which prostitutes can operate. Legalization can mean anything from rigid controls under a state-controlled system to merely defining the operation of a privatized sex industry. Legalization is often accompanied by strict criminal penalties for anyone who operates outside the legally defined framework. With legalization there may be rules about where prostitution can take place (for example only in state licensed brothels), what prostitutes can do, mandatory registry/licensing and frequent mandatory health exams.\n\nSome pro-sex-worker feminists support decriminalization and some support legalization, for different reasons. Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers. They argue that decriminalization is better for the workers than legalization and that both criminalization and heavily regulated legalization infringe on the workers' safety and human rights. Many feminists who support sex workers favor decriminalization because it allows prostitutes to go into business for themselves and self-determination is a tenet of feminist politics. They believe decriminalization fosters responsibility, empowerment, self-esteem and self-care, all important feminist values. The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry.\n\nThere are many feminists whose views on prostitution do not fit in either the anti-prostitution feminist or the sex-positive feminist viewpoints, and in some cases are critical of both. These feminist authors have criticized what they see as the unproductive and often bitter debate that characterizes the two-position analysis of prostitution. Such authors highlight that in allowing arguments about prostitution to be reduced to a stale analysis and theoretical debate, feminists are themselves contributing to the marginalization of prostitutes, simplifying the nature of the work they carry out and the personal circumstances that involve each individual.\n\nFeminist scholar Laurie Shrage has also criticized the haphazard nature of feminist views on prostitution. Shrage claims that in a determination to undermine patriarchy, pro-sex feminists have advocated a reckless and \"Milton Friedman style\" deregulation of laws surrounding prostitution, without considering the implications that this may have upon women involved in sex work, particularly given the nature of the sex trade, which is more likely to be plagued by exploitation and poor working conditions, concerns that must be of importance to any feminist.\n\n\n\n"}

Federal grand juries can force people to take the witness stand, but defendants in those proceedings have Fifth Amendment privileges until they choose to answer any question. To claim the privilege for failure to answer when being interviewed by police, the interviewee must have explicitly invoked the constitutional right when declining to answer questions.\n\nThe Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause provides the right to be tried only once in federal court for the same offense. The Amendment also has a Due Process Clause (similar to the one in the 14th Amendment) as well as an implied equal protection requirement (\"Bolling v. Sharpe\", 1954). Finally, the Amendment requires that the power of eminent domain be coupled with \"just compensation\" for those whose property is taken.\n\nThe amendment as proposed by Congress in 1789 reads as follows:\n\nOn June 8, 1789, Congressman James Madison introduced several proposed constitutional amendments during a speech to the House of Representatives. His draft language that later became the Fifth Amendment was as follows:\n\nNo person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or trial for the same offense; nor shall be compelled to be a witness against himself; nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor be obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation...[E]xcept in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of war or public danger...in all crimes punishable with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury shall be an essential preliminary...\n\nThis draft was edited by Congress; all the material before the first ellipsis was placed at the end, and some of the wording was modified. After approval by Congress, the amendment was ratified by the states on December 15, 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights. Every one of the five clauses in the final amendment appeared in Madison's draft, and in their final order those clauses are the Grand Jury Clause (which Madison had placed last), the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Self Incrimination Clause, the Due Process Clause, and then the Takings Clause.\n\nThe grand jury is a pre-constitutional common law institution, and a constitutional fixture in its own right exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states to the extent that the states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. \"Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the grand jury is similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [p688] majority of the States.\" Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. Grand juries, which return indictments in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given specific instructions regarding the law by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the exclusionary rule does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments cannot be introduced in court. Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present in the grand jury room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.\nCurrently, federal law permits the trial of misdemeanors without indictments. Additionally, in trials of non-capital felonies, the prosecution may proceed without indictments if the defendants waive their Fifth Amendment right.\n\nGrand jury indictments may be amended by the prosecution only in limited circumstances. In \"Ex Parte Bain\", , the Supreme Court held that the indictment could not be changed at all by the prosecution. \"United States v. Miller\", partly reversed \"Ex parte Bain\"; now, an indictment's scope may be narrowed by the prosecution. Thus, lesser included charges may be dropped, but new charges may not be added.\n\nThe Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not protect those serving in the armed forces, whether during wartime or peacetime. Members of the state militia called up to serve with federal forces are not protected under the clause either. In \"O'Callahan v. Parker\", , the Supreme Court held that only charges relating to service may be brought against members of the militia without indictments. That decision was overturned in 1987, when the Court held that members of the militia in actual service may be tried for any offense without indictments.\n\nThe grand jury indictment clause of the Fifth Amendment has not been incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states \"do\" employ grand juries, no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish grand juries, and many (though not all) have replaced them with preliminary hearing.\n\nWhether a crime is \"infamous\", for purposes of the Grand Jury Clause, is determined by the nature of the punishment that may be imposed, not the punishment that is actually imposed; however, crimes punishable by death must be tried upon indictments. The historical origin of \"infamous crime\" comes from the \"infamia\", a punishment under Roman law by which a citizen was deprived his citizenship. In \"United States v. Moreland\", , the Supreme Court held that incarceration in a prison or penitentiary, as opposed to a correction or reformation house, attaches infamy to a crime. In \"\", , the Supreme Court judged that \"'Infamous crimes' are thus, in the most explicit words, defined to be those 'punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary.'\", while it later in \"\" , stated that \"imprisonment in a penitentiary can be imposed only if a crime is subject to imprisonment exceeding one year\". Therefore, an infamous crime is one that is punished by imprisonment for over one year. Susan Brown, a former defense attorney and Professor of Law at the University of Dayton School of Law, concluded: \"Since this is essentially the definition of a felony, infamous crimes translate as felonies.\"\n\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and multiple punishment in the same indictment. Jeopardy applies when the jury is empaneled in a jury trial, when the first witness is sworn in during a bench trial, or when a plea is rendered.\n\nThe government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal, whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury, a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury, an appellate reversal for sufficiency (except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court), or an \"implied acquittal\" via conviction of a lesser included offense. In addition, the government is barred by collateral estoppel from re-litigating against the same defense, a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal, even if the jury hung on other counts.\n\nThis principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss or other non-merits dismissal, or a directed verdict after a jury conviction, nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute. Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency, including habeas, or \"thirteenth juror\" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency on the principle that jeopardy has not \"terminated.\" There is also an exception for judicial bribery in a bench trial.\n\nIn \"Blockburger v. United States\" (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not. \"Blockburger\" is the default rule, unless the legislature intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates, as can conspiracy.\n\nThe \"Blockburger\" test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In \"Grady v. Corbin\" (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the \"Blockburger\" test was not satisfied, but \"Grady\" was overruled in \"United States v. Dixon\" (1993).\n\nThe rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in \"bad faith\", i.e., goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial. If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \"manifest necessity\" for granting the mistrial. The same standard governs mistrials granted \"sua sponte\".\n\nIn Heath v. Alabama (1985), the Supreme Court held, that the Fifth Amendment rule against double jeopardy does not prohibit two different states from separately prosecuting and convicting the same individual for the same illegal act.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being forced to incriminate themselves. Incriminating oneself is defined as exposing oneself (or another person) to \"an accusation or charge of crime,\" or as involving oneself (or another person) \"in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof.\" The \"privilege\" against compelled self-incrimination is defined as \"the constitutional right of a person to refuse to answer questions or otherwise give testimony against himself. ... \" To \"plead the Fifth\" is to refuse to answer any question because \"the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked\" lead a claimant to possess a \"reasonable cause to apprehend danger from a direct answer\", believing that \"a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result.\"\n\nHistorically, the legal protection against compelled self-incrimination was directly related to the question of torture for extracting information and confessions.\n\nThe legal shift away from widespread use of torture and forced confession dates to turmoil of the late 16th and early 17th century in England. Anyone refusing to take the oath \"ex officio mero\" (confessions or swearing of innocence, usually before hearing any charges) was considered guilty. Suspected Puritans were pressed to take the oath and then reveal names of other Puritans. Coercion and torture were commonly used to compel \"cooperation.\" Puritans, who were at the time fleeing to the New World, began a practice of refusing to cooperate with interrogations. In the most famous case John Lilburne refused to take the oath in 1637. His case and his call for \"freeborn rights\" were rallying points for reforms against forced oaths, forced self-incrimination, and other kinds of coercion. Oliver Cromwell's revolution overturned the practice and incorporated protections, in response to a popular group of English citizens known as the Levellers. The Levellers presented \"The Humble Petition of Many Thousands\" to Parliament in 1647 with 13 demands, the third of which was the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases. These protections were brought to America by Puritans, and were later incorporated into the United States Constitution through the Bill of Rights.\n\nProtection against compelled self-incrimination is implicit in the Miranda rights statement, which protects the \"right to remain silent.\" This amendment is also similar to Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In other Commonwealth of Nations countries like Australia and New Zealand, the right to silence of the accused both during questioning and at trial is regarded as an important right inherited from common law, and is protected in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and in Australia through various federal and state acts and codes governing the criminal justice system.\n\nIn South African law the right to silence originating from English common law has been entrenched in Section 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"a witness may have a reasonable fear of prosecution and yet be innocent of any wrongdoing. The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\"\n\nHowever, Professor James Duane of the Regent University School of Law argues that the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision in \"Salinas v. Texas\", significantly weakened the privilege, saying \"our choice to use the Fifth Amendment privilege can be used against you at trial depending exactly how and where you do it.\" \n\nIn the \"Salinas\" case, justices Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy held that \"the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not extend to defendants who simply decide to remain mute during questioning. Long-standing judicial precedent has held that any witness who desires protection against self-incrimination must explicitly claim that protection.\"\n\nJustice Thomas, siding with Alito, Roberts and Kennedy, in a separate opinion, held that, \"Salinas' Fifth Amendment privilege would not have been applicable even if invoked because the prosecutor's testimony regarding his silence did not compel Salinas to give self-incriminating testimony.\" Justice Antonin Scalia joined Thomas' opinion.\"\n\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination applies when an individual is called to testify in a legal proceeding. The Supreme Court ruled that the privilege applies whether the witness is in a federal court or, under the incorporation doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a state court, and whether the proceeding itself is criminal or civil.\n\nThe right to remain silent was asserted at grand jury or congressional hearings in the 1950s, when witnesses testifying before the House Committee on Un-American Activities or the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee claimed the right in response to questions concerning their alleged membership in the Communist Party. Under the Red Scare hysteria at the time of McCarthyism, witnesses who refused to answer the questions were accused as \"fifth amendment communists\". They lost jobs or positions in unions and other political organizations, and suffered other repercussions after \"taking the Fifth.\"\n\nSenator Joseph McCarthy (R-Wisc.) asked, \"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party,\" while he was chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Admitting to a previous Communist Party membership was not sufficient. Witnesses were also required to \"name names,\" to implicate others they knew to be Communists or who had been Communists in the past. Academy Award winning director Elia Kazan testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities that he had belonged to the Communist Party briefly in his youth. He also \"named names,\" which incurred enmity of many in Hollywood. Other entertainers such as Zero Mostel found themselves on a Hollywood blacklist after taking the Fifth, and were unable to find work for a while in show business. Pleading the Fifth in response to such questions was held inapplicable, since being a Communist itself was not a crime.\n\nThe amendment has also been used by defendants and witnesses in criminal cases involving the American Mafia.\n\nThe privilege against self-incrimination does not protect an individual from being suspended from membership in a non-governmental, self-regulatory organization (SRO), such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where the individual refuses to answer questions posed by the SRO. An SRO itself is not a court of law, and cannot send a person to jail. SROs, such as the NYSE and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), are generally not considered to be state actors. See \"United States v. Solomon\", \"D. L. Cromwell Invs., Inc. v. NASD Regulation, Inc.\", and \"Marchiano v. NASD\". SROs also lack subpoena powers. They rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the threat of loss of membership or a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD) when the individual asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. If a person chooses to provide statements in testimony to the SRO, the SRO may provide information about those statements to law enforcement agencies, who may then use the statements in a prosecution of the individual.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment limits the use of evidence obtained illegally by law enforcement officers. Originally, at common law, even a confession obtained by torture was admissible. However, by the eighteenth century, common law in England provided that coerced confessions were inadmissible. The common law rule was incorporated into American law by the courts. The Supreme Court has repeatedly overruled convictions based on such confessions, in cases such as \"Brown v. Mississippi\", .\n\nLaw enforcement responded by switching to more subtle techniques, but the courts held that such techniques, even if they do not involve physical torture, may render a confession involuntary and inadmissible. In \"Chambers v. Florida\" (1940) the Court held a confession obtained after five days of prolonged questioning, during which time the defendant was held incommunicado, to be coerced. In \"Ashcraft v. Tennessee\" (1944), the suspect had been interrogated continuously for thirty-six hours under electric lights. In \"Haynes v. Washington\", the Court held that an \"unfair and inherently coercive context\" including a prolonged interrogation rendered a confession inadmissible.\n\n\"Miranda v. Arizona\" (1966) was a landmark case involving confessions. Ernesto Miranda had signed a statement confessing to the crime, but the Supreme Court held that the confession was inadmissible because the defendant had not been advised of his rights.\n\nThe Court held \"the prosecution may not use statements ... stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. Custodial interrogation is initiated by law enforcement after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of movement before being questioned as to the specifics of the crime.\n\nAs for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required. Before any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\" The warning to which Chief Justice Earl Warren referred is now called the Miranda warning, and it is customarily delivered by the police to an individual before questioning.\n\n\"Miranda\" has been clarified by several further Supreme Court rulings. For the warning to be necessary, the questioning must be conducted under \"custodial\" circumstances. A person detained in jail or under arrest is, of course, deemed to be in police custody. Alternatively, a person who is under the \"reasonable belief\" that he may not freely leave from the restraint of law enforcement is also deemed to be in \"custody.\" That determination of \"reasonableness\" is based on a totality of the objective circumstances. A mere presence at a police station may not be sufficient, but neither is such a presence required. Traffic stops are not deemed custodial. The Court has ruled that age can be an objective factor. In \"Yarborough v. Alvarado\" (2004), the Court held that \"a state-court decision that failed to mention a 17-year-old's age as part of the Miranda custody analysis was not objectively unreasonable\". In her concurring opinion Justice O'Connor wrote that a suspect's age may indeed \"be relevant to the 'custody' inquiry\"; the Court did not find it relevant in the specific case of \"Alvarado\". The Court affirmed that age could be a relevant and objective factor in \"J.D.B. v. North Carolina\" where they ruled that \"so long as the child's age was known to the officer at the time of police questioning, or would have been objectively apparent to a reasonable officer, its inclusion in the custody analysis is consistent with the objective nature of that test\".\n\nThe questioning does not have to be explicit to trigger Miranda rights. For example, two police officers engaging in a conversation designed to elicit an incriminating statement from a suspect would constitute questioning. A person may choose to waive his Miranda rights, but the prosecution has the burden of showing that such a waiver was actually made.\n\nA confession not preceded by a Miranda warning where one was necessary cannot be admitted as evidence against the confessing party in a judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court, however, has held that if a defendant voluntarily testifies at the trial that he did not commit the crime, his confession may be introduced to challenge his credibility, to \"impeach\" the witness, even if it had been obtained without the warning.\n\nIn \"Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada\" (2004), the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that being required to identify oneself to police under states' stop and identify statutes is not an unreasonable search or seizure, and is not necessarily self-incrimination.\n\nIn June 2010, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Berghuis v. Thompkins\" that a criminal suspect must now invoke the right to remain silent unambiguously. Unless and until the suspect actually states that he is relying on that right, police may continue to interact with (or question) him, and any voluntary statement he makes can be used in court. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked those rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply, even after lengthy silence, can be construed as implying a waiver. The new rule will defer to police in cases where the suspect fails to assert the right to remain silent. This standard was extended in \"Salinas v. Texas\" in 2013 to cases where individuals not in custody who volunteer to answer officers' questions and who are not told their Miranda rights. The Court stated that there was no \"ritualistic formula\" necessary to assert this right, but that a person could not do so \"by simply standing mute.\"\n\nUnder the Act of Production Doctrine, the act of an individual in producing documents or materials (e.g., in response to a subpoena) may have a \"testimonial aspect\" for purposes of the individual's right to assert the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to the extent that the individual's act of production provides information not already in the hands of law enforcement personnel about the (1) existence; (2) custody; or (3) authenticity, of the documents or materials produced. See \"United States v. Hubbell\". In \"Boyd v. United States\", the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"It is equivalent to a compulsory production of papers to make the nonproduction of them a confession of the allegations which it is pretended they will prove\".\n\nCorporations may also be compelled to maintain and turn over records; the Supreme Court has held that the Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination extend only to \"natural persons.\" The Court has also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to produce corporate documents \"even\" if the act of production would incriminate him personally. The only limitation on this rule is that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him, but the jury is still allowed to draw adverse inferences from the content of the documents combined with the position of the custodian in the corporation.\n\nIn \"Griffin v. California\" (1965), the Supreme Court ruled that a prosecutor may not ask the jury to draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's refusal to testify in his own defense. The Court overturned as unconstitutional under the federal constitution a provision of the California state constitution that explicitly granted such power to prosecutors.\n\nWhile defendants are entitled to assert the right against compelled self-incrimination in a civil court case, there are consequences to the assertion of the right in such an action.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that \"the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.\" \"Baxter v. Palmigiano\", \"[A]s Mr. Justice Brandeis declared, speaking for a unanimous court in the \"Tod\" case, 'Silence is often evidence of the most persuasive character.'\" \"'Failure to contest an assertion ... is considered evidence of acquiescence ... if it would have been natural under the circumstances to object to the assertion in question.'\"\n\nIn \"Baxter\", the state was entitled to an adverse inference against Palmigiano because of the evidence against him and his assertion of the Fifth Amendment right.\n\nSome civil cases are considered \"criminal cases\" for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment. In \"Boyd v. United States\", the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \"A proceeding to forfeit a person's goods for an offence against the laws, though civil in form, and whether in rem or in personam, is a \"criminal case\" within the meaning of that part of the Fifth Amendment which declares that no person \"shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.\"\n\nIn some cases, individuals may be legally required to file reports that call for information that may be used against them in criminal cases. In \"United States v. Sullivan\", the United States Supreme Court ruled that a taxpayer could not invoke the Fifth Amendment's protections as the basis for refusing to file a required federal income tax return. The Court stated: \"If the form of return provided called for answers that the defendant was protected from making[,] he could have raised the objection in the return, but could not on that account refuse to make any return at all. We are not called on to decide what, if anything, he might have withheld.\"\n\nIn \"Garner v. United States\", the defendant was convicted of crimes involving a conspiracy to \"fix\" sporting contests and to transmit illegal bets. During the trial the prosecutor introduced, as evidence, the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for various years. In one return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be \"professional gambler.\" In various returns the taxpayer had reported income from \"gambling\" or \"wagering.\" The prosecution used this to help contradict the taxpayer's argument that his involvement was innocent. The taxpayer tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax returns as evidence, arguing that since the taxpayer was legally required to report the illegal income on the returns, he was being compelled to be a witness against himself. The Supreme Court agreed that he was legally required to report the illegal income on the returns, but ruled that the right against self-incrimination still did not apply. The Court stated that \"if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the right, the Government has not 'compelled' him to incriminate himself.\"\n\n\"Sullivan\" and \"Garner\" are viewed as standing, in tandem, for the proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income, but might validly claim the right by labeling the item \"Fifth Amendment\" (instead of \"illegal gambling income,\" \"illegal drug sales,\" etc.) The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has stated: \"Although the source of income might be privileged, the amount must be reported.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated: \". ... the \"amount\" of a taxpayer's income is not privileged even though the \"source\" of income may be, and Fifth Amendment rights can be exercised in compliance with the tax laws \"by simply listing his alleged ill-gotten gains in the space provided for 'miscellaneous' income on his tax form.\" In another case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stated: \"While the \"source\" of some of [the defendant] Johnson's income may have been privileged, assuming that the jury believed his uncorroborated testimony that he had illegal dealings in gold in 1970 and 1971, the \"amount\" of his income was not privileged and he was required to pay taxes on it.\" In 1979, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated: \"A careful reading of \"Sullivan\" and \"Garner\", therefore, is that the self-incrimination privilege can be employed to protect the taxpayer from revealing the information as to an illegal source of income, but does not protect him from disclosing the amount of his income.\"\n\nIf the government gives an individual immunity, then that individual may be compelled to testify. Immunity may be \"transactional immunity\" or \"use immunity\"; in the former, the witness is immune from prosecution for offenses related to the testimony; in the latter, the witness may be prosecuted, but his testimony may not be used against him. In \"Kastigar v. United States\", the Supreme Court held that the government need only grant use immunity to compel testimony. The use immunity, however, must extend not only to the testimony made by the witness, but also to all evidence derived therefrom. This scenario most commonly arises in cases related to organized crime.\n\nA statutorily required record-keeping system may go too far such that it implicates a record-keeper's right against self-incrimination. A three part test laid out by \"Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board\", is used to determine this: 1. the law targets a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities; 2. the activities sought to be regulated are already permeated with criminal statutes as opposed to essentially being non-criminal and largely regulatory; and 3. the disclosure compelled creates a likelihood of prosecution and is used against the record-keeper. In this case, the Supreme Court struck down an order by the Subversive Activities Control Board requiring members of the Communist Party to register with the government and upheld an assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, on the grounds that statute under which the order had been issued was \"directed at a highly selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.\"\n\nIn \"Leary v. United States\", the court struck down the Marijuana Tax Act because its record keeping statute required self-incrimination.\n\nIn \"Haynes v. United States\", the Supreme Court ruled that, because convicted felons are prohibited from owning firearms, requiring felons to register any firearms they owned constituted a form of self-incrimination and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\nWhile no such case has yet arisen, the Supreme Court has indicated that a respondent cannot be compelled to turn over \"the contents of his own mind\", e.g. he cannot be compelled to reveal the password to a bank account if doing so would prove the existence of the bank account under his control.\n\nLower courts have given conflicting decisions on whether forced disclosure of computer passwords is a violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nIn \"In re Boucher\" (2009), the US District Court of Vermont ruled that the Fifth Amendment might protect a defendant from having to reveal an encryption password, or even the existence of one, if the production of that password could be deemed a self-incriminating \"act\" under the Fifth Amendment. In \"Boucher\", production of the unencrypted drive was deemed not to be a self-incriminating act, as the government already had sufficient evidence to tie the encrypted data to the defendant.\n\nIn January 2012 a federal judge in Denver ruled that a bank-fraud suspect was required to give an unencrypted copy of a laptop hard drive to prosecutors. However, in February 2012 the Eleventh Circuit ruled otherwise - finding that requiring a defendant to produce an encrypted drive's password would violate the Constitution, becoming the first federal circuit court to rule on the issue. In April 2013, a District Court magistrate judge in Wisconsin refused to compel a suspect to provide the encryption password to his hard drive after FBI agents had unsuccessfully spent months trying to decrypt the data.\n\nAs a condition of employment, workers may be required to answer their employer's narrowly defined questions regarding conduct on the job. If an employee invokes the Garrity rule (sometimes called the Garrity Warning or Garrity Rights) before answering the questions, then the answers cannot be used in criminal prosecution of the employee. This principle was developed in \"Garrity v. New Jersey\", 385 U.S. 493 (1967). The rule is most commonly applied to public employees such as police officers.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the federal government and each state has the power of eminent domain—the power to take private property for \"public use\". The \"Takings Clause\", the last clause of the Fifth Amendment, limits the power of eminent domain by requiring that \"just compensation\" be paid if private property is taken for public use. The just compensation provision of the Fifth Amendment did not originally apply directly to the states, but since \"Chicago, B. & Q. Railroad Co. v. Chicago\" (1897), federal courts have held that the Fourteenth Amendment extended the effects of that provision to the states. The federal courts, however, have shown much deference to the determinations of Congress, and even more so to the determinations of the state legislatures, of what constitutes \"public use\". The property need not actually be used by the public; rather, it must be used or disposed of in such a manner as to benefit the public welfare or public interest. One exception that restrains the federal government is that the property must be used in exercise of a government's enumerated powers.\n\nThe owner of the property that is taken by the government must be justly compensated. When determining the amount that must be paid, the government does not need to take into account any speculative schemes in which the owner claims the property was intended to be used. Normally, the fair market value of the property determines \"just compensation\". If the property is taken before the payment is made, interest accrues (though the courts have refrained from using the term \"interest\").\n\nThe federal courts have not restrained state and local governments from seizing privately owned land for private commercial development on behalf of private developers. This was upheld on June 23, 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its opinion in \"Kelo v. City of New London.\" This 5–4 decision remains controversial. The majority opinion, by Justice Stevens, found that it was appropriate to defer to the city's decision that the development plan had a public purpose, saying that \"the city has carefully formulated a development plan that it believes will provide appreciable benefits to the community, including, but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.\" Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion observed that in this particular case the development plan was not \"of primary benefit to ... the developer\" and that if that was the case the plan might have been impermissible. In the dissent, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor argued that this decision would allow the rich to benefit at the expense of the poor, asserting that \"Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party, but the fallout from this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development firms.\" She argued that the decision eliminates \"any distinction between private and public use of property—and thereby effectively delete[s] the words 'for public use' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\". A number of states, in response to Kelo, have passed laws and/or state constitutional amendments which make it more difficult for state governments to seize private land. Takings that are not \"for public use\" are not directly covered by the doctrine, however such a taking might violate due process rights under the Fourteenth amendment, or other applicable law.\n\nThe exercise of the police power of the state resulting in a taking of private property was long held to be an exception to the requirement of government paying just compensation. However the growing trend under the various state constitution's taking clauses is to compensate innocent third parties whose property was destroyed or \"taken\" as a result of police action.\n\nThe last two words of the amendment promise \"just compensation\" for takings by the government. In \"United States v. 50 Acres of Land (1984)\", the Supreme Court wrote that \"The Court has repeatedly held that just compensation normally is to be measured by \"the market value of the property at the time of the taking contemporaneously paid in money.\" \"Olson v. United States\", 292 U.S. 246 (1934)  ... Deviation from this measure of just compensation has been required only \"when market value has been too difficult to find, or when its application would result in manifest injustice to owner or public.\" \"United States v. Commodities Trading Corp.\", 339 U.S. 121, 123 (1950)\".\n\nCivil asset forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and \"property\" such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.\n\nIn civil forfeiture, assets are seized by police based on a suspicion of wrongdoing, and without having to charge a person with specific wrongdoing, with the case being between police and the \"thing itself\", sometimes referred to by the Latin term \"in rem\", meaning \"against the property\"; the property itself is the defendant and no criminal charge against the owner is needed. If property is seized in a civil forfeiture, it is \"up to the owner to prove that his cash is clean\" and the court can weigh a defendant's use of their 5th amendment right to remain silent in their decision. In civil forfeiture, the test in most cases is whether police feel there is a preponderance of the evidence suggesting wrongdoing; in criminal forfeiture, the test is whether police feel the evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a tougher test to meet. In contrast, criminal forfeiture is a legal action brought as \"part of the criminal prosecution of a defendant\", described by the Latin term \"in personam\", meaning \"against the person\", and happens when government indicts or charges the property which is either used in connection with a crime, or derived from a crime, that is suspected of being committed by the defendant; the seized assets are temporarily held and become government property officially \"after\" an accused person has been convicted by a court of law; if the person is found to be not guilty, the seized property must be returned.\n\nNormally both civil and criminal forfeiture require involvement by the judiciary; however, there is a variant of civil forfeiture called \"administrative forfeiture\" which is essentially a civil forfeiture which does not require involvement by the judiciary, which derives its powers from the Tariff Act of 1930, and empowers police to seize banned imported merchandise, as well as things used to import or transport or store a controlled substance, money, or other property which is less than $500,000 value.\n\n\n\n"}

In Texas, the birth of the first white child is recorded in local histories on the county level. \n\nSnorri Thorfinnsson (probably born between 1005 and 1013) was the son of Thorfinnur Karlsefni and Gudrídur Þorbjarnardottir. Generally known to his contemporaries as Snorri Gudrídsson, as his mother outlived his father, was born in Vinland, making him the first European documented to be born in North America.\nMartín de Argüelles, Jr., born in the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, Florida, was the first white child known to be born in what is now the continental United States. Born in 1566, his father was a hidalgo and one of the expeditioners who went to New Spain with Captain General Pedro Menéndez de Avilés in 1565. St. Augustine, Florida, is also the oldest continuously occupied European-founded city anywhere in the United States excluding Puerto Rico.\n\nVirginia Dare, born in 1587 at the Roanoke Colony, was the first child born in North America to English parents, and her memory was celebrated in the British colonies. Peregrine White, born aboard the \"Mayflower\" at Provincetown Harbor in 1620, was the first Pilgrim birth. Sarah Rapelje, born on June 6, 1625, was the first white child born in New Netherland in what is now New York state. Born in 1659, Kristian Gaapstörm was the first white child born in New Sweden.\n\nHélène Desportes is often cited as the first white child born in New France, in what would later be Canada. She was born probably 1620, to Pierre Desportes and Françoise Langlois, although there is some disagreement about whether she was born in Quebec or before her family arrived on the continent in 1614. Hélène's maternal aunt was the mother of Eustache Martin, born in October 1621 in Quebec to Abraham Martin and Marguerite Langlois.\n\nJonathan Guy, the son of Newfoundland settler Nicholas Guy, was the first child born to Anglophone parents in Canada, and one of the first born in any part of North America within a permanent settlement. He was born on 27 March 1613 in Cuper's Cove, a settlement that has been continuously occupied since 1610 and where his family remained long after his birth\n\nAt Port Royal, Acadia in 1636, Pierre Martin and Catherine Vigneau, who had arrived on the passenger ship Saint Jehan along with 78 other migrants, were the first European parents to have a child in Acadia. The first-born child was Mathieu Martin. In part because of this distinction, Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneur of Cobequid (1699).\n\nSeebaer van Nieuwelant (born 27 July 1623), son of Willemtgen and Willem Janszoon, was born south of Dirk Hartog Island, in present-day Western Australia. His father, not to be confused with the earlier Dutch explorer of the same name, was a midshipman from Amsterdam. He and his wife were aboard the \"Leijden\", commanded by Claes Hermanszoon, which was charting the coast at the time. Their son's name in Dutch meant \"sea-born (or sea-birth) of new land\".\n\nThe first European birth in New Zealand was Thomas Holloway King at the Rangihoua Bay settlement on February 21, 1815.\n\nNovelist Joan Lindsay states that her mother-in-law, Janey Lindsay, was the first white child to be born in Fiji. She was born Jane Elizabeth Williams to the missionary Thomas Williams, and became the matriarch of an artistic family, including Daryl Lindsay (born 1889).\n\nNada Burnham (May 1894 – May 19, 1896), daughter of the celebrated American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, was the first white child born in Bulawayo and died of fever and starvation during the Siege of Bulawayo in the Second Matabele War. She was buried in the Pioneer Cemetery, plot #144, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Nada is the Zulu word for lily and she was named after the heroine in Sir H. Rider Haggard’s Zulu tale, \"Nada the Lily (1892)\". Three of Haggard's books are posthumously dedicated to her: \"The Wizard\" (1896), \"Elissa: The Doom of Zimbabwe\" (1899), and \"Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll\" (1900). Haggard's dedication reads: \"To the Memory of the Child: Nada Burnham, who \"bound all to her\" and, while her father cut his way through the hordes of the Ingobo Regiment, perished of the hardships of war at Buluwayo on 19 May 1896, I dedicate these tales—and more particularly the last, that of a Faith which triumphed over savagery and death.\"\n\nThe first white baby born in Rhodesia was named Unwin Moffat. He was the son of the missionary John Smith Moffat & his wife Emily, nee Unwin. The child was born on the 18th of December 1858. The Moffats had eleven children between 1858 and 1871. One of their sons, Howard Unwin Moffat, became premier of S. Rhodesia in 1927.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6821792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6821792", "title": "Govigama", "text": "Govigama\n\nGovi, Govigama is the largest and the most influential caste in Sri Lanka. They and the Bathgama have traditionally been responsible for cultivation in accordance with the traditional tenure system of land-holding known as Rajakariya (duty).\n\nWhile \"Govi\", meaning paddy farmer, derives from the root word \"goyam\", meaning paddy plant, \"Govigama\" originated in the Dutch era. Traditionally all land was owned by the king and the rajakriya system meant you were duty bound to work the land. Private land ownership by ordinary folk came about only after European colonisation.\n\nThe Govigama are a caste whose traditional occupation is paddy cultivation, and they were the tenant farmers in the Sri Lankan feudal system. The Sinhalese caste system was based on the service to the king or 'raja kariya', and land ownership. The monarch owned all the lands of the island and Govigama people cultivated these lands at his behest. The contribution to rice production and service in royal service gave Govigama people an important role in the ancient agrarian society. Kings are said to have participated in harvesting festivals held end of each Yala (dry) and Maha (wet) season.\n\nOnly in the present era, it has been the norm that the head of the country is a Govigama caste member, though President Premadasa was not. Some Anglican Govigama that turned Buddhist in the past century popularized the myth that the colonial occupiers, including the Portuguese, Dutch and British, tried to change Govi dominance by giving prominence to other castes by granting government posts and education under them. Yet the evidence points other wise and the post monarch colonial era saw the rise of the ordinary/majority caste populace. The Dutch and the British introduced the ideas of Republicanism.\n\nMany members of the Govigama community are still farmers in villages throughout Sri Lanka. However, some farmers other than rice farmers are not considered to be Govigama. A good example is the caste Salagama. Bathgama farmers are apparently a 'lesser' brand of rice farmer. Govigama women participate in the harvest work.\n\nAn important characteristic in the Sinhalese caste system is that the family name or the surname details the ancestry. The original name was given based on where one lived. Later, honorary terms, granted by the king based on a person's service to the kingdom, were added to the original name. This continued for generations and resulted in very long names. In general, \"Mudiyanselage\" , \"Appuhamilage\" among up country people, and \"Arachchilage\" , \"Vidanelage\" , \"Pathiranage\" among low country people, are considered to be names taken up by Govigama and others to improve their social standing, and these names were extended according to the ranking in the service of the kingdom. Further variations exist due to changes during the colonial period. Historic literature and inscriptional evidence from the feudal period show that this hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period until the collapse of Sri Lankan kingdoms and social structure under the onslaught of European colonialism. However, even in the present day, Sinhalese people look at surnames and ancestry when it comes to marriages.\n\nAs for name and religious conversions, Govigama families too became Christian and had Portuguese/Christian names (some strangely adopted during British/Dutch times) such as Don Davith (Rajapaksas), Barthlamew (Senanayakes), Ridgeway Dias (Nilaperumal/Bandaranaykes), Arnolis Dep (Wijewardane), de Sarem, de Alwis, etc. It is also why all elite Lankans of the British period be it farmer or other wise had English first names. The Goyigama also were pioneer arrack renters of the colonial era.\n\nIn traditional Sinhalese society Buddhist monks are placed at the top. Irrespective of the birth caste of a monk, even the king had to worship him. However, this led to some Buddhist sects in Sri Lanka allowing only Govigama people to join, contrary to Buddha's instructions. Other castes such as Karava, Durava, Salagama and Wahumpura have their own Buddhist sects, but they do not impose any restrictions based on caste creed or race, upon anyone who wishes to join. These practices imposed by the Govigama-only sect against the wishes of the Buddha had brought a negative reputation of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, especially when the largest Buddhist converts today are the Indian Dalit community, a practice that had also been common in the history of Buddhism. Though largely overlooked, the Govigama caste have historically incorporated south Indian migrants.\n\nAncient texts such as the \"Pujavaliya\", \"Sadharmaratnavaliya\" and \"Yogaratnakaraya\" list the four caste categories as Raja Kshatriya, Bamunu Brahmana, Velanda Vaishya, and Govi in descending order. However, the current caste system in Sri Lanka disempowers the Raja, Bamunu, and Velanda castes, and establishes the Govigama caste as the highest extant caste in the hierarchy (Govi, Karave, Durava, Salagama, etc.). The \"Pújavaliya\" also says that a Buddha could be been born into the Govi caste, although in reality he was born into the Kshatriya caste. Theravada says there is only one Buddha per human era. The 10th-century \"Dampiyaatuvagetapadaya\" and the 12th-century \"Darmapradeepikava\" already state that the Govi caste is a middle caste compared to the kings. (Dampiyaatuvagetapadaya 217. Darmapradeepikava 190), indicating gradual rise from the bottom of society.\n\nOther ancient texts such as the \"Gavaratnakaraya \" and \"Sarpothpaththiya\" (\"Sarpavedakama\" vi, 5 & 123) respectively classify even Sri Lankan cattle and snakes into the same four caste categories as Raja, Bamunu, Velanda, Govi, where again Govi is the lowest of them all. Secondary castes such as Durava and Salagama are not mentioned in these texts since they were later Dravidian migrants to Sri Lanka or small communities. However, the Govi community also has incorporated Dravidian latter migrants. Ballads sung to date at ancient Gammaduva rituals also refer to the above four castes in the same sequence and describe the limits and privileges of each. The domestic utensils of the \"Raja\" category are described as made of gold; silver and copper for the next two, and finally earthenware for the \"Govi\" caste (Gammaduwa 13).\n\nKing Nissanka Malla, who managed to chase out the Indians who destroyed the Raja, Bamunu, Welanda, and Govi castes by forced intermarriages, authored a stone inscription, \"Gal Potha\", in Polonnaruwa, which clearly states that people of Govi caste should not even think of becoming the King of Ceylon.\n\nAlthough modern writers have attempted to dismiss the above fourfold division as a mere classical division unconnected with reality, the repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British / Kandyan period Kadayimpoth – Boundary books (Abhayawardena 163 to 168) as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka’s monarchy or even further. It should be noted that no well known Karava / Salagama families existed in the Kandyan kingdom, the Govigama caste is considered as the highest caste in Sri Lanka not because of its numerical superiority, it is known as the one of the oldest cast in Sri Lanka. The \"Karava\" caste considered second in Sri Lanka was the specialist mariners/navigators also some of them are brought to Sri Lanka as Dravidian warriors throughout history, the \"Salagama\" caste has its origin in Kerala as \"Saligrama Brahmins\" who are even today considered as among the highest castes in Kerala & the \"Wahumpura\" descending from the Deva (mountain people) of the Mahavamsa. Even though ancient literature such as \"Pujavaliya\" suggests that the Buddhas might be born in Govi Kula, ancient Indians believed that Buddhas are born only in the kshatrya(Raja kula).\n\nFor the past 1.700 years the only undisputed symbol of Sri Lankan Royalty and Leadership has been the sacred Tooth Relic of Gautama Buddha. Whosoever possessed this was acknowledged as the rightful ruler of Lanka, and thus the Tooth Relic was a possession exclusive to the ruling dynasty of Sri Lanka. Upon each change of capital, a new palace was built to enshrine the Relic. Finally, in 1595 it was brought to Kandy where it is at present, in the Temple of the Tooth. However, even in the land-locked Kandyan kingdom 'Unambuwe' a son of a concubine of some considerable background was deemed not of 'royalty', hence a Telugu of royalty was imported from Madurai. This last Kandyan royal dynasty (four kings) of Nayake origin was from the Balija caste Even King Senarat Adahasin's regent, Antonio Baretto Kuruwita Rala, Prince of Ouva, was not from the Govi cast\n\nThe oldest Buddhist sect in Sri Lanka, the Siam Nikaya (established on 19 July 1753) are the custodians of the Tooth Relic, since its establishment during the Kandyan Kingdom. The Siam Nikaya uses caste-based divisions, and as of 1764 grants higher ordination only to the Radala and Govigama castes, excluding other castes from its numbers, Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti (Durawa) was the last non-Govigama monk to receive upasampada. This conspiracy festered within the Siam Nikaya itself and Moratota Dhammakkandha, Mahanayaka of Kandy, with the help of the last two Kandyan Telugu Kings victimised the low-country Mahanayaka Karatota Dhammaranma by confiscating the Sri Pada shrine and the retinue villages from the low country fraternity and appointing a rival Mahanayaka\n\nNon–Govigama representation in Parliament has steadily declined since independence and representation of non-Govigama castes are well below their population percentages. Caste representation in the Cabinet has always been limited to a few very visible, but unconcerned and disconnected members from a few leading castes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "100754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100754", "title": "Guaraní people", "text": "Guaraní people\n\nGuaraní are a group of culturally related indigenous peoples of South America. They are distinguished from the related Tupí by their use of the Guaraní language. The traditional range of the Guaraní people is in present-day Paraguay between the Uruguay River and lower Paraguay River, the Misiones Province of Argentina, southern Brazil once as far north as Rio de Janeiro, and parts of Uruguay and Bolivia. Although their demographic dominance of the region has been reduced by European colonisation and the commensurate rise of mestizos, there are contemporary Guaraní populations in these areas. Most notably, the Guaraní language, still widely spoken across traditional Guaraní homelands, is one of the two official languages in Paraguay, the other one being Spanish. The language was once looked down upon by the upper and middle classes, but it is now often regarded with pride and serves as a symbol of national distinctiveness. The Paraguayan population learns Guaraní both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. In modern Spanish, Guaraní is also applied to refer to any Paraguayan national in the same way that the French are sometimes called Gauls.\n\nThe history and meaning of the name \"Guaraní\" are subject to dispute. Prior to their encounter with Europeans, the Guaraní referred to themselves simply as \"Abá\", meaning \"men\" or \"people\". The term Guaraní was originally applied by early Jesuit missionaries to refer to natives who had accepted conversion to the Christian religion; \"Cayua\" or \"Caingua\" (\"ka'aguygua\") was used to refer to those who had refused it. \"Cayua\" is roughly translated as \"the ones from the jungle\". While the term Cayua is sometimes still used to refer to settlements of indigenous peoples who have not well integrated into the dominant society, the modern usage of the name Guaraní is generally extended to include all people of native origin regardless of societal status. Barbara Ganson writes that the name \"Guaraní\" was given by the Spanish as it means \"warrior\" in the Tupi-Guaraní dialect spoken there. \"Guarinĩ\" is attested in 12th-century Old Tupi, by Jesuit sources, as \"war, warrior, to wage war, warlord\".\n\nEarly Guaraní villages often consisted of communal houses for 10 to 15 families. Communities were united by common interest and language, and tended to form tribal groups by dialect. It is estimated that the Guaraní numbered some 400,000 people when they were first encountered by Europeans. At that time, they were sedentary and agricultural, subsisting largely on manioc, maize, wild game, and honey.\n\nEqually little is known about early Guaraní society and beliefs. They practiced a form of animistic pantheism, much of which has survived in the form of folklore and numerous myths. According to the Jesuit missionary Martin Dobrizhoffer, they practiced cannibalism at one point, perhaps as a funerary ritual, but later disposed of the dead in large jars placed inverted on the ground. Guaraní mythology is still widespread in rural Paraguay.\n\nMuch Guaraní myth and legend was compiled by the Universidad Nacional de Misiones in northern Argentina and published as \"Myths and Legends: A journey around the Guarani lands, Anthology\" in 1870 (translated into English language in 1906). Guaraní myth and legend can roughly be divided into the following broad categories:\n\n\nThe sacred Iguazu Falls hold special significance for the Guaraní and are the inspiration for numerous myths and legends. They reveal the sound of ancient battles at certain times, they are also the place where I-Yara—a malign Pomboro spirit—abducted Angá—a fair maiden—and hid her. The swallows that inhabit the falls to this day vainly search for her.\n\nIn 1537, Gonzalo de Mendoza traversed through Paraguay to about the present Brazilian frontier. On his return, he made acquaintance with the Guaraní and founded the city of Asunción, later the capital of Paraguay. The first governor of the Spanish territory of Guayrá initiated a policy of intermarriage between European men and indigenous women; the descendants of these matches characterize the Paraguayan nation today. He also initiated the enslavement of the natives.\n\nThe first two Jesuits, Father Barcena and Father Angulo, came to what is now the State of Paraná, Southern Brazil, in 1585, by land from the west. Others soon followed, and a Jesuit college was established at Asunción. In 1608, as a result of Jesuit protest against enslavement of the indigenous population, King Philip III of Spain gave authority to the Jesuits to convert and colonize the tribes of Guayrá. In the early period the name Paraguay was loosely used to designate all the basin of the river, including parts of what are now Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil.\n\nExploring expeditions were accompanied by Franciscan friars. Early in the history of Asunción, Father Luis de Bolaños translated the catechism into the Guaraní language and preached to Guaraní people who resided in the area around the settlement. In 1588–89 St. Francis Solanus crossed the Chaco wilderness from Peru and stopped at Asunción, but gave no attention to the Guaraní. His departure left the Jesuits alone with their missionary work, and to defend the natives against slave dealers. The Jesuit provincial Torres arrived in 1607, and \"immediately placed himself at the head of those who had opposed the cruelties at all times exercised over the natives\".\n\nThe center depot of the slave trade was the town of São Paulo. Originally a rendezvous place for Portuguese and Dutch pirates, it later became a refuge for criminals, who mixed with Native American and African women and actively participated in the capturing and selling of Guaranís as slaves.\n\nTo oppose these armed and organized robbers, the tribes had only their bows and arrows. Many Guaranís were slain or enslaved by the slave-hunters active in Brazil during those years.\n\nIn 1607, Spanish King Philip III sent a letter to the governor of Rio de Plata Hernandarias de Saavedra to instruct him to send the newly arrived Jesuits to begin their missionary work. With Spanish royal protection, the first Guayrá mission, Loreto, was established on the Paranapané by Father Joseph Cataldino and Father Simon Macerata in 1610. The Jesuit priest Father Ruiz de Montoya discussed the difficulties of spreading the missions and his interactions with the Guarani in his book \"The Spiritual Conquest\". Ruiz de Montoya wrote that one of the Guarani caciques Miguel Artiguaye initially refused to join the missions until threatened by another Indigenous group. Artiguaye then returned to the mission and begged for protection. As the mission provided the only real possible protection against enslavement, the Guaraní flocked there in such numbers that twelve more missions were created in rapid succession, containing in all 40,000 Guaranís. The Jesuits were seen as intermediaries between the Spanish authorities and the Guaraní caciques. The Jesuit missions needed new converts and required workers to assist in the maintenance of the missions. The Guaraní helped grow the crops to sustain the missions' populations and also produce goods to sell and trade to fund the missions.\nStimulated by this success, Father González and two companions journeyed to Uruguay and established two or three small missions in 1627. The local tribes killed the priests and the neophytes and burned the missions.\n\nSlave raiders saw the Guaraní missions as \"merely an opportunity of capturing more Indians than usual at a haul\". In 1629, an army of Paulistas surrounded the San Antonio mission, set fire to the church and other buildings, killed those who resisted or were too young or too old to travel, and carried the rest into slavery. San Miguel and Jesus Maria quickly met the same fate. Eventually, reinforcements gathered by Father Cataldino drove off the slavers. Within two years, all but two of the establishments were destroyed, and 60,000 Christian converts were carried off for sale to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The attacks usually took place on Sunday, when the whole mission population was gathered for Mass. The priests were usually spared, but several were killed.\n\nOnly a few thousand natives were left of nearly 100,000 just before the Paulista invasion. Father Antonio Ruiz de Montoya purchased 10,000 cattle, and was able to convert the natives from farmers to stock raisers. Soon under Fathers Rançoncier and Romero the Uruguay missions were re-established. In 1632 the Mamelucos discovered a new line of attack from the south. In 1638, despite some successful resistance, all twelve of the missions beyond the Uruguay were abandoned and their people consolidated with the community of the Missions Territory. In the last raid Father Alfaro was killed.\n\nIn the same year Father Montoya, after having successfully opposed the attempts of the governor and the bishop of Asunción to reduce the natives' liberties and the mission administration, sailed for Europe. On this trip he was successful in obtaining letters from Pope Urban VIII forbidding the enslavement of the missionaries under the severest church penalties, and from King Philip IV of Spain, permitting Guaranís to carry firearms for defense and to be trained in their use by veteran soldiers who had become Jesuits.\n\nWhen the next Paulista army, 800 strong, attacked the missions in 1641 they were met by a body of Christian Guaraní armed with guns on the Acaray River. In two battles, the Paulista army suffered a defeat that warded off invasions for ten years. In 1651, the war between Spain and Portugal encouraged another Paulista attack to gain territory for Portugal. Before Spanish troops could arrive to help defend the missions, the fathers themselves led a Guaraní army against the enemy. In 1732, at the time of their greatest prosperity, the Guaraní missions were guarded by a well-drilled and well-equipped army of 7,000 Guaranís. On more than one occasion this mission army, accompanied by their priests, defended the Spanish colony.\n\nIn 1732, there were 30 Guaraní missions with 141,252 converted Guaranís. Two years later a smallpox epidemic killed approximately 30,000 of them. In 1765, a second outbreak killed approximately 12,000 more, and then spread westward through the tribes of the Chaco.\n\nIn 1750, a treaty between Spain and Portugal (the Treaty of Madrid) transferred to Portugal the territory of the seven missions on the Uruguay, and the Guaranís were ordered to leave. They refused to leave, being familiar with the Portuguese as slave-hunters. Seven years of guerrilla warfare killed thousands of them (see Guarani War). The Jesuits secured a royal decree restoring the disputed mission territory to Spanish jurisdiction. Two missions in 1747 and a third in 1760 were established in the sub-tribe of the Itatines, or Tobatines, in central Paraguay, far north of the older mission group. In one of these, San Joaquín de los Tobatines (founded 1747), Martin Dobrizhoffer ministered for eight years.\n\nIn 1767, the Jesuits were expelled from Spanish dominions by royal edict. Fearing the outcome of this decision, viceroy Antonio María Bucareli y Ursúa entrusted the execution of the mandate in 1768 to two officers with a force of 500 troops. Despite their mission army of 14,000, the Jesuits submitted without resistance. Guaraní caciques from Mission San Luis wrote a letter to the Governor of Buenos Aires on February 28, 1768 to ask for the Jesuits to stay. They wrote, \"the fathers of the Company of Jesus know how to get along with us, and we with them, we are happy serving God and the King.\" The Guaraní request was denied, but the letter highlights the value of the relationship the Jesuits and Guaraní had established in the region. \n\nThe missions were turned over to priests of other orders, chiefly Franciscans, but under a code of regulations drawn up by the viceroy and modeled largely on the Jesuit system. Under a chaotic political regulation, the missions rapidly declined. Most Guaranís returned to the countryside. According to the official census of 1801, fewer than 45,000 Guaranís remained; cattle, sheep, and horses had disappeared; the fields and orchards were overgrown or cut down, and the churches were in ruins. The long period of revolutionary struggle that followed completed the destruction. In 1814, the mission Indians numbered 8,000, and in 1848 the few who remained were declared citizens.\n\nThe relationship between the Guaraní and the Jesuits sought to benefit both sides by allowing the Jesuits to grow their missionary presence in the region and giving the Guaraní protections against enslavement. This relationship changed impacted the Guaraní in the years after the Jesuit expulsion. The Guaraní left the missions but some of them didn't go back to the forest or traditional ways. Instead they became what was called \"Civilized Indians\". Catholics and educated, the Guarani used the knowledge they learned from the Jesuits and became citizens working in various professions. When Jean Baptiste Debret came to Brazil in early 19th century, he encountered and painted numerous Guaraní in Rio de Janeiro and the Southeast regions. Debret painted \"Merchants in a Street\", \"A Soldier with two well dressed ladies\", \"A Wine producer\", and \"A Rich lady and her servant going to the Church\". Debret's depicted wealthy Guaraní living in Rio when the Portuguese Royal Family resided there and it was the capital of the Portuguese Empire. This shows that they influenced and participated in the formation of Brazil as an empire and later as a nation. But their identity as Guaraní has been lost with time and forgotten by its descendants after generations.\n\nA 2018 study in \"The Quarterly Journal of Economics\" found that \"in areas of former Jesuit presence—within the Guarani area—educational attainment was higher and remains so (by 10%-15%) 250 years later. These educational differences have also translated into incomes that are 10% higher today. The identification of the positive effect of the Guarani Jesuit missions emerges after comparing them with abandoned Jesuit missions and neighboring Franciscan Guarani missions. The enduring effects observed are consistent with transmission mechanisms of structural transformation, occupational specialization, and technology adoption in agriculture.\"\n\nThe Guaraní people in Bolivia, called Chiriguanos, lived in the foothills of the Andes and had a different history than most other Guaraní people. Noted for their warlike character, the Chiriguanos were hostile in turn to the Inca Empire, the Spanish, and the independent state of Bolivia from the late 15th to the late 19th century. The Jesuit missions had little success among the Chiriguanos, although Franciscans in the 19th century attracted numerous converts. The Chririguanos were not finally pacified until the defeat in 1892 of forces led by their messianic leader Apiaguaiki Tumpa in the Battle of Kuruyuki.\n\nThe Guaraní people and culture persist. Nearly all the forest tribes on the borders of Paraguay are Guaraní. Many are descendants of mission exiles. In Paraguay, Guaraní lineage predominates in the population and the Guaraní language is spoken in most departments to this day.\n\nThe Eastern Bolivian Guaraní live in southeastern Bolivia near the Paraguayan and Argentine borders, including portions of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Tarija Departments. This region reaches nearly as far north as Santa Cruz de la Sierra and includes portions of the Guapay, Parapetí, and Ɨtɨka Guasu (or Pilcomayo) River valleys. Bolivian Guaraní are represented by the Assembly of the Guaraní People.\n\nThere are three principal subgroups of Guaraní in Bolivia, marked by dialectical and historical differences:\n\nThe Guaraní language has been much cultivated, its literature covering a wide range of subjects. Many works were written by priests, either wholly or partly in the native language, and were published by the mission press in Loreto. Among the most important treatises on the language are the \"Tesoro de la Lengua Guaraní\" (Madrid, 1639) by Father Montoya, published in Paris and Leipzig in 1876; and the \"Catecismo de la Lengua Guaraní\" of Father Diego Díaz de la Guerra (Madrid, 1630).\n\nThe language was also used in other tribes such as the Chaco in Paraguay.\n\nThe Guaraní were later described, amongst many other historical documents in existence today, in 1903 by Croatian explorers Mirko and Stjepan Seljan. Several English words can be traced to Guaraní roots, such as \"tapioca\", \"toucan\" and \"jaguar.\"\n\nPresently, the language is still the main binding characteristic of the Guaraní people. The Argentinian communities speak mainly Mbya-Guaraní, as opposed to the Tupi-Guaraní and Guaraní-Jopara spoken in Paraguay and Brazil. These varieties are mutually intelligible. The Guaraní villages located in the south of Brazil and in the north of Argentina are more marginalized due to European immigration following the First and Second World Wars. Many Guaraní do not speak Spanish and the European immigrant population does not speak Guaraní. The Mbya-Guaraní still live in secluded villages and only the \"cacique\" and some other officials in their community learn Spanish. Recently the government of Argentina has partly financed bilingual schools in the northern province of Misiones.\n\nParaguay is a bilingual country and most of its Spanish-speaking population also speaks a form of Guaraní. The Paraguayan population learns Guaraní both informally from social interaction and formally in public schools. Guaraní became part of the required curriculum in public schools during the ten years since the fall of ex-President Alfredo Stroessner in 1989. The native populations in Paraguay speak the traditional Tupi-Guaraní while the majority of bilingual Paraguayans speak Guaraní-Jopara (\"Jopara\" meaning mixed). Many words have been borrowed from Spanish but include traditional Tupi-Guaraní prefixes and suffixes. For example, \"Nde rentede pa?\" meaning \"Do you understand?\" The \"entende\" root is borrowed from the Spanish verb \"entender\" meaning \"to understand.\" The evolution of Guaraní-Jopara is very similar to \"Border Spanish\" or \"Spanglish\" where the mixture of the two languages begins to develop its own rules and uses. An understanding of both Guaraní and Spanish is required for full fluency.\n\nIn August 2009 Bolivia launched a Guaraní-language university at Kuruyuki in the southeastern province of Chuquisaca which will bear the name of the indigenous hero Apiaguaiki Tumpa. The education minister of Bolivia said that indigenous universities \"will open up not only the Western and universal world of knowledge, but the knowledge of our own identity\".\n\nThe Guaraní had a great cultural influence on the countries they inhabited. In Paraguay the name is used like an ancestral nickname (like the French being called Gauls or the Puerto Ricans being called Boricua). In Brazil there are numerous football teams named Guaraní, also there are one in Paraguay and two in Argentina (both in Misiones). The novel The Guarani is regarded as a foundational text of Brazilian Romanticism, and has been adapted twice to film. The young leader Sepé Tiaraju was immortalized by Brazilian writer Basílio da Gama in the epic poem \"O Uraguai\" (1769) and in the poem \"O Lunar de Sepé\", collected by Simões Lopes Neto and published in the beginning of the 20th century. Since then, he has been a character in many major literary works, like \"O tempo e o vento\" [\"The time and the wind\"], by Erico Verissimo. The expression and battle cry \"Esta terra tem dono!\" [This land has owners!\"] is attributed to Sepé Tiaraju.\n\nSanto Ângelo Airport, in Santo Ângelo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, is named after Sepé Tiaraju.\nInnumerable streets in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in cities like São Paulo, São Vicente and Côrdoba are named Guaraní.\nThe Guaraní are depicted in films like\" The Mission\" and \"O Tempo e o Vento\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34249574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34249574", "title": "History of cancer", "text": "History of cancer\n\nThe history of cancer describes the development of the field of oncology and its role in the history of medicine.\n\nThe earliest known descriptions of cancer appear in several papyri from Ancient Egypt. The Edwin Smith Papyrus was written around 1600 BC (possibly a fragmentary copy of a text from 2500 BC) and contains a description of cancer, as well as a procedure to remove breast tumours by cauterization.\n\nHippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC) described several kinds of cancer, referring to them by the term \"karkinos\" (\"carcinos\"), the Greek word for crab or crayfish, as well as \"carcinoma\". This comes from the appearance of the cut surface of a solid malignant tumour, with \"the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet, whence it derives its name\". Since it was against Greek tradition to open the body, Hippocrates only described and made drawings of outwardly visible tumors on the skin, nose, and breasts. Treatment was based on the humor theory of four bodily fluids (black and yellow bile, blood, and phlegm). According to the patient's humor, treatment consisted of diet, blood-letting, and/or laxatives.\nCelsus (ca. 25 BC - 50 AD) translated \"karkinos\" into \"cancer\", the Latin word for crab or crayfish.\n\nIn the 2nd century AD, the Greek physician Galen used \"oncos\" (Greek for swelling) to describe all tumours, reserving Hippocrates' term \"carcinos\" for malignant tumours. Galen also used the suffix \"\" to indicate cancerous lesions. It is from Galen's usage that we derive the modern word oncology.\n\nThrough the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body, but Hippocrates' humor-theory based treatment remained popular until the 19th century with the discovery of cells.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, it became more acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death. The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct. The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius, a follower of Descartes, believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes, and that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer. His contemporary Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads, and concluded that it was contagious.\n\nThe first cause of cancer was identified by British surgeon Percivall Pott, who discovered in 1775 that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps. The work of other individual physicians led to various insights, but when physicians started working together they could draw firmer conclusions.\n\nWith the widespread use of the microscope in the 18th century, it was discovered that the 'cancer poison' eventually spreads from the primary tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites (\"metastasis\"). This view of the disease was first formulated by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan between 1871 and 1874. The use of surgery to treat cancer had poor results due to problems with hygiene. The renowned Scottish surgeon Alexander Monro saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years. In the 19th century, asepsis improved surgical hygiene and as the survival statistics went up, surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer. With the exception of William Coley who in the late 19th century felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher \"before\" asepsis (and who injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results), cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor. The underlying cause of his results might be that infection stimulates the immune system to destroy left tumor cells. During the same period, the idea that the body was made up of various tissues, that in turn were made up of millions of cells, laid rest the humor-theories about chemical imbalances in the body.\n\nThe genetic basis of cancer was recognised in 1902 by the German zoologist Theodor Boveri, professor of zoology at Munich and later in Würzburg. He discovered a method to generate cells with multiple copies of the centrosome, a structure he discovered and named. He postulated that chromosomes were distinct and transmitted different inheritance factors. He suggested that mutations of the chromosomes could generate a cell with unlimited growth potential which could be passed on to its descendants. He proposed the existence of cell cycle check points, tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes. He speculated that cancers might be caused or promoted by radiation, physical or chemical insults or by pathogenic microorganisms.\n\nWhen Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered radiation at the end of the 19th century, they stumbled upon the first effective non-surgical cancer treatment. With radiation also came the first signs of multi-disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment. The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation, but worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients. The complications in communication this brought, along with the necessity of the patient's treatment in a hospital facility rather than at home, also created a parallel process of compiling patient data into hospital files, which in turn led to the first statistical patient studies.\n\nThe American Cancer Society was founded in 1913 by 15 physicians and businessmen in New York City under the name \"American Society for the Control of Cancer\" (\"ASCC\"). The current name was adopted in 1945.\n\nA founding paper of cancer epidemiology was the work of Janet Lane-Claypon, who published a comparative study in 1926 of 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients of the same background and lifestyle for the British Ministry of Health. Her ground-breaking work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill, who published \"Lung Cancer and Other Causes of Death In Relation to Smoking. A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors\" followed in 1956 (otherwise known as the British doctors study). Richard Doll left the London Medical Research Center (MRC), to start the Oxford unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968. With the use of computers, the unit was the first to compile large amounts of cancer data. Modern epidemiological methods are closely linked to current concepts of disease and public health policy. Over the past 50 years, great efforts have been spent on gathering data across medical practice, hospital, provincial, state, and even country boundaries to study the interdependence of environmental and cultural factors on cancer incidence.\n\nCancer patient treatment and studies were restricted to individual physicians' practices until World War II, when medical research centers discovered that there were large international differences in disease incidence. This insight drove national public health bodies to enable the compilation of health data across practices and hospitals, a process found in many countries today. The Japanese medical community observed that the bone marrow of victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was completely destroyed. They concluded that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation, and this led to the development of bone marrow transplants for leukemia. Since World War II, trends in cancer treatment are to improve on a micro-level the existing treatment methods, standardize them, and globalize them to find cures through epidemiology and international partnerships.\n\nIn 1968 Anthony Epstein, Bert Achong and Yvonne Barr identified the first human cancer virus, called the Epstein-Barr Virus.\n\nThe political 'war' on cancer began with the National Cancer Act of 1971, a United States federal law.\nThe act was intended \"to amend the Public Health Service Act so as to strengthen the National Cancer Institute in order to more effectively carry out the national effort against cancer\".\nIt was signed into law by then U.S. President Richard Nixon on December 23, 1971.\n\nIn 1973, cancer research led to a cold war incident, where co-operative samples of reported oncoviruses were discovered to be contaminated by HeLa.\n\nIn 1984, Harald zur Hausen discovered first HPV16 and then HPV18 responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers. For discovery that human papillomaviruses (HPV) cause human cancer, zur Hausen won a 2008 Nobel Prize.\n\nSince 1971 the United States has invested over $200 billion on cancer research; that total includes money invested by public and private sectors and foundations.\n\nDespite this substantial investment, the country has seen just a five percent decrease in the cancer death rate (adjusting for size and age of the population) between 1950 and 2005. Longer life expectancy may be a contributing factor to this, as cancer rates and mortality rates increases significantly with age, more than three out of five cancers are diagnosed in people aged 65 and over.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59814", "title": "If This Goes On—", "text": "If This Goes On—\n\n\"If This Goes On—\" is a science fiction novella by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first serialized in 1940 in \"Astounding Science-Fiction\" and revised and expanded for inclusion in the 1953 collection \"Revolt in 2100\". The novella shows what might happen to Christianity in the United States given mass communications, applied psychology, and a hysterical populace. The novel is part of Heinlein's \"Future History\" series.\n\nIn 2016 the story won the 1941 Retro-Hugo Award for Best Novella of 1940 at the 2016 WorldCon.\n\nThe story is set in a future theocratic American society, ruled by the latest in a series of fundamentalist Christian \"Prophets\". The First Prophet was Nehemiah Scudder, a backwoods preacher turned President (elected in 2012), then dictator (no elections were held in 2016 or later).\n\nJohn Lyle, a junior army officer under the Prophet, is stationed at the Prophet's capital of New Jerusalem. Devout at this point, he finds himself questioning his faith when he falls for one of the Prophet's Virgins, Sister Judith. Judith, new to the vocation, faints when she is called upon to render sexual service to the Prophet and is confined to her quarters until she sees the light. John confides in his far more worldly roommate, Zeb Jones, who is not only not shocked, but who assists John. A clandestine meeting with Judith goes awry when they are forced to kill a spy, leaving them no choice but to seek aid from the Cabal, an underground revolutionary movement (Judith's friend, Sister Magdalene, is a member). The two men are inducted into the Cabal, while remaining on duty in their army posts. Judith is arrested and tortured as part of the investigation into the death of the spy, and John and Zeb rescue her, though leaving enough clues that John is soon arrested and tortured himself. He gives little away, and is himself rescued by the Cabal. Zeb and Magdalene have evaded arrest, thanks to a clandestine distress signal that John manages to leave for Zeb while being arrested.\n\nJudith is spirited out of the country before John regains consciousness, and John is given a false identity in order to make his way to Cabal headquarters. He is detected en route, forced to flee, and arrives safely after several misadventures. He finds that Zeb and Magdalene, who he assumes are a couple, have made their way there before him. All take on significant roles in bringing to fruition the revolutionary plot, John as an aide to the commander, General Huxley.\n\nWhile working there, John receives a literal \"Dear John\" letter from Judith, informing him of her impending marriage to a Mexican man she met while getting refuge in his country. He learns that Zeb and Magdalene have no marriage plans, and begins a romance with Magdalene.\n\nThe revolutionary plot is mostly successful, and the country, other than New Jerusalem, is seized. But the capital must also be conquered lest it serve as a rallying point for loyalists. Even as constitutional discussions go on, tempered to provide the greatest possible individual freedom (this is the origin of the 'Covenant' mentioned in other Heinlein works), the new regime's troops prepare to take New Jerusalem. John and Magdalene are married just before the assault.\n\nDuring the fight, Huxley is wounded, and John must take over temporary command, though not entitled by rank to do so. He gives the orders that bring victory. He then turns over command to the senior unwounded general, and leads a squad invading the Prophet's private quarters. They find that he has been viciously killed by his own Virgins.\n\nThe Cabal uses terminology associated with Freemasonry, and there are hints that the Masons are actually one of the groups involved in the loosely organized revolt against the government. (Heinlein himself was not a Mason, but had considered joining the Masons as a young man.)\n\nDamon Knight wrote of the novel:\n\nRevolution...has always been a favorite theme in science fiction. It's romantic, it's reliable, and—as a rule—it's as phony as a Martian princess.\n\nWho but Heinlein ever pointed out, as he does here in detail, that a modern revolution is big business? And who but Heinlein would have seen that fraternal organizations, for thirty years the butt of highbrow American humor, would make the perfect nucleus for an American underground against tyranny?\n\nWhile set in Heinlein's \"Future History\", the story is self-contained and has little connection with other works in the series. However, it is noted in \"Methuselah's Children\" that, during the time of this story, the secret of the Howard Families was held close (being a prize that was beyond the power of the Prophet to confiscate), and also that the Cabal assisted in helping the Howards maintain their Masquerade, the concealment of the existence of the Howards. Lazarus Long specifically mentions that he spent the period of the Interregnum, when the Prophets ruled the United States and space travel was forbidden, mostly on Venus.\n\nThe story also depicts the start of the negotiations which would lead to the Covenant, the somewhat idealized basis for government depicted in \"Coventry\", \"Misfit\" and in \"Methuselah's Children\".\n\nScudder was previously mentioned in passing in the short story \"Logic of Empire\" and later on in Heinlein’s final novel \"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\". A story about the rise of Scudder, \"The Sound of His Wings\", is contained in the Future History timeline, but was never written by Heinlein, who stated in the afterword to \"Revolt in 2100\": \"I will probably never write the story of Nehemiah Scudder, I dislike him too much\". Also, a story called \"The Stone Pillow\", which would have depicted the earlier foredoomed opposition to the Theocracy, never got written, Heinlein noting that there was \"too much tragedy in real life\".\n\nThe 1940 version of \"If This Goes On—\" was believed to be Heinlein's first novel until the unpublished work \"\" was discovered in 2003. However, in the earlier, unpublished novel Scudder, though coming very close to gaining power, is stopped at the last moment by the mobilization of Libertarians.\n\nWard Carson wrote: \"In \"For Us, The Living\", space colonization waits until the end of the Twenty-First Century and Scudder is defeated; in the \"Future History\" it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US. Heinlein made no explicit remark on this, but a causal connection could be made: in the Future History the bold individualistic Americans emigrated into space in the end of the Twentieth Century, and were not present in America to stop it from falling into the fanatic's hands\".\n\n"}

{"id": "47731689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47731689", "title": "Kevin Folta", "text": "Kevin Folta\n\nKevin M. Folta is a professor and chairman of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida. From 2007 to 2010 he helped lead the project to sequence the strawberry genome, and continues to research photomorphogenesis in plants and compounds responsible for flavor in strawberries. Folta has been active as a science communicator since 2002, especially relating to biotechnology. He has faced controversy over what his critics say are his industry connections. In 2017 he was elected as a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\nFolta received his B.S. and M.S. in biology in 1989 and 1992, respectively, from Northern Illinois University, and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Chicago in molecular biology in 1998. He completed postdoctoral research at the University of Wisconsin, and joined the faculty of the horticulture department at the University of Florida in 2002. He assumed the role of Interim Department Chair in 2012 and became the Chair in 2013.\n\n\nFolta's laboratory has two primary research areas: controlling plant traits using light, and using genomics to identify molecular markers for key fruit-plant traits.\n\nFolta's work with light began in 1987, while working with genes associated with the phytochrome response in plants. This research resulted in the discovery that exposure to blue light mediates specific gene responses and physiology in the plant \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" through cryptochrome and phototropin receptors.\n\nSince then, Folta has continued this work to explore new findings in how plants grow and move in green-enriched environments, which are the challenging conditions in which plants have to grow while under the shade of other plants, and the unusual effects this produces. His work in plant biology would later extend to using light emitting diodes (LEDs) to control specific attributes of plants, such as quality, flavor, aroma, nutrition, and texture. On this, Folta says that each plant's genetic makeup gives it a certain genetic potential that can be altered by selection or genetic modification, but how this potential is reached depends on environmental conditions that can be manipulated through photomorphogenesis. He says this depends entirely on how genes that are responsible for controlling the plant's growth are activated or deactivated in response to light.\n\nFolta believes this research would be of interest to farmers wanting to get the most genetic potential out of their crops without the need for chemicals or genetic modification, and he believes his research involving red and far-red light could be used on postharvest fruits to improve their flavor while stored in grocery stores and home refrigerators.\n\nFolta's work in strawberry genomics began in 2002. Folta was the contributing author in sequencing the strawberry genome in 2011. During the project, they discovered molecular markers that speed traditional breeding for enhanced flavors.\n\nFolta's more recent work with strawberries has involved identifying the compounds responsible for taste that are present in different varieties of the fruit in order to breed these characteristics back into commercial varieties; characteristics which have been lost over time due to strawberries having been bred, traditionally, to select for disease resistance, firmness, size, and yield instead of flavor. As a result of this research, his team has identified 30 compounds present in strawberries that affect its flavor, including some that resemble other fruits such as grapes and pineapples, and 6 associated with a human's perception of sweetness. These findings can also be used for other staple plants in the rose family such as peaches, almonds, apples, raspberries, and blackberries, and contribute to a growing list of compounds that can be used in the future to produce more flavorful foods without using as much sugar. Folta's research can be used to produce more flavorful and aromatic strawberries using conventional breeding techniques, without the use of genetic modification.\n\nFolta has formal training in communication and has been recognized for his skill by scholarly institutions. He uses his experience to provide workshops to teach scientists and farmers how to communicate science effectively, and engages with the public through outreach programs, the internet, and other means.\n\n\"Nature Biotechnology\" described Folta as \"a gifted communicator—one of the rare scientists who has engaged the public, with over 12 years experience behind him. Not someone who merely discusses public engagement; but someone who actually communicates directly with non-expert audiences—at science fairs, in schools, at retirement homes, in blogs and podcasts.\"\n\nIn 2016, Folta was awarded the Borlaug CAST Communication Award by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST), named after fellow agricultural biologist and 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug. CAST cited Folta's ability to focus on \"clear, credible information\" and his use of multiple venues to engage the public, in addition to his communication workshops for scientists and farmers. Julie Borlaug, daughter of Norman Borlaug, added, \"[Folta] has not shied away from controversial subjects and has often been the number one target of the anti-science movement on behalf of all of us who support biotechnology.\" Writing about the award in \"The Des Moines Register\", Jack Payne, University of Florida's senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources and leader of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, praised Folta for his dedication to science communication and willingness to speak to all audiences about food biotechnology. Payne wrote that Folta \"wants to replace fear with fact\" to counteract misinformation about biotechnology and its use in food production.\n\nFolta has considered his outreach efforts among his proudest achievements, and stated that his most important contributions to science \"won't come out of my lab. They'll come out of my mouth.\"\n\nFolta has been active in the public discussion of politically controversial topics such as evolution, climate change, vaccines, and agricultural biotechnology since 2002. He views a disconnect between science and the public's understanding, and believes a priority should be given to increase public awareness and \"give scientists the tools to effectively participate at that interface.\" He believes that communication between scientists and the public is increasingly important: \"In 2050, we will look back at this age as a time when our command of biology changed. From being able to manipulate viruses to attack cancer, to precision-change genetic information in a cell, to tweaking a gene and making a crop immune to a disease—breakthroughs like this are real and gaining momentum.\"\n\nHe has compared the scientific consensus regarding the safety of genetically modified foods to those regarding global warming and vaccines. He is an outspoken critic of food blogger Vani Hari's claims about the alleged dangers of certain food additives that regulators generally recognize as safe. Folta advocates for a \"soft and effective\" approach in handling anti-GMO activists, believing overly inflammatory responses from the scientific community will alienate the public audience. Folta regards the term \"GMO\" as imprecise and not as descriptive as the term \"genetic engineering\". His supportive view is also expressed in an interview at CSICon made by Jonathan Jarry, recalling Kevin Folta's recent visit to Uganda where he saw Ugandan scientists using genetic engineering to solve a food crisis, although initially being denied the use of this technology. \n\nAs an example of the importance of public education, Folta says of the changes in crop technology: \"Gene editing is this method of changing a single base (or maybe a few bases) of targeted DNA in an amazingly precise way. And unlike the old methods of genetic engineering that left some of the hardware of the process in the cell, the new methods can yield tiny alterations that solve a problem with a precision change. While scientists celebrate the technology and see it as a way to precision-breed new plants and animals, activists call it the most 'dangerous and insidious form of screwing with nature known to man'.\"\n\nFolta operates the \"Talking Biotech\" podcast which is billed as \"A science-based assessment of new technology and the future of food\", in which he interviews agriculture scientists and experts in the fields of science and communication to discuss the genetic improvement of plants, animals, and microbes and other issues in biotechnology.\n\nHe has also created the \"Science Power Hour\" podcast, which is a parody of an AM talk radio show hosted by Folta's alter ego \"Vern Blazek\". Folta describes the show as an attempt to deliver science communication in an entertaining way that would appeal to a more general audience, and as a way to convey serious topics using humor.\n\nKevin Folta has been a guest on numerous other podcasts such as \"Talk Nerdy\", \"Heartland Daily Podcast\", \"Food and Farm\", \"Science for the People\", \"Vegan Chicago\", \"The Joe Rogan Experience\", and \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\".\n\nIn February 2015, US Right to Know (USRTK), an Oakland, California-based group whose sole major funder is the Organic Consumers Association, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the University of Florida as part of a campaign targeting the emails of public scientists who have spoken out in favor of biotechnology. USRTK was concerned that scientists such as Folta may have been pressured by food and agricultural companies into claiming that GMOs are safe. The university released documents which indicated that Folta had not committed any scientific misconduct. Folta told \"Science\" that he was willing to comply, but was concerned with how USRTK would use the information and how his emails could be taken out of context and used to \"smear\" him.\n\nIn a \"Nature\" article from August 2015 Keith Kloor wrote that Folta had \"close ties to Monsanto and other biotechnology interests\". Folta denied these claims, and wrote that the accusation was based on a few dozen emails, three professional direct interactions over thirteen years, and a reimbursement of customary travel expenses by Monsanto for $719.76, covering airfare, a rental car, 2 hotel nights, and parking for one event to speak to farmers in Colorado in September 2014. Folta has maintained that he has always communicated information consistently according to his research and understanding as a scientist working for a public institution.\n\nIn September 2015, Eric Lipton writing for the \"New York Times\" reported that the agriculture industry had enlisted academics, including Folta, to use their \"independent voices\" to advocate for public perception and policy, which appeared favorable to the industry. He reported that the University of Florida had received a $25,000 grant from Monsanto to be used at the university's discretion which was earmarked for an established biotechnology communication program. Folta submitted expense reports to use the biotechnology communication fund to pay for travel expenses, a small projector, coffee and food. Most of these expenses had since been reimbursed to the fund with honoraria from his talks and private donations from individuals and small businesses, while none of the donation from Monsanto was used. In response to the controversy and personal threats against Folta and his family, the university offered to return the donation, which Monsanto refused; instead, funds were redirected to a university food pantry. Folta has promised a complete accounting for his research and extension activities, which he says \"defines a new standard of transparency and a new tool to cultivate trust\" he hopes other scientists and advocates will adopt.\n\nIn October 2015, \"Nature Biotechnology\" wrote that scientists like Folta have been \"targeted because they speak inconvenient truths about GM technology\" and stated that the funds \"were tied neither to [Folta] directly nor to his research. His conflict of interest disclosures were wholly compliant with his university's rules. He never used industry funds for personal gain.\" The journal criticized the journalists for \"cherry-picking\" and creating \"hostile environments [for scientists] that threaten vibrant rare species with extinction.\"\n\nMany experts were highly critical of the move by USRTK. Jack Payne, head of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, characterized this as an example of activist groups attempting to silence scientists who wish to engage in public discussion of politically controversial topics, describing it as a \"spiral of silence\". Gretchen Goldman, writing for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), a nonprofit science advocacy organization, criticized the FOIA requests for being \"overly wide\", saying it would create \"chilling effects on researchers and confuse the public about the state of the science.\" Nina Fedoroff, Peter Raven, and Phillip Sharp, three former presidents of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote in \"The Guardian\" comparing the USRTK's use of FOIA against scientists to \"Climategate\" and criticized the organization backing them for \"promoting the interests of the organic food business\", calling their activities \"anti-science\".

The campaign, which is led by parents and traces its origins to a thread on the on-line forum Mumsnet, is a spin-off of the Let Toys be Toys campaign, which seeks to get toy manufactures to stop gendering their products.\n\nIn its founding statement, the campaign said: “Children are listening, and take seriously the messages they receive from books, from toys, from marketing and the adults around them. Do we really want them to believe that certain things are off-limits for them because of their gender? They’re not ‘getting it wrong’ if a girl likes robots, or if a boy wants to doodle flowers. […] It’s time that publishers Let Books Be Books and leave children free to choose their interests for themselves”.\n\nProminent authors supporting the Let Books Be Books campaign include former and current children's laureates Anne Fine and Malorie Blackman, the poet laureate Carol-Ann Duffy, and Philip Pullman. \n\nAnne Fine told UK newspaper \"The Guardian\": \"You'd think this battle would have been won decades ago. But even some seemingly bright and observant adults are buying into it again […] There are girls of all sorts, with all interests, and boys of all sorts with all interests. Just meeting a few children should make that obvious enough. But no, these idiotic notions are spouted so often they become a self-fulfilling societal straitjacket from which all our children suffer\". \n\nAlso speaking to \"The Guardian\", Pullman, author of the \"His Dark Materials\" trilogy, said: \"I'm against anything, from age-ranging to pinking and blueing, whose effect is to shut the door in the face of children who might enjoy coming in. No publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the book would prefer. Let the readers decide for themselves\".\n\nIn the week following the campaign's launch, Parragon Books responded on Twitter, tweeting: \"Feedback on gender-specific titles is important to us. We have no plans to create new titles referring to boy/girl in the UK\". In the same week, publisher Usborne announced that a plan to \"discontinue publication of titles such as these was decided some time ago”, adding that the company took \"feedback on gender-specific titles very seriously” and that it had \"no plans to produce any titles labelled 'for girls' or 'for boys' in the future\".\n\nOn Sunday 16 March, the literary editor of the UK newspaper the \"Independent on Sunday\", Katy Guest, announced: ”Gender-specific books demean all our children. […] So I promise now that the newspaper and this website will not be reviewing any book which is explicitly aimed at just girls, or just boys. Nor will \"The Independent’\"s books section. And nor will the children’s books blog at independent.co.uk”.\n\nHowever, Michael O'Mara, owner of Buster Books defended his company’s gender-specific titles, such as \"The Beautiful Girls' Colouring Book\" and \"The Brilliant Boys' Colouring Book\", to \"The Independent on Sunday\" in March 2014, saying: ”It's a fact of life how a very large percentage of people shop when buying for kids, do it by sex. We know for a fact that when they are shopping on Amazon, they quite often type in 'books for boys' and 'books for girls’”.\n\nIn November 2014, Ladybird Books signed up to the Let Books Be Books campaign and announced that it was \"committed\" to avoiding gendered titles and would be removing such labelling in reprinted copies. The publisher added: \"Out of literally hundreds of titles currently in print, we actually only have six titles with this kind of titling\". Its parent company, Penguin Random House Children’s division, will also be following suit.\n\nOther publishers who have informed Let Books Be Books that they will no longer be publishing gender-specific titles include Dorling Kindersley, Chad Valley and Miles Kelly Publishing.\n\n\n"}

In Southern Africa they first settled in the Goha Hills of Botswana. Due to the tribal conflicts in Botswana, they moved to the great Caprivi. In that region they erected their headquarters in Bukalo under the leadership of the first Masubia king, King Sanjo. The invasion of the Lozi of Zambia and the Kololo of South Africa between the 17th and 18th century led to the current blend of cultures, language and traditions. \n\nThey live off farming and gathering, hunting and fishing. The women are responsible for farming activities while the men deal with the hunting and fishing. Their staple food is hard porridge \"(inkoko)\" with fish or sour milk \"(masanza)\".\n\nThe Masubia villages are called \"minzi\". The homes consist of huts made up of a mud wall and thatch roof or houses with concrete walls and sheet metal roofs. The huts are surrounded by a reed fence known as \"ilapa\". The villages often consist of 15 to 30 families.. \n\nNkuhaane village names are given in accordance or with consideration to major life events that took place or were believed to have taken place in that area such as \nthe main villages of the nkuhaane people are, Ibbu, Mahundu, Vuruha, Mutikitila, Ngala, Mbalasinte, Ciseke ca banyai, Ioma, Bbwaara, Cizungwe and Iseke.\n\nMasubia religion is based on ancestor worship, wherein the deceased ancestors are regarded as guardian spirits. Those who do not honor nor show respects to these spirits are punished. They believe that these spirits have a connection with the Creator, and serve as mediators. According to the Joshua Project, forty percent of the Masubia are Christians while sixty percent practice ethnic religion.\n\nThe Masubia are well known for their vibrant cultural dances known as \"Chiperu\" and \"Chizo\" and their traditional attire, \"Musisi\". \n"}
{"id": "1708589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1708589", "title": "Miss Galaxy Pageant", "text": "Miss Galaxy Pageant\n\nThe Miss Galaxy Pageant is an annual event held in Nukualofa, Tongatapu in the Kingdom of Tonga that selects the \"best\" Fakaleiti. The event is held over a three night period and attracts crowds of up to 5000 people per night. The pageant has been operating since the mid-1990s and has become a major attraction for Tongans and tourists. Attendance by academics include Professors Niko Besnier, Heather Young-Leslie and Michael Poltorak, and international celebrities such as Pamela Stephenson, Michael Wilson and Minnie Driver.\n\nThe Miss Galaxy Pageant celebrates the creativity, diversity and talent of GLBT Fakaleiti communities in Tonga. Contestants are mostly from Tonga, but may come from the Pacific and the Tongan diaspora. Structured similarly to the Miss Heilala beauty pageant, the Miss Galaxy contest both emulates and parodies the heterosexual gender stereotypes which are showcased in the Miss Heilala and considered normative in Tongan society. As with other examples of gender-liminal celebrations, the pageant performances are often humorous, sometimes lewd and/or provocative. Thus, where the Miss Heilala serves to highlight and preserve traditional cultural ideals of femininity, and is associated strongly with a view of Tongan culture as unchanging and separate from other Pacific nations, the Miss Galaxy embraces modernity (perhaps even post-modernity) and translocality.\n\nThe word \"Fakaleiti\" literally translates as \"like a lady\". Traditionally in Tongan cultural practice, as in Samoa and other parts of Polynesia, there was recognition of men who preferred to behave like women, especially in terms of work. Weaving, barkcloth making, and other forms of creativity were feminine-gendered forms of work, and that some men gravitated to feminine behaviours was accepted. The term fakaleiti is an introduction into the Tongan language (leiti being borrowed from the English 'lady'), to describe this aspect of male gender liminality. Historically, this was not a disparaged social category. Eventually, the term Fakaleiti came to include forms of male homosexuality and eroticism, including men who prefer sex with men, as well as other transgender persons. Today, while the term \"Fakaleiti\" is used by the general population to refer to a completely feminized man who lives and works as a woman, it is not preferred by the Tongan transgender community on the grounds that it suggests \"simulating\" femininity rather that being truly feminine. Transgender persons more commonly use the term \"leiti\" to refer to themselves.\n\nThe pageant is organized by the Tongan Leiti's Association (TLA). The TLA was founded by Joleen 'Joey' Mataele, an internationally recognized celebrity and event planner based in Tonga. Joey remains as director of the event.\n\nThe Miss Galaxy pageant has enjoyed various corporate sponsors and royal patronage over the years. Recently Air New Zealand has supported the pageant, which is now formally named the Air New Zealand Galaxy Queen Beauty Pageant(MANZGQBP). Colloquially, it remains the Miss Galaxy pageant.\n\nThe Patron for the Miss Galaxy is the Honorable Salote Lupepau'u Salamasina Purea Vahine Ari'i o'e Hau Tuita, the eldest daughter of Her Royal Highness Princess Salote Mafile'o Pilolevu Tuita and her husband the Honorable Siosaia Ma'ulupekotofa Tuita. The Honourable Lupepau'u is the first grandchild of the late King of Tonga His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV and Her Majesty Queen Halaevalu Mata'aho. She is a niece to the current king, Tupou VI.\n\nThe Guest of Honour is always a Royal family member. Usually this is the Honourable Salote Lupepau'u Tuita. She also acts as patron-advisor to the Tongan Leitis Association, who are the pageant's organisers.\n\nThe Tongan Leiti's Association have a core membership of 483 local and International Tongan GLBT persons as of May 2010. A key member is Joleen 'Joey' Mataele, who is also the Pacific Island representative on the International Gay & Lesbian Association (ILGA) Executive Board and is the Chairperson of the South Pacific MSM Network Group. The TLA are active in its mainstream community as advocates for the gender-liminal, and also promote HIV/AIDS Awareness to Youth, Family and its GLBTD communities.

{"id": "23844091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23844091", "title": "Mondoweiss", "text": "Mondoweiss\n\nMondoweiss is a news website that is co-edited by journalists Philip Weiss and Adam Horowitz. It is a part of the Center for Economic Research and Social Change. According to the editors, Mondoweiss is \"a news website devoted to covering American foreign policy in the Middle East, chiefly from a progressive Jewish perspective\". Its founder describes himself as progressive and anti-Zionist.\n\nPhilip Weiss has written for \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"Harper's Magazine\", \"Esquire\", and \"The New York Observer.\" He is the author of \"Cock-a-Doodle-Doo\" (1996) and \"American Taboo: A Murder In The Peace Corps\" (2004).\n\nAdam Horowitz received his master's degree in Near Eastern Studies from New York University. He later served as the Director of the Israel/Palestine Program for the American Friends Service Committee where he gained \"extensive on-the-ground experience in Israel/Palestine\". In addition to Mondoweiss, Horowitz has written for \"The Nation\", \"Alternet\", \"The Huffington Post,\" and \"The Hill.com\". Horowitz wrote the foreword to Rabbi Brant Rosen's book \"Wrestling in the Daylight: A Rabbi's Path to Palestinian Solidarity\". He has spoken frequently on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict on campuses and to organizations.\n\nAlex Kane, an assistant editor for Mondoweiss based in New York City, also is the World editor for AlterNet. His work also has appeared in \"Salon\", \"The Daily Beast\", the \"Electronic Intifada\", \"Extra!\" and \"Common Dreams\".\n\nIn a 2010 interview with \"The Link,\" the magazine published by Americans for Middle East Understanding, Philip Weiss described the evolution of Mondoweiss:\n\nIn \"The American Conservative\", Weiss detailed his split from \"The Observer\" and wrote, \"Blogging about such matters sometimes made me feel wicked, as though I was betraying my tribe. Shouldn't some thoughts remain private? But I felt that the form demanded transparency about what I cared about, Jewish identity.\"\n\nIn 2008, after the arrest of Ben-Ami Kadish, who allegedly gave Israel stolen United States secrets on nuclear weapons, fighter jets and missiles in the 1980s, \"The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles\" quoted Mondoweiss as writing about an old Government Accountability Office report stating that Israel \"conducts the most aggressive espionage operation against the United States of any U.S. ally\".\n\nIn 2010 James Wolcott wrote in \"Vanity Fair\" quoting Weiss in Mondoweiss regarding an Anti-Defamation League statement regarding the planned Park51 project, an Islamic Center near the World Trade Center site. Wolcott quoted Weiss who had written: \"It's happened: the Anti-Defamation League has overplayed its hand (in this case, neoconservative Islamophobia) in such a glaring manner that it is being condemned at every quarter ...\"\n\nIn 2012 \"Tablet\" magazine asserted that the Associated Press had \"picked up a story from advocacy blog\" Mondoweiss, about Israeli security asking a Palestinian-American to show them her email at Ben-Gurion Airport. \"The Tablet\" wrote that the point was \"that more news stories—and this story is undoubtedly newsworthy—are going to come to the attention of non-niche journalists and thereby gain wider notice\".\n\nIn 2012, Mondoweiss revealed that United States Representative Joseph R. Pitts' office had mailed a letter calling on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestine National Authority Chair Yasser Arafat to work toward peace in the Middle East. The blog pointed out that Sharon had been in a coma since 2006 and Arafat had died in 2004. The representative blamed accidental use of an old form letter.\n\nWeiss and Horowitz, along with Lizzy Ratner, co-edited the 2011 book \"The Goldstone Report: The Legacy of the Landmark Investigation of the Gaza Conflict\". The \"Publishers Weekly\" review noted that the abridged version of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (\"the Goldstone Report\"), included an introduction by Naomi Klein and an \"eloquent\" forward by Bishop Desmond Tutu. The review said the book was \"enhanced\" by oral testimonies which \"inject a harrowing human element to counterbalance the report's dispassionate tone\". The review called the book \"An essential read for those concerned with accurate documentation of historical events and nations' accountability for their treatment of civilians living in war zones\". \"Kirkus Reviews\" called the book \"An eye-opening document and an urgent call for accountability\".\n\nIn a \"Democracy Now!\" interview Horowitz discussed Richard Goldstone's later correction of one item in his report, his saying \"Civilians were not intentionally targeted [by Israel] as a matter of policy.\" Horowitz expressed that he views this as a minor issue and \"Much larger was the issue of intentionally attacking the civilian infrastructure of Gaza, which he doesn't mention, and the idea of just disproportionate and indiscriminate violence, which he doesn't address and which affects civilians disproportionately.\"\n\nIn March 2007, Gary Kamiya in an article for the \"Salon\" website wrote that Mondoweiss offered \"informed and passionate discussions\" of what Weiss states are \"delicate and controversial matters surrounding American Jewish identity and Israel\". Kamiya also states that Weiss, \"routinely skewers attempts by mainstream Jewish organizations and pundits to lay down the law on what is acceptable discourse\". He gave as an example Weiss exploring \"off-limits\" topics like dual loyalty, as in an incident regarding the American Jewish Committee. Weiss had written that a Committee piece accusing Jewish intellectuals who did not \"toe the party line on Israel\" of being \"self-haters\" only revealed the \"anti-intellectual, vicious, omerta practices of the Jewish leadership\".\n\nIn 2009, Michael Massing, in an article titled \"The News About the Internet\" for \"The New York Review of Books\", noted that \"Weiss is one of several friends I've seen flourish online after enduring years of frustration writing for magazines. With its unrelenting criticism of Israel, his site [Mondoweiss] has angered even some of his fellow doves, but it has given voice to a strain of opinion that in the past had few chances of being heard.\"\n\nIn November 2009 former United States Senator James G. Abourezk praised Weiss and Horowitz for their courage in taking on \"what most believe is an unassailable, monolithic pro-Israel Lobby\". He wrote that the blog \"hits Israel's illegal occupation where it hurts—in the center of the American Jewish community. Mondoweiss is evidence that more and more American Jews are thinking twice about giving Israel their wholehearted, unquestioning support for the crimes it is committing in the territories it illegally occupies.\"\n\nIn September 2010, James Wolcott of \"Vanity Fair\" argued that Mondoweiss \"is one of the most invaluable sites in the blogosphere, a blast of sanity and moral suasion against the prevailing demonization of anything and anyone perceived as anti-Israel\".\n\nIn 2012 \"Arab News\" wrote that Weiss and Horowitz had \"developed an interactive forum that brims with up-to-the-minute news and comment and makes brilliant attention-grabbing use of text and video material\" and that \"they bring to their work a moral and intellectual verve woefully missing from coverage of Palestine-Israel issues in even the more respected sections of the mainstream media\".\n\nWhile Mondoweiss has received praise for its content, it has s also been criticized, much of which has come from people and organizations with differing opinions on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. This criticism has often included allegations of antisemitism.\n\nIn 2010, Mondoweiss was criticized by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs for publishing a series of cartoons which they stated expressed \"anti-Israelism, a more recent category of anti-Semitism\".\n\nBetween 2010 and 2011, \"Tablet\" magazine published three articles, in which Mondoweiss, along with some other blogs, were thoroughly criticized. These articles characterized Weiss as a \"Jew-baiter\" and \"intensely anti-Israel\", saying his site is \"obsessed with Israel and the machinations of the U.S. Israel lobby\", and laden with \"sweeping and unsubstantiated rhetoric\". \n\nWeiss responded to allegations in \"Tablet\", by stating that the magazine had \"smeared\" him and several other bloggers as Jew-baiters. Walt questioned the article's premise by stating that Smith's article contained \"not a scintilla of evidence\" that \"Weiss, or I have written or said anything that is remotely anti-Semitic, much less that involves 'Jew-baiting'. There's an obvious reason for this omission: None of us has ever written or said anything that supports Smith's outrageous charges.\"\n\nIn 2012, \"The Algemeiner Journal\" characterized Mondoweiss as \"Purveyors of Anti-Semitic Material\". Also, Armin Rosen, a Media Fellow with \"The Atlantic\", criticized Peter Beinart's blog, \"Open Zion\" (which appears in \"The Daily Beast\") for publishing an article by Alex Kane because he is Mondoweiss's \"Staff Reporter\". Rosen wrote that \"\"Mondoweiss\" often gives the appearance of an anti-Semitic enterprise.\"\n\nRobert Wright, a Senior Editor at \"The Atlantic\", responded to Rosen's article, writing \"This tarring of Kane by virtue of his association with Mondoweiss would be lamentable even if Rosen produced a convincing indictment of Mondoweiss, showing that it indeed evinces anti-Semitism.\" James Fallows, a national correspondent for \"The Atlantic\" concurred with Wright's response to Rosen. Alex Kane, Adam Horowitz, and Philip Weiss responded in \"Mondoweiss\" arguing that Rosen's article, \"is about nothing more than policing the discourse on Israel\".\n\nLater that year, \"The Algemeiner Journal\" published another article decrying Mondoweiss for its associations with Judith Butler, in light of her recent comments describing Islamist movements, even those of the militant variety, like Hamas and Hezbollah, as \"social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left\".\n\nIn 2013, Peter Beinart, writing for \"The Daily Beast\", accused Mondoweiss of \"ignoring human rights abuse unless it can be linked to America or capitalism or the West\", and said that \"By admitting that they're more interested in human rights violations when Israel commits them than when Hamas does, Horowitz and Roth are implying that they don't really see human rights as universal\". Later in the year \"Commentary\" magazine accused Mondoweiss of being complicit in an \"effort to delegitimize Jewish rights\".\n\nJournalist Bradley Burston, writing for \"Haaretz\", described Mondoweiss as \"avowedly anti-Israel\" in reference to its coverage of the 2014 kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers. \"Haaretz\" itself has described Mondoweiss as a \"progressive Jewish website\".\n\nIn 2015, David Bernstein, writing for \"The Washington Post\", called the website a \"hate site\", and listed quotes from Weiss that he asserted were anti-Semitic. This included Weiss' claim that \"the Israel lobby ... reflected a contract the American establishment had made with Jews to drive the economy in the 1970s\", which Bernstein likened to a belief in an \"Elders of Zion type group\".\n\nAccording to Elliot Kaufman, the Vice President of Cardinal for Israel, a Stanford University group, writing in \"The Stanford Review\", Mondoweiss \"often publishes astonishingly anti-Semitic material, using classic anti-Semitic imagery such as depicting Jews as spiders, cockroaches, or octopuses with tentacles controlling others, and Holocaust inversion. Its hatred of Israel is as deep as it is vicious.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "247406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247406", "title": "Nubians", "text": "Nubians\n\nNubians () are an ethnolinguistic group indigenous to present-day Sudan and southern Egypt who originate from the early inhabitants of the central Nile valley, believed to be one of the earliest cradles of civilization. They speak Nubian languages, part of the Northern Eastern Sudanic languages.\n\nEarly Neolithic settlements from prehistoric Egypt have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC, with Wadi Halfa believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley. Parts of Nubia, such as Ta-Seti (the first nome or administrative region of ancient Egypt), were continuously a part of ancient Egypt throughout the dynastic era. Other parts of Nubia, particularly Southern or Upper Nubia, were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of Meroë or the Kingdom of Kush. However, by the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, all of Nubia was united with Egypt, extending down to what is now Khartoum.\n\nTowards the end of the dynastic era, Upper Nubia broke off from Egypt proper. During that time, the Nubians founded a dynasty that ruled Upper and Lower Egypt in the eighth century BC. As warriors, the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the bow and arrow.\n\nIn the medieval period the Nubians converted to Christianity and established three kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, Makuria in the center and Alodia in the south. \n\nToday, people of Nubian descent primarily live in southern Egypt, especially in the Luxor and Aswan area, and in northern Sudan, particularly in the region between the city of Wadi Halfa on the Egyptian-Sudanese border and al Dabbah. Additionally, several groups known as the Hill Nubians live in the northern Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state, Sudan. The main Nubian groups from north to south are the Halfaweyen, Sikut, Mahas and Dongola.\n\nThroughout history various parts of Nubia were known by different names, including \"Land of the Bow\", \"tꜣ nḥsj\", \"jꜣm\" \"Kerma\", \"jrṯt\", \"sṯjw\", \"wꜣwꜣt\", Meroitic: \"akin(e)\" «Lower \"Nubia\"» and \"qes(a), qos(a)\" \"Kush\", and Greek \"Aethiopia\". The origin of the names \"Nubia\" and \"Nubian\" are contested. What is more certain is that they ultimately denote geographical provenance rather than ethnic origin. Based on cultural traits, many scholars believe Nubia is derived from the \"gold\". The Roman Empire used the term \"Nubia\" to describe the area of Upper Egypt and northern Sudan. Another etymology traces the toponym to a distinct group of people, the \"Noubai\", who in more recent times inhabited the area that would become known as Nubia. The derivation of the term \"Nubian\" has also been associated with the Greek historian Strabo, who referred to the Nubas people.\n\nThe prehistory of Nubia dates to the Paleolithic around 300,000 years ago. By about 6000 BC, peoples in the region had developed an agricultural economy. They began using a system of writing relatively late in their history, when they adopted the Egyptian hieroglyphic system. Ancient history in Nubia is categorized according to the following periods: A-Group culture (3700–2800 BC), C-Group culture (2300–1600), Kerma culture (2500–1500), Nubian contemporaries of the New Kingdom (1550–1069), the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (1000–653), Napata (1000–275), Meroë (275 BC–300/350 AD), Makuria (340–1317), Nobatia (350–650), and Alodia (600s–1504).\n\nHistoriolinguistic analysis indicates that the early inhabitants of the Nubia region, during the C-Group and Kerma cultures, were speakers of languages belonging to the Berber and Cushitic branches of the Afroasiatic family. They were succeeded by the first Nubian language speakers, whose tongues belonged to the separate Nilo-Saharan phylum. Accordingly, a 4th-century victory stela belonging to King Ezana of the Kingdom of Aksum contains inscriptions describing two distinct population groups dwelling in ancient Nubia: a \"red\" \"Kasu\" population, who are believed to have been Cushitic speakers related to the neighbouring ancient Egyptians, and a \"black\" Eastern Sudanic-speaking population that was instead related to Nilotes. The existence of two such distinct population groups in Nubia has also been confirmed through genetic analysis (see genetics).\n\nAlthough Egypt and Nubia have a shared pre-dynastic and pharaonic history, the two histories diverge with the fall of Ancient Egypt and the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. At this point, the area of land between the 1st and the 6th cataract of the Nile became known as Nubia. Egypt was conquered first by the Greeks and then the Romans. During this time period, however, the Kushites formed the kingdom of Meroë, which was ruled by a series of legendary Candaces or Queens. Mythically, the Candace of Meroë was able to intimidate Alexander the Great into retreat with a great army of elephants, while historical documents suggest that the Nubians defeated the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar, resulting in a favorable peace treaty for Meroë. The kingdom of Meroë also defeated the Persians, and later Christian Nubia defeated the invading Arab armies on three different occasions resulting in the 600 year peace treaty of Baqt, the longest lasting treaty in history. The fall of the kingdom of Christian Nubia occurred in the early 1500s resulting in full Islamization and reunification with Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, the Muhammad Ali dynasty, and British colonial rule. After the 1956 independence of Sudan from Egypt, Nubia and the Nubian people became divided between Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan.\nModern Nubians speak Nubian languages, Eastern Sudanic languages that is part of the Nilo-Saharan family. The Old Nubian language is attested from the 8th century, and is the oldest recorded language of Africa outside of the Afroasiatic family. It was the language of the Noba nomads who occupied the Nile between the First and Third Cataracts and also of the \"Makorae\" nomads who occupied the land between the Third and Fourth Cataracts, following the collapse of the Kingdom of Kush sometime in the fourth century. The \"Makorae\" were a separate tribe who eventually conquered or inherited the lands of the Noba: they established a Byzantine-influenced state called the Makuria, which administered the Noba lands separately as the eparchy of Nobatia. Nobadia was converted to Miaphysitism by the Orthodox priest Julian and Bishop Longinus of Constantinople, and thereafter received its bishops from the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.\n\nNubia consisted of four regions with varied agriculture and landscapes. The Nile river and its valley were found in the north and central parts of Nubia, allowing farming using irrigation. The western Sudan had a mixture of peasant agriculture and nomadism. Eastern Sudan had primarily nomadism, with a few areas of irrigation and agriculture. Finally, there was the fertile pastoral region of the south, where Nubia's larger agricultural communities were located.\n\nNubia was dominated by kings from clans that controlled the gold mines. Trade in exotic goods from other parts of Africa (ivory, animal skins) passed to Egypt through Nubia.\n\nModern Nubians speak Nubian languages. It belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan phylum.\n\nBefore the arrival of the first Nubian speakers, languages from the Afroasiatic family are believed to have been spoken by the early inhabitants of the Nubia region. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence indicates that the ancient peoples of the C-Group and Kerma civilizations spoke Afroasiatic languages of the Berber and Cushitic branches, respectively. The Nilo-Saharan Nobiin language today contains a number of key pastoralism related loanwords that are of Berber or proto-Highland East Cushitic origin, including the terms for sheep/goatskin, hen/cock, livestock enclosure, butter and milk. This in turn suggests that the C-Group and Kerma populations, who inhabited the Nile Valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers, spoke Afroasiatic languages.\n\nHowever, it is uncertain to which language family the ancient Meroitic language is related. Claude Rilly has proposed that it, like the Nobiin language, belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, instead belongs to the Afroasiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which are similar to those of the Afroasiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.\n\nThe descendants of the ancient Nubians still inhabit the general area of what was ancient Nubia. They currently live in what is called Old Nubia, mainly located in modern Egypt. Nubians have been resettled in large numbers (an estimated 50,000 people) away from southern Egypt since the 1960s, when the Aswan High Dam was built on the Nile, flooding ancestral lands. Some resettled Nubians continue working as farmers (sharecroppers) on resettlement farms whose landowners live elsewhere; most work in Egypt's cities. Whereas Arabic was once only learned by Nubian men who travelled for work, it is increasingly being learned by Nubian women who have access to school, radio and television. Nubian women are working outside the home in increasing numbers.\n\nIn the 1973 Arab–Israeli War Egypt employed Nubian people as codetalkers.\n\nNubians have developed a common identity, which has been celebrated in poetry, novels, music and storytelling.\n\nNubians in modern Sudan include the Danaqla around Dongola Reach, the Mahas from the Third Cataract to Wadi Halfa, and the Sikurta around Aswan. These Nubians write using their own script. They also practice scarification: Mahas men and women have three scars on each cheek, while the Danaqla wear these scars on their temples. Younger generations appear to be abandoning this custom.\n\nNubia's ancient cultural development was influenced by its geography. It is sometimes divided into Upper Nubia and Lower Nubia. Upper Nubia was where the ancient Kingdom of Napata (the Kush) was located. Lower Nubia has been called \"the corridor to Africa\", where there was contact and cultural exchange between Nubians, Egyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, and Arabs. Lower Nubia was also where the Kingdom of Meroe flourished. The languages spoken by modern Nubians are based on ancient Sudanic dialects. From north to south, they are: Kenuz, Fadicha (Matoki), Sukkot, Mahas, Danagla.\n\nKerma, Nepata and Meroe were Nubia's largest population centres. The rich agricultural lands of Nubia supported these cities. Ancient Egyptian rulers sought control of Nubia's wealth, including gold, and the important trade routes within its territories. Nubia's trade links with Egypt led to Egypt's domination over Nubia during the New Kingdom period. The emergence of the Kingdom of Meroe in the 8th century BC led to Egypt being under the control of Nubian rulers for a century, although they preserved many Egyptian cultural traditions. Nubian kings were considered pious scholars and patrons of the arts, copying ancient Egyptian texts and even restoring some Egyptian cultural practices. After this, Egypt's influence declined greatly. Meroe became the centre of power for Nubia and cultural links with sub-Saharan Africa gained greater influence.\n\nToday, Nubians practice Islam. To a certain degree, Nubian religious practices involve a syncretism of Islam and traditional folk beliefs. In ancient times, Nubians practiced a mixture of traditional religion and Egyptian religion. Prior to the spread of Islam, many Nubians practiced Christianity.\n\nAncient Nepata was an important religious centre in Nubia. It was the location of Gebel Barkal, a massive sandstone hill resembling a rearing cobra in the eyes of the ancient inhabitants. Egyptian priests declared it to be the home of the ancient deity Amun, further enhancing Nepata as an ancient religious site. This was the case for both Egyptians and Nubians. Egyptian and Nubian deities alike were worshipped in Nubia for 2,500 years, even while Nubia was under the control of the New Kingdom of Egypt. Nubian kings and queens were buried near Gebel Barkal, in pyramids as the Egyptian pharaohs were. Nubian pyramids were built at Gebel Barkal, at Nuri (across the Nile from Gebel Barkal), at El Kerru, and at Merroe, south of Gebel Barkal.\n\nModern Nubian architecture in Sudan is distinctive, and typically features a large courtyard surrounded by a high wall. A large, ornately decorated gate, preferably facing the Nile, dominates the property. Brightly colored stucco is often decorated with symbols connected with the family inside, or popular motifs such as geometric patterns, palm trees, or the evil eye that wards away bad luck.\n\nNubians invented the Nubian vault, a type of curved surface forming a vaulted structure.\n\nAccording to Y-DNA analysis by Hassan et al. (2008), around 44% of Nubians in Sudan carry the haplogroup J. The remainder mainly belong to the E1b1b clade (23%). Both paternal lineages are also common among local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. The next most frequent haplogroups borne by Nubians are the Western European-linked R1b clade (10%) and the Eurasian lineage F (10%), followed by the archaic African B haplogroup (8%) and the Europe-associated I clade (5%).\n\nMaternally, Hassan (2009) observed that approximately 83% of their Nubian samples carried various subclades of the Africa-centered macrohaplogroup L. Of these mtDNA lineages, the most frequently borne clade was L3 (30.8%), followed by the L0a (20.6%), L2 (10.3%), L1 (6.9%), L4 (6.9%) and L5 (6.9%) haplogroups. The remaining 17% of Nubians belonged to sublineages of the Eurasian macrohaplogroups M (3.4% M/D, 3.4% M1) and N (3.4% N1a, 3.4% preHV1, 3.4% R/U6a1). Analysing a different group of Nubian individuals inhabiting Sudan, Non (2010) found a significantly higher frequency of around 48% of the Eurasian macrohaplogroups M and N. Of these mtDNA lineages, 16% of the examined Nubians belonged to the M clade (around 9% to M1), with the rest bearing N subhaplogroups (including approximately 8% R0, 3% T1a, and 1% H). The remaining 52% of Nubians carried various Africa-centered macrohaplogroup L(xM,N) derivatives, with about 11% of individuals belonging to the L2a1 subclade.\n\nDobon et al. (2015) identified an ancestral autosomal component of West Eurasian origin that is common to many modern Nubians and Afroasiatic-speaking populations in the Nile Valley and Horn of Africa, including Sudanese Arabs. Known as the \"Coptic\" component, it peaks among Egyptian Copts who settled in Sudan over the past two centuries. The scientists associate the Coptic component with Ancient Egyptian ancestry, without the later Arabian influence that is present among other Egyptians. Hollfelder et al. (2017) also analysed various populations in Sudan and similarly observed close autosomal affinities between their Nubian and Sudanese Arab samples.\n\nIn 2015, Sirak et al. also analysed the ancient DNA of a Christian-period inhabitant of Kulubnarti in Nubia. The scientists found that the medieval specimen was most closely related to Middle Eastern populations. Further excavations of two Early Christian period (AD 550-800) cemeteries at Kulubnarti, one located on the mainland and the other on an island, revealed the existence of two ancestrally and socioeconomically distinct local populations. Ancient DNA analysis of specimens from these burial sites found that the mainland samples predominantly carried European and Near Eastern mtDNA clades, such as the K1, H, I5, and U1 lineages; only 36.4% of the mainland individuals belonged to African-based maternal haplogroups. By contrast, 70% of the specimens at the island burial site bore African-based clades, among which were the L2, L1 and L5 mtDNA haplogroups.\n\nThe Nubians are sometimes confused with the Nubi people also sometimes referred to as Nubians, estimated at 100,000–200,000, who live in Kenya and Uganda. The Nubi are descendants of soldiers conscripted by the British during the colonial era, and they are originally from modern day South Sudan and the Darfur region.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They have a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and property passed through the maternal lines. \n\nA religious Kundum Festival is held annually all over the Ahanta-Nzema area. Its start is timed to coordinate with the harvest period, so local communities determine when that will be. It begins in the easternmost part of Ahanta and advances southwestward together with the harvest period. Ritual drumming, singing and dancing take place for four weeks, and are considered the way the community expels devils and protects its good fortune. This festival is the main occasion on which the satirical \"avudewene\" songs are performed by young men. \nThe pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah was an Nzema.

The organization is notable for the diverse background of its members that includes civilians and veterans of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Members have served in the United States military, the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force, Germany's Luftwaffe, and the Soviet Air Forces.\n\nThe Old Bold Pilots Association (OBPA) traces its beginnings to the mid-1980s when four former United States Army Air Force P-47 Thunderbolt pilots met regularly for a meal and to share flying stories. The society formed with its current name and meeting location in 1995 at the suggestion of member Ray Toliver. The name of the group is a refutation of an observation made in 1949 by early airmail pilot, E. Hamilton Lee: \"There are old pilots and bold pilots, but no old, bold pilots.\" The association is informal without a charter, dues, or speakers. Informality was desired by members who rejected the strict rules common in other aviation groups. One does not have to be a pilot to attend, and anyone with an interest in aviation is invited.\n\nThe OBPA holds a breakfast event every Wednesday at a Denny's restaurant in Oceanside, California. The breakfast starts at 8 am although members start showing up as early as 6:30 am to get a head start on the festivities. The group occupies the back room of the restaurant which is decorated with model aircraft hanging from the ceiling and photos of aircraft and pilots lining the walls. Attendees come from communities throughout southern California. Less frequent are visitors from around the world including Germany, Australia, Hungary and South Africa. Some come for the camaraderie while others find relief discussing the rigors of combat with people who have had similar experiences.\n\n, membership has grown to over 300 people, although attendance at the weekly breakfast is typically 50–70 people. According to the group's web page, an annual Christmas party and periodic barbecues are also hosted.\n\nHeather Steele is a historian of warfare who over the course of several years interviewed a number of the OBPA members and captured their stories on her World War II History Project web site. Jonelle Cambis is a waitress who has served the OBPA at Dennys for over 20 years. Her father was in the Pacific with the U.S. Marines during World War II, and she credits the stories told by her customers with motivating her to document her father's activities.\n\nIn 2014, retired producer, Patrick Pranica, with friends George Dawe and Robert Broughton began interviewing OBPA members to record their stories for future generations. They started first with older OBPA members due to their advanced age but planned to include all willing to participate. The initial interviews were intended to result in a documentary titled, \"Old Bold Pilots\", that was hoped would interest cable channels into funding a television series. The pilot episode included an interview with Robert Broughton's brother, Jack Broughton, a famous fighter ace and aviation author. However, funding could not be secured. The team also tried a crowdfunded campaign that did not succeed and was eventually closed.\n\nChapters of the Old Bold Pilots have opened in Palm Desert, California, Seattle, Washington, and Washington, D.C. The Palm Desert group meets for breakfast at the Desert Willow Golf Resort on the last Thursday of each month and includes a presentation by a guest speaker. Past speakers have included aerial stuntman Troy Hartman, former Northrop Grumman Chief Executive Officer Kent Kresa, fighter ace Fritz Payne, aerospace engineer Burt Rutan, and aviation artist Stan Stokes. The Washington, D.C. group meets for lunch every Friday at the Army Navy Country Club in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThe following table contains an of individuals who are or were members of the Old Bold Pilots Association.

Its objective is to help organizations achieve their cost and operational targets. It does this by identifying the relevant parameters that managers can control, linking them to the business objectives, showing which changes will be effective, and creating an execution roadmap that will achieve the objectives.\n\nFor any business improvement challenge, ProFIT-MAP answers four important management questions. Managers then use this information as an input into their decision making process.\n\n\nThe process of using the ProFIT-MAP methodology is referred to as profit mapping. ProFIT-MAP assesses the current and future operational requirements of any business challenge from three integrated perspectives representing the business process, its associated resource requirements, and the financial characteristics. Understanding the cost and profitability implications of any process improvement decision prior to its implementation is central to profit mapping.\n\nThe methodology consists of six phases which must be completed in order. There is built-in flexibility to iterate within and between the phases as managers refine their thinking and gain additional experience with the particular business challenge.\n\nProfit mapping is used by companies to execute their strategy no matter what it is. Strategy can range from everything to improving profitability, increasing customer satisfaction, reducing costs, becoming more flexible in product or service delivery, reducing waste, and so on.\n\nAs companies translate strategy into measurable objectives, profit mapping then bridges the gap between planning and execution. It does this by identifying:\n\n\nProfit mapping complements the many strategic frameworks, improvement approaches, and measurement options in business today. It does not replace what companies already find helpful. Rather, its integrated and dynamic nature enhances existing business improvement efforts by providing additional critical “perspective” and guidance that might not otherwise be available to decision makers.\n\nFor example, there is an implicit assumption that becoming lean or reducing product defects through Six Sigma leads to cost savings. Many companies have learned through experience that while these are sound improvement strategies, they do not always have the intended impact on overall business performance relative to the financial and time investment devoted to the efforts.\n\nSuch results should not be surprising as lean and Six Sigma are designed to improve process efficiency, but do not explicitly focus on the overall effectiveness of the organization. Profit mapping can help these types of process-focused initiatives by showing precisely which lean or Six Sigma activities will lead to both process as well as financial improvement. This helps managers understand the cost and profitability implications of their change options so they can make more effective decisions.\n\nActivities are at the core of ProFIT-MAP. The methodology employs a parametric activities based framework for capturing the business structure and dynamic characteristics of operations. ProFIT-MAP:\n\n\nProFIT-MAP is a non-proprietary methodology and is described in the book profit mapping. As managers develop ideas in the form of business scenarios for improving the organization, analytical capabilities are required that can quantify the impact of the various business improvement options. The objective is to help managers select the “best” option(s) from the standpoint of the overall business – not just those that may result in isolated improvements but not necessarily for the organization.\n\nProFIT-MAP requires the integrated assessment of each decision option in terms of the process characteristics, resource requirements, and financial effects. There are many software tools that address aspects of each of these areas individually. Most importantly, any software tool must enable apple-to-apple comparisons within each of these domains as well as between them. Otherwise, managers will not have a level playing field to holistically evaluate and compare their alternatives for improving the business.\n\nProFIT-MAP was created by Anil Menawat. Its foundation is based on systems theory, which is an integrated approach for studying complex, dynamic, and interdependent systems. It also had roots in parametric costing which dates back to World War II where government planners needed a better way to forecast the cost of manufacturing aircraft.\n\nThe name ProFIT-MAP is derived from two elements. “ProFIT” comes from “process and finance integration technology.” This refers to the methodology’s integrated multi-perspective focus on business execution. “MAP” refers to the methodology’s ability to create a highly detailed roadmap for improving the business.\n\nMenawat & Co. has a trademark for ProFIT-MAP for consulting services and a brand of software.\n\nManufacturing and business services\n\nActivity-based costing\nBalanced scorecard\nBenchmarking\nBusiness planning\nBusiness process improvement\nCapital investment planning\nContinuous improvement\nCorporate or divisional strategy\nDesign for manufacturability\nEconomic value added\nFinancial modeling\nFlexible manufacturing\nHuman resources management\nLean manufacturing\nLean operations\nManagement accounting\nMergers and acquisitions\nProcess design / redesign\nPerformance management\nProduct design\nProduct planning\nResearch and development\nRisk analysis\nSix Sigma\nSourcing decisions (e.g., insourcing, outsourcing, offshoring)\nStrategic management\nSupply chain management\nTheory of Constraints\nToyota Production System\nValue Stream Mapping\n\n"}

She had been arrested for the similar charge in August of the same year. She told the police that her five-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted at the kindergarten and received a psychological therapy with her daughter but the trauma caused her kleptomania and submitted a medical record from the psychiatrist. The police, given that she was raising three children and had a history of psychiatric treatment, investigated her without arrest and sent her file to the Prosecutors Office in Eastern District of Seoul for indictment. She has been represented by an attorney-at-law, Chulseong Jung.\n\nThe prosecutor was a married, 30-year-old man and graduated in the top at a private law school Seoul.

{"id": "17179390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17179390", "title": "Prostitution in Indonesia", "text": "Prostitution in Indonesia\n\nProstitution in Indonesia is legally considered a \"crime against decency/morality\", although it is widely practiced, tolerated and even regulated in some areas. Some women are financially motivated to become prostitutes, while others may be forced by friends, relatives or strangers. Traditionally, they have met with customers in entertainment venues or special prostitution complexes, or \"lokalisasi\". However, recently internet forums and Facebook have been used to facilitate prostitute-client relations. In recent years, child sex tourism has become an issue at the resort islands of Batam and Bali. \nFemale sex tourism also emerged in the late 20th century in Bali. Young Balinese male sex workers meet with Japanese, European, and Australian women who, by all accounts, seem perfectly happy with the arrangement. UNAIDS estimate there to be 226,791 prostitutes in the country.\n\nIn Indonesia, one of the main reasons for a prostitute to enter the business is the attractiveness of earning money quickly. \"The Jakarta Post\" reported that high-end prostitutes in Jakarta could earn Rp 15 million - Rp 30 million (USD 1,755 to 3,510) monthly, able to charge more than Rp 3 million (USD 350) per session for their services. Those entering prostitution for money come from both middle-class and poor families.\n\nAnother major cause is forced prostitution. Young women are offered employment opportunities in major cities, then raped and forced to prostitute themselves while paying money to their pimps. They may also be sold by their parents. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reports that roughly 70 percent of Indonesian child prostitutes are brought into the trade by their family or friends.\n\nProstitution exists in many forms and is practiced by many different sexes, genders, orientations and ages. Bali, for example, is known for its \"Kuta Cowboys\", male sex workers who solicit foreign tourists.\n\nProstitution encompasses various sexual orientations. The most common is heterosexual female prostitution, though transvestite and male homosexual prostitution also exist to a lesser extent. Child prostitution also exists in certain tourism resort islands, such as Batam and Bali. It is estimated that 40,000 to 70,000 Indonesian children engage in prostitution within the country.\n\nProstitutes sometimes work in brothels, some with over 200 prostitutes. The last large red-light district containing many brothels was Gang Dolly in Surabaya, one of the largest in Southeast Asia, which closed in 2014. Prostitutes can be found in discotheques, massage parlours, and karaoke rooms, and also visible on certain streets. They can also be booked via telephone.\n\nOnline prostitution is also common. In internet forums, prostitutes and pornography are offered to registered members of good standing, as measured by their activity on the forum. A senior member of the forum posts a \"free report\" offering a description of the member's experience with a prostitute; contact information is provided upon request by private message. Prostitution rings on Facebook have also been reported.\n\nProstitution is not specifically addressed in the law. However, many officials interpreted \"crimes against decency/morality\" to apply to prostitution. Prostitution is widespread and largely tolerated, despite its contradiction with popular societal and religious norms Prostitution is most visibly manifested in Indonesia’s brothel complexes, or \"lokalisasi\", which are found throughout the country. These brothels are managed under local government regulations. During or after raids by the police, the prostitutes are able to pay and be released from custody; this has led to police raids being called \"nothing more than an income source for public order officers\".\n\nThe Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) estimates that 30 percent of the prostitutes in Indonesia are below 18 years of age. The ILO puts the total number of child prostitutes in Jakarta at 5,000; according to the Jakarta city government, this is concentrated in Prumpung (North Jakarta), Grogol (West Jakarta) Tanah Abang (Central Jakarta), Block M (South Jakarta), as well as Jatinegara and Ciracas (both East Jakarta). Child sex tourism occurs, especially on the resort islands of Bali and Batam.\n\nOne of the earliest reports of prostitution in ancient Indonesia is from a Chinese source. The Tang dynasty Ch'iu-T'ang shu and Hsin T'ang shu historical records, which originated circa 640 CE, reported that in the country of Ho-ling in Java, there were a number of \"poisonous women\". Those who had sex with these harlots would suffer festering wounds and die afterwards. This was the earliest record of prostitution and its connection with sexually-transmitted disease in ancient Java.\n\nLittle is known about precolonial Indonesia's prostitution, although the purchase of sex slaves and \"quasi-contractual\" sexual relations are thought to have occurred. Following the spread of Islam in Indonesia, prostitution is thought to have increased due to Islam's disapproval of contractual weddings. Javanese kings kept large stables of concubines, while Balinese widows without familial support could be prostituted by their king.\n\nSerat Centhini, an early 19th century Javanese manuscript, refers to the prostitution business in Central Java and Yogyakarta. The manuscript describes various sexual positions and techniques mastered by prostitutes in Java in order to satisfy their clients. Serat Centhini also says that there was once a thriving brothel near the royal tomb of Imogiri.\n\nDuring the early Dutch colonial period, European men wishing to find sexual gratification began hiring native prostitutes or concubines; this was accepted by financially motivated local women as well as some families, who volunteered their daughters. Because interracial marriage was discouraged or outright forbidden, this arrangement was accepted by Dutch leaders.\n\nWidespread prostitution began in the early 1800s, when the number of concubines kept by the Royal Netherlands East Indies soldiers and government officials declined; native men leaving their wives to look for work in other areas also contributed to its rise. In 1852 the colonial government began requiring regular health checks of prostitutes to check for syphilis and other venereal diseases; prostitutes also had to carry identification cards. These did not curb the growth of prostitution, which increased dramatically during a period of extensive construction in the late 1800s.\n\nThe 1852 law was later replaced by another, more stringent, public morality law in 1913, which criminalized \"purposely bring[ing] about the fornication of others with a third party and make this his profession\", or pimping; no mention was made of prostitutes. Enforcement of these laws proved more nearly impossible, and for a period of time investigation of brothels required a permit from the governor.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, existing prostitutes were selected to serve the Japanese army in special brothels. Other women and girls, both native and Dutch, were forced to become \"comfort women\". After World War II, the migration of women from remote villages to cities, coupled with a high divorce rate, caused another increase in prostitution.\n\nGovernment response to prostitution in Indonesia has been varied. A common response is to attempt banning it and closing brothels. Another proposed response is the taxing of prostitutes' fees; such proposals have met controversy, with the revenues being considered \"haraam\".\n\nProstitution has been blamed for the increasing HIV/AIDS rates in various parts of Indonesia, including Central Java and Bali. A lack of health control in brothels and a lack of condom use have been blamed; in 2010 the Bali AIDS commission reported that only 40% of clients used protection.\n\nProstitutes themselves may fall victim to psycho-social problems, such as multiple personality disorder. When servicing customers or dealing with their pimps, they may be physically and mentally abused. They are also at risk of catching HIV/AIDS.\n\nIndonesia is a major source, and to a much lesser extent, destination and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Each of its 34 provinces is a source and destination of trafficking. Indonesian women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking, primarily in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Middle East. Many women and girls are exploited in sex trafficking. Victims are often recruited with offers of jobs in restaurants, factories, or domestic service, but are subjected to sex trafficking. Debt bondage is particularly prevalent among sex trafficking victims. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking near mining operations in Maluku, Papua, and Jami provinces. Child sex tourism is prevalent in the Riau Islands bordering Singapore, and Bali is a destination for Indonesians traveling to engage in child sex tourism.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Indonesia as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\n\n"}

Wilson will produce and star in a feature film adaptation of the Image Comics comic book \"Crowded\". She will also star in the musical film \"Cats\" as Jennyanydots.\n\nIn May 2015, Australian magazine \"Woman's Day\" published a story claiming that Wilson had been misleading about her birth name, age, and upbringing. Wilson had previously said in interviews that she was raised by dog-training \"bogan\" parents in the ghetto of Sydney, spent a year in Zimbabwe, climbed into a cage with a leopard, got caught in a shoot-out and then struck down by a severe strain of malaria from a mosquito in Mozambique where, from her intensive care bed, she envisioned herself winning an Oscar and rapping her acceptance speech. Her age was also incorrectly given as 29, which she would later admit was something she chose not to correct. \"Woman's Day\" called all of this into question and claimed that Wilson had, on the contrary, a \"very normal, upper-middle-class upbringing\" and \"added a touch of 'fantasy' to the life she led before becoming a household name.\" The story was picked up by several other publications including \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", \"People\" magazine, the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"The Huffington Post\". Most notably, Wilson's true birth date was confirmed through business records filed with the ASIC, which were obtained by \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\nOn 16 May 2016, Wilson said print and online articles in \"Woman's Day\", the Australian \"Women's Weekly\", \"NW\" and \"OK!\" magazines made her out to be a serial liar. According to a defamation writ filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Wilson said her reputation and credit had suffered and she had been humiliated and embarrassed. She also sued for special damages, claiming she missed out on roles and other ones were terminated because of the articles. Wilson was represented by Matthew Collins QC. On 15 June 2017, a six-person jury ruled in Wilson's favour, finding that publisher Bauer Media Group had indeed wrongly painted the actress as a serial liar, and that publishing the articles was likely to have caused harm to her career.\n\nOn 13 September 2017, Wilson was awarded in damages. Wilson's lawyer Richard Leder, said \"Today's verdict is a significant record—it's about four times the highest previous verdict in a defamation case in Australia\". In June 2017, Wilson tweeted \"Any dollars I receive will go to charity, scholarships or invested into the Aussie film industry to provide jobs\".\n\nBauer Media appealed the amount of the damages. On 14 June 2018, Bauer Media won its appeal and the damages were reduced to $600,000. Wilson announced her intention to appeal the decision, and lodged an appeal with the High Court on 11 July 2018. The High Court refused the application on 16 November 2018.\n\nIn July 2011, Wilson became a spokesperson for weight loss and nutrition company Jenny Craig in Australia. In January 2012, Wilson told \"The Daily Telegraph\" that she had lost since signing up to the program.\n\nWilson asserted that the producers of \"Pitch Perfect\" had refused to let her lose any more weight during filming, as her contract stated she must stay the same size. She said that once her film commitments were over, she would start her diet again to reach her target weight of . In February 2013, she confirmed that she had ended her agreement with Jenny Craig the previous year.\n\nWilson and her \"Bridesmaids\" co-star Matt Lucas lived together in West Hollywood, from September 2012 until 2015.\n\nIn July 2015, Wilson stated her support for stricter American gun laws following the 2015 Lafayette shooting, stating, \"I don't like getting political but America you really have to follow Australia's example re gun laws. I don't remember a mass shooting in Australia since they overhauled the gun laws. It seems like every week in America there's a shooting. I just want people to be safe, especially people that are doing one of my favorite things in the world—going out to the movies to have fun.\"\n\n"}

More generally it is any process, unauthorised by an existing legal order, which results in the creation of a new legal order; whether or not the revolutionary change is brought about by violence. A technical breach of continuity might happen when the former constitutional arrangement is so inefficient that there isn't even a practical legal way to amend it.\n\nThe most recent successful \"revolutionary breach\" in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, was the Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689 which replaced King James II of England and Ireland (King James VII of Scotland) with the joint sovereignty of his son-in-law King William III of England (King William II of Scotland) and daughter Queen Mary II of England (and Scotland).\n\nThe United States Declaration of Independence is another example, as it had no basis in the previous legal order which had governed the thirteen colonies and represented the start of a new legal order. A few years later the replacement of the Articles of Confederation with the United States Constitution was a technical breach of continuity, which didn't result in a civil war only because of the very reason of the breach: the first USA defined by the Articles had a weak central government that therefore had no means to defend itself.\n\nThere was an attempted \"revolutionary breach\" in the whole of Ireland in 1919, when the First Dáil, a gathering of persons elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons in 1918, declared an Irish Republic, without any authority to do so within the terms of the United Kingdom's legal order. The subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty and steps taken under it gave the Irish Free State legitimacy within the United Kingdom legal order, but they delegitimised it for those who regarded the applicable legal order to be that proclaimed in 1919.\n\nWhen the present constitution of Ireland was adopted the amending formula of the Irish Free State constitution was deliberately not used, despite having the necessary support, so the new constitution would represent a \"revolutionary breach\" and derive its legitimacy from purely Irish sources.\n\nSimilar steps were taken so the Indian people became the source of legitimacy for the republican constitution of India. The republican constitution replaced the one authorised by the United Kingdom at the time of independence, but did not comply with its provisions for amendments.\n\nThe term has also been applied to regime change following a military coup in Commonwealth of Nations members such as Pakistan and Nigeria.\n\n"}

{"id": "55198009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55198009", "title": "Sarah Burger Stearns", "text": "Sarah Burger Stearns\n\nSarah Burger Stearns (November 30, 1836 – October 26, 1904) was a social reformer and a leader in the woman's suffrage movement in the U.S. state of Minnesota. She co-founded the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association and served as its first president.\n\nSarah Burger was born in New York City on November 30, 1836. In 1845, her family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, and later, to Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBurger showed an early interest in woman's suffrage when she attended a national suffrage convention in Cleveland at age 14 where she heard talks by Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone, and other national leaders. In 1858, she organized twelve young women to make the first formal application, by women, for admission to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The reply they received was \"It seems inexpedient, at present, for the University to admit ladies\". Discussion continued until 1869 when women (but not Stearns) were admitted.\n\nStearns accepted a position as a Greek and Latin teacher in an academy. After a year, she applied to University of Michigan again and was, again, refused. She entered and graduated from the State Normal School in Ypsilanti, Michigan.\n\nIn 1863, she married Lieutenant Ozora P. Stearns whom she had met 5 years earlier. After marriage, while he was in the army, Sarah was preceptress in a seminary for young women in Monroe, Michigan. She also lectured for the benefit of the Soldiers' Aid Societies and the Sanitary Commission. She was invited to give a lecture to the Theodore Parker Fraternity (a social and religious society) in Boston; her lecture was titled, \"Wrongs of Women and Their Redress \". She also taught Freedmen where her husband (now Colonel Stearns) was stationed.\n\nIn 1866, the Stearns's moved from Michigan to Rochester, Minnesota, and Sarah continued to give lectures on subjects such as \"Woman and Home\" and \"Woman and the Republic\", and wrote newspaper articles on education.\n\nStearns and Mary Colburn (and \"friends of equality\") petitioned the legislature for an amendment to strike the word \"male\" from the section of the Minnesota State Constitution which enfranchised \"every male person\", as a means to provide women with the right to vote. Stearns and Colburn were given a hearing before a legislative committee in 1867 but, ultimately, the bill failed in committee (by a majority of one) and no action was taken.\n\nIn 1869, Susan B. Anthony traveled through the Midwest encouraging women to form local affiliates of the National Woman Suffrage Association. After her visit, Stearns and Colburn formed the first suffrage societies in Minnesota: Stearns in Rochester with 50 members and Colburn in Champlin.\n\nThe Stearns's moved to Duluth, Minnesota, in 1872. Sarah organized another suffrage society, the Duluth Woman Suffrage Circle, and served as its president from 1881–1893. She supported temperance, served as a member of the Duluth school board for three years, and was the Minnesota vice-president for the Association for the Advancement of Women for several years. Stearns was characterized in a local newspaper as \"a power in the young community [Duluth] as well as in the state of Minnesota\".\n\nIn 1875, the Minnesota constitution was amended to allow women of 21 years or older to vote in \"any election held for the purpose of choosing any officers of schools, or upon any measure relating to schools, and may also provide that any such woman shall be eligible to hold any office pertaining solely to the management of school\". Stearns, and other supporters, made no effort to campaign for votes in favor of the amendment because they were afraid that those efforts would simply rouse the opposition. Shortly before the election, Stearns contacted the editor of the St. Paul Pioneer Press to request support in his paper; the editor admitted that he had forgotten all about the amendment. Stearns and her colleagues persuaded both political parties to phrase the ballot, \"For the amendment of Article VII relating to electors–Yes\". In order to vote against the amendment, voters had to cross out 'Yes' and write in 'No'. The amendment passed 24,340 to 19,468. As Stearns later stated, \"our bitterest opponents forgot the question was to be voted upon, and the ignorant classes who could not, or did not read their ballots, voted unthinkingly for the measure\". After passage of the amendment, Stearns spoke at women's meetings, informing them of their new rights and campaigning for two female candidates from Minneapolis.\n\nStearns was the vice-president from Minnesota for the National Woman Suffrage Association for several years, and hosted Susan B. Anthony when Anthony visited Duluth.\n\nWhen an amendment to allow women to vote on matters relating to prohibition was voted down in 1877, Stearns and other woman leaders became convinced that a statewide organization was needed to move women's issues forward. Fourteen women met in Hastings, Minnesota, in 1881, and formed the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association (MWSA). Stearns became the first president. The association grew to 124 in its first year and doubled in number in the second year.\n\nIn 1882, Stearns was unanimously re-elected as president of the MWSA at its first annual meeting. In 1883, she stepped down due to ill health but accepted presidency of the Equal Rights League in Duluth.\n\nStearns played a vital role in the organization of a home for destitute women and children in 1885, which eventually developed into the Duluth Children's Home, and served as president of the society that maintained the home. After 5–6 years, a new home was built on property donated by two judges (Stearn's husband and Judge Ensign). The funds to build the home were donated by members of the society.\n\nIn 1894, the Stearns' moved to California, for Ozora's health. Sarah was chair of the Los Angeles Suffrage League in 1900, and she continued to work for women's rights until her death on January 26, 1904. In her obituary, Stearns is called \"one of the most prominent platform orators in the cause of woman suffrage and temperance\".\n\nIn 1996, a memorial garden was built on the grounds of the Minnesota State Capitol, to observe the 75th anniversary of the suffrage movement. The garden exhibit is called \"Garden of Time: Landscape of Change\", and is planted with native flowers and grasses. A monument in the garden lists the names of 25 women active in the movement, including Stearns.\n\n\n"}

It was the king's third council and primarily directed, as was the Sixteenth, against the Jews, of whom Egica seems to have had a profound distrust and dislike.\n\nThe king opened the synod by claiming that he had heard news of Jews overthrowing their Christian rulers overseas and that Iberian Jews were conspiring with these cousins to end the Christian religion once and for all. The council therefore decreed in its eight canon that all Jews, except those in Narbonensis, were to be deprived of their property, which was to be given to their Christian slaves, and enslaved themselves. Their slavekeepers were chosen by the king and were to be contractually obligated to never allow the practice of the Jewish religion again. It is, however, almost certain that, in at least some parts of Spain, these regulations were not strictly enforced; though in others, they certainly were.\n\nThe council tried to protect the life of Egica's queen and children after his death, knowing the harm which could befall the royal family during a succession, and the bishops ordered prayers said for their souls.\n\nThe council's minutes remain the best source of information for its period in Spanish history.\n\n(1) At the beginning of a Synod all the sacerdotes (bishops) shall fast for three days in honour of the Holy Trinity, and in this time, without the presence of the laity, hold converse on the doctrines of the faith and on the improvement of the morals of the clergy. After that they shall proceed to other subjects.\n\n(2) At the beginning of Lent, since from that time there are no more baptisms, except in case of extreme necessity, the font shall be sealed by the bishop with his ring, and so remain until the stripping of the altar at the feast of the \"Coena Domini\".\n\n(3) The washing of feet at the feast of the \"Coena Domini\", which has fallen into disuse in some places, must be observed everywhere.\n\n(4) The holy vessels and other ornaments of the Church may not be expended by the clergy for themselves, nor sold, etc.\n\n(5) Some priests hold Masses for the dead, on behalf of the living, that these may soon die. The priest who does this, and the person who induced him to do it, shall both be deposed and forever anathematised and excommunicated. Only on their deathbed may the communion be again administered to them.\n\n(6) All the year through, in all the twelve months, shall \"Exomologeseis\" (Litany) with intercessions be said for the Church, the King, and the people, that God may forgive them all.\n\n(7) The older laws for ensuring the safety of the royal family are renewed.\n\n(8) As the Jews have added to their other crimes this that they endeavoured to overthrow the country and the people, they must be severely punished. They have done this after they had (in appearance) received baptism, which, however, by faithlessness they have again stained. They shall be deprived of their property for the benefit of the exchequer, and shall be made slaves forever. Those to whom the King sends them as slaves must watch that they may no longer practise Jewish usages, and their children must be separated from them, when they are seven years of age, and subsequently married with Christians.\n\n"}

He considers himself an all-rounder and seeks to excel in bowling, batting and fielding. In August 2018, he was one of thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018–19 season by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).\n\nShaheen belongs to the Zakhakhel Afridi tribe of the Pashtuns.

Cannabis is locally known as \"weed\", and internationally Jamaica, its reggae music, and cannabis consumption play a prominent role in Jamaica's public image.\n\nA common stereotype about Jamaicans is that every Jamaican smokes marijuana.\n\nWhile Rastafari is a common religion among black Jamaicans that look up to the past Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, only 3% of the population practices this religion.\n\nThe population growth rate in Jamaica is at 0.7%, and it is considered to be an underpopulated country. On average, each woman gives birth to two children.\n\nJamaica is in a lot of debt; public debt has increased to 140% of the GDP, due to deficits and excessive debt service and borrowing. However, there have been improvements in procedures regarding to starting businesses, foreign investment is more available, and property rights are more secured.\n\nAnother stereotype is that all Jamaicans are black, but this is not the case.\n\n\n"}

His birth certificate (accessible through familysearch.org) his gravestone, commissioned by his family, and his first marriage registration (Washington, DC; January 13, 1947 under his birth name, Theodore Edwin Anderson, age given as 32) both support the 1914 year of birth. The Social Security Death Index cites 1921, and the California Death Index cites 1920, which indicate that in addition to changing his name professionally and legally he shaved some years off his true age. \n\nTheodore Edwin Anderson was born in ￼￼El Paso , Texas to Henry Anderson (1891-19??) and Lydia A. Anderson (née Apodaca; later Silverman; 1898-1986), who wed in Pima, Arizona on November 18, 1913. Ted and his sister, Gertrude Anderson (1916–1955), were raised in southern California; they both suffered untimely deaths and were predeceased by their mother, Lydia. He graduated from Los Angeles High School and Washington State College.\n\nAndrews began his career as Michael Ames at the Pasadena Playhouse and moved to New York City to appear onstage. Andrews acted with the Margo Jones Company in New York City from 1944 to 1948, when he was spotted by Joshua Logan. When Henry Fonda left the title role in \"Mister Roberts\", Logan gave Andrews the part in the road production.\n\nOn Broadway, Andrews played in \"Summer and Smoke\" (1948-1949) and \"A Girl Can Tell\". Billed as Michael Ames, he was in \"Quiet, Please!\" (1940), \"My Sister Eileen\" (1940-1943), \"Storm Operation\" (1944), \"Mrs. Kimball Presents\" (1944), \"Public Relations\" (1944), and \"That Old Devil\" (1944).\n\nHe returned to films in 1965, appearing as Captain Tuthill in Otto Preminger's World War II action blockbuster \"In Harm's Way\". In 1968, Andrews appeared on film in Ted Post's \"Hang 'Em High\" as a defense attorney. Two years later, he worked again with Post in \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\", as James Franciscus's dying commanding officer, Colonel 'Skipper' Maddox. His final screen appearance was as a doctor in 1973's \"The Baby\", also directed by Post.\n\nAndrews' television performances included a starring role from 1957 to 1958 in the syndicated series of the American Civil War, \"The Gray Ghost\", based on the heroic Confederate Colonel John Singleton Mosby. In 1959, he starred in the short-lived (13 episodes) \"Counterthrust\", a syndicated series \"in which he played a secret agent in the Far East battling Communism\".\n\nHe was cast in two episodes of the CBS sitcom, \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and in the 1962 series finale, \"The Hoax,\" of the ABC adventure series, \"Straightaway\", starring Brian Kelly and John Ashley.\n\nIn 1962, he portrayed the part of Holt in the episode \"The Devil and the Deep Blue\" on CBS's \"Rawhide\". In 1964, he appeared in \"The Bewitchin' Pool\", the last original broadcast episode of \"The Twilight Zone\". In 1973, Andrews played the President of the United States in the made-for-TV political thriller \"The President's Plane is Missing\".\n\nAndrews won a Theatre World Award in 1949 for his work in \"Summer and Smoke\".\n\nAndrews was married three times, to Gloria Eleanor Folland (December 3, 1921 – October 28, 1991), Alice Kirby Hooker, and Karolyn Rainwater (1943-1993). The first two marriages ended in divorce, and he was married to Rainwater when he died.\n\nAndrews died of a heart attack on November 7, 1972 in Los Angeles, California. He was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City. He was survived by, among others, his wife Karolyn, at least two children (some sources indicate three children), and his mother. Some sources indicate his father survived him as well but his father's year of death has not been established.\n\n"}
{"id": "20590712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20590712", "title": "Women in Anglo-Saxon society", "text": "Women in Anglo-Saxon society\n\nThe study of the role of women in particular in the society of Anglo-Saxon England has been a topic of academic research in history and gender studies since the 1980s. A seminal study was published by Christine Fell as \"Women in Anglo-Saxon England\" in 1984. According to Fell, women were \"near equal companions to the males in their lives, such as husbands and brothers, much more than in any other era before modern time\". Despite this sense of equality in some strata of society, Anglo Saxon women were still subject to concubinage.\nGender was influenced by social status, religion and sexuality.\nThey were not only allowed to have private influence, but also a wide liberty of intervention in public affairs.\n\nWomen and children were generally involved in tasks that required little physical work. Though, due to climate and weather constraints, women may have done the work that needed attention at the time.\n\nChurches in Anglo-Saxon England stressed doctrines that preached about virginity as a virtue and faithful monogamy; this is believed to have limited an individual’s chances of acquiring status, political power and property. Anglo-Saxon England was the first place in history that women had been raised to sainthood, and this was the strongest immediately following the acceptance of Christianity. Christianity provided lots of freedom for women. It helped them become powerful in society. Within the church women appeared to have been equal as well there are evidences of anti-feminism found in Homilies. Although anti-feminism was found in Homilies, it does not seem to hold true in practice. Women who went into the convent and took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience were glorified in the eyes of the Church and its Fathers. The convent offered self-development and social responsibility to women, something that women are fighting for today. Uniquely, the Anglo-Saxon church had institutions that consisted of male and female monasteries, located together but segregated, and in these the female abbot had the headship of the institution. Convents were run by abbesses, and this was an opportunity for women to have a position of authority. They were responsible for the finances and managing the property, with some the help of the other nuns. This control that women had did not survive the Viking invasion of 789, although women continued to play a major role in the church in late Anglo-Saxon England. Single gendered convents and monasteries had the chores that were commonly done by the other sex would have been performed by the common sex in that location; examples are men would have worked in the kitchens of monasteries and women would have worked in the gardens of nunneries.\n\nIt is clear that there were equal opportunities for men and women in the Christian Church in Anglo-Saxon England, but it is still important to look at the \"Patriarchs of the Bible.\" Although women were given these opportunities it is crucial that they were given them by men and that the Church's significant positions of authority were held by men. Thus the gender differences and coping with the ideological conflicts that have to do with sexuality and kinship resulted from the introduction of Christianity.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, there were many laws related to marriage. Some historians profess that the law that neither widow, nor maiden was forced to marry a man that she disliked as being a sign of equality; however, Aethelberht's law contradicts this in as much as a man is legally allowed to steal another man's wife as long as he pays him reparation. Once married, a woman was to situate herself as the object of her husband's subjectivity, she was to become the object of his protection and the property, although she still remained the owner of her property. The Church saw that married women had no authority and were to stand under the lordship of men. Therefore, under the church they were not able to teach, witness, take an oath, nor be a judge. In marriage, a male often developed his sphere of influence through his wife. Although women were seen as such under the church, there were laws that protected them in the public sphere when married. Divorce was rare, and the only documented ones were in times of adultery. A woman that commits adultery by sleeping with a man that was not her husband while he was still alive was subject to give what she owned to her husband. Æthelraed's 1008 code states that widows shall remain unmarried for 12 months after the death of her husband, at which point they have the freedom to choose. This was likely the case to allow for the widows have time to think and not make any rash decisions which may have led to relationships or commitments.\n\nA prospective husband had to offer his wife a valuable gift called the \"morgengifu\", a “morning-gift,” which consisted of paying money or giving land for the ladies’ hand in marriage. This was paid to her directly and she had the right to do with it as she pleased. It is made clear that the marriage finances were held by both man and woman. A woman was free to leave a marriage, keeping in mind the only times divorce was documented in cases of adultery; and if the woman did leave and take the children, she was entitled to half the property. These gifts were substantial sums and generally property. The gifts given by the groom were sometimes viewed as a sale of the bride, when, in actuality, it was to safeguard her interests and add security.\n\nAccording to the church sexual desires were evil and sinful, thus appeared as so; therefore women were not to enjoy sex. Many times sex was not gentle, because it was a sense of security for the man and not meant to please the woman. When it came to paying for sex with a woman belonging to the King she would have cost roughly 30 shillings, while a commoner only 6 shillings. The transfer of money for sex shows that there was the presence of prostitution, although it is not clearly stated whether the women condoned the act or not, and this issue is still up for debate; what is known is that there was a sex trade in some form. The fact that rape of a slave was more expensive than seduction of a free woman shows how rape was viewed so negatively in society, although the law protected women against both actions. Laws of Ælfred go into great detail regarding laws about sexual assaults. An example of the law committed by a man was King Æthebald of Mercia who was punished for numerous reasons, including violating holy nuns who were virgins consecrated to God. When compensation was paid a free woman, ceorl or ranked above, she collected the money directly, and the money for slaves went to their owner. It is also unclear as to whether the wife or husband received the money for their servants. Rape as a topic is important because it relates to gender relations, class status, property rights, judicial customs, female agency, religious virtues of integrity of the body and representation in of all of these in a society. Sexual assaults were greatly penalized whether it was a slave or free woman. Burials suggest that a raped body was unceremonious. A few documents suggest that some men of this era applauded other men who beat their wives and that some men even thought that a wife should be beaten regularly; this may have been condoned by clergy. Even though there were laws protecting women that had been raped, sometimes the acts went unpunished for lack of information or time. The victim herself may not have told anyone until many years after, or no one really took an interest in the crime if the victim was of the serving class.\n\nSex and rape were also found in literature. There are actual and threatened acts of violent sexual assaults present in some literature and legal texts; an example is the homily of Wulfstan, a text in which he wrote about women being raped at the hands of the Vikings.\n\nThe written law only represents a portion of the laws that impacted the lives of women; therefore they only reflect partial views of what actually happened. Despite what the churches doctrines taught, women were considered to be a member of the state and their rights were protected, regardless of their status as maiden, widow or wife. Women were classed as oath worthy and could appear as grantors, grantees and witnesses of charters. Women were held responsible and accountable under the law for their activity, although were not held accountable for any criminal activity that her husband did, unless she was a willing accessory to the crime. Along with being law abiding, they received appropriate compensation for crimes that were committed against them, and the compensation was paid directly to them.\n\nWomen had property rights and many landowners were women. They were able to bequeath land, as shown in numerous wills. Leaving property by means of a will was not restricted to kin; it could also be left to servants, religious figures, and churches. Documents of wills and charters show that women owned estates, by virtue of grant, will, or inheritance, and that they were seen roughly equal in the common life of the countryside. Evidence in these documents shows no preference to daughters or sons as heirs. Ceorl women and others of high rank were responsible for their homes. Some of the items that women would commonly receive via trust or inheritance were real property estates, slaves, livestock, household furnishings, clothing, jewels, and books. Items such as table clothes, bed sheets, and wall hangings were considered women's property because women made them.\n\nAnglo-Saxons had warnings for pregnant women, including avoiding foods that were too salty or sweet, pork, and other fatty foods. They were also told to abstain from strong alcohol and too much drink and to avoid travel on horseback. If a woman were to stop menstruating supposedly due to a lack of nutrients and was not pregnant, she was to take hot baths, drink hot herb teas, and dress warmly.\n\n\n"}
