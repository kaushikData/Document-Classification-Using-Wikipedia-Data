Together, these peoples are known as the Mbenga (\"Bambenga\") or Binga (\"Babinga\"), the latter derogatory.\n\nFamously, Aka shares vocabulary with the Baka languages, mostly concerning a specialised forest economy, such as words for edible plants, medicinal plants and honey collecting. This is among the 30% of Aka which is not Bantu and the 30% of Baka which is not Ubangian and has been posited as the remnant of an ancestral Western Pygmy (Mbenga or \"Baaka\") language which has otherwise vanished. However, it is entirely possible that the Aka shifted to Bantu from a Ubangian language related to Baka, in which case the situation reduces to a single ethnic group adapted to the forest with correspondingly specialised vocabulary. There is no evidence for a wider linguistic affiliation with any of the other Pygmy peoples.\n\nThe Aka people call themselves \"Mraka\" in the singular and \"Beka\" in the plural. The people and their language go by various alternate spellings: \"Mò-Áka, Moyaka, Bayaka, Yaga, Bayaga, Gbayaka, Biaka, Beká, Yakwa, Yakpa, Yakpwa, Nyoyaka.\" The western Aka are known as the Benzele (\"Mbenzélé, Babenzélé, Bambenzele, Ba-Benjelle\"), and the eastern Aka as the Sese (\"Basese\").

{"id": "30807158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30807158", "title": "Bakossi people", "text": "Bakossi people\n\nThe Bakossi people live on the western and eastern slopes of Mount Mwanenguba and Mount Kupe in the Bakossi Mountains of Cameroon. They number about 200,000, mostly engaged in subsistence farming but also producing some coffee and cocoa.\n\nAccording to their tradition, the Bakossi are descended from the great hunter Ngoe (or Ngweh) and his beautiful wife Sumediang. They had twelve children. At one time, a supernatural being warned the couple that a flood was coming and told them to make a box in which to escape. They built an ark, taking in their family and all kinds of animals, and survived the flood. The ark came to rest between the twin lakes of Mwanenguba, one of which is said to have a female character and the other male.\nThe different clans claim descent from different children and grandchildren of this couple.\n\nThe Bakossi are related to other people of the region including the Bafaw, Bakundu, Balong, Bassossi, Mbo, Abo, Miamilo, Baneka, Muaneman, Muange, Bareko, Bakaka, Babong, Balondo, Manehas, Bongkeng, and Bakem.\nThe Bakossi people speak a Bantu language called Akose.\nToday, this language includes many loan words from English, French and word that are also found or related to words in Douala.\nEthnologue classifies the language in the Ngoe group of the Lundu-Balong family.\n\nThe land occupied by the Bakossi people includes both highlands and lowlands. It has fertile soils, watered by streams that rise in the mountains, and is covered by dense forest which contain a wide variety of trees, birds and animals.\nMany of the Bakossi grow coco yam, cassava and some corn for food. For cash they cultivate coffee in the higher parts and cocoa lower down.\nMore exotic foods include tadpoles and males of the Hairy Frog, which are thought to fall from the sky and, when eaten, to help childless human couples become fertile.\nAmong the Bakossi, a hunter is respected for his skills and achievements as much as for the economic value of the animals he has managed to kill.\n\nThe Bakossi Forest Reserve of was created in 1956. In 2000, the main section of Bakossi was designated a protected forest. All logging was banned and Kupe became a \"strict nature reserve\". The local Bakossi people participated in delineating the boundaries.\nThere were large gains in management effectiveness of the forest between 2003 and 2007 although the local people are still not well integrated into management of the area and there are weaknesses in education on environmental subjects.\n\nThe Bakossi beliefs and customs included belief and participation in jujus, a rather vague concept where the name of a juju might apply to a secret society, objects such as masks associated with the society, and certain magical powers.\n\"Mwakum\" was the most powerful of all the jujus, invisible, mysterious and full of magic.\nSome jujus were restricted to men of a certain age and demanded an initiation fee.\nJujus and their ceremonies kept peace in the villages, warded off evils and detected the presence of witches.\n\nThe Bakossi people attached sinister magical properties to Mount Kupe.\nThey believed that \"Nyongo\", or members of the \"ekom\" association of witches, could put people to work on invisible plantations on the mountain.\nWhile still living, the future slaves would be given to a witch by a greedy relative in return for joining the association and gaining a plantation.\nAfter they appeared to die, but in fact became \"ekongi\", the relatives were stolen from their graves by the witches and sold to a plantation owner.\nThe practice of visiting a trader in ekongi is reported from 1962 in Douala, the commercial capital of Cameroon.\nThe \"ekongeur\" would throw his visitor into a deep sleep through hypnosis. He would see the plantations with the ekongi working, and would be offered a plantation in return for someone such as his mother. On waking up, the ekongeur would explain that he now should take his time to decide what he would do...\nThere may be an echo in this belief of early experiences with the slave trade.\n\nThe \"Nyongo\" could also find closed bundles on the mountain which might contain either riches or misfortunes, including illness and death. The bundle had to be brought back unopened and immediately thrown in the river if it was found to contain bad luck.\nBy the 1950s a belief had risen that anyone who could afford a modern house with a tin roof must be a \"Nyongo\", earning his wealth from the labors of his dead relatives. There was a reluctance to build such a house, even if the owner visibly did the work with his own hands and none of his relatives died. When a witch died, he could also become an \"ekongi\". To prevent this, he might be buried face down so he could not rise, perhaps with his head severed from his body.\nThese beliefs are now discredited. Heinrich Balz, in his 1984 study of the Bokassi, \"Where the Faith Has to Live\", reported that before dying the last \"Ekom\" men left a message that there was no longer anything good to be found on Koupe. To get wealthy the people should take their cutlasses and open farms in the bush.\n\nThe Bakossi observed a ten-day cycle rather than the seven-day week common elsewhere. As elsewhere, they did not align their weeks with months.\n\nThe different Bakossi tribes originally each occupied independent territories, living as hunter-gatherers.\nAs the Atlantic slave trade developed, the coastal town of Douala became an important trading center, reaching into the interior Bakossi Mountains along the Mungo valley. However, by the 1840s the slave trade had been replaced by the palm oil trade. Little is known about the effect on the Bakossi of either trade, but they were certainly involved in both. In nearby regions, slaves were still used domestically on palm oil plantations as gatherers, processors and carriers long after the export of slaves to the USA, Caribbean and Brazil had ceased.\n\nDuring the European colonial era, the Bakossi came under German rule in the 1880s, and then, after World War I, their land was split between British and French colonies.\nThe Mungo River, which flows through Bakossi territory, was taken as the southern boundary between the two colonies. Starting in the first half of the 20th century, Bamileke people began to migrate into Bakossi territory, particularly to the Tombel area, where they found work on the plantations and escaped the harsh forced-labor conditions on the French side of the border. They were welcomed by the Bakossi, who gave them land in return for free labor.\nThe use of laborers in this way was consistent with the Bakossi's memories of employing slave labor and their belief in the invisible slave plantations on Mount Kupe.\n\nIn 1953, the Kumba Eastern Area Federation was established as an indigenous authority covering all the Bakossi.\nIn the period immediately following World War II, the Bakossi people enjoyed a period of prosperity.\nCocoa prices were high, and the farmers did not have to work since they could employ a sharecropper to tend the crop in return for one-third of the earnings. With nothing else to spend their money on, the men would buy cases of Spanish gin and brandy, consuming the booze in long drinking bouts that lasted all night. By the 1960s, the hangover set in as the people started to realize the need to invest in more important things, particularly education and became aware that they may have lost control of their land.\n\nThe modern independent state of Cameroon was formed in 1961 when the southern part of the British Cameroons united with the Republic of Cameroon, which had succeeded the French colony of Cameroun in 1960.\nThe Bakossi were opposed to the union, and the Mwane-Ngoe Union of the Bakossi asked the United Nations to respect their wish to avoid the conflict in Cameroun and instead let them join Nigeria.\nAt first the Southern Cameroons retained a degree of independence in a federation between two states.\nFull unification was resisted by the people of Southern Cameroons since they had a more democratic society than prevailed in the rest of the country under the oppressive regime of Ahmadou Ahidjo.\nIn 1963, the Bangem District was created covering the land occupied by the Bakossi.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, tensions began to rise between the Bakossi and the Bamileke people, who were becoming increasingly successful as farmers. The UPC rebellion broke out in the French territory in 1955, with Bamilekes prominent among the rebels.\nA growing number of Bamileke fled from persecution in the east and settled with their kin in Bakossi country.\nAfter unification in 1961 the UPC rebels came under increasing pressure and their numbers shrank. The remainder turned to living off the land, demanding supplies from the villages and capturing youths whom they inducted into their forces.\n\nBy late 1966, medicine men were active in distributing secret medicines which would give the Bakossi men courage and make them immune to bullets or machete strokes. After three Bakossi were killed by unknown assailants on 31 December 1966, the Bakossi went on a rampage, killing 236 Bamileke settlers, looting and burning their houses.\nIn response the army moved in, rounded up all able-bodied Bakossi men in the Tombel area, and placed them in detention camps. Many were severely tortured to obtain confessions.\nEventually 143 Bakossi men were put on trial and 17 sentenced to death. 75 received life sentences of life imprisonment.\nBangem District was split into Northern and Southern districts in 1968, and, in 1977, the Bakossi Council was also split into Northern and Southern councils.\n\nCameroon is a poor country, with a 2010 GPD per capita of US$2,300, placing it 183 among countries by wealth. Most of the people are engaged in agriculture.\nAfter independence the government faced growing demand for rural water supply.\nThe government required that local communities provide labor to build the water facilities between 1964 and 1988, providing water through public taps. However, local councils found that the cost of supplying water to these taps was eating up a large part of their budget. When they failed to pay their bills the National Water Supply Company of Cameroun (SNEC) simply disconnected the supply.\nStarting in 1993 the SNEC tried privatizing the taps to reduce waste and recover costs, with an individual running the tap and selling the water. The Bakossi women of Tombel made a dramatic protest against these changes. In April 1994, 4,000 women marched on the SNEC offices, led by some old women who marched naked - their final weapon before death - and urinated on the steps. Herbs were thrown on the steps, which were said to be able to turn into poisonous snakes if anyone crossed the threshold. The SNEC employees had fled and refused to return from fear of the people and of the juju the women had placed. The outcome was partial success. Control of the water supply was given to a committee headed by the woman who had organized the protest. But the supply remained uncertain.\nAs of 2008, young Bakossi farmers faced the difficult choice of trying to make their way in the city or taking their chances in rural development. Some had started growing oil palms in Mbulle but lacked a processing machine, fertilizers and chemicals. Most important they lacked roads and transport to get their crops to market. Earlier cooperatives that gave some collective bargaining power had been disbanded leaving cash crop farmers at the mercy of private buyers.\n\nAlbert Ngome Kome was a leading political figure of the Bakossi people.\nHe was Minister of Transport from 8 November 1979 to 17 July 1984 under the governments of Ahmadou Ahidjo and his successor Paul Biya.\nA 2006 article described Kome as a member of the Kupe Muanenguba elite, which also included Mr Ekinde Sone Bernard Ivo an educationist and politician, Professor Elvis Ngolle Ngolle, appointed Minister of Forests and Wildlife on 22 September 2006, Chief Justice Epuli Aloh Mathias, Professor Charles Epie Alobwede, Professor Paul Ndue,Thomas Kolle Ekaney, Late Chief Lucas Nzuonkwelle, Ambassador Nkwelle Ekaney, Mr. Ngole Philip Ngwese, Makoge Ivo Charles, Nhon Mesue Stephen Nzuonkwelle, Nhon Nzuonkwelle Emmanuel Nkwelle, CD Ewu Ngeme David, Chief Ewange of Babubock, Mme Ngumbah née Mesue Juliana Mbende, Nicolas Nkwelle Metuge, Nhon Nkwelle Jude Nzuonkwelle,General Ekongwese Divine Nnoko appointed Military General on a presidential decree of June 29, 2017, Paul Elung chief Alex Ngome Ntoko, Chief Nhon Nzoh Ngandembou, Hon.

Critically acclaimed, it has been ranked third in the Australian \"Golf Digest\" Top 100 Courses rankings, and 24th in the world.\n\nAndrew Purchase bought the land in 2011. Extra land was required, which resulted in Victorian course owner Duncan Andrews investing in the project, and the Tasmanian Government making some public land available for lease. Golf course designer Mike De Vries designed the course, nine holes of which straddle the coastline. The windy climate necessitated the use of multiple types of fescue grasses for the greens. The course has cost $8 million to buy and construct. Covering around 120 hectares (300 acres), the course encroached on the nesting burrows of short-tailed shearwaters. Some of these were destroyed in the course's creation, however, the construction took place outside the breeding season while the birds were absent. The site owners reported that the birds dug new burrows in natural areas the next season, and that the course has prevented access to locals taking birds for food.\n\nThe course has been designed with wide fairways to accommodate for the strong westerly winds known as the Roaring Forties. Holes singled out for praise by ausgolf reviewer Gary Kennedy include the par five 9th hole, complete with ravine, the par three 11th hole alongside a rocky cove, and the picturesque 18th hole.

In one form, this fantasy sex is accomplished by the participants describing their actions and responding to their chat partners in a mostly written form designed to stimulate their own sexual feelings and fantasies. Cybersex often includes real life masturbation.\nEnvironments in which cybersex takes place are not necessarily exclusively devoted to that subject, and participants in any Internet chat may suddenly receive a message of invitation). The quality of a cybersex encounter typically depends upon the participants' abilities to evoke a vivid, visceral mental picture in the minds of their partners. Imagination and suspension of disbelief are also critically important. Cybersex can occur either within the context of existing or intimate relationships, e.g. among lovers who are geographically separated, or among individuals who have no prior knowledge of one another and meet in virtual spaces or cyberspaces and may even remain anonymous to one another. In some contexts cybersex is enhanced by the use of a webcam to transmit real-time video of the partners.\n\nCybersex is commonly performed in Internet chat rooms (such as IRC, talkers or web chats) and on instant messaging systems. It can also be performed using webcams, voice chat systems like Skype, or online games and/or virtual worlds like \"Second Life\". The exact definition of cybersex—specifically, whether real-life masturbation must be taking place for the online sex act to count as cybersex—is up for debate. It is also fairly frequent in online role-playing games, such as MUDs and MMORPGs, though approval of this activity varies greatly from game to game. Some online social games like \"Red Light Center\" are dedicated to cybersex and other adult behaviors. These online games are often called AMMORPGs.\n\nCybersex may also be accomplished through the use of avatars in a multiuser software environment. It is often called mudsex or netsex in MUDs. In TinyMUD variants, particularly MUCKs, the term TinySex (TS) is very common.\n\nThough text-based cybersex has been in practice for decades, the increased popularity of webcams has raised the number of online partners using two-way video connections to \"expose\" themselves to each other online—giving the act of cybersex a more visual aspect. There are a number of popular, commercials webcam sites that allow people to openly masturbate on camera while others watch them. Using similar sites, couples can also perform on camera for the enjoyment of others.\n\nIn online worlds like \"Second Life\" and via webcam-focused chat services, however, Internet sex workers engage in cybersex in exchange for both virtual and real-life currency.\n\nCybersex provides various advantages:\n\n\nCybersex is often criticized because the partners frequently have little verifiable knowledge about each other. For many the primary point of cybersex is the plausible simulation of sexual activity, and this knowledge of the other is not always desired, but this is also criticized as the emptying out of embodied relations.\n\nIn the words of Carkeek and James:\nPrivacy concerns are a difficulty with cybersex, since participants may log or record the interaction without the other's knowledge, and possibly disclose it to others or the public.\n\nThere is disagreement over whether cybersex is a form of infidelity. While it does not involve physical contact, critics claim that the powerful emotions involved can cause marital stress, especially when cybersex culminates in an Internet romance. In several known cases, Internet adultery became the grounds for which a couple divorced. Therapists report a growing number of patients addicted to this activity, a form of both Internet addiction and sexual addiction, with the standard problems associated with addictive behavior.\n\n\n"}

However, unlike a common-law marriage, the status is not equivalent to a marriage: the legal rights and obligations of a couple in a de facto union are different from those of a married couple.\n\nDe facto unions were first formally introduced for opposite-sex couples in \"Law no. 35/99\" of 1 July 1999, although some of the legal protections granted by the status already existed separately in various other laws, dating back to 1976. De facto unions were later extended to same-sex couples by \"Law no. 7/2001\" of 11 May 2001. On the same day, a law on \"economia comum\" (\"common economy\") was also implemented, granting protection to two or more persons that live in common economy with most of the rights of the de facto union, except welfare benefits.\n\nSince 5 June 2010, Portugal also recognizes same-sex marriage, with de facto unions remaining as an alternative to couples (same-sex or opposite-sex) who do not wish to marry.\n\nThere is no registration for the process. Rights can be claimed after a couple lives together for two years. An application of joint tax assessment can be made to prove the union but it is not required.\n\nPortuguese de facto unions terminate upon the death or marriage of one of the partners, or upon request of one of the partners.\n\nThe law covers housing arrangements, civil servants and work benefits, the option to choose a fiscal regime as married partners, and welfare benefits. Since 1 March 2016, couples of any sex married or unmarried can adopt children together.\n\nSince December 2006, same-sex couples (and opposite-sex couples) living in a de facto union are also recognized in the same way as married couples for citizenship applications and when a public servant wants to extend healthcare protection to the partner.\n\nSince 2007, a new Penal Code recognizes same-sex couples regarding domestic violence, the murder of a partner, refusal to testify in court against the partner and in all other situations where married couples are referred in the code.\n\nIn July 2009, the Portuguese Assembly, with support of all the parties on the left, approved a bill to extend certain rights enjoyed by married couples, including inheritance rights, to couples in a de facto union. On 24 August 2009, President Aníbal Cavaco Silva vetoed the bill.\n\nOn 9 July 2010, de facto union expansion law (that included inheritance rights, compensation and other benefits) passed the Portuguese Parliament and on 16 August 2010, President Cavaco Silva ratified the law.\n\n"}

Tensions between ethnic groups exist and have become violent on several occasions since independence.\n\nBesides native Burundians, other ethnic groups from elsewhere in Africa, Europe, and Asia are also represented in Burundi as a result of immigration.\n\nNative Burundians belong to one of the three major ethnic groups in Burundi: the Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa peoples. The historical origins of ethnic differentiation between Hutu and Tutsi are disputed, however members of both groups consider themselves distinct.\n\nThe Hutu are the largest ethnic group in Burundi, representing approximately 80 percent of Burundians. Historically, they lived as agriculturalists. Under Burundi's Tutsi-dominated postcolonial government between 1965 and 2001, the Hutu population was marginalised and subordinated to the Tutsi elites. The first Hutu to become head of state was Melchior Ndadaye in 1993, although he was assassinated shortly after taking power. Since the end of the Burundian Civil War (1993–2005), Hutus have been dominant in political life.\n\nTutsi represent approximately 19 percent of the national population. Historically, the Tutsi dominated political institutions in Burundi, including the nation's monarchy. They lived as pastoralists. Even after the abolition of the monarchy in 1966, the subsequent dictatorial regimes of Michel Micombero (1966–76), Jean-Baptiste Bagaza (1976–87), and Pierre Buyoya (1987–93) were dominated by Tutsi elites which often consciously discriminated against the Hutu majority.\nThe Twa are the smallest indigenous ethnic group in Burundi and are a pygmy people. There are estimated to be between 30–40,000 Twa living in Burundi (one percent of the national population). As an ethnic group, they have links to the pygmy peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They traditionally lived as hunter-gatherers and musicians but, following bans on hunting and land re-distribution, now often work as unskilled labourers. The Batwa have been economically and politically marginalised by the other two ethnic groups. They are often disproportionately poor and suffer from legal discrimination.\n\nSince Burundi became independent from Belgian colonial rule in 1962, it has seen extensive violence between members of the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. Ethnic violence peaked in 1972 when 100,000 people, mainly Hutu, were killed by the Tutsi regime in the Burundian Genocide. Twa have also been targeted, specifically in violence directed against the Tutsi with whom they are sometimes associated. Ethnic violence has often been attributed to the agitation of political factions attempting to consolidate their power, as well as to competition for resources. Burundi's ethnic tensions have been compared to those in Rwanda which saw similar ethnic tension between Hutu and Tutsi flare up into violence on several occasions, notably during the Rwandan Genocide.\n\nAs a measure to limit the possibilities for discrimination, the 2005 Burundian constitution prescribes ethnic quotas (usually 60 percent Hutu to 40 percent Tutsi) in certain government institutions, including the military. Three seats in each house of the Burundian government are allocated to the Twa.\n\nA significant number of recent immigrants live in Burundi. Most come from neighbouring Central African countries (especially the Congo, Tanzania, and Rwanda) but other come from West Africa. There are also European and Asian communities in the country numbering approximately 3,000 and 2,000 people respectively.\n\n"}

Many would share a room which could be full of mats to sleep on, or a canvas sheet stretched between two horizontal beams creating a series of hammock like beds. \n\nOccupants of flophouses generally share bathroom facilities and reside in very tight quarters. People who make use of these places are often transients. Quarters in flophouses are typically very small, and may resemble office cubicles more than a regular room in a hotel or apartment building. Some flophouses qualify as boarding houses, but only if they offer meals. \n\nAmerican flophouses date at least to the 19th century, but the term \"flophouse\" itself is only attested from around the early 1900s, originating in hobo slang. In the past, flophouses were sometimes called \"lodging houses\" or \"workingmen's hotels\" and catered to hobos and transient workers such as seasonal railroad and agriculture workers, or migrant lumberjacks who would travel west during the summer to work and then return to an eastern or midwestern city such as Chicago to stay in a flophouse during the winter. This is described in the 1930 novel \"The Rambling Kid\" by Charles Ashleigh and the 1976 book \"The Human Cougar\" by Lloyd Morain. Another theme in Morain's book is the gentrification which was then beginning and which has led cities to pressure flophouses to close.\n\nSome city districts with flophouses in abundance became well known in their own right, such as the Bowery in Manhattan, New York City. Since the middle 20th century, reforms there have gradually made flophouses scarcer. The resulting gentrification and higher real-estate value has further eroded the ability of flophouses and inexpensive boarding-style hotels to make a profit.\n\nCage homes, described as \"wire mesh cages resembling rabbit hutches crammed into a dilapidated apartment\", were built in Hong Kong in the 1950s for single working men from Mainland China. As of 2012, the number of impoverished residents in Hong Kong was estimated at 1.19 million, and cage homes, along with substandard housing such as cubicle apartments, were still serving a portion of this sector's housing needs. The combination of high rents and income inequality has been given as one reason that cage homes persist.\n\nMichael Adorjan, a University of Hong Kong criminology professor, has noted that \"The United Nations has called cage and cubicle homes an 'insult to human dignity.'\"\n\nCage hotels, a form of single room occupancy, were common in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century; an estimated 40,000 to 60,000 people lived in them during the winter. \n\nA 1958 survey by Christopher Jencks found that homeless men preferred cage hotels over shelters for reasons of privacy and security.\n\nA similar preference for cage hotels over shelters was reported in turn of the century New York City, where single working men ranked their housing preference in the following order: \n\n\"Regulatory efforts to combat low-cost 'cage hotels,' ... [has been] a driver of the expansion of the homeless population in US cities\", according to Jencks.\n\n"}

There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1900s as starting birth years and ending birth years in the mid-1920s.\n\nThis generation experienced much of their youth during rapid technological innovation (radio, telephone) amidst growing levels of worldwide income inequality and a soaring economy. After the Stock Market crashed, this generation experienced profound economic and social turmoil, which eventually culminated in World War II.\n\nDemographers William Stauss and Neil Howe coined the term \"G.I.

{"id": "1164691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1164691", "title": "GenderPAC", "text": "GenderPAC\n\nGenderPAC (the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition) was a LGBT rights organization based in Washington, DC working to ensure that classrooms, communities, and workplaces were safe places for every person to learn, grow, and succeed, whether or not they conform to expectations for masculinity or femininity. It was active from 1995 to 2009.\n\nGenerally considered the first national political organization devoted to issues of \"gender identity and expression\" and representing the transgender community, GenderPAC aimed to promote understanding of the connection between discrimination based on gender stereotypes and gender, sexual orientation, age, race and class. GenderPAC's major programs were Workplace Fairness, Gender Equality National Index for Universities & Schools (GENIUS) Congressional Diversity Pledge, GenderYOUTH Network, and the Children As They Are parenting network.\n\nThe organization argued that violence and discrimination based on gender variance was not limited to people who identified as trans. It was often, however, categorised as a transgender rights organization.\n\nGenderPAC's annual budget grew to $250,000 in its first five years of existence, and topped out at $1,200,000 when it ceased operations in 2009. Most of its revenue came from LGBT funders and also from corporate sponsorships, with small amounts from individual donor contributions and events.\n\nGenderPAC was founded in 1995 by Riki Wilchins as an association of existing transgender organizations, in response to a lack of inclusion of transgender and gender-variant issues by national gay and lesbian organizations, and grew quickly. Its areas of activism included incidents of discrimination against trans and gender-variant people, as well as youth and issues of workplace fairness.\n\nIn 1996, the group began holding National Gender Lobby Days, during which activists would meet with members of Congress to discuss discrimination and violence. One part of these events was a Congressional Diversity Pledge, which asked Members of Congress to affirm that their own office would not discriminate against employees because of their \"gender identity or expression.\" Signers included Jan Schakowsky, Jerrold Nadler, and Carolyn Maloney. Eventually almost 200 Members signed the Pledge, including two dozen Republicans and over a dozen Senators.\n\nIn 1997, GenderPAC produced \"The First National Study on Transviolence\", a large research project on violence against transgender and gender-variant people. It was cited in the political struggle for hate crime protections for trans people.\n\nGenderPAC was a member of the Hate Crimes Coalition that effected in 1999 the introduction of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, eventually passed in 2009. When the organization was founded, passing a trans-inclusive version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) was a priority. After GenderPAC visited Congressional offices in preparation for a Lobby Days event, with an HRC lobbyist along, allegations were offered by some transgender activists that Human Rights Campaign might have persuaded GenderPAC to shift its support to hate crime laws, saying that this would be more politically efficacious. However, GenderPAC fervently denied this, and no actual evidence for the allegations was ever provided.\n\nThe organization formally organized in 1999, with a new board of directors comprising individuals instead of groups, and received tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.\n\nGenderPAC held the first National Conference on Gender in 2001, coinciding with the sixth annual Gender Lobby Days; one speaker was NOW president Patricia Ireland. The June 2001 issue of \"Time\" named Wilchins one of 100 national innovators.\n\nIn 2006 with Global Rights, GenderPAC researched and published \"50 Under 30: Masculinity and the War on America’s Youth\". The first human rights report on fatal violence against gender-variant youth, \"50 Under 30\" documented an epidemic of violence that had claimed the lives of more than 50 young people aged 30 and under from 1996 to 2006. 82% were black or Latina/o, and virtually all were male-to-female transsexuals. Most were attacked by assailants within 5 to 10 years of their own age.\n\nIn 2008, with 17 new murders in just two years, the report was updated and reissued as \"70 Under 30\" help from the NYC Gay & Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, which eventually took over the project and integrated it into its annual hate crimes report. Over 100 national and local groups endorsed the findings of \"50 Under 30,\" which was also adopted by members of the Hate Crimes Coalition on Capitol Hill, and provided by HRC to members of sub-committee that marked up the Mathew Shepherd Hate Crimes Act. The report was used by the House Hate Crimes Subcommittee, the federal-level activist Hate Crimes Coalition, the International Association of Police Chiefs, and the NYC Anti-Violence Project.\n\nOn May 28, 2009, GenderPAC closed its doors and shut down its website, citing the number of other organizations now doing the work that it was originally created for. Its GenderYOUTH network and resources were transferred to Choice USA.\n\nGenderPAC exemplified what certain feminists opposed about queer rights movements and certain elements of gender studies: Sheila Jeffreys wrote that its aims ignored women in favor of \"transgenders, most of whom are men, and homosexuality,\" and that the organization's conception of gender as something that should be protected, and the basis for individuals rights that needed to be respected rather than eliminated, would serve to reinforce discrimination.\n\nConversely, other transgender rights organizations were angered by GenderPAC's rejection of the label of a transgender organization and to focus on trans issues. These latter criticized GenderPAC's reputed shift of focus away from a trans-inclusive ENDA at the supposed prompting of HRC, their unwillingness to engage with identity categories, and what they saw as a \"violation\" or exclusion of trans people through the use of their stories to raise money which was not spent primarily on trans issues.\n\nIn fact, GenderPAC's Board and constituency remained heavily transgender from its founding until it ceased operations. Wilchins proposed that the focus of a gender rights struggle to be about the issue of gender discrimination, rather than identity of transgender, which might leave out many of those who suffered discrimination. This view brought the organization to crisis when it took on the case of a self-identified \"butch lesbian\" who sought help after being repeatedly harassed at work and ultimately fired for allegedly looking \"too masculine.\" Many on the Board said GenderPAC should only help transgender-identified individuals; others, including Wilchins, maintained that it was the issue of gender discrimination, rather than individual identity, that was paramount. It was a divide that GenderPAC struggled to bridge during its entire time in existence, and in many ways came to define the organization.\n\n\n"}

The exact constitutional status of the state during this period has been a matter of scholarly and political dispute. The Oireachtas removed all references to the monarch from the revised constitution in 1936, but under statute law the British monarch continued to play a role in foreign relations, though always on the advice of the Irish government. The state did not officially describe itself as the Republic of Ireland until 1949, when the remaining links with the monarchy were abolished.\n\nThe state known today as Ireland is the successor-state to the Irish Free State which was established in December 1922. The Free State was governed, until at least 1936, under a form of constitutional monarchy. Under the Free State's constitution the King had a number of nominal duties, including exercising the executive authority of the state, appointing the cabinet and promulgating the law. However, all of these were delegated to the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, and in 1927 the King's title within Great Britain and Northern Ireland was changed by proclamation under the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act passed by the Westminster Parliament to \"George V, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India\".\n\nIn January 1936, George V died and was succeeded by his eldest son, who became Edward VIII. The new King's reign lasted only eleven months, and he abdicated in December of that year and was succeeded by his brother Prince Albert, Duke of York, who took the name George VI. The parliaments of independent members of the British Commonwealth were required to ratify this change in monarch, and the pro-republican government of the Irish Free State decided to use this opportunity to drastically change the constitution.\n\nThe day after the abdication was announced on 12 December 1936, the Free State constitution was amended to remove all mention of the King and abolish the office of governor-general. The following day, a separate statute permitted the King to sign international treaties and to accredit diplomatic representatives, where authorised by the Irish government.\n\nIn 1937 a new Constitution was adopted establishing the contemporary Irish state named simply \"Ireland\" and entrenching the monarch's diminished role, transferring many of the functions performed by the King until 1936 to a new office of President of Ireland, who was declared to \"take precedence over all other persons in the State\". However, the 1937 constitution did not explicitly declare that the state was a republic, nor that the President was head of state, and it allowed for the King to have a role in the state's external affairs. The state's ambiguous status ended in 1949, when the Republic of Ireland Act ended the King's remaining role in external affairs and declared that the state was a republic.\n\nThe status of the Head of the Irish State from 1936 to 1949 was largely a matter of symbolism and had little practical significance. This was because the roles of both the King and the President of Ireland were merely ceremonial, being exercisable only \"on the advice\" of the Government (Cabinet). However, one practical implication of explicitly declaring the state to be a republic in 1949 was that it automatically led to the state's termination of membership of the then British Commonwealth, in accordance with the rules in operation at the time.\n\nAs founded in 1922, the Irish Free State was headed by the monarch but most of his functions were performed on his behalf by the Governor-General. An amendment made to the Free State constitution in 1936 changed this. The Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolished the post of governor-general and transferred most of the monarch's functions to other organs of government. Thus, for example, the executive power was transferred directly to the Executive Council, the right to appoint the President of the Executive Council (head of government) was explicitly vested in Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament), and the power to promulgate legislation was transferred to the Ceann Comhairle (chairman) of the Dáil. However the constitutional amendment also provided, without mentioning the monarch specifically, for the state to be represented by him in external affairs with other countries and their representatives:\n\nThe nations referred to in Article 1 were the other members of the then British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom), who at that time all shared the same person as their monarch. The External Relations Act, adopted shortly after the constitutional amendment, gave life to this provision by providing that:\n\nThe Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, filled the gap left by the abolition of the governor-general by creating the post of a directly elected president. The President of Ireland was henceforth responsible for the ceremonial functions of dissolving the legislature, appointing the government, and promulgating the law. Unlike most heads of state in parliamentary systems, the President was not even the nominal chief executive. Instead, the role of exercising executive authority was explicitly granted to the government—in practice, to the Taoiseach. The constitution also, like the 1922 constitution that preceded it, contained many provisions typical of those found in republican constitutions, stating, for example, that sovereignty resided in the people and prohibiting the granting of titles of nobility.\n\nNonetheless the government of Éamon de Valera, despite its long-term goal of republicanising the Irish state, consciously chose not to declare a republic and decided to name the state simply \"Éire\" (or \"Ireland\"), rather than the \"Republic of Ireland\" or the \"Irish Republic\". Thus the new constitution did not explicitly declare that the President would be head of state, providing merely that he would \"take precedence over all other persons in the State\". Nor did the new document mention the word \"republic\". Most crucially, Article 29 of the new constitution mirrored Article 51 of its predecessor, by permitting the state to allow its external relations to be exercised by the King. Article 29.4.2 provided that:\n\nThis provision meant that the External Relations Act continued to have the force of law until the legislature decided otherwise, and so the monarch continued to represent the state abroad when empowered to do so.\n\nNonetheless from 1936 until 1949 the role of the King in the Irish state was invisible to most Irish people. The monarch never visited the state during that period and, due to the abolition of the office of governor-general, had no official representative there. The President, on the other hand, played a key role in important public ceremonies.\n\nAsked to explain the country's status in 1945, de Valera insisted that it was a republic. He told the Dáil that:\n\nReferring to the External Relations Act he insisted that:\n\nDespite de Valera's views, many political scholars consider representing a nation abroad to be the key defining role of a head of state. This view was echoed by the Taoiseach John A. Costello in a debate in Seanad Éireann (the Irish Senate) in December 1948, when he argued that the Republic of Ireland Bill he was introducing would make the President of Ireland the Irish head of state. Despite this conflict, de Valera's party, as the main opposition in the Dáil at the time, decided not to oppose Costello's bill.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949, the 33rd anniversary of the beginning of the Easter Rising, was remarkable in that it purported to reform the state into a republic without making any change to the constitution, the ambiguous provisions of which remained unaltered. The Republic of Ireland Act contained three major provisions; it declared that: the External Relations Act was repealed, the state was a republic, and the external relations of the state would henceforth be exercised by the President.\n\nThe act also had the effect of automatically terminating the state's membership of the Commonwealth. The fact that he was now clearly and unambiguously the Irish head of state was celebrated by President Seán T. O'Kelly by visits to the Holy See and France. A visit to meet George VI at Buckingham Palace was also provisionally planned, but timetabling problems with the President's schedule prevented the meeting.\n\nThe King's title in the Irish Free State (1922–1937) and in Ireland (1937–1949) was the same as it was elsewhere in the Commonwealth, being:\n\n\nThe King's title during this period was never simply \"King of Ireland\". Traditionally, at least from the reign of William II, in England, and after the Union with Ireland, the monarch's style as king had included \"by the grace of God\". Initially, the English king's title in Ireland was \"Lord of Ireland\". The change from \"Lord\" to \"King\" of Ireland was made by the Crown of Ireland Act 1542 passed by the Irish Parliament, the same act describing it as being \"united and knit to the imperial crown of the Realm of England\". Soon after the passing of that act, the new title was proclaimed in London as: \"Henry VIII, by the grace of God King of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England and also in Ireland in Earth the Supreme Head\"; and this was confirmed by an act of ratification passed by the parliament in England in 1544. The opening words of Ireland's superseding constitution of 1937 were \"In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred\", and there was no mention in it of the king or monarch.\n\nAfter India and Pakistan became independent Dominions on 15 August 1947, the title \"Emperor of India\" was officially abandoned on 22 June 1948, although George VI remained monarch of India until 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth, the first Commonwealth country to do so.\n\nOutside the Irish state, \"Great Britain, Ireland\" was not officially omitted in the royal title until 1953. Then, each Commonwealth realm adopted a unique title for the monarch. No mention of Ireland was made in any except in the title within the United Kingdom and its dependent territories: it was changed from \"[Queen] of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas\" to \"[Queen] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories\".\n\n"}

The first Japanese explorers arrived in the Marshall Islands in the late 19th century, although permanent settlements were not established until the 1920s. As compared to other Micronesian islands in the South Pacific Mandate, there were fewer Japanese who settled in the islands. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Japanese populace were repatriated to Japan, although people of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage remained behind. They form a sizeable minority in the Marshall Islands' populace, and are well represented in the corporate, public and political sectors in the country.\n\nThe earliest Japanese contact with the Marshall Islands dates back to 1884, when a group of pearl divers were blown off course to Lae Atoll during their return voyage from Australia. The pearl divers were believed to be murdered, after the \"Ada\", a British trading ship sailed past the Marshall Islands and found the skeletal remains of the pearl divers. When news of the purported murder reached the Japanese government, two Japanese envoys–Goto Taketaro (a son of Goto Shojiro) and Suzuki Tsunenori were sent to the Marshall Islands. The envoys reportedly explored some of the nearby atolls before paying a visit to Labon Kabua, one of the principal chief in the Marshall Islands. Before Goto and Suzuki returned for Japan, they induced Kabua to raise the Japanese flag over his house at Ailinglaplap. The Japanese government subsequently ordered the two envoys to return to the island to haul down the flag upon the envoys' return. During the German colonial era, there were occasional reports of Japanese fishermen making landfalls in the atoll, and there was at least one other incident which Japanese fishermen were also killed by the islanders. A report published by a German explorer, Hambruch in 1915 mentioned that three Japanese fishermen in a junk were massacred by the Marshallese at Lae Atoll in 1910.\n\nA military administration was established when Japan annexed the Marshall Islands from Germany in 1914. The Japanese government subsequently dispatched a few administrators to the Marshall Islands. Between 1915 and 1918, a few Japanese businessmen from the South Seas Trading Company (\"Nanyo Boeki\") sailed to the Marshall Islands and established a few trading stations at Rongrong, Talab and Majuro village. A typhoon struck Majuro in 1918 and the businessmen relocated their trading posts to Jaluit. The civilian administration was established at Jabat Island and replaced the military administration in 1922. A small branch government office was established; and local Japanese settlers opened a small copra plantation on the island.\n\nIn the early 1920s, a Japanese trader settled in Enewetak and made false claims that he had received permission from the government to develop coconut groves. The natives initially worked for the trader, but resisted after realising the trader's false claims. There was no permanent official at Enewetak and Ujelang, but a ship from Pohnpei would make occasional visits to the islands. Japanese traders avoided Majuro until 1926, although Japanese ships made occasional stops on the atoll. A Japanese sailor settled on Majuro and started a store in 1926, and throughout the 1930s three more independent enterprises sprung up while two trading companies–\"Nanyo Boeki\" and \"Kaneko\" each established a branch store in Majuro village. The number of Japanese enterprises remained small throughout the Japanese colonial era, as the civilian administration experienced difficulties in acquiring unused land from the Marshallese chiefs. The first Okinawan fishermen arrived in Jaluit in the 1920s, and Jaluit experienced a steady influx of Japanese settlers from Kyushu and Okinawa from 1930s onwards. In the early 1930s, Marshallese reported a strong presence of Japanese and Korean labourers in Jaluit who were hired to build roads and shophouses. The regional headquarters was relocated to Jaluit from Jabat. Jaluit developed into a small town by 1939, and housed a population of several hundred Japanese settlers along with some two thousand Marshallese in the suburban areas.\n\nThe Japanese navy developed military bases in the atolls in the early years of World War II. During this time, the military brought in several thousand Japanese, Okinawan and Korean labourers to undertake the construction of military facilities. Some Marshallese and Koreans reported of maltreatment by the Japanese authorities, and there was at least one case of revolt by both groups at Jelbon on Mili Atoll in which a hundred Japanese civilians and soldiers were killed. When American troops attacked the Marshall Islands between January and April 1944, Japanese troops evacuated many Japanese settlers and Korean labourers from the atolls. A few were reportedly killed in the ensuing air raids, while others who remained behind were captured as Prisoners of war after the Americans captured the atolls, together with some Japanese soldiers.\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender, the Japanese population on the islands was repatriated back to Japan. People of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage generally stayed behind, although a few were granted an option if they were above 16 years old. The Japanese–Marshallese quickly assimilated with the Marshallese in the years after the war. Many of them became politicians and businessmen, and in the 1970s people of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage controlled most of the private enterprises in the state. Japanese–Marshallese politicians generally held critical opinions on nuclear weapon tests carried out by the United States in Operation Crossroads. At least one ethnologist, Greg Dvorak suggested that the shared Japanese and Marshallese experience of nuclear warfare shaped critical views held by Japanese–Marshallese politicians. From the 1990s onwards, Japanese–Marshallese politicians including James Matayoshi and Hiroshi Yamamura often led lobbies against the United States for monetary compensation of victims of radioactive fallout.\n\nWhen Marshall Islands became independent in 1986, second and third-generation Japanese–Marshallese offsprings formed the Japanese–Marshallese association (also known as \"Marshall Nikkeijin Kai\" in Japanese), and rendered assistance to families of Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War. Although the association had limited patronage from the younger generation of Japanese–Marshallese, it played an important role in lobbying the government to forge closer cultural and economic ties with Japan. Japanese firms that were based on the Marshall Islands since the 1960s actively sought joint ventures with local companies from the 1980s onwards, mainly in the fishery sector. Expatriates usually consisted of Okinawan fishermen based at Majuro, where Japanese companies have built smoking and canning facilities to facilitate the processing of tuna catches.\n\nThe Marshall Islands remained sparsely populated by Japanese settlers, relative to the other mandated Micronesian islands. The first pre-war census of the Marshall Islands counted 490 Japanese among 10,000 Marshallese, and the number of Japanese settlers increased to 680 scattered across all 33 atolls in 1940. Within the same year, the mandated islands had a total Japanese population of 77,000. The largest towns in the Marshall Islands, Jaluit and Jabor, had a thousand Japanese each, while in the most isolated atolls, the Japanese populace amounted to no more than a few individuals. Korean labourers were also counted recognised as Japanese in official statistics, and accounted for another 1,200 individuals which were brought into the Marshall Islands during the war. There was a sizeable minority of people of mixed Japanese and Marshallese heritage, which was more common in settlements with a smaller Japanese populace. In official census, people of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage are identified by their Marshallese heritage from 1945 onwards. The Marshallese ambassador to the United States, Banny de Brum cited in 2006 that some 6,000 individuals, or about 10% of all Marshall Islanders had some Japanese ancestry.\n\nJapanese was extensively used for day-to-day communication during the colonial era by both Japanese and Marshallese, but was replaced by Marshallese after the Japanese surrender. Japanese is still preferred as a second language over English among those of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage, and islanders occasionally adopt Japanese loanwords for certain terms in the Marshallese language.\n\nAt least one Shinto shrine or Buddhist temple was found in each settlement with a sizeable Japanese populace. In Jaluit, Wotje, Kwajalein, Enewetak and Maloelap, several Shinto shrines were built during the 1930s. When the Americans invaded the Marshall Islands in 1944, all the existing Shinto shrines were either destroyed in air raids, or were demolished. People of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage subsequently adopted Christianity in favour of Buddhism or Shinto after the Japanese surrender.\n\nAs compared to other Micronesian islands, most Marshallese adopted Japanese customs within the first few years of the Japanese administration. An Australian journalist travelling on a Burns Philp steamer noted that the most Marshallese women wore the kimono instead of the traditional loincloth (\"lavalava\" in Marshallese) in October 1918. Interethnic relations between the Japanese settlers and civil servants with the Marshallese were friendly, but racial segregation was enforced between Japanese and Micronesians in the workforce and educational sectors. As compared to Micronesians from other islands, Marshallese generally retained more aspects of their traditional lifestyles, relative to the small Japanese populace in the islands. Contrary to Japanese settlements in the other mandated islands, settlers consisted mainly of single men, and intermarriages with Marshallese women were much more frequent. Japanese songs such as \"Masaharu Gunto\" were written in the 1930s and reflected of romantic associations between Japanese men and Marshallese women. Ethnic suspicion and hatred by the Marshallese against the Japanese settlers developed during the Second World War, as the Japanese civilian government placed increased emphasis on militarism and forcibly conscripted many Marshallese to menial labour during the Second World War. Shortly before the end of the war, a few Marshallese led independent and isolated attacks against Japanese military personnel wherever possible.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35211741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35211741", "title": "Nabulsi soap", "text": "Nabulsi soap\n\nNabulsi soap (, \"ṣābūn Nābulsi\") is a type of castile soap produced only in Nablus in the West Bank, Palestine. Its chief ingredients are virgin olive oil (the main agricultural product of the region), water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The finished product is ivory-colored and has almost no scent. Traditionally made by women for household use, it had become a significant industry for Nablus by the 14th century. In 1907 the city's 30 Nabulsi soap factories were supplying half the soap in Palestine. The industry declined during the mid-20th century following destruction caused by the 1927 Jericho earthquake and later disruption from the Israeli military occupation. As of 2008, only two soap factories survive in Nablus. The old Arafat soap factory has been turned into a Cultural Heritage Enrichment Center.\n\nNabulsi soap was traditionally made by women for household use, even before the appearance of small soap-making factories in the 10th century. Trade with Bedouins was indispensable for soap-making, both in Nablus and Hebron, since they alone could furnish the alkaline soda (\"qilw\") required by the process. By the 14th century a significant soap-making industry had developed in Nablus and the soap, reputedly prized by Queen Elizabeth I of England, was exported throughout the Middle East and to Europe.\n\nThe 19th century saw a major expansion of soap manufacturing in Nablus, which became the center of soap production throughout the Fertile Crescent. By 1907, the city's 30 factories were producing nearly 5,000 tons of Nabulsi soap annually, over half of all soap production in Palestine. John Bowring wrote of Nabulsi soap in the 1830s that it is, \"highly esteemed in the Levant,\" and Muhammad Kurd Ali, a Syrian historian, wrote in the 1930s that \"Nablus soap is the best and most famous soap today for it has, it seems, a quality not found in others and the secret is that it is unadulterated and well produced.\"\n\nThe soap industry in Nablus began to decline in the mid-20th century, caused in part by natural disasters, especially a 1927 earthquake which destroyed much of the Old City of Nablus, and in part by Israeli military occupation. Israeli military raids during the Second Intifada destroyed several soap factories in the historic quarter of Nablus. Several soap factories remain in Nablus; currently, products are sold primarily in Palestine and the Arab countries, with some fair-trade exports to Europe and beyond. On the continuing problems both in terms of the soap's manufacture and its export. The General Manager of the factory owned by the Touqan family commented in 2008:\n\nBefore 2000, our factory used to produce 600 tons of soap annually. Due to the physical and economic obstacles we face now because of the Israeli occupation – and especially the checkpoints – we produce barely half that amount today.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the checkpoints and road blocks set up throughout the West Bank have created problems in the transportation of supplies and material to and from the factories as well as making it difficult for workers to get from their homes to the factories. However, Nabulsi soap is still widely sold in Nablus and the West Bank. It is also exported to Jordan, Kuwait, and Arab-Israeli cities such as Nazareth.\n\nConsidered an important aspect of Nablus's cultural heritage, the preservation of the Nabulsi soap-making industry has been the focus of several local projects, including the restoration and conversion of the old Arafat soap factory into a Cultural Heritage Enrichment Center. The center has research and exhibition facilities and includes a small model soap factory which makes Nabulsi soap using traditional methods. Project Hope and other local non-governmental organizations market the soap in the West to raise funds for their other community projects.\n\nLike Castile soap, the chief ingredients of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound is made by mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (\"qilw\") which grows along the banks of the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (\"sheed\"). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a \"dukshab\" is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.\n\nThe finished product is ivory-colored and has almost no scent. (Perfumes are never used in Nabulsi soap.) Before leaving the factory, the individual cubes which are to be sold locally are wrapped by hand in paper which is waxed on one side. Cubes which are destined for export are left unwrapped and usually dispatched in stiff sacks to protect them from damage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "302912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302912", "title": "Nanny", "text": "Nanny\n\nA nanny provides child care within the children's family setting. Traditionally, nannies were servants in large households and reported directly to the lady of the house. Today, modern nannies, like other domestic workers, may live in or out of the house, depending on their circumstances and those of their employers. There are many employment agencies that specialize in childcare.\n\nNannies differ slightly from others child care providers. A childminder works out of her own home, operating as a small business; depending on the country they live in, government registration may or may not be required. A mother's helper, who may live in or out, assists the woman of the house with general chores as well as caring for the children. The term \"au pair\" usually refers to an untrained young woman (or occasionally man), who comes from abroad to live in the host family and learn the local culture and language, while helping with the children. A governess concentrates on educating children inside their own home, and a Kindergarten or schoolteacher does the same, but in a school environment. \n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, the position was usually known as a \"nurse\", and was, as for many childcare jobs, invariably female. (Originally, the hired woman would have been expected to breastfeed the infant, a role known as a wetnurse.) In a great house (such as an English country house or town house), the nurse was a senior member of the household staff and ran her own domain, a suite of rooms called the nursery, supported by at least one assistant, known as a nursemaid (or nurserymaid). Because of their deep involvement in raising the children of the family, nannies were often remembered with great affection and treated more kindly than the junior servants. Nannies may have remained in the employment of the same aristocratic or gentry family for years, looking after successive generations of children.\n\nNannies were present in the households of the administrators of European colonial empires throughout the world. It was a characteristic feature of colonial society that the children of European administrative officers were entrusted to the care of native women.\n\nNannies in colonial times spent their lives in the homes of their masters, often from childhood till old age, taking care of more than one generation, depending on the duration of the post. It was not uncommon for these nannies to be brought along with the family away from their native country when administrative officers were posted \"home\" or to another colony.\n\n\nA \"live-in\" nanny is much less common than it once was though still ideal for a woman or man looking to move interstate or abroad for either a short period of time or to set themselves up. Typically, a live-in nanny is responsible for the entire care of the children of their employers. This includes anything from washing the children's clothes and tidying the children's rooms, to supervising homework and preparing children's meals, as well as taking children to and from school and after-school sport and/or activities. The job may include a separate apartment (sometimes called a \"nanny flat\") and a car. While a live-in nanny was commonly available 24 hours a day in the past this is much less common now and often they are 10-12 hours on and the remainder of the day off (essentially while the children are awake and the parents are at work). A live-in nanny is nowadays more common amongst wealthier families, because of their possible flexibility while they live where they work. A live-in Nanny will have all her living expenses paid and provided by the employer.\n\nSome families use what is known as a 'nanny share', where two or more families pay for the same nanny to care for the children in each family on a part-time basis.\n\nA more recent addition to the role of the nanny is that of the night nanny. Sleep specialists or consultants typically work with older babies and children. The night nanny usually works with a family anywhere from one night to seven nights per week. A night nanny generally works with children from newborn to five years of age. A night nanny can provide a teaching role, helping parents to establish good sleeping patterns or troubleshooting the sleeping patterns of a child. Roles and qualifications vary between countries. The Night Nanny works together with the family's requirements and philosophies. The qualifications of a night nanny are usually in mothercraft nursing (see sleep guidance specialist or early childhood development). Pay rates vary from country to country but are usually well paid in comparison to the general nanny, as the night nanny is seen as a specialist or expert in their field. \n\nHistorically, European women were confined to their beds or their homes for extended periods after giving birth; care was provided either by her female relatives (mother or mother-in-law) or by a temporary attendant known as a monthly nurse. These weeks were called confinement or lying-in, and ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the churching of women. A modern version of this rest period has evolved, to give maximum support to the new mother, especially if she is recovering from a difficult labor and delivery.\n\nIn the US these specialty maternity nannies are also known as Newborn Care Specialists (NCS, disassociating this specialty from medically qualified nursing). Certified Newborn Care Specialists or maternity nannies are highly educated and referenced specialists who work with infants. They are highly experienced in all aspects of newborns aside from medical issues. They might work 24 hours a day, seven days per week, but most work five nights/days a week for the first three months of a newborn's life. The role can consist of assisting parents with feeding guidance, nursery set up, premature infant, multiples, colic, reflux, and sleep guidance/training. There are various training organizations that offer non-accredited certifications, however, in an unregulated field parents should ensure that the qualifications of their maternity nanny are legitimate and accredited. The Newborn Care Specialist Association (NCSA) (http://www.ncsainfo.com) is one of many self-appointed certification entities for Newborn Care Specialists in America. Some doulas specialize in postpartum care for mother and baby.\n\nChinese and related East Asian traditions practice a form of postpartum confinement known as \"zuo yue zi\" \"sitting the month\". Newborn care specialists are referred to as \"yue sao\". They have specialised knowledge of both baby care and Zuo Yue Zi, which are the Chinese traditions and customs regarding recovery from childbirth. In Singapore and Malaysia, newborn care specialists are better known as confinement nanny. They assist the mother in taking care of the baby in order to let mother have a good rest. Confinement food will be prepared to help with the recovery. Confinement agency or the parents will need to apply for confinement nanny work permit if they want to engage the nanny from Malaysia to work in Singapore. Usually, the employment period will be about 28 days up to a maximum of 16 weeks.\n\nTypically, women from their 20s to 60s take up employment as nannies. Some are younger, though normally younger workers are nursemaids or au pairs rather than nannies in the traditional use of the term.\n\nA few positions are filled by men; the term \"manny\" is sometimes used for a male nanny, especially in the US and UK.\n\nThere are a number of national and international professional associations representing nannies and nanny agencies. The International Nanny Association (INA) was founded in 1985. INA is a non-profit organization which provides an educational association for nannies with placement, employment, and professional support. The Alliance of Professional Nanny Agencies (APNA) was founded in 1993. It is a non-profit organization that promotes professionalism in the nanny placement industry.\nIn June 2012 the Australian Nanny Association (ANA) was formed in Australia with the aims of having professional nannies included in the regulated government subsidized childcare scheme of the country. ANA is a volunteer run, not for profit association that also hopes to change some public misconceptions about nannies, encourage professionalism and be a source of support to nannies and the families who employ them.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, no formal qualifications or training are required to become a nanny. However, the National Nursery Examination Board (NNEB) was founded in 1945, as the awarding body in qualifications for childminders , and nursery personnel. In 1994 the NNEB and the Council for Early Years Awards (CEYA) merged to form CACHE – The Council for Awards in Children's Care and Education, with their CACHE Level 3 Diploma in Child Care and Education providing the knowledge and understanding of child development and education needed to work as a Nanny.\n\nNorland College is a private college near Bath, which offers highly regarded training as a nanny. It also operates its own employment agency for graduates, as well as a local nursery in Bath.\n\nIn the United States, no formal qualifications are required to be a nanny . However, nannies in the US now have access to online CACHE Endorsed Training created by 2004 International Nanny Association Nanny of the Year and parenting author Michelle LaRowe . This training is offered through a partnership with NannyTraining.com and Nanny Stella, Inc., the only US Based CACHE Endorsed Training Centre for the early years .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious television programs feature real nannies, many of whom help parents discipline children. These include \"Abismo de pasión\" (in Spanish), \"Nanny 911\", \"Supernanny\", and \"Take Home Nanny\".\n\n\n"}

This type of \"tubâ\" is called \"bahal\" (for \"tubâ\" aged this way for up to six months) and \"bahalina\" (for \"tubâ\" aged thus for up to a year or more). \"Toddy\" is also consumed in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, where in Sri Lanka it is known as \"thal ra (වල් රා), kithul ra ගල් රා), or pol ra (පොල් රා)\" according to the plant used to make toddy.\n\nThe sap is extracted and collected by a tapper. Typically the sap is collected from the cut flower of the palm tree. A container is fastened to the flower stump to collect the sap. The white liquid that initially collects tends to be very sweet and non-alcoholic before it is fermented. An alternative method is the felling of the entire tree. Where this is practiced, a fire is sometimes lit at the cut end to facilitate the collection of sap.\n\nPalm sap begins fermenting immediately after collection, due to natural yeasts in the air (often spurred by residual yeast left in the collecting container). Within two hours, fermentation yields an aromatic wine of up to 4% alcohol content, mildly intoxicating and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.\n\nPalm wine may be distilled to create a stronger drink, which goes by different names depending on the region (e.g., \"arrack\", \"village gin\", \"charayam\", and \"country whiskey\"). Throughout Nigeria, this is commonly called \"ogogoro\". In some parts in Cameroon it is known as \"Afofo\". In parts of southern Ghana distilled palm wine is called \"akpeteshi\" or \"burukutu\". In Togo and Benin it is called \"sodabe\", in the Philippines it is called \"lambanog\", while in Tunisia it is called \"lagmi\". In coastal parts of Kenya, it is known as \"chang'aa\". Chang'aa can be applied to wounds to stop heavy bleeding (mechanism of action not known). In Ivory Coast, it is called \"koutoukou\".\n\nIn Africa, the sap used to create palm wine is most often taken from wild datepalms such as the silver date palm (\"Phoenix sylvestris\"), the palmyra, and the jaggery palm (\"Caryota urens\"), or from oil palm such as the African Oil Palm (\"Elaeis guineense\") or from \"Raffia palms\", \"kithul\" palms, or \"nipa\" palms. In part of central and western Democratic Republic of the Congo, palm wine is called \"malafu\". Palm wine tapping is mentioned in the novel \"Things Fall Apart\" by the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe and is central to the plot of the novel \"The Palm Wine Drinkard\" by Nigerian author Amos Tutuola.\nPalm wine plays an important role in many ceremonies in parts of Nigeria such as among the Igbo (or Ibo) peoples, and elsewhere in central and western Africa. Guests at weddings, birth celebrations, and funeral wakes are served generous quantities. Palm wine is often infused with medicinal herbs to remedy a wide variety of physical complaints. As a token of respect to deceased ancestors, many drinking sessions begin with a small amount of palm wine spilled on the ground (\"Kulosa malafu\" in Kikongo ya Leta). Palm wine is enjoyed by men and women, although women usually drink it in less public venues.\n\nIn parts of southeastern Nigeria, namely Igboland, palm wine is locally referred to as “mmanya ocha” (literally, “white drink”), with “ngwo” and “nkwu” variants. It plays a very important role in traditional Igbo settings. In Urualla, for instance, and other “ideator” towns, it is the drink of choice for traditional weddings. A young man who is going for the first introduction at his in-laws’ house is required to bring palm wine with him. There are varying gallons of palm wine required, depending on the customs of the different regions in Igboland. This culture can be observed in a similar fashion in the neighbouring north-western regions of Cameroon. (North West Region).\n\nThere are four types of palm wine in the central and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. From the oil palm comes \"ngasi\", \"dibondo\" comes from the raffia palm, \"cocoti\" from the coconut palm, and \"mahusu\" from a short palm which grows in the savannah areas of western Bandundu and Kasai provinces.\n\nIn India and South Asia, coconut palms and Palmyra palms such as the \"Arecaceae\" and \"Borassus\" are preferred. It is mainly produced from the lala palm (\"Hyphaene coriacea\") by cutting the stem and collecting the sap. In some areas of India, palm wine is evaporated to produce the unrefined sugar called jaggery.\n\nIn parts of India, the unfermented sap is called \"neera\" (\"pathaneer\" in Tamil Nadu) and is refrigerated, stored and distributed by semi-government agencies. A little lime (calcium hydroxide) is added to the sap to prevent it from fermenting. \"Neera\", similar to fruit-juice products. is relatively rich in potassium.\n\nIn India, palm wine or toddy is served as either \"neera\" or \"pathaneer\" (a sweet, non-alcoholic beverage derived from fresh sap) or \"kallu\" (a sour beverage made from fermented sap, but not as strong as wine). Palm sap contains natural yeasts, which perform the fermentation of glucose to alcohol, as well as acetobacter, which subsequently converts the alcohol to acetic acid (vinegar). Optimal consumption time is one day after tapping, when the vinegar content is minimal; beyond this time, it becomes increasingly sour. Some palm wine drinkers prefer their beverage more sour than usual, but fermenting for too long while result in vinegar rather than wine. Refrigeration extends beverage life, as do a variety of spices, which also contribute flavor.\n\nIn India, palm wine is usually available at toddy shops (known as \"Kallu Shaap\" in [Malayalam], \"Kallu Kadai\" in [Tamil], \"Kalitha Gadang\" in Tulu, \"Kallu Dukanam\" in Telugu, \"Kallu Angadi\" in Kannada or \"Liquor Shop\" in English). In Tamil Nadu, this beverage is currently banned, though the legality fluctuates with politics. In the absence of legal toddy, moonshine distillers of arrack often sell methanol-contaminated alcohol, which can have lethal consequences. To discourage this practice, authorities have pushed for inexpensive \"Indian Made Foreign Liquor\" (IMFL).\nIn states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh (India), toddy is a popular drink in rural parts that is frequently consumed at the end of the day after work.\n\nThere are two main types of \"kallu\" in states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, namely \"Thadi Kallu\" (from Toddy Palmyra trees) and \"Eetha Kallu\" (from silver date palms). \"Eetha Kallu\" is very sweet and less intoxicating, whereas \"Thati Kallu\" is stronger (sweet in the morning, becoming sour to bitter-sour in the evening) and is highly intoxicating. People enjoy \"kallu\" right at the trees where it is brought down. They drink out of leaves by holding them to their mouths while the Goud pours the \"kallu\" from the \"binki\" (\"kallu\" pot). There are different types of toddy (\"kallu\") according to the season: 1. \"poddathadu\", 2. \"parpudthadu\", 3. \"pandudthadu\", .\n\nIn the Indian state of Kerala, toddy is used in leavening (as a substitute for yeast) a local form of hopper called the \"Vellayappam\". Toddy is mixed with rice dough and left over night to aid in fermentation and expansion of the dough causing the dough to rise overnight, making the bread soft when prepared.\n\nIn Kerala, toddy is sold under a licence issued by the excise department and it is an industry having more than 50,000 employees with a welfare board under the labour department. It is also used in the preparation of a soft variety of Sanna, which is famous in the parts of Karnataka and Goa in India.\n\n\"Tuak\" is imbibed in Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan and Bali of Indonesia and parts of Malaysia such as Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia. The beverage is a popular drink among the Kadazan-Dusun, Ibans and the Dayaks during the Gawai and Kaamatan festivals, weddings, hosting of guests and other special occasions. The Batak people of North Sumatra also consume palm wine, with the palm sap is mixed with raru bark to make Tuak. The brew is served at stalls along with snacks. The same word is used for other drinks in Indonesia, for example those made using fermented rice.\n\nProduction of palm wine may have contributed to the endangered status of the Chilean wine palm (\"Jubaea chilensis\").\n\nIn Tuvalu, the process of making toddy can clearly be seen with tapped palm trees that line Funafuti International Airport.\nIn Kiribati it is called Karewe and freshly tapped sap from coconut spathe is used as a refreshing drink and the fermented sap is used as an alcoholic beverage. Karewe is boiled to reduce into a thick light brown liquid, called \"kamwaimwai\", used as sweetener and spread.\n\nSome small pollinating mammals consume large amounts of fermented palm nectar as part of their diet, especially the southeast Asian pen-tailed treeshrew. The inflorescences of the bertam palm contain populations of yeast which ferment the nectar in the flowers to up to 3.8% alcohol (average: 0.6%). The treeshrews metabolize the alcohol very efficiently and do not appear to become drunk from the fermented nectar.\n\nThere are a variety of regional names for Palm wine:\n\nThe tapping and consumption of palm wine are recurrent motifs in the Chinua Achebe novel \"Things Fall Apart\", and in the Amos Tutuola novel \"The Palm-Wine Drinkard\".\n\n\nNotes\n"}
{"id": "28292122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28292122", "title": "Production for use", "text": "Production for use\n\nProduction for use is a phrase referring to the principle of economic organization and production taken as a defining criterion for a socialist economy. It is held in contrast to production for profit. This criterion is used to distinguish socialism from capitalism, and was one of the fundamental defining characteristics of socialism initially shared by Marxian socialists, evolutionary socialists, social anarchists and Christian socialists.\n\nThis principle is broad and can refer to an array of different configurations that vary based on the underlying theory of economics employed. In its classic definition, production for use implied an economic system whereby the law of value and law of accumulation no longer directed economic activity, whereby a direct measure of utility and value is used in place of the abstractions of the price system, money, and capital. Alternative conceptions of socialism that don't utilize the profit system such as the Lange model involve the use of a price system and monetary calculation.\n\nThe central critique of the \"profits system\" by socialists is that the accumulation of capital (\"making money\") becomes increasingly detached from the process of producing economic value, leading to waste, inefficiency, and social issues. Essentially it is a distortion of proper accounting based on the assertion of the law of value instead of the \"real\" costs of the factors of production, objectively determined outside of social relations.\n\nProduction for \"use\" refers to an arrangement whereby the production of goods and services is carried out ex \"ante\" (directly) for their utility (also called Use-value). The implication is that the value of economic output would be based on use-value or a direct measure of utility as opposed to exchange-value; because economic activity would be undertaken to directly satisfy economic demands and human needs, the productive apparatus would directly serve individual and social needs. This is contrasted with production for exchange of the produced good or service in order to \"profit\", where production is subjected to the perpetual accumulation of capital, a condition where production is only undertaken if it generates profit, implying an ex \"post\" or indirect means of satisfying economic demand. The profits system is oriented toward generating a profit to be reinvested into the economy (and the constant continuation of this process), the result being that society is structured around the need for a perpetual accumulation of capital. In contrast, \"production for use\" means that the accumulation of capital is not a compulsory driving force in the economy, and by extension, the core process which society and culture revolves around. Production for profit, in contrast, is the dominant mode of production in the modern world system, equivocates \"profitability\" and \"productivity\" and presumes that the former always equates to the latter.\n\nSome thinkers, including the Austrian philosopher and political economist Otto Neurath, have used the phrase socialization to refer to the same concept of \"production for use\". In Neurath's phraseology, \"total socialization\" involves calculation in kind in place of financial calculation and a system of planning in place of market-based allocation of economic goods. Alternative conceptions exist in the form of market socialism.\n\nNorman Thomas, a presidential candidate in the United States for the Socialist Party of America, contrasted socialism with capitalism by stating that socialism is based on production for use and an end to the profit system.\n\nEugene V. Debs popularly used the phrase when running for president of the United States in 1912, stating that capitalism is founded upon production for profit, and in contrast, socialism is postulated upon production for use.\n\nKarl Marx referred to the \"production of use-values\" as a feature of any economic mode of production, but characterized capitalism as a mode of production that subjugated the production of use-value for the self-expansion of capital (i.e., capital accumulation or production for profit). In contrast, socialism was vaguely defined as a system based on the direct production of use-value free of the process of continuous capital accumulation.\n\nFriedrich Hayek defined socialism as \"...the common ownership of the means of production and their 'employment for use, not for profit.'\", associating the rise of the welfare state by social democrats in post-World War II Europe as a rejection of socialism in the technical sense.\n\nProponents of socialism argue that production for profit (i.e., capitalism) does not always satisfy the economic needs of people, especially the working-class, because capital only invests in production when it is profitable. This fails to satisfy demand (the needs) of people who lack basic necessities but have insufficient purchasing power to acquire these needs in a manner that would be profitable for businesses. This results in a number of inefficiencies: unsold items are rarely given away to people who need but can’t afford them, unemployed workers are not utilized to produce such services, and resources are expended on occupations that serve no other purpose than to support the accumulation of profit instead of being utilized to provide useful goods and services. For example, the United States housing bubble resulted in an overproduction of housing units that could not be sold at a profit, despite there being sufficient demand and need for housing units.\n\nProduction for use in some form was the historically dominant modality until the initial primitive accumulation of capital.\n\nProduction for use is not in conflict with market allocation. For example, final output (goods and services for consumption) would still be distributed to consumers through a market. Only in a sufficiently developed stage of socialism whereby the forces of production are advanced enough to allow for superabundances of goods and services can distribution be based on free-access / according to needs.\n\nEconomic planning is not synonymous with \"production for use\". Planning is essential in modern globalised production both within enterprises and within nation states. Planning to maximize profitability (i.e., within industries and private corporations) or to improve the efficiency of capital accumulation in the capitalist macro-economy (i.e., monetary policy, fiscal policy, industrial policy) does not change the fundamental criteria and need to generate a financial profit to be reinvested into the economy, lest it go into a crisis. A more recent critique of production for profit is that it fails spectacularly to address issues such as externalities which the board and management of a for profit enterprise are often under a fiduciary responsibility to ignore if they harm or conflict with the shareholders' profit motives.\n\nSocialists suggest a number of irrational outcomes occur from capitalism and the need to accumulate capital when capitalist economies reach a point in development whereby investment accumulates at a greater rate than growth of profitable investment opportunities. The central critique of the profits system maintained by socialists is that the accumulation of capital (\"making money\") becomes further detached from the process of producing economic value, leading to waste, inefficiency and underlying social issues.\n\nAdvertisement and planned obsolescence are strategies used by businesses to generate demand for the perpetual consumption required for capitalism to sustain itself so that instead of satisfying social and individual needs, capitalism first and foremost serves the artificial need for the perpetual accumulation of capital.\n\nThe creation of industries, projects and services for no other purpose than generating profit, economic growth or maintaining employment. The drive to create such industries arises from the need to absorb the savings in the economy (and thus, to maintain the accumulation of capital). This can take the form of corporatization and commercialization of public services (i.e., transforming them into profit-generating industries to absorb investment), or the creation and expansion of sectors of the economy that don't produce any economic value by themselves (that deal only with exchange-related activities) such as financial services, contributing to the formation of economic bubbles, crises and ultimately recessions.\n\nFor socialists, the solution to these problems entails a reorientation of the economic system from production for profit and the need to accumulate capital to a system where production is adjusted to meet individual and social demands directly.\n\nSocialist and non-socialist critics of the Soviet model of economic planning have criticized the Soviet model of a planned economy on similar grounds to the critique leveled against capitalism: production was often undertaken in order to fulfill plan targets as opposed to being produced for use.\n\nAs an objective criterion for socialism, \"production for use\" can be used to evaluate the socialistic content of the composition of former and existing economic systems. For example, an economic system that is dominated by nationalized firms organized around the production of profit – whether this profit is retained by the firm or paid to the government as a dividend payment – would be a state capitalist economy. In such a system, the organizational structure of the firm remains similar to a private-sector firm; non-financial costs are externalized because profitability is the criterion for production, so that the majority of the economy remains essentially capitalist despite the formal title of \"public ownership\". This has led many socialists to categorize the current Chinese economic system as a capitalist or state-capitalist economy.\n\nThe economy of the Soviet Union was based upon capital accumulation for reinvestment and production for profit; the difference between Western capitalism was that the Soviet Union achieved this through nationalized industry and state-directed investment with the eventual goal of building a socialist society based upon production for use and self-management. Vladimir Lenin described the Soviet economy as \"state-monopoly capitalism\" and did not consider it to be socialism. During the 1965 Liberman Reforms, the Soviet Union re-introduced profitability as a criterion for industrial enterprises. Other views argue the Soviet Union evolved into a non-capitalist and non-socialist system characterized by control and subordination of society by the party apparatus or those who coordinate the economy (bureaucratic collectivism).\n\nThe concept of production for use has been rejected by some socialists, most notably proponents of market socialism, who argue that socially held enterprises can compete with each other and generate profit in a market economy, with or without addressing the issue of distribution of this profit. Neoclassical economists argue that, under conditions of Pareto optimality, the pursuit of profit leads to a satisfaction of economic demands - the provision of use-values - and that market socialism would be able to achieve this outcome while retaining profitability as the operational criteria for socialist enterprises. In particular, some market socialists justify their position by claiming that society as a whole would control the surplus product (the profit generated by publicly owned firms), which could be used to finance public goods or public investment as opposed to accumulating in the hands of capitalists/shareholders.\n\nMany social democrats currently reject this concept altogether, and wish to retain the capitalist economic system by promoting a welfare state and economic interventions in order to make capitalism more \"equitable\" without questioning the legitimacy of the profits system.\n\nMichel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as an emergent alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital.\n\nCommons-based peer production generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code. In both cases, production is carried out directly for use - software is produced solely for their use-value.\n\nMultiple forms of valuation have been proposed to govern production in a socialist economy, to serve as a unit of account and to quantify the usefulness of an object in socialism. These include valuations based on labor-time, the expenditure of energy in production, or disaggregated units of physical quantities.\n\nThe classic formulation of socialism involved replacing the criteria of value from money (exchange-value) to physical utility (use-value), to be quantified in terms of physical quantities (Calculation in kind and Input-Output analysis) or some natural unit of accounting, such as energy accounting.\n\nInput-output model analysis is based upon directly determining the physical quantities of goods and services to be produced and allocating economic inputs accordingly; thus production targets are pre-planned. Soviet economic planning was overwhelmingly focused on material balances - balancing the supply of economic inputs with planned output targets.\n\nOskar Lange formulated a mechanism for the direct allocation of capital goods in a socialist economy that was based on the marginal cost of production. Under a capitalist economy, managers of firms are ordered and legally required to base production around profitability, and in theory, competitive pressure creates a downward pressure on profits and forces private businesses to be responsive to demands of consumers, indirectly approximating production for use. In the Lange Model, the firms would be publicly owned and the managers would be tasked with setting the price of output to its marginal cost, thereby achieving pareto efficiency through direct allocation.\n\nCybernetics, the use of computers to coordinate production in an optimal fashion, has been suggested for socialist economies. Oskar Lange, rejecting his earlier proposals for market socialism, argued that the computer is more efficient than the market process at solving the multitude of simultaneous equations required for allocating economic inputs efficiently (either in terms of physical quantities or monetary prices).\n\nSalvador Allende's socialist-led government developed Project Cybersyn; a system whereby economic decisions and feedback could be relayed in real-time through a network of telex machines fusing the information received/given by state enterprises and government departments. The project was disbanded after the 1973 Chilean coup d'état.\n\nBased on the perspective that the law of value would continue to operate in a socialist economy, it is argued that a market economy purged of parasitical and wasteful elements in the form of private ownership of the means of production and the distortions that arise from the concentration of power and wealth in a class of capitalists would enable the market to operate efficiently without distortions. Simply replacing the antagonistic interests between capitalists and workers in enterprises would alter the orientation of the economy from private profit to meeting the demands of the community, as firms would seek to maximize the benefits to the member-workers - who would, as a whole, comprise society. Cooperative economist Jaroslav Vanek suggests that worker self-management and cooperative ownership of enterprises operating in a free-market would allow for a genuine free-market economy free of the market-distorting, monopolistic tendencies and antagonistic interests that emerge from private ownership over production.\n\n"}

{"id": "1558618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1558618", "title": "Roper v. Simmons", "text": "Roper v. Simmons\n\nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), was a landmark decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that it is unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18. The 5-4 decision overruled \"Stanford v. Kentucky\", in which the court had upheld execution of offenders at or above age 16, and overturned statutes in 25 states.\n\nIn Missouri in 1993, 17-year-old Christopher Simmons, along with two younger friends, Charles Benjamin and John Tessmer, concocted a plan to murder Shirley Crook. The plan was to commit burglary and murder by breaking and entering, tying up a victim. The three met in the middle of the night; however, Tessmer dropped out of the plot. Simmons and Benjamin broke into Mrs. Crook's home, bound her hands and covered her eyes. They drove her to a state park and threw her off a bridge.\n\nOnce the case was brought to trial, the evidence was overwhelming. Simmons had confessed to the murder, performed a videotaped reenactment at the crime scene, and there was testimony from Tessmer against him that showed premeditation. (Simmons discussed the plot in advance and later bragged about the crime). The jury returned a guilty verdict. Even considering mitigating factors (no criminal history and his age), the jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court imposed.\n\nSimmons moved for the trial court to set aside the conviction and sentence, citing, in part, ineffective assistance of counsel. His age, and thus impulsiveness, along with a troubled background, were brought up as issues that Simmons claimed should have been raised at the sentencing phase. The trial court rejected the motion, and Simmons appealed.\n\nThe case worked its way up the court system, with the courts continuing to uphold the death sentence. However, in light of a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, in \"Atkins v. Virginia\", that overturned the death penalty for the intellectually disabled, Simmons filed a new petition for state post-conviction relief. The Supreme Court of Missouri concluded that \"a national consensus has developed against the execution of juvenile offenders\" and held that such punishment now violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. They sentenced Simmons to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nThe State of Missouri appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nThis case was argued on October 13, 2004. The appeal challenged the constitutionality of capital punishment for persons who were juveniles when their crimes were committed, citing the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nA 1988 Supreme Court decision, \"Thompson v. Oklahoma\", barred execution of offenders under the age of 16. In 1989, another case, \"Stanford v. Kentucky,\" upheld the possibility of capital punishment for offenders who were 16 or 17 years old when they committed the capital offense. The same day in 1989, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Penry v. Lynaugh\" that it was permissible to execute the intellectually disabled. However, in 2002, that decision was overruled in \"Atkins v. Virginia,\" where the Court held that evolving standards of decency had made the execution of the mentally retarded \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and thus unconstitutional.\n\nUnder the \"evolving standards of decency\" test, the Court held that it was cruel and unusual punishment to execute a person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the murder. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy cited a body of sociological and scientific research that found that juveniles have a lack of maturity and sense of responsibility compared to adults. Adolescents were found to be over-represented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. The Court noted that in recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every state prohibited those under age 18 from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. The studies also found that juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, to escape a criminogenic setting.\n\nIn support of the \"national consensus\" position, the Court noted that states were reducing the frequency by which they applied capital punishment to juvenile offenders. At the time of the decision, 20 states had the juvenile death penalty on the books, but only six states had executed prisoners since 1989 for crimes committed as juveniles. Only three states had done so since 1994: Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. Furthermore, five of the states that allowed the juvenile death penalty at the time of the 1989 case had since abolished it.\n\nThe Court also looked to practices in other countries to support the holding. Between 1990 and the time of the case, the court said, \"only seven countries other than the United States ha[d] executed juvenile offenders ... : Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and China.\" Justice Kennedy noted that since 1990, each of those countries had either abolished the death penalty for juveniles or made public disavowal of the practice, and that the United States stood alone in allowing execution of juvenile offenders; however, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, and Yemen continued to execute juvenile offenders after 2005, with Iran executing 3 juvenile offenders in January 2018 alone. The Court also noted that only the United States and Somalia had not ratified Article 37 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (September 2, 1990), which expressly prohibits capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles.\n\nJustice Scalia wrote a dissent joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas. Justice O’Connor also wrote a dissenting opinion. The dissents put into question whether a “national consensus” had formed among the state laws, citing the fact that at the time of the ruling, only 18 of the 38 states allowing the death penalty (47%) prohibited the execution of juveniles (the other 12 states executed neither juveniles nor adults).\n\nHowever, the primary objection of the Court's two originalists, Justices Scalia and Thomas, was whether such a consensus was relevant. Justice Scalia argued that the appropriate question was not whether there was presently a consensus against the execution of juveniles, but rather whether the execution of such defendants was considered cruel and unusual at the point at which the Bill of Rights was ratified.\n\nIn addition, Justice Scalia also objected in general to the Court's willingness to take guidance from foreign law in interpreting the Constitution; his dissent questioned not only the relevance of foreign law but also claimed the Court would \"invoke alien law when it agrees with one's own thinking, and ignore it otherwise,\" noting that in the case of abortion, U.S. laws are less restrictive than the international norm.\n\nScalia also attacked the majority opinion as being fundamentally antidemocratic. His dissent cited a passage from \"The Federalist Papers\" in arguing that the role of the judiciary in the constitutional scheme is to interpret the law as formulated in democratically selected legislatures. He argued that the Court exists to rule on what the law \"says\", not what it \"should\" say, and that it is for the \"legislature\", acting in the manner prescribed in Article V of the Constitution to offer amendments to the Constitution in light of the evolving standard of decency, not for the \"Court\" to arbitrarily make \"de facto\" amendments. He challenged the right of unelected lawyers to discern moral values and to impose them on the people in the name of flexible readings of the constitutional text.\n\nIn addition to striking down the death sentence of Christopher Simmons, the Supreme Court's decision in \"Roper v. Simmons\" also canceled the death sentences of 72 others for crimes they committed while younger than age 18. The greatest effects were in Texas, where 29 juvenile offenders were awaiting execution, and in Alabama, where 14 on death row had been sentenced as juveniles. No other state had more than five such offenders on death row.[2]\nPrior to the Roper decision, there had been 22 executions since 1976 of individuals who were juveniles at the time they committed the crime; 13 were in Texas.\n\nThe majority ruling highlighted several controversies in the field of constitutional jurisprudence. The first is the use of the concept of an evolving \"national consensus\" to allow for the re-interpretation of previous rulings. In this case, the evolving consensus was influenced by behavioral and other research studies, such as those presented to the court in an amicus brief by the American Psychological Association. What constitutes evidence for such a consensus—and from where the judicial branch derives its authority to determine it and implement it into law, a function constitutionally vested in the legislative branch, especially in the case of capital punishment—is unclear at this point. In \"Roper v. Simmons\" the majority cited the abolishment of juvenile capital punishment in 30 states (18 of the 38 allowing capital punishment) as evidence of such a consensus. In \"Atkins v. Virginia\", it was the \"consensus\" of the 30 states (18 of 38 allowing capital punishment) that had banned execution of the mildly retarded.\n\nAnother controversy is the role of foreign laws and norms in the interpretation of U.S. law. In 2004 Representative Tom Feeney (FL-R) introduced a non-binding resolution instructing the judiciary to ignore foreign precedent when making their rulings: \"This resolution advises the courts they are no longer engaging in 'good behavior' in the meaning of the Constitution and they may subject themselves to the ultimate remedy, which would be impeachment.\"\n\nThe implications of this ruling were immediately felt in the State of Virginia, where Lee Boyd Malvo became no longer eligible for the death penalty for his role in the Beltway sniper attacks that terrorized the Washington, D.C. area in October 2002. At the time of the attacks, Malvo was 17 years old. Malvo had already been spared the death penalty in his first trial for the murder of FBI employee Linda Franklin in Falls Church, Virginia, and had pleaded guilty in another case in Spotsylvania County; however, he had yet to face trial in Prince William County, Virginia, as well as in Washington, D.C., Washington state, Texas, Maryland, Louisiana, California, Arizona and Alabama. In light of this Supreme Court decision, the prosecutors in Prince William County decided not to pursue the charges against Malvo. At the outset of the Beltway sniper prosecutions, the primary reason for extraditing the two suspects from Maryland, where they were arrested, to Virginia, was the difference in how the two states deal with the death penalty. While the death penalty was allowed in Maryland, it was only applied to persons who were adults at the time of their crimes, whereas Virginia had also allowed the death penalty for offenders who had been juveniles when their crimes were committed.\n\nIn \"Ex parte Adams\", the Supreme Court of Alabama remanded the death sentence of a juvenile for a rehearing in the lower court in light of the Roper decision, which was released while the Adams case was pending appeal. Justice Tom Parker, who had participated in the prosecution of the case, recused himself. He published an op-ed in \"The Birmingham News\" to criticize his non-recused colleagues for their decision. \"State supreme courts may decline to follow bad U.S. Supreme Court precedents because those decisions bind only the parties to the particular case,\" wrote Justice Parker.\n\nThe State sought review in the US Supreme Court, raising a single issue, \"Whether this Court should reconsider its decision in \"Roper v. Simmons\", 543 U.S. 551 (2005).\" The Supreme Court denied certiorari (i.e., declined to take the case for review) on June 19, 2006, without a published dissent.\n\n\n\n"}

Once widespread and commonplace, the survival of some rural crafts is now in doubt according to the report 'Mapping Heritage Craft' (Nov 2012).\n\nNot being generally produced for sale, they do not fall under the description of handicraft. Not being produced as a hobby, they do not qualify as arts and crafts. Not (until very recently) being produced by a dedicated full-time worker, but rather being part of a general repertoire of skills, they have not been produced for sale by an artisan class of makers. The exceptions to the latter would be the wheelwrights, saddle-makers and blacksmiths.\n\nExamples of rural crafts would be:\n\n\nA wide variety of joinery construction in wood was also practiced, from tool-making through gate-making and wheel-making, to full-scale barn building. Some add skills such as beekeeping and path laying to the list of rural crafts. In coastal areas, there are additional crafts associated with the sea; such as net making for fishing, and small boat making.\n\nRural crafts will tend to vary in their styles from place to place, and will thus often contribute strongly to a sense of place.\n\nOffering training courses in, and demonstrations of, rural crafts is now becoming a viable job in some parts of the British Isles, and thus contributing to the development of tourism. Artists such as Andy Goldsworthy are also exploring the artistic possibilities of applying rural crafts techniques to the making of outdoor sculptural art.\n\nThe rural crafts are to be distinguished from the pseudo-primitive \"rustic\" handicraft goods often seen in rural gift shops.\n\n\n"}

Her sentence was commuted and she was freed in 2014 after nine years on death row.\n\nAshtiani is an Iranian Azeri born in Tabriz in the Persian calendar 1347 (1967–1968) and grew up in the rural town of Osku, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. Sakineh worked outside her home for two years as a kindergarten teacher.\n\nAshtiani was arrested in 2005 on charges of adultery and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her husband. In 2006, the court sentenced her to death by stoning after she was convicted. An international campaign to overturn her sentence was started by her children, Farideh and Sajjad Qaderzadeh, through a letter about their mother's case which is published by \"Mission Free Iran\".\n\nProminent media sources picked up on the news via interviews with her son, which include information on her stoning sentence. The international publicity generated by Ashtiani's situation lead to numerous diplomatic conflicts between Iran's government and the heads of certain western governments. As a result, her execution has been stayed indefinitely. Shortly after the international campaign begins, various Iranian officials state that Ashtiani is also guilty of various charges related to the murder of her husband. The range of charges includes murder, manslaughter, conspiracy, and complicity. However, major human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, some NGOs and her lawyers have stated that Ashtiani was acquitted of murder, and that she initially received a 10-year sentence for complicity in murder and \"disrupting the public order\". It was reduced to five years on appeal. She was convicted twice of adultery in separate trials and sentenced to death by stoning.\n\nIn December 2011, the Iranian authorities indicated that they intend to go ahead with her execution, but by hanging. However, the hanging was not carried out, and Iranian officials afterwards denied that they intended to execute her.\n\nOn 24 July 2012, Amnesty International stresses that Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's fate is still unclear, while her former lawyer Javid Houtan Kiyan languishes in jail.\n\nIn March 2014 Ashtiani was pardoned for good behavior and released from prison.\n\nThe civil and criminal law (the Islamic Penal Code) is determined by Iran's Parliament (known as Majlis), and it must conform to and not contradict Sharia law. The law states that unmarried adulterers will receive 100 lashes, and married adulterers will be sentenced to death by stoning. However, it demands heavy proof requirements. To be convicted, the person either must confess to the crime, have four witnesses testify against him/her, or in some rare cases, the judges may use circumstantial evidence. If the person is repentant, the judge can give a reduced sentence of 99 lashes. In addition, the person may also spend one year in prison. Due to the high proof requirements, convictions for adultery are relatively rare, and even when they occur, the death sentence for that crime is almost never given, except in serious cases such as when the spouse died (which is what occurred in Ashtiani's case). In 2002, Iran had put a moratorium on stoning to death. In January 2012, Iran officially changed its law, saying that adultery could be punished by hanging, rather than stoning, possibly ending that punishment in Iran. This penalty has never been carried out for more than a decade in Iran and is unlikely in the near future.\n\nIn 2005, Ebrahim Qaderzadeh, Ashtiani's husband, aged 44, was murdered by electrocution by his cousin, Isa Taheri.\n\nAshtiani allegedly committed adultery with Isa Taheri, who murdered her husband, as well as a second unknown man. Taheri and Ashtiani were arrested as suspects, and according to some sources, Ashtiani was accused of committing adultery by the wife of one of her late husband's coworkers. On May 15, 2006 Sakineh entered a guilty plea of having had an \"illicit relationship outside marriage\" with another man (court records show it was not Taheri, but another person). The court handed down a punishment of 99 lashes; her son watched the whipping. In addition, she may have received one year in prison as well.\n\nIn his trial, Taheri was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Under Islamic law, murderers can be forgiven and pay restitution (\"diyya\") to the victim's family, or the family can demand retribution (\"qisas\") and have the murderer executed. Sajjad Qaderzadeh, Ashtiani's son, forgave Taheri, accepted blood money, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. According to some sources, he has been later freed and is no longer in prison.\n\nIn September 2006, her murder case went to trial. She was not found guilty of the actual murder (since she did not physically kill her husband and the murderer was forgiven) but she was given 10 years in prison for complicity in murder and disrupting the public order, equal to Taheri's sentence. Upon appeal, this was later reduced to five years in prison. She was also brought to trial again for adultery. Her son, Sajjad Qaderzadeh, states that he was unaware of this new trial, and as she had been convicted for adultery previously, this new trial was \"illegal\". However, this trial may have been for adultery committed with Taheri, rather than a \"second man\", as records from her previous trial seem to indicate. This time, the court sentenced her to death, because of her alleged role in her husband's murder. Ashtiani recanted a previous confession and entered a plea of \"not guilty\". Out of the five ruling judges, three found her guilty; the other two indicated that although they do not doubt her guilt, since she has been previously convicted of adultery, she should not be punished again.\n\nDue to the 3-2 majority vote, she was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. Ashtiani may have had difficulty understanding the case because she speaks Azeri and not Persian. Malek Ejdar Sharifi, head of East Azerbaijan Province's judiciary said, \"She was sentenced to capital punishment... for committing murder, manslaughter and adultery.\" However, according to advocacy group Mission Free Iran, this is contrary to the documentation on Ashtiani's case. Iran's Supreme Court confirmed her death sentence in 2007. Her appeal was denied, as was her request for clemency by the \"Amnesty and Pardons Commission\" of Iran.\n\nIn mid-2010, Ashtiani became the subject of an international campaign, which may have prompted renewed developments in her case.\n\nThe Press Section of the Iranian Embassy in London issued the following statement on July 8, 2010:\"Considering the statements made by the Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt on an Iranian national, Mrs Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, and her execution, hereby this mission denies the false news aired in this respect and notifies the Ministry that according to information from the relevant judicial authorities in Iran, she will not be executed by stoning punishment.\"\n\nBy July 9, 2010, the Iranian government banned reporters in Iran from reporting on any details of the case. One of her lawyers, Mohammed Mostafaei, fled the country when he is charged with \"financial fraud\". Mostafaei stated that he was being harassed for defending his client, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, as well as other clients. Mostafaei sought asylum internationally, first in Turkey, and then Norway, where he was reunited with his family on September 2, 2010.\n\nOn August 4, 2010, the Iranian authorities told Ashtiani's new lawyer, Houtan Kian, that she faced death by hanging. On the same day, Tehran's High Court rejected a reopening of the trial and instead considered the Tabriz prosecutor's demand to execute Ashtiani. Her case was subsequently transferred to the deputy prosecutor-general Saeed Mortazavi. Ashtiani's son was told that the file on his father's murder case had been lost. Her son stated, \"they are lying about the charges against my mother. She was acquitted of murdering my father but now the government is building up their own story against her.\" Her son's statement was contradicted by numerous Iranian news accounts describing her as being convicted of both complicity in murder and adultery, although those reports may not be accurate.\n\nOn August 12, 2010, Ashtiani was televised from Tabriz prison on an Iranian state-run television program which showed her confessing in native Azerbaijani language to adultery and involvement with the murder of her husband once again. Her lawyer alleged she has been tortured for two days prior to the interview.\n\nOn August 28, Ashtiani was given 24-hour notice that she was to be hanged at dawn the next day. She wrote her last will and testament just before the call to morning prayer at 4:00 AM local time, when she expected to be led to the gallows at Tabriz Prison. However, the sentence was stayed. It may have been a mock execution.\n\nOn September 8, 2010, Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, confirmed that the government had suspended the stoning sentence, pending a review of her husband's murder case. Mehmanparast added that she was guilty of both adultery and murder and that her case was undeserving of the international attention it has drawn. He said that releasing murderers should not be made into a human rights issue and called on countries criticising Iran to release all their murderers as well. According to the human rights organisation Iran Human Rights, Ashtiani remained in danger of capital punishment by hanging.\n\nIran Human Rights also expressed concerns over Mehmanparast's statement about \"Sakineh's murder charge being investigated for the final verdict\". Commenting on this statement, the spokesperson of Iran Human Rights, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, says: \"The fact that the authorities are mentioning murder charges now could mean that Ashtiani is in danger of being sentenced to death for murder\". But Iranian authorities indicate that Ashtiani is \"held in the prison of Tabriz and in perfect health.\"\n\nHer lawyer, Houtan Kian, was arrested in October 2010. Her son was also arrested in October 2010, after speaking to two German reporters, who had entered the country on tourist visas. He is released on $40,000 bail in December. On January 1, 2011, he is shown on television admitting he did not doubt his mother was guilty... but urges Iranian authorities to let her live. He also says it is unfair that Isa Taheri is free. But Press TV reports that, according to the Human Rights Headquarters of the Iranian Judiciary, the deceased husband's \"next of kin waived their right to retribution\"; as a consequence, Taheri has been handed down a 10-year discretionary jail term.\n\nThere have been some cases of political prisoners confessing on live television under torture or extreme pressure in Iran. It is not clear certain if this was such a case or not.\n\nAshtiani's two children began a campaign to overturn their mother's conviction. In June 2010, they wrote a letter to the world asking for help to save their mother, which was then first published on June 26, 2010, by Mission Free Iran's International Committee against Stoning. The letter brought widespread attention in 2010 as a result of grassroots campaigning through social networking sites that led to the letter's being passed along to mainstream mass media. \n\nDuring July 2010, protests occurred in Rome, London and Washington, D.C., among other cities. Calls to stop her execution came from leading human rights groups Avaaz, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch as well as from several high-profile celebrities. A petition was created in support of her release, and has been signed by several additional prominent activists.\n\nOn July 31, 2010, the president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said he would ask the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to send Mrs. Ashtiani to Brazil, where she would be granted asylum. According to the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, the Brazilian ambassador in Tehran was directly instructed to communicate their asylum proposal to the Iranian government. Iranian officials responded by suggesting that Lula had \"not received enough information about the case\". U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioned Mrs. Ashtiani in a declaration on August 10, 2010, urging Iran to respect the fundamental freedoms of its citizens.\n\nIn late August 2010, the Iranian newspaper \"Kayhan\" called Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the First Lady of France, a \"prostitute\" who \"deserved death\" after she condemned the stoning sentence against Mrs. Ashtiani. Iranian officials condemned this statement and Ahmadinejad condemned \"Kayhan's\" comments toward Mrs. Bruni-Sarkozy's as a \"crime\" and \"against Islam\" .\n\nA resolution by the European Parliament on September 8, 2010, declared that \"a sentence of death by stoning can never be justified.\" The vote passed by a margin of 658–1, the sole vote against having been made in error and later rectified, according to the Associated Press. On September 29, 2010, EveryOne Group, a human rights organisation based in Italy, appealed to the Iranian Authorities for an act of compassion for Mrs. Ashtiani.\nInternational human rights campaign for her release, however, has been criticized for being sexist because a study shows that this campaign totally left her male accomplice to his fate despite the fact that both of them were in the same crime and received the same verdict.\n\nIn March 2014, Mohammad-Javad Larijani, the Islamic regime’s Secretary General for Human Rights, announced that Sakineh Ashtiani had been pardoned, due to good behaviour. She had spent nearly 10 years on death row. Larijani stated that the media attention surrounding her sentence to death by stoning was \"propaganda\" and that the death sentence she had initially received was for the murder of her husband and not the adultery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12824727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12824727", "title": "Sliding window protocol", "text": "Sliding window protocol\n\nA sliding window protocol is a feature of packet-based data transmission protocols. Sliding window protocols are used where reliable in-order delivery of packets is required, such as in the Data Link Layer () as well as in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\n\nConceptually, each portion of the transmission (packets in most data link layers, but bytes in TCP) is assigned a unique consecutive sequence number, and the receiver uses the numbers to place received packets in the correct order, discarding duplicate packets and identifying missing ones. The problem with this is that there is no limit on the size of the sequence number that can be required.\n\nBy placing limits on the number of packets that can be transmitted or received at any given time, a sliding window protocol allows an unlimited number of packets to be communicated using fixed-size sequence numbers.\nThe term \"window\" on the transmitter side represents the logical boundary of the total number of packets yet to be acknowledged by the receiver. The receiver informs the transmitter in each acknowledgment packet the current maximum receiver buffer size (window boundary). The TCP header uses a 16 bit field to report the receive window size to the sender. Therefore, the largest window that can be used is 2 = 64 kilobytes. In slow-start mode, the transmitter starts with low packet count and increases the number of packets in each transmission after receiving acknowledgment packets from receiver. For every ack packet received, the window slides by one packet (logically) to transmit one new packet. When the window threshold is reached, the transmitter sends one packet for one ack packet received. If the window limit is 10 packets then in slow start mode the transmitter may start transmitting one packet followed by two packets (before transmitting two packets, one packet ack has to be received), followed by three packets and so on until 10 packets. But after reaching 10 packets, further transmissions are restricted to one packet transmitted for one ack packet received. In a simulation this appears as if the window is moving by one packet distance for every ack packet received. On the receiver side also the window moves one packet for every packet received. \nThe sliding window method ensures that traffic congestion on the network is avoided. The application layer will still be offering data for transmission to TCP without worrying about the network traffic congestion issues as the TCP on sender and receiver side implement sliding windows of packet buffer. The window size may vary dynamically depending on network traffic.\n\nFor the highest possible throughput, it is important that the transmitter is not forced to stop sending by the sliding window protocol earlier than one round-trip delay time (RTT). The limit on the amount of data that it can send before stopping to wait for an acknowledgment should be larger than the bandwidth-delay product of the communications link. If it is not, the protocol will limit the effective bandwidth of the link.\n\nIn any communication protocol based on automatic repeat request for error control, the receiver must acknowledge received packets. If the transmitter does not receive an acknowledgment within a reasonable time, it re-sends the data.\n\nA transmitter that does not hear an acknowledgment cannot know if the receiver actually received the packet; it may be that it was lost or damaged in transmission. If error detection reveals corruption, the packet will be ignored by the receiver and a negative or duplicate acknowledgement will be sent by the receiver. The receiver may also be configured to not send any acknowledgement at all. Similarly, the receiver is usually uncertain about whether its acknowledgements are being received. It may be that an acknowledgment was sent, but was lost or corrupted in the transmission medium. In this case, the receiver must acknowledge the retransmission to prevent the data being continually resent, but must otherwise ignore it.\n\nThe transmitter and receiver each have a current sequence number \"n\" and \"n\", respectively. They each also have a window size \"w\" and \"w\". The window sizes may vary, but in simpler implementations they are fixed. The window size must be greater than zero for any progress to be made.\n\nAs typically implemented, \"n\" is the next packet to be transmitted, i.e. the sequence number of the first packet not yet transmitted. Likewise, \"n\" is the first packet not yet received. Both numbers are monotonically increasing with time; they only ever increase.\n\nThe receiver may also keep track of the highest sequence number yet received; the variable \"n\" is one more than the sequence number of the highest sequence number received. For simple receivers that only accept packets in order (\"w\" = 1), this is the same as \"n\", but can be greater if \"w\" > 1. Note the distinction: all packets below \"n\" have been received, no packets above \"n\" have been received, and between \"n\" and \"n\", some packets have been received.\n\nWhen the receiver receives a packet, it updates its variables appropriately and transmits an acknowledgment with the new \"n\". The transmitter keeps track of the highest acknowledgment it has received \"n\". The transmitter knows that all packets up to, but not including \"n\" have been received, but is uncertain about packets between \"n\" and \"n\"; i.e. \"n\" ≤ \"n\" ≤ \"n\".\n\nThe sequence numbers always obey the rule that \"n\" ≤ \"n\" ≤ \"n\" ≤ \"n\" ≤ \"n\" + \"w\". That is:\n\nWhenever the transmitter has data to send, it may transmit up to \"w\" packets ahead of the latest acknowledgment \"n\". That is, it may transmit packet number \"n\" as long as \"n\" < \"n\"+\"w\".\n\nIn the absence of a communication error, the transmitter soon receives an acknowledgment for all the packets it has sent, leaving \"n\" equal to \"n\". If this does not happen after a reasonable delay, the transmitter must retransmit the packets between \"n\" and \"n\".\n\nTechniques for defining \"reasonable delay\" can be extremely elaborate, but they only affect efficiency; the basic reliability of the sliding window protocol does not depend on the details.\n\nEvery time a packet numbered \"x\" is received, the receiver checks to see if it falls in the receive window, \"n\" ≤ \"x\" < \"n\"+\"w\". (The simplest receivers only have to keep track of one value \"n\"=\"n\".) If it falls within the window, the receiver accepts it. If it is numbered \"n\", the receive sequence number is increased by 1, and possibly more if further consecutive packets were previously received and stored. If \"x\" > \"n\", the packet is stored until all preceding packets have been received. If \"x\"≥\"n\", the latter is updated to \"n\"=\"x\"+1.\n\nIf the packet's number is not within the receive window, the receiver discards it and does not modify \"n\" or \"n\".\n\nWhether the packet was accepted or not, the receiver transmits an acknowledgment containing the current \"n\". (The acknowledgment may also include information about additional packets received between \"n\" or \"n\", but that only helps efficiency.)\n\nNote that there is no point having the receive window \"w\" larger than the transmit window \"w\", because there is no need to worry about receiving a packet that will never be transmitted; the useful range is 1 ≤ \"w\" ≤ \"w\".\n\nSo far, the protocol has been described as if sequence numbers are of unlimited size, ever-increasing. However, rather than transmitting the full sequence number \"x\" in messages, it is possible to transmit only \"x\" mod \"N\", for some finite \"N\". (\"N\" is usually a power of 2.)\n\nFor example, the transmitter will only receive acknowledgments in the range \"n\" to \"n\", inclusive. Since it guarantees that \"n\"−\"n\" ≤ \"w\", there are at most \"w\"+1 possible sequence numbers that could arrive at any given time. Thus, the transmitter can unambiguously decode the sequence number as long as \"N\" > \"w\".\n\nA stronger constraint is imposed by the receiver. The operation of the protocol depends on the receiver being able to reliably distinguish new packets (which should be accepted and processed) from retransmissions of old packets (which should be discarded, and the last acknowledgment retransmitted). This can be done given knowledge of the transmitter's window size. After receiving a packet numbered \"x\", the receiver knows that \"x\" < \"n\"+\"w\", so \"n\" > \"x\"−\"w\". Thus, packets numbered \"x\"−\"w\" will never again be retransmitted.\n\nThe lowest sequence number we will ever receive in future is \"n\"−\"w\"\n\nThe receiver also knows that the transmitter's \"n\" cannot be higher than the highest acknowledgment ever sent, which is \"n\". So the highest sequence number we could possibly see is \"n\"+\"w\" ≤ \"n\"+\"w\".\n\nThus, there are 2\"w\" different sequence numbers that the receiver can receive at any one time. It might therefore seem that we must have \"N\" ≥ 2\"w\". However, the actual limit is lower.\n\nThe additional insight is that the receiver does not need to distinguish between sequence numbers that are too low (less than \"n\") or that are too high (greater than or equal to \"n\"+\"w\"). In either case, the receiver ignores the packet except to retransmit an acknowledgment. Thus, it is only necessary that \"N\" ≥ \"w\"+\"w\". As it is common to have \"w\"<\"w\" (e.g. see Go-Back-N below), this can permit larger \"w\" within a fixed \"N\".\n\nAlthough commonly distinguished from the sliding-window protocol, the stop-and-wait ARQ protocol is actually the simplest possible implementation of it. The transmit window is 1 packet, and the receive window is 1 packet. Thus, \"N\"=1+1=2 possible sequence numbers (conveniently represented by a single bit) are required.\n\nThe transmitter alternately sends packets marked \"odd\" and \"even\". The acknowledgments likewise say \"odd\" and \"even\". Suppose that the transmitter, having sent an odd packet, did not wait for an odd acknowledgment, and instead immediately sent the following even packet. It might then receive an acknowledgment saying \"expecting an odd packet next\". This would leave the transmitter in a quandary: has the receiver received both of the packets, or neither?\n\nGo-Back-N ARQ is the sliding window protocol with \"w\">1, but a fixed \"w\"=1. The receiver refuses to accept any packet but the next one in sequence. If a packet is lost in transit, following packets are ignored until the missing packet is retransmitted, a minimum loss of one round trip time. For this reason, it is inefficient on links that suffer frequent packet loss.\n\nSuppose that we are using a 3-bit sequence number, such as is typical for HDLC. This gives \"N\"=2³=8. Since \"w\"=1, we must limit \"w\"≤7. This is because, after transmitting 7 packets, there are 8 possible results: Anywhere from 0 to 7 packets could have been received successfully. This is 8 possibilities, and the transmitter needs enough information in the acknowledgment to distinguish them all.\n\nIf the transmitter sent 8 packets without waiting for acknowledgment, it could find itself in a quandary similar to the stop-and-wait case: does the acknowledgment mean that all 8 packets were received successfully, or none of them?\n\nThe most general case of the sliding window protocol is Selective Repeat ARQ. This requires a much more capable receiver, which can accept packets with sequence numbers higher than the current \"n\" and store them until the gap is filled in.\n\nThe advantage, however, is that it is not necessary to discard following correct data for one round-trip time before the transmitter can be informed that a retransmission is required. This is therefore preferred for links with low reliability and/or a high bandwidth-delay product.\n\nThe window size \"w\" need only be larger than the number of \"consecutive\" lost packets that can be tolerated. Thus, small values are popular; \"w\"=2 is common.\n\nThe extremely popular HDLC protocol uses a 3-bit sequence number, and has optional provision for selective repeat. However, if selective repeat is to be used, the requirement that \"n\"+\"n\" ≤ 8 must be maintained; if \"w\" is increased to 2, \"w\" must be decreased to 6.\n\nSuppose that \"w\" =2, but an unmodified transmitter is used with \"w\" =7, as is typically used with the go-back-N variant of HDLC. Further suppose that the receiver begins with \"n\" =\"n\" =0.\n\nNow suppose that the receiver sees the following series of packets (all modulo 8):\nBecause \"w\" =2, the receiver will accept and store the final packet 0 (thinking it is packet 8 in the series), while requesting a retransmission of packet 7. However, it is also possible that the transmitter failed to receive any acknowledgments and has retransmitted packet 0. In this latter case, the receiver would accept the wrong packet as packet 8.\nThe solution is for the transmitter to limit \"w\" ≤6. With this restriction, the receiver knows, after receiving packet 6, that the transmitter's \"n\" ≥1, and thus the following packet numbered 0 must be packet 8. If all acknowledgements were lost, then the transmitter would have to stop after packet 5.\n\nThere are many ways that the protocol can be extended:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2117675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2117675", "title": "The First Sex", "text": "The First Sex\n\nThe First Sex is a 1971 book by the American librarian Elizabeth Gould Davis, considered part of the second wave of feminism. In the book, Gould Davis aimed to show that early human society consisted of matriarchal \"queendoms\" based around worship of the \"Great Goddess\", and characterised by pacifism and democracy. Gould Davis argued that the early matriarchal societies attained a high level of civilization, which was largely wiped out as a result of the \"patriarchal revolution\". She asserted that patriarchy introduced a new system of society, based on property rights rather than human rights, and worshipping a stern and vengeful male deity instead of the caring and nurturing Mother Goddess.\n\nThese views of Gould Davis on a Great Goddess predominating in Neolithic Europe and the Near East are similar to those made by a number of writers in the early and mid 20th-century, including Eric Neumann, Thorstein Veblen, Merlin Stone, Robert Graves, Marija Gimbutas, J. J. Bachofen, Walter Burket, James Mellart, Robert Briffault.\n\nAlthough many of her views are considered unsupported by most anthropologists and archaeologists today, a number of writers have continued to develop the themes that Gould Davis originated.\n\nIn the first part of \"The First Sex\", Gould Davis used evidence from archaeology and anthropology to support a theory of matriarchal prehistory. The chapters in this section of the book focus on individual parts of the evidence for peaceful matriarchal queendoms: three are titled \"Mythology Speaks\", \"Anthropology Speaks\" and \"Archaeology Speaks\". Gould Davis said that the \"loss of paradise\" when the \"Great Goddess\" was replaced by a vengeful male deity is the theme of all surviving myth. She argued that evidence from the Neolithic site at Çatal Hüyük showed there to be no wars or even violent death, and that even physical injury to animals may not have been permissible there. She pointed to other parts of the Mediterranean in which female tombs are preserved more carefully than male ones, and took this to be evidence of female primacy. In \"Anthropology Speaks\", Gould Davis focused on taboos, chiefly incest, and aimed to show how taboos against brother-sister relationships acted to protect women against violent men. She also argued that menstrual blood was originally sacred rather than polluting or \"unclean\", and that only when people began to eat meat did men become bigger than women, because of selection of weak women by men.\n\nIn this section of the book, Gould Davis examined how mythology and society changed as a result of a suggested violent conversion from matriarchy to patriarchy. Her theory proposed that patriarchal revolution resulted from the violent invasion of nomadic tribes who were warlike and destructive, overrunning the peaceful, egalitarian matriarchies. These nomads (Semites from the Arabian Peninsula) are argued to have never achieved a civilization of their own, but only to have destroyed or taken over older ones. Gould Davis asserted that many tales in the Old Testament were actually rewritings of older stories, with goddesses changed to male actors, or a goddess raped or overthrown and her powers usurped by the new father deity. This, she suggested, was part of a concerted effort to wipe out all evidence of female authority. Because the violent invaders wished to establish the a patrilineal system of inheritance, rigorous control of women's sexuality became paramount. Thus women's right to sexual pleasure was redefined as sinful, and virginity was conceived of as a property right of a woman's father or husband. Gould Davis discussed female circumcision as a means to protect the virginity of women and assure clear lines of paternity. This practice is described in the book in graphic detail, as performed with unsterilized instruments, without anaesthesia (conditions pertaining to all surgical practices before the nineteenth century).\n\nIn this part of the book, Gould Davis focused on the role of women in the ancient civilizations of Crete and Mycenae. Her research suggested to her that, as in her model of prehistoric civilization, women were the primary powers. The book saw the Cretan and Mycenaean civilizations as remnants of the ancient pre-Christian Celtic culture, which Gould Davis also believed to have granted women a great deal of power. She claimed, for example, that the monarchy was matrilineal, and that most of the tribal chiefs were women rather than men.\n\nGould Davis claimed that Greek women possessed rights that are presently denied by the Catholic, Orthodox, and conservative Protestant churches, such as the rights to abortion and divorce. She cited many well-known historians to support these claims. She also argued that women participated in almost all aspects of ancient Greek and Roman society, including government, learning and sport. In the following chapter, \"The Celts\", she argued that similar rights prevailed until the collapse of the Roman Empire, for a matrilineal system of monarchical descent, and for Celtic women being the major preservers of learning during the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe final part of \"The First Sex\" focused on the period since Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire in 313 A.D. Gould Davis aimed with this part of the book to show how Semitic myths of male supremacy were preached by the early Church Fathers to a Pagan people who would not believe them and did not take them seriously until Constantine became emperor. Gould Davis believed that the writings of Paul in the New Testament were used by the Church to justify violence against women, leading throughout the Middle Ages to a level of cruelty and barbarity unheard of in previous ages. Gould Davis believed that once Christianity had attained civil power, the demotion of women and the \"terrible materialism that marks and mars our present civilization\" were inevitable. She argued that the influence of Mary as a \"Goddess\" grew as the violent imposition of Christianity erased the ancient Goddess religion. Quoting Jules Michelet, Gould Davis argued that women by the fifteenth century were treated so badly by men of all social classes that they were seen as \"worse than beasts\". The Church, she said, approved of this domestic violence, and brutality to women extended beyond families to the priesthood, who cited the Bible to justify themselves.\n\nIn Gould Davis's view, the status of women was only improved briefly by the Reformation and a flowering of learned women during the sixteenth century. Afterward, Puritanism's witch-hunts and a strengthened papacy placed women back in the same level of submission, and women were tortured and studied in the most prurient manner for \"witch marks\". Millions of people, she said, most of whom were women, died by burning, drowning, hanging, or from torture during the Catholic and Protestant Inquisitions. In Gould Davis's view, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries marked the first time Western women accepted their own inferiority, and before Mary Wollstonecraft nobody spoke up for them. Gould Davis made a special effort to show how the \"minds\" of women were subjugated during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.\n\nIn the last part of \"The First Sex\", Gould Davis attempted to show the beliefs used to subordinate women to be myths, contending that in reality women are \"stronger\", and physically, mentally, and morally more than equal to men; and that the survival of humanity depends on the restoration of women to their former position as rulers of society. Gould Davis argued that patriarchal civilization is destroying itself, and that only the values of the \"matriarchates\" can save humanity, because a society based on the mechanistic, Cartesian duality of dominant and violent males leads inevitably to a focus on technology and gadgetry rather than on loving human relationships.\n\nGould Davis called for \"the matriarchal counterrevolution that is the only hope for the survival of the human race\" and opined that \"spiritual force\", \"[m]ental and spiritual gifts\", and \"[e]xtrasensory perception\" will be more important than \"physical force\", \"gifts of a physical nature\", and \"sensory perception\", respectively, so that \"woman will again predominate\" and that \"the next civilization will ... revolve [\"about\"] [\"divine woman\"]\", as it had in the past that she asserted.\n\nAccording to critic Prof. Ginette Castro, Gould Davis proposed a discourse \"rooted in the purest female chauvinism\" and seemed to support \"a feminist counterattack stigmatizing the patriarchal present\", \"giv[ing] ... in to a revenge-seeking form of feminism\", \"build[ing] ... her case on the humiliation of men\", and \"asserti[ng] ... a specifically feminine nature ... [as] morally superior.\" Castro criticized the essentialism and the assertion of superiority as \"sexist\" and \"treason\".\n\nSince its publication, there has been criticism of \"The First Sex\". In \"Goddess Unmasked\", Phillip Davis argued that the assertions by Gould Davis and Marija Gimbutas are severely distorted at best, that serious study of artifacts in Europe and Anatolia does not support the idea of a peaceful matriarchy, and that there is no evidence for a female monotheism of the type advocated by Gould Davis. Similarly, in her 2000 book \"The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory\", Cynthia Eller attempted to show that, not only is Gould Davis's theory of prehistoric matriarchal queendoms unsupported by archaeological evidence, but even if it were true, it would not give women any more hope for a just and equal future, simply because replicating the ancient past in today's world is not feasible. She did, however, accept the notion that some Neolithic and Bronze-Age societies centered around female deities: “Certainly we are aware of numerous cross-cultural instances of goddess worship accompanied by widespread use of … [female] figurines, so this is one of the most likely explanations of the Neolithic figurine assemblages.” Continuing, she wrote, “Especially persuasive is the fact that goddess figurines — and larger-scale goddess images as well — exist in later cultures in the same geographic area” as the prehistoric figurines (p. 139).\n\nIn a partially sympathetic review, Ginette Castro wrote, \"For this obscure librarian from Florida, myth is historically true\" . . . \"Elizabeth Gould Davis's historical reconstruction depends a great deal on drawing morals from the tale, and is filled with numerous, glaring extrapolations. However, the argument is so skillfully and ingeniously woven that the woman reader cannot help but be swayed.\" \"Although it is difficult to grant the book any immediate practical value, it must be recognized that it has a cultural interest, that of exposing the sexual substrata of our culture.\"\n\nOther writers with a feminist orientation have, however, reviewed the book more harshly. Kay L. Cothran, in the \"Journal of American Folklore\", wrote, \"the book is an example of folklore misapplied\" . . . \"The problem of evidence runs throughout the book, which is heavily footnoted and jammed with quotations. The difference between citations and evidence has not impressed itself upon [Gould] Davis. Her notes come from a librarian's search, not a scholar's research. For [Gould] Davis, a reliable source is one that agrees with her; one that disagrees is a part of the conspiracy.\" \"So the kindest thing one can say for [Gould] Davis' folkloristic and general scholarly competence is that it does not exist. It is unfortunate that she buries some sound information under such piles of rubbish.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, Amy Hackett and Sarah Pomeroy, in \"Feminist Studies\", wrote, \"Unfortunately, \"The First Sex\" is a bad book, as we shall demonstrate. Yet it deserves more than a perfunctory dismissal.\" \"The book's extravagant disorganization makes the job of summarizing nearly impossible.\" \"It typifies [Gould] Davis's method that her 'historical' chapters reflect an inverse relationship between what available sources, documents, statistics, and the like allow us to know about women in a given period and the space she devotes to that period. Some excellent sources do exist for women's history, but [Gould] Davis prefers to rely on the obscure, idiosyncratic, and piquant, ignoring more substantive sources.\" . . . \"until historians reject old-fashioned science and opt for intuition, [Gould] Davis's brand of history will be unacceptable.\"\n\nAccording to Castro, the book \"undeniably\" encouraged women to study their history.\n\n"}

Another revised edition was published in 2008.\n\nGrimes was born into slavery in King George County, Virginia, in 1784. His father was Benjamin Grymes, a wealthy plantation owner; Grimes' mother was a slave on a neighboring plantation. During his years of slavery, Grimes was owned by at least ten different masters, in the States of Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia. He worked as a house servant, valet, field worker, stable boy, and coachman. In 1814, at the age of 30, Grimes escaped from slavery by stowing away on a ship that sailed from Savannah, Georgia to New York City.\n\nGrimes settled in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was a successful barber. His clients included students from nearby Yale College and Litchfield. Grimes' former master tracked him down and demanded that Grimes purchase his freedom with \"my house and land, all I had,\" or else face arrest and re-enslavement. Grimes had no choice but to pay, and wrote his memoir in hopes of recovering his finances.\n\nGrimes died on August 20, 1865, about 81 years old, in New Haven, Connecticut.

{"id": "27704632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27704632", "title": "Women in Yemen", "text": "Women in Yemen\n\nWomen in Yemen have historically been placed at a disadvantage due to their sex, with a highly patriarchal society.\n\nAlthough the government of Yemen has made efforts that will improve the rights of women in Yemen (including the formation of a Women's Development Strategy and a Women Health Development Strategy), many cultural and religious norms, along with poor enforcement of this legislation from the Yemeni government, have prevented Yemeni women from having equal rights to men.\n\nIn 2017, Yemeni women do not hold many economic, social or cultural rights. While suffrage was gained in 1967 and constitutional and legal protection was extended to women during the first years of Yemen unity between 1990–1994, they continue to struggle “in exercising their full political and civil rights”. History shows that women have played major roles in Yemeni society. Some women of pre-Islamic and early Islamic Yemen held elite status in society. The Queen of Sheba, for example, “is a source of pride for the Yemeni nation”. In addition, Queen Arwa has been noted for her attention to infrastructure, which added to a documented time of prosperity under her rule. Modern day women of Yemen, however, are subject to a society that reflects largely agrarian, tribal, and patriarchal traditions. This, combined with illiteracy and economic issues has led women to continuously be deprived of their rights as citizens of Yemen.\n\nDue to the ongoing armed conflict in Yemen since the end of March 2015, Yemen is undergoing a humanitarian crisis worldwide. The conflict has brought numerous accusations of violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law. The events have been brutal, and have had cruel consequences on all civilians, but especially on the lives of women and young girls. Due to the tension and chaos of the crisis, combined with the deep-rooted gender inequality, conditions for women and girls in Yemen are deteriorating as the conflict drags on. Women and girls have been left vulnerable to inhumane violence, physical and psychological abuse and exploitation.\n\n While Article 40 and 41 of the 1990 unification constitution of Yemen stipulates that all citizens are considered equal before the law and that \"“Every citizen has the right to participate in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the country”\" gender discrimination is prevalent in Yemen.\n\nThe addition of Article 31 to the constitution, contradicts article 40 by stating that \"Women are the sisters of men...they have rights and duties, which are guaranteed and assigned by Shari'a and stipulated by law\" has seemingly nullified the equality extended by the constitution due to its use as a base for discriminatory laws. This is due to the specific reading of Shari'a, which restricts the rights of women. Today, many Yemeni activist women believe that Shari'a can be interpreted to further include women in the social, political, economic, and cultural life of the country.\n\nMany of the discriminatory policies restrict familial rights of women. Women in Yemen cannot marry a non-Yemeni without approval from both her family and the state. Further, under the Nationality Law of 1990, Yemeni women cannot pass their citizenship onto their children unless the woman divorces her husband, her husband is found to be insane or her husband dies, in which case the children can gain citizenship when they turn 19. The children of Yemeni men married to foreigners, on the other hand, are ensure Yemeni citizenship. Further, divorce and even testimony of women is not equal to that of Yemeni men. Yemeni men have the right to divorce their wives at any time without justification, a woman on the other hand must go through a process of litigation in which they justify their reason for nullifying the marriage contract. Before the court, a woman is considered only half a person, that is it takes “the testimony of two women” to equal “the testimony of one man.” Additionally, women are prohibited from testifying in cases of adultery, slander, theft or sodomy by Article 45 (21) of the 1992 Evidence Law.\n\nOther laws that discriminate against women are: Personal Status Law (1992) and Penal Code Law (1994). The Personal Status Law contravenes parts of the Convention on Eliminating All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), by stating that women are required to provide sexual access to her husband, basically permitting rape within a marriage. Likewise, provisions in the Penal Code increase the vulnerability of women to violence. Article 232 of the Penal Code allows for reduced and lenient sentences of men convicted of so-called \"honour killing\". Under Yemeni law murder is punishable by death, however the Penal Code imposes a maximum prison sentence of only one year in cases of \"honour killings\".\n\nThere are a number of forms of violence that women in Yemen are exposed to, and these include: physical and psychological abuse from family members, forced marriage, sexual harassment, forced pregnancy, rape, polygamy, health services deprivation and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C).Forced marriage and FGM/C are considered part of culture and tradition, and therefore they are not viewed as a form of violence in Yemen. In fact, 94% of FGM/C is not done by certified medical doctors, due to ministerial decree issued by the Minister of Health that bans FGM/C in the official centers therefore, as a result, FMG/C has been conducted in the homes. FMG/C is done as a result of cultural practices, lack of knowledge of the risk connected with this harmful procedure, and law of prohibiting this behaviour.\n\nWithin Yemeni society, there is a strong preference for male children, as well as a high tolerance of violent behaviour towards females. Thus, female children are often disciplined and punished, if they challenge this behaviour, and attempt to defend themselves. These practices do not only take place inside the homes, but also in schools, social institutes and workplaces. National and local media in fact, often encourage and reinforce the tendency for such discriminating acts and behaviour.\n\nThe most vulnerable group of women exposed to violence in Yemen, is marginalized, poor and rural women. While conditions of poverty tend to intensify forms of incidences of violence against women, rural women are also forced to carry out most agricultural work and physical labour.\n\nWomen in Yemen are also subjected to violence through the institutionalization of discriminatory laws. Article 42 of the Crimes and Punishment Law No 12 (1994) amounts a woman's blood money (diya) as half of a man's, effectively devaluing the female's life to half as much as a man's. In the incident of unintended killing, law identifies a compensation for killing a male, of one million Yemeni Rial (YR), which is around 5,000USD. However, female victims’ families are compensated half that amount with only 500,000YR, which is 2,500USD.\n\nAmendments to other laws in the late 1990s, further lowered the status of Yemeni women. For example, in the 1992 version of the Personal Status Law, the minimum age for marriage was 15, however, in the 1998 amendment, the wording was replaced with general terms, which ultimately amounted to the legalisation of marriage contracts for minors. Under Article No. 15 of the current Personal Status law, it is stated that marriage to a \"little girl\" is valid, unless she is not ready for sex. What the article is conveying, is that girls under 15, may be forced to marry, if they are ready to engage in sexual relations. On that, the law disregards the fact that, despite the physical and psychological capability to engage in sexual relations, decision to do so should be a personal one, and should depend on the wishes of each individual woman. Personal Status Law also enables marital rape and domestic violence. For example, Article 40 as revised in 1998, provides that a woman must be obedient to her husband. In doing so, Article 40 does not allow a woman to leave her home without her husband's permission. The husband is also allowed to have sexual relations with his wife, whenever he pleases, and she should allow that in return.\n\nThe international community has recognized that violence against women is a violation of women's human rights, their bodily integrity, and their sexual and reproductive rights. It is also acknowledged that promotion of women's rights is a means to ensure sustainable development. The Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) 1979 imposes legally binding duties to eliminate discrimination against women and ensure equality between women and men.\n\nAllegations of violence and sexual abuse in Yemen have been reported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In July 2015, OHCHR visited Thawra hospital in Sana'a City and met with witnesses who confirmed cases in which internally displaced persons had been victims of rape. In February 2016, an OHCHR monitor visited the women's central prison in Sana'a City, where four victims reported that they had been blindfolded during their capture and subjected to electric shocks.\n\nWomen in Yemen have always had limited participation in society, as men are considered the primary decision makers both inside and outside the household. Thus, women have always been grossly underrepresented in Yemeni politics. This has not, however, prevented women from trying to make their voices heard through strikes and peaceful protests. Some progress has been made since 2011, as the 2011 Uprising challenged the norm of women's limited participation. Women were at the heart of protests, demanding and protesting for a better political life. Then in 2014, women represented more than one quarter of the participants in the National Dialogue Conference (NDC). Through that, women of Yemen achieved important agreements, including the 30% quota for women's political participation. During the NDC, many women delegates were publicly threatened for participating and were even physically attacked on the streets. To support the women and their movements, several women's human rights organisations, such as the Sisters Arab Forum for Human Rights, increased their efforts and encouraged women to continue participating and fighting for the issues they were passionate about. The international community applauded the positive outcomes of the NDC process as this was a very significant change for women's participation in the Yemeni politics, in comparison to the previous years. In fact, in 2008 an attempt was made to introduce 15% quota for women in parliament, however this process was abandoned, after Islamic clerics and tribal chiefs intervened and held a ‘Meeting for Protecting Virtue and Fighting Vice,’ proclaiming that a woman's place is at home. In the former national parliament, women held only 0.3% of the seats.\n\nDespite the achievements made in 2014 by the NDC, women's political participation has been suspended as a result of the current ongoing conflict.\n\nYemen is a society with the cultural attitude, that women have a low status in the family, as well as in the community. A man is allowed to marry up to four wives as long as he has the financial means, however a woman is not even entitled to enter marriage under her own free will, as she needs the approval and agreement of a male guardian. In case of divorce, children can be removed from the mother's care, while the father does not face such risks of losing his children. A woman is also not allowed to deny visitation rights for the father, while the father is allowed to do so under Article 145 of the Personal Status Act. Health and reproductive rights are also major issues for Yemeni women. No legislation protects their freedom to make their own decisions with regards to these issues and thus women are controlled by their family or, if married, by their husbands. Further, Yemen is a country where female genital mutilation (FGM) remains an issue, even after being banned by the Ministry of Public Health. In addition, many women are forced to marry at a young age, made possible by state policies, which gives the family the control over whether or not a girl marries and when. Child marriage is a problem with a report of 52% of Yemeni girls getting married before the age of 18, including 14% before the age of 15. With the recent conflict, this trend has reportedly increased. Many families have used it as a coping mechanism during the ongoing crisis, and as a way of accessing dowry payments. The common practice of forcing young girls to marry was condemned by an NGO as \"child rape condoned under the guise of marriage.\" Yemen has a tribal culture, and the marriage of young girls is common; most Yemeni girls are married before they reach puberty. A proposed law setting a minimum age for marriage of 17 for women was opposed by conservative Yemenis, including women.\n\nMen and women, do not have the same rights for education in Yemen. The country is still a long way from achieving gender equality, despite Article 54 of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, which states that \"Education is a right for all citizens. The state shall guarantee education in accordance with the law through building various schools and cultural and educational institutions. Basic education is obligatory. The state shall do its best to obliterate illiteracy and give special care to expanding technical and vocational education. The state shall give special attention to young people and protect them against perversions, provide them with religious, mental and physical education, and the appropriate environment to develop their aptitude in all fields.\" According to a survey done by UNICEF in 2013, girls are 50% less likely to enroll in school compared to boys, and they are also less likely to complete basic secondary and post-secondary education. Other studies have found that girls are usually more likely to drop out of school, than boys. For example, a study done in 2014 by Yemeni Ministry of Education, found that girls are 17% more likely to drop out of school at the primary school level, while 23% more likely than boys to drop out of school by the lower secondary level. Human Rights Watch has documented that forced child marriage is a leading factor as to why girls drop out of school. In the Demographic and Health Survey of 2013, it was discovered that only 6% of women had continued their education post-secondary school, while a survey done by UNICEF found that 71% of schools do not have female teachers. Due to the high percentage drop-out, women have lower literacy rate than men. According to the 2013 Global Gender Gap, only 49% of women in Yemen are literate, in contrast to 82% of men being literate.\n\nIn the World Economic Forum's 2014 Gender Gap Report, out of the 142 countries included in the report, Yemen ranked last, and has continued to do so since 2007. While women have the legal rights to ownership and use of property, many women in Yemen give administrative rights to male members of their family because they are not aware of their rights. This has been attributed to “widespread illiteracy, patriarchal attitudes, and women’s ignorance of their economic rights”. In 2003, it was estimated that only 30% of the Yemeni female population was literate.\nAs Elhum Haghight-Sordellini points out, growth of the economy “can create a powerful need to bring women into the labor force”, however, Yemen's “lack of economic growth and dependency on more developed nations” and more general instability can “prevent social change”. Economic issues are made worse in Yemen by “jobless growth in the face of a rising population”. Today, 41.8% of Yemen's population lives below the National Poverty line, many of them women. (undmg Yemen). This may be attributed to the large education gap between men and women in Yemen, as well as prevalent and illegal discrimination in the workforce against women. Freedom House reported that while 73% of boys were enrolled in primary school in rural areas, only 30% of girls enrolled. Though the 1995 Labor Law prohibits workplace discrimination based on gender, it is not enforced in practice, therefore greatly limiting opportunities for women.\n\nWhile Yemeni women are not prohibited to work, there are other barriers that make it difficult for them to seek employment. Firstly,as mentioned above, women lack in education. Secondly, the Personal Status Law does not allow a woman to leave the house, unless with permission from her husband,and thirdly, culturally, Yemeni women are expected to stay home and take care of the children, so that denies them access to employment opportunities. For these reasons and more,in 2013 the World Economic Forum reported that the female unemployment was 41%,compared to the men's which was only 12%.\n\nYemeni women's rights activist Tawakul Karman, founder and chair of Women Journalists Without Chains (WJWC), was one of three recipients of the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize. As one Al Jazeera article points out, the awards serve as “an accolade for the entire Arab Spring” as well as a recognition of “women power in the advent of the Arab Spring”. The Nobel committee stated that Karman was specifically awarded the prize because of her “non-violent struggle for the safety of women”. (“Profile: Tawakul Karman” Al Jazeera) Since 2007, Karman has organized and led demonstrations and sit-ins on numerous occasions with numerous Yemeni women intent on gaining more equality.\n\n\n"}
