{"id": "1347963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1347963", "title": "Aimoré", "text": "Aimoré\n\nThe Aimoré \"(Aymore, Aimboré)\" are one of several South American peoples of eastern Brazil called Botocudo in Portuguese (from \"botoque\", a plug), in allusion to the wooden disks or tembetás worn in their lips and ears. Some called themselves Nac-nanuk or Nac-poruk, meaning \"sons of the soil\". The last Aimoré group to retain their language are the Krenak. The other peoples called Botocudo were the Xokleng and Xeta.\n\nThe Brazilian chief who was presented to King Henry VIII in 1532 wore small bones hung from his cheeks and from the lower lip a semi-precious stone the size of a pea. These were the marks of great bravery. When the Portuguese adventurer Vasco Fernando Coutinho reached the east coast of Brazil in 1535, he erected a fort at the head of Espírito Santo Bay to defend himself against the Aimorés and other tribes.\n\nThe tribe's original territory was in Espírito Santo, and reached inland to the headwaters of the Rio Grande (Belmonte) and Doce River on the eastern slopes of the Espinhaço Mountains. The Botocudos were gradually expelled by European colonists westward beyond the Serra dos Aimorés into Minas Gerais. It was in the latter district that at the close of the 18th century they came into collision with the Europeans, who were attracted there by the diamond fields.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century many Botocudo tribes still existed, numbering between 13,000 and 14,000 individuals. During the earlier frontier wars of 1790-1820, every effort was made to destroy them. Smallpox was deliberately spread among them; poisoned food was scattered in the forests; by such infamous means, the coast districts about Rio Doce and Belmonte were cleared, and one Portuguese commander boasted that he had either slain with his own hands or ordered to be butchered many hundreds of them.\n\nPaul Ehrenreich estimated their population at 5,000 in 1884. As of April 1939, only 68 Botocudo were alive in Eastern Brazil. They were divided into two groups. The first group numbered 10 people (belonging to Naknyanuk, Arana and Poyica tribes) and lived near Itambacuri. The second group were divided into two bands residing at Guido Marliere, on the Doce River. One band consisted of 8 survivors from the Naktun, Nakpie, Convugn and Miyã-Yirúgn tribes. Another band consisted of around 50 Nakrehe.\n\nToday, only a few tribes remain, almost all of them in rural villages and the indigenous territory. The last remnants of the Eastern Botocudo are the Krenak. In 2010, there were 350 Krenak living in the state of Minas Gerais.\n\nThe Aimoré consisted of dozens of tribes, who spoke either dialects or closely related languages. Some of the important tribes are:\n\n\nThe Botocudos were nomadic hunter-gatherers, wandering naked in the woods and living from the forest. Their implements and domestic utensils were all of wood; their only weapons were reed spears and bows and arrows. Their dwellings were rough shelters of leaf and bast, seldom high. Their only musical instrument was a small bamboo nose flute. They attributed all the blessings of life to the day-fire (Sun) and all evil to night-fire (Moon). At the graves of the dead, they kept fires burning for some days to scare away evil spirits, and, during storms and eclipses, arrows were shot into the sky to drive away demons.\n\nThe most conspicuous feature of the Botocudos was the \"tembeitera\", a wooden plug or disk which is worn in the lower lip and the lobe of the ear. This disk, made of the specially light and carefully dried wood of the barriguda tree (\"Chorisia ventricosa\"), which was called by the natives themselves \"embur\", whence Augustin Saint-Hilaire suggested that this could be the probable derivation of their name Aimboré (1830). It is worn only in the under-lip, now chiefly by women, but formerly by men also. The operation for preparing the lip begins often as early as the eighth year, when an initial boring is made by a hard pointed stick, and gradually extended by the insertion of larger and larger disks or plugs, sometimes at last as much as 10 cm in diameter. Notwithstanding the lightness of the wood the tembeitera weighs down the lip, which at first sticks out horizontally and at last becomes a mere ring of skin around the wood. Ear-plugs are also worn, of such size as to distend the lobe down to the shoulders. Ear-ornaments of like nature are common in south and even Central America, at least as far north as Honduras, as described by Christopher Columbus when he discovered this latter country during his fourth voyage (1502). This ornament also named part of the Peru seaboard as Costa de la Oreja, from the conspicuously distended ears of the native Chimú. Early Spanish explorers also gave the name Orejones or big-eared to several Amazon tribes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "319799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319799", "title": "Ayman al-Zawahiri", "text": "Ayman al-Zawahiri\n\nAyman Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri (\"\"; born June 19, 1951) is the current leader of al-Qaeda and a current or former member and senior official of Islamist organizations which have orchestrated and carried out attacks in North America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. In 2012, he called on Muslims to kidnap Western tourists in Muslim countries.\n\nSince the September 11 attacks, the U.S. State Department has offered a US$25 million reward for information or intelligence leading to al-Zawahiri's capture. He is under worldwide sanctions by the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee as a member of al-Qaeda.\n\nAyman Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri is pronounced or in Arabic. Zawahiri is usually spelled Zawahri (from the pronunciation in his native Egyptian Arabic), but is sometimes spelled \"Dhawahri\" if transliterated directly from Modern Standard Arabic, also called Literary Arabic, in certain academic circles. Using the Intelligence Community Standard for the Transliteration of Arabic Names, it is spelled Zawahri.\n\nAl-Zawahiri has also gone under following names: Abu Muhammad / Abu Mohammed (أبو محمّد), Abu Fatima (أبو فاطمة), Muhammad Ibrahim (محمّد إبراهيم), Abu Abdallah (أبو عبدالله), Abu al-Mu'iz (أبو المعز), The Doctor, The Teacher, Nur (نور), Ustaz (أستاذ), Abu Mohammed Nur al-Deen (أبو محمّد نورالدين), Abdel Muaz / Abdel Moez / Abdel Muez (عبدالمعز).\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri was born in 1951 in the neighborhood of Maadi, Cairo, in the then Kingdom of Egypt, to Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri and Umayma Azzam.\n\nThe al-Zawahiri family was considered \"distinguished\" while they lived in Maadi. Al-Zawahiri's parents both came from prosperous families. Al-Zawahiri's father, Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, came from a large family of doctors and scholars. Mohammed Rabie became a surgeon and a professor of pharmacy at Cairo University. Ayman's mother, Umayma Azzam, came from a wealthy, politically active clan. Ayman has said that he has a deep affection for his mother. Her brother, Mahfouz Azzam, became a role model for Ayman as a teenager. Ayman has a younger brother, Muhammad al-Zawahiri, and a twin sister, Heba Mohamed al-Zawahiri. Al-Zawahiri's sister, Heba Mohamed al-Zawahiri, became a professor of medical oncology at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. She described her brother as \"silent and shy\". Al-Zawahiri's brother, Muhammad al-Zawahiri, was sent to the Balkans by his older brother in 1993. Ayman al-Zawahiri sent Muhammad to meet with Alija Izetbegović, commander of the 3rd Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with senior staff officers attached and religious leaders, to check the Islamisation of the Bosnian Army and the funds received for the mujahedeen fighters in Bosnia. Muhammad was known as a logistics expert and is said to be the military commander of Islamic Jihad. Muhammad worked in Bosnia, Croatia, and Albania under the cover of being an International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) official. While hiding in the United Arab Emirates, he was arrested in 2000, then extradited to Egypt, where he was sentenced to death. He was held in Tora Prison in Cairo as a political detainee. Security officials said he was the head of the Special Action Committee of Islamic Jihad, which organized terrorist operations. However, after the Egyptian popular uprising in the spring of 2011, on March 17, 2011, he was released from prison by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the interim government of Egypt. His lawyer said he had been held to extract information about his brother Ayman. However, on March 20, 2011, he was re-arrested. On August 17, 2013, Egyptian authorities arrested Muhammad al-Zawahiri at his home in Giza.\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri was reportedly a studious youth. Ayman excelled in school, loved poetry, and \"hated violent sports\" — which he thought were \"inhumane.\" Al-Zawahiri studied medicine at Cairo University and graduated in 1974 with \"gayyid giddan\". Following that, he served three years as a surgeon in the Egyptian Army after which he established a clinic near his parents in Maadi. In 1978, he also earned a master's degree in surgery. Ayman al-Zawahiri has also shown a radical understanding of Islamic theology and Islamic history. He speaks Arabic, English, and French.\n\nAl-Zawahiri participated in Youth activism as a student. He became both quite pious and political, under the influence of his uncle Mahfouz Azzam, and lecturer Mostafa Kamel Wasfi.\nSayyid Qutb preached that to restore Islam and free Muslims, a vanguard of true Muslims modeling itself after the original Companions of the Prophet had to be developed.\n\nBy the age of 14, al-Zawahiri had joined the Muslim Brotherhood. The following year the Egyptian government executed Qutb for conspiracy, and al-Zawahiri, along with four other secondary school students, helped form an \"underground cell devoted to overthrowing the government and establishing an Islamist state.\" It was at this early age that al-Zawahiri developed a mission in life, \"to put Qutb's vision into action.\" His cell eventually merged with others to form al-Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Jihad.\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri has been married at least four times. His wives include Azza Ahmed Nowari and Umaima Hassan.\n\nIn 1978, al-Zawahiri married his first wife, Azza Ahmed Nowari, a student at Cairo University who was studying philosophy. Their wedding, which was held at the Continental Hotel in Opera Square, was very conservative, with separate areas for both men and women, and no music, photographs, or light-hearted humour. Many years later, when the United States attacked Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks in October 2001, Azza apparently had no idea that al-Zawahiri had supposedly been a jihadi emir (commander) for the last decade. In June 2012, one of Zawahiri's four wives, Umaima Hassan, released a statement on the internet congratulating the role played by Muslim women in the Arab Spring.\n\nAl-Zawahiri and his wife, Azza, had four daughters, Fatima (born 1981), Umayma (born 1983), Nabila (born 1986), and Khadiga (born 1987), and a son, Mohammed (also born in 1987; the twin brother of Khadiga), who was a \"delicate, well-mannered boy\" and \"the pet of his older sisters,\" subject to teasing and bullying in a traditional all-male environment, who preferred to \"stay at home and help his mother.\" In 1997, ten years after the birth of Mohammed, Azza gave birth to their fifth daughter, Aisha, who had Down syndrome. In February 2004, Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded and subsequently stated that Abu Turab Al-Urduni had married one of al-Zawahiri's daughters.\n\nIn the first half of 2005, one of Al-Zawahiri's three surviving wives gave birth to a daughter, named Nawwar.\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri's first wife Azza and two of their six children, Mohammad and Aisha, were killed in an air strike on Afghanistan by US forces in late December 2001, following the September 11 attacks on the U.S. After an American aerial bombardment of a Taliban-controlled building at Gardez, Azza was pinned under debris of a guesthouse roof. Concerned for her modesty, she \"refused to be excavated\" because \"men would see her face\" and she died from her injuries the following day. Her son, Mohammad, was also killed outright in the same house. Her four-year-old daughter with Down syndrome, Aisha, had not been hurt by the bombing, but died from exposure in the cold night while Afghan rescuers tried to save Azza.\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri worked in the medical field as a surgeon. In 1985, al-Zawahiri went to Saudi Arabia on Hajj and stayed to practice medicine in Jeddah for a year. As a reportedly qualified surgeon, when his organization merged with bin Laden's al-Qaeda, he became bin Laden's personal advisor and physician. He had first met bin Laden in Jeddah in 1986.\n\nIn 1981, Ayman al-Zawahiri also traveled to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he worked in a Red Crescent hospital treating wounded refugees. There he became friends with Ahmed Khadr, and the two shared a number of conversations about the need for Islamic government and the needs of the Afghan people.\n\nIn 1993, al-Zawahiri traveled to the United States, where he addressed several California mosques under his \"Abdul Mu'iz\" pseudonym, relying on his credentials from the Kuwaiti Red Crescent to raise money for Afghan children who had been injured by Soviet land mines—he only raised $2000.\n\nIn 1981, Al-Zawahiri was one of hundreds arrested following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. Initially, the plan was derailed when authorities were alerted to Al-Jihad's plan by the arrest of an operative carrying crucial information, in February 1981. President Sadat ordered the roundup of more than 1500 people, including many Al-Jihad members, but missed a cell in the military led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli, who succeeded in assassinating Sadat during a military parade that October. His lawyer, Montasser el-Zayat, said that Zawahiri was tortured in prison.\n\nIn his book, \"Al-Zawahiri as I Knew Him\", Al-Zayat maintains that under torture by the Egyptian police, following his arrest in connection with the murder of Sadat in 1981, Al-Zawahiri revealed the hiding place of Essam al-Qamari, a key member of the Maadi cell of al-Jihad, which led to Al-Qamari's \"arrest and eventual execution.\"\n\nIn 1993, al-Zawahiri's and Egyptian Islamic Jihad's (EIJ) connection with Iran may have led to a suicide bombing in an attempt on the life of Egyptian Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, the man heading the effort to quash the campaign of Islamist killings in Egypt. It failed, as did an attempt to assassinate Egyptian prime minister Atef Sidqi three months later. The bombing of Sidqi's car injured 21 Egyptians and killed a schoolgirl, Shayma Abdel-Halim. It followed two years of killings by another Islamist group, al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, that had killed over 200 people. Her funeral became a public spectacle, with her coffin carried through the streets of Cairo and crowds shouting, \"Terrorism is the enemy of God!\" The police arrested 280 more of al-Jihad's members and executed six.\n\nFor their leading role in anti-Egyptian Government attacks in the 1990s, al-Zawahiri and his brother Muhammad al-Zawahiri were sentenced to death in the 1999 Egyptian case of the Returnees from Albania.\n\nThe 1995 attack on the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, was the Egyptian Islamic Jihad's first success under Zawahiri's leadership, but Bin Laden had disapproved of the operation. The bombing alienated Pakistan, which was \"the best route into Afghanistan\".\n\nIn July 2007, Al-Zawahiri supplied direction for the Lal Masjid siege, codename Operation Silence. This was the first confirmed time that Al-Zawahiri was taking militant steps against the Pakistan Government and guiding Islamic militants against the State of Pakistan. The Pakistan Army troops and Special Service Group taking control of the Lal Masjid (\"Red Mosque\") in Islamabad found letters from al-Zawahiri directing Islamic militants Abdul Rashid Ghazi and Abdul Aziz Ghazi, who ran the mosque and adjacent madrasah. This conflict resulted in 100 deaths.\n\nOn December 27, 2007, al-Zawahiri was also implicated in the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.\n\nIn 1994, the sons of Ahmad Salama Mabruk and Mohammed Sharaf were executed under al-Zawahiri's leadership for betraying Egyptian Islamic Jihad; the militants were ordered to leave the Sudan.\n\nIn 1998, Ayman al-Zawahiri was listed as under indictment in the United States for his role in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, a series of attacks that occurred on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people were killed in simultaneous truck bomb explosions at the United States embassies in the major East African cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya. The attacks brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to international attention.\n\nIn 2000, the USS \"Cole\" bombing encouraged several members to depart. Mohammed Atef went to escape Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he realised no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.\n\nOn October 10, 2001, al-Zawahiri appeared on the initial list of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's top 22 Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by U.S. President George W. Bush. In early November 2001, the Taliban government announced they were bestowing official Afghan citizenship on him, as well as Bin Laden, Mohammed Atef, Saif al-Adl, and Shaykh Asim Abdulrahman.\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri was previously the second and last \"emir\" of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, having succeeded Abbud al-Zumar in the latter role when Egyptian authorities sentenced al-Zumar to life imprisonment. Ayman al-Zawahiri eventually became one of Egyptian Islamic Jihad's leading organizers and recruiters. Zawahiri's hope was to recruit military officers and accumulate weapons, waiting for the right moment to launch \"a complete overthrow of the existing order.\" Chief strategist of Al-Jihad was Aboud al-Zumar, a colonel in the military intelligence whose plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture the headquarters of the army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashing – he expected – \"a popular uprising against secular authority all over the country.\"\n\nIn Peshawar, he met up with Osama bin Laden, who was running a base for \"mujahideen\" called Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK); founded by the Palestinian Sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam. The radical position of al-Zawahiri and the other militants of Al-Jihad put them at odds with Sheikh Azzam, with whom they competed for bin Laden's financial resources. Zawahiri carried two false passports, a Swiss one in the name of Amin Uthman and a Dutch one in the name of Mohmud Hifnawi.\n\nBritish journalist Jason Burke wrote: \"Al-Zawahiri ran his own operation during the Afghan war, bringing in and training volunteers from the Middle East. Some of the $500 million the CIA poured into Afghanistan reached his group.\"\n\nFormer FBI agent Ali Soufan mentioned in his book \"The Black Banners\" that Ayman al-Zawahiri is suspected of being behind Azzam's assassination in 1989.\n\nIn 1998, al-Zawahiri formally merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad into al-Qaeda. According to reports by a former al-Qaeda member, he has worked in the al-Qaeda organization since its inception and was a senior member of the group's \"shura\" council. He was often described as a \"lieutenant\" to Osama bin Laden, though bin Laden's chosen biographer has referred to him as the \"real brains\" of al-Qaeda.\n\nOn February 23, 1998, al-Zawahiri issued a joint fatwa with Osama bin Laden under the title \"World Islamic Front Against Jews and Crusaders\". Zawahiri, not bin Laden, is thought to have been the actual author of the fatwa.\n\nBin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized an al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998. A week prior to the beginning of the conference, a group of well-armed assistants to al-Zawahiri had left by jeeps in the direction of Herat. Following the instructions of their patron, in the town of Koh-i-Doshakh, they met three unknown Slavic-looking men who had arrived from Russia via Iran. After their arrival in Kandahar, they split up. One of the Russians was directly escorted to al-Zawahiri and he did not participate in the conference. Western military intelligence succeeded in acquiring photographs of him, but he disappeared for six years. According to Axis Globe, in 2004, when Qatar and the U.S. investigated Russian embassy officials whom the United Arab Emirates had arrested in connection to the murder of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in Qatar, computer software precisely established that a man who had walked to the Russian embassy in Doha was the same one who visited al-Zawahiri prior to the Al-Qaida conference.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, the U.S. State Department reported that al-Zawahiri had emerged as al-Qaeda's operational and strategic commander and that Osama bin Laden was now only the ideological figurehead of the organization. However, after the 2011 death of bin Laden, a senior U.S. intelligence official was quoted as saying intelligence gathered in the raid showed that bin Laden remained deeply involved in planning: “This compound (where bin Laden was killed) in Abbottabad was an active command-and-control center for al-Qaeda’s leader. He was active in operational planning and in driving tactical decisions within al-Qaeda.”\n\nFollowing the death of bin Laden, former U.S. Deputy National Security Advisor for Combating Terrorism Juan Zarate said that al-Zawahiri would \"clearly assume the mantle of leadership\" of al-Qaeda. However, a senior U.S. administration official said that although al-Zawahiri was likely to be al-Qaeda's next leader, his authority was not \"universally accepted\" among al-Qaeda's followers, particularly in the Gulf region. Zarate said that al-Zawahiri was more controversial and less charismatic than bin Laden. Rashad Mohammad Ismail (AKA \"Abu Al-Fida\"), a leading member of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, stated that al-Zawahiri was the best candidate.\n\nHamid Mir is reported to have said that he believed that Ayman al-Zawahiri was the operational head of al-Qaeda, and that \"[h]e is the person who can do the things that happened on September 11.\" Within days of the attacks, Zawahiri's name was put forward as bin Laden's second-in-command, with reports suggesting he represented \"a more formidable US foe than bin Laden.\"\n\n, he became the leader of al-Qaeda following the death of Osama bin Laden. This was confirmed by a press release from al-Qaeda's general command on June 16. Al-Zawahiri's succession to command of al-Qaeda was announced on several of their websites on June 16, 2011. On the same day, al-Qaeda renewed its position that Israel was an illegitimate state and that it wouldn't accept any compromise on Palestine.\n\nThe delayed announcement led some analysts to speculate that there was quarreling within al-Qaeda: \"It doesn't suggest a vast reservoir of accumulated goodwill for him,\" said one celebrity journalist on CNN. Both U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen maintain that the delay didn't signal any kind of dispute within al-Qaeda, and Mullen reiterated U.S. death threats toward al-Zawahiri. According to U.S. officials within the Obama administration and Robert Gates, al-Zawahiri would find the leadership difficult as, while intelligent, he lacks combat experience and the charisma of Osama bin Laden.\n\nAl-Zawahiri was convicted of dealing in weapons and received a three-year sentence, which he completed in 1984, shortly after his conviction.\n\nAt some point in 1994, al-Zawahiri was said to have \"become \" but is thought to have traveled widely to \"Switzerland and Sarajevo\". A fake passport he was using shows that he traveled to Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.\n\nOn December 1, 1996, Ahmad Salama Mabruk and Mahmud Hisham al-Hennawi – both carrying false passports – accompanied al-Zawahiri on a trip to Chechnya, where they hoped to re-establish the faltering Jihad. Their leader was traveling under the pseudonym \"Abdullah Imam Mohammed Amin\", and trading on his medical credentials for legitimacy. The group switched vehicles three times, but were arrested within hours of entering Russian territory and spent five months in a Makhachkala prison awaiting trial. The trio pleaded innocence, maintaining their disguise and having other al-Jihad members from \"Bavari-C\" send the Russian authorities pleas for leniency for their \"merchant\" colleagues who had been wrongly arrested; and Russian Member of Parliament Nadyr Khachiliev echoed the pleas for their speedy release as al-Jihad members Ibrahim Eidarous and Tharwat Salah Shehata traveled to Dagestan to plead for their release. Shehata received permission to visit the prisoners, and is believed to have smuggled them $3000 which was later confiscated from their cell, and to have given them a letter which the Russians didn't bother to translate. In April 1997, the trio were sentenced to six months, and were subsequently released a month later and ran off without paying their court-appointed attorney Abulkhalik Abdusalamov his $1,800 legal fee citing their \"poverty\". Shehata was sent on to Chechnya, where he met with Ibn Khattab.\n\nDuring this time, al-Zawahiri also began reconstituting the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) along with other exiled militants. The group had \"very loose ties to their imprisoned leader, Abud al-Zumur.\"\n\nIn Peshwar, al-Zawahiri is thought to have become radicalized by other Al-Jihad members, abandoning his old strategy of a swift coup d'état to change society from above, and embracing the idea of takfir. In 1991, EIJ broke with al-Zumur, and al-Zawahiri grabbed \"the reins of power\" to become EIJ leader.\n\nZawahiri has allegedly worked with the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of al-Qaeda. Lawrence Wright reports that EIJ operative Ali Mohammed \"told the FBI that al-Jihad had planned a coup in Egypt in 1990.\" Zawahiri had studied the 1979 Islamist Islamic Revolution and \"sought training from the Iranians\" as to how to duplicate their feat against the Egyptian government.\n\nHe offered Iran information about an Egyptian government plan to storm several islands in the Persian Gulf that both Iran and the United Arab Emirates lay claim to. According to Mohammed, in return for this information, the Iranian government paid Zawahiri $2 million and helped train members of al-Jihad in a coup attempt that never actually took place.\n\nHowever, in public Zawahiri has harshly denounced the Iranian government. In December 2007 he said, \"We discovered Iran collaborating with America in its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.\" In the same video messages, he moreover chides Iran for \"repeating the ridiculous joke that says that al-Qaida and the Taliban are agents of America,\" before playing a video clip in which Ayatollah Rafsanjani says, \"In Afghanistan, they were present in Afghanistan, because of Al-Qa'ida; and the Taliban, who created the Taliban? America is the one who created the Taliban, and America's friends in the region are the ones who financed and armed the Taliban.\"\n\nZawahiri's criticism of Iran's government continues when he states,\n\nDespite Iran's repetition of the slogan 'Death to America, death to Israel,' we haven't heard even one Fatwa from one Shiite authority, whether in Iran or elsewhere, calling for Jihad against the Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nZawahiri has dismissed that there is any cooperation between Iran and Al Qaeda against their common enemy, \"viz\", the United States. He also said that \"Iran of the Islamic Nation.\"\n\nIn April 2008, Zawahiri blamed Iranian state media and Al-Manar for perpetuating the \"lie\" that \"there are no heroes among the Sunnis who can hurt America as no-one else did in history\" in order to discredit the Al Qaeda network. Zawahiri was referring to some 9/11 conspiracy theories according to which Al Qaeda was not responsible for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOn the seventh anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, Zawahiri released a 90-minute tape in which he \"the guardian of Muslims in Tehran\" for recognizing \"the two governments\" in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThere have been doubts as to the true nature of al-Zawahiri's encounter with the Russians in 1996. Washington, D.C.-based Jamestown Foundation scholar Evgenii Novikov has argued that it seems unlikely that the Russians would not have been able to determine who he was, given their well-trained Arabists and the obviously suspicious act of Muslims crossing illegally a border with multiple false identities and encrypted documents in Arabic. Assassinated former FSB secret service officer Alexander Litvinenko alleged, among other things, that during this time, al-Zawahiri was indeed being trained by the FSB, and that he was not the only link between al-Qaeda and the FSB. Former KGB officer, speaker on the Voice of America and writer Konstantin Preobrazhenskiy supported Litvinenko's claim and said that Litvinenko \"was responsible for securing the secrecy of Al-Zawahiri's arrival in Russia, who was trained by FSB instructors in Dagestan, Northern Caucasus, during 1996–1997.\"\n\nWhile there Zawahiri learned of a \"Nonviolence Initiative\" being organized in Egypt to end the terror campaign that had killed hundreds and resulting government crackdown that had imprisoned thousands. Zawahiri angrily opposed this \"surrender\" in letters to the London newspaper \"Al-Sharq al-Awsat\". Together with members of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, he helped organize a massive attack on tourists at the Temple of Hatshepsut to sabotage the initiative by provoking the government into repression.\n\nThe attack by six men dressed in police uniforms succeeded in machine-gunning and hacking to death 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians, including \"a five-year-old British child and four Japanese couples on their honeymoons,\" and devastated the Egyptian tourist industry for a number of years. Nonetheless the Egyptian reaction was not what Zawahiri had hoped for. The attack so stunned and angered Egyptian society that Islamists denied responsibility. Zawahiri blamed the police for the killing, but also held the tourists responsible for their own deaths for coming to Egypt,\nThe people of Egypt consider the presence of these foreign tourists to be aggression against Muslims and Egypt... The young men are saying that this is our country and not a place for frolicking and enjoyment, especially for you.\n\nThe massacre was so unpopular that no terror attacks occurred in Egypt for several years thereafter. Zawahiri was sentenced to death \"in absentia\" in 1999 by an Egyptian military tribunal.\n\nIn December 2001, al-Zawahiri published a book entitled Fursan That Rayal al Nabi (\"Knights Under the Prophet's Banner\") which outlined ideologies of al-Qaeda. English translations of this book were published; excerpts are available online.\n\nAl-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri (2001) in \"Knights Under the Prophet's Banner\" which was released by Al-Sharq Al-Awsat.\n\nFollowing the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, al-Zawahiri's whereabouts are unknown, but he is generally thought to be in tribal Pakistan. Although he releases videos of himself frequently \"(see Messages of Ayman al-Zawahiri)\", al-Zawahiri did not appear alongside bin Laden in any of them after 2003. In 2003, it was rumored that he was under arrest in Iran, although this was later discovered to be false. In 2004, the Pakistan Army launched an aggressive operation in Wana, Pakistan. Reports began to surface that he was trapped in the center of the conflict by the army. But when, after weeks of fighting, the army captured the area, it was later revealed that he either escaped or was never among the fighters. As the conflict spread into the tribal areas of western Pakistan, Ayman al-Zawahiri became a prime target of the ISI's Directorate for Joint Counterintelligence Bureau (J-COIN Bureau). However, despite a series of operations they were unable to capture him.\nOn January 13, 2006, the Central Intelligence Agency, aided by Pakistan's ISI, launched an airstrike on Damadola, a Pakistani village near the Afghan border where they believed al-Zawahiri was located. The airstrike was supposed to kill al-Zawahiri and this was reported in international news over the following days. Many victims of the airstrike were buried without being identified. Anonymous U.S. government officials claimed that some terrorists were killed and the Bajaur tribal area government confirmed that at least four terrorists were among the dead. Anti-American protests broke out around the country and the Pakistani government condemned the U.S. attack and the loss of innocent life. On January 30, a new video was released showing al-Zawahiri unhurt. The video discussed the airstrike, but did not reveal if al-Zawahiri was present in the village at that time.\n\nOn August 1, 2008, CBS News reported that it had obtained a copy of an intercepted letter dated July 29, 2008, from unnamed sources in Pakistan, which urgently requested a doctor to treat al-Zawahiri. The letter indicated that al-Zawahiri was critically injured in a US missile strike at Azam Warsak village in South Waziristan on July 28 that also reportedly killed al Qaeda explosives expert Abu Khabab al-Masri. Taliban Mehsud spokesman Maulvi Umar told the Associated Press on August 2, 2008, that the report of al-Zawahiri's injury was false.\n\nIn early September 2008, Pakistan Army claimed that they \"almost\" captured al-Zawahiri after getting information that he and his wife were in the Mohmand Agency, in northwest Pakistan. After raiding the area, officials didn't find him.\n\nIn June 2013, al-Zawahiri arbitrated against the merger of the Islamic State of Iraq with the Syrian-based Jabhat al-Nusra into Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as was declared in April by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Abu Mohammad al-Julani, leader of al-Nusra Front, affirmed the group's allegiance to al-Qaeda and al-Zawahiri.\n\nIn September 2015, Zawahiri urged Islamic State (ISIL) to stop fighting al-Nusra Front, the official al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, and to unite with all other jihadists against the supposed alliance between America, Russia, Europe, Shiites and Iran, and Bashar al-Assad’s Alawite regime.\n\nAyman al-Zawahiri released a statement supporting jihad in Xinjiang against Chinese, jihad in the Caucasus against the Russians and naming Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan as battlegrounds. Zawahiri endorsed \"jihad to liberate every span of land of the Muslims that has been usurped and violated, from Kashgar to Andalusia, and from the Caucasus to Somalia and Central Africa\". Uyghurs inhabit Kashgar, the city which was mentioned by Zawahiri. In another statement he said, \"My mujahideen brothers in all places and of all groups ... we face aggression from America, Europe, and Russia ... so it's up to us to stand together as one from East Turkestan to Morocco\". In 2015, the Turkistan Islamic Party (East Turkistan Islamic Movement) released an image showing Al Qaeda leaders Ayman al Zawahiri and Osama Bin Laden meeting with Hasan Mahsum.\n\nThe Uyghurs East Turkestan independence movement was endorsed in the serial \"Islamic Spring”'s 9th release by Al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri confirmed that the Afghanistan war after 9/11 included the participation of Uighurs and that the jihadists like Zarwaqi, Bin Ladin and the Uyghur Hasan Mahsum were provided with refuge together in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Uyghur fighters were praised by Zawahiri, before a Turkistan Islamic Party performed a Bishkek bombing on 30 August. Uighur jihadists were hailed by Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nDoğu Türkistan Bülteni Haber Ajansı reported that the Uyghur Turkistan Islamic Party was praised by Abu Qatada along with Abdul Razzaq al Mahdi, Maqdisi, Muhaysini and Zawahiri.\n\nAbu Muhammad al-Maqdisi and Abu Qatada were referenced by Muhaysini. Al-Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri were by Muhaysini.\n\nPresently, the Rewards for Justice Program of the U.S. Department of State is offering a reward of up to US$25 million for information about his location.\n\n\nIn a lengthy treatise titled \"Loyalty and Enmity\", Zawahiri argues that Muslims must at all times be loyal to Islam and to one another, while hating or at least being clean from everything and everyone outside of Islam.\n\nZawahiri has said in an interview that the group does not have women combatants and that a woman's role is limited to caring for the homes and children of al-Qaeda fighters. This resulted in a debate regarding the role of mujahid women like Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi.\n\nZawahiri places supreme importance on winning public support, and castigated Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in this regard: \"In the absence of this popular support the Islamic mujahid movement would be crushed in the shadows.\"\n\n\n\nIn mid-December 2007, al-Zawahiri's spokespeople announced plans for an \"open interview\" on a handful of Islamic Web sites. The administrators of 4 known jihadist web sites have been authorized to collect and forward questions, \"unedited\", they pledge, and \"regardless of whether they are in support of or are against\" al-Qaeda, which would be forwarded to al-Zawahiri on January 16. al-Zawahiri responded to the questions later in 2008; among the things he said were that al-Qaeda didn't kill innocents, and that al-Qaeda would move to target Israel \"after expelling the occupier from Iraq\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1222736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1222736", "title": "Bone rank system", "text": "Bone rank system\n\nThe bone rank system was the system of aristocratic rank used in the ancient Korean kingdom of Silla. It was used to segregate society, and particularly the layers of the aristocracy, on the basis of their hereditary proximity to the throne and the level of authority they were permitted to wield. The idea of royal blood in other societies is a close analogue to the idea of \"sacred bone\" in Silla thought.\n\nBone rank was strictly hereditary, and thus acted as a caste system. The scholar, Lee Ki-Baik (1984, p. 43) considers it to have probably been adopted as part of the administrative law introduced from China and promulgated by King Beopheung in 520. However, this likely did nothing but institute in legal fact what was already a society segregated by bloodline and lineage. Although only two of the five known ranks were referred to as \"bone\" (골, 骨), the term \"bone rank\" has become widely used to describe the whole system.\n\nA person's bone rank status governed not only official status and marriage rights, but also the color of one's garments and the maximum dimensions of one's dwelling and carriage. These criteria are described in detail in the 12th century Korean history \"Samguk Sagi\", particularly its Monographs (\"ji\" 志), book 2 (ranks and offices). The \"Samguk Sagi\"'s depiction of Silla life, however, has often been criticized for being excessively static. Unfortunately, since other sources are scarce, it is difficult to judge what sort of changes may have taken place in the bone rank system over the centuries.\nThe highest level of the bone rank was the \"sacred bone\", or seonggol (성골, 聖骨), sometimes termed \"hallowed bone\", which consisted only of a portion of the royal Kim family, possibly those considered to have royal blood on both sides. Until this rank was abolished with the ascension of King Muyeol in 654, only those holding sacred bone rank were permitted to assume the throne. This led to the crowning of Queen Seondeok in 632 and Queen Jindeok in 647, because no males of the sacred bone rank were available. This situation may have led to its subsequent abolition.\n\nBelow the sacred bone came the \"true bone\", or jingol (진골, 眞骨), which included the rest of the royal family, as well as the Bak and Seok families of Gyeongju, which had held the throne in very early times and were involved in most royal marriages, as well as another Kim ['Kimhae' royal clan] lineage descended from the royal house of Geumgwan Gaya. Members of the true bone could hold any official position, up to the level of full minister. They could also attain office rank up to the highest, \"ibolchan\" (이벌찬). After the sacred bone rank was abolished under King Muyol, only those holding the true bone rank could become king.\n\nBelow the \"true bone\" came the head ranks (두품, 頭品), of which only the 6th, 5th and 4th are attested, 6th being the highest. The origins of these lower head rank classes and what defined one‘s status as such are obscure and still debated among scholars. As the \"jingol\" were prohibited from marrying into the lower ranks, though they could take concubines from them, it is feasible that one source of the head rank six were the children born from unions between \"jingol\" fathers and lower ranking concubines. In any case, members of the head rank six could rise to the position of vice-minister (\"gyeong\", 경, 卿) and as high as the 6th level of office rank, achan (아찬, 阿餐) (two higher ranks of \"jungachan\" (중아찬, 重阿餐) and \"sajung achan\" (사중아찬, 四重阿餐) were later supplemented to that of \"achan\" but these still fell within the 6th level). Members of head ranks four and five could rise only to minor posts. Members of head rank five could reach the 10th level of office rank, \"daenaema\" (대내마, 大奈麻), while members of head rank four could attain only the 12th level of office rank, \"daesa\" (대사, 大舍). There were 17 levels of office rank altogether. One scholar has proposed that, \"head-ranks three, two, and one, if they ever formally existed, must have designated the ... non-privileged general populace.\"\n\nThe frustrated ambitions of the head rank six class in particular seem to have played a prominent role in the politics of the late Silla period. Many men of head rank six status, proscribed from rising too high in the Silla administrative system defined by the bone rank system, sought to bypass this by studying Confucianism (either in Silla or abroad in Tang China) or else turned to careers in Buddhism. The most prominent of the head rank six figures was undoubtedly Choe Chiwon, who following an illustrious career in China returned to Silla only to see his attempts at administrative reform rebuffed by an entrenched aristocracy. In the early 10th century the nascent state of Goryeo, which succeeded Silla, tapped into the head rank six intellectuals to man its bureaucracy.\n\nThe bone rank system's extreme rigidity certainly helped to weaken Silla toward the end of the Unified Silla period, although numerous other factors were at play. After the fall of Silla, the bone rank system was abolished entirely, although different and somewhat more flexible caste systems persisted until near the end of the Joseon Dynasty in the late 19th century.\n\n"}

The Venetians settled in the State of Puebla, founding the city of Chipilo. This Venetian variety is also spoken in other communities in Veracruz and Querétaro, places where the \"chipileños\" settled as well.\n\nAlthough the city of Puebla has grown so far as to almost absorb it, the town of Chipilo remained isolated for much of the 20th century. Thus, the Cipiłàn/\"chipileños\", unlike other European immigrants that came to Mexico, did not blend into the Mexican culture and retained most of their traditions and their language. To this day, many of the people in Chipilo speak the \"Venetan\" or Venetian language of their great-grandparents. The variant of the Venetan language spoken by the Cipiłàn/\"chipileños\" is the northern Traixàn-Fheltrìn-Bełumàt. Surprisingly, it has been barely altered by Spanish, as compared to how the dialect of the northern Veneto has been altered by Italian. Given the number of speakers of Venetan, and even though the state government has not done so, the Venetan language has to be considered a minority language in the State of Puebla.\n\nThere have been several attempts to establish a writing system for the Venetian form spoken in Chipilo. One such system was created by Carolyn McKay, an American linguist who conducted postgraduate research at the Universidad de las Américas. Her proposed system, entirely based on the Italian alphabet, was published in a book entitled \"Il dialetto veneto di Segusino e Chipilo\". This system has been used in some publications made by Cipiłàn/\"chipileños\", but it has not received wide acceptance, because of the striking differences between Venetan and Italian phonemes. Most of the speakers use the Spanish system they learn at school, even though it does not have letters for specific sounds such as the voiced-S (written in modern Venetan), or the (written in modern Venetan), and (written in modern Venetan). Nevertheless, Eduardo Montagner, an Italo-Mexican from Chipilo, has suggested the standardization of a writing system based on the Spanish alphabet.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2904828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2904828", "title": "Crime in Sweden", "text": "Crime in Sweden\n\nCrime in Sweden describes an act defined in the Swedish Penal Code () or in another Swedish law or statutory instrument for which a sanction is prescribed.\n\nFigures from the 2013 Swedish Crime Survey (SCS) show that exposure to crime decreased from 2005 to 2013. Since 2014 there has been an increase in exposure to some categories of crimes, including fraud, some property crime and especially sexual offences (with a 70% increase since 2013) according to the 2016 SCS. Violence (both lethal and non-lethal) has been on a downward trend the last 25 years. The figures for fraud and property damage (excluding car theft) are in contrast with the numbers of reported crimes under such categories which have remained roughly constant over the period 2014–16. The number of reported sexual offences clearly reflect the figures in the 2016 SCS, and car related damages/theft are also somewhat reflected. The number of convictions up to 2013 has remained between 110,000 and 130,000 in the 2000s — a decrease since the 1970s, when they numbered around 300,000 — despite the population growth. Consistent with other Western countries in the postwar era, the number of reported crimes has increased when measured from the 1950s; which can be explained by a number of factors, such as statistical and legislative changes and increased public willingness to report crime.\n\nWhen a crime has been committed the authorities will investigate what has happened, this is known as the preliminary investigation and it will be led by a police officer or prosecutor. The Swedish police and the prosecution service are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware. The prosecutors are lawyers employed by the Swedish Prosecution Authority, a wholly independent organisation not dependent on courts or the police, and not directed by the Ministry of Justice (any ministerial interference is in fact unconstitutional).\n\nThe prosecutor are obliged to lead and direct the preliminary investigations of a crime impartially and objective, make decisions on prosecution issues, and appear in court to process actions in criminal cases. Suspects are entitled to a public defence counsel, either during the preliminary investigation stage or during the trial. The suspect is entitled to examine the material gathered by the prosecutor, and is allowed to request the police to conduct further investigation, if he or she considers this to be necessary. A preliminary investigation supervisor decides whether or not these measures can be carried out.\n\nIn the case of less serious crimes, if the suspect admits that he/she has committed the offence and it is clear what the punishment should be, the prosecutor can pronounce a so-called order of summary punishment. A preliminary investigation not discontinued may result in the prosecutor deciding to prosecute a person for the crime. This means that there will be a trial at the District Court. The person who has been convicted, the prosecutor and the victim of the crime can appeal against the District Court judgement in the Court of Appeal.\n\nSix out of ten respondents surveyed in the SCS 2013 said they had a high level of confidence in the criminal justice system as a whole, and the police enjoyed similarly high confidence levels. Of the crime victims, a little over half of all surveyed (57%) stated that their experience of the police was generally positive, and nearly one in seven stated that the experience was negative.\n\nIn general, the level of corruption in Sweden is very low. The legal and institutional framework in Sweden are considered effective in fighting against corruption, and the government agencies are characterized by a high degree of transparency, integrity and accountability.\n\nSweden began recording national crime statistics in 1950, and the method for recording crime has basically remained unchanged until the mid-1960s, when the Swedish police introduced new procedures for crime statistics, which have been presented as a partial explanation for the historical increase in crime reports. In 1974, the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (, abbreviated Brå) became the government agency tasked with producing official statistics and disseminating knowledge on crime. In the early 1990s a new crime reporting system was implemented, which meant that the manual controls became less frequent, resulting in an additional increase in the number of reported crimes.\n\nIn January 2017, the Löfven Cabinet denied the request from member parliament Staffan Danielsson to update the BRÅ statistics on crime with respect to national or immigration background of the perpetrator, as had previously been done in 1995, 2005 but the 2015 was overdue.\n\nComparisons between countries based on official crime statistics (i.e. \"crime reports\") require caution, since such statistics are produced differently in different countries. Legal and substantive factors also influence the number of reported crimes. For example:\n\n\nLarge-scale victimisation surveys have been presented as a more reliable indicator on the level of crime in a given country.\n\nBy 2018 gang violence, which had long been a feature of vulnerable areas, had begun to spill out into the wider society where hopsital staff reported armed confrontations in emergency rooms and school authorities reported that threats and weapons having become commonplace.\n\nThe Swedish Crime Survey (SCS) (sv:\"Nationella trygghetsundersökningen) is a recurrent victim survey since 2005 by Brå of the attitudes and experiences of the general population regarding victimization, fear of crime and public confidence in the justice system, with an annual sample size of around 15,000 respondents.\n\nThe level of exposure to offences against the person has decreased somewhat since 2005 (down from 13.1% to 11.4%), according to SCS 2013. Crimes in this group includes assault, threat, sexual offences, mugging, fraud or harassment. In the recently published SCS 2016, exposure to offences has increased to levels as seen prior to 2005, with 13.3% of the people surveyed reporting that they had been victim to one or more of the aforementioned crimes.\n\nAround one in four (26%) surveyed report these crimes, which is a decrease by 6 per cent from the previous year (2014).\n\nWhile the number of reported assaults has been on the increase, crime victim surveys show that a large part of the increase may be due to the fact that more crimes are actually reported. According to the 2013 SCS, the proportion who stated that they have been the victims of assault has declined gradually, from 2.7 per cent in 2005 to 1.9 per cent in 2012. The proportion who are anxious about falling victim to assault has also decreased, from 15 per cent in 2006 to 10 per cent in 2013. This is supported by medical services reporting unchanged levels of incoming patients with wounds derived from assault or serious violent crime. Studies have also shown that police are increasingly likely to personally initiate reports of assault between strangers, which contributes to more cases involving assault being reported.\n\nIn the recently published 2016 SCS 2.0 per cent of the population (ages 16–79) were exposed to assault. This level is similar to the previous year, when 2.1 per cent were exposed. Over time, exposure to assault has decreased somewhat, and the percentage of victims has declined by 0.7 percentage points since the survey was first conducted in 2005, reaching its lowest point in 2012 and rising slightly since then. The primary reduction has been among young men.\n\nExposure to assault is more common for men than women, and most common in the 20–24 age bracket. Assault is most common in a public place and in most cases the perpetrator is unknown to the victim.\n\nSweden has a high rate of reported assault crime when compared internationally, but this can be explained by legal, procedural and statistical differences. For example, the Swedish police applies a system of expansive offence counts for violent crimes, meaning the same crime may be recorded several times. The 2005 European Crime and Safety Survey (2005 EU ICS) found that prevalence victimisation rates for assaults with force was below average in Sweden.\n\nIn 2015, 5.0 per cent were exposed to threats, which is an increase compared with the preceding year (4.1% reported in 2014). The percentage of persons exposed to threats remained at a relatively stable level between 2005 and 2014. The results from coming years will show whether the increase in 2015 is the beginning of a new trend or a temporary deviation from an otherwise relatively stable level.\n\nExposure to threats is more common among women than men, and most common in the 20–24 and 25–34 age brackets.\n\nThe number of cases of lethal violence [Murder, manslaughter, and assault with a lethal outcome) in Sweden remained at a relatively constant level over the period of 2002 to 2016 — on average 92 cases per year. \n\nSince 2015 there has been an increase in the number of cases of lethal violence and the figure in 2017 was the highest in Sweden since 2002.\n\nStudies of lethal violence in Sweden have shown that more than half the reported cases were not actually cases of murder or manslaughter. This is because the Swedish crime statistics show all events with a lethal outcome that the police investigate. Many of these reported crimes turn out to be, in reality, suicides, accidents or natural deaths. \nDespite this statistical anomaly, Sweden has an internationally low murder and homicide rate, with approximately 1.14 reported incidents of murder or manslaughter per 100,000 inhabitants as of 2015. The number of \"confirmed cases of lethal violence\" has fluctuated between 68 and 112 in the period of 2006–2015, with a decrease from 111 in 2007 to 68 in 2012, followed by an increase to 112 in 2015 and a decrease to 106 in 2016. \n\nIn 2016 ten out of the 105 murder cases were honor killings, representing roughly 10% of all murder cases and a third of all murders of women in Sweden.\n\nIn May 2017 a survey by Dagens Nyheter showed that of 100 suspects of murder and attempted murder using firearms, 90 had one parent born abroad 75% were born in the 90s.\n\nAccording to a comparison of crime statistics from Norwegian Kripos and Swedish BRÅ done by Norwegian daily newspaper Aftenposten, the murder rate of Sweden has since 2002 been roughly twice that of neighbour country Norway.\n\nSweden witnessed a steep increase in gun violence in males aged 15 to 29 in the two decades prior to 2018, in addition to a rising trend in gun violence there was also a high rate of gun violence in Sweden compared to other countries in Western Europe.\n\nAccording to a report published by academic researchers in 2017, shooting incidents with fatal outcomes are about 4 to 5 times as common in Sweden compared to neighbouring countries such as Germany and Norway when taking population size into account. The city with the highest prevalence of shootings was Malmö. The grave violence in the studied period also changed character, from criminal motorcycle gangs to city suburbs. Sweden also stands out in having a low resolution rate (25%) for gun homicides compared to Germany and Finland at 90%.\n\nIn January 2018, police statistics reported an increase in gun homicides from 8 in 2006 to 43 in 2017. Analysis of 2011–2017 gang warfare showed that there were 1500 incidents involving firearms, 131 people had been killed and 520 injured.\n\nIn February 2018, criminologist Jerzy Sarnecki stated in an interview with magazine \"Forskning & Framsteg\" that the increasing levels of gun crime in Sweden had taken him, Swedish criminologists in general and police in Sweden by surprise. He characterised the recent developments as \"very serious\".\n\nA 2018 systematic review of 25 studies on firearm violence in Sweden concluded \"that even though knives/sharp weapons continue to be the most common MO in a violent crime in Sweden, firearm-related violence is significantly increasing in the country and foremost when discussing gang-related crimes. Moreover, firearm-related homicides and attempted homicides are increasing in the country. The studies also show that a firearm is much more lethal than a knife/sharp weapon... It is principally the three largest cities of Sweden which are affected by the many shootings in recent years.\"\n\nAccording to researcher Amir Rostami at Stockholm University. Police statistics for January-November 2018 showed that the number of shootings was at a continued high rate at 274, where up until the end of November 42 people had been shot and killed and 129 wounded compared to 43 in 2017. Rostami also said there had been 100 hand grenade attacks and 1500 shootings in Sweden since 2011, about 40 people are killed annually and 500 had been wounded. Rostami also said that if this violence had been attributed to some form of extremists, this would have considered a form of civil war. Almost half (46%) of all shootings in 2018 happened in public spaces in vulnerable areas. According to to a police report, both victims and perpetrators are becoming younger.\n\nAccrding to police in 2018, at least nine people who were innocent bystanders had been killed in cross-fire incidents in the last few years and the risk to the public was therefore rising.\n\nA long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement, have led to several legislative changes and amendments, greatly expanding the sex crime legislation. For example, in 1965 Sweden was one of the first countries in the world to criminalise marital rape, and Sweden is one of a few countries in the world to criminalizing only the purchase of sexual services, but not the selling.\n\nThe rate of exposure to sexual offences has remained relatively unchanged, according to the SCS, since the first survey was conducted in 2006, despite an increase in the number of reported sex crimes. This discrepancy can largely be explained by reforms in sex crime legislation, widening of the definition of rape, and an effort by the Government to decrease the number of unreported cases. In SCS 2013, 0.8 per cent of respondents state that they were the victims of sexual offences, including rape; or an estimated 62,000 people of the general population (aged 16–79). Of these, 16 per cent described the sexual offence as \"rape\" — which would mean approximately 36,000 incidents of rape in 2012.\n\nAccording to the 2016 SCS 1.7 per cent of persons stated that they had been exposed to a sexual offence. This is an increase of more than 100 per cent compared to 2012 and a 70 per cent compared to 2014, when 1.0 per cent of persons stated exposure. Exposure to sexual offences is significantly more common among women than men, and most common in the 20–24 age bracket. Sexual offences are most common in a public place and in most cases the perpetrator is unknown to the victim.\n\nSexual offences reported in the 2016 SCS amounts to an estimated 174,000 people of the general population (aged 16–79), a gross increase of 112,000 cases in a one-year period.\n\nA frequently cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) — although they discourage this practice. In 2012, according to the report by UNODC, Sweden was quoted as having 66.5 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population, based on official statistics by Brå. The high number of reported rapes in Sweden can partly be explained by differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions, making any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study published by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), approximately one third of all women in the EU were said to have suffered physical and/or sexual abuse. At the top end was Denmark (52%), Finland (47%) and Sweden (46%). Every second woman in the EU has experienced sexual harassment at least once since the age of 15. In Sweden that figure was 81 percent, closely followed by Denmark (80%) and France (75%). Included in the definition of \"sexual harassment\" was — among other things — inappropriate staring or leering and cyber harassment. The report concluded that there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence.\n\nIn its 2018 report, \"Nationella trygghetsundersökningen 2018\" (tr: \"national survey of safety 2018\") the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention stated that there had been an increase in the self-reported number of victims of sexual crime among from 4.7% in 2016 to 6.4% in 2017. In the 5 preceding years there were escalating levels compared to the 2005–2012 period where the level was relatively stable. The increase in self-reporte victimisation was greater among women than among men. while the number of male victims remained largely constant over the timespan (see graph). The questionnaire pollls for incidents which would equate to attempted sexual assault or rape according to Swedish law.\n\nThe rate of exposure to muggings has remained relatively unchanged since 2005, according to the SCS, with 0.9 per cent of respondents stating they were the victim of such a crime in 2015. There were 99 robberies recorded by police per 100,000 population in 2015, which is 3 per cent more than the previous year. The prevalence victimisation rates for robbery was slightly above the EU-average in 2004, and lower than countries such as Ireland, Estonia, Greece, Spain, The United Kingdom and Poland.\n\nA study published in 2000 by Brå on adolescent robberies in Stockholm and Malmö found that muggings had increased in the 90s, with approximately 10 per cent of the boys and 5 per cent of the girls aged 15–17 having been the target of a mugging. Desirable objects are mainly money and cell phones, with an average value of around SEK 800. Only half of the crime was reported to the police, and foreign-born youths were overrepresented in the offenders demographic. Follow-up studies have shown the level remaining unchanged between 1995 and 2005.\n\nThe SCS indicate that 9.2 per cent of households fell victim to some type of domestic property offence, which is a reduction since 2006 (when the percentage was 12.6). Crimes in this group includes theft, theft from a vehicle, bicycle theft or residential burglary. Around half of the domestic property offences reported in the SCS 2013 are stated as having been reported to the police, and the overwhelming majority of crime victims state that this happened only once in 2012.\n\nTheft of personal property and pickpocketing are among the lowest in Europe, as is car theft and theft from a car.\n\nSweden had the lowest prevalence victimisation rate for burglary in Europe, according to the 2005 EU ICS, and the rate of exposure to residential burglary has remained relatively unchanged since 2006. In SCS 2013, 0.9 percent of households stated that they were the victims of burglary in 2012. Sweden had 785 cases of reported burglary per 100,000 population in 2012, which is a reduction from the previous year by 6 percent.\nThe majority of burglaries in Sweden are committed by international gangs from Eastern European countries like the Balkans, Romania, Poland, the Baltic countries, and Georgia. The total number of burglaries in southern Sweden were 5871 in 2015 and 4802, the reduction was attributed to border checks introduced in November 2015 due to the ongoing European migrant crisis and police having manage to catch a number of gangs in 2016. The third reason for the reduction was community cooperation.\n\nSince Police in Sweden has a low conviction rate for burglaries there is also corresponding ignorance about who the burglars are.\n\nThe Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention received responsibility for compiling statistics in 1994, at which time the two main categories of offenders were youth and drug addicts. This pattern changed into one where the main category of offenders were organised gangs, some of which were composed of foreigners travelling to Sweden in order to commit crime and then return to their home countries again. In the Stockholm area police estimated in 2014 that a third of all burglaries were done by foreign nationals. In 2015 police were reported as estimating that foreign gangs comprising 1500 individuals were organised with some members living Sweden to coordinate thefts: a third of these gangs are from Lithuania, a fifth from Poland and the rest from Georgia, Belarus, Romania and Bulgaria. In 2017 police were reported as estimating that about half of the annual 20,000 burglaries, including failed attempts, were committed by gangs from the Balkans, Romania, the Baltic states and Georgia.\n\nThe percentage of persons exposed to harassment in 2015 was 4.7 per cent. This is an increase as compared with 2014, when 4.0 per cent stated that they had been exposed. Between 2005 and 2010, the percentage of exposed persons gradually declined from 5.2 per cent to 3.5 per cent. Thereafter, the percentage increased between 2011 and 2015 towards the same level as when the survey was commenced (when the percentage of exposed persons was 5.0%). Exposure to harassment is more common for women than men, and most common among the youngest in the survey (in the 16–19 age bracket). It is most common for the perpetrator to be unknown to the victim.\n\nThere might be a correlation between rise in harassment by an unknown perpetrator due to the general rise of harassment in various online communities, but nothing conclusive. Most harassment reported is either women harassing women or men harassing men, the smallest portion of reported cases are men harassing women.\n\nSanctions under the Swedish Penal Code consist of fines and damages, imprisonment, conditional sentences, probation, being placed in special care and community service. Various sanctions can be combined. A basic premise in the Penal Code is that non-custodial penalties are more desirable than custodial, and the court has considerable latitude when choosing a criminal sanctions, paying special attention to measures chiefly aimed at rehabilitating offenders.\n\nA person who has committed a crime may be ordered to pay damages to the victim. Such damages can relate to compensation for destroyed clothing, a broken tooth, costs for medical care, pain and suffering, or personal violation. A person sentenced for an offence that could lead to imprisonment must pay SEK 800 to the Crime Victim Fund. Fines are determined in money, or as day fines. In the case of day fines, two figures are given, for example \"40 day fines of SEK 50\" (i.e. SEK 2,000). The first figure shows how serious the court has considered the offence and the latter figure depends on financial situation of the accused.\n\nConditional sentences are primarily intended when a person commits a one-off crime and there is no reason to fear that he or she will re-offend. Probation can be applied to crimes for which fines are considered insufficient. Like a conditional sentence, it is non-custodial, but it is relatively intrusive.\n\nIf a conditional sentence is imposed there will be a probationary period of two years. During this period, the person must conduct himself in an acceptable manner. The conditional sentence may be combined with day fines and/or an obligation to perform community service. There is no check made as to whether the person sentenced has conducted himself in an acceptable manner; but if the person is found to conduct himself in an unacceptable manner, the court may issue a warning, change a provision, or decide that the conditional sentence should be replaced by another sanction.\n\nA person who has been sentenced to probation is subject to a probationary period of three years. During this period, the person must conduct himself in an acceptable manner. A probation officer is appointed, who will assist and support the person sentenced. The court may specify rules about medical care, work and housing during the probationary period. The probation may be combined with day fines, imprisonment, an obligation to undergo care according to a predetermined treatment plan and/or to perform community service.\n\nCommunity service is an obligation to perform certain unpaid work during a particular time. A person sentenced to community service serves his sentence through working, for example, for an association or a not-for-profit organisation.\n\nA person who has been sentenced to at most six months imprisonment has the opportunity to serve the sentence in the form of intensive supervision with electronic monitoring. The person sentenced will serve the penalty at home and may only leave home at certain times, for example, to go to work. Compliance with these times is checked electronically.\n\nA person who has been sentenced to prison will receive an order from the Swedish Prison and Probation Service to attend an institution. It is possible to start serving the penalty immediately after the judgement has been made, and in certain cases, the person sentenced can get a postponement up to one year. A sentence of imprisonment can, in certain cases, be enforced by the Prison and Probation Service with the use of an ankle monitor outside the institution.\n\nPrison sentences may not be less than 14 days and may not exceed ten years (18 years for some offences) or life imprisonment. A person sentenced to life imprisonment can apply for a determined sentence at the Örebro Lower Court. A prisoner has to serve at least 10 years in prison before applying and the set sentence cannot be under 18 years. However, some prisoners may never be released, being considered too dangerous.\n\nAccording to the penal code, persons under 15 who have committed a crime cannot be sentenced to any sanction. If the under age offender is in need of corrective measures due to the crime, it is the responsibility of the National Board of Health and Welfare to rectify the situation, either by ordering that he be put into care in a family home or a home with special supervision.\n\nAs a rule, offenders between 15 and 17 are subject to sanctions under the Act on Special Rules for the Care of the Young (SFS 1980:621) instead of normal criminal sanctions. An offender aged 15 and 17 years old, who have committed serious or repeated crimes, and is sentenced to prison or closed juvenile care usually serves time in a special youth home run by the National Board of Institutional Care. A person under 18 years is only sentenced to prison during exceptional circumstances. In less serious cases, fines are levied.\n\nFor offenders between 18 and 19 years of age, measures in accordance with the Act on Special Rules for the Care may only be used to a limited extent. A person over 18 but under 21 can be sentenced to prison only if there are special reasons for this, with regard to the crime, or for other special reasons. A person who is under 21 when a crime was committed may receive milder sentencing than that normally stipulated, and may never be sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThere are no age limits for the application of conditional sentences.\n\nSweden had an incarceration rate of 66 persons per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013, which is significantly lower than in most other countries. By comparison, the EU average incarceration rate in the period 2008–2010 was 126 persons per 100,000.\n\nIn 2012, approximately 12,000 prison terms were handed down — a level comparable to the one in the mid-1970s. The number of people sentenced to prison went down in the nine-year period of 2004–2013, but the average sentence length (approximately 8.4 months) has not been affected.\n\nThere has been debate in the media about the crime rate in Sweden, and further debate about how crime has been affected by the accumulated immigration and refugee influx. Some international media have claimed that the refuge immigrants in Sweden created dangerous neighborhoods that are now \"no-go zones\" for Swedish police. Several pieces by Norsk rikskringkasting, the state-run media channel in the neighbouring country Norway have described the \"no-go zones\" as areas in which ambulances, the fire brigade and police are routinely attacked, with reporter Anders Magnus in 2016 threatened and hurled rocks at by masked men when he tried to make interviews in Husby. Norwegian minister of immigration and integration Sylvi Listhaug and opposition politician Bård Vegard Solhjell said that they were \"shocked\" by the emergence of no-go zones in Sweden.\n\nAnother incidence of foreign journalists attacked in a Stockholm suburb includes the Australian team of Liz Hayes from CBS's \"60 minutes\" in Rinkeby in 2016, working with anti-immigration activist Jan Sjunnesson, in which a member of the crew was allegedly dragged into a building during filming and punched and kicked by several people. In 2017, independent investigative journalist Tim Pool was escorted out of Rinkeby by police, \"as many men were getting agitated by our presence\". However, Swedish police authorities claimed that Pool was not formally escorted out of the area, as no police report on the incident was filed. After his visit to Sweden, Pool concluded that Sweden \"has real problems\".\n\nWhile \"no-go zones\" do not exist in Sweden, an official report from the Swedish Police Authority published in December 2015 describes certain areas in Sweden where the police are having difficulties completing police tasks. They may be met with hostility and violence from crowds attacking police patrols by throwing stones at them and burning police cars, which at times force the police to postpone an intervention. This aggression is also directed at other official representatives of Swedish public institutions such as ambulance and fire brigade personnel. Fifteen specific areas are categorized as particularly critical areas (sv:\"Särskilt utsatta områden\") where incidents like these often take place.\n\nIn a February 2017 interview by US Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, filmmaker Ami Horowitz said migrants in Sweden have been associated with a crime wave, and “they often times try to cover up some of these crimes.” Henrik Selin, a political scientist and deputy director of the Swedish Institute, described these news reports of an immigrant-related crime surge as \"highly exaggerated and not based in facts.\" According to Martin Gelin of the Swedish newspaper \"Dagens Nyheter\", “countless right-wing media in the United States that have long been reporting that Sweden is heading for total collapse.”\nSwedish-Kurdish economist Tino Sanandaji said that due to fear of being perceived as racists, it has been taboo in Sweden to describe the situation in the affected areas.\n\nIn February 2017, UKIP British politician Nigel Farage defined the Swedish city of Malmö as the \"rape capital of Europe\", and linked the high number of rapes in Sweden to the immigrants and asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East; he was subsequently criticized by the BBC because, at the time, there were no data available on the ethnicity of the attackers. One year later, in August 2018 the BBC itself reported that rape statistics in Sweden show that 58% of men convicted of rape and attempted rape over the past five years were refugees and immigrants\n(Southern Africans, Northern Africans, Arabs, Middle Easterns, and Afghans); Swedish Television's investigating journalists found that in cases where the victims didn't know the attackers, the proportion of immigrant sex offenders was more than 80%. \n\nAlleged immigrant crime in Sweden made international news and what has been called a \"diplomatic incident\" in February 2017 when US president Donald Trump told a rally in Melbourne, Florida on 18 February 2017 that Sweden has \"\"problems that they never thought possible\" and \"You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden\" \" following his watching of Ami Horowitz's appearance on Tucker Carlson. According to the New York Times, Trump aides \"sought to clarify that Mr. Trump’s remarks were about a rising tide of crime in general\". He later tweeted that the \" ... media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was an important tool in the state-building of the USSR, provided the government with important ethnographic information, and helped in the transformation from Imperial Russian society to Soviet society. The decisions made by ethnographers in determining the ethnicity (\"narodnost\") of individuals, whether in the Asiatic or European parts of the former Russian Empire, through the drawing up of the \"List of Ethnicities of the USSR\", and how borders were drawn in mixed areas had a significant influence on Soviet policies. Ethnographers, statisticians, and linguists were drawing up questionnaires and list of ethnicities for the census. However, they also had the more ambitious goal of deliberately transforming their identities according to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. As Anastas Mikoyan put it, the Soviet Union was: \"creating and organising new nations\".\n\nThe First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union followed two partial censuses carried out by the Bolsheviks following their seizure of power in Russia. The first, the \"general census of 1920\", took place during the Civil War and the Soviet-Polish War. It was thus unable to deal with the Crimea, much of Transcaucasia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Far Eastern, Siberian, and Central Asian parts of the Soviet Union as well as with its Far Northern parts. Yet it is worth to note that there was only 15,000,000 population increase between 1920 and 1926 constituting in some 131,304,931 people according to the TIME magazine while is still undisclosed in Russian history. The \"1923 Census\" was restricted to cities. Prior to the Russian Revolution, the only Russian Empire Census was done in 1897.\n\nBy classifying the population in terms of \"narodnosti\" (nationalities)—as opposed to tribe or clan—along with policies which gave these nations land, resources, and rights, experts and local elites were encouraged to interfere with the information collecting.\n\nThis list, called \"Programmy i posobiya po razrabotke Vsesoyuznoy perepisi naseleniya 1926 goda\", vol. 7, \"Perechen i slovar narodnostey\", Moscow 1927, was developed by the Central Statistical Administration of the USSR.\n\n191.

{"id": "3043804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3043804", "title": "Garri", "text": "Garri\n\nThe word \"Garri\" originates from the Hausa Language in West Africa. It is used to describe any powdery material, especially foodstuff, such as flour grains, e.g., \"Garin Dawa\" (guinea corn flour), \"Garin masara\" (maize flour), and \"Garin sukkhari\" (sugar), and particularly fried tapioca. It can also be used for ground substances, as in \"Garin Magani\" (powdery medicine).\n\nTypes of flour foodstuffs mixed with water used to be a major part of the diet in the Hausa lands and almost all parts of Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon and Liberia for many centuries. They were used by travellers in particular, who were often unable to carry cooked meals. Traveling on horseback or donkeys and trekking took a very long time and so required readily-available fast food. For example, while now it might take 75 minutes to go to Zaria from Kano, 120 years ago it was a 5-day journey, and so one needed to take a large amount of garri.\n\nThe age of this ancient word in Hausa language can be realized by its occurrence in old proverbs and in the naming of towns and villages.\n\nTo make garri, cassava tubers are peeled, washed and grated or crushed to produce a mash. The mash could be mixed with palm oil (oil garri) before being placed in a porous bag. It is then placed in an adjustable press machine for 1–3 hours to remove excess starchy water. When the cassava has become dry enough, it is ready for the next step. It is then sieved and fried in a large clay frying pot with or without palm oil. The resulting dry granular garri can be stored for long periods. It may be pounded or ground to make a fine flour.\n\nEba is a stiff dough made by soaking garri in hot water and kneading it with a wooden baton until it becomes a smooth doughy staple, that is served as part of a meal with various soups and sauces. Some of these include okra soup, egusi soup, vegetable soup, afang soup, banga soup and bitter leaf soup among others.\n\nKokoro is a common snack food in Nigeria, especially in southern and southeast Nigeria, especially Abia state, Rivers state, Anambra state, Enugu state and Imo state. It is made from a paste of maize flour, mixed with garri and sugar and deep-fried.\n\nGarri comes in various consistencies, which can roughly be categorized into rough, medium and smooth. Each type is used for a particular food.\n\nAs a snack, Cereal, or light meal, garri can be soaked in cold water (in which case it settles to the bottom), mixed with sugar or honey, and sometimes roasted. Peanuts or groundnut with/or evaporated milk are sometimes added. The amount of water needed for soaked garri is 3:1. Garri can also be eaten dry without water, but with sugar and roasted peanut added.\n\nIn its dry form, garri is used as an accompaniment for soft cooked beans and palm oil. This food mix is called \"yoo ke garri\" or \"Foto gari\" in the Ga language, in Ghana. Foto gari is the combination of moistened garri and stew, while yoo ke garri is garri with beans, a combination which is typically eaten as lunch. It is also eaten with beans cake in Nigeria.\n\nFor a full meal, garri is usually cooked by adding it to hot water, then kneading it into dough. This is eaten with different types of thick, leafy vegetable stews, melon seed stews, peanut stews, or beans.\n\nSmooth garri (known as lebu to the Yoruba) can be mixed with pepper and other spicy ingredients. A small amount of warm water and palm oil is added and mixed with the hand to soften up. This type of garri is served with fried fish. It is also served with frejon on Good Friday.\n\nIn West Africa, there are two types, white and yellow garri. Yellow garri is prepared by frying with the addition of palm oil to give it a yellow colour; white garri is fried without palm oil.\n\nMany variations of yellow and white garri are common across Nigeria. One variation of white garri is popularly known as garri-Ijebu. This is produced mainly by the Yoruba people of Ijebu origin.\n\nIn Ghana, garri is judged by its taste and grain size. The sweeter types with finer grains are more valued over sourer, large grain varieties. Commercial food vendors on the other hand prefer coarser grains with high starch content, as this yields more quantity when soaked in water.\n\nBuyers often look out for crispier grains when trying to determine freshness.\n\nGarri can be eaten without further cooking, as a snack, by placing it in a bowl adding cold water, sugar, groundnut and milk usually called garri soakings. For example, ijebu-garri is made with finer grains, and has a pleasantly sour taste, making it very suitable to be eaten in this way. In most parts of West African, sugar or honey is then added as well as chunks of coconut, groundnuts, tiger nuts milk, and cashew nuts.\n\nIn most garri recipes it is cooked by adding boiling water and stirring to make a stiff paste or porridge. Eba is normally eaten with different kinds of soups or stews. Most parts of Africa have an equivalent staple cassava dish. \n\nIn Liberia, Garri is used to make a dessert called Kanyan which is combined with peanuts and honey.\n\nCassava, the root from which garri is produced, is rich in fiber, copper and magnesium.\n\nGarri is made from cassava which contains hydrocyanic acid (cyanide), which, in sufficient quantity, can lead to serious eye defects, intestinal issues and worsening of ulcers. Proper and thorough processing of the Garri should reduce the concentration of the acid. Cassava must be fermented for 7 days to prevent it from being a poisonous food.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46466082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46466082", "title": "Gender equality in New Zealand", "text": "Gender equality in New Zealand\n\nGender equality is the notion that all men and women should receive equal treatment in all aspects and that one should not be discriminated based on their sex. Gender equality is a human right and this is recognised by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The right to be free of discrimination on the grounds of sex is found pursuant to Article 2 of the declaration.\n\nGender equality is increasingly framed as being central to the realisation of both modernisation and economic efficiency, and its achievement presented as a key to good governance. As a result, the New Zealand government has implemented institutional mechanisms to promote the advancement of women and gender equality. In 2016, New Zealand was ranked 9th out of a total of 144 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report which ranks countries in terms of women's gender equality in the population under four heads: economic participation, health, education and political empowerment.\n\nAlbeit, New Zealand has committed to support the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and other key United Nations organisations in agreeing to uphold the UDHR. It has participated in human rights deliberations at the United Nations General Assembly and in the annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR) and proposes to support the rights of women, children and indigenous people.\n\nFurther, New Zealand ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) on 10 January 1985, and its optional protocol on 7 September 2000. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs is responsible for administrating the CEDAW and its Optional Protocol. The committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women makes recommendations on any issues affecting women that the state should address. As of April 2015 the committee has made 29 general recommendations on issues affecting women that states should devote more attention to.\n\nIn the World Economic Forum’s annual report on the global gender gap, New Zealand was ranked in 9th place in 2016. The Global Gender Gap Index ranks countries on how far women are behind men in regards to health, education and economic and political indicators. Instances where women are rated ahead of men are not counted as inequality.\n\nNew Zealand is party to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In the OECD’s final report on Gender Equality in Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship it was found that women in New Zealand do more unpaid work than paid work, gain more tertiary qualifications than men and women-owned new enterprises outperform men-owned enterprises.\n\nNonetheless, despite the gap between wage equality slowly closing in, the report found that the government funding allocated to reduce gender inequality in New Zealand is on the low side in comparison to other countries in the OECD.\n\nThroughout history, gender inequality has generally affected women more so than men. As a result, there has been a lot of controversy in respect of the matter and activism since the 19th century.\n\nNew Zealand has had a long history of promoting women’s equality. It was the first nation in the world to give women the right to vote in the 19th century. Previously, women were unable to vote until 1893 and were not able to stand for parliament until 1919. The first woman to win an election was Elizabeth McCombs in 1933. Iriaka Ratana was the first Maori woman MP in 1949 and Dame Jenny Shipley was the first woman to be prime minister in New Zealand from 1997 to 1999.\n\nHistorical inequalities for men include prohibition of homosexuality for men until the homosexual law reform bill in 1986 and military conscription.\n\nThe legal framework in New Zealand provides comprehensive protection against all forms of discrimination covered by the CEDAW.\n\nIn 1973 The Domestic Purpose Benefit (now the sole parent or jobseeker support) was introduced for all parents caring for dependent children without the support of a partner (mainly women). The Accident Compensation Amendment Act 2010 also extended compensation to non-earners, benefiting women who do full-time unpaid work in the domestic home.\n\nNew Zealand has also enacted a number of legislative means to provide for equal pay for women, outlawing sexual discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace and proposes to set out rights in regards to equal employment for career progression in the workplace.\n\nLegislation in respect of gender equality in the workplace include the Equal Pay Act 1972, the State Sector Act 1988 and the Human Rights Act 1993. \nThe New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 protects all New Zealand citizens from discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nNew Zealand still has some old laws which have not been repealed or replaced.\n\nAbortion is still listed under the Crimes Act 1961. Two certifying consultants (doctors) must agree that continuing the pregnancy would result in serious danger to a woman’s mental or physical health in order for women to access abortion. Rape is not a grounds in itself for abortion in New Zealand.\n\nSection 194 of the Crimes Act ‘assault on a child, or by a male on a female’ sets the maximum penalty for a male assaulting a female at two years and is not cover by the less restrictive 'bail as of right' provisions. The equivalent charge of common assault has a maximum one year penalty and is covered by 'bail as of right' provisions.\n\nThe Law Commission reviewed the Crimes Act in 2009 and recommended a repeal of this law and suggested that the maximum penalty for common assault be increased so that the more serious cases can still be dealt with appropriately.\n\nThe proposed Family and Gandu Violence Legislation Bill seeks to address the limitations of using ‘male assaults female’ as a mechanism to address domestic violence, however Amy Adams explicitly recommended keeping 'male assaults female'.\n\nThere are some other laws refer to ‘male assaults female’ which creates further gender inequalities. The Accident Compensation Act 2001 allows victims of certain crimes the ability to make claims for compensation for mental injury. Male assault female is one of those crimes. The Criminal Investigations (Bodily Samples) Act 1995 allows investigators the ability to take bodily samples from people accused of certain crimes. The gender neutral equivalent, common assault, is not included in those acts.\n\nA woman can be charged with the lesser crime of infanticide if she kills her child and \"the balance of her mind was disturbed\". There is no equivalent for men. In New Zealand, there is at least one case of a man being charged with murder where if he was a woman he would have been charged with infanticide.\n\n\"Otago University law professor Kevin Dawkins ... said he would like to see infanticide replaced with another partial defence of diminished responsibility, to apply to female and male offenders.\"\n\nThe Adoption Act 1955 prevents males from adopting female children in certain cases.\n\nNew Zealand has mechanism to prevent gender inequality in proposed legislation. Section 7 of the Bill of Right Act requires the Attorney General to report to Parliament if a bill appears to be inconsistent with the non-discrimination requirements of the act. However parliament is not bound by these reports.\n\nPapers presented to cabinet are required to undergo a gender analysis by the Ministry for Women to determine the potential impacts on women and girls.\n\nIn the past century the gender gap in New Zealand has been slowly closing in and there has been an increase in women’s rights and feminism. The government is making steady progress and it is evident that the fundamentals for equal rights are all in place: democracy, the rule of law and an independent judiciary. The government has also implemented effective structures of governance, specialized human rights and other accountability mechanisms, and has recognised the vulnerability of particular groups and individuals.\n\nAlthough New Zealand consistently ranks in the top half dozen of countries in the world when it comes to equality between men and women, it is not complacent in terms of gender equality. New Zealand women still do not experience the full equality guaranteed by the law. Across the economy women’s skills are under-used in leadership and women continue to earn less than men – even if they have the same qualifications, and similar job descriptions. Family violence also continues to be a cause of considerable disquiet.\n\nHowever, many of the remaining gender gaps in New Zealand do not appear to be a conscious disregard to the law (as there is comprehensive legislation in place), rather it is largely based on subconscious prejudice and factors like occupational segregation.\n\nNew Zealand has had a high level of participation by women in public life and this is evident from the modest female representation in politics and the judiciary. However, women continue to be under represented in parliament. Currently, there is a 31% female representation in parliament.\n\nAt present there are no adopted quotas and targets to increase the number of women to ensure the equal representation of women in all publicly appointed bodies by the New Zealand Government. Rather, the government has developed a policy of ‘soft targets’ to promote equal representation. This was criticized by the Human Rights Commission as being insufficient as there is no dedicated machinery to guide it.\n\nThe government’s current goals and priorities in terms of employment equality for New Zealand women are linked to its broader goal of improving New Zealand’s prosperity in the economy. This is to allow women to have more choices and opportunities to use their strengths to maximize social and economical success.\n\nThe New Zealand workforce shows a pattern of occupational segregation. For example, women tend to work in lower paying jobs, which contributes, in part, to the wage gap. Dangerous jobs are tend to be mainly male occupations, leading to significantly more workplace injuries and deaths among men.\n\nWith regard to pay equity, the domestic gender pay gap in New Zealand when comparing full-time workers is rather low in comparison to other countries. The gender pay gap in New Zealand was calculated to be 9.9% in 2014, which was the lowest in the Asia Pacific Region.\n\nIn terms of New Zealand labour force participation, the female unemployment rate is statistically higher than that of men (with the unemployment rate being the highest for Māori and Pacific women). Women generally have higher rates of participation in all categories of unpaid work – within and outside of the household. The amount of part time workers in New Zealand are three quarters women. Various demographics of women take on more part time work than men.\n\nSection 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 prohibits discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sex (including pregnancy and child birth), marital status and family status.\n\nGender equality is a topic in the workforce that has received increasing discussion and momentum. New Zealand started as the first nation to have full voting rights for women in 1893. From there, women entered the workforce in the 1960s, although the participation rate of men and women at the time was 81 percent and 67 percent respectively. The report from the New Zealand Census of Women’s participation in Government and Professional Life shows 60 percent of women have no position of the top 100 corporations. Approximately 63 percent of women’s work in New Zealand is unpaid, compared to 35 percent of men’s work. The goals of the New Zealand policy is to achieve women’s representation in these organizations. Along with this, large corporations are encouraged to meet with the Ministry for Women. New Zealand has utilized ways to further improve gender equality, by creating gender analysis tools so that various aspects can be further developed.\n\nFeminists in New Zealand have developed their goal of creating greater equality for women. Equal economic agenda is a pillar of the liberal feminist ideas stemming from the 1980s. The aim of these organizations is to create greater economic independence for women. The goal of these programs is to increase representation for women and help them gain further recognition in the economic sector. \n\nThe development of different policies towards greater equality in the workforce is championed by the various women's organizations in New Zealand. The Women's Affairs is recognized on a national level in the country.\n\nThe Ministry also created interactive relationships with different female organizations. The workforce has benefited from the government interaction with women's organizations and helped to understand the change in the various female demographics in the economic sector. The commitment of the government to provide an equal working field is an important aspect of equality for women in New Zealand. There is a National Action Plan to implement UNSC Resolution 1325, which is dedicated to Peace and Security for women.\n\nGenerally, in education, women tend to outperform men and women tend to fare better in participation.\n\nIn years 1-8 fewer boys than girls are meeting national standards according to 2015 figures.\n\nFewer boys stay in school until 17, 81.4% compared to 86.5% (5.1 percentage points difference) \n\nWomen are 60% of those who gain tertiary certificates and diplomas. Women also earn 60% of Bachelor degrees and above. 54.1% of STEM graduates are women, however women only make up 22.9% of engineering graduates, 27.9% of IT graduates, and only 11.1% of apprenticeships.\n\nWomen outnumber men for 15 to 24-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training (NEET). In 2016 12.9% of women were NEET, compared to 10.1% of men.\n\nThe Administration Act 1976 (section 77) provides for equal inheritance rights for sons and daughters and there is no evidence of discrimination in practice, or under any informal customary systems.\n\nNew Zealand women have the right to non-discrimination in the ownership and access to land. The Maori Land Act 1993 provides for gender equality in the control and use of land and resources. In terms of non-land assets, there are no restrictions on their equal rights to property, regardless of marital status.\n\nWomen also have the equal right to financial services pursuant to the Human Rights 1993.\n\nWomen can access the same comprehensive range of health services as men, as well as having a range of services in place specifically designed for women’s health needs – such as maternity services and population screening programmes.\n\nOn average, women have better health outcomes than men and women generally have a higher life expectancy. However, there are areas in which New Zealand does not fare so well in terms of health. New Zealand has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the OECD with the Māori teen pregnancy rate being rather high.\n\nFor the 2016/17 year there were 457 male suicides and 149 female suicides. The suicide rate per 100,000 population was 19.36 for males and 6.12. Traditionally the ratio is about 3:1 male to female.\n\nThe New Zealand life expectancy at birth for babies born between 2012 and 2014 was 79.5 years for males and 83.2 years for females, which is a difference of 3.7 years.\n\nA male New Zealander born in 2013 can expect to live for an average of 65.2 years independently, and another 14.3 years with some level of disability requiring support.\n\nFemales can expect to live for an average of 66.5 years independently and another 16.7 years with functional limitations that require support.\n\nAt birth, therefore, females can expect to live independently for 1.3 years longer than males. They can also expect to live 2.4 years longer with disability requiring assistance than males\n\nThe Domestic Violence Act 1995 addresses domestic and family violence against women and pursuant to the act domestic violence can be charged as a criminal offence.\n\nIn New Zealand the government has implemented specialist family violence courts and means-tested legal aid services which provide referral and advocacy as well as applicant support and outreach for victims of domestic violence. The New Zealand government has made steady progress in implementing fundamental criminal justice reforms that strengthen victim’s rights and aims to provide greater protection for those at threat of family violence – most of whom are women victims of male violence.\n\nThe social attitudes in New Zealand currently remain an impediment to combatting domestic violence and as such, is one of the major barriers in achieving gender equity in New Zealand. In essence the relatively strong legal framework is not always effectively implemented and domestic violence continues to be a challenge for New Zealand society. It is estimated that only 18% of family violence cases are reported to the police and 84% of those arrested for domestic violence are men.\n\nHowever the attitudes towards family violence in New Zealand are in the midst of change as a result of a sustained national campaign - The Campaign for Action on Violence within Families, which aims at changing social attitudes towards family violence. The government has also implemented similar programmes designed specifically for Maori, Pacific and migrant women which are endorsed by their communities.\n\nRates of partner and sexual violence against women had a statistically significant redcution from 2005 to 2013. \"The annual rate of partner violence offences against women decreased from 8.6 percent in 2005 to 5.7 percent in 2013. The annual rate of sexual violence offences against women decreased from 5.2 percent in 2005 to 2.9 percent in 2013.\"\n\nThe latest New Zealand Crime and Safety Survey found that 4.4% of males and 5.7% of females reported one or more incidents of partner violence in the 12 months preceding the survey.\n\n\n"}

In 1991, Navarro worked as a legal extern for United States District Judge Philip Martin Pro.\n\nIn 1993, Navarro worked part-time as a mitigation investigator for a Las Vegas law firm and as a contract law clerk for several organizations. From 1994 until 1996, Navarro worked as an associate attorney for a Las Vegas law firm, and she then worked as a sole practitioner in Las Vegas from 1996 until 2001. From 2001 until 2004, Navarro served as a Deputy Special Public Defender for Clark County, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, she served as a Chief Deputy District Attorney for the Civil Division in the Clark County District Attorney's office.\n\nOn September 11, 2009, Sen. Harry Reid contacted Navarro to inquire about her interest in serving on the federal bench.

However most of these immigrants eventually assimilated into the diverse groups that trace their heritage from this polity such as Poles, Lithuanians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians.\n\nMost self-identified Greeks in Poland today trace their heritage to the large number of Greek citizens who fled as refugees from the Greek Civil War and were admitted into Poland.\n\nMost had been farmers before their flight from Greece. In total, from 1949 to 1951, 12,300 people from Greece came to Poland, of whom roughly one-quarter were children.\n\nMost refugees arrived by sea through the port at Gdynia. The Polish government chose to settle them in the territories west of the Oder River near the border with East Germany, especially near Zgorzelec. About 200 were also sent to Krościenko in the southeast, near the Bieszczady Mountains in a formerly ethnic Ukrainian area. Initially, the refugees were celebrated as anti-capitalist heroes and given significant government assistance in building new lives and integrating in Poland. Initially, they found employment on farms, for which they were well suited because of their rural background; however, they later gravitated towards urban areas.\n\nSome refugees chose to return to Greece early on. By 1957, still roughly 10,000 remained in Poland. However, suspicions later fell on them of being Titoist agents. A large number were deported to Bulgaria in 1961.\nAfter a 1985 agreement between the governments of Poland and Greece that enabled Greek refugees to receive retirement pensions at home, the number of Greeks in Poland has deteriorated further.\n\nThe refugees belonged to different ethnicities, including half reportedly of Macedonian ethnicity and speaking the Macedonian language. Two Polish experts in Minority Studies, Alfred F. Majewicz and Tomasz Wicherkiewicz, claim that the Polish government cooperated with Greek refugees in forcing Macedonian refugees to adopt Hellenic names, and prevented them from opening their own schools and organisations.\n\nIn 1950 the refugees from Greece were organized in the Community of Political Refugees from Greece (), based in Zgorzelec. Two years later it moved to Wroclaw and was renamed in 1953 Nikos Beloyannis Union of Political Refugees from Greece (). After the fall of the dictatorship in Greece it changed its name into Association of Greeks in Poland (), but in 1989, an internal schism led to the creation of the Association of Macedonians in Poland ().\n\nIn his essay, published by the \"Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights\", professor Slawomir Lodzinski states:\n\nAt present, the full legal protection is limited to this national minorities which are groups of Polish citizens, are “old”, “native” and on non-immigrant origin. This perspective has caused that the groups of Greeks and Macedonians who have been recognized as national minorities from the 1950s, from the beginning of the 1990s are not treated as national minorities by the state.\nAnswering a question by Brunon Synak, President of the Kashubian-Pomeranian Association, at a meeting organized by the Council of Europe in 2002, Mr. Dobiesław Rzemieniewski, Head of the National Minorities Division in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration, explained that Greeks and Macedonians are \"not classified as national minorities since they do not meet the requirement of being traditionally domiciled on the territory of the Republic of Poland\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "220255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220255", "title": "Hypersexuality", "text": "Hypersexuality\n\nHypersexuality is a clinical diagnosis used by mental healthcare professionals for extremely frequent or suddenly increased libido. Nymphomania and satyriasis were terms previously used for the condition, in women and men respectively.\n\nHypersexuality may be a primary condition, or the symptom of another medical disease or condition, for example Klüver-Bucy syndrome or bipolar disorder. Hypersexuality may also present as a side effect of medication such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, or through the administering of hormones such as testosterone and estrogen during hormone therapy.\nClinicians have yet to reach a consensus over how best to describe hypersexuality as a primary condition, or to determine the appropriateness of describing such behaviors and impulses as a separate pathology.\n\nHypersexual behaviours are viewed variously by clinicians and therapists as a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or \"OCD-spectrum disorder\", an addiction, or a disorder of impulsivity. A number of authors do not acknowledge such a pathology and instead assert that the condition merely reflects a cultural dislike of exceptional sexual behavior.\n\nConsistent with there not being any consensus over what causes hypersexuality, authors have used many different labels to refer to it, sometimes interchangeably, but often depending on which theory they favor or which specific behavior they were studying. Contemporary names include compulsive masturbation, compulsive sexual behavior, cybersex addiction, erotomania, \"excessive sexual drive\", hyperphilia, hypersexuality, hypersexual disorder, problematic hypersexuality, sexual addiction, sexual compulsivity, sexual dependency, sexual impulsivity, \"out of control sexual behavior\", and paraphilia-related disorder.\n\nThe \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" defines \"hypersexual\" as \"exhibiting unusual or excessive concern with or indulgence in sexual activity\". Sexologists have been using the term \"hypersexuality\" since the late 1800s, when Krafft-Ebing described several cases of extreme sexual behaviours in his seminal 1886 book, \"Psychopathia Sexualis.\" The author used the term \"hypersexuality\" to describe conditions that would now be termed premature ejaculation. Terms to describe males with the condition include \"donjuanist\", \"satyromaniac\",\"satyriac\" and \"satyriasist\", for women \"clitoromaniac\", \"nympho\" and \"nymphomaniac\", for teleiophilic heterosexual women \"andromaniac\", while \"hypersexualist\", \"sexaholic\", \"onanist\", \"hyperphiliac\" and \"erotomaniac\" are gender neutral terms.\n\nOther, mostly historical, names include Don Juanism, the Messalina complex, sexaholism hyperlibido and furor uterinus.\n\nThere is little consensus among experts as to the causes of hypersexuality. Some research suggests that some cases can be linked to biochemical or physiological changes that accompany dementia. Psychological needs also complicate the biological explanation, which identifies the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain as the area for regulating libido. Persons suffering from injuries to this part of the brain are at increased risk for aggressive behavior and other behavioral problems including personality changes and socially inappropriate sexual behavior such as hypersexuality. The same symptom can occur after unilateral temporal lobotomy. There are other biological factors that are associated with hypersexuality such as premenstrual changes, and the exposure to virilising hormones in childhood or in utero.\n\nIn research involving use of antiandrogens to reduce undesirable sexual behaviour such as hypersexuality, testosterone has been found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for sexual drive. Other proposed factors include a lack of physical closeness, and forgetfulness of the recent past.\n\nPathogenic overactivity of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway in the brain—forming either psychiatrically, during mania, or pharmacologically, as a side effect of dopamine agonists, specifically D-preferring agonists—is associated with various addictions and has been shown to result among some in overindulgent, sometimes hypersexual, behavior.\n\nThe American Association for Sex Addiction Therapy acknowledges biological factors as contributing causes of sex addiction. Other associated factors include psychological components (which affect mood and motivation as well as psychomotoric and cognitive functions), spiritual control, mood disorders, sexual trauma, and intimacy anorexia as causes or type of sex addiction.\n\nHypersexuality is known to present itself as a symptom in connection to a number of mental and neurological disorders. Some people with borderline personality disorder (sometimes referred to as BPD) can be markedly impulsive, seductive, and extremely sexual. Sexual promiscuity, sexual obsessions, and hypersexuality are very common symptoms for both men and women with BPD. On occasion for some there can be extreme forms of paraphilic drives and desires. \"Borderline\" patients, due in the opinion of some to the use of splitting, experience love and sexuality in unstable ways.\n\nPeople with bipolar disorder may often display tremendous swings in sex drive depending on their mood. As defined in the DSM-IV-TR, hypersexuality can be a symptom of hypomania or mania in bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. Pick's disease causes damage to the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain; people with Pick's disease show a range of socially inappropriate behaviors.\n\nSeveral neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, autism, various types of brain injury, Klüver–Bucy syndrome, Kleine–Levin syndrome, and many more neurodegenerative diseases can cause hypersexual behavior. Sexually inappropriate behavior has been shown to occur in 7-8% of Alzheimer's patients living at home, at a care facility or in a hospital setting. Hypersexuality has also been reported to result as a side-effect of some medications used to treat Parkinson's disease. Some street drugs, such as methamphetamine, may also contribute to hypersexual behavior.\n\nA positive link between the severity of dementia and occurrence of inappropriate behavior has also been found. Hypersexuality can be caused by dementia in a number of ways, including disinhibition due to organic disease, misreading of social cues, understimulation, the persistence of learned sexual behaviour after other behaviours have been lost, and the side-effects of the drugs used to treat dementia. Other possible causes of dementia-related hypersexuality include an inappropriately expressed psychological need for intimacy and forgetfulness of the recent past. As this illness progresses, increasing hypersexuality has been theorized to sometimes compensate for declining self-esteem and cognitive function.\n\nSymptoms of hypersexuality are also similar to those of sexual addiction in that they embody similar traits. These symptoms include the inability to be intimate (intimacy anorexia), depression and bipolar disorders. The resulting hypersexuality may have an impact in the person's social and occupational domains if the underlying symptoms have a large enough systemic influence.\n\n, a proposal to add \"Sexual Addiction\" to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) system has failed to get support of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The DSM does include an entry called Sexual Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Sexual Disorder NOS) to apply to, among other conditions, \"distress about a pattern of repeated sexual relationships involving a succession of lovers who are experienced by the individual only as things to be used\".\n\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization (WHO), includes two relevant entries. One is \"Excessive Sexual Drive\" (coded F52.7), which is divided into satyriasis for males and nymphomania for females. The other is \"Excessive Masturbation\" or \"Onanism (excessive)\" (coded F98.8).\n\nSome authors have questioned whether it makes sense to discuss hypersexuality at all, arguing that labeling sexual urges \"extreme\" merely stigmatizes people who do not conform to the norms of their culture or peer group.\n\nThe ICD-11 has created a new condition classification, compulsive sexual behavior, to cover \" a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour\".\nHypersexuality may negatively impact an individual. The concept of hypersexuality as an addiction was started in the 1970s by former members of Alcoholics Anonymous who felt they experienced a similar lack of control and compulsivity with sexual behaviors as with alcohol. Multiple 12-step style self-help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including Sex Addicts Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous. Some hypersexuals may treat their condition with the usage of medication (such as Cyproterone acetate) or any foods considered to be anaphrodisiacs. Other hypersexuals may choose a route of consultation, such as psychotherapy, self-help groups or counselling.\n\n"}

Specifically, conceptual modelers (1) describe structure models in terms of entities, relationships, and constraints; (2) describe behavior or functional models in terms of states, transitions among states, and actions performed in states and transitions; and (3) describe interactions and user interfaces in terms of messages sent and received and information exchanged. In their typical usage, conceptual-model diagrams are high-level abstractions that enable clients and analysts to understand one another, enable analysts to communicate successfully with application programmers, and in some cases automatically generate (parts of) the software application.\n\n\nPeter P.

The Iraqi Scouts Initiative committee was led by Co-Chairmen Beck and Michael Bradle, an Eagle Scout.\n\nIn early 2008, a group of coalition military officers led by Navy chaplain Lieutenant Commander Andrew Wade sought to expand the Green Zone Council's model to the Iraqis living in and around the Victory Base Complex around Baghdad International Airport. Meeting with the Green Zone Council and their Iraqi counterparts, and spending several months building relationships with Iraqi civilian and military leaders on and around Victory Base, the group founded the Victory Base Council in April 2008 and began supporting troop meetings in June 2008. Following the \"Green Zone\" model, the VBC is a loosely organized fraternal support group that enables their Iraqi partners to establish and grow a vibrant Scouting organization to serve local Iraqi youth. During 2008 the VBC built important relationships with local schools and worked with local Iraqi military and civilians to create a camp and community center where the troop meetings are held. Continued growth of the camp facilities, and ongoing cross training of US and Iraqi Scout leaders are underway for 2009.\n\nSince the movement restarted in 2004, it has been taken over by Iraqis and is now run exclusively by them. Iraqi Scouts are involved in community service such as helping police with traffic control, giving first aid, cultivating cotton, planting trees and helping during natural disasters.\n\nIn February 2006, 18 Iraqi Guides attended a leadership seminar in Egypt organized by the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. The association is currently listed as \"working toward membership\".\n\nThe Scout Motto is \"Kun Musta'idan\" or كن مستعداً, translating as \"Be Prepared\" in Arabic. The noun for a single Scout is \"Kashaf\" or كشاف in Arabic.\n\n"}

Although this initiative failed, it was followed by greater immigration from 1900 to the beginning of World War II, although it never reached the levels of Japanese immigration to countries like the United States, Brazil or Peru. Immigration halted during World War II and many Japanese nationals and even some naturalized Mexicans citizens of Japanese origin were forced to relocate from communities in Baja California, Sinaloa and Chiapas to Mexico City and other areas in the interior until the war was over. After the war, immigration began again, mostly due to Japanese companies investing in Mexico and sending over skilled employees. Currently, there are an estimated 30,000 people who are Japanese or of Japanese descent in Mexico including a recent migration of young Japanese artists into the country who have found more opportunity there than in their home country. It is the fourth largest Japanese community in Latin America.\n\nJapanese were among the Asian slaves who were shipped from the Spanish Philippines in the Manila-Acapulco galleons to Acapulco. These slaves were all called \"Chino\", which meant Chinese. In reality, they were of diverse origins, including Japanese, Koreans, Malays, Filipinos, Javanese, Timorese, and people from Bengal, India, Ceylon, Makassar, Tidore, Terenate, and China. Filipinos made up most of their population. The people in this community of diverse Asians in Mexico was called \"los indios chinos\" by the Spanish. Most of these slaves were male and were obtained from Portuguese slave traders who obtained them from Portuguese colonial possessions and outposts of the Estado da India, which included parts of India, Bengal, Malacca, Indonesia, Nagasaki in Japan, and Macau. Spain received some of these Chino slaves from Mexico, where owning a Chino slave showed high status. Records of three Japanese slaves dating from the 16th century, named Gaspar Fernandes, Miguel and Ventura who ended up in Mexico showed that they were purchased by Portuguese slave traders in Japan, brought to Manila from where they were shipped to Mexico by their owner Perez. Some of these Asian slaves were also brought to Lima in Peru, where there was a small community of Asians made out of Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Malays, and others.\nThe history of modern Japanese migration begins near the end of the 19th century. In 1868, Japanese isolation from the world was broken which prompted large scale social and economic upheaval, with the Japanese government encouraging emigration . These emigrants included those from Okinawa, who fled oppression by the Japanese government after the island was taken over in 1878.\n\nMexico was the first country to recognize Japanese sovereignty after the end of its isolation, signing a treaty with it in 1888 to allow citizens of both countries the ability to travel to the other and establishing consulates. Mexico was the first Latin American country to receive Japanese immigrants in 1897, with the first thirty five arriving to Chiapas under the auspices of Viscount Enomoto Takeaki, with the permission of Mexican president Porfirio Díaz . These first Japanese communities mostly consisted of farm workers and other laborers. Japanese authorities were interested in creating a coffee plantation in Chiapas, for export to Japan. They established the Sociedad Colonizadora Japón-México to recruit Japanese farmers to migrate with government support to obtain land. Others went without government assistance and were called “free emigrants” able to buy land without obligation to the Japanese government. However, economic conditions in Chiapas forced many immigrants to abandon their contracts with the Japanese government and instead formed a new organization called the Sociedad Cooperativa Nichiboku Kyodo Gaisha which allowed them to diversify their economic activities. The very first settlement was based on coffee production but failed for various reasons including the fact that not all of the colonists were farmers and many became sick with tropical diseases. Many from this colony dispersed but there remains a small Japanese community in Acacoyagua, Chiapas . However, its establishment marks the first Japanese immigration to Latin America.\n\nMost of the immigration to Mexico occurred from 1900 to the beginning of World War II. Many of the immigrants in the first half of the 20th century were skilled laborers or illegal immigrants. Mexico Japan relations were superficial in the latter 19th to mid 20th century but immigrants to Mexico had favorable treatment, as Mexico needed additional workers for modernization efforts.\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, a large number of Japanese immigrants came as workers contracted to companies doing business in the country which needed skilled labor. This was first in the mining and sugar cane industries and later in construction and railroads. The main Japanese companies involved in this were Kumamoto, Toyo and Tairiku Shokumin Kaisha which did business in mining and agriculture. The three companies sent a total of 530 people to Mexico between 1904 and 1907. However, many of the immigrants could not do the hard labor of the mines and sugar cane fields, prompting them to abandon their contracts, heading to California or even Cuba . During this time period, the number of people of Japanese background went down in Mexico.\n\nIn 1908, Japan and Mexico informally agreed to end immigration by contract, but “free” immigrants continued to come. From 1914 to 1938, another 291 people immigrated to Mexico from Japan. Legal skilled laborers after 1917 often worked in the health fields, along with those Japanese invited by the Japanese community in Mexico. Most of these were in Baja California where the economic development was greatest. A number of other Japanese came to the country illegally from the United States, after being rejected by this country, coming to Mexico hoping to enter the U.S. again. These were mostly concentrated in the north of Mexico and those who could not re-enter the United States stayed in Mexico permanently.\n\nSignificant Japanese immigration into the Ensenada, Baja California area took place between 1920 and 1940 with only two known Japanese residents before that. Ensenada, Rosarito and Mexicali attracted Japanese immigrants, legal and illegal. The number of Japanese by 1940 was about 300, most of whom worked in farming and fishing. Japanese fishing enterprises included the capture of lobster and mollusks. A significant portion of Japanese agricultural production was exported to the United States and even led to a Japanese-owned chili pepper dehydration facility for the same purpose.\n\nBefore WWII, the highest concentrations of Japanese and Japanese descent were in Baja California, followed by Mexico City and Sonora. Most worked in fishing and agriculture followed by non-professional workers, commerce, professionals and technicians. Up until the war, the treatment of Japanese in the country and their descendents had been favorable, very different than the treatment of Chinese in the country, which suffered discrimination and even expulsion in the early 20th century. The Japanese were relatively free from discrimination in Mexico, unlike the United States, Brazil and other countries in the Americas. One reason for this is that the Japanese population was not as prominent as the Chinese one in numbers and the work that they did, which included the construction of factories, bridges and other infrastructure was viewed favorably. The Japanese were not considered to be foreign exploiters, rather partners in Mexico’s development because of their technical skills in fields such as medicine and engineering.\n\nIn Chiapas where the earliest Japanese immigration occurred in the prior century, intermarriage was common, breaking down ethnic barriers. This has led to the end of a distinct Japanese population in the state, leaving only family names as a reminder. The official census of 1940s counts only 1,550 Japanese nationals in the country, the overwhelming majority men, although other studies put the number higher, as many as over 6,000. Even with the 6,000 figure, it pales against the number of Japanese in other countries in the Americas at the time such as the United States (285,000), Brazil (205,000), Canada (22,000) and Peru (18,000) .\nJapanese immigration halted by World War II to near zero, and those who were in the country were faced with restrictions and relocation after Mexico broke diplomatic ties with Japan in 1941. Japanese national and even those with naturalized Mexican citizenship were forced to move from areas along the Pacific coast such as Baja California, Sinaloa and Chiapas inland, with some forced into exile to Japan. The goal was to keep the Japanese in Mexico away from ports and from Mexico’s border with the United States so that they could not be used as a “fifth column” by the Japanese government.\n\nJapanese nationals were forced to move to interior cities such as Puebla, Guadalajara and Cuernavaca. Most went to Mexico City and Guadalajara but there were concentrations in Guanajuato and Querétaro. It is estimated that about 1,100 people moved to Mexico City and Guadalajara alone. The Japanese community worked to buy properties to house the displaced including the former Temixco Hacienda near Cuernavaca which allowed the Japanese there to grow crops and live semi-independently. The fear of Japanese-Mexicans faded during the war, with some allowed to go back home before 1945 and the rest after.\n\nMexico was one of a number of countries to take this action, but in the end only about 3,500 people were affected as opposed to 120,000 in the United States. With some exceptions, those forcibly relocated were allowed to return after the war and retake possession of their property. However, in a number of cases, this proved impossible as people created new lives in the central states and/or they lost farming land and/or water rights to the unscrupulous. Those most able to return to their old life were the fishermen of the Ensenada area. This treatment of the Japanese is not in most accounts of Mexican history and is not taught in schools.\n\nOne consequence of the war was that it caused many Japan-born to remain in Mexico, even if they had plans to one day return to Japan. The main reason for this was that the war completely destroyed the old Japan, and what they knew no longer existed. After the war, there was a strong division among the Japanese-Mexican community as to whether Japan had really lost the war, (with about ten percent refusing to believe Japan could lose). However, the division was enough to keep the Japanese-Mexicans from seeking restitution from the Mexican government or promote the memory of the displacement.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Japanese immigration to Mexico began again. From 1951 to 1978, this immigration was associated with Japan’s economic growth, giving it money to invest abroad. From the 1950s to the present, over three hundred Japanese enterprises have established themselves in Mexico and Japan is Mexico’s third largest trading partner. These companies brought highly skilled workers into the country, usually on two-year renewable visas.\n\nSince Japanese immigration began, it was a small and dispersed phenomenon, with few to no formal policies or support to Japanese immigrants. Shortly before the war, many Japanese in Mexico began to form associations called “nijonjinkai” (Japanese associations) or “kenjinkai” (associations of people from the same prefecture). However, before the war, there was no nationwide Japanese immigrant organization similar to those in the United States. The closest organization to this function was the “kyoeikai” which arose in response to the displacement of Japanese during WWII, especially in Mexico City. Later, the leaders of these organizations would form the Asociación México Japonesa, which remains today.\n\nIn 1997, descendents of Japanese immigrants celebrated a century of Japanese immigration into Mexico, with an estimated 30,000 people of Japanese nationality or ethnicity living in Mexico. Despite the immigration starting in the latter 19th century, it never reached the numbers it did in other countries such as the United States and Brazil. Japanese immigrant influence is strongest in Baja California, and can be seen in both the last names of many of its residents and the operators of maquiladoras near the U.S. border. There are still scattered communities of Japanese descendents from the first half of the 20th century in other areas. In addition to the Asociación México Japonesa, there are some regional Japanese associations such as the Asociación Japonesa del Sur de Veracruz established in 1996.\n\nThere has been little research into this ethnic group in Mexico. The main researcher is María Elena Ota Mishima who has written various works on the topic, including the book Siete Migraciones Japoneses en México 1890-1978.\n\nThere has been one notable influx of Japanese into Mexico since 1978, which is young artists from Japan who have settled mostly in Mexico City. They have come because they have found it easier to develop their careers in Mexico, as the art market in Japan is very small and very hard to break into. More people in Mexico visit museums than in Japan and the range of artistic styles is much less restricted in Mexico. In 2011, the Museo Universitario del Chopo held an exhibition called Selva de cristal: artistas japoneses en México to promote the work of artists of Japanese and Japanese descent in Mexico. Artists represented included Luis Nishizawa, Kiyoshi Takahasi, Carlos Nakatani, Kyuichi Yahai and Kiyoto Ota .\n\nNotable Japanese and Japanese-Mexicans include theater promoter Seki Sano, painters Tamiji and Tawaja and Luis Nishizawa. Tanetoshi Kirawawa founded one of the most successful Japanese businesses in Mexico, and is also known for his philanthropic work such as the publication of books and magazines about Japan including Japónica and the creation of institutions such as Liceo Mexicano-Japonés, with teaches both Japanese and Mexican children, as well as the Japan study program of the Colegio de la Frontera Norte.\n\nAs a result of Japanese investment in automotive and associated industries, there has been a significant influx of Japanese immigrants to the Bajío region. The largest increase has been in Guanajuato, which has seen a 400% increase in Japanese residents since 2013. The opening of Honda and Toyota plants in Celaya and a Mazda plant in Salamanca greatly increased the Japanese presence. As a result, branches of Japanese banks as well as the first Japanese consulate-general in Mexico have opened in León.\n\nThe Liceo Mexicano Japonés is located in Mexico City. As of 1983 some Nikkei families living in other Mexican states have their children move to Mexico City and live with their relatives so they can attend this school.\n\nIn addition, the \"Escuela Japonesa de Aguascalientes\" (アグアスカリエンテス日本人学校 \"Aguasukarientesu Nihonjin Gakkō\"), an overseas Japanese school, is in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes. As of 2013 it has 59 primary school students and 13 junior high school students for a total of 72 students.\n\nPart-time Japanese schools include the Colegio Japones de Guadalajara A.C. (グアダラハラ補習授業校 \"Guadarahara Hoshū Jugyō Kō\") in Zapopan, Jalisco and the Asociacion Regiomontana de Lengua Japonesa A.C. (モンテレー補習授業校 \"Monterē Hoshū Jugyō Kō\") in San Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León. Colegio Japones de Guadalajara is held at Secundaria y Preparatoria Femenil Colinas de San Jaier. Formerly it had its classes held at the Escuela Primaria \"Antonio Caso\" in Guadalajara. Asociacion Regiomontana was previously based in Apodaca.\n\n\n\n"}

He graduated \"magna cum laude\" from Harvard University in 1976, and earned a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1979.\n\nLeBoutillier first rose to national prominence in 1974. While still a college student at Harvard, he raised over a quarter million dollars for the campaign of former Vietnam War prisoner of war Leo K. Thorsness, a South Dakota Republican campaigning to unseat liberal senator George McGovern. As a result, LeBoutillier has been an activist on POW/MIA issues ever since.\n\nLeBoutillier's efforts on behalf of Thorsness caught the attention of President Ford's re-election campaign and in 1976 he was appointed regional coordinator, responsible for all field activities in New Jersey.\n\nLeBoutillier was elected to Congress in 1980, representing New York's 6th District. He defeated 16-year incumbent Lester L. Wolff to become the youngest member of the 97th Congress. He served on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and as a member of Special House POW/MIA Task Force. After redistricting in 1982, LeBoutillier ran unsuccessfully for re-election versus Robert J. Mrazek in New York's 3rd congressional district. In 1983, LeBoutillier was fined $7,000 by the Federal Election Commission for violating federal election laws during the course of his 1980 congressional campaign. With contributions by individuals limited to $1,000 per person, LeBoutillier accepted a $200,500 contribution from his mother. LeBoutillier's mother was also fined $7,000.\n\nUpon leaving Congress, LeBoutillier continued to be active on the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. He founded the Sky Hook II Project, dedicated to recovering living American POWs in Southeast Asia. He has made frequent trips to Laos and Vietnam and also met with Lao and Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Jakarta, New York City, Vientiane, and Paris.\n\nLeBoutillier is a frequent guest on radio and television and has hosted radio talk show programs on WMCA radio and WABC radio. He conducted an exclusive television interview with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn for NBC's \"Tomorrow Show\" in 1981, and interviewed Richard Nixon for ABC Radio in 1984. The interview was Nixon's first live network radio appearance since leaving the White House. He has been a frequent guest commentator on \"The Today Show\", \"20/20\", \"Nightline\", \"Crossfire\", and \"Imus in the Morning\". In 2004, he appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to discuss his plans to build a \"Counter-Clinton Library\" in Little Rock near the Clinton Presidential Library.\n\nHe joined with noted Canadian broadcaster Arlene Bynon in December 2010, to launch \"Bynon/LeBoutillier\", a talk radio show simultaneously airing on WABC in New York City and AM640 in Toronto while also airing in the United Kingdom.\n\nSince 2007, LeBoutillier has been a columnist at NewsMax.com. He was also a regular guest on George Galloway's radio show on Britain's talkSPORT, and more recently Galloway's talkRADIO show. He was critical of the George W. Bush administration, challenging the administration on its Iraqi War policies and the failure to halt the tide of illegal immigration. He was vocal in his opposition to the nomination of Senator John McCain as the Republican candidate in the 2008 presidential election, in part due to McCain's failure to acknowledge evidence of live American POWs left behind following the Vietnam War.\n\nLeBoutillier has written several books, most-notably the 1978 best-seller \"Harvard Hates America\", a work similar in theme to William F. Buckley's 1950 \"God and Man at Yale\". In 1989 he wrote \"Vietnam Now; The Case for Normalization\" and in 1979 co-authored a novel, \"Primary\". He is the co-author, with Edward Klein, of \"The Obama Identity\".\n\nHe has been a contributor to \"The New York Times\", the \"New York Post\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\", among others.\n\nLeBoutillier grew up on Long Island's North Shore. His father was Thomas LeBoutillier, a member of a prominent family and onetime Grumman test pilot. His mother, Pamela LeBoutillier (\"née\" Tower), is the daughter of Roderick Tower and Flora Payne Whitney, a member of the New York Whitneys who are, in turn, descendants of the Vanderbilt family. Mrs. LeBoutillier is a distant cousin of the late Senator John Tower of Texas. LeBoutillier's great great grandfather was William Collins Whitney, Secretary of the Navy under President Grover Cleveland. Another great great grandfather was Charlemagne Tower.

Many claim to be descendants of Abram Wood, who was the first Romani to reside permanently and exclusively in Wales in the early 18th century, though Romanies have appeared in Wales since the 15th century. Generally speaking, the Kale have employed a tribal structure in which a group of several family units would be under the authority of a male chieftain. However some Kale families are matriarchal with a senior woman being chosen by consensus among the other women of the family to take the leadership role.\n\nThe Kale spoke Welsh Romani. Originally the variants of Welsh Romani and the Angloromani of the Romanichal constituted a common \"British Romani\" language. Both Welsh and English Romani share characteristics and are historically closely related to Romani dialects spoken in France, Germany (Sinti), Scandinavia, Spain, Poland, North Russia and the Baltic states. Such dialects are descended from the first wave of Romani immigrants into western, northern and southern Europe in the late Middle Ages. \n\nThe Welsh Romani language survived in North Wales until at least 1950; in South Wales, a sort of \"pidgin\" dialect arose in the late 19th century, mostly consisting of Romani and English but with other loanwords from various languages (Arabic, Iranian, Greek, Romanian, German, French and Welsh) that indicate the long journey of the Kale.\n\nWhile preserving their travelling lifestyle the Kale grew to claim several aspects of Welsh culture, including conversion to Christianity, taking on Welsh surnames, and participating in regional and national eisteddfodau. Notably, John Robert Lewis, the husband of Abram Wood's granddaughter, would win prizes for harping in 1842, 1848 and 1850. \n\nAnother descendant, John Roberts, earned the sobriquet \"Telynor Cymru\", and taught his whole family various instruments.

{"id": "11673361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11673361", "title": "Lun Bawang", "text": "Lun Bawang\n\nThe Lun Bawang (formerly known as Trusan Murut or Southern Murut) is an ethnic group found in Central Northern Borneo. They are indigenous to the highlands of North Kalimantan (Krayan, Malinau, Mentarang and Long Bawan), Brunei (Temburong District), southwest of Sabah (Interior Division) and northern region of Sarawak (Limbang Division). In the Malaysian state of Sarawak, the Lun Bawang (through the term \"Murut\") are officially recognised by the Constitution as native of Sarawak and are categorised under the Orang Ulu people; whilst in the neighbouring state of Sabah and Krayan highland in Kalimantan, they are sometimes named \"Lundayeh\" or \"Lun Daye\". In Brunei, they are also identified by law as one of the 7 natives (indigenous people) of Brunei, through the term \"Murut\". Nevertheless, in Sabah, Kalimantan and Brunei, the term Lun Bawang is gaining popularity as a unifying term for this ethnic across all region. There are also other alternative names such as Lun Lod, Lun Baa' and Lun Tana Luun.\n\nLun Bawang people are traditionally agriculturalists and practise animal husbandry such as rearing poultry, pigs and buffaloes. Lun Bawangs are also known to be hunters and fisherman.\n\nThe word Lun Bawang means \"people of the country\" or \"native people\", whilst Lun Dayeh means \"upriver people\" or \"people of the interior\" or \"Orang Ulu\" and Lun Lod means \"people living downriver or near the sea\". Other names are derived from geographical reference to their rice cultivation, for example Lun Baa' (swamps) who lives near swampy areas and grow wet rice, and Lun Tana' Luun (on the land) who cultivates dry rice.\n\nWhile insisting that they never called themselves \"Murut\", the Lun Bawangs were formerly identified as \"Murut\" by the British colonists and by outsiders (other ethnic group). In Lun Bawang language, the word \"Murut\" either means 'to massage' or 'to give dowry', and these meanings have little or no relation at all to the identity of the people. The name Murut might have been derived from the word \"Murud\", a mountain located near an old Lun Bawang settlement, hence might have just meant 'mountain men' or 'hill people' but was instead used by the colonist to identify this ethnic.\n\nIn addition to that, ethnologist found that the classification under the name Murut is confusing as the term is used differently in Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei, that is whilst in Brunei and Sarawak it is used to describe the Lun Bawang people, in Sabah it is used to identify an ethnic group that is linguistically and culturally different from the Lun Bawangs.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the use of the term \"Lun Bawang\" began to gain popularity amongst ethnologist and linguist, and it is now the most commonly used term to identify this ethnic group. In Sarawak, the decision to replace the term 'Murut' to 'Lun Bawang' to identify this ethnic group was made unanimously by Lun Bawang community leaders, and the official usage of this term is now legally binding following the passing of Interpretation Act by Sarawak's Legislative Assembly in 2002.\n\nThe Lun Bawangs made up of one of the ethnic natives that occupied the Borneo Island for centuries. According to Tom Harrisson (1959) and S. Runciman (1960), the Lun Bawang Community is one of the earlier settlers in the mountainous regions of central Borneo and they are related to the Kelabit tribe. Both tribe are linked to a common lineage termed the \"Apo Duat\" or \"Apad Uat\" people, of which \"Apo Duat\" is the area consisting of the Krayan highland and Kelabit Highlands.\nOne theory suggests that Apo Duat is the homeland of this common ancestor, and that they have expanded out to the coastal area. The migration of these people to the low lands and gradual spreading out might have been spurred by various waves of migration of the Lun Bawang people from different clans. The migration of Lun Bawang people from one clan to a region already inhabited by another clan, causes the latter to move to another region, despite them having similar culture and language. The strong clan identity of the Lun Bawang people is shown by their common tradition of identifying themselves based on their village or geographical location, for example, 'Lun Adang' who once resides the Adang river basin or 'Lun Kemaloh' who comes from the Kemaloh river. \n\nOne other theory suggests that these Apo Duat people were once natives of old Brunei, but were pushed upriver into the highlands by the invading tribes such as Kayan, Kenyah and Iban people. The ones that remained downriver (Lun Bawang people) were isolated from the ones who migrated to the highlands (Kelabit), causing their culture and language to slightly diverged.\n\nAnother theory, on the other hand, suggests that the migration originated from the opposite side of Borneo (now East Kalimantan). It was suggested that the Apo Duat people were once farmers in the lowlands downstream of Malinau river, living closely with the Tidong people. However, attacks by Muslim raiders (Bugis and Tausug) probably in the 17th century, caused them to migrate to the Krayan highlands, whilst the Tidong people converted to Islam.\n\nNevertheless, these theories have yet to be proven and there are no substantial evidence to trace the origin of the Lun Bawang people or to prove any of these theories.\n\nAccording to Brunei oral tradition, the Lun Bawangs (Murut) were brought under the rule of the Brunei kingdom by peaceful measures during the reign of Awang Alak Betatar. This is said to be accomplished through dealings between the Lun Bawang and Awang Alak Betatar's brother, Awang Jerambok. Under the rule of the Brunei kingdom, the Lun Bawang were subject to taxes and tribute. The local leaders from the higher class (\"lun mebala\" or \"lun do\"') were appointed titles of nobility and were granted office in the sultanate. Some Lun Bawang were assimilated into Malay culture. Lun Bawang community located near to the Brunei capital were firmly integrated to the Brunei polity. \n\nAwang Alak Betatar and his 13 brothers were the founding fathers of Brunei, and are believed to be half Muruts, as they had a common Murut father by the name of Upai Semaring or Awang Semaun. These 14 saudaras or 14 brothers are Kelabit (Murut) and their followers were early \"empire builders\" of Brunei. Lun Bawangs and Kelabits (Muruts) are of royal descents from the House of Bolkiah, as they use titles such as Dayang, Sultan, Agong and Pengiran, names used by their ancestors in the past.\n\nNevertheless, the peace dealing between the Lun Bawang and the Brunei Malay rulers was by no means everlasting as throughout the history of Brunei sultanate, the Lun Bawang had often rebelled against its Brunei ruler. It has been suggested that the insurrection of the Maruts (\"sic\") - i.e. the Lun Bawangs - and Chinese had led to the Brunei Sultan requesting assistance from the Sulu sultanate to suppress the rebellion in 1658, which resulted in the Brunei Sultan ceding his territory of Kimanis until Tapean Durian to the Sultan of Sulu as a sign of gratitude.\n\nEarly Europeans uses the exonym \"Maroot\", \"Marut\", \" Morut\" or \"Murut\" to describe the Lun Bawang people, and this might have been introduced by the Brunei Malays who came in contact with them in Brunei. The earliest European written account of the Lun Bawang people is probably by Thomas Forrest during his voyage to New Guinea, the Moluccas and Balambangan in 1776. He described that the Borneans (\"sic\" - i.e. Bruneians -) tended to preclude the Chinese or European from directly dealing with the Maroot in trade, reserving the trade (as middlemen) to themselves.\n\nIn John Hunt's \"Sketch of Borneo or Pulo Kalamantan\" in 1812, he described the Lun Bawangs as aborigines of Borneo proper, and that they are much fairer and better featured than the Malays, having more strong and robust frame and are credited as a brave race of people. Europeans have also obtained the description of the Lun Bawang from Brunei Malays who came in contact with them. For example, during the voyage of the American \"Himmaleh\" to Brunei, Brunei noblemen (\"pangeran\") reported that there are 21 tribes in Brunei - Murut being one of them - and that these tribes are \"kafir\" (do not practice Islam) and practices headhunting. During Henry Keppel's expedition to Borneo, he noted that the Lun Bawang are inhabitant of Borneo interior, and that the Murut and Dyak people had given place to Kayan people whenever they are in contact with each other. Sir James Brooke in his journal written on 24 December 1850, described the oppression that the Lun Bawang (then called Limbang Muruts) people faced by Brunei aristocrats, and where some had fought against this tyranny.\n\nA more elaborate European account of the Lun Bawang people is by Spenser St. John in 1860, where he described the impoverished condition of the Lun Bawang (then called Limbang Muruts) people under the rule of the Brunei Sultanate. He also gave account of the aborigines (Murut and Bisaya) rise to insurrection, however these rebellions were always suppressed by threat by the Brunei government to bring in Kayans to subdue the opposition. Spenser St.John also described the tyranny conducted by the Brunei aristocrats upon the Limbang Muruts, which include seizing their children to be sold as slaves if taxes were not paid, and on one occasion, when the Brunei capital were in a state of alarm by the marauding Kayan warriors, the Brunei aristocrat offered a whole Limbang Murut village to be pillaged, in return for the safety of the capital.\n\nAlmost all of the traditional economical activities of the Lun Bawang and are related to rice plantation, and they cultivate both rice on hill called \"lati' tana' luun\" and rice from paddy field called \"lati' ba\". The production of rice is related to ones' prestige/financial status, as excess of rice harvest are traditionally consumed in huge \"irau\" feast, signifying wealth and fortune. Cooked rice is wrapped inside banana leaves called \"Luba' Laya\", and rice is also brewed into rice wine or \"burak\" for practical reasons. Partly due to this, drinking \"burak\" had been an important (and also notorious, as is deemed by the Christian missionaries and the Brooke government) custom of the Lun Bawangs, but now the rice wine production has significantly dwindled due to effort done by the Christian missionaries and Brooke government to encourage prohibition of alcohol amongst the community in the early 20th century.\n\nMeat and fish are brined or pickled using salt and is stored in hollow bamboo stalk for a duration of a month and the pickled food is called \"telu' \". Meat and fish are also preserved by smoking. Salt is obtained by evaporating brine from salt spring (\"lubang mein\").\n\nCattles and buffaloes are bred for their meat, and can serve as a symbol of financial status. These animals are commonly used as dowry that are presented to the bride's family from the groom's side.\n\nIn the old days, the men wear jackets made of tree barks called \"kuyu talun\". Cloth wrapped around the forehead is called \"sigar\" and loin cloth is called \"abpar\". A long machete (\"pelepet\") is tied to the waist, especially when it needs to be carried to tribal wars. As for the women, they wear \"pata\" on their head, \"beret\" on their waist, \"bane\" around the neck and \"gileng\" or \"pakel\" is worn as ornaments on their hands and wrists. \"Pata\", or cap made entirely of bead, is worn as a status symbol.\n\nThe Lun Bawang belong to a group termed as Nulang Arc group (Metcalf 1975). These ethnic (along with other ethnics such as the Berawans, the Melanaus and the Kajangs) traditionally practised an ancient tradition of secondary treatment of the dead. In Lun Bawang, this is called \"mitang butung\". Metcalf theorised that this practice is a characteristic of the most ancient cultural tradition in Borneo, before the arrival of other invading ethnics that influenced the diversification of culture and language in Borneo.\n\nThe Lun Bawangs called their language \"Buri Lun Bawang\" or \"Buri tau\", <nowiki>\"our language\"</nowiki> .\n\nLun Bawang people celebrate \"Irau Aco Lun Bawang\" (Lun Bawang festival) annually on the first of June in Lawas, Sarawak. This festival is traditionally a celebration of the rice harvest, but now it showcases a variety of Lun Bawang culture and events such as \"Ruran Ulung\" (beauty pageant contest) and \"ngiup suling\" (bamboo musical instrument band).\n\nIn Sipitang district of Sabah, Sabahan Lun Bawangs and Lundayeh celebrates the harvest festival (Kaamatan) biennially during the Festival of GATA (\"Gasing and Tamu Besar\"), during which traditional dances and costumes are being showcased along with those of other native ethnics in the district such as the Murut, Kedayan and Brunei Malay people.\n\nBeing a predominantly Christian community, Lun Bawang also since the 1950s traditionally celebrates \"Irau Rayeh\", which is an Easter festival and celebration.\n\nLun Bawangs were mostly animist before the 1920s. Under the rule of the White Rajahs (Vyner Brooke) in Sarawak, Christian missionaries (particularly of the Borneo Evangelical Mission) had better accessibility to the Lun Bawang settlements in the interior and highlands, and proceeded to preach Christianity to the Lun Bawang people.\n\nThe majority of the Lun Bawangs are Christians, predominantly of the Borneo Evangelical Church. A small number are of other Christian denominations, such as True Jesus Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Roman Catholic Church, or of another religion, such as Islam and Buddhism.\n\nPrior to the rule of the White Rajahs, the Lun Bawang tribe was in a deplorable state; frequently involved in tribal war, headhunting and excessive alcohol consumption. The Lun Bawang tribe were often a victim of political manipulation by the Sultanate of Brunei, for example they were used as sacrifice for the marauding Kayan people who threaten to attack the Brunei capital in the 1860s. The low standard of living had led to severe outbreak of diseases (cholera and smallpox) amongst the community, and the population significantly dwindled to the point of near extinction in the 1920s.\n\nWith the advent of Rajah rule and conversion to Christianity, the standard of living improved tremendously, as the missionaries introduced better healthcare, sanitary system and also proper education system. The Lun Bawang were very zealous at school, and in 1940, about 95% of the Lun Bawang and related Kelabit tribe under 20s in Lawas Damit are literate.\n\nThe Borneo Evangelical Mission movement has played a major role in a social and economic development of the Lun Bawang community, especially in educating the people on the importance of education and health, also in maintaining peace between Lun Bawang people and those from other ethnic living nearby. \n\nWhilst many Lun Bawangs attained higher level of education in nearby towns such as Lawas, Limbang and Miri, and in Sabah, Sipitang and Beaufort; and subsequently furthering their studies in the state capitals or in Peninsular Malaysia, there are still relatively little development of schools in Lun Bawang settlement in the interior, such as Long Pasia or Ba' Kelalan. Therefore, many Lun Bawang youth in the interior travel a distance from their home in order to pursue education, sometimes via river transport or gravel road.\n\nJob intake in some of the main industries in Sabah and Sarawak, such as oil and gas and palm oil industry remains relatively small, and some are still involved in subsistence farming and fishing. However with continued efforts, many of them managed to become professionals. A 2011 statistics has shown that there are around 233 graduates amongst the Lun Bawang community in Sarawak.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2477530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2477530", "title": "Otomi", "text": "Otomi\n\nThe Otomi (; ) are an indigenous people of Mexico inhabiting the central Mexican Plateau (Altiplano) region.\n\nThe two most populous groups are:\n\nSmaller Otomi populations exist in the states of Puebla, Mexico, Tlaxcala, Michoacán and Guanajuato. The Otomi language belonging to the Oto-Pamean branch of the Oto-Manguean language family is spoken in many different varieties, some of which are not mutually intelligible.\n\nOne of the early complex cultures of Mesoamerica, the Otomi were likely the original inhabitants of the central Mexican Altiplano before the arrival of Nahuatl speakers around CE, who replaced and marginalized them however the Otomi and their nomadic lifestyle allowed them to easily adapt to different environments avoid enemies and defend traditional lands and villages. In the early colonial New Spain period, Yųhmų Otomi of Tlaxcala helped the Spanish conquistadors as mercenaries and allies, allowing them to extend into territories such as Querétaro and Guanajuato, previously inhabited by semi-nomadic Chichimecs.\n\nThe Otomi traditionally worshipped the moon as their highest deity. Even in modern times, many Otomi populations practice shamanism and hold prehispanic beliefs such as Nagualism. Like most sedentary Mesoamerican peoples, Otomis traditionally subsisted on maize, beans and squash, but the maguey (century plant) was also an important cultigen used for production of alcohol (pulque) and fiber (henequen). Although the Otomi Indians rarely eat what Westerners would consider a balanced diet, they maintain reasonably good health by eating tortillas, drinking pulque, and eating most fruits available around them. In 1943 to 1944, a report about a nutritional study about the Otomi villages located in the Mezquital Valley of Mexico, recorded that despite the arid climate and land unfit for agriculture without irrigation, the Otomi people chiefly depended on the production of maguey. Maguey (century plant) is used to produce weaving fibers and “pulque”, a fermented unfiltered juice that played an important part in the Otomi’s economy and nutrition. However, this practice has begun to decline due to its new large-scale production. The maguey plant was so heavily depended on that huts were constructed out of the plant's leaves. During this time, most of the region was vastly underdeveloped and most agriculture was low-yielding. At times, settlement areas would be confused as locations remote of habitation. \n\nThe Otomi were blacksmiths and traded valuable metal items with other indigenous confederations, including the Aztec Triple Alliance. Their metal crafts included ornaments and weaponry, although metal weaponry was not as useful as obsidian weaponry (obsidian being sharper than a modern-day razor, abundant, and light in weight).\n\nSome historians believe that the Otomi were the first inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico, nevertheless they were later expelled from the valley by the Tepanec in 1418. The Otomi were one of various ethnic groups present within the city of Teotihuacán; one of the largest and most important cites of ancient Mexico. Around the year 1100 AD, Otomi-speaking peoples formed their capital city-state, Xaltocan. Xaltocan soon acquired power--enough power to demand tribute from nearby communities up until its subjugation. Thereafter, the Otomi kingdom was conquered during the 14th century by the Mexica and its alliances. The Otomi people then were subject to pay a tribute to the Triple-Alliance as their empire grew; subsequently, Otomi people resettled in lands to the east and south of their former territory. While some Otomi resettled elsewhere, other Otomi still resided near current-day Mexico City, but most settled in areas near the Mezquital Valley in Hidalgo, the highlands of Puebla, areas between Tetzcoco and Tulancingo, and as far as Colima and Jalisco. \n\nA sizable portion of the Otomi resided in the state of Tlaxcala, where they eventually joined forces with Spanish Conquistador Hernan Cortes, who fought the Aztec Triple-Alliance, and eventually defeated them. This allowed the ixtenco Otomi or (Yųhmų) to once again expand. They founded the City of Querétaro and settled in many towns in the state now known as Guanajuato. The Hñähñu Otomi of Mezquital maintained a state of war upon the spanish and their ixtenco otomi allies with records indicating that the hñähñu resisted assimilation and maintained nomadic raiding parties that attacked any Spanish settlement within hidalgo maintaining a state of war that lasted until the first silver mines were opened The ixtenco otomi allegiance with the Spanish led to many converting to Roman Catholicism, but they also held onto their ancient customs. While being colonized, the ixtenco Otomi language was dispersed to various other states such as Guanajuato, Querétaro,that included the states of Puebla, Veracruz, with Michoacán and Tlaxcala, where most remained farmers. In the Mezquital Valley a traditional homeland to the Otomi , the terrain was so not well equipped for farming as the land was dry, so many Otomi people hired each other as laborers and relied heavily on the maguey-based drink, pulque. Originally, the Spanish banned the drink but soon attempted to manage a business through its production which led to the Otomi people solely using the drink for their own consumption. During Mexico’s War of Independence, the Otomi sided with the rebellion as they wanted their land back that was taken from them under the encomienda system.\n\nAround 1940-50, government agencies had promised to assist the indigenous people by helping them gain access to better education and economic advancements but failed to do so. In turn, the people continued to farm and work as laborers within their minor subsistence economy within a larger capitalistic economy where the indigenous people was able to be exploited by those who are in control of the economy. Since gaining independence, the Mexican government has adopted an adoring attitude towards the pre-Hispanic history and works of the Aztecs and Mayans; meanwhile, it has disregarded the living indigenous people, such as the Otomi who are depicted without the same prestige. Until recently, the Otomi culture and people were not given much attention or focus until recent anthropologist began investigating their ancient way of life. As a result, the Mexican government has gone as far declaring themselves a pluricultural nation that serves to help many of its indigenous populations, like the Otomi. However, this has not been the case with scarce evidence proving that anything is done to truly help them. Although many of the current descendants of the Otomi have begun to immigrate to other region, there is still a hint of their ancient culture present today. In certain parts of Mexico, such as Guanajuato and Hidalgo, prayer songs in Otomi are heard and elders share tales the youth who understand their native language. Despite this, very little attention has been placed on the Otomi culture, especially through education means where very little is discussed about any indigenous groups. Because of this, many Otomi descendants know very little about their own cultures history.\n\nThe name Otomi is an exonym and comes from the Nahuatl \"otomitl\", which is possibly derived from an older word \"totomitl\" \"shooter of birds\". However, the Otomi refer to themselves as \"Hñähñú\", \"Hñähño\", \"Hñotho\", \"Hñähü\", \"Hñätho\", \"Yųhų\", \"Yųhmų\", \"Ñųhų\", \"Ñǫthǫ\" or \"Ñañhų\", depending on which dialect of Otomi they speak. Most of the variant forms have two morphemes, meaning \"speak\" and \"well\" respectively.\n\nThe word \"Otomi\" entered Spanish through Nahuatl and is used to describe the larger Otomi macroethnic group and the dialect continuum. From Spanish, the word \"Otomi\" has become entrenched in linguistic and anthropological literature. Among linguists, the suggestion has been made to change the academic designation from \"Otomi\" to \"Hñähñú\", the endonym used by the Otomi of the Mezquital Valley, but no common endonym exists for all dialects of the language.\n\nOtomi is in the Oto-Pamean languages family (which also includes Chichimeca Jonaz, Mazahua, Pame, Ocuilteco, and Matlatzinca). The family in turn belongs to the Oto-Manguean languages (with Amuzgoan, Chinantecan, Mixtecan, Otopamean, Popolocan, Tlapanecan, and Zapotec language families).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1738560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1738560", "title": "Page (servant)", "text": "Page (servant)\n\nA page or page boy is traditionally a young male attendant or servant, but may also have been used for a messenger at the service of a nobleman. The origin of the term is uncertain, but it may come either from the Latin \"pagus\" (servant), possibly linked to peasant, or an earlier Greek word (\"pais\" = child). During wedding ceremonies, a page boy is often used as a symbolic attendant to carry the rings, a role comparable to the scattering of flower petals by flower girls.\n\nIn medieval times, a page was an attendant to a nobleman, a knight, a Governor or a Castellan. Until the age of about seven, sons of noble families would receive training in manners and basic literacy from their mothers or other female relatives. Upon reaching seven years of age, a boy would be sent to the castle, great house or other estate of another noble family. This would match the age at which apprenticeships or servants' employment would be entered into by young males from lower social classes.\n\nA young boy served as a page for about seven years, running messages, serving, cleaning clothing and weapons, and learning the basics of combat. He might be required to arm or dress the lord to whom he had been sent by his own family. Personal service of this nature was not considered as demeaning, in the context of shared noble status by page and lord. It was seen rather as a form of education in return for labour. While a page did not receive reimbursement other than clothing, accommodation and food, he could be rewarded for an exceptional act of service. In return for his work, the page would receive training in horse-riding, hunting, hawking and combat – the essential skills required of adult men of his rank in medieval society. Less physical training included schooling in the playing of musical instruments, the composition and singing of songs, and the learning of board games such as chess. The initial education received as a child in reading and writing, would be continued to a level of modest competence under the tuition of a chaplain or other cleric, and possibly from a grammar master. They also learned courtly manners and, in attending to the needs of their master, a degree of temporary humility. \n\nMedieval pages might accompany their lords to war. While their roles in battle were generally limited to secondary assistance and minor support functions, pages might expect to participate directly in siege situations. This could occur when a castle was under attack and crossbows were available for use by pages among the defenders. The mechanical and long-range nature of these devices made them almost the only medieval weapon which could be employed effectively by a youth. \n\nAt age fourteen, the young noble could graduate to become a squire, and by age 21, perhaps a knight himself. These boys were often the scions of other great families who were sent to learn the ways of the manorial system by observation. Their residence in the house served as a goodwill gesture between the two families involved and helped them gain social and political contacts for their adult lives. A reference to this kind of page is found in the Christmas carol \"Good King Wenceslaus\": \"Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know'st it, telling...\"\n\nThis type of page is almost unheard of today outside of royal residences, although the functions and status of legislative pages are a clear continuation of the earlier role.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, boys of humble background might gain a similar place in a great house. According to the International Butler Academy, these pages were apprentice footmen. Unlike the hall boys, who did heavy work, these pages performed light odd-jobs and stood in attendance wearing livery when guests were being received.\n\nDuring and following the Renaissance, it became fashionable for black boys and young men to be decorative pages, placed into fancy costumes and attending fashionable ladies and lords. This custom lasted for several centuries and the \"African page\" became a staple accoutrement of baroque and rococo style.\n\nThe character is frequently illustrated in literature and film, particularly periodwork: \n\nSimilarly, Oriental pages were periodically in fashion, e.g. in Napoleonic France since Bonaparte's conquest of Ottoman Egypt.\n\nWhile the traditional pages are rare in the modern private workforce, US television network NBC's page program is a notable example of contemporary workplace pages.\n\n"}

It publishes academic journals, conference proceedings, anthologies, and online research databases, often in cooperation with scholarly and professional associations. It also provides membership management and electronic publishing services, and hosts electronic journals, series, and other publications from several countries.\n\nThe Philosophy Documentation Center was established in 1966 at Bowling Green State University in Ohio to manage the publication of specialized reference works in philosophy. It was founded by two members of the university philosophy department, Ramona Cormier and Richard Lineback, who recognized a need to improve access to the growing body of philosophical literature in English and other languages. Its first publication was \"The Philosopher’s Index\", which provided bibliographic listings, indexed by subject and author, of recently published journal articles in philosophy. In 1970 PDC assumed responsibility for the publication of the \"Directory of American Philosophers\" and the \"International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers\".\n\nIn 1974, PDC began publishing a series of research bibliographies to provide systematic overviews of the primary and secondary work of major philosophers. That same year PDC published its first journal, \"Philosophy Research Archives\", in cooperation with the American Philosophical Association and the Canadian Philosophical Association. This bilingual project was established in microfiche format in an effort to overcome the space limitations of traditional print journals. This concept was developed by representatives of the American Council of Learned Societies, the Humanities Research Council of Canada, PDC, and the American and Canadian philosophical associations. It was one of the earliest experiments with non-traditional formats in journal publishing and is freely available online.\n\nIn 1977, PDC published a collection of papers from the First National Workshop-Conference on Teaching Philosophy, its first publishing work in support of a new professional organization. PDC also provided publishing services to independent philosophy publications for the first time. PDC's production support for serial publications in print and electronic format has expanded significantly since that time. PDC currently produces over a hundred print and electronic publications in philosophy and neighboring disciplines, and provides online access to complete sets of journals and series in several languages.\n\nIn 1995 the editor and owner of \"The Philosopher’s Index\" retired from Bowling Green State University and ended his long association with PDC. Since 1995 he has continued to publish \"Philosopher's Index\" separate from PDC with his own organization (Philosopher's Information Center). PDC continued to develop other publications and services, with a focus on the publishing and membership management needs of professional associations and scholarly societies. The scope of this work increased over time, with notable projects such as the \"Proceedings of the Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy\" and the major publications of the American Philosophical Association. Fields covered by PDC now include applied ethics, classics, philosophy, religious studies, and semiotics. It manages memberships for twenty organizations, and this work includes secure hosting, digital work flow management, authenticated access to electronic resources, and online conference registration.\n\nIn 2001 PDC relocated its operations and most of its staff to Charlottesville, Virginia as a consequence of increasing technical demands of this expanding range of services.\n\nIn 1979, PDC launched dial-up access to \"The Philosopher's Index\" database in cooperation with DIALOG; \"Philosopher's Index\" was made available on CD-ROM in 1990. In 1992, PDC published \"The Logic Works\", an instructional software program for introductory logic courses, in cooperation with Rob Brady. A number of versions of this DOS-based program were published by PDC for 10 years. PDC also published \"EthicsWorks\", a software package for introductory ethics courses, in cooperation with Robert Pielke. In 1996, PDC partnered with InteLex Corporation to develop . This project made the content of dozens of print journals accessible online in conjunction with print subscriptions. It also allowed for the creation of complete back issue collections of several journals on CD-ROM, including \"Business Ethics Quarterly\", \"Philosophy & Theology\", \"The Review of Metaphysics\", and \"Teaching Philosophy\".\n\nIn 2009, PDC launched its eCollection of journals and series from several countries, with onlince access for institutions, single individuals, and membership organizations. PDC partnered with PORTICO to ensure long term preservation of this collection and also participates in the CLOCKSS digital archive.\n\nIn 2010, PDC launched the International Directory of Philosophy, an online database consolidating the content of the \"Directory of American Philosophers\" and the \"International Directory of Philosophy and Philosophers\". This database contains information on university philosophy departments and programs, professional societies, research centers, journals, and publishers in approximately 130 countries.\n\nIn 2011, PDC launched the Philosophy Research Index, a new indexing database not associated with \"The Philosopher's Index\", the \"International Philosophical Bibliography\", or other resource. The goal of the project was to build complete bibliographic coverage of philosophical literature in several languages and by July 2014 it contained over 1.3 million listings. At that time PDC partnered with the PhilPapers Foundation and Philosophy Research Index was incorporated into the PhilPapers database.\n\nPDC provides single document access options for non-subscribers for all journals and series on its site, including a free preview of the first page of each document. The implementation allows each publication to choose its own access terms. Pre-publication access to forthcoming articles is provided for select titles.\n\nPDC is a member of CrossRef and integrates digital object identifiers into all journals it publishes.

In 1969, Denmark became the first country in the world to legalize pornography.\n\nPeople in Denmark have free access to pornography. There are a few regulations: for example, pornography must be placed out of the eyesight of children, and it may not be sold to persons under the age of 15. The public TV channel Kanal København broadcast hardcore pornography free and uncoded at night, in the early 2000s.\n\nPrior to 2015 there were no specific restrictions against animal pornography and such affairs came under animal cruelty laws. If no harm or pain has been inflicted on the animal, such acts are not illegal. This changed in late April 2015, when Denmark passed a new law, making sex with animals illegal. This lack of legislation has allegedly made Denmark a center for the production of animal pornography. This accusation, however, was dismissed as a myth by Det Dyreetiske Råd, a legal council, which in November 2006 published an extensive report on the topic of animal sex.\n\nSince 1980, child pornography has been illegal in Denmark.

There was a marginal rise in the rate of increase in NHS productivity, to set against higher transaction costs, but healthcare remained free at the point of service and financed through taxation. Kenneth Arrow's famous essay \"Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care\" outlines the difficulties of applying principles of competition in the medical care industry. The system was regarded by some as a success: the 1997 Labour government did not entirely abolish it on taking office. GP Fundholding was abolished, but replaced by Primary Care Trusts as purchasers of healthcare. As Klein says this was \"universalising fundholding while repudiating the concept\".\n\nIn October 2014 a row broke out over whether University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust should be allowed to turn away patients from outside its immediate catchment area. Chief Executive Dame Julie Moore said the NHS is neither an effective market nor a managed system. She argued that her hospital was suffering financially because of its success in attracting patients from outside the City.\n\nCritics of quasi-markets argue that they can lead to problems of what's called \"cream skimming\". \n\nFor example, the introduction of open enrollment in UK secondary schools after 1988 (whereby parents could choose which secondary school to send their child to, rather than being limited to the nearest) led to popular schools being oversubscribed. This allowed these schools to select which pupils they would accept, leading some to discriminate against children from low-income backgrounds or non-traditional family structures (e.g. inviting \"both\" of a child's parents to an informal meeting with the headteacher so as to determine by stealth whether the child comes from an \"appropriate\" family). Open enrollment also led popular schools to expand their intake, leading to the growth of very large schools with resulting discipline problems, at the expense of smaller schools and rural schools.\n\n\n"}

His exact role has never been very clear; he was one of the great 'unknowns' of the Sicilian and American Mafia. He was one of the highest-level Sicilian Mafia leaders in his time. His counsel was sought in important decisions affecting the American Mafia as well. He traveled extensively between Italy and the United States.\n\nSorge was a relative of Sicilian Mafia boss Giuseppe Genco Russo. His first problems with the judicial authorities go back to 1928 in his hometown Mussomeli for brawling and grievous bodily harm. The charges were dismissed when the peasant accusing him retracted, offering his apologies for causing trouble. In 1932 he was convicted in Paris (France) to six months' incarceration and a fine of 1,200 French francs for forgery and using a false passport. A year later he was convicted in Ghent (Belgium) to five months and 20,000 Belgian francs for fraud.\n\nOther sentences for fraud and bad checks followed in Palermo in 1937 and in Turin in 1939. In 1948 he was convicted to three years and four months on unclear charges for 'political conspiracy' in Florence (probably related to espionage). Meanwhile, he moved to the United States. He became a naturalized US citizen living in New York City, and maintained a respectable front in America, through directorships in front companies such as Rimrock International Oil Company of New York and the Foreign Economic Research Association.\n\nHe was considered to be a lieutenant of Lucky Luciano in the post-World War II heroin business, trafficking heroin produced in France by Corsican gangsters to the US. The opium needed to produce the heroin was cultivated in Turkey and Iran. The opium was processed into morphine base, after it was transported across Syria into Lebanon. From Beirut, Lebanon, or Aleppo, Syria, the morphine base was shipped to clandestine laboratories in France for conversion into heroin.\n\nSorge, an articulate and well looking man with a good education, was probably in charge of moving the money. Owing to his friendship with Genco Russo, he had the right high political contacts in Italy, even among government members. He used companies in the US, Sicily and Panama.\n\nSorge was present at series of meetings between top American and Sicilian mafiosi that took place in Palermo between October 12–16, 1957, in the Grand Hotel Delle Palme in Palermo. Joseph Bonanno, Lucky Luciano, John Bonventre, Frank Garofalo and Carmine Galante were among the American Mafiosi present, while among the Sicilian side there were Salvatore \"Ciaschiteddu\" Greco and his cousin Salvatore \"The Engineer\" Greco, Giuseppe Genco Russo, Angelo La Barbera, Gaetano Badalamenti, Calcedonio Di Pisa and Tommaso Buscetta.\n\nAccording to some, one of the main topics on the agenda was the organization of the heroin trade on an international basis. The FBI believed it was this meeting that established the Bonanno crime family in the heroin trade. Sorge apparently was key to the meeting, which did not start before he arrived in Palermo, although Bonanno, Bonventre and Galante had already spent some days in Sicily. The meeting ended when Sorge left Palermo.\n\nIn August 1965, Sorge and 16 others associated with the Sicilian and American Mafia were indicted in Palermo by judge Aldo Vigneri for criminal conspiracy and narcotics and currency rackets in relation with 1957 meeting. Also indicted were Joe Bonanno, John Bonventre, Carmine Galante, Gaspare Magaddino, John Priziola, Raffaele Quasarano, Frank Coppola and Joe Adonis. Sorge was never arrested although Italy sought his extradition. The case against the accused was dismissed for insufficient evidence in June 1968.\n\nIn 1967, Sorge sued the city of New York and two retired senior New York police men, John F. Shaney and Ralph Salerno of the NYPD's special unit on organized crime, in a defamation and libel case asking US$418,000 in damages. Salerno had testified in 1965 before judge Vigneri of the Palermo Criminal Court, that Sorge had close relationships with Luciano, Vito Genovese, Galante and Bonanno.\n\nAccording to Sorge the retired officers provided false information, who admitted that they could not prove their allegations with certainty. According to Salerno, Sorge \"was interested in Cosa Nostra in general for which he maintains public relations.\" The libel suit was dismissed in March 1968. Sorge also brought a libel suit against Parade Publications for US$1.16 million on the basis of a magazine article by Jack Anderson published on January 21, 1962, which had said that Sorge was listed by Harry Anslinger, the former Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, as the number five boss in the top ten bosses of the American underworld.\n\nJudge Vigneri had also gone to visit Mafia turncoat Joe Valachi, who told him: \"I know Santo Sorge and I know he belongs to the Cosa Nostra. It is my personal knowledge that his function was to go and come from America to Italy and vice-versa, carrying out tasks that I don't know. I was never able to understand to what family he belongs. He was a close friend of all Cosa Nostra bosses.\" He was very close with Carlo Gambino, the head of the Gambino crime family in New York City.\n\n"}

{"id": "28299313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28299313", "title": "Vazimba", "text": "Vazimba\n\nThe Vazimba (Malagasy ), according to popular belief, were the first inhabitants of Madagascar. While beliefs about the physical appearance of the Vazimba reflect regional variation, they are generally described as smaller in stature than the average person, leading some scientists to speculate that they may have been a pygmy people (and therefore a separate Malagasy ethnic group) who migrated from the islands that constitute modern-day Indonesia and settled in Madagascar over the course of the period between 350 BCE–500 CE. Scientific evidence confirms the first arrival and subsequent increase of human settlers on the island during this period, but the pygmy theory has not been proven. Stories about the Vazimba form a significant element in the cultural history and collective identity of the Malagasy people, ranging from the historical to the supernatural, inspiring diverse beliefs and practices across the island. They have analogs in some other Autronesian cultures, including the Menehunes in Hawaii.\n\nThe facts surrounding the initial settling of Madagascar by oceanic explorers from the region of modern-day Indonesia, including the precise timing and nature of this colonization, remain a subject of ongoing debate and study. It has been theorized that there may have been successive waves of early settlement in Madagascar. According to this theory, the waves originated from the same region of southeast Asia, spoke the same language and shared the same culture. When the second wave arrived, they found the island sparsely populated by descendants of the first wave whose culture and way of life had evolved from relatively primitive roots, reflecting centuries of adaptation to local surroundings in total isolation from outside threats. According to popular belief, the Vazimba did not possess knowledge of metallurgy or rice farming and used weapons made of clay. After Bantu-speaking settlers from East Africa migrated to the island and brought their culture of zebu cattle herding with them, the Vazimba were said to have herded their zebu without eating them for meat. If the multi-wave settlement theory is correct, the indigenous (first-wave) population that the more technologically advanced second-wave settlers would have encountered upon arrival in Madagascar would provide the historic basis for stories of the primitive nature of the Vazimba societies they are said to have encountered there.\n\nArchaeological research and oral histories have provided some indication of how these early inhabitants of the highlands might have lived. Upon their arrival in those ancient tropical highland forests, the Vazimba practiced \"tavy\" (swidden, slash-and-burn agriculture) to clear the land for cultivating bananas, tubers, ginger and other staples. They gathered honey, fruits and edible seeds and hunted small game in the forests. As their population increased, villages were established and ruled by chiefs and later kings. Rulers are believed to have reddened their hair using a local mushroom; the association of the color red with royalty is found in many parts of Madagascar to this day.\n\nOral history classifies the Vazimba according to the parts of the island where they are believed to have settled. The \"vazimba andrano\" (\"Vazimba of the Water\") settled along rivers and lakes. The \"vazimba antety\" (\"Vazimba of the Soil\") were believed to be the most numerous and were reportedly clustered around the valley of Betsiriry in the central Highlands. The \"vazimba antsingy\" (\"Vazimba of the Tsingy\") lived in the caves around the limestone formations (tsingy) of Bemaraha in western Madagascar and were believed to scavenge fruit and other forest products to live.\n\nThe first period of Malagasy oral history is known as the Vazimba period (\"faha vazimba\"), beginning with the initial population of the island by the Vazimba and their establishment of kingdoms – often ruled by Queens – in the central Highlands region of Madagascar. According to some accounts, the first Vazimba sovereign of the central highlands was named Andriandravindravina. The second period in the oral history of the Highlands begins with the conquest of the Vazimba Highland kingdoms by Merina sovereigns in what would come to be known as Imerina in their honor. Andriamanelo (1540–1575) – who was himself half-Vazimba through his antecedents Queen Rangita and Queen Rafohy – is credited (along with his successors, Ralambo and Andrianjaka) with successfully forcing the Vazimba out of the Highlands and into the western part of the island.\n\nIt is commonly believed that the last of the Vazimba were annihilated during the reign of Andrianjaka (1610–1630). However, dismissing the stories of distinctive Vazimba physical appearance, Jean-Pierre Domenichini has theorized that the term \"Vazimba\" may have been more of a statement of cultural than ethnic difference and that many who had been considered Vazimba in this period did not die out, but instead may have simply chosen to become assimilated into the vanquishing Merina culture. The oral history of many Merina and Betsileo families speaks of intermarriage between Merina and Vazimba ancestors, and some Malagasy speculate that the hunter-gatherer Mikea peoples and the Vezo fishing tribe, both concentrated along the coastline of western and southern Madagascar, may be descended from Vazimba.\nThere are many legends and stories in Malagasy oral history relating to important Vazimba figures. For instance, oral history tells of a Vazimba woman named Ramboamana and a Vazimba man named Ramboabesofy, known as \"tompon-tany\" (masters of the land) – the earliest inhabitants of Madagascar, who settled in the region of Ankavandra. The couple had two sons named Rangoromana and Zafihisoky whom legend credits as the first to bring zebu to the island.\nSome Merina trace their genealogy back to a man named Ndrenavoavo or his sister Pelamana who, according to oral history, were the very first non-Vazimba people (i.e. second-wave settlers) to arrive in Madagascar. They are believed to be buried in a forest near Tsirendresaka. It is said that their tomb was venerated by all the Vazimba of Betsiriry, and in return, the people of Tsirendresaka observe a \"fady\" (taboo) that forbids the killing of zebu, in homage to the Vazimba and their tradition of herding cattle without consuming them.\n\nIn Madagascar today, popular belief maintains that the Vazimba may not have been human at all, but rather a sort of monster or often malevolent spirit that haunts natural sites such as rivers, boulders or gorges. Oral history maintains that it was customary among Vazimba to submerge their dead in designated bogs or other waters and these areas are held sacred, sometimes becoming sites of pilgrimage and sacrifice. The Vazimba are often envisioned as being smaller than the average person, either quite pale or very dark. The more monstrous descriptions of Vazimba speak of an unnaturally elongated face with large lips concealing fang-like teeth. Among the many beliefs related to the Vazimba, it is said they cannot stand to touch any object that has made contact with salt, and it is forbidden to bring garlic or pork into an area believed to contain a Vazimba tomb.\n\n"}

She is the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Nike, and was associated with Bellona. She was adapted from the Sabine agricultural goddess Vacuna and had a temple on the Palatine Hill. The goddess Vica Pota was also sometimes identified with Victoria. Victoria is often described as a daughter of Pallas and Styx, and as a sister of Zelus, Kratos, and Bia.\n\nUnlike the Greek \"Nike\", the goddess Victoria (Latin for \"victory\") was a major part of Roman society. Multiple temples were erected in her honor. When her statue was removed in 382 CE by Emperor Gratianus there was much anger in Rome. She was normally worshiped by triumphant generals returning from war.\n\nAlso unlike the Greek Nike, who was known for success in athletic games such as chariot races, Victoria was a symbol of victory over death and determined who would be successful during war.\n\nVictoria appears widely on Roman coins, jewelry, architecture, and other arts. She is often seen with or in a chariot, as in the late 18th-century sculpture representing Victory in a quadriga on the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany; \"Il Vittoriano\" in Rome has two. Nike or Victoria was the charioteer for Zeus in his battle to over take Mount Olympus.\n\nWinged figures, very often in pairs, representing victory and referred to as \"victories\", were common in Roman official iconography, typically hovering high in a composition, and often filling spaces in spandrels or other gaps in architecture. These represent the spirit of victory rather than the goddess herself. They continued to appear after Christianization of the Empire, and slowly mutated into Christian angels.\n\n"}

They were farmer-owned co-operatives, created to break the power of the large for-profit corporations, that had dominated the grain trade in Western Canada since the late 19th Century, and were an early source of Western alienation.\n\nThe wheat pools were successful grain traders and marketers from 1923 to 1929. During the Great Depression, however, huge losses forced them out of the grain marketing business. They persisted as grain elevator operators but after 1935 all grain marketing in Canada shifted to a new government agency, Canadian Wheat Board.\n\nDuring the post-war era, the wheat pools almost completely replaced the private grain companies as elevator operators. By the 1990s, however, most had demutualized (privatized), and several mergers occurred. Now all the former wheat pools are part of the Viterra corporation, which itself was acquired by Glencore Xstrata in 2013.\n\nThe pools were the culmination of a long tradition of agrarian activism dating back decades in the Prairie Provinces of Canada which peaked in the 1920s. One notable date was the founding of the Territorial Grain Growers Association (T.G.G.A.) in 1901. The T.G.G.A.'s successor organizations would be important organizers in the later campaigning to organize the wheat pools. The co-operative movement was also being established in Canada at this time.\n\nAt this time farmers in the Prairie Provinces were deeply alienated from the Canadian political and economic status quo. Farmers accepted as common knowledge that grain companies, railways, banks, and the government were part of a system that sought to exploit and oppress farmers. They developed a class solidarity and a fear and loathing of the ruling elite.\n\nSpecifically they despised the private grain trade system as symbolized by Winnipeg Grain Exchange. Farmers suspected the grain traders of being middle men who only profited by leeching off the efforts of farmers without adding any value. They were especially angered by the practice of hedging that private traders used on the futures exchange, which they believed allowed traders to profit from falling markets, hurting farmers. They also believed that private traders artificially held down prices during the fall harvest in order to shortchange producers.\n\nSome attempts had been made to set up co-operative grain elevators. There were many local co-ops that owned a single elevator, but the two most important were the United Grain Growers (U.G.G.) and the Saskatchewan-government backed Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company (Sask. Co-op Elevators). U.G.G. was formed by merger of two smaller co-ops: the Alberta government-backed Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company and the Grain Growers Grain Company (G.G.G.C., which had previously acquired the elevators of failed Manitoba government elevator company) in 1917. Following the merger, U.G.G. was a powerful force with 300 elevators and a terminal at the Lakehead. While U.G.G. and Sask. Co-op Elevators were farmer-owned, they did not follow the traditional co-op structure of paying dividends back to the users on a patronage basis (per the amount of business), instead they paid dividends to shareholder-investors. For diehard co-operators this was unacceptable. Furthermore, the two companies were unable to negotiate a merger between themselves and were not involved in marketing grain overseas. They lacked the size or reach to challenge the open-market system.\n\nDuring the Great War the Canadian government had completely taken over the grain industry. The government created a series of boards in and around the war, each with progressively more power to control the grain trade. The Board of Grain Commissioners of 1912 was purely for regulation (to supervise grading, etc.), but by 1915 the government had seized control of all wheat exports to help the war effort, and by 1917 futures trading on the Winnipeg Exchange was banned. In 1917, the new Board of Grain Supervisors was given monopoly powers over wheat, and fixed uniform prices across the country. Soon after the Board took over marketing of crops as well. Farmers were worried that after the war prices would crash and various agrarian groups lobbied Ottawa to keep the Board in place. The government relented by creating the Canadian Wheat Board for the 1919 crop only. Farmers got a guaranteed price for that crop, paid immediately, and later a further payment once the Board had sold all harvest and made a profit. This system of guaranteed prices and distributed income was extremely popular and when the Board dissolved in 1920, farmers were livid. It certainly did not help that, \"from a peak of $2.85 per bushel in September, 1920 [prices] began a slow and sickening decline to less than a dollar a bushel in late 1923.\" This marked contrasted to the stable prices of 1919–1920 Board seemed to confirm farmer's suspicions of market trading.\n\nThere were three wheat pools in Canada:\n\n"}

The Yakkha-speaking villages are located to the East of the Arun river, in the southern part of the Sankhuwasabha district and in the northern part of the Dhankuta district of Nepal. About 14,000 people still speak the language, out of 17,003 ethnic Yakkha in Nepal. Genealogically, Yakkha belongs to the Eastern Kiranti languages and is in one subgroup with several Limbu languages, e.g. Belhare, Athpare, Chintang and Chulung . Ethnically however, the Yakkha people perceive themselves as distinct from the other Kiranti groups such as Limbu. \n\nMugali is spoken between Mugakhola and Sinuwakhola on the eastern banks of the Arun River in Dhankuta District, Kosi Zone, Nepal, in the villages (VDC's) of Muga, Pakhribas, and Phalate.\n\nPhangduwali is spoken above the Mugakhola headwaters in Pakhribas VDC, Dhankuta District, Kosi Zone, Nepal.\n\nLumba-Yakkha is spoken in Arkhaule Jitpur and Marek Katahare VDC's, northern Dhankuta District, Kosi Zone, Nepal.\n\nYakkha has the five vowels . There are no centralized vowels as in other Kiranti languages. Variation between short and long vowels is possible, but this is not a phonemic contrast, because no minimal pairs can be found. Diphthongs such as can be found in some words such as \"uimalaŋ\" \"steep descent\", or the interjection \"hoiʔ\" \"Enough!\".\n\nThe consonants are shown in the table below. The voiced consonants in brackets have doubtful status. They are not phonemes, because no minimal pairs can be established. But they are also not motivated by a phonological rule. Furthermore, the voiced consonants occur only in a few words, and some of them are Nepali loans. Examples with initial voiced consonants are \"gogoba\" (an insect/worm), \"ghak\" \"all\", \"jeppa\" \"really\", \"ɖaŋgak\" \"stick\".\n\nNotes:\n\"aka\"my\n\nYakkha has rich nominal and verbal morphology. Nouns inflect for case and number. Verbs inflect for person, number (singular, dual, plural/nonsingular), negation, several categories in the domain of tense, aspect and mood. In transitive verbs, both actor and undergoer are coreferenced on the verb. The category of inclusive/exclusive is found in the verbal morphology and in the possessive pronouns and prefixes.\n\nYakkha pronouns distinguish between singular, dual and plural number, and the possessive pronouns additionally distinguish between the inclusion and the exclusion of the addressee. The third person only has singular and nonsingular forms. The possessive pronouns have developed from the personal pronouns and the genitive marker \"-ka\". The possessive prefixes obviously are grammaticalised possessive pronouns. They can be used instead of the possessive pronouns, e.g. one could say \"akka paŋ\" or \"a-paŋ\", both meaning \"my house\". Sounds represented by /N/ in the table are underspecified nasals. \n\nYakkha has the following interrogative pronouns and other interrogatives: \"isa\" \"who\", \"i/ina\" \"what\", \"iya\" \"what\" (if many items or uncountables are asked for), \"hetna\" \"which\", \"imin\" \"how\", \"ijaŋ\" \"why\", \"hetne\" \"where\", \"hetniŋ\" \"when\". \nIf a certain item is asked for, \"ina\" will be used, but if an event is in question, the root \"i\" occurs without further morphology, e.g. \"i leksa?\" \"What happened?\". Reduplication of the pronouns may result in indefinite reference, e.g. \"hetniŋ hetniŋ\" \"some time\".\n\nYakkha distinguishes the unmarked absolutive case, the ergative \"-ŋa\", the genitive \"-ka/-ga\", the locative \"-pe/-be\", the ablative case \"-bhaŋ\" and the comitative case \"-nuŋ\", and the instrumental case \"-ŋa\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
