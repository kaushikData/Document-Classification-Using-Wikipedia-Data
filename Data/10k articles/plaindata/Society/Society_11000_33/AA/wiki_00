French has been the official language of the Aosta Valley since 1561, when it replaced Latin. In the 1861 census, the first held after the unification of Italy, 93% declared being Francophone; in 1921, the last census with a question about language found that 88% of the population was French-speaking. The suppression of all French-language schools and institutions and violence against French speakers during the forcible Italianisation campaign of the Fascist government irretrievably damaged the status of French in the region. Italian and French are nowadays the region's official languages and are used for the regional government's acts and laws, though Italian is much more widely spoken in everyday life, and French is mostly used by intellectuals and within cultural events. Though French was re-introduced as an official language after World War II, by 2003 just 0.99% reported speaking standard French natively. French remains widely known as a second language, but it is no longer spoken as part of daily life. In 2001, 75.41% of the population of Aosta Valley was French-speaking, 96.01% declared to know Italian, 55.77% Franco-Provençal, and 50.53% all of them. School education is delivered equally in both Italian and French so that everyone who went to school in Aosta Valley can speak French and Italian at least at a medium-high level.\n\nAostan French is characterized by terms adopted from the patois francoprovençal valdôtain and sometimes from Italian.

Have an affair.\" The name comes from two popular female names in North America, \"Ashley\" and \"Madison.\"\n\nThe company received attention on July 15, 2015, after hackers stole all of its customer data—including emails, names, home addresses, sexual fantasies and credit card information—and threatened to post the data online if Ashley Madison and fellow Avid Life Media site EstablishedMen.com were not permanently closed. By July 22, the first set of customer names were released by hackers, with all of the user data released on August 18, 2015. More data (including some of the CEO's emails) was released on August 20, 2015. The release included data from customers who had previously paid a $19 fee to Ashley Madison to supposedly have their data deleted. The fee was also applied to people who had accounts set up against their will, as a workplace prank, or because of a mistyped email address.\n\nOn August 28, 2015, Noel Biderman agreed to step down as chief executive officer of Avid Life Media Inc. A statement released by the firm said his departure was \"in the best interest of the company\".\n\nIn July 2016, parent company Avid Life Media re-branded itself to Ruby Corp. and appointed Rob Segal as its new CEO. In the same month, the company changed its signature tagline from \"Life is Short. Have an Affair.\" to \"Find your moment,\" and updated its brand imagery to replace the image of a woman wearing a wedding ring with a red gem-shaped symbol as its logo.\nAshley Madison is a membership website and service based in Canada; its membership includes 39 million people in 53 countries.\nThe company announced plans to launch in Singapore in 2014. However, Singapore's Media Development Authority (MDA) announced that it will not allow Ashley Madison to operate in Singapore as \"it promotes adultery and disregards family values\".\n\nUnlike Match.com or eHarmony, Ashley Madison's business model is based on credits rather than monthly subscriptions. For a conversation between two members, one of the members—almost always the man—must pay five credits to initiate the conversation. Any follow-up messages between the two members are free after the communication has been initiated. Ashley Madison also has a real-time chat feature where credits buy a certain time allotment.\n\nThe site allows users to hide their account profiles for free. Users looking to delete their accounts, even those made without the individual's consent, are charged a $19 fee. The \"full delete\" option claims to remove user profiles, all messages sent and received, site usage history, personally identifiable information, and photos. The data disclosures in 2015 revealed that this \"permanent deletion\" feature did not permanently delete anything, and all data was recoverable.\n\nTrish McDermott, a consultant who helped found Match.com, accused Ashley Madison of being a \"business built on the back of broken hearts, ruined marriages, and damaged families\". Biderman responded by stating that the site is \"just a platform\" and a website or a commercial will not convince anyone to commit adultery. According to Biderman, affairs help preserve many marriages.\n\nAshley Madison offers a guarantee that users will \"find someone\": \"we GUARANTEE that you will successfully find what you're looking for or we'll give you your money back\" In order to qualify, users must purchase the most expensive package, send more expensive \"priority\" messages to 18 unique members each month for three months, send 5 Ashley Madison gifts per month, and engage in 60 minutes of paid chat per month. Compounding the problem is that \"more men than women use the service, with the disparity increasing as they advance in age\", and \"Men seek sex, while women seek passion.\" A page on Ashley Madison, entitled \"Is Ashley Madison a scam? Is Ashley Madison a fraud?\" addressed some of these issues in an attempt to win over prospective customers and teach them best practices for using the site.\n\nSegal and Millership phased out the guarantee feature on July 5, 2016. It no longer appears on the company website, advertising or promotion.\n\nAccording to Annalee Newitz, Editor-in-Chief of Gizmodo, who has analyzed the 2015 leaked data, Ashley Madison had over 70,000 bots sending fake female messages to male users. She had previously released an analysis purporting to show that only a minuscule proportion (12,000 out of 5.5 million) registered female accounts were used on a regular basis, but she has subsequently disavowed this analysis, saying that from the data released there is no way of determining how many women actually used the service.\n\nNewitz noted a clause in the terms of service which states that \"many profiles are for 'amusement only'\".\n\nIn 2012, a former employee claimed in a lawsuit that she was requested to create thousands of fake female accounts attractive to male customers, resulting in repetitive stress injury. The case settled out of court.\n\nIn July 2016, CEO Rob Segal and newly appointed President James Millership told Reuters that the company had phased out bots by late 2015. Segal shared an independent report by EY (Ernst & Young) which verified the phase-out.\n\nAshley Madison employs guerrilla marketing techniques to advertise its site. One such technique has been the creation of fake criticism websites filled with ads for Ashley Madison and anonymous testimony that the site is legitimate. For example, the site \"www.AshleyMadisonScams.com\" was registered to Ashley Madison owner Avid Life.\n\nAshley Madison advertises with TV commercials, billboards, and radio ads by the CEO, Noel Biderman. TV ads, described as cringe-worthy, have been pulled from the air in some countries after frequent complaints. Some proposals turned down by the companies approached include a €1.5 million jersey sponsorship deal with Italian basketball club Virtus Roma, a $10 million offer to rename Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport and an offer for the naming rights of New Meadowlands Stadium.\n\nA statement denouncing proposed ads was made in 2009 when Ashley Madison attempted to purchase C$200,000 worth of advertising from the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) on the Toronto streetcar system. With five of six committee members voting against it, the commissioner stated \"When it's a core fundamental value around cheating or lying, we're not going to let those kinds of ads go on.\" Biderman offered to subsidize the TTC fare rate to $2.50 from $2.75 but the offer was declined.\n\nAlso in 2009, NBC refused an ad submitted by Ashley Madison for the network's broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII.\n\nIn 2012, the company was sued by former employee Doriana Silva, who stated that in preparation for the launch of the company's Portuguese-language website, she was assigned to create over a thousand bogus member profiles within a three-week period in order to attract paying customers, and that this caused her to develop repetitive stress injury. The lawsuit claimed that as a result Silva \"developed severe pain in her wrists and forearms,\" and has been unable to work since 2011. The company countersued, alleging fraud. The company claimed that Silva had been photographed jet-skiing, an activity that was unlikely for someone who had suffered serious injury to the hands and forearms. Ashley Madison later alleged further that Silva had kept confidential documents and sought to retrieve them.\n\nIn 2015, the Ontario Superior Court dismissed the case without costs, a result with which Avi Weisman, vice-president and general counsel for Avid Life Media, said the company was \"very pleased.\"\n\nIn August 2015, after its customer records were leaked by hackers, a $576 million class-action lawsuit was filed against the company.\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the site was hacked by a group known as \"The Impact Team\". Claiming that its security had always been weak, the hackers claimed to have stolen personal information about the site's user base, and threatened to release names, home addresses, search histories and credit card numbers if the site was not immediately shut down. The demand was driven by the site's policy of not deleting users' personal information following their invoiced requests.\n\nThe first release, validated by experts, occurred on August 18. Another release was made on August 20, but a 13 GB file – which allegedly contained the emails of Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman – was corrupted. This was corrected on August 21, when the Impact Team dumped Biderman's emails in a separate 19 GB file.\n\nSome users reported receiving extortion emails requesting 1.05 in bitcoins (exactly C$300) to prevent the information from being shared with the user's significant other. Clinical psychologists argued that dealing with an affair in a particularly public way increases the hurt for spouses and children. On August 24 the Toronto Police Department spoke of \"two unconfirmed reports of suicides\" associated with the leak of customer profiles along with extortion attempts, offering a $500,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the hackers. At least one suicide previously linked to Ashley Madison has since been reported as being due to \"stress entirely related to issues at work that had no connection to the data leak\".\n\nCEO Rob Segal said in an interview with the \"Wall Street Journal\" that the company is making ongoing investments to enhance privacy and security safeguards, including a partnership with Deloitte's cyber security team. Segal also announced new discreet payment options, including Skrill, Neteller and Paysafe card.\n\n"}

It is based on Bhojpuri with influences from Awadhi. These were spoken by indentured laborers who came as immigrants to the Caribbean from the Indian subcontinent. It is closely related to Fijian Hindi, the Bhojpuri spoken in Mauritius and the Hindustani spoken in South Africa.\n\nBecause a majority of people came from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand, Caribbean Hindustani is most influenced by Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Braj Bhasha, and other Bihari dialects. It has a very minor influence from Tamil, Telugu, and other Dravidian languages. It has also borrowed a large number of words from Dutch in Suriname and other Dutch colonies, and English and French in former British colonies and French colonies. A large number of words, unique to Caribbean Hindustani, have been created to cater for the new environment that Indo-Caribbeans now live in. \n\nCaribbean Hindustani is the \"lingua franca\" of most Indo-Caribbeans, although Tamil and Telugu are the \"lingua francas\" for Indians in French Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe; where a majority of the Indians are of Dravidian (South Indian) descent.\n\nLike the Hindustani spoken in the Indian subcontinent, Caribbean Hindustani is broken up into Caribbean Hindi and Caribbean Urdu. Hindustani refers to both Hindi and Urdu. Hindi is spoken by Hindus and people of Hindu descent, whereas Urdu is spoken by Muslims and people of Muslim descent. Hindi has more influence from Sanskrit, while Urdu has more influence from Arabic and Persian. Hindi is written in the Devanagari, Devanagari Braille, and Kaithi script, whereas Urdu is written in the Perso-Arabic script and Urdu Braille, although in more recent times they both are written in the Latin script and English Braille. \n\nChutney music, chutney soca, chutney parang, baithak gana, folk music, classical music, some Hindu religious songs, some Muslim religious songs, and some Christian religious songs are sung in Caribbean Hindustani, sometimes being mixed with English in the Anglophone Caribbean or Dutch in Suriname and the Dutch Caribbean.\n\nThe Caribbean Hindustani of Guyana is known as \"Aili Gaili\" (Aaye-Gaye [I] Came-Gone is spoken as Aili-Gaili in Bhojpuri, Maithili and Awadhi and almost all dialects of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand (meaning broken or corrupted language) or \"Guyanese Hindustani\" and is spoken by some members in a community of 300,000 Indo-Guyanese.\n\nThe variant that used to be spoken in Trinidad and Tobago is known as \"Trinidadian Hindustani\" or \"Trinidadian Bhojpuri\". There is about 26,000 speakers.\n\n\"Sarnami Hindustani\" meaning \"Surinamese Hindustani\" is the most widely spoken language in Suriname after Dutch and Sranan Tongo, the two \"lingua francas\".

It is mainly spoken by and within Suriname’s Indo-Surinamese (cca. 27% of the population) community and therefore it is not considered to be a third lingua franca.\n\n\"Baithak Gana\" is the most famous form of the song being sung in Sarnami Hindustani.\n"}
{"id": "11020713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11020713", "title": "Classical Realism", "text": "Classical Realism\n\nClassical Realism refers to an artistic movement in late-20th and early 21st century in which drawing and painting place a high value upon skill and beauty, combining elements of 19th-century neoclassicism and realism.\n\nThe term \"Classical Realism\" first appeared as a description of literary style, as in an 1882 criticism of Milton's poetry. Its usage relating to the visual arts dates back to at least 1905 in a reference to Masaccio's paintings. It originated as the title of a contemporary but traditional artistic movement with Richard Lack (1928–2009), who was a pupil of Boston artist R. H. Ives Gammell (1893–1981) during the early 1950s. Ives Gammell had studied with William McGregor Paxton (1869–1941) and Paxton had studied with 19th-century French artist, Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904). In 1967 Lack established Atelier Lack, a studio-school of fine art patterned after the ateliers of 19th-century Paris and the teaching of the Boston impressionists. By 1980 he had trained a significant group of young painters. In 1982, they organized a traveling exhibition of their work and that of other artists within the artistic tradition represented by Gammell, Lack and their students. Lack was asked by Vern Swanson, director of the Springville Museum of Art, Springville, Utah, (the exhibition's originating venue), to coin a term that would differentiate the realism of the heirs of the Boston tradition from that of other representational artists. Although he was reluctant to label this work, Lack chose the expression \"Classical Realism.\" It was first used in the title of that exhibition: \"Classical Realism: The Other Twentieth Century\". The term, \"Classical Realism\", was originally intended to describe work that combined the fine drawing and design of the European academic tradition as exemplified by Gérôme with the observed color values of the American Boston tradition as exemplified by Paxton.\n\nIn 1985 Atelier Lack began publishing the \"Classical Realism Quarterly\", featuring articles written by Richard Lack and his students to educate and inform the public about traditional representational painting. In 1988 Lack and several associates founded The American Society of Classical Realism, a society organized to preserve and promote fine representational art. The ASCR functioned until 2005 and published the influential \"Classical Realism Journal\" and \"Classical Realism Newsletter.\"\n\nIn a separate vein, another major contributor to the revival of traditional drawing and painting knowledge is the painter and art instructor Ted Seth Jacobs (born 1927), who taught students at the Art Students League and the New York Academy of Art in New York City. Their lineage is rooted in the Académie Julian, the Golden Age of Illustration in New York, and the School of Paris. In 1987 Ted Seth Jacobs created his own art school, L'Ecole Albert Defois in Les Cerqueux sous Passavant, France (49). Many of Jacobs' students such as Anthony Ryder and Jacob Collins became influential teachers and acquired their own student following.\n\nClassical Realism is characterized by love for the visible world and the great traditions of Western art, including Classicism, Realism and Impressionism. The movement's aesthetic is Classical in that it exhibits a preference for order, beauty, harmony and completeness; it is Realist because its primary subject matter comes from the representation of nature based on the artist's observation. Artists in this genre strive to draw and paint from the direct observation of nature, and eschew the use of photography or other mechanical aids. In this regard, Classical Realism differs from the art movements of Photorealism and Hyperrealism. Stylistically, classical realists employ methods used by both Impressionist and Academic artists.\n\nClassical Realist painters have attempted to restore curricula of training that develop a sensitive, artistic eye and methods of representing nature that pre-date Modern Art. They seek to create paintings that are personal, expressive, beautiful, and skillful. Their subject matter includes all of the traditional categories within Western Art: figurative, landscape, portraiture, indoor and outdoor genre and still life paintings.\n\nA central idea of Classical Realism is the belief that the Modern Art movements of the 20th century opposed the tenets and production of traditional art and caused a general loss of the skills and methods needed to produce it. Modernism was antagonistic to art as it was conceived by the Greeks, resurrected in the Renaissance, and carried on by the academies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Classical Realist artists attempt to revive the idea of art production as it was traditionally understood: mastery of a craft in order to make objects that gratify and ennoble those who see them. This craftsmanship is then applied to drawing, painting or sculpting contemporary subjects which the artist observes in the modern world.\n\nLike the 19th-century academic models from which it derives inspiration, the movement has drawn criticism for the premium placed upon technical performance, a tendency toward contrived and idealized depictions of the figure, and rhetorical overstatement when applied to epic narrative. Maureen Mullarkey of the \"New York Sun\" referred to the school as \"a contemporary style with retro appeal—like Chrysler's PT Cruiser\".\n\nThe Classical Realist movement is currently sustained through art schools based on the Atelier Method. Many present-day academies and ateliers follow the Charles Bargue drawing course. Richard Lack is generally regarded as the founder of the contemporary atelier movement. His school, Atelier Lack, was founded in 1969 and became a model for similar schools. These modern ateliers are founded with the goal of revitalizing art education by reintroducing rigorous training in traditional drawing and painting techniques, employing teaching methodologies that were used in the École des Beaux-Arts. These schools pass on a method of instruction which melds formal academic art training with the influence of the French Impressionists.\n\nUnder the atelier model, art students study in the studio of an established master to learn how to draw and paint with realistic accuracy and an emphasis on rendering form convincingly. The foundation of these programs rests on an intensive study of the human figure, renderings of plaster casts of classical sculpture, and the emulation of their instructors. The goal is to make students adept at observation, theory, and craft while absorbing classical ideals of beauty.\n\nAtelier schools founded in this tradition include (in chronological order of founding): \n\n\n\n"}

When the Great Powers agreed on ten days of ceasefire (3–13 September 1876), Russian general and Commander of the Serbian Army Mikhail Chernyayev, who opposed peace with the Ottomans, went on 4 September to General Kosta Protić and asked him to declare the proclamation of a kingdom to the Army. The Army immediately swore Oath to \"King Milan\". The Great Powers opposed, and Prince Milan informed Chernyayev that he could not accept the declaration; Chernyayev replied that he was to leave with all Russian military if it was not accepted. Chernyayev assured that the recognition by the Great Powers was unnecessary, that the proclamation of kingdom raises the morale of the army and Serbian people, because \"a kingdom means independence\". It was compensation for the victims and the main profit of the war, which in his view, should continue after the truce for two months. He claimed that during that time, Russia would provide greater assistance to Serbia than even necessary. Prince Milan, pressured by the Great Powers, stated that he would not accept the proclamation. Chernyayev gave up on his threats, however, in order to save his reputation, the Prince's decision was not informed to the Morava–Timok Army. On 16 September a Serbian offensive began and failed, after which Chernyayev left Serbia and the Great Powers took on the initiative in Constantinople to suspend the war.\n\n"}

In recent years, however, Iran's birth rate has dropped significantly. Studies project that Iran's rate of population growth will continue to slow until it stabilizes above 100 million by 2050. More than half of Iran's population is under 35 years old (2012).\n\nIn 2009, the number of households stood at 15.3 million (4.8 persons per household). Families earn some 11.8 million rials (about $960) per month on average (2012).\n\nAccording to the OECD/World Bank statistics population growth in Iran from 1990 to 2008 was 17.6 million and 32%. The literacy rate was 80% in 2007, and 85% in 2008.\n\nAccording to the 2016 population census the population of Iran was 79.9 million, a fourfold increase since 1956. Between 1976 and 1986, an average annual population growth of almost 4% was reached, but due to decreasing fertility levels the growth decreased to 1.2% between 2011 and 2016.\n\nStructure of the population 2006 and 24.10.2011 (Census):\n\nTable 9 – Population and Average Annual Growth by Provinces: 2006 and 2011\n\n1 The population of the provinces of Alborz and Tehran for 2006 and their average annual growth have been calculated based on the data of 2011.\n\nUnofficial Translation 17\n\nTable 10 – Population Percentages by Province: 2006 and 2011 (Percentage)\n\n1 The population of the provinces of Alborz and Tehran for 2006 and their average annual growth have been calculated based on the data of 2011.\n\nThe largest linguistic group comprises speakers of Iranian languages, like modern Persian, Kurdish, Gilaki, Mazandarani, Luri, Talysh, and Balochi. Speakers of Turkic languages, most notably Azerbaijanis, which is by far the second-most spoken language in the country, but also the Turkmen, and the Qashqai peoples, comprise a substantial minority. The remainder are primarily speakers of Semitic languages such as Arabic and Assyrian. There are small groups using other Indo-European languages such as Armenian, Russian, Pashto; Georgian (a member of the Kartvelian language family), spoken in a large pocket only by those Iranian Georgians that live in Fereydan, Fereydunshahr. Most of those Georgians who live in the north Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Tehran Province and the rest of Iran no longer speak the language but keep a Georgian conscience.\nThe Circassians in Iran, a very large minority in the past and speakers of the Circassian language, have been strongly assimilated and absorbed within the population in the past few centuries. However, significant pockets do exist spread over the country, and they are the second-largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation after the Georgians.\n\nJews have had a continuous presence in Iran since the time of Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire. In 1948, there were approximately 140,000–150,000 Jews living in Iran. According to the Tehran Jewish Committee, the Jewish population of Iran was (more recently) estimated at about 25,000 to 35,000, of which approximately 15,000 are in Tehran with the rest residing in Hamadan, Shiraz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Yazd, Kerman, Rafsanjan, Borujerd, Sanandaj, Tabriz and Urmia. However, the official 2011 state census recorded only 8,756 Jews in Iran.\n\nThe CIA World Factbook (which is based on 2013 statistics) gives the following numbers for the languages spoken in Iran today: Persian, Luri, Gilaki and Mazandarani 66%; Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages 18%; Kurdish 10%; Arabic 2%; Baloch 2%; others 1% (Armenian, Georgian, Circassian, Assyrian, etc.).\n\nOther sources, such as the Library of Congress, and the Encyclopedia of Islam (Leiden) give Iran's ethnic groups as following: Persians 65%, Azerbaijanis 16%, Kurds 7%, Lurs 6%, Arabs 2%, Baloch 2%, Turkmens 1%, Turkic tribal groups (e.g. Qashqai) 1%, and non-Persian, non-Turkic groups (e.g. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians, Basseri ) less than 1%. For sources prior to and after 2000, see Languages and ethnicities in Iran.\n\nIn addition to its international migration pattern, Iran also exhibits one of the steepest urban growth rates in the world according to the UN humanitarian information unit. According to 2015 population estimates, approximately 73.4 percent of Iran's population lives in urban areas, up from 27 percent in 1950. Changes in urbanization law and regulations eased the urbanization process of rural areas, which created more than 400 cities only in the period of 1996-2005.\n\nThe following is a list of the six most populous cities in the country:\n\nAbout 99% of the Iranians are Muslims; 90% belong to the Shi'a branch of Islam, the official state religion, and about 9% belong to the Sunni branch, which predominates in neighboring Muslim countries. Less than 1% non-Muslim minorities include Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, Bahá'ís, Mandeans, and Yarsan. By far the largest group of Christians in Iran are Armenians under the Armenian Apostolic Church which has between 110,000, 250,000, and 300,000, adherents. There are hundreds of Christian churches in Iran. The Bahá'í Faith, Iran's largest non-Muslim religious minority with a population around 300,000, is not officially recognized (and therefore not included in the census results), and has been persecuted during its existence in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution of Bahá'ís has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education and employment. Unofficial estimates for the Assyrian Christian population range between 20,000, and 70,000. The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 and 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press. Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.\n\nThe term \"Iranian citizens abroad\" or \" Iranian/Persian diaspora\" refers to the Iranian people born in Iran and their children but living outside of Iran. Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than two billion dollars home in 2006.\n\nAs of 2010, there are about four to five million Iranians living abroad, mostly in the United States, Canada, Europe, Persian Gulf States, Turkey, Australia and the broader Middle East. According to the 2000 Census and other independent surveys, there are an estimated 1 million Iranian-Americans living in the U.S., in particular, the Los Angeles area is estimated to be host to approximately 72,000 Iranians, earning the Westwood area of LA the nickname Tehrangeles. Other metropolises that have large Iranian populations include Dubai with 300,000 Iranians, Vancouver, London, Toronto, San Francisco Bay Area, Washington D.C., Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Stockholm, Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt. Their combined net worth is estimated to be $1.3 trillion.\n\nNote that this differs from the other Iranian peoples living in other areas of Greater Iran, who are of related ethnolinguistical family, speaking languages belonging to the Iranian languages which is a branch of Indo-European languages.\n\nIran hosts one of the largest refugee population in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan (80%) and Iraq (10%). Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation. Between 1979 and 1997, UNHCR spent more than US$1 billion on Afghan refugees in Pakistan but only $150 million on those in Iran. In 1999, the Iranian government estimated the cost of maintaining its refugee population at US$10 million per day, compared with the US$18 million UNHCR allocated for all of its operations in Iran in 1999. As of 2016, some 300,000 work permits have been issued for foreign nationals in Iran.\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nAge structure\n\nMedian age\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\nBirth rate\n\nDeath rate\n\nUrbanization\n\nSex ratio\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\nYouth literacy\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, the Iranian Y-chromosome pool is as follows where haplogroups, R1 (25%), J2 (23%) G (14%), J1 (8%) E1b1b (5%), L (4%), \nQ (4%), comprise more than 85% of the total chromosomes.\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Iranian mitochondrial DNA shows more Western Eurasian lineages than the Y-DNA lineages. Nonetheless, a West Eurasian MtDNA makes up over 90% of the Iranian population on average. (2013).\n\nAmong them, U3b3 lineages appear to be restricted to populations of Iran and the Caucasus, while the sub-cluster U3b1a is common in the whole Near East region.\n\nIn Iran outliers in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA gene pool are consisted by the north Iranian ethnicities, such as the Gilaki's and Mazandarani's, who's genetic build up including chromosomal DNA are nearly identical to the major South Caucasian ethnicites, namely the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani's. Other outliers are made by the Baloch people, representing a mere 1-2% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines leaning towards northwest South Asian ethnic groups.\n\nLevels of genetic variation in Iranian populations are comparable to the other groups from the Caucasus, Anatolia and Europe.\n\nThe \"Tats\" are an Iranian people, presently living within Azerbaijan and Russia (mainly Southern Dagestan). The Tats are part of the indigenous peoples of Iranian origin in the Caucasus.\n\nTats use the Tat language, a southwestern Iranian language and a variety of Persian Azerbaijani and Russian are also spoken. Tats are mainly Shia Muslims, with a significant Sunni Muslim minority. Likely the ancestors of modern Tats settled in South Caucasus when the Sassanid Empire from the 3rd to 7th centuries built cities and founded military garrisons to strengthen their positions in this region.\n\nThe Parsis are the close-knit Zoroastrian community based primarily in India but also found in Pakistan. Parsis are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent over 1,000 years ago. Indian census data (2001) records 69,601 Parsis in India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai (previously known as Bombay). There are approximately 8,000 Parsis elsewhere on the subcontinent, with an estimated 2,500 Parsis in the city of Karachi and approximately 50 Parsi families in Sri Lanka. The number of Parsis worldwide is estimated to be fewer than 100,000 (Eliade, 1991:254).\n\nIn Pakistan and India, the term \"Irani\" has come to denote Iranian Zoroastrians who have migrated to Pakistan and India within the last two centuries, as opposed to most Parsis who arrived in India over 1000 years ago. Many of them moved during the Qajar era, when persecution of Iranian Zoroastrians was rampant. They are culturally and linguistically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran. Unlike the Parsis, they speak a Dari dialect, the language spoken by the Iranian Zoroastrians in Yazd and Kerman. Their last names often resemble modern Iranian names, however Irani is a common surname among them. In India they are mostly located in modern-day Mumbai while in Pakistan they are mostly located in modern-day Karachi. In both Pakistan and India, they are famous for their restaurants and tea-houses. Some, such as Ardeshir Irani, have also become very famous in cinema.\n\nThe \"Ajam\" are an ethnic community of Bahrain, of Iranian origin. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of Manama and Muharraq. The Iranians who adhere to Shiite sect of Islam are Ajam, and they are different from the Huwala. Ajams are also a large percentage of the populace in UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.\n\nIn addition to this, many names of ancient villages in Bahrain are of Persian origin. It is believed that these names were given during the Safavid rule of Bahrain (1501–1722). i.e. Karbabad, Salmabad, Karzakan, Duraz, Barbar, which indicates that the history of Ajams is much older.\n\nHuwala are the descendants of Persians and Persian Arabs who belong to the Sunni sect of Islam. Huwala migrated from Ahvaz in Iran to the Persian Gulf in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.\n\n\n"}

The club has been involved in East Los Angeles College, and it has also made contributions to the school as well as the surrounding community. \nThe mission of ESSP is to assist students of East Los Angeles College to realize their potential in successfully transferring to four year universities. ESSP raises funds to create scholarship for students. In addition ESSP has established an irrevocable sense of pride in the school and in the greater community, focusing on East Los Angeles. In addition, ESSP seeks to instill a strong sense of self-esteem in students who have had to overcome great obstacles to attend college. \nProfessor Dennis Sanchez, an alumnus of the University of Southern California and San Francisco State University found his occupational satisfaction in coming to East Los Angeles College and serving as an English professor because he wanted to give back to the community. He felt that students in ELAC were equally diligent as students at other community colleges, yet they were compelled by their circumstances to overcome much more adversity and sorrows. Therefore, he established East Side Spirit and Pride so that students of the college could develop a veracious sense of pride in their community and heritage.\n\nEast Side Spirit and Pride was a major advocate for the restoration football team at ELAC when football had been eliminated due to budgetary constraints.\n\nProfessor Sanchez along with the East Side Spirit and Pride members instigated the idea of the creation of a marching band,\n\nToday, East Side Spirit and Pride involves dozens of students, faculty, and staff every semester. In addition, ESSP has a board of directors of nineteen members most of whom are former ESSP members as well as graduates of East Los Angeles College. The club holds regular meetings on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. ESSP also regularly features motivational speakers, generally former students of East Los Angeles College who have now graduated from four year universities and sometimes local celebrities, including Chase Masterson, actress, Luis J. Rodriguez, a Mexican-American native of East Los Angeles and famous author of the book \"\", and congresswoman Judy Chu both honored at ESSP's annual scholarship dinner.\n\nThe club also routinely hosts tours to various neighboring universities, such as Cal State Dominguez Hills, Cal State Fullerton, Cal State Los Angeles, UCLA, USC, Occidental and Loyola Marymount University, where students have the opportunity to frequent campus grounds and explore possible options for their higher education.\n\nEast Side Spirit and Pride also has weekly readings, known as \"Great Moments in Literature\", where professors and students read and openly discuss and analyze the meanings of various literary works, many by renowned authors and poets such as Robert Frost, Ernest Hemingway, Emily Dickinson, William Shakespeare, and E. A. Robinson.\n\nThe club also has interactive and informative discussions concerning procedures and important things-to-know relating to transferring to four-year universities in California, primarily the UCs, CSUs, and private universities such as USC.\nThe club consists of over fifty members, a board of directors of nineteen members, an associate board, a faculty/staff committee as well as chapters of trustees throughout Southern California. The club has welcomed UCLA graduate and English professor Nancy Ramirez as co-sponsor of the club. Also joining ESSP are parents and players from West Hills Baseball, CA, who have partnered to help with the ESSP scholarship dinner and golf tournament to help raise funds for ELAC students.\n\nOn March 15, 2014, a fundraising event will be sponsored by East Side Spirit and Pride, featuring special guest, Edward James Olmos, alumni of East Los Angeles College and Academy Award nominee for his role in \"Stand and Deliver\".\n\nIn 2010, East Side Spirit and Pride partnered up with Father Greg Boyle and Homeboy Industries in an attempt to reach out to the surrounding community. Professor Dennis Sanchez teaches a class called Bridge to College at Homeboy Industries on a routine basis in addition to having ESSP members tutor members of Homeboy Industry. In addition he takes members from Homeboy Industries on tours to East Los Angeles College and other colleges in the Los Angeles area. As a result, many students from Homeboy Industry have enrolled at East Los Angeles College and other community colleges in the greater Los Angeles area. Proceeds from the ESSP Annual Scholarship Dinner and its lunch and golf tournament go to fund educational scholarships and grants for members of Homeboy Industries and other at-risk members of the community.\n\n"}
{"id": "14368225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14368225", "title": "Environmentalism in music", "text": "Environmentalism in music\n\nEnvironmentalism has occasionally been a topic in music, primarily since the 1940s. However, the earliest songs including environmentalist topics can be traced back to the 19th century, earliest of which is \"Woodman! Spare that Tree!\" by George Pope Morris and Henry Russell. Ecomusicologists (musicologists and ethnomusicologists focusing on music and environmental issues) and music educators are increasingly emphasizing the intersections of music and nature, and musicking for ecological activism.\n\nThis topic was significantly more relevant in music in the '40s after World War II and has continually progressed over time. There are many artists across the world that advocate environmentalism such as the Barenaked Ladies, Bonnie Raitt, Cloud Cult, Dave Matthews Band, Don Henley, Drake, Green Day, Guster, Jack Johnson, KT Tunstall, Metallica, Moby, Pearl Jam, Perry Farrell, Phish. The Roots, Sarah Harmer, Sheryl Crow, Thom Yorke, Willie Nelson, and many others.\n\nIn addition to being a topic of music, Environmentalism has been increasingly prevalent among artists and the music industry itself. An example is the push for CDs to be packaged in cardboard rather than plastic. Also, many music festivals such as Bonnaroo make significant efforts to be sustainable.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s a growing amount of popular music inspired by the counterculture movement reflected anti-war sentiments of peace and harmony. \"Big Yellow Taxi\" by Joni Mitchell was a song about environmental degradation with lyrics such as \"They paved Paradise, put up a parking lot\". Her reference to DDT in the song is a reflection of the times as Rachel Carson's 1962 book \"Silent Spring\" had brought the dangers of DDT into the spotlight. John Denver, a country and folk singer often sang about the wilderness of Colorado with popular songs such as \"Rocky Mountain High\" and \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\".\n\nBlack Sabbath's song \"War Pigs\" is an anti-war song that was extremely influential to young Americans across the nation. Many consider the wave of environmentalism in the era to be the foundation of metal music in the world. A song titled \"Blackened\" by Metallica is another song that supports environmentalism as is said in the lyrics \"Blackened is the end, winter it will send, throwing all you see, into obscurity.\" This song says that if war and rampage continue, the earth around us will die. Environmentalism is still prevalent today as it continues to shape our way of life and forms of music.\n\nIn 1995 singer Michael Jackson came out with the hit \"Earth Song\" which was about environmental and animal welfare. The production of the music video had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution, poverty and war. Jackson and the world's people unite in a spiritual chant—\"Earth Song\"—which summons a force that heals the world. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, war ends, and the forests regrow. The video closes with a request for donations to Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. The clip was shown infrequently in the United States.\n\nIn 2007, a massive concert entitled Live Earth (2007 concert) was held across the world to raise awareness and provoke action on climate change. Smaller concerts with similar themes have also been held around the world. An example is the Earth Music Festival which was held in Australia in 2010.\n\nIn 2009 Disney created a campaign called Disney's Friends for Change which helped to promote an environmental message. A song called Send it On recorded by Disney singers Miley Cyrus, Demi Lovato, the Jonas Brothers and Selena Gomez was produced and the profits donated to environmental charity organizations. The song debuted at number nine on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs which led to it making into the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, issue dated August 29, 2009. \"Send It On\" debuted and peaked at number twenty in the Hot 100. It then fell to number twenty-one, and stayed on for three more weeks before falling off.\n\nA rock club in New York City called Wetlands Preserve served as both a performance venue and a hub for environmentalist activism from 1989-2001.\n\nAfter a radioactive isotope (Strontium-90) was found in cows milk in 1959, the concern for the environmental effects of the nuclear arms race increased exponentially. This sparked songs about the invisibility of environmental effects like radioactive isotopes. In his song \"Mack the Bomb,\" Pete Seeger wrote a comparison between a shark and Strontium-90, explaining that the threat of a shark is at least visible, unlike radioactive isotopes. In 1962, Malvina Reynolds also wrote a song called \"What Have They Done to the Rain?\", which was inspired by above-ground nuclear testing, and how it was putting Strontium-90 into the air, then into soil through rain, which is how it got into cows and their milk. \n\nPete Seeger released what is considered the first environmentalist album, entitled \"God Bless the Grass\" in 1966. The 1960s produced a large amount of environmental-focused songs, primarily due to the popularization of folk music and the musicians that penned many environmental protest songs, in that genre. \n\nWhile composers have often used nature as their inspiration, the period since World War II has seen an ever increasing amount of music in this regard. Composers such as John Cage and Olivier Messiaen began using patterns in nature as their materials in Musical Composition. One example of Cage's use of environmental sounds is the piece Child of Tree. This work involves amplifying a cactus and pea pod shakers in addition to other instruments chosen by the performer.\nJohn Luther Adams writes music directly from his surroundings in Alaska. He is an environmentalist who has written and discussed the role that artists can play in combating Global Warming. An example of his music is the piece \"The Place Where You Go to Listen\". This work involves a sound and light installation that is \"controlled by natural events occurring in real time.\"\n\nThe Baltic Sea Festival was founded on the theme of preserving the environment. Countries surrounding the Baltic Sea are brought together to solve problems with the body of water. Music \"serves as a good platform\" in discussions of solutions which can only be solved jointly.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2110723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2110723", "title": "Fatted calf", "text": "Fatted calf\n\nFatted calf is a metaphor or symbol of festive celebration and rejoicing for someone's long-awaited return. It derives from the Parable of the Prodigal Son in the New Testament. In biblical times, people would often keep at least one piece of livestock that was fed a special diet to fatten it up, thus making it more flavorsome when prepared as a meal. Slaughtering this livestock was to be done on rare and special occasions. Thus when the prodigal son returns, the father \"kills the fatted calf\" to show that the celebration is out of the ordinary.\n\nIn modern usage, \"killing the fatted calf\" can simply mean to celebrate in an exuberant manner, as used in the Elton John song \"Bennie and the Jets\".\n\n"}
{"id": "398631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=398631", "title": "Final Fantasy X-2", "text": "Final Fantasy X-2\n\n\"Final Fantasy X-2\" set several precedents in the \"Final Fantasy\" series aside from being the first direct sequel in video game form and the second sequel in the franchise, after the anime \"\". It was the first game in the series to feature only three player characters, an all-female main cast, and early access to most of the game's locations. Additionally, it featured a variation of the character classes system—one of the series' classic gameplay concepts—and is one of the few games in the series to feature multiple endings. Finally, it was the first game in the series that did not have musical contributions in it from longtime composer Nobuo Uematsu.\n\nThe game was positively received by critics and was commercially successful. It sold 1.92 million copies in North America, and 5.29 million copies worldwide. \"Final Fantasy X-2\" was voted as the 32nd best game of all time by the readers of \"Famitsu\". The English version of the game won an award for \"Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance\" at the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in 2004. The game has attained a rating of 86% on GameRankings and an 85% rating on Metacritic. It was the final \"Final Fantasy\" game to be developed by Square before merging with Enix in April 2003. The game was re-released as a high-definition remaster for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, together with \"Final Fantasy X\", under the title \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\". It was also re-released for the PlayStation 4 in May 2015, Microsoft Windows in May 2016, and will be released on the Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019. Square Enix announced in 2013 that the \"Final Fantasy X\" series has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.\n\nThough a direct sequel to \"Final Fantasy X\", \"Final Fantasy X-2\" does not duplicate its predecessor's gameplay; instead, it innovates on traditional elements. Like pre-\"Final Fantasy X\" installments, characters \"level up\" after a certain number of battles, by gaining pre-determined stat bonuses. The conditional turn-based battle system in \"Final Fantasy X\" has been replaced by a faster-paced variation of the \"Final Fantasy\" series' traditional active time battle (ATB) system, which was originally designed by Hiroyuki Ito and first featured in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Whenever a random enemy is encountered, the ATB system is used. Under this enhanced version of the ATB, playable characters may interrupt an enemy while they are preparing to take action, instead of waiting for an enemy's turn to finish before attacking. Furthermore, it is possible for both characters and enemies to chain attacks together for greater damage.\n\nAnother departure from the gameplay of \"Final Fantasy X\" is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from early in the game, transported via the airship Celsius. This is a deviation from the overall \"Final Fantasy\" series, where the most efficient means of transportation is typically not obtained until late in the game.\n\nThese two changes allow players to choose a less linear storyline. Unlike \"Final Fantasy X\", in which a player's course through the game's world was largely straightforward, \"Final Fantasy X-2\" is almost entirely free form. The game consists of five chapters, with each location featuring one scenario per chapter. Put together, the five scenarios in one locale form a subplot of the game, called an \"Episode\". Only a few scenarios per chapter are integral to the game's central plot, and are marked on the world navigation system as \"Hotspots\" (\"Active Links\" in the Japanese version). By accessing only Hotspots, a player can quickly proceed through the game's story without participating in sidequests.\n\nThe game keeps track of the player's completed percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% of the game is completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.\n\nThe field-map navigation system is largely unchanged from \"Final Fantasy X\"; it is still dominantly three dimensional with mostly continuous locations. A few upgrades have been implemented, providing the player with extended interaction with the environment through jumping, climbing and rotating camera angles.\n\nThe game's sidequests include minor tasks and quests, optional bosses and dungeons, and the most minigames of any \"Final Fantasy\" at the time of its release. These minigames include Gunner's Gauntlet (a third-person/first-person shooter game) and Sphere Break (a mathematical coin game involving addition and multiplication), as well as the fictional underwater sport blitzball originally featured in \"Final Fantasy X\" with a different control scheme. Director Motomu Toriyama has explained that one of the concepts at issue during development was providing a large variety of minigames, such that \"if you bought \"Final Fantasy X-2\" you wouldn't need any other game\".\n\n\"Final Fantasy X-2\" reintroduces the series' classic character class system (seen previously in \"Final Fantasy III\", \"Final Fantasy V\" and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\") through the inclusion of dresspheres. Because the party never grows beyond three characters, switching characters during battle is unnecessary. Instead, the player can switch character classes, providing access to different abilities. The playable characters are allowed to equip one dressphere at a time, each providing different battle functions and abilities. Characters can learn new skills for each dressphere with the use of Ability Points (AP). AP is obtained by defeating enemies and by the use of items and abilities for that sphere. Abilities to be learned are chosen in the main menu. During battle, AP is given to that ability until it is learned. Each character can access as many as six dresspheres at a time, depending on the specific properties of the Garment Grid they are wearing. The Garment Grid is a placard featuring a geometric shape connected by nodes. These nodes are slots that can be filled with dresspheres, allowing characters to change character classes during their turn in battle. Most Garment Grids possess Gates that when passed through grant the user a complimentary buff.\n\nAs with equipped items, Garment Grids often provide characters with a variety of enhancements and extra abilities. The game features diverse Garment Grids and dresspheres which can be discovered as the game progresses. While normal dresspheres can be used by all three playable characters, each character can acquire a dressphere that only they can use. These dresspheres can only be activated after a character has changed into all of the classes designated to her Garment Grid in a single battle. When a character activates one of these dresspheres, the other characters are replaced by two controllable support units.\n\nLike the preceding game, \"Final Fantasy X-2\" is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but previously disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the \"unsent\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"fiends\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. While the setting of the original \"Final Fantasy X\" was decidedly somber, in \"Final Fantasy X-2\", the main characters were fitted with a jovial \"Charlie's Angels\"-like motif. Whereas \"Final Fantasy X\" drew heavily on ancient Japanese culture and Asian settings, \"Final Fantasy X-2\" incorporated a number of elements from modern Japanese pop culture.\n\nAesthetically, the world of Spira is essentially unchanged in the two years since \"Final Fantasy X\", and many locations return from the game. There are, however, major changes in the ideology of Spira's people. After Sin's defeat came the arrival of an era known as \"the Eternal Calm\". The priests of the Yevon religion chose to expose the truth about the order, leaving the population to decide for themselves how to live in a world without that religion and without Sin. Advanced technology and the Al Bhed are now embraced by the population as a whole, which has begun to pursue leisures such as attending musical concerts and participating in the sport of blitzball. Others have become hunters of ancient treasures, ranging from coins and machinery to spheres in forgotten caves and ruins. Those who pursue the latter are known as \"sphere hunters\", of which many groups have formed.\n\nIn the absence of Yevon, new groups have formed. Young people were especially quick to abandon Yevon and embrace machinery, while many of the older generation felt that cultural changes were happening too quickly. The most influential of the new groups are the progressive Youth League, led by Mevyn Nooj and seeking a break from the past, the New Yevon Party, led by a former priest named \"Trema\" until his disappearance and later by Praetor Baralai, which seeks more gradual change, and the neutral Machina League, led by Gippal. By the start of the game, there are rising tensions between the Youth League and New Yevon factions. Both groups have sought out High Summoner Yuna's support, who has instead joined a sphere hunter group with her cousin in hopes of finding a way to bring back Tidus, her lost love who vanished during the ending of \"Final Fantasy X\".\n\nThe three main playable characters of \"Final Fantasy X-2\" are Yuna, Rikku and Paine, whose team is abbreviated in-game as \"YRP\" (\"YuRiPa\" in the original Japanese version). Yuna and Rikku reprise their roles from \"Final Fantasy X\", and, though their personalities are much the same as before, Square decided that their appearances would be heavily altered to give a greater impression of activity. Furthermore, it was decided that the pervading cultural changes occurring in \"Final Fantasy X\"s world as they and others began trying to live positively would be reflected in the new clothing of these two characters. The character of Paine is a new creation designed for inclusion in \"Final Fantasy X-2\", to accommodate the game's intended action-adventure style revolving around a trio of female characters. Her personality is far more cynical and emotionally distant than that of her teammates, and she keeps her past a secret from them for much of the game.\n\nSeveral other major and supporting characters from \"Final Fantasy X\" appear in the game. Additionally, other new characters are introduced in \"Final Fantasy X-2\", such as the faction leaders and the Leblanc Syndicate, a group of sphere hunters who serve as the Gullwings' rivals for much of the game. The game's main antagonist is Shuyin, another new character.\n\nTwo years after Sin's defeat, Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur. Meanwhile, the Gullwings discover an ancient sphere containing images of an enormous machina weapon called \"Vegnagun\" that was secretly buried beneath Bevelle. The weapon has enough power to threaten all of Spira, The Gullwings then join forces with the Leblanc Syndicate to investigate the underground areas of the city in an attempt to destroy the machine before it can be used by either side in the upcoming conflict. However, discovering a large tunnel recently dug into the floor of the weapon's chamber, they realize that Vegnagun has apparently moved to the Farplane, located at Spira's core.\n\nDisagreements between Spira's factions are soon punctuated further after the disappearance of Baralai, Nooj, and Gippal—the leaders of New Yevon, the Youth League and the Machine Faction respectively. Returning to the underground areas of Bevelle, the Gullwings discover the missing faction leaders discussing Vegnagun and learn that the machine's AI allows it to detect hostility and to respond by activating itself and fleeing. The player then learns that Paine had once been friends with all three men. Two years earlier in a cave beneath Mushroom Rock Road called \"the Den of Woe,\" just before the failed Operation Mi'ihen, the squad's final exercise was conducted. Within the cave, the various squad candidates were swarmed by pyreflies and driven to kill one another. The only survivors were Paine, Baralai, Gippal, and Nooj. Soon after, Nooj was possessed by Shuyin shot his surviving comrades and left them to die, severing the friendship the group had with one another. Before the four survivors could leave the cave, the spirit of Shuyin—requiring a host in order to interact with the world physically—had possessed Nooj, and later forced him to shoot his comrades.\n\nShuyin possesses Baralai's body, pursuing Vegnagun to the Farplane. Nooj and Gippal follow in pursuit, asking Yuna to keep things under control on the surface. Yuna falls into the Farplane and meets Shuyin, who mistakes her for a woman named \"Lenne\". Shuyin expresses his anger that Spira's citizens have not yet come to understand the heartache that war can cause, and plans to use Vegnagun to destroy all of Spira.\n\nThe player learns that 1000 years before the game, Shuyin was a famous blitzball player in the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, and the lover of a popular songstress and summoner—Lenne. Before he could use Vegnagun, Lenne begged him to stop. Shuyin yielded, but a group of Bevelle soldiers arrived a moment later and shot the couple. The Gullwings organize a concert to which everyone in Spira is invited, supporters of the Youth League and New Yevon alike. Additionally, the Songstress dressphere worn by Yuna is revealed to hold Lenne's memories, resulting in a sphere screen projecting them to everyone in attendance during the concert. Witnessing images of Shuyin and Lenne's last moments, Spira's citizens begin to understand the unproductive nature of their disagreements.\n\nAlthough the factional fighting has ceased, Shuyin has nearly carried out his plan to destroy Spira with Vegnagun. Joining forces with the Leblanc Syndicate once again, the Gullwings make their way to the Farplane and find Gippal and Nooj already battling Vegnagun. Subsequently, the fayth once located in Bevelle appears before Yuna and thanks her as well. He then asks her if she would like to see \"him\" again. If the player replies with \"Yes\", and a sufficient percentage of the game's optional storyline has been completed, the fayth locates Tidus's scattered pyreflies and sends them to Besaid, where they reform; thus, when Yuna returns home, she is reunited with Tidus. Players who achieve 100% completion in addition to reviving Tidus will see an additional reunion scene in Zanarkand where the pair discuss whether he is truly real or still a dream.\n\nDevelopment of \"Final Fantasy X-2\" began in late 2001 in response to the success of \"Final Fantasy X\", particularly fan reaction to the \"Eternal Calm\" video included in the Japanese version of \"Final Fantasy X International\". It was released in Japan shortly before the merger between Square and Enix. The game's eventual name, \"X-2\", was initially not liked by the production team, but it was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of \"X\" and thus could not be the next numbered title in the series. Kazushige Nojima, the previous game's writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. Something he was particularly averse to originally was the happy ending, which he felt was wrong for the story. The production team was one third the size of the previous installment. This was because the team was already familiar with the material and it allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. In designing the game, a significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs from \"Final Fantasy X\" were reused. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has explained that this allowed the game to be developed in one year and at half the normal scope \"Final Fantasy\" titles are normally produced. Maya and Softimage 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics.\n\nProducer Yoshinori Kitase and director Motomu Toriyama have explained that the objective in mind when designing \"Final Fantasy X-2\" was to embrace the concept of change as the game's theme and establish a more upbeat atmosphere than its predecessor. The reuse of the engine and locations from the original game meant that the team could spend most of their time focusing on the gameplay systems and plot. To portray the drastic change in Spira, the developers excluded summons, redesigned towns, and included vehicles. The low-flying vehicles were added to allow the player quicker access and mobility to the areas that were already available in the previous title.\n\nThe ending of \"Final Fantasy X\" meant that the Aeon summoning system from the game could not be used in the sequel, necessitating the team to make a new gameplay system. Because of the emphasis on a more optimistic setting, the game's dressphere system (inspired by the magical girl subgenre of anime and manga) was implemented, and the atmosphere of J-pop introduced right from the game's opening sequence. Additional allusions to popular culture in general were featured, such as the style of \"Charlie's Angels.\" The dressphere system, along with having a lead cast of three non-\"macho\" girls were intended to keep the tone of the game light and lively. Lulu was excluded from the lead cast because, in addition to being married, her presence would have given her an \"older sister\" role to Yuna, rather than letting Yuna take the lead on discovering herself on her own. Though work on the opening song and motion capture began early in development, the opening sequence was actually the last portion of the game to be completed.\n\nFor \"Final Fantasy X-2\", regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu was replaced by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi of \"The Bouncer\" fame. Among the game's more notable tracks are two vocalized songs: the J-pop-style \"Real Emotion\" and a more slowly-paced ballad, \"1000 Words\". The Japanese versions of the songs are sung by Kumi Koda, a Japanese music artist who also performed motion capture for the \"Real Emotion\" opening full motion video and provided the voice of Lenne in the Japanese version of the game. The English versions of the songs are sung by Jade Villalon of Sweetbox. She released extended versions of the songs she sang as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album, Adagio. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single \"Come with Me\". While similar, the lyrics of Koda Kumi's versions differ from those sung by Jade Villalon.\n\nAs with \"Final Fantasy X\", an expanded international version was produced for \"Final Fantasy X-2\". This version of the game, titled \"Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission\", introduces two new dresspheres, an additional \"Last Mission\" at a location called \"Yadonoki Tower,\" and the option to capture numerous monsters and characters including Tidus, Auron and Seymour from \"Final Fantasy X\"—as well as several supporting characters from both games—during battle. This version was never released outside Japan, although the English voices were used for the main story in the International version (not in the Last Mission). Due to this change, parts of the Japanese subtitles were changed or altered to fit the voice-overs. This was detailed in the official strategy book for the International version (see below). In 2005, a compilation featuring \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy X-2\" was released in Japan under the title \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 Ultimate Box\".\n\nSeveral action figures, books and soundtracks were released by Square Enix. Among the books that were published were three \"Ultimania\" guidebooks, a series of artbooks/strategy guides published by Square Enix in Japan. They feature original artwork from \"Final Fantasy X-2\", offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon many aspects of the game's storyline, and feature several interviews with the game's developers. There are three books in the series: \"Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania\", \"Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania Ω\", and \"Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission Ultimania\". A similar three-book series was produced for \"Final Fantasy X\".\n\nGaming peripheral company Hori produced PlayStation 2 controllers modeled after the Tiny Bee guns Yuna uses in \"Final Fantasy X-2\". These controllers were released only in Japan. They were re-released in a new silver box to coincide with the release of \"Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission\". They also released a vertical stand for the console with a \"Final Fantasy X-2\" logo that lights up in blue color when plugged into a powered console.\n\nOn September 13, 2011, Square Enix announced that \"Final Fantasy X\" would be re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, in celebration of the game's 10 year anniversary. Yet rumors spread that it would also include its sequel \"Final Fantasy X-2\" In January 2012, production of the game had started. Producer Yoshinori Kitase will once again be involved in the production of the game, wishing to work on its quality, yet again no confirmation yet of the inclusion of the sequel. On February 18, 2013 the first footage of the PlayStation Vita version of \"Final Fantasy X HD\" was released, showing off HD models of Tidus, Yuna, Bahamut and Yojimbo. On 19 March, it was confirmed that the PS3 version of the game would also include its sequel \"X-2\", and that it would also be remastered in HD and would be based on the International version. \"Final Fantasy X-2 Last Mission\" was later announced to be remastered in HD and included as well. The HD remastered games for the PS3 was released under the title \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\". The two games were sold separately on PlayStation Vita in Japan with \"Final Fantasy X HD Remaster\" to include \"Final Fantasy X HD Remaster\" and \"Final Fantasy X Eternal Calm HD Remaster\" and \"Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster\" to include \"Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster\" and \"Final Fantasy X-2 Last Mission HD Remaster\". They were sold together with a voucher to download \"Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster\" for free in regions outside Japan as well as in Japan. Square Enix launched an official website for the two HD remastered titles in March 2013. In 2014, it was announced that the remaster would be released for the PlayStation 4 in Spring 2015. It was later released for Windows in May 2016.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X-2\" sold over 1.94 million copies in Japan in 2003 as the highest-selling game of the year. Within nine months of its Japanese release, it sold more than a million copies in North America (within two months of its release there), and nearly four million copies worldwide. It went on to sell 2.11 million units in Japan, 1.85 million units in the United States, and more than 100,000 units in the United Kingdom. \"International + Last Mission\" sold over 288,000 copies in Japan over the course of 2004. In October 2013, Square Enix announced \"Final Fantasy X\" and its sequel \"Final Fantasy X-2\" have together sold over 14 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2.\n\nIt was voted as the 32nd best game of all time by readers of the Japanese video game magazine \"Famitsu\", which also gave it a 34 out of 40. The English release of \"Final Fantasy X-2\" won the Seventh Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award in 2004 for \"Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance\" in recognition of the character Rikku.\n\nMultimedia website IGN felt that the game's shift in tone is \"part of what makes [it] so intriguing,\" labeling the storyline \"a deep political drama\" that \"always manages to keep from taking things too seriously.\" They also commented that the game \"treats its history with intelligence\" and \"its returning characters...just as clever\". Further positive reaction came from RPGamer, with one staff reviewer summarizing \"X-2\" as \"a light-hearted fun game\" that \"may ... be the most enjoyable thing to come from the series in several years\", while another regarded its battle system as innovative and \"very simple to navigate\".\n\nThe game's stylistic changes from past \"Final Fantasy\" titles sparked negative comments, with some perceiving it as a change in the spirit of the franchise. Among these were the game's status as \"Final Fantasy\"s first direct sequel and the change from a tragic atmosphere in \"Final Fantasy X\" to a dominantly lighthearted tone in \"Final Fantasy X-2\". In their review, gaming website GameSpot commented that \"Some of the missions ... come off as downright silly and a bit tacked on\". Additionally, they felt that the game's non-linear style makes it \"[lack] the singular narrative thrust of \"Final Fantasy X\" or other typical RPGs, and the storyline can feel a little nebulous and disjointed as a result\". Moreover, GameSpot commented that \"trivial minigames have been creeping into the Final Fantasy games at an alarming rate over the last few years, and in this regard, \"X-2\" is definitely the most egregious offender in the series\". Despite these comments, they praised the battle system as a \"welcome addition\", while regarding its voice-overs and localizations as \"outstanding\".\n\nAnother aspect of the game that has attracted criticism is the reuse of graphical designs from \"Final Fantasy X\". One reviewer at RPGamer commented that \"there is little question that the graphics in \"Final Fantasy X-2\" could rival just about any other RPG on the market ... [but] one does \"not\" get ... [the impression] that the graphics have been improved in any significant way since \"Final Fantasy X\"\", while GameSpot said \"\"X-2\" doesn't look that much better than \"X\" did two years ago\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" regarded this reuse of code as \"[tripping up] in the one area where \"Final Fantasy\" titles usually shine\".\n\nThe game's soundtrack was met with mixed feelings, because \"Final Fantasy X-2\"s score was the first in the series without input from Nobuo Uematsu, composer of all previous games in the main series, and because of the change to a distinct J-pop atmosphere. While IGN commented that the music provided an \"appropriately fitting backdrop\" and 1UP.com suggested that it \"certainly is in keeping with the new flavor\", others, such as \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", regarded it as \"too bubbly.\" One staff member at RPGamer suggested that \"the absence of Uematsu proves deafening,\" and \"the soundtrack that accompanies this nonsensical adventure manages to encapsulate the shallow nature of the game perfectly.\" Moreover, some reviewers felt that the outfits worn by the main characters are too revealing and aimed at making the game more appealing to \"Final Fantasy\"s largely male audience.\n\nDespite the negative comments it has received, \"Final Fantasy X-2\"s critical reception has been largely positive, with IGN summarizing it as \"a brilliant and addictive romp through Spira that we're certainly glad to experience\", and GameSpot commenting that it is \"every bit as poignant, endearing, and engrossing as its forebears,\" with strengths that \"ultimately make ... \"X-2\"s minor flaws forgivable\". The game maintains an 85/100 approval rating on Metacritic.\n"}

In 1934, he moved to New York and began writing soap operas for radio station WMCA. Miller joined the Communist Party of the CPUSA in 1936. That same year, Gregory Rabinowitz recruited him to do \"opposition work,\" against rival political organizations. Miller's first year in the business was listening to a wiretap on Trotskyist leader, James Cannon's home. Later, he was to infiltrate the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and become an activist, while sending reports to the CPUSA and Soviet intelligence. The Trotskyists assigned him to the Sailors Union of the Pacific in 1941, and he became editor of the union's journal, in addition to writing on military affairs for the \"Fourth International\", a Trotskyist journal, during World War II. Miller's position gave the Communists a spy in the upper ranks of a rival union. Miller stated later, \"My job as a Stalinist was to keep track of the sailing of all Trotskyite seamen so a Stalinist agent would be at the port and have surveillance on whatever Trotskyites entered the Soviet Union.\"\n\nMiller's primary KGB contacts, as noted in Venona traffic, were Joseph Katz and a woman he knew as Sylvia Getzoff, also known as Rebecca Getzoff.\n\nIn the first half of 1944, Miller met in New York with Jack Soble who provided the KGB with microfilm of the page proofs of Leon Trotsky's biography of Joseph Stalin. Miller carried the microfilm to Mexico for the SWP to present to Natalia Sedova, Trotsky's widow. While in Mexico, Miller spent six weeks living in the Trotsky household. When he returned to New York, Miller delivered a written report to the KGB.\n\nMiller confessed his covert activities to the FBI in 1954 and appeared as a witness in Robert Soblen's espionage trial in 1961. He testified that his 1944 Mexican assignment included investigating reports of a budding alliance between Trotskyists, anarchists, and other radical groups in contact with French writer Victor Serge, who was living in exile. Miller testified that he was introduced to Lucy Booker, a courier between Miller and Soble in 1945. Reports on the Trotskyists were typed in Booker's residence. Soble informed Miller in 1945 that he was being transferred to another controller, and it was then that he was introduced to Soblen. Miller's story is confirmed by numerous decrypted Venona documents. Miller stated that he ceased activities for the KGB in 1945, and began writing children's books.\n\nFloyd Cleveland Miller is referenced in the following Venona project decryptions:\n\n727 KGB New York to Moscow, 20 May 1944; 751–752 KGB New York to Moscow, 26 May 1944; 826 KGB New York to Moscow, 7 June 1944; 846 KGB New York to Moscow, 14 June 1944; 851 KGB New York to Moscow, 15 June 1944; 1143–1144 KGB New York to Moscow, 10 August 1944.\n\n"}

With little formal education, Casey went to sea and came into contact with trade unionism. He probably immigrated to Queensland, Australia, in October 1883 and worked as a seaman, bushworker, coalminer and wharflabourer.\n\nOn 14 October 1883 Casey married his first wife, Alice Tighe (née Shile), who had already been married twice before. She left him in 1895 in New Australia and he then married Maria Antonia Sosa, a Paraguayan woman.\n\nWith Maria and their two sons, Casey raised cattle at \"La Novia\", \"dabbled in sidelines\" at Asunción, and wrote occasional letters and articles for the Australian Labor press. Casey was for many years the chief of police at \"New Australia\", until he died on 2 October 1946 in New Australia, Paraguay.\n\nIn February 1886, Casey was associated with the \"Queensland Maritime Council\" through the \"Brisbane Wharf Labourers' Union\" which he helped form the previous year. In 1888 the council sent him on an organizing mission to Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Mackay and Townsville; there he helped to found the \"Townsville Trades and Labor Council\" (T.L.C.).\n\nAs a member of the \"Brisbane T.L.C.\", Casey became a trustee for the \"Trades Hall\" reserve, worked for the June 1889 reconstitution of the council into the \"Australian Labour Federation\" (A.L.F), and became a member of its central district council.\n\nIn December 1889, along with Thomas Glassey and Albert Hinchcliffe, Casey successfully went to and brought the bush unions into the A.L.F. Casey was appointed full-time in April 1890 and in his first frenetic three months organized new unions and established district councils of the A.L.F. at Maryborough, Rockhampton, Charters Towers and Townsville. In February 1890 Casey was appointed the first chairman of the board of trustees of the \"Worker\".\n\nEmbroiled in the 1890 maritime strike, and 1891 shearers' strike, Casey preferred a general strike over Australia when more pragmatic union leaders wanted to negotiate a return to work, lest the defeats are turned into a rout. His extremism attracted attacks by anti-labor forces.\n\nIn the newspaper the \"Judge\", he was accused of incest and, in subsequent libel action, he was awarded contemptuous damages which did not cover costs. In Barcaldine, he was accused during the shearers' strike in 1891 of arson and jailed for two weeks before he was discharged without the charge being heard. \n\nCasey was a self-proclaimed evangelist for the 'new unionism', believing it would radically transform existing society, which he saw as dominated by \"those who rob legally, those who rob illegally and those who it pays to maintain the law\". After the failed shearers' strike in 1891, he found it hard to accept the A.L.F's support for the founding of the Australian Labor Party because he felt it would be easy prey for \"wirepullers\". He became a fervent member of William Lane's \"New Australia Co-operative Settlement Association\", which had set itself the goal to establish a utopia at \"New Australia\", South America. Casey donated his Brisbane home as a prize in a fund-raising raffle and left on 31 December 1893 with his wife with the second group of settlers on the ship \"Royal Tar Australia\" on the way to \"New Australia\" in Paraguay.\n\nHe remained in the Australian \"colony of New Australia\" even after it split, returning to Australia briefly in 1894 to try to obtain further support for the colony. He was elected president of the \"Sociedad Co-operativa Colonizadora Nueva Australia\" in 1896, though the colony's income improved rapidly \"after\" his defeat in 1900. He was the police chief of \"New Australia\" until he died on 2 October 1946.\n"}

It is classified as a moribund language, with an estimated 600-1000 speakers in Jiddat al-Harasis, a stony desert in south-central Oman. It is closely related to Mehri.\n\nHarsusi first came to the attention of outside scholars in 1937, when it was mentioned by Bertram Thomas in his book \"Four Strange Tongues of South Arabia.\" While certain scholars have claimed that Harsusi is a dialect of the more widely spoken Mehri language, most maintain that they are mutually intelligible but separate languages . Harsusi, like all the Modern South Arabian languages, is unwritten, though there have been recent efforts to create a written form using an Arabic-based script.\n\nBecause the Harasis people were for centuries the only human inhabitants of Jiddat al-Harasis, the language developed in relative isolation. However, as most Harasis children now attend Arabic-language schools and are literate in Arabic, Harsusi is spoken less in the home, meaning that it is not being passed down to future generations. Though the discovery of oil in the area and the conservation project for the re-introduced oryx herd have provided many job opportunities for Harsusi men, these factors have also caused many Harasis to speak Arabic and Mehri in addition to or in place of Harsusi. These pressures led one researcher to conclude in 1981 that \"within a few generations Harsusi will be replaced by Arabic, more specifically by the Omani Arabic standard dialect\" though this has not yet materialized.\n\nUNESCO has categorised Harsusi as a language that is \"definitely endangered\".\n\n"}

Alex Müller\n\nKarl Alexander Müller (born April 20, 1927) is a Swiss physicist and Nobel laureate. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1987 with Georg Bednorz for their work in superconductivity in ceramic materials.\n\nMüller was born in Basel, Switzerland, on 20 April 1927, to Irma (née Feigenbaum) and Paul Müller. His family immediately moved to Salzburg, Austria, where his father was studying music. Alex and his mother then moved to Dornach, near Basel, to the home of his grandparents. Then they moved to Lugano, in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, where he learned to speak Italian fluently. His mother died when he was 11.\n\nIn the spring of 1956 Müller married Ingeborg Marie Louise Winkler. They had a son, Eric, in the summer of 1957, and a daughter, Sylvia, in 1960. \n\nAfter his mother’s death, Müller was sent to school at the Evangelical College in Schiers, in the eastern part of Switzerland. Here he studied from 1938 to 1945, obtaining his baccalaureate (Matura).\n\nMüller then enrolled in the Physics and Mathematics Department of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich. He took courses by Wolfgang Pauli, who made a deep impression on him. After receiving his Diplom, he worked for one year, then returned to ETH for a PhD, submitting his thesis at the end of 1957.\n\nMüller joined the Battelle Memorial Institute in Geneva, soon becoming the manager of a magnetic resonance group. During this time he became a lecturer at the University of Zürich. In 1963 he accepted an offer as a \"research staff member\" at the IBM Zürich Research Laboratory in Rüschlikon, where he remained until his retirement. In parallel, he maintained his affiliation with University of Zurich where he was appointed professor in 1970. From 1972 to 1985 Müller was manager of the ZRL physics department. In 1982 he became an IBM Fellow. He received an honorary doctorate from Technical University of Munich and University of Geneva. In 1987 (before winning the Nobel Prize) he got an honorary degree (\"laurea honoris causa\") in Physics from the University of Pavia.\n\nFor his undergraduate diploma work, Müller studied under G. Busch. He worked on the Hall Effect in gray tin, a semimetal.\n\nBetween his undergraduate degree and beginning his graduate studies, he worked for one year in the Department of Industrial Research at ETH on the Eidophor large-scale display system.\n\nAt IBM his research for almost 15 years centered on SrTiO (strontium titanate) and related perovskite compounds. He studied their photochromic properties when doped with various transition-metal ions; their chemical binding, ferroelectric and soft-mode properties; and the critical and multicritical phenomena of their structural phase transitions. Important highlights of this research have been published in a book written together with Tom Kool from the University of Amsterdam (publisher: World Scientific).\n\nIn the early 1980s, Müller began searching for substances that would become superconductive at higher temperatures. The highest critical temperature (\"T\") attainable at that time was about 23 K. In 1983 Müller recruited Georg Bednorz to IBM, to help systematically test various oxides. A few recent studies had indicated these materials might superconduct. In 1986 the two succeeded in achieving superconductivity in lanthanum barium copper oxide (LBCO) at a temperature of 35 K. Over the previous 75 years the critical temperature had risen from 11 K in 1911 to 23 K in 1973 where it had remained for 13 years. Thus 35 K was incredibly high by the prevailing standards of superconductivity research. This discovery stimulated a great deal of additional research in high-temperature superconductivity, leading to the discovery of compounds such as BSCCO (\"T\" = 107 K) and YBCO (\"T\"' = 92 K).\n\nThey reported their discovery in the June 1986 issue of \"Zeitschrift für Physik B\". Before the end of the year, Shoji Tanaka at the University of Tokyo and then Paul Chu at the University of Houston had each independently confirmed their result. A couple of months later Chu achieved superconductivity at 93 K in YBCO, triggering a stampede of scientific interest exemplified by the 1987 \"Woodstock of physics\", at which Müller was a featured presenter.\n\nIn 1987 Müller and Bednorz were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physics—the shortest time between the discovery and the prize award for any scientific Nobel.\n\n\n\n"}

The story about a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's then bisexual lover Vita Sackville-West. Woolf's used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content, and was successful for it. Following Sackille-West's death, her son Nigel Nicolson would publish \"Portrait of a Marriage\", one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to Harold Nicolson.\nOther early examples include works of D.H. Lawrence, such as \"Women in Love\" (1920), and Colette's \"Claudine\" (1900–1903) series.\n\nIn more recent years, following a more culturally liberal perspective of sexuality, bisexuality has become more common in literature. This includes the work of Bret Easton Ellis, Anne Rice, and Alice Walker.\n\nIn 1981, \"X-Men\" writer Chris Claremont intended the character Destiny to be the lover of Brotherhood of Mutants teammate Mystique, a shape shifter, and had originally intended for Destiny and Mystique to be Nightcrawler's biological parents, with Mystique taking the form of a man for the conception; however, Marvel editors did not allow gay or bisexual characters at that time.\n\nIn 2007, the series \"\" introduced a son for popular superhero Wolverine in the form of Daken, his psychopathic bisexual son. In 2010, it was commented on by a writer for the character that for him all sexual conquest is about \"control\"; Daken regularly seduces male and females to suit his own ends.\n\nIn 2009, Peter David outed \"X-Men\" and \"X-Factor\" characters Rictor and Shatterstar as both bisexual, in a portrayal of their on-panel kiss. Under Jeff Loeb's run of \"X-Force\" in the 1990s, the two characters had been hinted at as being more than friends. In \"X-Factor\" in 2010, David writes of the two bisexual men in a monogamous same sex relationship as two characters with very different needs; Rictor wanting a monogamous loving relationship, and Shatterstar wanting to explore his new world of sexual potential for the first time.\n\nThe British film \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" (1971) portrayed a bisexual male named Bob with a lover of each gender. This was one of the earliest portrayals to be explicit on the subject of bisexuality, though a film versions of several novels involving bisexuality, such as \"Women in Love\" (1969) and \"Goldfinger\" (1964), had been released earlier. The film is told from the perspectives of the homosexual partner and the heterosexual partner. Critics of the time described Bob as \"shallow\", \"callous\", and \"selfish\". The following year, the American musical \"Cabaret\" was released as a film, featuring a bisexual protagonist.\n\n1975 saw the release of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", a musical about a bisexual anti-hero. Memorable films from the 1980s involving bisexuality include the film adaptation of \"The Color Purple\" (1985) and \"The Hunger\" (1983).\n\n1992's \"Basic Instinct\" received controversy from the bisexual community for portraying a bisexual as a psychopathic killer.\n\nIt's not uncommon for film adaptations of bisexual-themed novels or plays to remove the bisexual content. This is seen in films such as \"Less Than Zero\" (1987), \"Hair\" (1979), \"Midnight Express\" (1978) (affair between prisoners becomes fictionalized rape) and \"The Dreamers\" (2003).\n\nIn 1994, independent film \"Go Fish\", features a lesbian-identified character who has sex with a man, and is challenged by a \"jury\" who question her sexual self-identity. In 1997, Kevin Smith's \"Chasing Amy\" took on the question of sexual identity in a story about a lesbian-identified woman who falls in love with a man.\n\nBisexuality in film became increasingly common in the early 21st century, seen in studio-produced and high-profile independent films such as \"Wild Things\" (1998), \"Y tu mamá también\" (2001), \"Kinsey\" (2004), \"Alexander\" (2004), \"Brokeback Mountain\" (2005, receiving numerous awards), \"Rent\" (2005), Cloud Atlas (2012), and \"Call Me by Your Name\" (2017, receiving numerous awards). In 2007, the musical \"Love Songs\" was released in France to considerable success and a Golden Palm nomination.\n\nThe 2008 documentary \"Bi the Way\", which aired on the LGBT cable TV network Logo in August 2009 followed the lives of five bisexual Americans ages 11 to 28. The movie talked about bisexuality in general and featured scientific studies, interviews with bisexual leaders and media portrayals.\n\nBisexual characters appear in television series such as Karen Walker (portrayed by Megan Mullally) in the US situation comedy \"Will & Grace\" (1998-2006, 2017-present), and \"All My Children\" (1970). In a 1988 episode of NBC drama TV series \"Midnight Caller\", \"After It Happened\", a bisexual man is depicted as an AIDS carrier who deliberately infects straight women. This episode proved highly controversial in the bisexual community.\n\nIn 1990, a BBC mini-series adaptation of \"Portrait of a Marriage\" aired. In 2001, another bisexual-themed miniseries aired called \"Bob and Rose\", written by \"Queer as Folk\" creator Russell T Davies. The mini-series is about a gay man who falls in love with a straight woman, and is based on the experience of a friend of Davies.\n\nThe main character in \"Strangers With Candy\", Jerry Blank is bisexual.\n\nThe characters Brittany Pierce and Santana Lopez (portrayed respectively by Heather Morris and Naya Rivera) from the musical TV series \"Glee\" (2009–2015) are depicted as cheerleaders, who have dated other characters from both genders and even each other. Later on the show, Santana is revealed as a lesbian who was struggling and denying her sexuality, while Brittany is bisexual.\n\n\"Torchwood\" (2006), created by Russell T Davies, is a spin-off of long-running British science fiction television programme \"Doctor Who\". The show is based in Cardiff, Wales, and deals with several LGBT themes, specifically bisexuality. Each of the main characters in \"Torchwood\" has same-sex encounters at some point in the first season, with \"The Sun\" describing all of the characters on Torchwood as bisexual. Davies has said that he hopes to defy audience expectations of monosexual characters:\n\nThe lead male in the series, Captain Jack Harkness originated in parent series \"Doctor Who\", which is considered a family show, as opposed to \"Torchwood\"'s adult orientation. Davies has also described Jack as omnisexual. Other bisexual characters in \"Torchwood\" are Jack's lovers Ianto and Captain John, and Jack's colleague Toshiko.\n\nThe high rated MTV series, \"A Shot At Love With Tila Tequila\" (2007), is a bisexual reality show. Tila Tequila, is the bisexual bachelorette, trying to find love from 16 straight males and 16 lesbians, as well as its spin off \"A Double Shot at Love with the Ikki Twins\".\n\nThe Showcase series \"Lost Girl\" features a bisexual succubus as the main character and there are several bisexual characters and themes throughout the show including a bisexual love triangle.\nIn a 2008 \"New York Times\" interview, actor Sean Hayes revealed he is working on a television project called \"Bi-Coastal\" about \"a guy with a wife and kids in California and a boyfriend in New York.\"\n\nThe ABC drama \"Grey's Anatomy\" features Callie Torres, a bisexual main character portrayed by Sara Ramirez. The show portrays Callie's first experience with a woman and her realization that she is bisexual. She eventually goes on to marry fellow surgeon Arizona Robbins.\n\nThe FOX television series \"House\" features a bisexual female doctor, Remy \"Thirteen\" Hadley, played by Olivia Wilde, from season four onwards. The same network had earlier aired the television series \"The O.C.\", which for a time featured bisexual Alex Kelly (also played by Olivia Wilde), the local rebellious hangout spot's manager, as a love interest of Marissa Cooper.\n\nThe Nickelodeon animated series \"The Legend of Korra\" features main protagonist Korra, a teenage girl, as well as major character Asami Sato, a young female industrialist. The two girls are both initially romantically interested in the same man, but after putting their feelings aside, they manage to become friends. Over the course of the series, their relationship is shown growing and developing, and eventually culminates in the final scene, which indicated the start of a romantic relationship between Korra and Asami. The series was lauded for its unprecedented representation of bisexuality in American children's television, as well as its portrayal of a same-sex relationship between bisexual women.\n\nOn December 30, 2009, MTV premiered their 23rd season of the show \"The Real World\". The series took place in Washington DC, and featured two bisexual characters, Emily Schromm, and Mike Manning. Manning's sexuality appears to have generated some controversy, with both bloggers and many comments on blogs saying that he is really gay,\nalthough he himself identifies as bisexual, and has dated both genders. A behind the scenes MTV Aftershow and subsequent interview also revealed that both Manning and Schromm had encounters with both men and women while on the show, but when the show was edited, both were made to appear as if they had been with only men on the show.\n\nIn 2011, presenter and singer-songwriter Tom Robinson on BBC Radio 4 explored the topic of bisexuality.\n\nDavid Bowie's androgynous appearance and open bisexuality was reflected in some of his songs, in particular \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" (1972). The original video directed by Mick Rock, featuring androgynous dancers from Lindsay Kemp's mime troupe, was banned by \"Top of the Pops\". The single was not released in America, being judged too risqué by RCA.\n\nIn 1995, Jill Sobule's song \"I Kissed a Girl\" was met with considerable success. The song told the story of flirtation between two suburban female friends, both with male partners.\n\nIn 2003, Britney Spears staged a kiss with Madonna (who also kissed Christina Aguilera in the same performance) on an MTV Video Music Awards performance that would continue to fuel bisexual chic, and at the time many news and tabloid outsources referred to it as \"lesbian chic\", since it was clear from her impending marriage to Kevin Federline that Spears was certainly not a monosexual lesbian. The kiss is seen as a publicity stunt but helped to fuel the ever-growing trend. In November 2006, Paris Hilton appeared in public with her hand on Spears' left breast.\n\nIn 2008, Katy Perry released a song called \"I Kissed a Girl\", though it is unrelated to the Jill Sobule version. It was by received \"Billboard\" Top 40 success. The song is about a girl's curiosity about kissing another girl, though she has a boyfriend.\n\nIn 2008, Lady Gaga, who is openly bisexual, released her second single \"Poker Face\", which is about fantasizing about women while in bed with a man. It received both critical and commercial success as well as vast praise from the bisexual community.\n\nAs of October 2009, there is a bisexual \"webisode\" series known as \"A Rose By Any Other Name\" being released on YouTube that was directed by Independent film director and bisexual rights advocate Kyle Schickner of Fencesitter Films. The plot of the series revolves around a lesbian identified woman who falls in love with a straight man, and goes on to realize she is actually bisexual, and the reaction of both her friends and her boyfriend's friends.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18431120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18431120", "title": "Military sociology", "text": "Military sociology\n\nMilitary sociology is a subfield within sociology. It corresponds closely to C. W. Mills's summons to connect the individual world to broader social structures. Military sociology aims toward the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as a Military organization. This highly specialized sub-discipline examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civil-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies.\n\nMilitary Sociology reflects the diversity of methods employed by sociology itself. These include large-scale data analysis, participant observation, social network analysis, survey research, social network analysis, comparative history, case studies etc.\n\nContemporary military sociology is primarily a result of the World War II and Cold War eras. These events initiated the systematic study of military sociology, though it stands to reason that the relationship between the military and society would predate these events. There are numerous topics within military sociology, and it is important to note that its scope is not exclusively limited to the military institution itself or to its members. Rather, military sociology encompasses areas such as civilian-military relations and the relationship between the military and other military groups or governmental agencies. Other topics within military sociology include:\n\nThere has been discussion about whether the military should be seen as more of an occupation rather than an institution. Although the military still retains institutional principles (patriotic values, historic traditions, etc.) the military is becoming oriented to the principles of business and economics and can be fairly categorized as a profession. This can be explored in relating to other professions in the grouping of power and compensation. There are different ranks within the military, granting some people more power. Many young people look to the military for compensation benefits and the opportunity to attend college without enormous loans. \n\nTwo leading scholars, Samuel Huntington and Morris Janowitz, influence the notion of military professionalism in military sociology. Huntington argued that there should be a high degree of autonomy within the military profession over military matters., because civilians did not possess the necessary corporate ness or expertise to oversee military matters. He called this objective control. Janowitz, on the other hand, asserted that the role of the military in modern society was so complex, and with such high stakes that the duty of the professional soldier went well beyond the execution of violence. The elite of the military had an obligation to maintain stable international relations, and this required management expertise and political skills in addition to the classical military officer skillset. Janowitz was concerned that the military profession could become a self-perpetuating, self-serving clique. Therefore, it was important that the military be socially representative of the citizen it served. According to Sam C. Sarkesian and Robert E. Connor, the military profession holds the view that it is a unique profession. There are six key elements that are paramount in shaping the character of the military profession. These are listed as:\n\nPerhaps no other institution places as much emphasis on procedures for assimilating new members as does the armed forces. Assimilation involves the continuous process of recruitment, selection, training, and career development. Not only must the new recruit, officer, or enlisted officer learn new and difficult skills. He or she is also expected to master an elaborate code of professional behavior and etiquette, since membership in the military means participation in an organizational community which regulates behavior both on and off the \"job\". The American Military utilizes the citizen-soldier concept to gather military personnel from across the country. This term means the ability to quickly round up or call up troops for war or military tour at a virtual moment's notice. But once the assignment or tour is over, the military personnel are returned to civilian life.\n\nAccording to Norman A. Hilman 2.5 million men were enlisted into military during the peacetime draft. During that rapid transitional period, many soldiers may have felt lost or confused by the differences in their previous life (civilian) and their new military life, which calls for a demand to conform to new orders that are expected to be followed without question. Although, there were many men and now women who have voluntarily joined in the armed forces, there are those who view joining the military and working for the government as selling out. The negative characterization of military life can be a real turn off for most people looking from the outside. Despite the negative thoughts about military life and the incentives of economic security, military recruitment practices changed from a means to help one's country into a way to attain an education back to a need to serve one's country, in recent years. Throughout its changes the enlisting numbers have not declined, they have stayed steady, if not increasing over the years.\n\nA military family by definition is a unit that may consist of husband and wife and children (in many English-speaking countries, called military brats, which is a term of respect and endearment, not an insult); with either the husband and/or wife as the primary military enlisted. The emotional stress that a partner can experience, before, during and after a soldier, sailor, marine or airman's deployment is perhaps just as bad mentally, as the one who is fighting in the military. Those whose husbands or wives were deployed for the first time, rated their feelings about the whole experience as being very sad, and found it difficult to cope with the sudden absence of their loved one. However, women or men whose spouses have been deployed prior, coped with the present deployment with more positive reactions. They felt that they had a job to do away from home that was important and they and the rest of their family (children) had to be supportive and take care of things while the family member was away. Children begin taking on more adult responsibilities like: cooking, cleaning, getting groceries, etc. Despite the positive coping skills of some military families, some do not do well on their own coping with the long separation from their family and family members. Stressors and stress reactions of spouses vary over time. What is perceived as stressful before the deployment differs from what is perceived as stressful during and after the deployment. Most deployments last 6–18 months, and during this time, the role that the members of the family believe they should hold changes. This often makes it difficult for all members of the family.\n\nApproximately one-fifth of all enlisted 18-year-olds and one-third of all junior personnel in the United States Army are married, compared to less than 5% of civilian 18-year-olds. As a result, young military families experience many of the same hardships that can accompany the start of a family in greater numbers than young civilian families. Like young civilian families, young military families may also experience maturity issues, life inexperience, low incomes, and living away from home. But these issues are compounded by the fact that young military families also experience special hardships not experienced by young civilian families. For example, while many young families, both military and civilian, often endure difficulties, civilian families are more likely to have the support of family and friends which is less likely to be an option for military families (e.g. on a military base stationed in a foreign country).\n\nAnother hardship experienced more commonly by military families (compared with civilian families) is frequent relocation. Approximately 33% of military families relocate every year compared to only 5% of civilian families. Special planning must be undertaken by families in which both parents are on active duty, as either could be (re)deployed at any time. (Planning for this contingency can be especially difficult.) In other military families with only one active-duty-parent, the other parent is less likely to stay at home with children as in the past. Rather, they are more likely to find employment and/or attend college, and therefore find constant relocations more stressful due to the commitments to working and studying, respectively.\n\nMilitary families have the option of living at the parents’ place of employment. For families living in an on-base house, they must follow the rules of the base command and the housing office on how to maintain their property and are afforded little privacy. In short, they may experience pressure to conform to the base’s standards of behavior. Some families may opt not to live on base, but off-base housing is usually more expensive and can be inconvenient.\n\nDe Soir suggests there are seven stages in the way partners of married personnel experience stress before, during and after deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, almost half of the enlisted force is below 25 for both men and women with the average age being 27. The trend of youth is perpetuated by the fact that most people enter into the service at 18 years of age and leave after only a few years. This creates a situation in which those with college experience are underrepresented in military as they only make up 8.5% of the military force. Youth inclusion in armed conflict is not a new concept or one restricted to large well organized forces such as the United States military. In various societies over time, youth has been prized in armed conflict. Such instances include the Dinka of the Sudan, boys who received spears as an initiation rite between sixteen and eighteen years of age, the nineteenth-century Cheyenne who joined their first war parties when they were about fourteen, and the female warriors of Dahomey who were recruited between nine and fifteen. During the American Civil War, it has been estimated that between 250,000 and 420,000 soldiers under 18 years of age served in Union and Confederate armies, which yields somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of recruits. During these earlier periods youth was not looked upon in the context of innocence as it is framed today, rather children were seen as naturally existing with adults, as they frequently coexisted with them through apprenticeships and other work. It was not until formal education became more widespread that a change in attitudes towards youth develop, and consequently a prolongation of the perceived youth period.\n\nIn the past, all U.S. service academies required attendance to religious services which in 1972 was found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Anderson v. Laird. Despite this, the Naval Academy still has prayer before meals and attendance is required at these meals. This has caused some students at the Naval Academy to seek legal help from the American Civil Liberties Union. A comparable practice of pre-meal prayers for compulsory meals at the Virginia Military Institute was found unconstitutional by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Mellen v. Bunting in 2003.\n\nThe religious spectrum of the United States military is comparable to that of the general population. In comparison with the nearest available age group, a demographic of 20- to 39-year-olds that make up eighty percent of the military, there are slight variations. Mainline Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists are underrepresented, but other Christian religions (such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, Church of God, Seventh Day Adventists, Assemblies of God, and others) disproportionately overrepresented, at nearly three times the percentage in the applicable demographic. Those reporting atheism or no religion are very slightly overrepresented. None of these differences account for more than a 10% spread, Christians self-identifying as Protestant only constituting the largest discrepancy. The data and other studies suggest that servicemembers may be less likely to identify with mainstream religious organizations than the country's general population.\n\nThroughout history non-indigenous members of minority groups have been absorbed into military service. Examples of this practice in ancient armies include Hannibal's use of Ethiopian soldiers, the Roman Auxilia, the Byzantine Empire's recruitment of the Middle Eastern population, and the Ottoman Empire's use of religious minorities through the Millet system. In these cases where military service was voluntary, minorities saw it as an opportunity to progress socially in the society, and perhaps achieve citizenship for themselves and by extension, to their children. For most of the history of minority groups in military organizations, minorities were often segregated from the dominant racial group by forming separate contingents for such groups. This was true in ancient military organizations, but also in a more recent historical context through the French-Canadian regiments of Canada during World War I, and World War II, the British army and their conscription of various minority groups from their conquests during colonialism, and the segregation of minority groups into Caucasian commanded, minority composed, regiments during similar time periods as mentioned previously. In the case of the United States, African-American participation in the military after World War II was high due to the better treatment afforded African-Americans in the military by Caucasian members. With the end of job exclusion by 1954 reenlistment rates increased on average until they were close to double that of Caucasian servicemen. A similar situation arose in the United Kingdom with minority participation, but both situations saw a sharp disparity in upper rank distribution, as both had, and to a lesser extent, still have a disproportionately low level of upper ranked minorities.\n\nMilitary and gender issues is a diverse and plural field within military sociology. The roles of women can include being the transmitter of cultural values to children, reproducers of boundaries and active militants in national struggles. Women have served in the military throughout history. Women's military recruitment rejects the idea that 'women should be protected'. Recruitment is very important in Latin America, Israel, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. In Turkey, the wife of the chief commander represents the mother of the military family. Some states in the developing world are egalitarian and many women are recruited into the military to achieve the modern ideal. With women's customary role as a nurturer and mother, the increased equality and inclusion of women in the military could change the reason for war or raison d'être of wars.\n\nSexual assault in the United States military is an issue for military women. The 2012 Pentagon survey found approximately 26,000 women and men were sexually assaulted. Of those, only 3,374 cases were reported. In 2013, a new Pentagon report found that 5,061 troops reported cases of assault. Many people are optimistic that this 50% increase in reports is indicative of victims \"growing more comfortable in the system.\" Of these reported, however, only 484 cases went to trial, and only 376 resulted in convictions.\n\nDuring World War II women served in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corp (WAAC) which was later renamed Women's Army Corps (WAC). In addition, there was WAVES, or Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services.\n\nJane Addams and Cynthia Enloe have been identified as women who have contributed key ideas to military sociology . Addams's influence stems from her feminist perspectives on peace and its influence on peacekeeping . Enloe's influence is traced to her feminist view of the military.\n\nHomosexuals were not recruited into the U.S. military from World War II to the Clinton presidency. In 1993, the Clinton administration began the policy of \"Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue\", meaning that military personnel will be neither compelled (\"Don't ask\") nor allowed (\"Don't tell\") nor harassed (\"Don't pursue\") to disclose or discuss their sexual identity while serving in the military. The \"Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue\" policy actually had the effect of increasing discharges due to homosexuality from 617 in 1994 to 1,273 in\n2001. Estimates have been made that in 2000 there were 1 million gay and lesbian veterans in the U.S. population as based on census information. Homosexual women with partners reported higher rates of military service than other women, while homosexual male veterans served for a similar amount of time as heterosexual male veterans.\n\nRecently there has been interest in how the modern militaries have constructed their knowledge. Military science in modern armed forces has taken on the aura of a hard science when it is arguably a combination of hard science, sociology (\"soft science\"), and military history (the humanities). Postmodern deconstructions of the assumptions behind modern military science can be effective in revealing how modern militaries have socially constructed their reality.\n\nIn the modern relationship between the military and the state, the state relies on the military to protect it from external threats as well as violence between various internal groups. Concurrently, the military draws so-called 'violent resources' from the state and from society. Such resources can include money, technology, raw materials, and manpower. The relationship has changed somewhat from the 16th and 17th centuries, however, where internal centers of power and specific sectors of society (e.g., skilled builders or guilds) were somewhat more autonomous than the rest. These sectors were not under the direct control of the sovereign power and could avoid feeding resources to the state. This meant that pre-modern militaries were 1) somewhat weaker than the modern version due to a lack of state-funded resources but also 2) powerful sectors of society that controlled certain privately funded resources and which could raise their own mercenary forces if needed.\nAs this system began to evolve, states started to exert more control over society by exploiting 'existential fears' which led to the creation of various bureaucratic methods including mass conscription, tax systems, and territorial centralization. The result is that various civil sectors began to work exclusively for the state, which in turn desired a stronger military, and which used these sectors to extract more resources and more manpower for exclusive military use. This 'modern' military now was reliant on the state for its very existence, whereas, in pre-modern times, the military could be the tool of various autonomous sectors of society.\n\nBurkard Schmitt a Research Fellow for the EU Institute for Security Studies identifies two types of research. Pure research is done from the bottom-up with no specific demand and are long term oriented. Capability research is done from the top down, most research of this type is defined for mostly military use with a specific goal in mind.\nFew European countries have had significant investments in research and technology. National sensitivities and defense companies that are hesitant to share research findings has long hindered research in Europe. This is beginning to change with the formation and strengthening of the EU and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The EU is currently implementing its \"Agenda for advanced research relating to global security\" which is crucial to the future of European security. The idea in Europe is that research should be undertaken by all member states. A goal for member states and something to aid future research is a \"harmonization\" of military requirements.\nThe American model for research is based on the old German standard, which the Americans emulated starting from the founding of the American Chemical Society in 1876. The use of research and industry to develop new and more deadly chemical and biological weapons is an intriguing aspect of the modern military. German universities were involved in early chemical gas development for use in World War I. German universities \"carefully cultivated the ideal of science as an emphatically value-free activity; they bestowed upon their wards the right and the duty to serve the interests of knowledge and to brush aside other interests with which the welfare of scientific pursuits might clash.\" American universities also had chemical labs, Harvard University began work on poison gas in 1917. By World War I, the chemical industry began to influence politics because of the great interdependence between industry, military and politics.\n\nThe amount of research that is done relates to the U.S. economy, which includes the largest military budget in the world. This has created a strong link between military, the state, and corporate America. This has been called the \"military industrial complex\", but the military has also dominated large university science departments. This concept is the military industrial academic complex, or MIA.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are found mainly in Bou Saâda, M'Sila and Djelfa, but there is also a significant number of them in Ghardaïa Province, beyond their ancestral region.\n\nThe oral lore of the Ouled Naïl people claims ancient Arab descent from tribes that arrived in the area about a thousand years ago. Some traditions trace their ancestry to the Banu Hilal of Hejaz, who came to the highlands through El Oued, Ghardaia, while others claim that they are direct descendants of Idris I..\n\nThe Ouled Naïl are seminomadic or nomadic people living in the highlands of the range of the Saharan Atlas to which they gave their name. The town of Djelfa has been traditionally an important market and trade centre for the Ouled Naïl, especially for their cattle. The town has cold and long winters with temperatures averaging 4 °C. In recent years Djelfa Province has become one of the most populated provinces of Algeria with a population of 1,164,870.\n\nThe Ouled Naïl have traditionally reared cattle as nomads in their mountain grasslands, as well in the northern Hodna region and the Dayas in the south. When they are nomadic they live in black-and-red striped tents, but they also used to live in \"dechra\", or non fortified villages, or in ksour, fortified ones. Cereal cultivation is possible in the mountain heights, although with rather irregular results. They rarely were able to cultivate date palms in the heights but obtained dates from other areas by trading, especially in Bou Saâda located at the feet of the northern end of the mountain range.\n\nDespite the harsh conditions of the dry and cold highlands where they live, this ethnic group has managed to fare fairly well in their traditional environment along the centuries. However, the odd years of drought and years with prolonged, cold winters are disastrous for the Ouled Nail; in 1944, and again in 1947, when weather conditions were especially rough, about 50% of their livestock died and famines followed.\n\nThe Ouled Naïl tribe originated a style of music, sometimes known as Bou Saâda music after the town near their homeland. In belly dancing, the term refers to a style of dance originated by the Ouled Naïl, noted for their way of dancing. \n\nAlthough their primary roles and activities in their rural milieu were connected with animal farming, most women trained in the art of dance and song from childhood. Thus for Ouled Naïl females the practice of leaving their ancestral home and settling in a nearby desert town as entertainers was common. This was especially so in times of disaster and famine, when a woman had relative freedom to fend for herself in order to survive, save money and improve her future economic status.\n\nThe 1956 edition of the Michelin Guide devotes only a few lines to the Ouled Naïl mountain region; Djelfa is not even mentioned and the Ouled Naïl people are \"mere courtesans and Oriental dancers\". \nFrench colonialist representations of the Ouled Naïl concentrated almost exclusively on women who temporarily left their home and settled in some nearby town. However, none of the highland tribes to which they belonged were specialised in prostitution and only some Ouled Naïl women became dancers. Still, the exuberance of their ornaments and the exoticism of their costumes added to the general fascination.\n\nAuguste Maure, an orientalist photographer that lived in Biskra was active from 1860 to 1907 and took many photographs of landscapes and cities of south Algeria (El Kantara, Sidi Okba, Chetma, Tilatou, Tolga, Touggourt). The female members of the Ouled Naïl tribe, wearing the traditional colorful costumes and covered by jewels, were often represented on Maure photographs which were appreciated by tourists.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "854690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=854690", "title": "Party class", "text": "Party class\n\nThe sociologist Max Weber formulated a three-component theory of stratification in which he defined party class as a group of people (part of a society) that can be differentiated on the basis of their affiliations with other engaged members in the political domain.\n\nUnlike communities, where problems arise and are solved by those within the group, parties are formed when individuals seek out support beyond their immediate spatial environment. Status groups such as communities, or groups of individuals in similar class situations, become parties only when their means of mobilizing and assembling in pursuit of power becomes structured. A teachers' union is one example of a party drawn from a collective communal body. While the party does not necessarily represent the will of each individual member, it forms on the basis of rational collective interests and the assignment of outside individuals to protect those interests. For instance, when taxpayers in a geographic region mobilize to vote against support for allocation of resources to local schools, the teachers' union may enter the political realm to protect the interests of its members. These pursuits are thought to be rational in that they only represent the demands of the members insofar as they relate to the reason for that party's congregation. While all members of the same union may support protection of local wildlife, those interests would be pursued via a separate party.\n\nUnlike power formed on the basis of wealth or status, parties tend to most successfully aggregate and mobilize when their members represent a range of environments and social statuses. While a party's objective may ultimately be the protection of financial capital or the status of its members, parties initially form to represent a range of group interests. A party's political program represents both the key issues that party members decide on once congregated, and pull issues aimed at attracting members who share detached but similar interests. For instance, the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity may use political leverage to obtain funding from the local government, but the homebuilding it provides in low-income neighborhoods draws grassroots support for the organization's efforts. While parties always seek to maintain political leverage, the local environment provides the human capital with which to mobilize those demands.\n\nAccording to Weber, parties can form in unintended directions and pursue ends that are not initially part of their intended purpose. In \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\", Weber argued that the Protestant religion, initially formed as a spiritual institution, became the ethic that underlay the transition into capitalism. The initial pro-capitalist political parties that formed in Europe reflected the desire to prove success in spiritual life via the accumulation of capital, which became the pinnacle of “worldly calling”. As he argued of rationality in general, parties become the formally sanctioned, bureaucratic extension of emotional authority as society transitions into modernity. Parties form primarily in democratic societies because of the ideological differences that can arise between individuals in the same geographic region.\n\nAs more contemporary theorists have noted, parties tend to become overburdened with demands as they grow larger and lose focus on initial key issues. One example, pursued by Doug McAdams in his writing Political Process and the Development of Black Insurgency, was the Civil Rights Movement. Although the movement initially succeeded and made enormous social and political impact due to its rational and centered goals, the movement began to weaken throughout the 1970s due in part to irreconcilable views touted by its various leaders and sects.\n\n"}

{"id": "1326228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1326228", "title": "Price system", "text": "Price system\n\nIn economics, a price system is a component of any economic system that uses prices expressed in any form of money for the valuation and distribution of goods and services and the factors of production. Except for possible remote and primitive communities, all modern societies use price systems to allocate resources, although price systems are not used exclusively for all resource allocation decisions.\n\nA price system may be either a fixed price system where prices are administered by a government body, or it may be a free price system where prices are left to float \"freely\" as determined by supply and demand uninhibited by regulations. A mixed price system involves a combination of both administered and unregulated prices.\n\nPrice systems have been around as long as there has been money. \n\nThe price system has evolved into the system of global capitalism that is present in the early 21st century. The Soviet Union and other Communist states with a centralized planned economy maintained controlled price systems. Whether the ruble or the dollar is used in the economic system, the criterion of a price system is the use of money as an arbiter and usual final arbiter of whether a thing is done or not. In other words, few things are done without consideration for the monetary costs and the potential making of a profit in a price system.\n\nThe American economist Thorstein Veblen wrote a seminal tract on the development of the term as discussed in this article: \"The Engineers and the Price System\". Its chapter VI, \"A Memorandum on a Practicable Soviet of Technicians\" discusses the possibility of socialist revolution in the United States comparable to that then occurring in Russia (the Soviets had not yet at that time become a state (USSR formed in 1922)).\n\nThe original conception of socialism involved the substitution of money as a unit of calculation and monetary prices as a whole with calculation in kind (or valuation based on natural units), with business and financial decisions replaced by engineering and technical criteria for managing the economy. Fundamentally, this meant that socialism would operate under different economic dynamics than those of capitalism and the price system. \n\nIn the 1930s, the economists Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner developed a comprehensive model of a socialist economy that utilized a price system and money for the allocation of capital goods. In contrast to a free-market price system, \"socialist\" prices would be set by a planning board to equal the marginal cost of production to achieve neoclassical Pareto efficiency. Because this model of socialism relied upon money and administered prices as opposed to non-monetary calculation in physical magnitudes, it was labelled \"market socialism\". In effect, Oskar Lange conceded that calculations in a socialist system would have to be performed in value terms with a functioning price system rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria as in the classic concept of socialism.\n\nAustrian School economist Friedrich Hayek argued that a free price system allowed economic coordination via the price signals that changing prices send, which is regarded as one of his most significant and influential contributions to economics.\n\nIn \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\" (1945), Hayek wrote, \"The price system is just one of those formations which man has learned to use (though he is still very far from having learned to make the best use of it) after he had stumbled upon it without understanding it. Through it not only a division of labor but also a coördinated utilization of resources based on an equally divided knowledge has become possible. The people who like to deride any suggestion that this may be so usually distort the argument by insinuating that it asserts that by some miracle just that sort of system has spontaneously grown up which is best suited to modern civilization. It is the other way round: man has been able to develop that division of labor on which our civilization is based because he happened to stumble upon a method which made it possible. Had he not done so, he might still have developed some other, altogether different, type of civilization, something like the \"state\" of the termite ants, or some other altogether unimaginable type.\"\n"}
{"id": "25781539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25781539", "title": "Puukkojunkkari", "text": "Puukkojunkkari\n\nPuukkojunkkari (or \"häjy\", Swedish: \"knivjunkare\", translated to English as knife-fighter; literal translation: \"knife junker\") was a term used of troublemakers who were active in the Southern Ostrobothnia region of Finland in the 19th century. Fights among puukkojunkkaris were common, and often resulted in homicide; one could even get stabbed at a funeral. Puukkojunkkaris usually made trouble at weddings, stole horses and circulated among towns and villages. They also participated in gambling, thievery and courtship with women. The most notorious puukkojunkkaris lived in towns near the Lapuanjoki river, such as Alahärmä. The first homicides happened in the 1790s, but the famous \"golden age\" of puukkojunkkaris lasted from the 1820s to the 1880s.\n\nPuukkojunkkaris were present in all society classes. They included both free houseowners and farm servants. The houseowners were often gang leaders. Puukkojunkkaris were often feared and respected, and fought for their honour. The code of honour disallowed fear and respected fighting. Puukkojunkkaris were often difficult to prosecute because few people dared testify against them. Puukkojunkkaris also received admiration and respect because they dared to stand up against society and authorities. \n\nMany attempts have been made to explain the rise of puukkojunkkaris. In the 19th century, the living standard in Ostrobothnia rose, and because of this, weddings became grandiose events with lots of alcoholic beverages. Young men in Ostrobothnia did not often get a chance to inherit their own farm in their home town and earn their own wealth, which led to frustration. \n\nReino Kallio’s theory of knife-fighters is based on the idea of a counter reaction caused by social control that has been taken too far. He sees youth’s violent behaviour as a protest-like rebellion against the pressure exercised by the power structure; particularly against local laws and parish discipline. The resistance that started as little more than slight mischief became branded as troublemakers and led to a path towards serious crimes. This was particularly due to the fact that parish discipline, which was stricter than general law, lowered the threshold of crime. At the time, there were many new ways of youngsters spending their free time, such as wandering around outdoors at night, which was considered a breach against the curfew and a threat to the existence of class society. Therefore, district courts started punishing people for curfew at night – as well as for other breakages against parish discipline. \n\nThe fundamentalist church and religious revivalist movements in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as pietism, also had a negative view towards young people’s leisure activities due to moral reasons. This led to competition between different religious groups, first leading to tighter church discipline and then to parish discipline. The situation was brought to a head by the labour shortage due to tar and peatland burning cultivation that brought more tension to the working conditions, while the rich, house-owning population competed with each other, building baronial, 1.5 to 2 storeys high residential buildings. By invoking general regulations, masters could avoid disciplinary conflicts with their children or hirelings when there was labour shortage. Furthermore, increased drinking caused both problems to families and conflicts inside communities.\n\nThe disciplinary regulations that were normally confirmed by the governor limited and regulated in detail the already scarce free time that youngsters had: in addition to curfew at night, the celebration of dances, the publication of the banns of marriage and weddings, gatecrashing, moving, gathering, the use of spirits, cardplaying as well as general noisemaking and loitering. Because the young age groups usually took care of the heaviest physical work, conditional fines were introduced in the 19th century to prevent days off. In Lapua, Laihia and Mustasaari, not only hirelings, but also house-owners and crofters were banned from having free days.\n\nAt worst, parish discipline even led to group criminalisation of young people, as was the case in Kauhava and Vähäkyrö in the 1770s and 1780s, in Vöyri in the 1820s and 1830s, and in the greater parishes of Laihia and Lapua a couple of decades later. Parish discipline was implemented as group punishments, and they were only taken to court in certain parishes in southern Ostrobothnia, not elsewhere in Finland – except for a few possible exceptions. All in all, troublemaking was based on the background of a long-term crisis caused by a radical socio-economic change, which triggered youth violence due to the parish discipline managed and maintained by authorities. Finally, the emerged culture of violence also started feeding itself.\n\nThe model that Mr. Kallio used for the first time in his thesis in 1982 has also been called the youth rebellion theory. Its main sources include court minutes and document material from local archives. The theory approaches the stigmatisation theory that the internationally known sociologist, Mr. Anthony Giddens, considers to be one of the most important criminal theories. According to this theory, criminal behaviour is not a characteristic of an individual or a group, but rather an interactive process between criminals and non-criminals. The theory is based on the concept that no deed is criminal in itself, but the definition of crime constitutes a part of the exercise of power. An individual stigmatised as criminal is discriminated by authorities, which supports criminal behaviour and displacement from the mainstream population. A similar view can indirectly also be seen in the drama Pohjalaisia (Ostrobothnians).\n\nIn the central parishes of both Finnish and Swedish-speaking southern Ostrobothnia, those who defended parish laws and regulations particularly directed their aims for power towards young working population, such as house-owners’, crofters’ and independent workers’ children, as well as soldiers and servants, who were in a socially subordinate position. Hundreds of them were fined for violations against parish discipline during the last three decades under the Swedish reign, so it was at the same time the first large-scale youth problem in the Finnish society that we know of.\n\nOn the local level, order was maintained by masters and, as trustees, mainly village aldermen and lay members of the courts, whose duty was to inform authorities of any violations against rules. Aldermen were sometimes even fined for neglecting their order maintaining duties. Many rural police chiefs also aimed at catching those guilty of violations against general order, and taking them to court. In the worst cases of public disorder, rural police chiefs had to call Russian armed forces, i.e. Cossacks, for help – one of them was even killed at a wedding in Lapua in 1862. Maintenance of order, and repetitive criminalisation after that, led to their displacement from the community. As a result, some of them considered themselves criminals, acted accordingly and even boasted of their criminal “heroic deeds”, which were sometimes also directed at rural police chiefs, priests and trustees. Santeri Alkio describes disturbances aimed at the last-mentioned group in his novel Puukkojunkkarit (Knife-fighters).\n\n\n\n\n"}

After this war Reddiyars settled at Samugarengapuram, Seelathikulam and all over Tirunelveli Region in the 14th century.\nA mural at the Tiruppudaimaruthur temple in Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu, shows the emissaries of the Vijayanagara king Achyutadeva Raya serving an ultimatum to the Travancore ruler Bhoothala Veera Udaya Marthanda Varma to pay tributes to him and return the Pandya territory to Sri Vallabhan. It also depicts the \"Tamiraparani battle\" between the armies of Achyutadeva Raya and Bhoothala Varma. They are believed moved into Tamil Nadu with the expansion of Vijayanagar empire along with other Telugu and Kannada origin social groups. They have their origin in Vannipuranam.\n\nThey migrated from Andhra Pradesh and Orissa to Tamil Nadu particularly to Madurai District at the period of Thirumalai Nayakkar rule.\n\nThrough emigration, there are now many Reddiars in the Tamil communities of United States, South Africa, Singapore, Australia, United Kingdom.. The title does not generally mark the person as a Telugu but as an ethnic Tamil along with Naidu or Naidoo, Pillai, Gounder and Chetty as surnames used in the Tamil diaspora. See distinction between Reddy and Reddiars.\n\nIn India, Reddiars are classified as Forward caste. In Tamil Nadu, Reddiars are classified as Forward Caste by the British. For example, the first chief minister of Tamil Nadu (Madras Presidency in 1920) was a Reddiar. Today, Reddiars are generally classified as Forward Caste in Tamil Nadu. For example, a Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha in 2006 distinguished between Reddiars who are generally classified as forward castes in Tamil Nadu and Koda Reddys who are classified as Scheduled Tribes in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, the Madras High Court in 2015 considered this distinction between Reddiars who are generally classified as forward castes and konda reddys who are classified as Scheduled Tribes as dispositive a writ petition in a reservation case in Tamil Nadu. After Independence, some sub-castes among Reddiars in Tamil Nadu such a Ganjam Reddys have been included in the Backward Class list by the state government. Some sub-castes like Ganjam Reddys from Tamil Nadu have now sought classification as backwards caste in the central government list. Konda Reddys are classified as Scheduled Tribes. Some reddiars are classified as Backward caste, in Kerala where they migrated to in early 1900 (excludes Malabar district where Reddiars are classified as forward). For example, Reddiars in Malabar excluding Ganjam Reddys are classified as forward. Reddiars in other districts are classified as backward since 1993. Some Reddiars in Kerala are considered protected minorities, who need better educational access due to merchantile roots of Reddiars in Kerala and lack of significant land ownership, except in Malabar district of Kerala. There is a separate section of Reddiars called Konda Reddy who were considered Shudras in British surveys, who follow tribal customs. Recently, Konda Reddys in Odissa have been pressing for inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes list.\n\nThough The Origin is thought tobe same with little arguments, Reddys predominantly speak Telugu and follow Telugu cultural festivals like Ugadi and follow all other Andhra norms. Whereas Reddiars who came to the Tamil region speak both Tamil for business and Telugu at home and identify and follow Telugu cultural norms. They also celebrate Thai Pongal, Tamil New Year and Ugadi. For survival and to maintain their Dravidian lineage, they are active in supporting local Temple societies and local political aspirations. Some have become very prominent in Dravidian nationalistic causes and are represented in Tamil literary circles as great patrons and scholars of Tamil language. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "584214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=584214", "title": "Sandy Berger", "text": "Sandy Berger\n\nSamuel Richard \"Sandy\" Berger (October 28, 1945 – December 2, 2015) was an American political consultant who served as the United States National Security Advisor for President Bill Clinton from March 14, 1997, until January 20, 2001. Before that he served as the Deputy National Security Advisor for the Clinton Administration from January 20, 1993, until March 14, 1997.\n\nBerger was born to a Jewish family in Millerton, New York, where his parents ran an Army-Navy store. He graduated from Webutuck High School in 1963, earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in government from Cornell University in 1967, and his earned Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1971. \n\nAt Cornell, Berger was a member of the Quill and Dagger society with Paul Wolfowitz and Stephen Hadley. Opposed to the Vietnam War, Berger began working for Senator George McGovern's presidential campaign in 1972. While there, he met Bill Clinton, forming a friendship that lasted for decades. Berger later urged Clinton to run for President of the United States.\n\nAfter the McGovern campaign, Berger gained experience working in a variety of government posts, including serving as Special Assistant to Mayor of New York City John Lindsay and Legislative Assistant to U.S. Senator Harold Hughes of Iowa and Congressman Joseph Resnick of New York. He was also Deputy Director of Policy Planning for the U.S. Department of State from 1977 to 1980 under Secretary of State Cyrus Vance during the Carter administration.\n\nAfter leaving the State Department, Berger went on to join the law firm Hogan & Hartson where he helped expand the firm's international law practice. As a partner, he opened the firm's first two international offices, in London and Brussels. \"Sandy Berger\", Nancy Pelosi said in 1997, \"was the point-man at ... Hogan & Hartson ... for the trade office of the Chinese government. He was a lawyer-lobbyist.\"\n\nBerger served as Senior Foreign Policy Advisor to Governor Clinton during the campaign, and as Assistant Transition Director for National Security of the 1992 Clinton-Gore Transition. Berger served eight years on the National Security Council staff, first from 1993 - 1997 as deputy national security advisor, under Anthony Lake, whom Berger had recommended for the role, and then succeeding Lake as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from 1997 to 2001.\n\nBerger was a central figure in formulating the foreign policy of the Clinton Administration, and played an integral role advancing the administration's self-described objectives of advancing \"democracy, shared prosperity, and peace.\" In President Clinton's words, \"Nobody was more knowledgeable about policy or smarter about how to formulate it. He was both great in analyzing a situation and figuring out what to do about it. His gifts proved invaluable time and time again, in Latin America, the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East.\"\n\nKey achievements during Berger's NSC tenure included the 1995 peso recovery package in Mexico, NATO enlargement, Operation Desert Fox, the Dayton Accords that ended the killing in Bosnia, the NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia that stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, the Good Friday Agreement that helped bring about peace in Northern Ireland, and the administration's policy of engagement with the People's Republic of China. In a March 2005 oral history interview at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, Berger noted, \"I think during the '90s we took China from outside the international system and brought it inside the international system, partly through trade, and economics, and otherwise.\"\n\nOn July 4, 1999, in what South Asia expert Bruce Reidel called Berger's \"finest hour,\" Berger advised President Clinton through a pivotal negotiation with Pakistan's prime minister Nawaz Sharif to pull that country's troops back from Kashmir, averting a potentially cataclysmic nuclear war with India.\n\nBerger also advised the President regarding the Khobar Towers bombing and responses to the terrorist bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In the final years of the Clinton administration, combating terrorism was the paramount foreign policy priority; Berger said in his March 2005 oral history interview at UVA's Miller Center, \"I said to Condoleezza Rice during the transition...that the number-one issue that she would deal with as national security advisor was terrorism in general and al-Qaeda specifically.\"\n\nIn November 1997, Berger paid a $23,000 civil penalty to settle conflict of interest allegations stemming from his failure to sell his stock of Amoco Corporation as ordered by the White House. Berger was advised by the White House to sell the stock in early 1994. He said he had planned to sell the stock, but then forgot. He denied knowingly participating in decisions in which he had a financial interest. With no evidence that Berger intended to break the law, the United States Department of Justice determined a civil penalty was adequate for a \"non-willful violation\" of the conflict of interest law.\n\nIn 1999, Berger was criticized for failing to promptly inform President Clinton of his knowledge that the People's Republic of China had managed to acquire the designs of a number of U.S. nuclear warheads. Berger was originally briefed of the espionage by the Department of Energy (DOE) in April 1996, but did not inform the president until July 1997.\n\nA number of Republicans, including then presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander, called for Berger's resignation. They accused him of ignoring the allegations of Chinese espionage. \"For his unwillingness to act on this serious matter, Mr. Berger should resign\", Alexander said. \"If he does not, he should be relieved of his duties by President Clinton.\" President Clinton rejected the calls: \"The record is that we acted aggressively,\" Clinton said. \"Mr. Berger acted appropriately.\"\n\nOn July 19, 2004, it was revealed that the United States Department of Justice was investigating Berger for unauthorized removal of classified documents in October 2003 from a National Archives reading room prior to testifying before the 9/11 Commission. The documents were five classified copies of a single report commissioned from Richard Clarke covering internal assessments of the Clinton Administration's handling of the unsuccessful 2000 millennium attack plots. An associate of Berger said Berger took one copy in September 2003 and four copies in October 2003, allegedly by stuffing the documents into his socks and pants. Berger subsequently lied to investigators when questioned about the removal of the documents.\n\nIn April 2005, Berger pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material from the National Archives in Washington, D.C.\n\nBerger was fined $50,000, sentenced to serve two years of probation and 100 hours of community service, and stripped of his security clearance for three years. The Justice Department initially said Berger only stole copies of classified documents and not originals, but the House Government Reform Committee later revealed that an unsupervised Berger had been given access to classified files of original, uncopied, uninventoried documents on terrorism. During the House Government Reform Committee hearings, Nancy Kegan Smith — who was the director of the presidential documents staff at the National Archives and Records Administration — acknowledged that she had granted Berger access to original materials in her office.\n\nOn December 20, 2006, Inspector General Paul Brachfeld reported that Berger took a break to go outside without an escort. \"In total, during this visit, he removed four documents ... Mr. Berger said he placed the documents under a trailer in an accessible construction area outside Archives 1 (the main Archives building)\". Berger acknowledged having later retrieved the documents from the construction area and returned with them to his office.\n\nOn May 17, 2007, Berger relinquished his license to practice law as a result of the Justice Department investigation. Saying, \"I have decided to voluntarily relinquish my license. ... While I derived great satisfaction from years of practicing law, I have not done so for 15 years and do not envision returning to the profession. I am very sorry for what I did, and I deeply apologize.\" By giving up his license, Berger avoided cross-examination by the Bar Counsel regarding details of his thefts.\n\nAfter leaving the Clinton Administration, Berger became chairman of Stonebridge International, an international advisory firm he co-founded in 2001 which focused on aiding companies in their expansion into emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India, and Russia. Stonebridge International merged in 2009 with The Albright Group, a similar firm founded by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to form Albright Stonebridge Group.\n\nIn late 2003, Berger was called to testify before the 9/11 Commission regarding steps taken against terrorism during his tenure and the information he provided to his successor, Condoleezza Rice. At the time, Berger was also acting as an informal foreign policy advisor to Senator John Kerry during his campaign for the presidency. He quit his advisory role after controversy arose regarding his preparations for testifying before the September 11 committee.\n\nBerger was also Chairman of the D.B. Zwirn Global Advisory Board, an international investment fund and merchant capital provider founded in 2001 and with offices throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Berger was an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He also served on the International Advisory Council of the Brookings Doha Center. Berger served as a foreign policy adviser to Senator Hillary Clinton in her 2008 presidential campaign. Berger served on the Board of Directors of the International Crisis Group and World Food Program USA, and also on the Advisory Boards of the National Security Network, and America Abroad Media.\n\nBerger lived in the American University Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was married to Susan Harrison Berger, and had three children.\n\nBerger died of cancer in Washington, D.C., on December 2, 2015, at the age of 70, more than a year after being diagnosed. He was survived by his wife Susan and three adult children.\n\nPresident Barack Obama released the following statement on learning of Berger's death:\n\nIn November 2015, Berger was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese government for his contributions to promotion of a strong and friendly relationship between the United States and Japan, particularly in his role as National Security Adviser to President Clinton. He also provided legal and commercial advice to the Embassy of Japan in Washington, D.C..\n\nOn December 1, 2015, World Food Program USA announced that it has given its inaugural Global Humanitarian Award to Samuel R. Berger in recognition of his decades of leadership helping families in need across the globe. Additionally, the World Food Program USA established the Samuel R. Berger Humanitarian Fund, which will support humanitarian organizations as they work to eradicate hunger around the world.\n\nIn 2000, Berger was presented with an honorary degree from Tel Aviv University in Israel.\n\n\n"}

Initial reports stated that the victim, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was a 23-year-old woman found guilty of adultery. However, Duhulow's father and aunt stated that she was 13 years old, under the age of marriage eligibility, and that she was arrested and stoned to death after trying to report that she had been raped. The execution took place in a public stadium attended by about 1,000 bystanders, several of whom attempted to intervene but were shot by the militants.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Al-Shabaab had formally charged Duhulow with adultery.\n\nIn 1991, the government of then President of Somalia Siad Barre was overthrown by a coalition of armed factions. The Islamic Courts Union (ICU) took control of the southern half of Somalia in 2006, imposing Shari'a law. In 2006, the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) assisted by Ethiopian troops re-captured the capital Mogadishu, largely driving the ICU's leaders out of the country. Al-Shabaab, the ICU's militant and youth branch, subsequently took up irregular warfare and guerrilla tactics against the allied forces. In 2008, the group was designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, which launched missile strikes against the militants early in the year. Several thousand local civilians were killed by the militants during the height of the insurgency between December 2006 and October 2008. In the months leading up to Duhulow's execution, Al-Shabaab had been gaining strength, as it had seized control of the Port of Kismayo, essentially shut down Mogadishu's Aden Adde International Airport, and dismantled pro-government roadblocks.\n\nDuhulow and her family moved to the southern city of Kismayo, Somalia from the Hagardeer refugee camp in Dadaab, Kenya in July 2008. According to one of her teachers, Muno Mohamed Osman, who had taught Duhulow for a few months and did not remember her well, she struggled during class and \"didn't look mentally fit[...] She was always in trouble with students, teachers[...] She was just a child.\" Three months after her arrival in Kismayo, Duhulow was reportedly raped by three armed men while travelling on foot to visit her grandmother in Mogadishu in October 2008. Her aunt took her to a police station to report the incident to the Al-Shabaab Islamist militia in Kismayo, which at the time controlled the city's court system. They were asked to return to the station a few days later, having been told that two suspects had been apprehended. Duhulow was subsequently arrested by the insurgents under charges that she had \"chatted up\" the men and committed adultery. She was then sentenced to death by stoning. The militant tribunal asserted that Duhulow had come to it with an admission of guilt, and that she was repeatedly asked to reconsider her confession but that she instead insisted that she wanted Sharia law and the attendant punishment to be applied. One militant, Sheik Hayakalah, stated that \"the evidence came from her side and she officially confirmed her guilt[...] She told us that she was happy with the punishment under Islamic law.\" No attempts were made by the insurgent group to apprehend Duhulow's purported attackers.\n\nOn October 27, 2008, during the afternoon, several militants transported Duhulow to a public stadium in Kismayo containing around 1,000 people. She reportedly struggled with the insurgents and at one point screamed, \"What do you want from me[...] I'm not going, I'm not going. Don't kill me.\" Four militants subsequently forced Duhulow into a dug out hole, burying her up to the neck. Around 50 militants participated in the ensuing execution, throwing rocks at her head. According to witnesses, nurses were then instructed to verify whether Duhulow was still alive. After ten minutes, she was dug out of the hole and two nurses confirmed that she was still alive, after which point Duhulow was put back in the hole and the stoning resumed. Although many witnesses to the event were too afraid of the armed militants to intervene, several bystanders attempted to save her. The insurgents responded by opening fire on them, in the process killing an eight-year-old boy. An Al-Shabaab spokesman later apologized for the child's death, and pledged that the shooter would be punished.\n\nIn December 2008, Nada Ali of Human Rights Watch (HWR) cited Duhulow as an example of females in the parts of south-central Somalia that were at the time under insurgent control who had little recourse to fair trials and health services. She stated, \"Aisha's horrific death is likely to discourage rape victims from reporting rape or seeking justice from the Islamist insurgents.\" Ali also urged the United Nations Security Council to form an international investigative commission to inquire into the worst crimes reportedly committed against civilians during the conflict.\n\nCBC journalist Debi Goodwin wrote, \"To the world, Aisha became a symbol of the dangers of extremism.\" On October 27, 2010, a \"2nd Annual Memorial Lecture\" was held by the Newcastle Amnesty Group to commemorate the second anniversary of Duhulow's death. That same year, Associate Professor Susanne Scholtz dedicated her book, \"Sacred Witness: Rape in the Hebrew Bible\" (2010), to her great-aunt, the rape victims in the Congo, and Duhulow, saying, \"I honor Aisha and what she had to endure in her young life.\"\n\nThe Al-Shabaab militia prohibited journalists from taking pictures of the stoning, but allowed them to document the event. Militants initially reported that the stoning victim was a woman who had confessed to adultery. Witnesses and local journalists estimated her age at 23 based on her appearance. A few days later, Amnesty International reported that Duhulow's father had told them that she was only 13, under the age of marriage eligibility, and that she was arrested and executed after trying to report that she had been raped. Her aunt, who had taken her to the police to report the alleged assault, reiterated the father's statement regarding her age. A human rights activist in the area subsequently informed BBC News that he had received death threats from Al-Shabaab for allegedly disseminating false information on the incident. However, he denied any involvement with the Amnesty International press release.\n\nNotable reactions by international organizations immediately after the Duhulow incident included:\n\n\nMohamed Abdullahi, director of the Somali Community Initiative in the United Kingdom, said that many Somali immigrants in the UK had been sympathetic to Al-Shabaab in the previous years and had sent funds to it. He further said, \"Over here in Britain, they are not seeing the violence that they are fuelling, or realising that al-Shabaab has some very hardline policies. Many people here were shocked to hear about the stoning incident, and said that it was not Islamic. In that case, they should think twice about sending money.\"\n\nThe African newspaper \"Maghrebia\" reported that the incident drew outrage in the Maghreb region of Northwest Africa. Bassima Hakkaoui, a Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party MP, commented, \"In principle, the state has laws which specify which party is supposed to give judgement, along with the nature of the crime. It defies logic to hand down a death sentence to a woman who has been raped.\" Islamic educationalist Hamid Baalla agreed, saying, \"You cannot describe people who resort to such actions as Muslim. These people are radicals and extremists.\" It was described as \"inhumane, barbarous\" by Moroccan Organization for Human Rights President Amina Bouayache and as \"an act of terrorism towards the Somali people, particularly women\" by women's rights activist Hind Mbarki.\n\nThe stoning was equally condemned in Tunisia and Algeria, where head of the Mounia Association for the Protection of Single Women Zakia Gawaou described the situation as unacceptable. Muslim scholar Houssine Mohamed stated, \"Adultery, in Aisha's case, was not voluntary. She was a victim of rape, as is the case of many young girls and women in Algeria who are raped by extremists. Therefore, sentencing her to death cannot be related to Islam.\" Khadija Cherif, President of the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, said, \"We condemn violence against women for whatever reason or purpose, especially violence that denies human beings of their right to live.\" Sofiene Ben Hmida, a member of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, remarked, \"This is an act committed by people who are living outside history. The danger doesn't lie with those people, but with those who just watch what they do without confronting them strongly and firmly.\" Iqbal Gharbi, professor of Sharia and Religious Principles at Zeitouna University, called the incident an \"act of barbarism worthy of denunciation\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1415899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1415899", "title": "Suburbanization", "text": "Suburbanization\n\nSuburbanization is a population shift from central urban areas into suburbs, resulting in the formation of (sub)urban sprawl. Sub-urbanization is inversely related to urbanization, which denotes a population shift from rural areas into urban centres.\n\nMany residents of metropolitan regions work within the central urban area, and choose to live in satellite communities called suburbs and commute to work via automobile or mass transit. Others have taken advantage of technological advances to work from their homes. These processes often occur in more economically developed countries, especially in the United States, which is believed to be the first country in which the majority of the population lives in the suburbs, rather than in the cities or in rural areas. Proponents of containing urban sprawl argue that sprawl leads to urban decay and a concentration of lower income residents in the inner city.\n\nIn the United States, suburbanization began to occur in mass amounts after World War II, when soldiers returned home from war and wanted to live in houses outside of the city. During this time America had a prosperous postwar economy, there was more leisure time available and an increased priority in creating a family unit. Throughout the years, the desire to separate work life and home life has increased, causing an increase in suburban populations. Suburbs are built for particular groups of people and around certain industries like restaurants, shopping, and entertainment which allows suburban residents to travel less and interact more in the suburban area. Suburbs in the United States have also evolved by increases in technology, which allows residents to work from home rather than commute.\n\nRecent developments in communication technology, such as the spread of broadband services, the growth of e-mail and the advent of practical home video conferencing, have enabled more people to work from home rather than commuting. Although this can occur either in the city or in the suburbs, the effect is generally decentralizing, which works against the largest advantage of the centre city, which is easier access to information and supplies due to centralization. Similarly, the rise of efficient package expresses delivery systems, such as FedEx and UPS, which take advantage of computerization and the availability of an efficient air transportation system, also eliminates some of the advantages that were once to be had from having a business located in the city. Industrial, warehousing, and factory land uses have also moved to suburban areas. Cheap telecommunications remove the need for company headquarters to be within quick courier distance of the warehouses and ports. Urban areas suffer from traffic congestion, which creates costs in extra driver costs for the company which can be reduced if they were in a suburban area near a highway. As with residential, lower property taxes and low land prices encourage selling industrial land for profitable brownfield redevelopment.\n\nSuburban areas also offer more land to use as a buffer between industrial and residential and retail space to avoid NIMBY sentiments and gentrification pressure from the local community when residential and retail is adjacent to industrial space in an urban area. Suburban municipalities can offer tax breaks, specialized zoning, and regulatory incentives to attract industrial land users to their area, such as City of Industry, California. The overall effect of these developments is that businesses as well, and not just individuals, now see an advantage to locating in the suburbs, where the cost of buying land, renting space, and running their operations, is cheaper than in the city. This continuing dispersal from a single city center has led to other recent phenomena in American suburbs, the advent of edge cities and exurbs, arising out of clusters of office buildings built in suburban commercial centers on shopping malls and higher density developments. With more and more jobs for suburbanites being located in these areas rather than in the main city core that the suburbs grew out of, traffic patterns, which for decades centered on people commuting into the center city to work in the morning and then returning home in the evening, have become more complex, with the volume of intra-suburban traffic increasing tremendously. By 2000, half of the US population lived in suburban areas.\n\nIn many countries of Europe, sometimes cities became seen as dangerous or very expensive areas to live, while the suburbs were seen as safe places to live and raise a family. There are periods of opposite developments like urbanization.\n\nDuring Communism, most socialist countries in the Eastern Bloc were characterized by under-urbanization, which meant that industrial growth occurred well in advance of urban growth and was sustained by rural-urban commuting. City growth, residential mobility, land and housing development were under tight political control. Consequently, sub-urbanization in post-communist Europe is not only a recent but also a particular phenomenon. The creation of housing and land markets and state withdrawal from housing provision have led to the development of privatized modes of housing production and consumption, with an increasing role for private actors and, particularly, for households. Yet, the regulatory and institutional frameworks indispensable to a market-driven housing system – including housing finance – have remained underdeveloped, particularly in south-eastern Europe. This environment has undoubtedly stimulated housing self-provision. Clearly, different forces have shaped different outcomes. \n\nLong-suppressed urbanization and a dramatic housing backlog resulted in extensive peri-urban growth in Tirana (Albania), which during the 1990s doubled the size of the city whereas war refugees put pressure on cities of former Yugoslavia. Elsewhere processes of suburbanization seemed dominant, but their pace differed according to housing shortages, available finance, preferences and the degree of 'permitted' informality. The process was slow in Prague during the 1990s and more apparent after 2000, when housing affordability improved. Conversely, Slovenian and Romanian suburban developments visibly surrounded cities/towns during the 1990s. Nonetheless, socialist legacies of underdeveloped infrastructure and the affordability crisis of transition differentiate post-socialist suburbs from their Western counterparts.\n\nVarious degrees of informality characterized suburban housing from illegal occupation of public land (Tirana), illegal construction on agricultural private land (Belgrade) to the unauthorized but later legalized developments in Romania. Suburban housing displayed a chaotic/unplanned character, especially in south-eastern Europe, where the state retains a degree of illegitimacy. Excepting scattered for-profit housing, much of the new detached suburban houses seem self-developed. Allegedly, owner-building has become a household strategy to adapt to recession, high and volatile inflation, to cut construction costs and, finally, to bridge access to housing. The predominantly owner-built feature of most suburban housing, with the land often obtained at no cost through restitution policies or illegal occupation, allowed a mix of low-/middle-income households within these developments.\n\nTijuana has experienced a strong wave of suburbanization from its urban core beginning in 2006. Historically, Tijuana city, with 1/4 the area covering 80 square miles, contained well over 95% of the total population of the municipality, and it was the poor relegated to living outside the city. Despite good highways, however, there was little incentive to move out of the city. However, with a huge escalation of the Mexico drug war violence, middle class city residents and property developers along with retail chains began building suburban communities and sold them as a way to isolate themselves and their children from the negative effects. This led to a historic movement to communities outside the urban core, as evidenced by both the type of middle class housing developments and 2010 INEGI census figures.\n\nHistorically, it was believed that living in highly urban areas resulted in social isolation, disorganization, and psychological problems, while living in the suburbs was supposed to be better to overall happiness, due to lower population density, lower crime, and a more stable population. A study based on data from 1974, however, found this not to be the case, finding that people living in the suburbs had neither greater satisfaction with their neighborhood nor greater satisfaction with the quality of their lives as compared to people living in urban areas.\n\nPre-existing disparities in the demographic composition of suburbs pose problems in drug consumption and abuse. This is due to the disconnection created between drug addiction and the biased outward perception of suburban health and safety. The difference in drug mortality rates of suburban and urban spaces is sometimes fueled by the relationship between the general public, medical practitioners, and the pharmaceutical industry. These affluent individuals, who are living in the suburbs often have an increased means of obtaining otherwise expensive and potent drugs such as opioids and narcotics through valid prescriptions. In the United States, the combination of demographic and economic features created as a result of suburbanization has increased the risk of drug abuse in suburban communities. Heroin in suburban communities has increased in incidence as new heroin users in the United States are predominantly white, suburban men and women in their early twenties. Adolescents and young adults are at an increased risk of drug abuse in suburban spaces due to the enclosed social and economic enclaves that surburbanization propagates. The \"New England Study of Suburban Youth\" found that the upper middle class suburban cohorts displayed an increased drug use when compared to the natural average.\n\nThe shift in demographics and economic statuses caused by suburbanization has increased the risk of drug abuse in affluent American communities and changed the approach to drug abuse public health initiatives. When addressing public health concerns of drug abuse with patients directly, suburban health care providers and medical practitioners have the advantage of treating a demographic of drug abuse patients that are better educated and equipped with resources to recover from addiction and overdose. The disparity of treatment and initiatives between suburban and urban environments in regard to drug abuse and overdose is a public health concern. Although suburban healthcare providers may have more resources to address drug addiction, abuse, and overdose, preconceived ideas about suburban lifestyles may prevent them from giving proper treatment to patients. Considering the increasing incidence of drug abuse in suburban environments, the contextual factors that affect certain demographics must also be considered to better understand the prevalence of drug abuse in suburbs; for example, adolescents and their relationship with social groups in school and other socializing forces that occur as a result of suburbanization impact drug abuse incidence.\n\nThe economic impacts of suburbanization have become very evident since the trend began in the 1950s. Changes in infrastructure, industry, real estate development costs, fiscal policies, and diversity of cities have been easily apparent, as \"making it to the suburbs\", mainly in order to own a home and escape the chaos of urban centers, have become the goals of many American citizens. These impacts have many benefits as well as side effects and are becoming increasingly important in the planning and revitalization of modern cities.\n\nThe days of industry dominating the urban cores of cities are diminishing as population decentralization of urban centers increases. Companies increasingly look to build industrial parks in less populated areas, largely for more modern buildings and ample parking, as well as to appease the popular desire to work in less congested areas. Government economic policies that provide incentives for companies to build new structures and lack of incentives to build on Brownfield land also contribute to the flight of industrial development from major cities to surrounding suburban areas. As suburban industrial development becomes increasingly more profitable, it becomes less financially attractive to build in high-density areas. Another impact of industry leaving the city is the reduction of buffer zones separating metropolitan areas, industrial parks and surrounding suburban residential areas. As this land becomes more economically relevant, the value of such properties very often increases, causing many undeveloped landowners to sell their land.\n\nAs America continues to sprawl, the cost of the required water lines, sewer lines, and roads could cost more than $21,000 per residential and non-residential development unit, costing the American government $1.12 trillion over the next twenty five years. Along with the costs of infrastructure, existing infrastructure suffers, as most of the government's money that is dedicated to improving infrastructure goes to paying for the new necessities in areas further out from the urban core. As a result, the government will often forgo maintenance on previously built infrastructure.\n\nFor residential properties, suburbanization allows for home prices to decrease, so people can drive until they can find an area in which they can afford to buy a home. However, these homes may lack certain things such as parks and access to public transit. Also, the prices of homes in downtown center usually decrease as well to compete with the inexpensive homes in the suburbs. One of the main benefits of living in the suburbs is that one gets a much larger piece of land than one would in the city. Therefore, as the size of lots increases, the supply of housing is more limited. This is to mean that as city growth patterns increase the population increases leading to suburbanisation which hence leads to the under development of real estate since it is a business.\n\nThe fiscal deficit grows as a result of suburbanization, mainly because in less densely populated areas, property taxes tend to be lower. Also, because of the typical spread pattern of suburban housing, the lack of variety of housing types, and the greater distance between homes, real estate development and public service costs increase, which in turn increase the deficit of upper levels of government.\n\nAs the trend of suburbanization took hold, many of the people who left the city for the suburbs were white. As a result, there was a rise in black home ownership in central cities. As white households left for the suburbs, housing prices in transition neighborhoods fell, which often lowered the cost of home ownership for black households. This trend was stronger in older and denser cities, especially in the northeast and Midwest, because new construction was generally more difficult. As of the 2010 Census, minorities like African Americans, Asian Americans and Indo-Americans have become an increasing large factor in recent suburbanization. Many suburbs now have since 1990 large minority communities in suburban and commuter cities.\n\nEnvironmental Impacts\n\nWith the growth of suburbanization and the spread of people living outside the city this can cause negative impacts on the environment. Suburbanization has been linked to the increase in vehicle mileage, increase land use, and increase in residential energy consumption. From these factors of suburbanization, it has then caused a degradation of air quality, increase usage of natural resources like water and oil, as well as increased amounts of greenhouse gas. With the increased use of vehicles to commute to and from the work place this causes increased use of oil and gas as well as an increase in emissions. With the increase in emissions from vehicles, this then can cause air pollution and degrades the air quality of an area. Suburbanization is growing which causes an increase in housing development which causes an increase in land consumption and available land. Suburbanization has also been linked to increase in natural resource use like water to meet residents' demands and to maintain suburban lawns. Also, with the increase in technology and consumptions of residents there is an increase in energy consumption by the amount of electricity used by residents.\n\nSuburbanization has negative social impacts on many groups of people, including children, adolescents, and the elderly. Children who are affected by suburbanization, or urban sprawl, are commonly referred to as \"cul-de-sac kids.\" Because children living in a suburb cannot go anywhere without a parent, they are unable to practice being independent. Teenagers that are unable to be independent experience a lot of boredom, isolation, and frustration. These feelings have even led to an increase in rates of teenage suicide and school shootings in suburban areas. Despite these issues with young people, suburbia was still intended for young families. The elderly in suburbia experience social isolation once they lose their license to drive. In order to leave their home the elderly need to be able to afford a chauffeur or be willing to ask relatives to drive them around. This has resulted in upper-class elderly moving to retirement communities. Both the wealthy elderly and those who still live in suburbs are largely separated from all other groups of society.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

Net assets exceeded $6.2 million, including property and equipment valued at more than $5.3 million. Programs are supported by a diverse group of local and national sponsors, such as Wells Fargo, Jet Blue, Whole Foods, Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Ketel One, Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, and AHF AIDS Healthcare Foundation.\n\nSAGE, \"the country's largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of LGBT older adults,\" is one of the center's most popular programs, including \"398 active members\" with \"175 LGBT seniors attending weekly get-togethers.\" In August 2016, SAGE estimated there are \"43,000 LGBT older adults in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.\"\n\nThe agency organizes an annual Tropical Plant Fair each spring, including several dozen vendor booths.\n\nThe Pride Center grew out of the initial vision of founder Alan Schubert, one of the earliest public leaders of Fort Lauderdale's gay and lesbian community. Schubert died of cancer on June 1, 2016. He was 70 years old. Schubert's legacy includes the Pride Center where the main building bears his name and a long history of financial support and bringing community resources together on behalf of causes that included \"the Broward Gay and Lesbian Youth Group, the Child Care Connection, the Jewish AIDS Network, Broward Public Library, Human Rights Campaign, Center One and Tuesday's Angels.\"\n\nUpon his death, The Pride Center said: Alan Schubert's \"impact on this community and beyond is immeasurable. In 1993, Schubert--philanthropist and gay pioneer--conceived the idea for the then Gay and Lesbian Community Center of South Florida. Alan determined that a safe community center in Fort Lauderdale could assist existing and new groups serving the LGBTQ communities.\"\n\nIn August 2016, a partnership between the Pride Center and Carrfour Supportive Housing secured financing to develop, build and operate South Florida's first supportive housing community that will significantly serve gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender seniors. Carrfour's competitive application for tax credits won funding from Florida Housing Finance Corporation for \"housing credit and gap financing for affordable housing developments for persons with a disabling condition,\" providing the financing needed to begin construction of The Residences at Equality Park as an initial 48-unit apartment complex on the Pride Center's campus at North Dixie Highway and Northeast 20th Drive in Wilton Manors, Florida.\n\nThe effort to create affordable, supportive housing in Wilton Manors began in 2012 when City Commissioner Tom Green proposed development of affordable housing for the community's primarily LGBT seniors. Three years later, the proposal won unanimous support from the City Commission to create \"12,346 square feet of retail space and 130 affordable housing units\" within The Pride Center's five-acre campus. Pride Center formally partnered with Carrfour to pursue funding, develop and operate the housing complex.\n\nSince 2010, Pride Center Florida has published a quarterly newsletter, known as the Pride Center Voice. The newsletter is distributed in print and electronically. The organization also maintains an active social media presence, including on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\n"}
{"id": "21502793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21502793", "title": "Urban planner", "text": "Urban planner\n\nAn urban planner is a professional who practices in the field of urban planning. \n\nAn urban planner may focus on a specific area of practice and have a title such as city planner, town planner, regional planner, long-range planner, transportation planner, infrastructure planner, environmental planner, parks planner, physical planner, health planner, planning analyst, urban designer, community development director, economic development specialist or other similar combinations.\nAn international association of planning professionals - ISOCARP - was established in 1965 in the Netherlands and currently has about 700 members in more than 80 countries. \n\nThe responsibilities of an urban planner vary between jurisdictions, and sometimes within jurisdictions. The following is therefore a general description of the responsibilities of an urban planner, of which an urban planner may well typically practice two or more of. An urban planner may also specialize in one responsibility only.\n\nUrban planners specializing in land use planning are predominantly concerned with the regulation of land use, development and subdivision, with the intent of achieving the desired urban planning outcome.\n\nRegulation of land use and development is achieved via the drafting and adoption of planning instruments designed to influence the land use and built form goals of the jurisdiction. The planning instruments take the form of legislation and policy, and have a wide variety of terms across jurisdictions including acts and regulations, rules, codes, schemes, plans, policies, and manuals; and often a combination of some of these. The planning instruments often spatially zone land or reserve the land for certain purposes, presented in the form of a zoning map or plan. The urban planner is tasked with preparing planning instruments and zoning plans. Further, given urban development is rarely static and the goals of urban planning change from time to time, the urban planner will be responsible for continuously maintaining planning instruments and zoning plans to ensure they are kept up-to-date.\n\nConsultation with the community and other stakeholders is generally desired by urban planners in most jurisdictions when planning instruments are prepared and updated. The level of consultation will vary depending on the project.\n\nThe urban planner will also be responsible for implementing the planning instruments. This is achieved through a permit process, where the proponent of a proposed development, a change in land use, or the proposed subdivision of an allotment will be required to obtain a permit, approval, licence, or consent for the proposed development or change of use. An urban planner will be tasked with considering the proposal and determining whether it complies with the intent and the specific provisions of the applicable planning instruments and zoning plans. Depending on the jurisdiction, the urban planner may have authority to determine the proposal; otherwise the planner will present a recommendation to the decision-maker, often a panel of non-planners (for example, the elected council of a local government).\n\nWhile concerned with future development, an urban planner will occasionally be responsible for investigating development or land use which had been undertaken without authorization. In many jurisdictions urban planners can require that unauthorized land use cease and unauthorized development is returned to its predevelopment condition; or alternatively retrospectively approve the unauthorized development or land use.\n\nIn order to plan effectively for long term development and growth, an urban planner will be responsible for the preparation of a strategic plan (also known in different jurisdictions by names such as development plan, core strategy, comprehensive plan, planning strategy, structure plan, etc.). Strategic urban planning sets the high-level goals and growth principles for a jurisdiction, which will in turn inform the preparation and amendment of the legal planning instruments within that jurisdiction.\n\nRegional planning deals with the planning of land use, infrastructure and settlement growth over a geographical area which extends to a whole city or beyond. In this sense, the urban planner's role is to consider urban planning at a macro scale. Regional planning is not concerned with planning at the local (neighborhood) level.\n\nAn urban planner may be responsible for identifying, protecting and conserving / restoring buildings and places which are identified by a community as having cultural heritage significance. This may include the task of compiling and maintaining a heritage register, finding and making available incentives for encouraging conservation works, and the consideration of proposals to redevelop or use a heritage-listed place.\n\nAs urban areas decline, an urban planner may be tasked with preparing a plan for the redevelopment of an urban area. Such plans are not limited to an individual development site, but rather encompass a locality or district over which an urban renewal (or redevelopment) plan is prepared.\n\nUrban renewal often relies on obtaining funding from government sources to assist in the regeneration of an area; the funding may be used for a variety of purposes such as improvement of public roads, parks and other public spaces, development of infrastructure, and acquisition of land. The urban planner will be responsible for costing an urban renewal plan and obtaining funding for infrastructure works necessary to implement the urban renewal plan.\n\nThe urban planner for an urban renewal project will need to liaise closely with stakeholders during the preparation and implementation of the plan, including government agencies, landowners and community groups.\n\nA master plan will be prepared for many greenfield development projects. The purpose of a master plan is to plan for the ultimate spatial layout of the land uses for a future development area. A master plan will consider the required infrastructure to service the development and determine the need and location of urban amenities including commercial and industrial land, community facilities, schools, parks, public transport, major roads, and land uses, both within and outside the master plan area, and consider the staging of development of a master planned area.\n\nThe urban planner will be responsible for coordinating the various professional consultant inputs, and to lay out the master plan infrastructure and land uses. It will often be necessary for the urban planner to consult with landowners and government agencies affected by the master plan.\n\nAn urban planner may be responsible for planning for transport facilities and infrastructure in urban and inter-regional areas.\n\nAn urban planner's responsibility may extend to economic development. In this sense, an urban planner may be responsible for identifying opportunities for economic growth, and encourage investment in an area.\n\nAn urban planner may be concerned with the impact of land use, development and subdivision on the natural environment including land, water, flora, and fauna, to achieve sustainable outcomes.\n\nAn urban planner will develop the design of public spaces (streets, squares, parks, etc.) and the relationship between built form and public spaces. Depending on the country and planner's training they may work with other design professionals such as civil engineers, architects or landscape architects to complete and construct the design.\n\nAn urban planner may be required to plan for the future provision of public works infrastructure such as water supply, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications, and transport infrastructure, and community infrastructure including schools, hospitals and parks.\n\n\"See Urban planning education for a discussion of this topic.\"\n\nUrban Planning as a profession is a relatively young discipline. Few government agencies restrict or license the profession. As a result, a number of other related disciplines actively claim to have the training, expertise and professional scope to practice urban planning. While organizations such as the American Planning Association, the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Royal Town Planning Institute certify professional planners, others in related fields like Landscape Architecture also claim to have professional autonomy in urban planning. Efforts internationally have attempted to define the role of urban planners through licensure acts. The State of New Jersey licenses Professional Planners. The Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Alberta protect the title of Registered Professional Planner to only those who have an accredited CIP education and experience or equivalent.\n\nUrban planners in Canada usually hold bachelor's degrees in planning or a master's degree, typically accredited as an M.Pl, MUP (Master of Urban Planning) MCP (Master of City Planning), MScPl, MES (Master of Environmental Studies) or simply an MA.\n\nUrban planners in Greece typically graduate from Engineering faculties. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and University of Thessaly are the two universities that provide undergraduate studies in urban planning in Greece.\n\nThough planning is not a recognized profession under Indian law, the profession began in 1941 with the School of Planning and Architecture as a Department of Architecture of Delhi College of Engineering now the Delhi Technological University. It was later integrated with the School of Town and Country Planning which was established in 1955 by the Government of India to provide facilities for rural, urban and regional planning. On integration, the school was renamed as School of Planning and Architecture in 1959. Today, it is one of the premier schools of pursuing planning studies at bachelor, masters and post doctorate levels.\n\nThe Institute of Town Planners, India (ITPI), set up on the lines of the Royal Town Planning Institute in London is the body representing planning professionals in India. A small group formed itself into an Indian Board of Town Planners which after three years of continuous work formed the ITPI. The institute, which was established in July 1951, today, has a membership of over 2800, apart from a sizable number of student members, many of whom have qualified Associateship Examination (AITP) conducted by ITPI. As of 2012, the institute has 21 regional chapters across India.\nSchool of Planning and Architecture(SPA),Delhi is one of the premier institute in dissemination knowledge of Architecture and Planning in India. It was established in 1941.In 1979, the Government of India, through the then Ministry of Education and Culture, conferred on the School of Planning and Architecture the status of \"Deemed to be a University\"(http://spa.ac.in/Home.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f)\nSchool of Planning and Architecture-Bhopal (M.P.) and School of Planning and Architecture-Vijayawada established in year 2008 by Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.\nCentre for Environment Planning and Technology (CEPT) University in Ahmedabad and Malaviya National Institute of Technology (NIT) Jaipur, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (N.I.T) in Bhopal along with NIT Patna are one of the pioneering Institutes in India where urban planning is taught.\n\nThe Israel Planners Association was founded in 1965. Urban planning is taught by the Technion Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning in Haifa and the Center for Urban and Regional Studies.\n\nUrban planners in Mexico typically graduate from an Architecture background provided by major universities in the country. Most of such degrees can be awarded at Masters' graduate studies, although there are also bachelor's degrees available.\n\nA planner brings professional expertise and knowledge to the development and implementation of policy in the interests of productive, liveable and sustainable environments. Planners support communities and provide leadership in making informed choices about the consequences of human actions and in bridging the gap between the present and the future. Planners must consider and balance a range of strategic, policy, technical, legal, administrative, community and environmental factors in their contributions to informed decision-making.\n\nPlanners are employed in diverse public and private roles. They use their knowledge and experience in various institutional and community settings to provide leadership, undertake research, solve problems, evaluate alternatives and outcomes, manage change, and envision, advise on and enact desirable future directions.\n\nIn applying their expertise, planners must be aware of and responsive to cultural, social, economic, environmental, ethical and political values. In New Zealand, these include the bicultural mandate for planning, including the partnership relationships established by the Treaty of Waitangi/te Tiriti o Waitangi, and New Zealand’s increasingly multicultural society.\n\nA key attribute of a planner is the ability to work across disciplinary and institutional boundaries and to integrate knowledge from a range of disciplines within the distinctive framework of the discipline of planning.\n\nA professional planner is someone who has gained a professional qualification through tertiary study, continues to learn post qualification, undertakes continuing professional development, is a member or is working towards becoming a member of the New Zealand Planning Institute (NZPI), contributes to the planning profession, and is committed to upholding the principles and ethical practices of the planning profession.\n\nFor a list of NZPI recognized degrees, click here. \n\nIn Nigeria, the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP) and the Town Planners Registration Council (TOPREC) are the leading bodies tasked with the responsibility of improving the training, education and professional practice of planning in Nigeria.\n\nTo be a town planner in Nigeria, first must complete a degree in Urban and regional planning or a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in Urban and regional planning which must be accredited by the Town Planners Registration Council (TOPREC ), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member, and subsequently register and sit for the TOPREC professional examination, to become a registered town planner.\n\nThe South African Council for Planners (SACPLAN) is the statutory Council of nominated members appointed in terms of the Planning Profession Act, 2002 (Act 36 of 2002) by the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform (Department of Rural Development and Land Reform) to regulate the Planning Profession(Planning is both the organizational process of creating and maintaining a plan) in terms of the Act. The Planning Profession Principles applies to all registered planners. The SACPLAN through the Act assures quality in the planning profession through the identification of planning profession work that only registered planners can undertake. The functions of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 7 of the Act. The powers and duties of the SACPLAN are contained in Section 8 of the Act. The Act further prescribes a Professional Code of Conduct for registered planners \n\nThose wishing to be a town or country planner, in the United Kingdom, first must complete a degree in a relevant discipline and then complete a final year in the form of a masters in town and country planning which must be accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI), or a four-year degree encapsulating all aspects. they can then become eligible to be a member of the RTPI, but must first complete two years work based training, to be a full member.\n\nTown planners in the UK are responsible for all aspects of the built environment, wherever you are within the UK a town and country planner will have at sometime planned the built aspects of the environment. They (Local Planning Authorities) grant planning permission (consent) to individuals, private builders and corporations and also aid local government with their decisions.\n\nPlanners in the U.S. typically complete an undergraduate or graduate degree from a university offering the program of study. Professional certification is only offered through the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP), a branch of the American Planning Association. To gain AICP certification, a planner must meet specific educational and experience requirements, as well as pass an exam covering the nature and practice of the discipline. Although AICP certification is not required to be a practicing planner, it does serve as a means in which a planner can verify his or her professional expertise.\n\nPlanners in Palestine took responsibility after the Palestinian Authority took governance in the West Bank and Gaza- Palestine. Planners have been trained by a Norwegian consultants As Plan Viak at the very beginning as part of the institutional capacity training project funded by the Norwegian Government. Both Birzeit and Alanjah Universities run bachelor and master degree in planning and planners could specialized in different fields.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "291993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=291993", "title": "Volunteer fire department", "text": "Volunteer fire department\n\nA volunteer fire department (VFD) is a fire department composed of volunteers who perform fire suppression and other related emergency services for a local jurisdiction.\n\nVolunteer firefighters contrast with career firefighters, who work full-time and receive a full salary. Some volunteer firefighters may be part of a combination fire department that employs both full-time and volunteer firefighters.\n\nIn some communities, the definition of a volunteer firefighter includes those who receive some pay for being on call and/or attending emergencies, known in other countries as \"retained\" firefighters. Volunteer and retained firefighters are expected to be on call to respond to emergency calls for long periods of time, and are summoned to the fire station when their services are needed. They are also expected to attend other non-emergency duties as well (training, fundraising, equipment maintenance, etc.).\n\nThe earliest firefighting organizations were made up volunteers. The first large organized force of firefighters was the Corps of Vigiles, established in ancient Rome in 6 AD.\n\nThe first volunteer fire department in Argentina was Bomberos Voluntarios de La Boca (La Boca Volunteer Firemen) founded on June 2, 1884, by Italian immigrant Tomas Liberti in the neighborhood of La Boca, Buenos Aires. June 2 is the Day of Volunteer Firefighters. The Argentina Federation of Volunteer Firefighters was founded in 1954. In 2018, 80% of the country is covered by volunteers.\n\nThroughout Australia there are many volunteer firefighting agencies which are set up by the individual states or territories. New South Wales is serviced by two statutory firefighting authorities. These are the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSWRFS) and Fire and Rescue NSW. Fire and Rescue NSW has firefighting and rescue responsibilities for the major cities, metropolitan areas and several other towns in NSW. It also has the responsibility for all land based HAZMAT incidents as well as inland waterway based HAZMAT incidents. The NSWRFS is the volunteer firefighting service in NSW and consists of over 70,000 volunteers and has responsibility for over 90% of the land area in NSW. Although most of this is bush and grass land, the NSWRFS also serve smaller and regional communities that are not covered by Fire and Rescue NSW. Despite some overlapping in firefighting coverage/resources by both services, the NSWRFS does not provide rescue or HAZMAT services in the State.\n\nIn Victoria, there are three main fire fighting organisations, Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (MFB), Country Fire Authority (CFA) and The Department of Environment, Water, Land, and Planning (DEWLP). The CFA is a volunteer and community based fire and emergency services organisation that is made up of around 61,000 members. Of these members, some 59,000 are volunteers. Their roles range from fire, rescue, HAZMAT, to non-operational support roles.\n\nIn Western Australia, fire fighting is organised by the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) together with Local Councils. DFES operate the Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service Brigades (VFRS) and some Bush Fire Service Brigades (BFS), while the remainder of the Bush Fire Service Brigades are trained by DFES, but operated and administrated by the Council of the associated area. VFRS Brigades are generally more involved in Structural Fire fighting, Asset Protection and Road Crash Rescue depending on their location, whereas the BFS Brigades are generally more involved in Wildfire Fighting. In Western Australia there is an estimated 31,000 BFS Members among 585 Brigades, and 2,000 VFRS Members among 88 Brigades.\n\nIn South Australia, there are two legislated fire fighting organisations. The South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service (SAMFS) and the South Australian Country Fire Service (SACFS). The SACFS is staffed by approximately 13,500 volunteer fire fighters and around 120 paid employees.\n\nVolunteer fire departments (\"Freiwillige Feuerwehr\") provide the majority (97% of all German fire fighters) of Austria's and Germany's civil protection services, alongside other volunteer organizations like the Germany Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW), voluntary ambulance services and emergency medical or rescue services like German Red Cross or Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe. In most rural fire departments, the staff consists only of volunteers. The members of these departments are usually on-call 24/7 and working in other professions.\n\nThe alarm can be performed by different alarm systems, such as by sirens or pager. In Germany, the alarm via radio pager is on the frequencies of the radio. In Austria, the fire departments have their own frequencies.\n\nIn medium-sized cities and communities, fire departments will often be partially staffed by career firefighters. They ensure the rapid availability of some of the department's fire apparatus, with the remaining apparatus staffed and brought to the scene of the emergency by volunteers as soon as they arrive at the department.\n\nLarger cities, typically those with 100,000 inhabitants or more, will operate fire departments staffed entirely by career firefighters. However, they also typically have several volunteer fire departments, who are called upon in case of larger emergencies.\n\nMunicipalities are the support of volunteer fire departments. Additional funding may include, for example, contributions from support organizations, donations made in fundraising or income from various events.\n\nVolunteer fire departments are mostly found in rural and remote areas of Canada, with 127,000 such firefighters across the country. Most urban and larger fire services began as volunteer service and evolved into full-time members. Volunteer departments are necessary for areas that cannot afford to staff a full-time department.\n\nChile is the only country in the world in which all firefighters are unpaid. The local fire departments are part of the National Board of Firefighters (\"Junta Nacional de Bomberos\"). Since the Great Fire of Valparaíso in April 2014 a long debate has been going on whether firefighters should be paid.\n\nIn Finland the firefighting in the countryside mostly depends on volunteer fire departments, nearly always with a contract with the regional emergency authorities (or, formerly and in Åland, the municipality). There are volunteer fire departments also in cities, but there with a minor role.\n\nIn Indonesia, the city with the biggest number of volunteer fire brigades is Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan province. The city is also sometimes nicknamed \"kota seribu pemadam kebakaran\" (The city with a thousand of fire brigades). Access of water is also relatively easy as rivers are easily founded at the city to be the source of water for fire fighting. The need of more fire brigades in the city emerged when people realized the very frequent incidents of fire, especially structure fire because houses are traditionally made out of wood, and also hence the hot temperature near the equator, fire incidents are common, thus many people made and become volunteer fire brigades to assist the existing government fire brigade (the \"Dinas Pemadam Kebakaran\"). These volunteer fire brigades are paid Rp 0.000,- but in some cases, some people give them money for charitable reasons.\n\nThe Auxiliary Fire Service (AFS) in the Republic of Ireland is a branch of the national civil defence organisation. The service is usually only called upon for flooding incidents, emergency water supply and large-scale incidents where the resources of front-line fire brigades are stretched.\n\nIn Nicaragua there are three different groups of firefighters, one ruled by the Direccion General de Bomberos 18 fire station which has government support and the other two Federación de Cuerpos de Bomberos de Nicaragua Benemeritos with 8 fire station and Asociacion civil Cuerpo de BOMBEROS Voluntarios de Nicaragua 24 fire station are volunteers firefighters around the Country.\n\nPeru's \"bomberos\" are all unpaid volunteers that put out fires, clear up hazardous materials, aid in natural disasters, and bring the sick to hospitals, in a 150-year tradition. Citizens apply to enter a training program they must pay for with their own money. There they’ll learn how to put out fires, provide first aid and use specialized equipment. If they complete the program they enter a probation period where they have to prove they are capable of dealing with real-life emergencies.\n\nState Fire Service () is a professional firefighting service that covers whole territory from their stations in cities and towns. In rural areas however, local inhabitants may create a Voluntary Fire Service (\"Ochotnicza Straż Pożarna\") under proper law. Such volunteer fire service may receive a financial help from the government for the equipment and staff training. In certain areas of Poland almost every village has a volunteer fire service because members of such enjoy high respect in their community. On the other hand, volunteer fire service is fully integrated with the emergency system. Any call to fire emergency number is routed to the nearest State Fire Service station which firstly deploys the nearest volunteer fire service and later aids them with the state forces.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the only autonomous volunteer fire service is the Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade, which is contracted to provide operations for Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service. Other voluntary fire brigades existed in the past, but no others have existed since the disbanding of the Auxiliary Fire Service in 1968.\nIt is standard for smaller, rural stations to be manned by retained firefighters, who are part-time firefighters who live or work in the vicinity of a fire station and spend long periods of time on call. There are some voluntary units that are part of a regular fire service, such as the Borth Voluntary Fire Unit is under the command of Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service also have some volunteer-operated stations.\n\nAccording to the National Fire Protection Association, 69 percent of firefighters in the United States are volunteers. The Volunteer Firefighter Alliance represents Volunteer Firefighters across the U.S., as well the National Volunteer Fire Council represents the fire and emergency services on a national level, providing advocacy, information, resources, and programs to support volunteer first responders. The NVFC includes 49 state-based firefighter associations such as the Firemen's Association of the State of New York (FASNY), which provides information, education and training for the volunteer fire and emergency medical services throughout New York State.\n\nVolunteer firefighters go through some or all of the same training as career personnel do; this too varies between jurisdictions. When volunteers join a department, they often sign up for firefighting classes and other certifications that teach them what they need to know to become a volunteer firefighter. Examples of these certifications include Firefighter I, Firefighter II, S-130/S-190, Emergency Medical Responder, and Emergency Medical Technician. Some departments also require recruits to complete a certain amount of in-house training. During this time, often called the probationary period, the recruit is known as a probationary firefighter, or \"probie\". Once the probationary period is complete, the member is eligible to become a full firefighter.\n\nIn the United States, the Department of Labor classifies volunteer firefighters as firefighters that receive no compensation or nominal fees up to 20% of the compensation a full-time firefighter would receive in the same capacity. The DOL allows volunteer firefighters to receive benefits such as worker's compensation, health insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, pension plans, length of service awards, and property tax relief. DOL-defined volunteer firefighters may be paid nominal fees on a per call basis, per shift basis, or various service requirements, but may not be compensated based on productivity such as with an hourly wage.\n\nThe terms \"part paid\" and \"paid on-call\" refer to firefighters that are receiving some compensation less than the compensation a full-time firefighter would receive. It may often refer to volunteer firefighters that do not qualify as volunteers under the United States Department of Labor. They may also volunteer time for training, public education, fund-raising, and other non-emergency department related activities.\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century American slang, volunteer firefighters were referred to as \"vamps\", though the origin of this is obscure.\n\nA VFD may be financially supported by taxes raised in a city, town, county, fire district, or other governmental entity, as well as corporate and other private donations, federal grants, and other assistance from auxiliary members, or firefighters' associations.\n\nWith these funds the VFD acquires and operates the firefighting apparatus, equips and trains the firefighters, maintains the firehouse, and possibly also covers insurance, worker's compensation, and other post-injury or retirement benefits. A VFD (or its governing entity) may also contract with other nearby departments to cover each other in a mutual aid (or automatic aid) pact as a means for assisting each other with equipment and manpower, when necessary.\n\nDepending upon the location and availability of other services, a VFD may be responsible for controlling structure fires as well as forest fires. Because it may be the only emergency services department for some distance, a rural VFD may also be fortunate to include community first responders, emergency medical technicians, Hazardous Materials response, and other specially qualified rescue personnel. Law enforcement officers may also be trained in these related duties and overlap with the VFD. The VFD may also have duties as the local fire inspectors, arson investigators, and as fire safety and prevention education, in addition to being the local civil defense or disaster relief liaison.\n\nA volunteer fire department is normally reached the same way as other emergency services, such as by calling 9-1-1 or 1-1-2. A central dispatcher then calls out the VFD, often through equipment such as pagers, radios, or loud signals, such as a fire siren. Average response times are longer than with full-time services because the members must come from different distances to the station or to the incident. Such departments often have a fixed number of firefighters on staff at any given point in time, which sometimes equals the minimal numbers recommended. Some states allow the use of Length of Service Award Programs (LOSAPS) to provide these volunteer departments with a tool to assist in recruiting and retaining members. LOSAPS are simple programs that can be implemented with minimal taxpayer expense.\n\nSome volunteer fire departments allow the use of Courtesy lights or emergency lights and sirens by its members. In most states that allow both lights and sirens, this is a red light and siren that gives the responding member the same privileges as other emergency vehicles. In other jurisdictions, this may be a green or blue light without a siren. The use of such equipment varies from fire district to fire district based on need for fast response, distance that members live from the fire station, the size and amount of other traffic in the fire district as well as local and state law. Some departments restrict or prohibit use of such emergency lights, even when allowed by state law, due to the increased risk of traffic accidents involving volunteers responding in emergency mode. In some states, volunteer firefighters and EMTs are eligible to receive specialty license plates for personal vehicles that identify them as trained emergency services personnel.\n\nOperational volunteer fire department members receive some form of training, either in a formal or informal setting, depending on the state and regulatory authority. The level and type of basic and specialty training varies across the country. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has several published standards for fire fighter qualifications and training, including Standard for Fire Service Professional Qualifications Accreditation and Certification Systems, and Fire Fighter Professional Qualifications. These standards apply to both volunteer and career fire fighters.\n\nNew members are referred to as \"recruits,\" \"rookies,\" \"probies\" (short for \"probationary\"), or even \"red hats\" in some departments that require the recruit to wear special gear or markings (such as a red helmet in some departments) to denote their ranking. Some departments allow (or even require) new recruits to ride along on fire apparatus as observers before undergoing the rigors of further fire training.\n\nFire fighters typically progress through formal Fire Fighter I and Fire Fighter II training in accordance with national standards.\n\nSpecialty training can include wildland firefighting, technical rescue, swift water rescue, hazardous materials response, vehicle extrication, FAST team, fire instructor, fire officer and others.\n\nA VFD may hold an \"open house\" at their station. The event serves many purposes including demonstration, training, drill, fundraising and recruitment. There is no particular format for the VFD open house. It can be formal or informal. The goal is to get public involvement in the VFD efforts. It is recommended that the open house should include demonstrations of equipment and show and tell. This allows the public to understand how the volunteers are organized in their local community and it is used as a public relations tool. The combination of demonstrations and drills allow the public and prospect volunteers to see volunteer fire fighters in action while they are participating in the practices.\n\n\n"}

In Brazil, they inhabit the northeast of Roraima State.\nIn Venezuela, the Ye'kuana live alongside their former enemies, the Sanumá (Yanomami subgroup).\n\nWhen the Ye'kuana wish to refer to themselves, they use the word So'to, which can be translated as \"people\", \"person\".

{"id": "29797103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29797103", "title": "Zafimaniry", "text": "Zafimaniry\n\nThe Zafimaniry are a sub-group of the Betsileo ethnic group of Madagascar. They live in the forested mountains of the southern central highlands southeast of Ambositra, between the neighboring Betsileo and Tanala peoples. There are approximately 100 Zafimaniry villages, which support a population of approximately 25,000. The Zafimaniry speak a dialect of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group which comes from the Barito languages, that are spoken in southern Borneo.\n\nThey are known for their woodcarving knowledge and art, which was added in 2003 to UNESCO's list of the world's Intangible Cultural Heritage. This style of woodworking was once common throughout Madagascar but has decreased because of deforestation. Their art is considered by historians to provide insight into the applied arts of the past in Madagascar.\n\nThere are an estimated 25,000 Zafimaniry in Madagascar today. The Zafimaniry are descendants of both the Betsimisaraka and Tanala ethnic groups, but are differentiated from both primarily by the nature of the damp and cold mountain forests where they settled. In former Zafimaniry areas where the forest has been lost and terraced rice cultivation has begun, these communities are considered Betsileo by the \"real\" Zafimaniry who still live in forests and maintain their traditional way of life.\n\nThe Zafimaniry people migrated to the dense forests of southeastern Madagascar in the 18th century due to increasing deforestation in other parts of the island.\n\nZafimaniry villages were among those targeted for retaliation by French soldiers during the 1947 Uprising against colonial rule, leading many villagers to flee to the forest where they lived nomadically for two years. The Zafimaniry community was not particularly involved in the uprising but suffered disproportionately because their villages were located along the route taken by major instigator communities in the southeast to reach French encampments in the central highlands, leading the French to believe the Zafimaniry were complicit. As French forces \"secured\" various portions of Zafimaniry territory, they arrested the local inhabitants and sent them to concentration camps, sometimes burning down the villages as well.\n\nZafimaniry society is comparatively less hierarchical than that of the Merina people. This has historically manifested as an opposition to centralized government. They are generally non-violent and place a high degree of value on civility and politeness, as well as gentleness in regards to disciplining children.\n\nThe climate of Zafimaniry country is highland rainforest, where the weather is often cold and damp. The area sits at an altitude of 1,000-1,800 meters and the weather is usually cloudy, resulting in only around 100 rain-free days per year (2,000-3,000 mm of rain received annually). The largest Zafimaniry town is Antoetra, with a population of around 1000. There are 17 larger Zafimaniry villages, and around 100 in total, although only Antoetra is accessible by car.\n\nMonogamous marriage and family life are seen as central to the stability of society. The value placed on this vision of family is symbolically represented in the construction and decorations of Zafimaniry homes. Zafimaniry women tend to marry much earlier than men and become mothers at a young age. By contrast, young men have an extended adolescence during which time they engage in \"young men's activities\" like hunting and long-distance trading. Young people's pairings are fluid and even a formal marriage can end without complications; it is the birth of children that serves to cement a relationship. Parents are considered more successful as adults when they are able to raise a larger number of children. Older family members (\"raiamandreny\") are respected leaders in the community and set an example of harmonious communal living by speaking calmly and politely with reference to proverbs and the respect due to ancestors.\n\nThe Zafimaniry historically had a slave class, and although slavery officially ended with French colonization in 1896 (but did not truly end in practice until the mid-1930s), the Zafimaniry still identify descendants of this group as members of the slave class. These members of the slave class, who at most made up 10% of the total population and were generally captives (including foreigners) and disgraced Zafimaniry, were never dispersed throughout Zafimaniry country or owned by individual masters. Rather, they were clustered in just two villages that had a historic role as hosting a sort of court where disputes were resolved, the largest being Antetezandrotra. They served these administrative units by fetching salt from the coast and other such errands but otherwise lived daily lives more or less indistinguishable from the free Zafimaniry. Nonetheless, these two groups do not intermarry. Slaves had no access to land unless it was granted to them by a free Zafimaniry, and this tended to be the exhausted land that free people had allowed to go fallow, where sweet potatoes might still manage to grow.\n\nThe free Zafimaniry class is expected to marry other Zafimaniry in order to form social alliances that will provide them with access to new land for cultivation. Since the descendants of slaves could not marry free Zafimaniry to access land, they often choose a spouse from former slave castes in the areas where they migrate for seasonal wage labor. Consequently the descendants of slaves have more relatives outside of Zafimaniry country and are better able to send their children to live with relatives to attend higher quality schools outside Zafimaniry country; the descendants of Zafimaniry slaves are therefore better educated on average than the free Zafimaniry.\n\nOriginally, Zafimaniry culture did not have a well defined religion. Traditional beliefs revolved around respect for ancestors and for \"Zanahary\", translated by European missionaries as \"God\", but representing an indifferent and ever-present force akin to fate or destiny, and manifested through the forces of nature. Beginning in the late 1800s, members of the London Missionary Society began converting free Zafimaniry villages to Protestantism. Jesuit missionaries also conducted heavy outreach to the Zafimaniry in the mid-1930s, particularly including members of the recently freed slave class, who became the primary Catholic converts.\n\nThe Zafimaniry are celebrated for their woodworking skills. Their homes are built entirely of wood without using nails. Houses and all other wooden household items including furniture, tombs and tools are decorated with symbolic geometric patterns that blend Arab and Austronesian influences. Unlike most other ethnic groups in Madagascar, the Zafimaniry place a much greater importance on building houses, rather than tombs, that are durable and well decorated. Fire is applied to harden wood used for the fabrication of blowpipes and arrows. The woodworkers use over 20 types of trees, each with their own specific properties and uses. Their woodworking style was formerly widespread across Madagascar but has largely died out and is now largely preserved only among this ethnic group. In 2008, Zafimaniry woodworking was inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nIt is also believed that the Zafimaniry have retained other original Malagasy cultural practices and beliefs that have died out in other parts of the island. For example, there is an association between the circumcision ceremony and death; the child to be circumcised is ritualistically measured for his coffin before the operation is carried out. They also practice the ancient tradition of erecting tall standing stones to commemorate an ancestor or an important event in the ancestor's life. Traditional clothing was made of beaten bark cloth.\nThe dead are entombed in wooden tombs placed in the forest. Ritualized wrestling matches, which often resemble a form of dance, take place at Zafimaniry funeral ceremonies.\n\nThe \"lokanga\" is a musical instrument much favored among the Zafimaniry. Its shape is symbolic of a coffin.\n\nThe Malagasy language is spoken by Zafimaniry as it is by the rest of the Malagasy ethnic groups. Their dialect is nearly identical to that of the Betsileo, who border them to the west.\n\nHistorically, all community members were woodworkers. However, heavy deforestation has reduced the availability of wood, diminishing the viability of livelihoods based on this skill. In recent years the Zafimaniry villages have increasingly promoted tourism to generate income, but this new form of livelihood is increasingly changing the nature of the communities who were formerly somewhat secluded. Tourism allows them to sell wooden carved handicrafts to passing hikers, and they also sell these items to suppliers who resell them in larger towns like nearby Ambositra. The Catholic former slave class largely monopolized the sale of wooden handicrafts to tourists until the 1970s because the mass production of these items was first organized by local Catholic converts with support from the church; although most Zafimaniry are now involved in this sector, the Catholic ex-slaves still dominate in terms of production, distribution and sale. Zafimaniry also harvest wood from the forest for sale. Most tour guides who organize tourist visits to Zafimaniry villages are from the former slave village of Antetezandrotra.\n\nThe Zafimaniry primarily grow maize and beans and have been traditionally reliant on \"tavy\" (slash-and-burn agriculture). The average Zafimaniry man spends 22 days a year on clearing agricultural land through tavy, while the remainder of his time can be dedicated to other income earning activities like wood carving or migrating to find seasonal work elsewhere. Maize, which was probably adopted by the Zafimaniry around 200 years ago, is now their staple crop. Fields are burned each year at the start of the planting season, and are cultivated for four to ten years before their fertility is depleted and they are left fallow for around five years before being planted again. As a field becomes less fertile, maize and bean cultivation is abandoned in favor of potatoes and sweet potatoes. Cassava is the last crop to be grown in a field before it is allowed to go fallow During the fallow period, the Zafimaniry use the fields for other purposes, such as for grazing cattle, growing medicinal plants, and growing non-food plants, bushes and trees for fibers and construction material. After seventy years of this fertile-fallow cycle, the Zafimaniry stop cultivating the land plot entirely and allow it to become permanently fallow pasture land. They supplement their corn, taro and beans with wild products gathered in the surrounding forests, particularly including honey and crayfish.\n\nRecent efforts to introduce intensified crop production with an emphasis on rice grown year after year in the same field, have been somewhat successful. Rice cultivation in this historically cold region has been made easier in recent decades due to global warming. This is largely due to the exhaustion of Zafimaniry land for traditional swidden agriculture, which has forced the Zafimaniry to find a way to adopt rice cultivation despite the unadapted nature of the mountainous terrain where they live. The terrain and climate require highly complex terracing and irrigation systems that the local population lacks the knowledge to build, so they are required to hire Betsileo specialists to construct their paddies. Most cash income the Zafimaniry use is invested in the construction of terraces for rice cultivation.\n\n\n\n"}
