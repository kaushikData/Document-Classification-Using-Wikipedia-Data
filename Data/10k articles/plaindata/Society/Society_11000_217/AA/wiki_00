No casualties were reported. It has been speculated that the event is linked to the recent proclamation of the so-called \"Republic of Ilirida\". The same building was attacked by RPGs in 2007. The National Liberation Army (NLA), the militant organization that fought against the Macedonian government in the Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia (2001), claimed responsibly for the attack. In a press release published by Alsat M, an Albanian-language TV station in Macedonia, and signed by \"Commander Kushtrim\", the organization claimed that the \"Hasan Prishtina\" elite force hit the government building in a coordinated action. The organization claims it is \"discontented\" with the 2001 Ohrid Agreement peace plan.\nOn 21 April 2015, a group of 40 armed men with NLA patches attacked the border police station at Goshince. The group tied the policemen and beat them, then stole the arms and communication devices; they stayed for a couple of hours, filming the event, and before they left for Kosovo, they issued this message through an interpreter: \n\nA shootout erupted during a police raid between police forces and an armed group identifying as the NLA occurred on 9 May 2015 in the northern town of Kumanovo.\n"}

{"id": "8364409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8364409", "title": "Anarchism and Orthodox Judaism", "text": "Anarchism and Orthodox Judaism\n\nThis article describes some views of notable Orthodox Jewish figures who supported anarchism, as well as various themes within the scope of the Orthodox Jewish tradition or among the practicing Orthodox Jews that are generally considered important from the anarchist worldview. As is often the case with pro-anarchist movements and personal anarchist opinions in spiritual traditions, authoritative organized Orthodox Jewish bodies may view some of the views described here as marginal. Anarchism found a number of notable supporters among Orthodox Jews in the first half of the 20th century; on the other hand, a number of notable secular Jewish anti-authoritarians noticed some anarchic tendencies in traditional Judaism.\n\nOne post-denominational movement in Judaism, where the views described in this article are common, is Jewish Renewal or Neo-Hasidism.\n\nWhile there is no organized Orthodox Jewish anarchist movement similar to Christian anarchist movements, a number of pro-anarchistic ideas are found in the works of some Kabbalists and Hasidic teachers, as well as in the Jewish folk religion. A few Jewish mystical groups in Antiquity were based on anti-authoritarian or radically communal principles, somewhat similar to the Christian Quakers, Dukhobors and other similar movements. Some secular Jewish anarchists, such as Abba Gordin and Walter Benjamin, were interested in the connections between anarchism and biblical and Talmudic themes, as well as Jewish mysticism. Aharon David Gordon and Martin Buber, both of whose ideas were close to anarchism, were former Orthodox Jews and greatly influenced by the Hasidic tradition.\n\nSome Jewish anarchists of the 20th century explicitly combined contemporary radical thought with traditional Judaism, insisting that, in their view, Judaism calls for abolition of the state, private property and class society. These Orthodox Jewish anarchists personally observed the Halacha, but supported the social system of communist anarchism or anarcho-syndicalism.\n\nBritish Orthodox Rabbi Yankev-Meyer Zalkind, was an anarcho-communist, a close friend of the anarchist thinker Rudolf Rocker, and an active anti-militarist, who was jailed by the British authorities for his anti-war activism. Rabbi Zalkind was also a prolific Yiddish writer and a prominent Torah scholar, who authored a few volumes of commentaries on the Talmud. He believed that the ethics of the Talmud, if properly understood, are closely related to anarchism.\n\nThe famous Kabbalist Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag believed in a religious version of libertarian communism, based on principles of Kabbalah, which he called altruist communism. Ashlag supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled internationalist voluntary communes, who would eventually dismantle the government and the system of law enforcement. However, most contemporary followers of the Ashlagian Kabbalah seem to be unaware of his anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian political stance.\n\nRussian revolutionary and Territorialist leader Isaac Nachman Steinberg, whose ideas were essentially anarchist, although he defined himself as a left eser or left narodnik, was an Orthodox Jew. Like Martin Buber, Steinberg supported the idea of binational solution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict and tried to establish a compact self-ruled Jewish settlement somewhere else outside the Middle East.\n\nRabbi Abraham Yehudah Khein (1878–1957), a prominent follower of the Hasidic Chabad tradition, was eloquently committed to pacifism and non-violence during the days when the Jewish community in Palestine was battling the Arabs and the British. He tried to relate his readings of Leo Tolstoy and Pyotr Kropotkin to Kabbalah and Hasidism. Rabbi Khein deeply respected Kropotkin, whom he called \"the Tzadik of the new world\", whose \"soul is as pure as crystal\"\n\nRabbi Yehudah-Leib Don-Yakhia from Chernigov, another \"Chabadnik\", was known as a Tolstoyan and frequently quoted Leo Tolstoy in his synagogue sermons.\n\nRabbi Shmuel Alexandrov, also close to Chabad Hasidism, was an individualist anarchist, whose religious thought was marked by some degree of antinomianism.\n\nThe Bible indicates, that the pre-monarchic Israelite society was anarchistic: \"In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\" (Judges, 21:25); The prophet Samuel harshly criticized the Jews for trying to establish a monarchy. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, referring to the above-mentioned verse, believed, that the future society will be libertarian communist.\n\nThe Essenes were a monastic Jewish sect that flourished from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD. Although the Essenic society was divided into four strictly hierarchic orders, they rebelled against the establishment, lived a radically communal life, kept a vegetarian diet and supported themselves by manual labor, usually agricultural. New initiates to Essenism took some vows, including an oath not to force personal views or authority on others.\n\nEldad ha-Dani was a merchant and traveler of the ninth century, who professed to have been a citizen of an \"independent Jewish state\" in eastern Africa, inhabited by people claiming descent from the tribes of Dan (hence his name, \"ha-Dani\" = \"the Danite\"), Asher, Gad, and Naphtali. According to his travel narratives, there is somewhere in the world a large land, encircled by the mysterious river Sambation, inhabited by descendants of Moses. The inhabitants of this land have beautiful houses and live happy, wealthy and extremely long lives; they are all equal and farm their land by themselves, because they don't have servants; no one of them locks their doors at night, because they would consider it a shame; unlike the other tribes described in the story, no king or authority is mentioned.\n\nEldad ha-Dani's fanciful travel narratives were accepted by his contemporaries as true and were very popular in the Jewish world until recent times. Even today, there are a few people, who believe that this mysterious land exists, perhaps somewhere in a parallel dimension. Regardless of the factual truth of Eldad ha-Dani's account, it indicates that many medieval Jews believed that such a utopian society is possible and has been actually implemented.\n\nAccording to Eastern European Jewish legends, before the establishment of the Hasidic movement by the Baal Shem Tov, there existed a secret society of Kabbalists, who hid their mystical knowledge and refrained from public positions and honors. Some of these mystics, according to the legends, had establishing self-ruled agricultural settlements, which emphasized individual autonomy, solidarity and compassion, closeness to nature and living by their own labor. The sixth Lubavitcher rebbe, Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, said that the village of Lyubavichi took its origin from such a settlement, established by a mystic, named Reb Meyer, whose love to his fellows, both Jews and non-Jews, was boundless, and who also showed great compassion to all living beings. According to the legend, the village was originally named \"Luba\", meaning \"love\" both in Russian and Polish.\n\nSome Hasidic rebbes had proposed social structures that emphasize equality and anti-authoritarian principles. Kalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piasetzno had organized a mystical circle of Hasidim, focused on spiritual development and meditation. Rabbi Shapiro had insisted that his organization should refrain from choosing the chairman, vice chairman etc., as it was a custom in many organizations, because \"in a place, where holiness is revealed, there is no rulership and honors\".\n\nAnother example of Hasidic anti-authoritarianism are some sectors of the Breslov community, who refuse to obey any contemporary authorities and follow only the teaching of Rebbe Nachman and his disciple, Reb Noson. The Breslov community in general is very decentralized and includes followers of diametrically opposite political opinions, such as far-right settlers of the West Bank, as well as universalistic thinkers and apolitical contemplatives.\n\nSome Hasidic masters, including Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbica and Zadok of Lublin, emphasize individual choice, freedom, spontaneity and dynamism of thought and action.\n\nAccording to the Hasidic panentheistic view, God is the true nature of all reality and the true self of the human soul (\"the soul of the souls\"). All duality and multiplicity is an illusion, resulting from the Tzimtzum. The contemporary Hasidic researcher Immanuel Schochet had described this view as monistic acosmism. Everything in the world is ever-changing and lacks intrinsic reality, while the only true reality – God – is beyond all definitions and boundaries, including time, space, personality and even substantial existence. Such views of reality are common in the Chassidic literature, although many contemporary Chassidim are unaware of these teachings and might consider them too esoteric.\n\nThe appearance of God as a personal being in the world of Atzilut is also a result of the Tzimtzum and, according to the teachings of the Lubavitcher rabbi, is a reflection of the to-be-created human personality, though some other Chassidim might consider such views bordering on heresy. In Kabbalistic and Hasidic literature, God is commonly called \"Ein Sof\" (the Infinite) or, sometimes, \"Ayin\" (Nothingness). The purpose of \"worshiping\" God is the realization of the Absolute Reality and unification with it.\n\nSuch esoteric views of God differ radically from conventional monotheism and resemble the Eastern concepts of Nirguna Brahman, Suchness and Dharmakaya. Thus, Mikhail Bakunin's and Daniel Guérin's critique of religion can be only partly applied to such a theology.\n\nAccording to the Hasidic esoteric philosophy, the Halacha is not a set of laws, imposed by an external authority (since in panentheistic view God is never \"external\"), but a framework of means for spiritual self-development, somewhat similar to the Eastern concept of Dharma. The reward of fulfilling the commandments is the inner development itself; the punishment for the sin is the destructive spiritual impact of certain actions. Thus, the religious laws are seen as natural (and, at same time, divine and supernatural), as the laws of physical nature. Halacha itself is open to inquiry, though actual change or violation of halachic norms, according to traditional Hasidism, usually requires extensive expertise and mystical knowledge, and should be taken with great caution. According to some Kabbalists, in the Messianic world the standardized Halacha will be abolished, because everyone will realize his/her personal spiritual path by personal intuition. Such views are very common in the classic Chassidic literature, although many contemporary Chassidim might consider these teachings too esoteric and view the Halacha primarily as \"law\".\n\nThere are two clearly anti-authoritarian passages in the Mishnaic tractate Pirkei Avot: \"Love labor, hate mastery over others, and avoid a close relationship with the government\" (Avot, 1:10); \"Be careful with the government, for they befriend a person only for their own needs. They appear to be friends when it is beneficial to them, but they do not stand by a person at the time of his distress\" (Avot 2:3).\n\nAnother passage in Pirkei Avot lists four possible social relationship schemes: \"He who says, 'What's mine is mine and what's yours is yours', is the median type, though some say that this is the quality of Sodom. He who says, 'What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine', is a simple (or, according to other readings, an ignorant) man. He who says, 'What's mine is yours and what's yours is yours', is a pious man ('Hasid'). And he who says, 'What's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine', is wicked.'\" (Avot, 5:13). According to Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag, consistent application of this ethical rule by all members of the society leads to voluntary communism.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, some Jews practiced usury against the non-Jews, while condemning it within the Jewish community. Most medieval rabbis approved of such practice, which helped the Jews to survive in antisemitic states, where they were excluded from most professions. However, a number of prominent rabbis explain that usury is unethical in nature, and is not allowed against people, who treat Jews well. Emphasis on cooperative productive word and criticism of wage labor and of profit from financial operations is found in some Judaic ethical treatises, including \"Sefer HaBrit\" by Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu of Vilna, Tiferet Israel by Israel Lipschitz, and Memoirs of Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, the sixth Lubavicher Rebbe.\n\nTraditional Judaism is often viewed as a national religion, concerned mostly with internal affairs. However, many well known Torah scholars called for international solidarity, cooperation and compassion. For example, the Lithuanian-born Rabbi Pinchas Elijah Horovitz, the author of \"Sefer haBrit\", who lived in 18th century Galicia, had insisted that the Jews are obligated to love their neighbors, Jews and non-Jews alike, like themselves. He called for compassionate international solidarity, mutual aid and cooperative labor.\n\nRabbi Elijah Benamozegh, an Italian Orthodox Kabbalist, strongly supported religious universalism and political internationalism.\n\nContemporary Judaism rejects capital punishment and, at least in theory, almost never advocates physical coercion, except for some rare cases, such as forcing a husband who refuses to give a get to his wife, who wants to be divorced. However, historically Judaism (as laid down in the Torah) did mandate, at least in theory, the death sentence for certain crimes, provided that certain requirements are met, namely two eyewitnesses and the perpetrator being warned of (and acknowledging) the punishment if they were to carry out the crime. This however requires participation of active Sanhedrin (the supreme court of Jewish law) which is presently non existent. The only exception to that rule is the case of the \"moyser\" (\"informer\") who threatens the life of others by informing the authorities; such a person could be killed, in principle, even today.\n\nWhile Tanakh contains many violent stories of military conquest, capital and collective punishment for various sins, the Talmud and the later commentators tend to interpret these stories not literally or reduce them to unique one-time contexts. For example, the Talmudic requirements for corporal punishments are so complicated and unrealistic, that render them virtually impossible even in the biblical times and certainly impossible today. The Talmud says, that a Sanhedrin, who would put someone to death even once (or, according to another version, more than once) in 70 years, deserves to be called a \"bloody Sanhedrin\". According to Kabbalah, the purpose of these rare punishments was the spiritual \"correction\" of the sinner's soul, in order to liberate it from the Klipot.\n\nRabbi Abraham Yehudah Khein, a supporter of communist anarchism, noticed that Rabbi Akiva, one of the most prominent Talmudical sages, rejected capital punishment altogether. Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarfon said that if they and their pupils were to participate in a Sanhedrin, they would make sure that no one is ever killed.\n\nThe Talmud teaches: \"Who is mighty? One who controls his passions\" (Pirkei Avot 4:1); \"Who is the mightiest of heroes? He who makes an enemy into his friend\" (Pirkei Avot, 5:11); \"Be of the persecuted rather than the persecutor\" (Bava Kama 93a). However, a number of anti-Zionist rabbis, especially, Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, the late Satmar rebbe, condemned the violence of the Israel Defense Forces, including the Six-Day War, although many observers considered this war an act of \"preemptive self-defence\". While Judaism fully recognizes the right of military defense, many Orthodox Jews only consider it legitimate in cases of clear and unavoidable danger. Even in such cases, some anti-Zionist Jews deny the right of the State to execute such power.\n\nA few Orthodox Jewish anti-Zionist groups, especially Neturei Karta, don't support any Israel's military actions, interpret the Arab aggression as a result of the Zionist politics and reject the State of Israel altogether, because they view its existence as a heretical contradiction with the belief in the future Messianic redemption, which they usually don't see as the restoration of the Jewish statehood, but as a spiritual 'kingdom' of universal harmony and peace.\n\nThough in ancient times the Jewish religious practice centered on the Great Sanhedrin, which acted as a rabbinical legislative authority controlling the whole of ancient Judea, Modern Judaism is a principally decentralized religion that lacks a central clerical body.\n\nOften today, Rabbis are considered to be just more knowledgeable people, who serve as advisors and analyze how the Halacha applies to different situations, although some rabbinical figures and organizations impose their authority though coercive means. Some rabbis have secular jobs and refrain from being supported by the community. Nevertheless, in ultra-orthodox Haredi circles, the concept of Da'as Torah still mandates near-complete obedience to the authority of gedolim (a special cadre of especially esteemed rabbinic scholars) in every area of everyday life. This authority structure exists both in the Haredi Litvish camp and among Hasidic groups, where the Admor or Rebbe is consulted for Da'as Torah. One notable exception are the Breslov Hasidim, who tend to be decentralized and individualistic.\n\nDespite this, even in the most authoritarian Jewish communities it's very common to disobey the rabbis for various reasons, and to organize new independent groups, who would choose their own rabbis, or, sometimes, would refuse to obey any living authority. For example, some Satmar Hasidim refuse to recognize their current leadership and rely solely on the teachings of the late Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum; most Satmar Hasidim do not recognize and harshly criticise all Zionist and pro-Zionist rabbinical institutions, especially the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Some educated Orthodox Jews do not affiliate with any particular rabbi or group, and choose halachic opinions on their own, by researching rabbinical literature and comparing opinions of different rabbis.\n\nThe tradition of decentralization and somewhat critical approach to authoritarian structures is common among Orthodox Jews, especially among the Hasidim, who are divided into over 100 independent sects.\n\nThe Kabbalistic and Hasidic literature often views hierarchies, dichotomies and casual relationships as relative and overturnable, based on the ontological principle of Sefer Yetzirah, that \"the beginning is wedged in the end, and the end is wedged in the beginning\", and the monistic concepts of unity and interrelated nature of all things. For example, Malkhut, which usually represents the feminine aspects of Reality in Kabbalah, is the lowest and, at the same time, the highest of the Sephirot, because in its root it's identical with Keter; according to the teachings of Chassidus, Moses had lost some \"sparks\" of his spirituality due to the misdeeds of the Jews in the desert, because the leader is in some aspect lower the led, \"like the head, that can not go without the feet, in which aspect the feet become the head\"; the empty part of a book or a Torah scroll is considered more ontologically significant, because it enables the very existence of the text; repentance can elevate a sin to the level higher than a Mitzvah; destruction can be a creative force, like the seed, that must be destroyed in the soil, in order to grow into a new plant.\n\nIn general, the dialectic of Kabbalah often closely resembles deconstructivist philosophy.\n\nJudaism accepts that truth is relative to some extent and that the opposite Halachic opinions can both be right, although this idea is usually not generalized beyond some traditional contexts. Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twerski of Chernobyl had stated, that even contradicting descriptions of historical reality can both be, and sometimes are, true. According to Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, the true knowledge is denial of any final knowledge; when a person reaches the \"peak\" of one spiritual world, all his/her previous knowledge is nullified by the new knowledge, that he discovers in the next world. However, one must seek and follow his or her personal truth, in order to keep \"climbing\" to the higher worlds and new levels of the knowledge, which have no end.\n\nThe belief in the future restoration of the Messiah's kingdom on earth is considered one of the fundamental tenets of traditional Judaism. Some classic rabbinical commentaries, especially the Rambam, supported monarchy and viewed the future Messiah as a king in literal sense and the future Messianic redemption as restoration of the Jewish state. According to other classic interpretations, the Torah only tells what limitations are supposed to be put on the king's power and possessions, if the Jews decide to choose monarchy as an option. According to Isaac Abrabanel, the \"king\" Moshiach will be a universally accepted spiritual teacher and a judge, but not a monarch; the state will be abolished and humanity will eventually return to the original Edenic harmony. Though Abarbanel's commentary is complex and may be interpreted in a number of different ways, his view of the ideal society in not statist. Rabbi Jonathan Sachs considers Abarbanel an 'utopian anarchist' \n\nA number of Hasidic teachers consistently rejected or spiritualized the idea of a future Messianic \"kingdom\", and viewed Messiah as a compassionate teacher and advisor, but not a coercive ruler. According to such Hasidic interpretation, the Messiah will \"fight\" God's eschatological \"wars\" by providing a role model of a great Tzadik. Some Jewish mystics emphasize the concept of 'Messianic spark' or the 'inner Messiah' within every righteous individual or every human soul. According to such view, the whole humanity will attain collectively redemptive Messianic consciousness in the future.\n\nThere is a seemingly monarchist passage in the Talmud: \"Pray for the stability of the kingdom, for were it not for the fear of its authority, a man would swallow his neighbor alive\" (Avot 3:2). However, Isaac Abarbanel, Israel Lipschutz and a number of other classic commentators hold that this passage only stresses the need for social order (\"kingdom\"), which might be organized by the people, and not necessarily by the king. Some mystical commentators interpret this passage in non-literal fashion, as referring to the spiritual Divine kingdom inside every human individual, not unlike Leo Tolstoy.\n\nTalmud\n\nSimcha Bunim of Peshischa\n\nMordechai Yosef Leiner\n\nKalonymus Kalman Shapira of Piasetzno\n\nYehuda Ashlag\n\n\n"}

{"id": "362987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362987", "title": "Audie Murphy", "text": "Audie Murphy\n\nAudie Leon Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was one of the most decorated American combat soldiers of World War II. He received every military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army, as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the Medal of Honor for valor that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition. Murphy was born into a large family of sharecroppers in Hunt County, Texas. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military. Turned down by the Navy and the Marine Corps, he enlisted in the Army. He first saw action in the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily; then in 1944 he participated in the Battle of Anzio, the liberation of Rome, and the invasion of southern France. Murphy fought at Montélimar and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near Cleurie in northeastern France in October.\n\nAfter the war, Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film \"To Hell and Back\", based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in westerns. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series \"Whispering Smith\". Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.\n\nSuffering from what would today be described as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, where his grave is one of the most visited.\n\nMurphy was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy and his wife Josie Bell Killian in Kingston, Texas. The Murphys were sharecroppers of Irish descent.\n\nAs a child, Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper. He grew up in Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted in and out of the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day () to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his eldest sister Corinne and her husband, Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.\n\nThe loss of his mother stayed with Murphy throughout his life. He later stated:\n\nMurphy had always wanted to be a soldier. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he tried to enlist, but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an affidavit that falsified his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942. After basic training at Camp Wolters, he was sent to Fort Meade for advanced infantry training. During basic training, he earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Component Bar and Expert Badge with Bayonet Component Bar.\n\nMurphy was shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943. He was assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, which trained under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott. He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in Algeria in rigorous training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily. He was promoted to private first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July.\n\nWhen the 3rd Infantry landed at Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a division runner. On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì. Sidelined with illness for a week when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July, he rejoined them when they were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, while the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina.\n\nMurphy participated in the September 1943 mainland Salerno landing at Battipaglia. While on a scouting party along the Volturno River, he and two other soldiers were ambushed; German machine gun fire killed one soldier. Murphy and the other survivor responded by killing five Germans with hand grenades and machine gun fire. While taking part in the October Allied assault on the Volturno Line, near Mignano Monte Lungo Hill 193, he and his company repelled an attack by seven German soldiers, killing three and taking four prisoner. Murphy was promoted to sergeant on 13 December.\n\nIn January 1944, Murphy was promoted to staff sergeant. He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January and was unable to participate in the initial landing at the Anzio beachhead. He returned on 29 January and participated in the First Battle of Cisterna, and was made a platoon sergeant in Company B following the battle. He returned with the 3rd Division to Anzio, where they remained for months. Taking shelter from the weather in an abandoned farmhouse on 2 March, Murphy and his platoon killed the crew of a passing German tank. He then crawled out alone close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades, for which he received the Bronze Star with \"V\" device.\n\nMurphy continued to make scouting patrols to take German prisoners before being hospitalized for a week on 13 March with a second bout of malaria. Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B, 15th Infantry, including Murphy, were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May.\n\nMurphy was awarded a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star. American forces liberated Rome on 4 June, and Murphy remained bivouacked in Rome with his platoon throughout July.\n\nDuring the first wave of the Allied invasion of southern France, Murphy received the Distinguished Service Cross for action taken on 15 August 1944.\n\nAfter landing on Yellow Beach near Ramatuelle, Murphy's platoon was making its way through a vineyard when the men were attacked by German soldiers. He retrieved a machine gun that had been detached from the squad and returned fire at the German soldiers, killing two and wounding one. Two Germans exited a house about away and appeared to surrender; when Murphy's best friend responded, they shot and killed him. Murphy advanced alone on the house under direct fire. He killed six, wounded two and took 11 prisoner.\n\nMurphy was with the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment during the 27–28 August offensive at Montélimar that secured the area from the Germans. Along with the other soldiers who took part in the action, he received the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nMurphy's first Purple Heart was for a heel wound received in a mortar shell blast on 15 September 1944 in northeastern France. His first Silver Star came after he killed four and wounded three at a German machine gun position on 2 October at L'Omet quarry in the Cleurie river valley. Three days later, Murphy crawled alone towards the Germans at L'Omet, carrying an SCR-536 radio and directing his men for an hour while the Germans fired directly at him. When his men finally took the hill, 15 Germans had been killed and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star. He was awarded a battlefield commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and kept him out of combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.\n\nThe Colmar Pocket, in the Vosges Mountains, had been held by German troops since November 1944. On 14 January 1945, Murphy rejoined his platoon, which had been moved to the Colmar area in December. He moved with the 3rd Division on 24 January to the town of Holtzwihr, where they faced a strong German counterattack. He was wounded in both legs, for which he received a second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart. As the company awaited reinforcements on 26 January, he was made commander of Company B.\n\nThe Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer, setting it alight, forcing the crew to abandon it. Murphy ordered his men to retreat to positions in the woods, remaining alone at his post, shooting his M1 carbine and directing artillery fire via his field radio while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position. Murphy mounted the abandoned, burning tank destroyer and began firing its .50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans, killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him. For an hour, Murphy stood on the flaming tank destroyer returning German fire from foot soldiers and advancing tanks, killing or wounding 50 Germans. He sustained a leg wound during his stand, and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition. Murphy rejoined his men, disregarding his own injury, and led them back to repel the Germans. He insisted on remaining with his men while his wounds were treated.\n\nFor his actions that day, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The 3rd Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions at the Colmar Pocket, giving Murphy a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for the emblem.\n\nOn 16 February, Murphy was promoted to first lieutenant and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service from 22 January 1944 to 18 February 1945. He was moved from the front lines to Regimental Headquarters and made a liaison officer.\n\nThe United States additionally honored Murphy's war contributions with the American Campaign Medal, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with arrowhead device and 9 campaign stars, the World War II Victory Medal, and the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp. France recognized his service with the French Legion of Honor – Grade of Chevalier, the French Croix de guerre with Silver Star, the French Croix de guerre with Palm, the French Liberation Medal and the French Fourragère in Colors of the Croix de guerre, which was authorized for all members of the 3rd Infantry Division who fought in France during World War II. Belgium awarded Murphy the Belgian Croix de guerre with 1940 Palm.\n\nBrigadier General Ralph B. Lovett and Lieutenant Colonel Hallet D. Edson recommended Murphy for the Medal of Honor. Near Salzburg, Austria on 2 June 1945, Lieutenant General A.M. Patch presented Murphy with the Medal of Honor and Legion of Merit for his actions at Holtzwihr. When asked after the war why he had seized the machine gun and taken on an entire company of German infantry, he replied, \"They were killing my friends.\"\n\nMurphy received every U.S. military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army for his World War II service.\n\nInquiries were made through official channels about the prospect of Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, but he never enrolled. According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam.\n\nMurphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment. Upon arrival on 13 June, he was one of four assigned to Fort Sam Houston Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station and sent home for 30 days of recuperation, with permission to travel anywhere within the United States during that period. While on leave, Murphy was feted with parades, banquets, and speeches. He received a belated Good Conduct Medal on 21 August.\n\nHe was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant at a 50 percent disability classification on 21 September and transferred to the Officers' Reserve Corps.\n\nSince his military service, Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression, and he slept with a loaded pistol under his pillow. A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches, vomiting, and nightmares about the war. His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares. During the mid-1960s, he recognized his dependence on Placidyl, and locked himself alone in a hotel room for a week to successfully break the addiction. Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness, and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming. His first wife, Dixie Wanda Hendrix, claimed he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans. Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge. His poem \"The Crosses Grow on Anzio\" appeared in his book \"To Hell and Back\", but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan.\n\nIn an effort to draw attention to the problems of returning Korean War and Vietnam War veterans, Murphy spoke out candidly about his own problems with posttraumatic stress disorder. It was known during Murphy's lifetime as \"battle fatigue\" and \"shell shock\", terminology that dated back to World War I. He called on the government to give increased consideration and study to the emotional impact of combat experiences, and to extend health care benefits to war veterans.\n\nAs a result of legislation introduced by U.S. Congressman Olin Teague five months after Murphy's death in 1971, the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio, now a part of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System, was dedicated in 1973.\n\nAt the end of World War II, the 36th Infantry Division reverted to state control as part of the Texas Army National Guard, and Murphy's friends, Major General H. Miller Ainsworth and Brigadier General Carl L. Phinney, were the 36th's commander and deputy commander respectively. After the 25 June 1950 commencement of the Korean War, Murphy began a second military career and was commissioned as a captain in the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard. He drilled new recruits in the summer training camps, and granted the Guard permission to use his name and image in recruiting materials. Although he wanted to join the fighting and juggled training activities with his film career, the 36th Infantry Division was never sent to Korea.\n\nAt his request, he transferred to inactive status on 1 October 1951 because of his film commitments with MGM Studios, and returned to active status in 1955. Murphy was promoted to the rank of major by the Texas Army National Guard in 1956 and returned to inactive status in 1957. In 1969, his official separation from the Guard transferred him to the United States Army Reserve. He remained with the USAR until his transfer to the Retired Reserve in 1969.\n\nThroughout an acting career spanning from 1948 to 1969, Murphy made more than 40 feature films and one television series. When actor and producer James Cagney saw the 16 July 1945 issue of \"Life\" magazine depicting Murphy as the \"most decorated soldier\", he brought him to Hollywood. Cagney and his brother William signed him as a contract player for their production company and gave him training in acting, voice and dance. They never cast Murphy in a movie and a personal disagreement ended the association in 1947. Murphy later worked with acting coach Estelle Harman, and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan.\n\nMurphy moved into Terry Hunt's Athletic Club in Hollywood where he lived until 1948. Hollywood writer David \"Spec\" McClure befriended Murphy, collaborating with him on Murphy's 1949 book \"To Hell and Back\". McClure used his connections to get Murphy a $500 () bit part in \"Texas, Brooklyn and Heaven.\" The agent of Wanda Hendrix, whom he had been dating since 1946, got him a bit part in the 1948 Alan Ladd film \"Beyond Glory\" directed by John Farrow. His 1949 film \"Bad Boy\" gave him his first leading role. The film's financial backers refused to bankroll the project unless Murphy was given the lead; thus, Allied Artists put aside their reservations about using an inexperienced actor and gave him the starring role.\nUniversal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week (). His first film for them was as Billy the Kid in \"The Kid from Texas\" in 1950. He wrapped up that year making \"Sierra\" starring Wanda Hendrix, who by that time had become his wife, and \"Kansas Raiders\" as outlaw Jesse James. Universal lent him to MGM in 1951 at a salary of $25,000 to play the lead of The Youth in \"The Red Badge of Courage\", directed by John Huston. Murphy and Huston worked together again in the 1960 film \"The Unforgiven\".\n\nThe only film Murphy made in 1952 was \"The Duel at Silver Creek\" with director Don Siegel. Murphy worked with Siegel one more time in 1958 for \"The Gun Runners\". In 1953, he starred in Frederick de Cordova's \"Column South\", and played Jim Harvey in Nathan Juran's \"Tumbleweed\", an adaptation of the Kenneth Perkins novel \"Three Were Renegades\". Director Nathan Juran also directed \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Drums Across the River\". George Marshall directed Murphy in the 1954 \"Destry\", a remake of \"Destry Rides Again\", based on a character created by author Max Brand.\n\nAlthough Murphy was initially reluctant to appear as himself in \"\"To Hell and Back\"\", the 1955 adaptation of his book directed by Jesse Hibbs, he eventually agreed; it became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time. To help publicize the release of the film, he made guest appearances on television shows such as \"What's My Line?\", \"Toast of the Town\", and \"Colgate Comedy Hour\". The Hibbs-Murphy team proved so successful in \"To Hell and Back\" that the two worked together on five subsequent films. The partnership resulted in the 1956 western \"Walk the Proud Land\", and the non-westerns \"Joe Butterfly\" and \"World in My Corner\". They worked together for the last time in the 1958 western \"Ride a Crooked Trail\".\n\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz hired Murphy to play the titular role in the 1958 film \"The Quiet American\". Murphy formed a partnership with Harry Joe Brown to make three films, starting with \"The Guns of Fort Petticoat\" (1957). The partnership fell into disagreement over the remaining two projects, and Brown filed suit against Murphy.\n\nMurphy was featured in three westerns in 1959: he starred opposite Sandra Dee in \"The Wild and the Innocent\", collaborated as an uncredited co-producer with Walter Mirisch on the black and white \"Cast a Long Shadow\", and performed as a hired killer in \"No Name on the Bullet\", a film that was well received by critics. Thelma Ritter was his costar in the 1960 \"Startime\" television episode \"The Man\". During the early 1960s, Murphy donated his time and otherwise lent his name and image for three episodes of \"The Big Picture\" television series produced by the United States Army. He received the 1960 Outstanding Civilian Service Medal for his cooperation in the episode \"Broken Bridge\", which featured his visits to military installations in Germany, Italy, Turkey and the U.S. state of New Mexico to showcase the military's latest weaponry.\n\nWriter Clair Huffaker wrote the 1961 screenplays for Murphy's films \"Seven Ways from Sundown\" and \"Posse from Hell\". Willard W. Willingham and his wife Mary Willingham befriended Murphy in his early days in Hollywood and worked with him on a number of projects.\n\nWillard was a producer on Murphy's 1961 television series \"Whispering Smith\", and co-wrote the screenplay for \"Battle at Bloody Beach\" that year. He collaborated on \"Bullet for a Badman\" in 1964 and \"Arizona Raiders\" in 1965. The Willinghams as a team wrote the screenplay for \"Gunpoint\" as well as the script for Murphy's last starring lead in the western \"40 Guns to Apache Pass\" in 1967. Murphy made \"Trunk to Cairo\" in Israel in 1966.\n\nHe first met director Budd Boetticher when Murphy requested to be his boxing partner at Terry Hunt's Athletic Club. He subsequently appeared in the 1951 title role of Boetticher's first western \"The Cimarron Kid\". Boetticher wrote the script in 1969 for Murphy's last film, \"A Time for Dying\". Two other projects that Murphy and Boetticher planned to collaborate on – \"A Horse for Mr Barnum\" and \"When There's Sumpthin' to Do\" – never came to fruition.\n\nMurphy married actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949. Their divorce became final two years later in 1951. Four days later, he married former airline stewardess Pamela Opal Lee Archer (October 7, 1919/1920/1923 – April 8, 2010), with whom he had two sons: Terry Michael (born 14 March 1952), and James Shannon (born 1954).\n\nMurphy bred quarter horses at the Audie Murphy Ranch in what is now Menifee, California and the Murphy Ranch in Pima County, Arizona.\n\nHis horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he invested large sums of money in the hobby. Murphy's gambling left his finances in a poor state. In 1968, he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.\n\nOn 28 May 1971, Murphy was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into Brush Mountain, near Catawba, Virginia, west of Roanoke in conditions of rain, clouds, fog and zero visibility. The pilot and four other passengers were also killed.\n\nThe aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time, but who held no instrument rating. The aircraft was recovered on 31 May. After her husband's death, Pamela Murphy moved into a small apartment and got a clerk position at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles, where she remained employed for 35 years.\n\nIn 1975, a court awarded Murphy's widow, Pamela, and their two children $2.5 million in damages because of the accident.\n\nOn 7 June 1971, Murphy was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. In attendance were Ambassador to the U.N. George H.W. Bush, Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland, and many of the 3rd Infantry Division. Murphy's gravesite is in Section 46, headstone number 46-366-11, located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater. A special flagstone walkway was later constructed to accommodate the large number of people who visit to pay their respects. It is the cemetery's second most-visited gravesite, after that of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe headstones of Medal of Honor recipients buried at Arlington National Cemetery are normally decorated in gold leaf. Murphy previously requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicuous, like that of an ordinary soldier. The headstone contains the birth year 1924, based upon purportedly falsified materials among his military records. In 1974, a large granite marker was erected just off the Appalachian Trail at at 3,100′ elevation, near the crash site.\n\nCivilian honors were bestowed on Murphy during his lifetime and posthumously, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2013, Murphy was honored by his home state with the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor.\n\nSwedish power metal band Sabaton wrote a song on their 2014 studio album, \"Heroes\", also entitled \"To Hell and Back\", commemorating and recognizing Audie Murphy as one of the most decorated American veterans of World War II.\n\nDavid McClure, his collaborator on the book \"To Hell and Back\", discovered Murphy's talent for poetry during their work on the memoir when he found discarded verses in Murphy's Hollywood apartment. One of those poems, \"The Crosses Grow on Anzio\", appears in \"To Hell and Back\" attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan. Only two others survived, \"Alone and Far Removed\" and \"Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle\". The latter was part of a speech Murphy had written at a 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in Montgomery, and later set to music by Scott Turner under the title \"Dusty Old Helmet\".\n\nMurphy was a fan of country music, in particular Bob Wills and Chet Atkins, but was not a singer or musician himself. Through his friend Guy Mitchell, Murphy was introduced to songwriter Scott Turner in 1961. The two collaborated on numerous songs between 1962 and 1970, the most successful of which was \"Shutters and Boards\" and \"When the Wind Blows in Chicago\".\n\n"}

{"id": "28958994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28958994", "title": "Bangladeshis", "text": "Bangladeshis\n\nBangladeshis ( ) are the citizens of Bangladesh. The country is named after the historical region of Bengal, of which it constitutes the largest and easternmost part. Bangladeshi citizenship was formed in 1971, when the permanent residents of the former East Pakistan were transformed into citizens of a new republic. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most populous nation. Vast majority of Bangladeshis are ethnolingustically Indo-Aryan people who speak Bengali–Assamese languages native to the region and follow the Islamic religion, by far the largest of them being Bengalis. The population of Bangladesh is concentrated in the fertile Bengal delta, which has been the center of urban and agrarian civilizations for millennia. The country's highlands, including the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Sylhet Division, are home to various tribal minorities.\n\nBengali Muslims are the predominant ethnoreligious group of Bangladesh with a population of 146 million, which makes up majority of the country's population. Chittagonian people, Rangpuri people and Sylhetis form the majority in Chittagong, Rangpur and Sylhet regions respectively. The minority Bengali Hindu population in Bangladesh is over 16,238,167 which makes up 12.07% of the total country population. Non Bengali-Assamese Muslims make up the largest immigrant community; while the Tibeto-Burman Chakmas, who speak the Indo-Aryan Chakma language, are the largest indigenous ethnic group after Indo-Aryan Bengali-Assamese peoples. The Austroasiatic Santhals are the largest aboriginal community.\n\nThe Bangladeshi diaspora is concentrated in the Middle East, North America and the United Kingdom. Several hundred thousand Non-Resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) have dual citizenship in Commonwealth countries like the UK and Canada.\n\nBangladeshis have been known by several terms:\n\n\nMostafa Shuva of FCA is from Bangladesh. Approximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are Bengalis. Most are native to East Bengal. The Bengali people have hybrid multiethnic origins, including Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic ancestry. East Bengal was a prosperous melting pot for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of dialects.\n\n90% of the population are Bengali Muslims (146 million). This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest Muslim majority country after Indonesia and Pakistan. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after Arab Muslims. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the Sunni branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the Shia and Ahmadiya branches. Bengali Hindus are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 10-12 million. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after India and Nepal. There are an estimated 400,000 Bengali Christians and 500,000 Bengali Buddhists.\n\nThe Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet Division.\n\nOther than Bengali Muslims, Chittagonian people, Rangpuri people and Sylhetis form the majority populations in Chittagong, Rangpur and Sylhet regions respectively.\n\nAn estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali Muslim immigrants from different parts of South Asia. They include affluent sections of the country's merchant and business class, particularly Nizari Ismailism adherents. They also include former Stranded Pakistanis and their descendants. Bangladesh's non-Bengali Muslims are usually fluent in both Bengali and Hindustani.\n\nIn southeastern Bangladesh, the Chittagong Hill Tracts frontier has a district history. It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto-Burman tribes in Bengal during the British Raj. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory. It is home to several indigenous ethnic groups in the three hill districts of Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachari. The three largest communities in the region have a Raja as their tribal chief who is recognized by the Government of Bangladesh.\n\n\nThere are several Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman and Indo-Aryan tribes which inhabit parts of northern and northeastern Bangladesh.\n\n\n\nThe basic social unit in a village is the family (\"poribar\" or \"gushti\"), generally consisting of a complete or incomplete patrilineally extended household (\"chula\") and residing in a homestead (\"bari\"). The individual nuclear family often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (\"ghor\"). Above the \"bari\" level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.\n\nA significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as \"the society\" (\"shomaj\" or \"milat\"). Among the functions of a \"shomaj\" might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a mullah. An informal council of \"shomaj\" elders (\"matabdars\" or \"shordars\") settles village disputes. Factional competition between the \"motobdars\" is a major dynamic of social and political interaction.\n\nGroups of homes in a village are called \"Paras\", and each \"para\" has its own name. Several \"paras\" constitute a \"mauza\", the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common thatched bamboo huts.\n\nAlthough farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly.\n\nIn 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities. Dhaka is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous megacities. Other important cities include Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Jessore, Barisal, Comilla, Narayanganj and Mymensingh. Most urban centers are rural administrative towns. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of upazilas.\n\nBangladesh is noted for cultural pluralism within a Bengali Muslim majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The Bengali language is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The Bengali Language Movement sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced socialism under a secular parliamentary system. Military coups ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the free market and promoted moderate Islamism. In 1988, Islam was made the state religion. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of separation of mosque and state in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion. The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities. Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a peace treaty in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect adivasi land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of \"Bangalee\" as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.\n\nBangladeshi culture is a mainly a synthesis of indigenous Bengali and Islamic cultures. Festivals on the both the secular Bengali calendar and the Islamic calendar are widely celebrated. The tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts often follow the Burmese calendar, which reflect the country's links with Southeast Asia.\n\nThe official language of Bangladesh is Bengali, which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam and Tripura. Bengali dialects vary between different regions of Bangladesh.\n\nThe oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at Mahasthangarh and is written in the Brahmi script. The language is Magadhi Prakrit. The Bengali language developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and its written from Apabhramsa, between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern Indo-Aryan language with Assamese and Odia, but later became distinct. It became an official language of the Sultanate of Bengal, where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocubulary from Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit. Bengali is the 10th most spoken language in the world. The language was modernized during the Bengali renaissance in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including Chakma, Rohingya, Assamese, Odia and Nepali. The indigenous Bengali alphabets descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script.\n\nThe Bengali Language Movement in East Pakistan was a key catalyst of forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by UNESCO as International Mother Language Day, as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage.\n\nBangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including Santhali, Garo, Marma, Chakma and Bisnupriya Manipuri.\n\nBangladeshis Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have Arabic and Persian origins. Bangladeshi Hindus have Sanskritized Bengali surnames. Many Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. Buddhists have a mixture of Bengali and Tibeto-Burman surnames.\n\n"}

The ceremony may take place in many places, including courthouses, parks, gardens, banquet halls, hotels, and other approved venues. Many venues may also accommodate the reception. Like non-civil ceremonies, the formality and style of the ceremony depend entirely on the tastes of the couple.\n\nCivil Registration of all Births, Deaths & Marriages has been compulsory in Scotland since 1855 when the UK government passed several Acts & Bills, effectively to stop the Scottish Traditional Practice of Legal Weddings being performed by communities.\n\nIn 1847, the Scotsman said that \"Everybody knows that, by the law of Scotland, the marriage ceremony can be performed with as perfect legal effect by a blacksmith as by a clergyman.\" The government wanted to end the Scottish practice of regarding a couple as married if they stated as much in front of witnesses. Scottish Registration Bills were accompanied by Bills to reform the law of marriage. This was opposed by the Church of Scotland, concerned that the new civil weddings would discourage people from getting married in a church.\n\nIn the end, the government dropped the marriage proposals, the session clerks were paid to be registrars, and the Treasury met the cost of the new system. That allowed the bill to be passed by Parliament and approved by Queen Victoria on August 7, 1854. The new system of civil registration started on January 1, 1855.\n\nEffectively since 1855, Civil Marriage Ceremonies have not been legal in Scotland except if performed by an employee of the government, usually in a registrars office. These Civil Registrar Ceremonies are completely non-religious and are not the same as Civil Ceremonies.\n\nA Civil Ceremony remains within the local community in Scotland and is performed by a trusted member of the community, on behalf of the family & community involved. A Civil Celebrant will never force upon you or mention their own beliefs at your ceremony, nor will he/she insist that you join any religious or non-religious body in order to secure their services.\n\nA Civil Ceremony can be completely religious, completely non-religious or a little bit of both and can take place almost anywhere the family & community wish (except some religious buildings and churches) at home, in a hotel, at a castle, at sea, in the woods, in the family garden, or any location which is special to the person or persons for whom the ceremony is for. A Civil Celebrant allows you to choose readings, poems, and music based on your own values, wishes, and beliefs. A Civil Ceremony is unique and a Civil Celebrant understands the diversity of all people and his/her services reflect the cultural and social mix which is in our communities today.\n\nA Civil Ceremony is \"A Ceremony that is driven by the wishes, beliefs, and values of the person or family, not by the beliefs or ideology of the person conducting it.\"\n\nYou can get married or form a civil partnership in the UK if you’re:\n\nOnly same-sex couples can form a civil partnership.\n\nSame-sex couples can:\n\nCivil ceremonies were legalised in Australia in 1973.\n\nTo be legally married in Australia, a person must:\n\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Marriage (Introduction of Civil Celebrants of Marriages and General Amendments) Ordinance (\"the Marriage Amendment Ordinance\") came into force on 13 March 2006. It empowered the Registrar of Marriages to appoint civil celebrants of marriages and, to enable a marriage to be celebrated before a civil celebrant at any time and place, other than the office of the Registrar of Marriages or a deputy registrar of marriages (a \"marriage registry\") or a place of worship licensed under the Ordinance.\n\n"}

In 2011, Ibrahim, along with his D-Company, was number three on the FBI's \"World's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives\" list.\n\nDawood Ibrahim established a criminal syndicate in 1970s India.\n\nOther prominent members of the gang include Chhota Shakeel, Tiger Memon, Yakub Memon, and Abu Salem. The organization has a history of rivalry with the Mumbai police and other underworld dons such as Chhota Rajan, Ejaz Lakdawala, who was arrested in Canada in 2004, and Arun Gawli.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dawood Ibrahim worked for a local smuggler named Basu dada. Basu dada had a close friendship with Dawood's father, who was a police constable. However, Basu dada and Dawood had a falling-out after Basu Dada insulted the latter's father. In 1976, Dawood - along with seven of his close friends and his elder brother Shabir Ibrahim Kaskar - attacked Basu dada with empty soda bottles.\n\nAfter this incident Basu Dada's key enforcer Khalid Phelewan persuaded Dawood to start his smuggling operations, which led to the formation of the D Company. Dawood and his elder brother Shabir, with the help of Khalid Phelewan, began their smuggling operations. This ultimately led them to clash with the Pathan gang, the most influential gang in Mumbai at the time. By 1986, D Company had eliminated most of the Pathan gang leadership - emerging as the dominant gang in Mumbai.\n\nIn 1993, D-Company associates were accused of organizing the 1993 Bombay bombings. , although Dawood denies any involvement to this day.\n\nIn 1997, D-Company former member Abu Salem was responsible for the murder of T-Series founder and Bollywood music producer Gulshan Kumar.\n\nIn 2011, Indian intelligence agencies managed to link Dawood Company with the 2G spectrum case, through DB Realty and DB Etisalat (formerly Swan Telecom) promoted by Shahid Balwa. Later in March, security at CBI headquarters in Delhi was tightened after it had been suggested that D-Company might launch an attack in an attempt to destroy documents relating to the ongoing probe of the 2G spectrum case.\n\nIn 2015, a US Congressional report alleged that the D-Company was a \"5,000-member criminal syndicate operating mostly in Pakistan, India, and the United Arab Emirates,\" which has a \"strategic alliance\" with ISI and has \"forged relationships with Islamists, including Lashkar-e-Taiba and al-Qaida.\" However, the report had no political implications, and was mainly to brief lawmakers.\n\nAt times, Dawood Company has been linked to the Bollywood film industry, as well as real estate and betting businesses, from which it is said to derive considerable revenue. The 2002 film \"Company\" is based loosely on its activities, as well as its sequel (prequel to the storyline) \"D\" (2005), \"Shootout at Lokhandwala\" (2007), and \"Once Upon a Time in Mumbai\" (2010). The 2013 movie \"Shootout at Wadala\" is based on the rise of the D-Company.\n\n\n"}

Eastward of Podlaskie lie ethnically non-Polish lands, while westward ethnically non-West \nRuthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) and non-Lithuanian lands too. Today, mainly Polish and Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) is spoken in Podlaskie, while Lithuanian is preserved by the small but compact Lithuanian minority concentrated in the Sejny County.\n\nAt the end of 2009 in Podlaskie Voivodeship there were 1189.7 thousand inhabitants, 3.1 per cent of the\ntotal population of Poland. The average density of the population, the number of the population per 1 km2,\nwas 59. The urban population in the same period was 60.2 per cent of the total number of inhabitants of the voivodeship, where the percentage of females in the total population amounted to 51.3 per cent. A statistical inhabitant of Podlasie was 37.7 years old, whereas in 2008 – 37.5 years old. The latest population projection predict consistent decrease in the population in Podlaskie Voivodeship. In the next 26 years it will decrease by 117 thousand persons due to the aging of the population.\n\nIn 2009 in Podlaskie Voivodship there were 7557 marriages registered, 3.6 per cent fewer than in 2008. At the same time there were 2040 divorces decreed, 11.1 per cent more than 2008, and 117 separations, 19.9 per cent fewer than 2008. During 2009 there were 12202 live births noted, a 2.2 per cent increase over 2008. At the same\ntime 12165 people died, a 4.5 per cent more than 2008. Natural increase in 2009 reached 37 persons\n(in the previous year – 304).\n\nIn 2009 there were 10973 persons who moved to Podlaskie from other voivodeships and 400 from abroad. Conversely there were 12625 persons who moved from Podlaskie to other voivodeships of Poland and 469 out of Poland completely. The balance of migration was statistically similar to the one noted in 2008, a net decrease of 1721 persons (2008's figure was a net loss of 1698).\n\nUntil the 19th century, Podlaskie was populated by the Polish-speaking gentry, Jews (primarily in towns), and Ruthenian Orthodox and Greek-Catholics speaking a dialect related to modern Ukrainian - the so-called \"Khakhlak\" (\"Chachlak\") dialect, which derived its name from a derogatory term for Ukrainians (\"khakhol\" or \"khokhol\" being the name of the traditional haircut of Ukrainian Cossacks). In the 19th century, the inhabitants of Podlaskie were under the rule of the Russian Empire, with Southern Podlasie constituting a part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. After 1831, Russian authorities forbade the Greek-Catholic faith in northern Podlaskie and it disappeared from the area. In 1875, Russians forbade this rite in Southern Podlasie as well, and all Greek-Catholic inhabitants were forced to accept the Eastern Orthodox faith. However, the resistance of the local people was surprisingly strong and Ruthenian speakers from this area rejected the Orthodox faith. In 1874, Wincenty Lewoniuk and 12 companions were killed by Russian soldiers in Pratulin. In reaction to these measures, the Ruthenians of Podlaskie began to identify themselves with the national movement of the Catholic Poles.\n\nIn 1912, Russian authorities issued a tolerance edict that made it possible to change confessions from Orthodox to Roman Catholic (but not to Greek-Catholic). A majority of the inhabitants of Southern Podlasie changed their faith from Orthodox to Roman Catholic. At present, very few people in Podlaskie continue speaking Ruthenian (Ukrainian) and nearly all consider themselves Poles. The counties along the border with Belarus are populated by Belarusians.\n\nPodlaskie is also the cultural center of Poland's Tatar minority as well. After the annexation of eastern Poland into the Soviet Union following World War II, Poland was left with only 2 Tatar villages, Bohoniki and Kruszyniany. A significant number of the Tartars in the territories annexed to the USSR repatriated to Poland and clustered in cities, particularly Białystok. In 1925 the Muslim Religion Association - Muzułmański Związek Religijny was formed in Poland in Białystok. 1n 1992, the Organization of Tatars of the Polish Republic (Związek Tatarów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) with autonomous branches in Białystok and Gdańsk began operating.\n\nA number of Polish Tatars from Podlaskie emigrated to the US at the beginning of 20th century and settled mostly in the north eastern states (although there is also an enclave in Florida). A small but active community of these descendants of Lipka Tatars still exists in New York City. \"The Islamic Center of Polish Tatars\" in New York City until recently had its own mosque in Brooklyn (106 Powers Street, Brooklyn, NY 11211 USA, originally build in 1928).\n"}

The 2006 Nigerian census reported 3,253,169 people with disabilities, or 2.32% of the total population of 140,431,790 in that year. However, the Centre for Citizens with Disabilities, a Nigerian NGO, claims the census did not capture the full extent of disability in Nigeria, and has called on Nigeria's National Population Commission to cooperate with the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development for the 2016 census in order to measure disability more accurately.\n\nThe five most common types of disabilities in Nigeria are, in descending order, visual impairment, hearing impairment, physical impairment, intellectual impairment, and physical impairment.\n\nNigeria ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 30 March 2007 and its Optional Protocol on 24 September 2010.

This is as opposed to emphasis on social adaptation, inclusion, and empowerment as advocated by the social model of disability that is generally favored in the field of disability studies. It also found that two national umbrella DPOs, the Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAWPD) and the Association for the Comprehensive Empowerment of Nigerians with Disabilities (ASCEND), often strongly disagreed while both presuming to speak on behalf of all Nigerians with disabilities, impeding their ability to lobby the government.\n"}
{"id": "58164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58164", "title": "Drag queen", "text": "Drag queen\n\nDrag queens are people, usually male, who dress in women's clothing and often act with exaggerated femininity and in feminine gender roles with a primarily entertaining purpose. They often exaggerate make-up such as eyelashes for dramatic, comedic or satirical effect. Drag is closely associated with gay men and gay culture, however a drag queen can be of any sexual orientation. Drag queens vary widely by class and culture and dedication, from professionals who star in films to people who try drag very occasionally.\n\nThe activity, which is called \"doing drag\", has many motivations, from individual self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag queen activities among stage and street performers may include lip-syncing, live singing, dancing, participating in events such as gay pride parades, drag pageants, or at venues such as cabarets and discotheques.\n\nThe origin of the term is uncertain; the first recorded use of \"drag\" in reference to actors dressed in women's clothing is from 1870. Drag queens are typically gay men, but there are drag queens of all different sexual orientations and genders, including trans women who perform as drag queens (sometimes termed \"trans queens\"), such as Monica Beverly Hillz and Agnes Moore, known by her stage name Peppermint, and cisgender women who do, sometimes termed \"faux queens\". Drag queens' counterparts are \"drag kings\", women who dress in exaggeratedly masculine clothing; men who dress like drag kings are sometimes termed \"faux kings\".\n\nAnother term for a drag queen is \"female impersonator.\" Although this is still used, it is sometimes regarded as inaccurate, because not all contemporary drag performers are attempting to pass as women. Female impersonation has been and continues to be illegal in some places, which inspired the drag queen José Sarria to hand out labels to his friends reading, \"I am a boy\", so he could not be accused of female impersonation. American drag queen RuPaul once said, \"I do not impersonate females! How many women do you know who wear seven-inch heels, four-foot wigs, and skintight dresses?\" He also said, \"I don't dress like a woman; I dress like a drag queen!\".\n\nSome drag queens may prefer to be referred to as \"she\" while in drag and desire to stay completely in character. Other drag performers, like RuPaul, seem to be completely indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to them. In his words, \"You can call me he. You can call me she. You can call me Regis and Kathie Lee; I don't care! Just so long as you call me.\"\n\nDrag queens are sometimes called transvestites, although that term also has many other connotations than the term \"drag queen\" and is not much favored by many drag queens themselves. The term \"tranny\" has been adopted by some drag performers, notably RuPaul, and the gay male community in the United States, but it is considered offensive to most transgender and transsexual people.\n\nMany drag performers refer to themselves as drag artists, as opposed to drag queens, as contemporary forms of drag have become nonbinary.\n\nIn the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, pantomime dames became a popular form of female impersonation in Europe. This was the first era of female impersonation in Europe to use comedy as part of the performance, in contrast to the serious Shakespearean tragedies and Italian operas. The dame became a stock character with a range of attitudes from \"charwoman\" to \"grande dame\" that was mostly used for improvisation. The most famous and successful pantomime dame was Dan Leno. After World War I and World War II, the theatre and movie scenes were changing, and the use of pantomime dames declined.\n\nDevelopment of the drag queen in the United States started with the development of the blackface minstrel show. Originally the performers would only mock African American men, but as time went on they found it amusing to mock African American femininity as well. They performed in comedic skits, dances, and \"wench\" songs. These minstrel shows and their \"wench players\" were used by white men to both mock and oppress women and African Americans.\n\nThe broad comedic stylings of the minstrel shows helped develop the vaudeville shows of the late 1800s to the early 1900s. With this shift, the \"wench players\" became \"prima donnas\", and became more elegant and refined, while still retaining their comedic elements. While the \"wenches\" were purely American creations, the \"prima donnas\" were inspired by both America and European cross-dressing shows, like Shakespearean actors and castrati. With the United States shifting demographics, including the shift from farms to cities, Great Migration of African Americans, and an influx of immigrants, vaudeville's broad comedy and music expanded the audience from minstrelsy. With vaudeville becoming more popular, it allowed female impersonators to become popular as well. Many female impersonators started with low comedy in vaudeville and worked their way up to perform as the prima donna. Famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge found success in this and eventually made his way to the broadway stage performing as a woman. At this time being a female impersonator was seen as something for the straight white male, and any deviation was punished. Connection with sex work and homosexuality eventually lead to the decline of vaudeville during the Progressive Era. Both the minstrelsy and vaudeville eras of female impersonation led to an association with music, dance, and comedy that still lasts today.\n\nIn the early to mid-1900s, female impersonation had become tied to the LGBT community and thus criminality, so it had to change forms and locations. It moved from being popular mainstream entertainment to something done only at night in disreputable areas, such as San Francisco's Tenderloin. Here female impersonation started to evolve into what we today know as drag and drag queens. Drag queens such as José Sarria and Aleshia Brevard first came to prominence in these clubs. People went to these nightclubs to play with the boundaries of gender and sexuality and it became a place for the LBGT community, especially gay men, to feel accepted. As LGBT culture has slowly become more accepted in American society, drag has also become more, though not totally, acceptable in today's society.\n\nThe Cooper Do-nuts Riot was a May 1959 incident in Los Angeles in which drag queens, lesbians, transgender women, and gay men rioted; it was one of the first LGBT uprisings in the United States.\n\nThe Compton's Cafeteria riot, which involved drag queens and others, occurred in San Francisco in 1966. It marked the beginning of transgender activism in San Francisco.\n\nOn March 17, 1968, in Los Angeles, to protest entrapment and harassment by the LAPD, two drag queens known as \"The Princess\" and \"The Duchess\" held a St. Patrick's Day party at Griffith Park, a popular cruising spot and a frequent target of police activity. More than 200 gay men socialized through the day.\n\nDrag queens were also involved in the Stonewall riots, a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the LGBT community against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The riots are widely considered to be the catalyst for the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States.\n\nDuring the summer of 1976, a restaurant in Fire Island Pines, New York, denied entry to a visitor in drag named Terry Warren. When Warren's friends in Cherry Grove heard what had happened, they dressed up in drag, and, on July 4, 1976, sailed to the Pines by water taxi. This turned into a yearly event where drag queens go to the Pines, called the Invasion of the Pines.\n\nIn December 2015, Radar Productions and Michelle Tea developed the concept of \"Drag Queen Story Hour\". Launched at the San Francisco Public Library, Drag Queen Story Hour was adopted by the Brooklyn Public Library in the summer of 2016, and has since traveled to various libraries, museums, bookstores, and recreation centers, and parks across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nA drag queen may either pick or be given a drag name by a friend, sometimes called a \"drag mother\", the so named thus becoming known as a \"drag daughter\". Drag mothers and drag daughters have a mentor-apprentice relationship. Drag 'families' were part of ball culture and drag 'houses' until the 1960s.\n\nThe process of getting into drag or into character can take hours. A drag queen may aim for a certain style, celebrity impression, or message with their look. Hair, make-up, and costumes are the most important essentials for drag queens. Drag queens tend to go for a more exaggerated look with a lot more makeup than a typical feminine woman would wear.\n\nSome people do drag simply as a means of self-expression, but often drag queens (once they have completed a look) will go out to clubs and bars and perform a \"drag show.\" Many drag queens do dress up for money by doing different shows, but there are also drag queens that have full-time jobs but still enjoy dressing up in drag as a hobby.\n\nMany parts of the drag show, and of the drag queens' other intellectual properties, cannot be protected by intellectual property law. To substitute the lack of legal protection, drag queens revert to social norms in order to protect their intellectual property.\n\nA \"drag show\" is an entertainment consisting of a variety of songs, monologues or skits featuring either single performers or groups of performers in drag meant to entertain an audience. They range from amateur performances at small bars to elaborately staged theatrical presentations. Many drag shows feature performers singing or lip-synching to songs while performing a pre-planned pantomime, or dancing. The performers often don elaborate costumes and makeup, and sometimes dress to imitate various famous female singers or personalities. Some events are centered around drag, such as Southern Decadence where the majority of festivities are led by the Grand Marshals, who are traditionally drag queens.\n\n\nWhile some male music celebrities wear exaggerated feminine clothing as part of their show, they are not necessarily drag queens. For example, Boy George wears drag queen style clothes and cosmetics but he once stated he was not a drag queen. However, RuPaul is a professional drag queen performer and singer.\n\nExamples of songs where lyrics refer to drag queens:\n\n\"What Would You Do?\", airing since early 2008, has had episodes featuring drag queens.\n\nIn mid-2008, RuPaul began producing \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", a reality television game show which began airing in February 2009. The premise of the program has several drag queens compete to be selected by RuPaul and a panel of judges as \"America's next drag superstar\". It inspired the similar spin-off shows \"RuPaul's Drag U\" and \"\".\n\nIn 2018, \"Celebrity Big Brother\" featured Queen Shane Jenek (drag name Courtney Act) as one of its contestants, placing first in the season with 49.43% of the public vote.\n\nIn 2018, \"American Idol\" featured a drag queen, Adam Sanders (drag name Ada Vox) as one of its contestants. He made it to the top ten.\n\nAlso in 2018, \"So You Think You Can Dance\" featured Jay Jackson (drag name Laganja Estranja) as one of its contestants. He finished in eighth place.\n\nWhile drag queens have a prevalent status as entertainers, they play a role in educating people on gender roles and stereotyping. Professor Stephen Schacht of Plattsburgh State University of New York began introducing his and his students experiences of attending a Drag Show to his gender/sexualities class to challenge his students ideas of dichotomy. Over time he began inviting students to attend with him. He gathered from his students that after attending the drag show they had a new appreciation for gender and sexuality and often become very vocal about their new experiences in the classroom.\n\nDrag has come to be a celebrated aspect of modern gay life. Many gay bars and clubs around the world hold drag shows as special parties. Several \"International Drag Day\" holidays have been started over the years to promote the shows. In the U.S. Drag Day is typically celebrated in early March.\n\nA televised drag competition, \"RuPaul's Drag Race\", is the most successful program on the Logo television network. In 2016, the show won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. In 2018, the show became the first show to win a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program in the same year. However, its winners and contestants have yet to receive the same level of recognition as mainstream reality show contestants.\n\nRuPaul received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the television industry on March 16, 2018, making him the first drag queen to be given such an award.\n\n\n"}

It is associated with continuity and stability, and may hamper economic growth.\n\nThe American political economist Mancur Olson, in his 1984 book, \"The Rise and Decline of Nations\", first offered \"institutional sclerosis\" as a partial explanation for the divergent growth rates experienced between the winners (with relatively low post-war growth rates) and losers (with relatively high post-war growth rates) of World War II. In liberal democracies experiencing continuity and stability, interest groups form over time and grow to exact rents, becoming vested. The accumulation of vested interests and rent-seekers ultimately slows the ability of a government to reform, adapt, and secure perfectly competitive markets thanks to a related phenomenon studied by Olson: the collective action problem. This sclerosis saps an economy's dynamism and lowers growth rates. In liberal democracies with young institutions, by contrast, competition remains perfect and natural economic dynamism and creative destruction ensue, generating high growth.\n\nInstitutional sclerosis may also be applied to an institution that is effective in changing in some areas but unable to adjust to changes in other areas. Institutions can evolve efficiently either by expanding original goals to meet a changing environment or by including more members. At the same time, however, institutions or organizations face difficulties adjusting to new structures or internal policies.\n"}

Security forces suspect that La Garra heads the drug trafficking operations for the CJNG in the United States under Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \"El Mencho\"), the top leader of the criminal group. La Garra reportedly coordinates marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine shipments to Los Angeles, San Jose, Atlanta, and New York City from Mexico.\n\nUnlike his counterparts, few details are known of his criminal background. In 2008, he was arrested for his alleged participation in the murder of a family of six in Jalisco. However, when those involved were charged in an indictment, La Garra was released from prison without a public explanation. His name was not mentioned in the legal proceedings. Over the years, he rose to the top of the CJNG's leadership chain. In 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identified La Garra as one of top three leading members of the CJNG.\n\nUnlike his counterparts in the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), few official details exist of La Garra's criminal background. Mexican state authorities suspected he was involved in a 2008 murder incident case. In 25 July 2008, authorities identified La Garra as part of a gang that participated in the murder of six family members in Zapotlán el Grande, Jalisco. The six victims were Félix Bautista Lugo (aged 69); Carmen Campos Cárdenas (aged 45); her sister, Adriana Patricia Campos Cárdenas (aged 24); Roberto Bernardino Campos (aged 17), son of Carmen and stepson of Félix; and Magali and Mayra Bautista Campos (aged 8 and 7), daughters of Carmen and Félix. All but two of the victims (Roberto Bernardino and Carmen) had coup de grâce wounds. These two were stabbed and killed by asphyxia respectively. The family was originally from Zacatecas and San Luis Potosí, and had bought the house from the former Governor of Jalisco and Secretariat of Agriculture, Alberto Cárdenas Jiménez. Though the family shared a last name with the politician, he claimed that they were not blood-related to him and were only long-time friends. The family had moved to the new home two months prior to the incident because one of their relatives was kidnapped. \n\nWhen the bodies were found, investigators concluded that the victims were killed 36 and 48 hours prior to their discovery. Investigators also located a vehicle owned by the family, and discovered that one of the victims had withdrawn a large sum of money from a bank prior to the murder. Investigators later found out that the incident started as far as 4 April, when Roberto Bernardino was kidnapped and released after the family paid a large sum of money. During that incident, one former agent of Jalisco's anti-kidnapping squad came in contact with the family. He noticed that the family was wealthy and relayed that information to a kidnapping ring he was working with. They worked together to kidnap the entire family and force them to withdraw money from their bank accounts. However, Roberto Bernardino noticed that the Jalisco official and the kidnapping group were working together and was killed. The abductors then decided to murder the rest of the family to cover up their collusion.\n\nOn 1 August, La Garra and six other men were arrested for their alleged involvement in the crime. According to state officials, they stole MXN$400,000 from the family. Police officers believe this sum of money was intended to be used as ransom money by the family to pay the kidnappers for their relatives' return. Officials also seized two vehicles, multiple rounds of ammunition, two guns, and communication equipment. On 30 August 2008, a court in Jalisco formally issued seven charges for the murder. However, La Garra's name was not in any of the indictments. Authorities claimed that the case was not related to drug trafficking and was strictly a kidnapping scheme conducted by an abduction ring and an anti-kidnapping agent working for the Jalisco state government. La Garra was released from prison without any public explanation from authorities. Years after his release, La Garra's influence within the CJNG grew and he positioned himself as one of the leading members of the criminal group.\n\nIn November 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) identified La Garra as one of the top three leaders of the CJNG, along with El Mencho and Abigael González Valencia (alias \"El Cuini\"). La Garra's decision-making power and role within the CJNG is lower than El Mencho's. According to the DEA report, the CJNG was responsible for shipping wholesale amounts of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin to the United States from the border crossings in Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez, and Nuevo Laredo. The CJNG then used distribution centers in Los Angeles and Atlanta to move narcotics across the country. In the report, the DEA stated that La Garra's organization was the newest of the main drug trafficking groups in Mexico and had risen to prominence through aggressive territorial expansion. In Mexico, La Garra reportedly operates mainly in Jalisco, Colima, Guanajuato, Nayarit, Veracruz, Morelos, Guerrero, and Michoacán.\n\nAt least 26 active drug-related investigations by the DEA were open that year against CJNG members, including La Garra. In addition to him, other suspected Mexican drug lords were mentioned in the report. From the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA targeted Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, Ismael Zambada García (alias \"El Mayo\"), and Dámaso López Núnez (alias \"El Licenciado\"); from the Juárez Cartel they targeted Jesús Salas Aguayo (alias \"El Chuyín\"), Carlos Arturo Quintana Quintana (alias \"El 80\"), and Julio César Olivas Torres (alias \"El Sexto\"); from the Gulf Cartel it targeted José Antonio Romo López (alias \"Don Chucho\") and Petronilo Moreno Flores (alias \"Panilo\"); from Los Zetas and the Beltrán Leyva Cartel they targeted Óscar Omar Treviño Morales (alias \"Z-42\") and Héctor Beltrán Leyva (alias \"El H\") respectively. At least six of the eight men mentioned in the DEA reports were not wanted by the Mexican government at the time of the announcement. The DEA was looking to apprehended all these individuals, including La Garra. \n\nIn a report the following the year, the DEA increased the number of active investigations against the CJNG hierarchy to 46. La Garra was listed a main CJNG member again, along as his counterparts El Mencho and El Cuini. In addition to Los Angeles and Atlanta, the DEA reported that the CJNG also had distribution centers in San Jose and New York City. Several of the previously mentioned suspected drug lords were kept in this report, but there were some additions to the release. For the Sinaloa Cartel, the DEA included Rafael Caro Quintero; in the Gulf Cartel, they added José Alfredo Cárdenas Martínez (alias \"El Contador\"); for \"Los Zetas\" they included Juan Francisco Treviño Chávez (alias \"El Kiko\") and Juan Gerardo Treviño Chávez (alias \"El Huevo\"); and for the Beltrán Leyva Cartel they added Fausto Isidro Meza Flores (alias \"Chapo Isidro\"), Juan Francisco Patrón Sánchez (alias \"H2\"), and José Luis Ruelas Torres. \n\nSecurity forces suspect that La Garra is one of the leading coordinators of the CJNG in the United States. Based on his influence in the United States, investigators suspect that La Garra may not live in Mexico and may be residing in the United States, specifically California, where the CJNG has a major corridor through Tijuana. According to the DEA, Mexican nationals who work for drug trafficking groups may enter the U.S. legally or illegally, and try to blend in with the larger Mexican-American communities in the U.S. In some cases, these U.S.-based members may have family ties with suspected drug lords in Mexico, or have ties with the communities where the criminal group was originally from. Upon a successful career in Mexico, some U.S.-based members return to Mexico to work directly with the criminal group that employed them.\n\n\n"}

On 19 January 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of both Compean and fellow agent Ignacio Ramos, effectively ending their prison term on March 20, 2009, and they were released on February 17, 2009.\n\nCompeán was patrolling a section of border with Ramos when they spotted a man crossing the border. They stopped him in a van containing 743 pounds of marijuana, but he ran. Compeán said he thought the suspect had a gun and was going to shoot him so he fired at him first. His shot missed but his partner, hearing gunfire, fired in order to defend Compeán and \"allegedly\" hit the suspect in the buttocks. They lost sight of the man, but said they saw him on the Mexican side of the border. They mistakenly did not believe that he had been injured, so they did not report the incident even though it involved the discharge of their firearms.\n\nThe two officers were arrested after the drug smuggler, Osvaldo Aldrete Dávila, filed a complaint against them. After a two-week jury trial, Compeán was found guilty on 11 counts, including discharging a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, which by itself carries a federally mandated 10-year minimum sentence. Without that charge, both agents involved would have received far shorter sentences. Instead, Compeán was sentenced to 12 years in prison, and his partner, Ignacio Ramos, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Aldrete Dávila was granted immunity to testify against the two agents and received six border crossing visas to come to the United States and testify.\n\nThe arrest, trial, conviction and imprisonment of Compeán and Ramos has created a firestorm of controversy from those opposing illegal immigration. Efforts have been launched in the United States Congress calling on President George W. Bush to pardon the two men. On 2007-12-06 a resolution was introduced in the Congress seeking to commute their sentences.\n\nOn November 15, 2007, Aldrete Dávila, the man shot by Ramos, was arrested at a border crossing in El Paso, Texas. A sealed indictment had been issued for his arrest on a variety of drug smuggling charges. According to the indictment, his alleged crimes occurred after he testified for the United States against the agents. If convicted he faces up to 40 years in prison.\n\nThe two men appealed their case to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. On 28 July 2008 the Fifth Circuit court of appeals rejected the appeals of both Ramos and Compean.\n\nAttorneys for Compeán and Ramos argued, that among other factors, Aldrete Dávila was improperly allowed to assert his rights against self-incrimination in the trial.\n\nThey charged that in the written immunity deal with prosecutors, he was given immunity against any charges thus removing the possibility of self-incrimination during Compeán's trial.\n\nDuring oral arguments before the three-judge appeals panel, Judge E. Grady Jolly remarked that \"For some reason, this one got out of hand it seems to me ... It does seem to me like the government overreacted here.\"\n\nOn January 19, 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos.\n\nAlthough Bush commuted the two men's sentences, he did not grant them a full pardon, thus leaving Compean and Ramos with criminal records that made it hard for them to find jobs. In September 2017, US Congressman Duncan D. Hunter wrote a letter to president Donald Trump asking him to give both men a full pardon.\n\n\n"}

The Kuteb Language is influenced by the Hausa language. Most of the Kuteb live in Taraba State, Nigeria.\nRecently they have been involved in violent confrontations with other ethnic groups in which many people have been killed or forced to move.\n\nAccording to tradition the Kuteb migrated from Egypt about 1000 AD, eventually reaching their present location around 1510. \nThe Kuteb people are made of the following clans which is believed to be Children of Kuteb;\nLumbu, Ticwo, Rufu, Askaen, Bika (Zwika), Ticwo, Rubur, Tswaen, Acha, Likam, Cwumam, and the Rucwu\n\nTraditionally they engaged in farming, hunting and fishing in the fertile lands of the Benue River basin.\nThe people worshiped family idols, but also believed in a supreme being who created the world and brings health, rain and the harvest.\nThey were ruled by a paramount priest king, the Kwe Kukwen, selected by a council of elders representing the different Kuteb clans.\nA 2007 report estimated the number of Kuteb people as approximately 100,000.\nMost live in what is now Takum Local Government Area of Taraba State, Nigeria, although there are a few Kuteb villages in Cameroon.\n\nUnder the British, who took control around 1900, the Kuteb were subject to the first-class Jukun ruler, or \"Aku Uka\" of the Wukari Federation.\nIn 1914, the British made the Kwe Kukwen the only graded and third class chief in the Takum part of the confederation, with the title of Kwe Takum. He was made paramount over other peoples in the area.\nThis change was resented by other ethnic groups of Hausa, Tiv, Chamba, Kukuns and Ichen, who forced the Ukwe Ahmadu Genkwe to leave Takum and reside elsewhere.\nThe last Ukwe Takum was Ali Ibrahim, ruling from 1963 to 1996.\n\nThe earliest direction for every activity in Kuteb land revolve round the theocratic role of the Kwe Kukwen, Akwen and Council of elders called Ndufu who represent the major known sub clans and extended families. Kukwen is the Chief-Priest located in Mbarikam or Ikam or Teekum and the Akwen are the minor priests who are heads of the other clans. This practice started with Kuteb himself as the paramount chief priest / King of the Kutebs. \nThe Kwe Kukwen may be chosen from any clan. However, he must, on his election, come to reside in Teekum (Mbarikam Hill) being the ward of Likam and the Headquarters of the Kuteb Nation \nThe traditional Kuteb political system is thus federal in nature. Even though the Kutebs recognised the seniority of Likam, the other clans had some autonomy to exercise powers of maintaining peace, protecting and achieving the interest of their respective clan members. However, such power ended where collective interest and programmes of the entire nation was to begin and where the settlement of disputes between individuals and clans were brought before the Kwe Kukwen. \nIn addition to the political role the Kukwen and Akwen have a spiritual role, responsibility and authority. The roles are rooted in the religious belief of the Kutebs.\n\nIn the 1970s Takum was part of the old Benue Plateau State.\nThe local government gazette recognized three main chieftaincy stools in the Wukari Federation for the Wukari, Donga and Takum local government areas, each to be elected by their indigenous people.\nThis law was changed by the governor Joseph Gomwalk in 1975, withdrawing the sole right of the Kuteb to select the holder of the Ukwe Chieftaincy stool of Takum from one of their two royal families.\nThe new law allowed for election of a Chamba chief, while making a Jukun man chairman of the selection committee and altering the composition of the committee to include Jukun and Chamba as well as Hausa and Kuteb.\nThe justification was the changing demographics of Takum, but the result was disturbances that caused the government to ban the traditional annual Kuchichebe festival, when the land is blessed to ensure the next harvest will be fertile.\nLater, similar festivals were banned in other Wukari Federation areas due to the trouble they caused.\n\nIn October 1997 the Taraba State military administrator Amen Edore Oyakhire sent a paper called \"Comprehensive brief on the Chieftaincy Stool of Takum Chiefdom Taraba State\" to the Armed Forces Ruling Council.\nThat month seven people were killed and seven houses razed in communal violence, and 31 people were arrested.\nOyakhire said anyone suspected of involvement in the communal violence would be treated as detractors of the transition to civil rule.\nIn 1998 the Taraba State Government also set up a Peace Committee which managed to negotiate a truce between the ethnic groups.\n\nThe Kuteb have been involved in ongoing violent conflicts with their neighbors. \nAn ethnic crisis between the Jukun and Kuteb broke out in 1991.\nOn 27 December 2008 another crisis erupted in Takum over an alleged killing of a Jukun youth by Kuteb youths.\nPerhaps 20 people died and thousands took refuge in the local military barracks.\nIn 2000 there was fighting between the Jukun/Chamba and Tiv people, with over 250 villages burned. \nIn 2006 violent clashes again began between the Kuteb and the Tiv, in which many people lost their lives.\nIn a December 2008 press conference the Taraba State Governor, Danbaba Suntai, said he could see no end to the conflict.\n"}

Jordan is one of few Muslim countries to do so. However, LGBT people displaying public affection can be prosecuted for \"disrupting public morality\". A general interest gay magazine is published in Jordan. However, most LGBT persons face social discrimination not experienced by non-LGBT residents.\n\nThe British Mandate Criminal Code Ordinance criminalized homosexuality with up to 10 years in prison, until 1951 when Jordan adopted its own penal code that did not criminalize homosexuality.\nIn 1951, a revision of the Jordanian Criminal Code legalized private, adult, non-commercial, and consensual sodomy, with the age of consent set at 16.\n\nThe Jordanian penal code no longer permits family members to beat or kill a member of their own family whose \"illicit\" sexuality is interpreted as bringing \"dishonor\" to the entire family. As of 2013, the newly revised Penal Code makes honor killings, as a legal justification for murder, illegal.\n\nThe Jordanian penal code gives the police discretion when it comes to protecting the public peace, which has sometimes been used against gay people organizing social events .\n\nThe first time that the Jordanian government made any public statement regarding LGBT rights was at the Fourth World Conference on Women held in 1995.

More recently, the kingdom's United Nations delegates have also opposed efforts to have the United Nations itself support LGBT rights, although this later proposal was eventually adopted by the United Nations.\n\nThe Jordanian government also tolerates a few cafes in Amman that are widely considered to be gay friendly.\n\nBooks@Cafe opened up in 1997 and remains a popular bookstore and cafe for patrons supportive of \"creativity, diversity and tolerance\". In the twenty-first century, a Jordanian male model, Khalid, publicly came out and has been supportive of a general interest, gay-themed magazine published in Jordan. \"Growing up, it was hard for me to find topics, subjects and publications that I could relate to! In my country, most magazines rejected me and my ideas due to my young age at the time, and I felt like an outcast in my own society!\" Khalid told soginews.com.\n\nRecent reports suggest that although a large number of LGBT citizens are in the closet and often have to lead double lives, a new wave of younger LGBT people are beginning to come out of the closet and are becoming more visible in the country, working to establish a vibrant LGBT community of filmmakers, journalists, writers, artists and other young professionals. Only a few young Jordanians of the upper class are able to remain single. Most of these more \"open\" Jordanians are well educated and from prosperous middle class or wealthy families.\n\nInitial research into the LGBT community in Jordan suggests that many of the same sort of social biases and conventions that exist within the gay community in the United States or Europe, also exist in Jordan.\n\nIn 2015, the Jordanian Ministry of Interior issue a statement about LGBT rights in response to publicity surrounding an event in Amman.\nThe statement said that LGBT rights conflicts with Islam, which the Constitution stipulates is the official religion, that Jordanian law criminalize holding public meetings without prior approval and as well as public conduct that breaches the peace or the decorum of society. This statement was in response to publicity surrounding LGBT rights event that was held in Amman. A rough translation of the statement is as follows; \" The first clause: The Jordanian state is keen on respecting the Islamic dogma and the true islamic religion's doctrine which was clearly affirmed in the first article of the Jordanian Constitution that states: \"Islam is the religion of the Jordanian State\" and the provisions of the Jordanian civil law are in line with the provisions of the Islamic Sharia law, jurisprudence and customs as they are the source of legislation; therefore, recognizing LGBT groups is considered as a breach of the Islamic Sharia and subsequently the Jordanian Constitution. Any proposals by the sexually perverted to breach the provisions of Sharia Law and the general order, and for that the aforementioned proposals are considered a crime punishable by law. Second clause: Concerning the IDAHOT meeting; the government did not give its consent for it to be held, knowing that the Law of General Meetings number 7 of year 2004 and its amendments is responsible in organizing any public meeting and so the administrative governor should be informed about the meeting should it be held, which did not happen. Third clause: The Government does not possess any assuring intelligence for the existence of and official sponsorship by a foreign mission including the Embassy of the United States to the aforementioned meeting. Final clause: The government won't tolerate in enforcing the law's provisions to maintain security order and decorum while preserving its Muslim Arab principles and traditions; Therefore, we shall pursue whoever is proven to have breached these principles and submit them to the judiciary to execute the necessary legal action against them.\"\n\nIn 2017, Mashrou’ Leila, a Lebanese-based band, was banned from performing in Jordan. The ban had been issued by the Ministry of Interior, which conflicted with a previous decision by the Jordanian Tourism Board. Conservatives objected to the band's liberal attitudes and the fact that one of the members of the band is gay. \n\nIn 2014, Jordan's Cassation Court, the highest Court in Jordan, allowed a transsexual woman to change her legal name and sex to female after she brought forth medical reports from Australia. The head of the Jordanian Department of Civil Status and Passports stated that two to three cases of change of sex reach the Department annually, all based on medical reports and court orders.\n\nIn April 2018, the Jordanian Parliament passed the advanced medical responsibility law that defines \"sex change\" and \"sex reassignment\" making the first illegal and punishable with fine and jail time for any doctor who performs what the health committee in the parliament described as \"sex change\" which is changing the sex of someone who has the chromosomes, genitals and secondary characteristics of one sex.\n\nThe Media Commission regulates the commercial exhibition and distribution of films and television shows in Jordan. In 2016, the Media Commission ruled that the film \"The Danish Girl\" could not be shown publicly because it \"encouraged\" deviance and public disorder. . Printed media is regulated by the Press and Publication law.\n\nThe Press and Publication Law was amended in 1998 and 2004. The initial document prohibited the depiction or endorsement of \"sexual perversion\", which may have included homosexuality. The revised edition in 2004 has a few provisions of direct impact on LGBT rights. First, the content ban on \"sexual perversion\" has been replaced with a general requirement that the press \"respect the values of ... the Arab and Islamic nation\" and that the press must also avoid encroaching into people's private lives.\n\nIn 2007, the first gay-themed Jordanian publication My.Kali arose. A year later, \"My.Kali\" started publication online, named after openly gay model Khalid Abdel-Hadi, making major headlines, as it is the first LGBT publication to ever exist in the MENA region, with one of the only faces in the pan Arab region.\n\nIn an article for \"Al Jazeera English\" titled 'Pushing for Sexual Equality in Jordan' stated: \"Earlier this year, they published the magazine’s 50th issue, and celebrated the magazine’s seven-year anniversary. Kali is on the cover, hugging a sculpture head, his naked torso covered in white dust. The headline reads: “Tell Me Little White Secrets!”\" the article was soon removed by the official site, and pasted on blogs and pages instead, due to the huge stir the article caused at the time. \"... an AJ foreign journalist wrote a favourable article two years ago on Jordan's only LGBTI magazine My.Kali Magazine but a day later the article was removed from its website and the journalist severely reprimanded.\" Journalist Dan Littauer writes on his official Facebook page, regarding Qatar's attempts of hushing local medias, and freedom of the press.\nThe magazine regularly features non-LGBT artists on their covers to promote acceptance among other communities and was the first publication to give many underground and regional artists their first covers like Yasmine Hamdan, both lead singer and violinist of band Mashrou' Leila, Hamed Sinno and Haig Papazian, Alaa Wardi, Zahed Sultan and many more. \"Jordan is a very traditional country, and we're considered controversial in Jordan for simply breaking the stereotype and stepping out of norm,\" Khalid told \"Egypt Independent\".\n\nEvents were held in the Jordanian capital Amman on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia in 2014 and 2015, mainly for educational purposes and for the purpose of raising voice for the community and discussing challenges. Many activists and members of the LGBT community and LGBT allies in Jordan attended the events. in the second event held in 2015 American ambassador in Jordan Alice Wells was one of the speakers. the event held in 2015 was published in almost all local media outlets.\n\nAccording to the 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center, 97% of people answers no, 3% answered yes, on question: \"Should Society Accept Homosexuality?\".\n\n"}

{"id": "826604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=826604", "title": "Public inquiry", "text": "Public inquiry\n\nA tribunal of inquiry is an official review of events or actions ordered by a government body. In many common law countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and Canada, such a public inquiry differs from a Royal Commission in that a public inquiry accepts evidence and conducts its hearings in a more public forum and focuses on a more specific occurrence. Interested members of the public and organisations may not only make (written) evidential submissions as is the case with most inquiries, but also listen to oral evidence given by other parties.\n\nTypical events for a public inquiry are those that cause multiple deaths, such as public transport crashes or mass murders. In addition, in the UK, the Planning Inspectorate, an agency of the Department for Communities and Local Government, routinely holds public inquiries into a range of major and lesser land use developments, including highways and other transport proposals.\n\nAdvocacy groups and opposition political parties are likely to ask for public inquiries for all manner of issues. The government of the day typically only accedes to a fraction of these requests. The political decision whether to appoint a public inquiry into an event was found to be dependent on several factors. The first is the extent of media coverage of the event; those that receive more media interest are more likely to be inquired. Second, since the appointment of a public inquiry is typically made by government ministers, events that involve allegations of blame on the part of the relevant minister are less likely to be investigated by a public inquiry. Third, a public inquiry generally takes longer to report and costs more on account of its public nature. Thus, when a government refuses a public inquiry on some topic, it is usually on at least one of these grounds.\n\nThe conclusions of the inquiry are delivered in the form of a written report, given first to the government, and soon after published to the public. The report will generally make recommendations to improve the quality of government or management of public organisations in the future. Recent studies have shown that the reports of public inquiries are not effective in changing public opinion regarding the event in question. Moreover, public inquiry reports appear to enjoy public trust only when they are critical of the government, and tend to lose credibility when they find no fault on the part of the government.\n\nIn France, any major project which requires the compulsory acquisition of private property must, before being approved, be the subject of a public inquiry (usually by the prefect of the region or department in which the project will take place); the favourable outcome of such an inquiry is a \"déclaration d'utilité publique\", a formal finding that the project will produce public benefit. This procedure was established by the law on expropriation enacted on the 7th July 1833, which extended an earlier law enacted in 1810.\n\nIn Britain, there are two types of public inquiry, the statutory inquiry set out in terms of the Inquiries Act 2005 (or its predecessor), or the non-statutory inquiry, often used in the investigate controversial events of national concern, the advantage being that they are more flexible, not needing to follow the requirements of the Inquiries Act.\n\nA statutory inquiry is usually chaired by a well-known and well-respected member of the upper echelons of British society, such as a judge, lord, professor or senior civil servant. Inquiries are often informally named after the chair of the inquiry, or the event that is the subject of the inquiry.\n\nIn June 2017 an online petition was started calling for the Grenfell Tower fire to be investigated by an inquest, rather than a public inquiry.\n\n\n"}

He is named for utopian socialist Robert Owen.\n\nMenaker was identified by Arlington Hall cryptographers in sixteen Venona messages. Menaker assisted Floyd Miller's infiltration of the Socialist Workers Party. Several Venona messages are related to Menaker's employer, Michael Burd, for whom Menaker worked at the Midland Export Corporation of New York City. In 1944 and 1945, Menaker traveled to Chile to represent Midland Export. While in Chile he met the Chilean diplomat Christian Casanova Subercaseaux. Burd and Subercaseaux were also both Soviet intelligence agents.\n\nAfter returning from his 1944 Chile trip, Burd complained to the New York KGB office that Menaker alienated several companies they did business with. KGB Officer Pavel Ivanovich Fedosimov reported to Moscow that \"allowances should be made\" working with Menaker since he had not been thoroughly trained or screened prior to assignment.\n\nIn a later Venona transcript, the KGB speculates about the possibility that Laurence Duggan, another source who had recently resigned from the U.S. State Department, might go to Chile in place of Menaker or do some unspecified work with him. A cable from October references work with Joseph Katz, owner of the Tempus Import Company in Manhattan, and one of the KGB's most active agents.

The English word \"taboo\" derives from this later meaning and dates from Captain James Cook's visit to Tonga in 1777. \n\nThe concept exists in many societies, including traditional Fijian, Māori, Samoan, Kiribati, Rapanui, Tahitian, Hawaiian, and Tongan cultures, in most cases using a recognisably similar word, though the Rotuman term for this concept is \"ha'a\".\n\nIn Māori and Tongan tradition, something that is tapu is considered inviolable or sacrosanct. Things or places which are tapu must be left alone, and may not be approached or interfered with. In some cases, they should not even be spoken of. \n\nIn Māori society the concept was often used by \"tohunga\" (priests) to protect resources from over-exploitation, by declaring a fishery or other resource as tapu (see rāhui).\n\nThere are two kinds of tapu, the private (relating to individuals) and the public tapu (relating to communities). A person, object, or place that is tapu, may not be touched by human contact, in some cases, not even approached. A person, object, or place could be made sacred by tapu for a certain time.\n\nIn pre-contact society, tapu was one of the strongest forces in Māori life. A violation of tapu could have dire consequences, including the death of the offender through sickness or at the hands of someone affected by the offence. In earlier times food cooked for a person of high rank was tapu, and could not be eaten by an inferior. A chief's house was tapu, and even the chief could not eat food in the interior of his house. Not only were the houses of people of high rank perceived to be tapu, but also their possessions including their clothing. Burial grounds and places of death were always tapu, and these areas were often surrounded by a protective fence. \n\nIn at least one case, a chief declared a whole settlement - Auckland, a newly founded European settler town - as tapu, to clarify to other tribes that he considered it as under his protection.\n\nToday, tapu is still observed in matters relating to sickness, death, and burial:\n\nTapu is also still observed at the site of whale strandings. Whales are regarded as spiritual treasures as being descendants of the ocean god, Tangaroa, and are as such held in very high respect. Sites of whale strandings and any whale carcasses from strandings are treated as sacred ground.\n\n\"Noa\", on the other hand, lifts the \"tapu\" from the person or the object. \"Noa\" is similar to a blessing. Tapu and noa remain part of Māori culture today, although persons today are not subject to the same tapu as that of previous times. A new house today, for example, may have a \"noa\" ceremony to remove the \"tapu\", in order to make the home safe before the family moves in.\n\n"}

It was originally called the after the date that it was founded, but soon changed its name to The Feminists. Ti-Grace Atkinson was the group's central figure and informal leader until she left the group in 1971; other prominent members included Anne Koedt (who left in 1969 to co-found New York Radical Feminists), Sheila Michaels, Barbara Mehrhof, Pamela Kearon, and Sheila Cronan.\n\nThe Feminists' best-known action may have been in September 1969, when members picketed the New York City Marriage License Bureau, distributing pamphlets protesting the marriage contract:\n\"All the discriminatory practices against women are patterned and rationalized by this slavery-like practice. We can't destroy the inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage.\"\nAccording to Germaine Greer in \"The Female Eunuch\" (1970), The Feminists promoted not having leaders in society, \"characterized men as the enemy,\" described \"Love\" as \"the response of the victim to the rapist\", and believed that \"the proprietary relationship of marriage\" and uterine pregnancy would \"no longer prevail.\"\n\nThe Feminists held that women were oppressed by their internalization of patriarchal sex roles, and hence suffered from a kind of false consciousness. To liberate themselves from such oppressive roles, The Feminists held that the feminist movement must be entirely autonomous from men and eventually came to hold that women should be free of men in their personal lives as well. The group was strongly opposed to the sexual revolution, holding that it was simply a way for men to get easier access to women's bodies. Ti-Grace Atkinson was one of the first radical feminists to be specifically critical of pornography.\n\nThey at first advocated that women practice celibacy, and later came to advocate political lesbianism. The separatist ideas of The Feminists were reflected in their membership quota, restricting women who lived with men to one-third of its members, and excluding married women entirely in 1971. After Atkinson's departure, The Feminists moved in the direction of advocating matriarchy and developing a \"woman's religion\", ideas that later came to be known as cultural feminism.\n\nAlthough The Feminists disbanded in 1973, they played an important role in the development of cultural feminism, separatist feminism, and anti-pornography feminism (Barbara Mehrhof later became an organizer for Women Against Pornography), tendencies that were predominant in radical feminism by the late 1970s.\n\n"}

{"id": "44307783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44307783", "title": "Tuhao", "text": "Tuhao\n\nTuhao () is a Chinese term referring to people of wealth. The term has several related and differing definitions throughout time. In its original literary form, it refers to those of prominent and wealthy backgrounds. In modern use, the term has also became a popular slang used to describe the \"nouveau riche\". Pejoratively, the internet slang can be understood to carry on the meaning of \"uncouth nouveau riche\", \"tacky\" or \"extravagant\".\n\nThe term 'tuhao' was originally used in ancient China, dating back to the Northern and Southern Dynasties around 1,500 years ago. The term originally referred to those of prominent origin, especially people of influential and wealthy backgrounds. During the Republic period and the Cultural Revolution from 1920 to early 1950, it was used to describe and refer to landlords or landholders who bullied those beneath them in the social class, known as the countrymen.\n\nBefore August 2013, 'Tuhao' was a popular internet slang used to describe irrational and over-consumed online game players, who were also called \"RMB warriors\" as they use renminbi to purchase in-game items and suppress regular players who did not have the ability to purchase as many items. They won by their purchasing power, rather than their online game techniques or tactics. Its usage has now extended to daily life. People who purchase a large amount of figures, models and luxury goods are also given the nickname 'Tuhao'.\n\nThe word 'Tuhao' has gone viral recently since its first appearance as a joke on the Chinese social platform Weibo in 2013: A young man asks a Buddhist monk, 'I'm wealthy, but unhappy. What should I do?' The Buddhist monk says, \"Define 'wealthy.' \" The young man answers, 'I have millions in the bank and three apartments in central Beijing. Is that wealthy?' The Buddhist monk silently holds out a hand. The young man says: 'Master, are you telling me that I should be thankful and give back?' Instead of telling him to live a simple and happy life, the Buddhist monk replied 'Tuhao, let's be friends!\" The joke implies that the tuhao's wealth was so substantial that it even made a Buddhist monk greedy.\n\nThe word \"tuhao\" comprises two Chinese characters: one meaning \"soil or earth\"; the other meaning \"grandeur\" .\n\n\"Tuhao jin\" is a word derived from \"tuhao\", literally meaning \"tuhao gold\" or \"the gold of tuhao\".\n\nOn September 20, 2013, Apple Inc. launched a new champagne gold iPhone 5s. The official price for the golden version of the iPhone 5s was 5,288 yuan (USD 862). But in China, the price of a golden iPhone 5s was above 8,800 yuan (USD 1,435). It had become a must-have item for many Chinese and soon sold out in China, prompting huge reactions on the Chinese internet. The media nicknamed the iPhone's gold color as \"tuhao jin\", denoting the lavish, garish and excessive tastes of China's emerging extravagant \"tuhaos\".\n\nThe phrase, \"tuhao jin\" was then widely used to make sarcastic remarks at gold-plated luxury cars, the opulent interior of a Chongqing school to, most recently, the golden exterior of the People's Daily office tower, currently under construction in Beijing. On the Chinese social network Weibo, one user mocked the building's golden exterior, exclaiming, \"Wow! What a massive 'tuhao jin'...\"\n\nThe fact is that Chinese has always had derogatory terms for the rich and unsophisticated. \"Tu\" (the same tu from tuhao) was one. Tuhao is significant not because it is another such term, but because it is a parody of such terms, and the discourse of crass, status-driven consumption which underlies these. \"Tuhao\" indicates fusions of rustic roots with material ambition and gaudy expressions. However, in taking this to the \"nth\" degree, the term also evinces a new capacity for Chinese to laugh at themselves. Cultural Sociologist Michael Griffiths tells us that, \"for consumers in China's higher-tier cities (who have already been around this kind of crass materialism for a couple of decades now), tuhao represents a tongue-in cheek satire of China's breakneck pursuit of material affluence in the get-rich-quick era. It also heralds a future where face-driven materialism will be less obviously paramount in consumption.\" Related trends can be seen all over China's consumer economy today, not least in changes to the luxury sector.\n\nOxford English Dictionary is considering adding \"Tuhao\" into its 2014 edition since this word has become familiar among the international society. Foreign media used \"Tuhao\" to describe Chinese tourists. In 2013, 70 percent of European luxury goods were purchased by Chinese people, and many paid with cash. Moreover, the BBC has launched a programme depicting the phenomenon of \"Tuhao\", introducing the origin, meaning and popularity. In 2015, it was also listed as one of the top \"hot words\" in China Daily and is now widely used to make fun of the rich who love luxurious products. As a result, some people are worried about the negative reputation brought by the word \"Tuhao\" to China.\n\nIn 2014, South Korean drama, 'Hotel King', made an ironic depiction of a rich Chinese man in one of its episodes, triggering a huge controversy among Chinese netizens.\n\nHowever, some argued that since the internet slang meaning behind \"Tuhao\" was meant to be tongue-in-cheek and humorous, it actually shows that the Chinese people have a sense of humor about themselves. Thus, it is claimed that the spread of the word \"Tuhao\" shows the open-minded and lighthearted side of the Chinese people.\n"}

Tushetian Guda cheese (Not to be confused with European Gouda cheese, with which it shares neither the features nor the making technique) and high quality wool was famous and was exported to Europe and Russia. Even today sheep and cattle breeding is the leading branch of the economy of highland Tusheti. The local shepherds spend the summer months in the highland areas of Tusheti but live in the lowland villages of Zemo Alvani and Kvemo Alvani in wintertime. Their customs and traditions are similar to those of other eastern Georgian mountaineers, such as the Khevsurs and Pshavs.\n\nLike most Georgian groups, they are mainly Georgian Orthodox Christian in religion.\n\nThe origin of the Tush themselves is a mysterious and debatable matter, with numerous theories regarding the origin of Tsova-Tush and of the Chagma-Tush. It also is uncertain whether the two groups have a common origin or not.\n\nTheories regarding the origin of the Tsova-Tush include involving descent from South Caucasian Nakh in Ancient times (either a Nakh people inhabiting areas of Kakheti and Tusheti), North Caucasian Nakh in the 16th century, or Old Georgian tribes who were influenced or intermixed with Nakh.\n\nAnthropological studies on the Tsova-Tush found them to be somewhere in between the Chechen-origin Kists and the Chagma-Tush of the region, but significantly closer to the Chagma-Tush.\n\nTheories regarding the origin of the Chagma Tush all include descent from Georgian tribes (possibly pagans fleeing Christianization in the 4th century CE), but variously involve influence or admixture from South Caucasian Nakh, Dagestani peoples, or none.\n\nThe region of Tusheti was first mentioned by its name in the 4th century BCE.\n\nThe lands of the Tush have variously been under the rule of Caucasian Iberia, the medieval united kingdom of Georgia, the Kingdom of Kakheti (which eventually fell under heavy influence from Persia), the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and then independent united Georgia.\n\n\n"}

This practice is widespread in the United States.\n\nCorporate giving programs created to encourage volunteerism by a corporation's employees by providing volunteer grants are called \"volunteer grant programs\" or \"Dollars for Doers\" programs.\n\nTwo main types of corporate volunteer grants are:\n\n1. Individual volunteer grants – These are small grants of around $250–$750 which are given to nonprofits to recognize an employee's volunteer commitment upon reaching a certain number of volunteer hours in a year (usually 10–50 hours). For example, the Sara Lee company will donate $10 to a nonprofit per every hour volunteered by an employee (minimum 20 hours, max 50 hours). Per employee, there is usually a minimum number of hours, a maximum number of grants and a cap on the total amount that can be awarded.\n\n2. Team volunteer grants - These are grants of around $500–$1000 which are given to nonprofits to recognize a group of employees who collectively volunteer with an organization. For example, when a minimum of Five Kohls associates from one location volunteer for three consecutive hours, the nonprofit earns a $500 grant.\n\nLess common corporate volunteer grants include:\n\n1. Annual awards for a company's top volunteer(s) - These can range anywhere from $1,000-$10,000 and are designed to recognize employees who go above and beyond the traditional volunteer expectations. \n2. Corporate grants for employees to take time off from work while receiving their full benefit package to volunteer full-time with nonprofit for a certain period of time.\n\nPhilanthropic organizations offer grants for individuals to volunteer with nonprofit organizations for an extended period of time. These are sometimes called volunteer grants but are normally referred to as fellowships. In these cases, a volunteer receives a stipend from a nonprofit to live and work within a community in need.\n\nCompanies typically state that any 501(c)(3) nonprofit or school is eligible for their corporate volunteer grant scheme; most however require a minimum number of hours served.\n\nRequesting volunteer grants is normally the volunteer's responsibility. The process varies by company program, but frequently consists of four main components:\n\n1. Log hours - Normally this time logging is done through an online system on the company's intranet.\n2. Submission - Upon reaching the required threshold for volunteer hours, the employee completes the volunteer grant request. This normally consists of completing an online or paper form that includes specific information about the nonprofit (ex. name, contact information, nonprofit tax ID, etc.)\n3. Notification - The corporation notifies the nonprofit they're the recipient of a volunteer grant pending approval.\n4. Validation - The nonprofit completes the process by submitting verification that they're still a qualified 501(c)(3) organization and the employee is actually a volunteer with the organization.\n\nIn 2010, corporations donated $15 billion to nonprofit organizations, which represents a 22% increase over 2008 corporate giving levels. Approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies offer volunteer grant programs\n\nMany corporations contract out their volunteer grant program administration. The JK Group, CyberGrants, and Volunteer Match are three of the largest vendors for contracting out corporate matching gift and volunteer grant programs.\n\nIn the US, a taxpayer cannot deduct the value of time spent on volunteer work from taxes, not even when they do so for a qualified organization. Conversely, a volunteer grant program affords a benefit to the non-profit organization and thereby a non-monetary incentive for the volunteer. The tax situation can differ between countries and is one of the factors that influence the presence or absence of volunteer grants in a country.\n\nIn the UK, an employer who lets an employee work for charity for a given amount of time can claim tax relief with regard to the wages paid for this time span.\n\nIn Germany, the volunteers may receive a tax benefit for donating time (\"\"): in certain conditions, a small monetary amount (\"\") per hour spent in volunteer work can be deducted from the volunteer's overall taxable income. On the other hand, some companies invest in a form of in which employees participate in specified volunteering activities, for example a \"day of caring\", on company-paid time.\n\n"}

These laws have the titles: \"Trespassing to Collect Data\" (SF12) and \"Trespassing to collect data- civil cause of action\" (SF 80). State Republican Marti Halverson said: \"When a person trespasses to collect resource data, that person is not only trespassing - he is stealing data that is the property of the landowner.\" It might well create a unique new category of crime called \"data trespass\".\n\nThe issues surrounding this and its history are discussed in the second episode of \"The Crowd and the Cloud\". \"The Crowd and the Cloud\" is a four-part series broadcast during April 2017, which examines citizen science.\n\nThe Idaho-based environmental group Western Watersheds Project (WWP) and its volunteers routinely check rivers for contamination from cow manure. Environmental groups such as WWP are concerned about the bacteria E. coli in streams - typically caused by cow manure.\n\nProperty owners say they need protection from trespassing snoops hunting for information - about pollution, perhaps - that could be used to harass them and harm their businesses. Wyoming ranchers and lawmakers allege the WWP has trespassed on private land to collect water quality data to support an agenda of curtailing public lands grazing.\n\nStarting from June 2014, 15 Wyoming ranchers sued Jonathan Ratner and the WWP for allegedly trespassing on private land to access Bureau of Land Management parcels to collect water samples. The ranchers allege that the group submitted water samples to the state that show Ratner has been trespassing. Many of the claims in the lawsuit are derived from plotting the locations of Ratner's samples on a map and trying to deduce how he would have got there. Ratner and Western Watersheds deny every allegation in the ranchers' complaint. In most, they contend, there is an easement on the road that grants the public access to cross private property.\n\nIn December 2014, WWP moved to dismiss the above lawsuit that has been filed against it by five Fremont and Sublette county ranch interests. The defendants claim the ranchers: \"Have utterly failed to substantiate their claims and the case should be dismissed.\" The motion also asked the court to dismiss the case because the ranchers' misconduct in violating water quality standards is connected to the matter in litigation, and their motives for bringing the lawsuit against WWP are improper.\n\nIn May 2015, WWP tried to persuade a judge to dismiss the property owners' lawsuit against it. A hearing on the motion was held on the in Fremont County District Court in Lander, presided over by Judge Norman E. Young (JNY). \nThe case awaited a ruling from JNY which was expected in the following weeks. \n\nOn Friday January 22, 2016 in Lander, JNY heard various legal motions in the case Frank Ranches V. Jonathan Ratner (as above). JNY stated: \"I think when we comb through the facts of the case we'll find that Ratner probably trespassed, but when I come to damages... It'll be nominal and that that won't support punitive damages\". JNY also stated: \"It seems to me that what the plaintiffs really, truly want and what they are truly right to say, is that they don't want Mr. Ratner on their property. That's something that can be accomplished a lot more easily than what we're about to embark upon here.\" JNY also said that he would rule on the motions in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Courthouse News Service writes that the state of Wyoming criminalized the collection of \"data\" on private and public land, without the consent of the landowner, as a response to the actions of environmentalists.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economics Analysis, give statistics for 2014 showing that out of a total GDP for Wyoming of 43,800 million dollars, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting contributed 710 million dollars, or approximately 1.6%.\n\n'Trespassing to unlawfully collect resource data; unlawful collection of resource data' became effective on the fifth of March 2015. A first offense is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000. A second offense is punishable by no less than 10 days in jail and up to a year, and a fine of $5,000.\n\nIn September 2015, plaintiffs Western Watersheds, National Press Photographers Association (NPPA), Natural Resources Defense Council Inc. (NRDC), People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Inc. (PETA), and the Center for Food Safety challenged the state of Wyoming for its data trespassing laws passed in the 2015 session.\n\nOn the 11th of December 2015, The State of Wyoming defended the Data Trespass Laws in a case to dismiss the September 2015 suit, as above. United States District Court Judge Scott Skavdahl (JSS) presided. Among JSS's queries was the expansiveness of the state's \"open land\" application to the laws. JSS asked why the term \"open land\" is spelled out in the law rather than private land. \"There must be some intent behind the legislature's distinction\".\n\nJSS also asked whether a person could be prosecuted for collecting data on Bureau of Land Management property without first gaining permission. JSS also queried whether a person could be prosecuted if he or she took a picture of private land from Interstate 25.\n\nOn the 28th of December 2015, JSS issued an order rejecting the state of Wyoming’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit. JSS' findings included that Wyoming's \"data trespass\" laws may unconstitutionally criminalize activities such as photography on public lands. \"At this stage, the Court finds it difficult to conceive a permissible rationale for preventing the collection of resource data on lands which the public has the right to be upon,\" JSSwrote, in the 38-page order about Case 2:15-cv-00169-SWS. \"Nothing indicates this activity is more disruptive, destructive, or problematic than other uses.\"\n\nJSS also wrote: \"Having the right to access the land is not enough to remove the threat of criminal and civil liability under the trespass statutes. The trespass statutes prevent activity on lands even where the public would not be trespassing.\"\n\n\n\n"}
