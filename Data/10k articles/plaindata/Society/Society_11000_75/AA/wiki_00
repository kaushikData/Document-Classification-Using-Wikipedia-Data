He belonged to the Qasimid family, descended from the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, which dominated the Zaidi imamate in 1597–1962.\n\nAli bin Abbas was one of about 20 sons of Imam al-Mahdi Abbas (d. 1775). During the reign of his father he was governor of San'a. He led a number of successful military expeditions against warring tribes. After his father's death he successfully claimed the imamate, taking the name al-Mansur Ali. His first twenty years in power were marked by periodical petty wars with unruly tribesmen. In particular a Sayyid called Ibn Ishaq (d. 1805) raised the standard of rebellion and claimed the imamate from 1781 to 1785, assisted by Arhab tribesmen. Al-Mansur Ali I managed to deal with these crises.\n\nEvents in other parts of Arabia led to severe losses for the Zaidi state after 1800. The religious Wahhabi movement expanded rapidly in the Hijaz. The semi-independent ruler of Abu Arish in the Tihamah, Sharif Hamud (d. 1818), was attacked in 1803 by the pro-Wahhabi chief of Upper Asir, Abu Nuqta. Defeated in battle, Sharif Hamud submitted to the Wahhabis. As a vassall of the latter, he committed himself to break off relations with al-Mansur Ali I. During the next three years he conquered the Tihamah from the imam, while Abu Nuqta performed raids into the territory still loyal to the Zaidi state. Al-Mansur Ali I prepared an expedition to Tihamah in 1806, but it never got underway; the event indicates the weakness of the Zaidi imamate at this time. Sharif Hamud, however, fell out with the Wahhabi regime in 1808, and in the next year he killed Abu Nuqta in an assault.\n\nThe character of al-Mansur Ali I is debated among the chroniclers. The well-known religious scholar Muhammad ash-Shawkani, who was his grand qadi, wrote favourably of him, while other texts assert that he left governance to his ministers and kept busy with building activities and womanizing. On the other hand, he was considered brave, generous and hospitable. By the early 19th century his faculties began to fail, and intrigues arose at court while chaos reigned in the land. The wazir Hasan al-Ulufi who kept the real powers in San'a was arrested by the old imam's son Ahmad, who took over the administration in 1808. He managed to appease the dissatisfied tribesmen who had performed raids around San'a. When al-Mansur Ali I died in the next year, his son became ruler in name, as al-Mutawakkil Ahmad.\n\n"}

The name was later changed to the Underground Publishing Conference, and in 2002 was formally incorporated as an organization and renamed as the Allied Media Conference. In 2006, Clamor Magazine ceased publication and a five-person collective moved the conference and the organization to Detroit, where it continues to be based. The first Allied Media Conference to be held in Detroit was in 2007. Many of the participants and staff of Allied Media, including its director Jeanette Lee, came to Detroit originally as part of Detroit Summer.\n\nThe move to Detroit led to more young people, queer people, people of color and low-income communities participating in the conference. In 2016, 65% of participants identified as a person of color, 50% as LGBTQ, and 26% as under 25 years old.. \n\nThe 20th anniversary conference in 2018 featured #MeToo founder Tyrana Burke as keynote speaker, moderated in discussion by Miriame Kaba. \n\nIn 2018, after it's 20th year, the conference leadership decided to take a one year hiatus, dubbed a \"Chrysalis Year.\"\n\nAllied Media Conference The FemTechNet Collective, a group of feminist scholars focused on critical study of science and technology, has held network gatherings in conjunction with the Allied Media Conference, amplifying the reach of this group.

For instance, the Geological Society termed the year 1945 as \"The Great Acceleration\".\n\nAn early concept for the Anthropocene was the Noosphere by Vladimir Vernadsky, who in 1938 wrote of \"scientific thought as a geological force.\" Scientists in the Soviet Union appear to have used the term \"anthropocene\" as early as the 1960s to refer to the Quaternary, the most recent geological period. Ecologist Eugene F. Stoermer subsequently used \"anthropocene\" with a different sense in the 1980s and the term was widely popularized in 2000 by atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen, who regards the influence of human behavior on Earth's atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new geological epoch.\n\nIn 2008, the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London considered a proposal to make the Anthropocene a formal unit of geological epoch divisions. A majority of the commission decided the proposal had merit and should be examined further. Independent working groups of scientists from various geological societies have begun to determine whether the Anthropocene will be formally accepted into the Geological Time Scale.\n\nThe term \"anthropocene\" is informally used in scientific contexts. The Geological Society of America entitled its 2011 annual meeting: \"Archean to Anthropocene: The past is the key to the future\". The new epoch has no agreed start-date, but one proposal, based on atmospheric evidence, is to fix the start with the Industrial Revolution \"ca.\" 1780, with the invention of the steam engine. Other scientists link the new term to earlier events, such as the rise of agriculture and the Neolithic Revolution (around 12,000 years BP). Evidence of relative human impact – such as the growing human influence on land use, ecosystems, biodiversity, and species extinction – is substantial; scientists think that human impact has significantly changed (or halted) the growth of biodiversity. Those arguing for earlier dates posit that the proposed Anthropocene may have begun as early as 14,000 to 15,000 years before present, based on geologic evidence; this has led other scientists to suggest that \"the onset of the Anthropocene should be extended back many thousand years\"; this would be closely synchronous with the current term, Holocene.\nIn January 2015, 26 of the 38 members of the International Anthropocene Working Group published a paper suggesting the Trinity test on 16 July 1945 as the starting point of the proposed new epoch. However, a significant minority supports one of several alternative dates. A March 2015 report suggested either 1610 or 1964 as the beginning of Anthropocene. Other scholars point to the diachronous character of the physical strata of the Anthropocene, arguing that onset and impact are spread out over time, not reducible to a single instant or date of start.\n\nA January 2016 report on the climatic, biological, and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores suggested the era since the mid-20th century should be recognised as a distinct geological epoch from the Holocene.\n\nThe Anthropocene Working Group met in Oslo in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the Anthropocene as a true geologic epoch. Evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend \"Anthropocene\" as the new geological age in August 2016. Should the International Commission on Stratigraphy approve the recommendation, the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the International Union of Geological Sciences before its formal adoption as part of the geologic time scale.\n\nThe name \"Anthropocene\" is a combination of \"anthropo-\" from \"anthropos\" () meaning \"human\" and \"-cene\" from \"kainos\" () meaning \"new\" or \"recent.\"\n\nAs early as 1873, the Italian geologist Antonio Stoppani acknowledged the increasing power and effect of humanity on the Earth's systems and referred to an 'anthropozoic era'.\n\nAlthough the biologist Eugene Stoermer is often credited with coining the term \"anthropocene\", it was in informal use in the mid-1970s. Paul Crutzen is credited with independently re-inventing and popularizing it. Stoermer wrote, \"I began using the term 'anthropocene' in the 1980's, but never formalized it until Paul contacted me.\" Crutzen has explained, \"I was at a conference where someone said something about the Holocene. I suddenly thought this was wrong. The world has changed too much. So I said: 'No, we are in the Anthropocene.' I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked. But it seems to have stuck.\" In 2008, Zalasiewicz suggested in \"GSA Today\" that an anthropocene epoch is now appropriate.\n\nHomogenocene (from old Greek: homo-, \"same\" geno-, \"kind\", kainos-, \"new\" and -cene, \"period\") is a more specific term used to define our current geological epoch, in which biodiversity is diminishing and biogeography and ecosystems around the globe seem more and more similar to one another mainly due to invasive species that have been introduced around the globe either on purpose (crops, livestock) or inadvertently.\n\nThe term Homogenocene was first used by Michael Samways in his editorial article in the \"Journal of Insect Conservation\" from 1999 titled \"Translocating fauna to foreign lands: here comes the Homogenocene.\"\n\nThe term was used again by John L. Curnutt in the year 2000 in \"Ecology\", in a short list titled \"A Guide to the Homogenocene\", which reviewed \"Alien species in North America and Hawaii: impacts on natural ecosystems\" by George Cox. Charles C. Mann, in his acclaimed book \"\", gives a bird's eye view of the mechanisms and ongoing implications of the homogenocene.\n\nThe human impact on biodiversity forms one of the primary attributes of the Anthropocene. Humankind has entered what is sometimes called the Earth's sixth major extinction. Most experts agree that human activities have accelerated the rate of species extinction. The exact rate remains controversial – perhaps 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction. A 2010 study found that \"marine phytoplankton – the vast range of tiny algae species accounting for roughly half of Earth's total photosynthetic biomass – had declined substantially in the world's oceans over the past century. From 1950 alone, algal biomass decreased by around 40%, probably in response to ocean warming – and that the decline had gathered pace in recent years.\" Some authors have postulated that without human impacts the biodiversity of the planet would continue to grow at an exponential rate.\n\nIncreases in global rates of extinction have been elevated above background rates since at least 1500, and appear to have accelerated in the 19th century and further since. A \"New York Times\" op-ed on 13 July 2012 by ecologist Roger Bradbury predicted the end of biodiversity for the oceans, labelling coral reefs doomed: \"Coral reefs will be the first, but certainly not the last, major ecosystem to succumb to the Anthropocene.\" This op-ed quickly generated much discussion among conservationists; The Nature Conservancy rebutted Bradbury on its website, defending its position of protecting coral reefs despite continued human impacts causing reef declines.\n\nIn a pair of studies published in 2015, extrapolation from observed extinction of Hawaiian snails led to the conclusion that \"the biodiversity crisis is real\", and that 7% of all species on Earth may have disappeared already. Human predation was noted as being unique in the history of life on Earth as being a globally distributed 'superpredator', with predation of the adults of other apex predators and with widespread impacts on food webs worldwide. A study published in May 2017 in \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\" posited that a \"biological annihilation\" akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes, such as human overpopulation, continued population growth and overconsumption, particularly by the wealthy. The study suggested that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once lived on Earth were already extinct, threatening the basis for human existence too. A different study published in \"PNAS\" in May 2018 says that since the dawn of human civilization, 83% of wild mammals have disappeared. Today livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%).\n\nPermanent changes in the distribution of organisms from human influence will become identifiable in the geologic record. Researchers have documented the movement of many species into regions formerly too cold for them, often at rates faster than initially expected. This has occurred in part as a result of changing climate, but also in response to farming and fishing, and to the accidental introduction of non-native species to new areas through global travel. The ecosystem of the entire Black Sea may have changed during the last 2000 years as a result of nutrient and silica input from eroding deforested lands along the Danube River.\n\nOne geological symptom resulting from human activity is increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO) content. During the glacial–interglacial cycles of the past million years, natural processes have varied CO by approximately 100 ppm (from 180 ppm to 280 ppm). , anthropogenic net emissions of CO increased atmospheric concentration by a comparable amount from 280 ppm (Holocene or pre-industrial \"equilibrium\") to approximately 400 ppm, with 2015–16 monthly monitoring data of CO displaying a rising trend above 400 ppm. This signal in the Earth's climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster, and to a greater extent, than previous, similar changes. Most of this increase is due to the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, although smaller fractions are the result of cement production and land-use changes (e.g. deforestation).\n\nChanges in drainage patterns traceable to human activity will persist over geologic time in large parts of the continents where the geologic regime is erosional. This includes the paths of roads and highways defined by their grading and drainage control. Direct changes to the form of the Earth's surface by human activities (e.g., quarrying, landscaping) also record human impacts.\n\nIt has been suggested the deposition of calthemite formations are one example of a natural process which has not previously occurred prior to the human modification of the Earth's surface, and therefore represents a unique process of the Anthropocene. Calthemite is a secondary deposit, derived from concrete, lime, mortar or other calcareous material \"outside the cave environment\". Calthemites grow on or under, man-made structures (including mines and tunnels) and mimic the shapes and forms of cave speleothems, such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone \"etc.\"\n\nHuman activities like deforestation and road construction are believed to have elevated average total sediment fluxes across the Earth's surface. However, construction of dams on many rivers around the world means the rates of sediment deposition in any given place do not always appear to increase in the Anthropocene. For instance, many river deltas around the world are actually currently starved of sediment by such dams, and are subsiding and failing to keep up with sea level rise, rather than growing.\n\nIncreases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas. Such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as \"technofossils.\"\n\nChanges in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions. An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the red junglefowl \"Gallus gallus\", native to south-east Asia but has since become the world's most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites.\n\nIn terms of trace elements, there are distinct signatures left by modern societies. For example, in the Upper Fremont Glacier in Wyoming, there is a layer of chlorine present in ice cores from 1960's atomic weapon testing programs, as well as a layer of mercury associated with coal plants in the 1980s. From 1945 to 1951, nuclear fallout is found locally around atomic device test sites, whereas from 1952 to 1980, tests of thermonuclear devices have left a clear, global signal of excess , , and other artificial radionuclides. The highest global concentration of radionuclides was in 1965, one of the dates which has been proposed as a possible benchmark for the start of the formally defined Anthropocene.\n\nHuman burning of fossil fuels has also left distinctly elevated concentrations of black carbon, inorganic ash, and spherical carbonaceous particles in recent sediments across the world. Concentrations of these components increases markedly and almost simultaneously around the world beginning around 1950.\n\nThe Anthropocene Working Group voted on the \"Base/beginning of the Anthropocene\", and most members favored some time around 1950. This time period has also been referred to as the Great Acceleration.\n\nWhile much of the environmental change occurring on Earth is suspected to be a direct consequence of the Industrial Revolution, William Ruddiman has argued that the proposed Anthropocene began approximately 8,000 years ago with the development of farming and sedentary cultures. At this point, humans were dispersed across all of the continents (except Antarctica), and the Neolithic Revolution was ongoing. During this period, humans developed agriculture and animal husbandry to supplement or replace hunter-gatherer subsistence. Such innovations were followed by a wave of extinctions, beginning with large mammals and land birds. This wave was driven by both the direct activity of humans (e.g. hunting) and the indirect consequences of land-use change for agriculture.\n\nFrom the past to present, some authors consider the Anthropocene and the Holocene to be the same or coeval geologic time span, others that the onset of the Anthropocene was just a bit more recent. Ruddiman claims that the Anthropocene, as defined by significant human impact on greenhouse gas emissions, began not in the industrial era, but 8,000 years ago, as ancient farmers cleared forests to grow crops. Ruddiman's work has, in turn, been challenged on the grounds that comparison with an earlier interglaciation (\"Stage 11\", approximately 400,000 years ago) suggests that 16,000 more years must elapse before the current Holocene interglaciation comes to an end, and that thus the early anthropogenic hypothesis is invalid. Ruddiman argues in rebuttal that this results from an invalid alignment of recent insolation maxima with insolation minima from the past, among other irregularities, which invalidate the criticism. Furthermore, the argument that \"something\" is needed to explain the differences in the Holocene is challenged by more recent research showing that all interglacials differ.\n\nAlthough 8,000 years ago the planet sustained a few million people and was still fundamentally pristine, this is the basis for an assertion that an early date for the proposed Anthropocene term does account for a substantial human footprint on Earth.\n\nA plausible starting point of the Anthropocene could be at \"ca.\" 2,000 years ago, which roughly coincides with the start of the final phase of Holocene, the Subatlantic.\n\nAt this time, the Roman Empire encompassed large portions of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. In China the classical dynasties were flowering. The Middle kingdoms of India had already the largest economy of the ancient and medieval world. The Napata/Meroitic kingdom extended over the current Sudan and Ethiopia. The Olmecs controlled central Mexico and Guatemala, and the pre-Incan Chavín people managed areas of northern Peru. Although often apart from each other and intermixed with buffering ecosystems, the areas directly impacted by these civilizations and others were large. Additionally, some activities, such as mining, implied much more widespread perturbation of natural conditions. Over the last 11,500 years or so humans have spread around Earth, increased in number, and profoundly altered the material world. They have taken advantage of global environmental conditions not of their own making.The end of the last glacial period – when as much as 30% of Earth's surface was ice-bound – led to a warmer world with more water (). Although humans existed in the previous Pleistocene epoch, it is only in the recent Holocene period that they have flourished. Today there are more humans alive than at any previous point in Earth's history.\n\nCrutzen proposed the Industrial Revolution as the start of Anthropocene. Lovelock proposes that the Anthropocene began with the first application of the Newcomen atmospheric engine in 1712. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change takes the pre-industrial era (chosen as the year 1750) as the baseline related to changes in long-lived, well mixed greenhouse gases. Although it is apparent that the Industrial Revolution ushered in an unprecedented global human impact on the planet, much of Earth's landscape already had been profoundly modified by human activities. The human impact on Earth has grown progressively, with few substantial slowdowns.\n\nA marker that accounts for a substantial global impact of humans on the total environment, comparable in scale to those associated with significant perturbations of the geological past, is needed in place of minor changes in atmosphere composition.\n\nA useful candidate for this purpose is the pedosphere, which can retain information of its climatic and geochemical history with features lasting for centuries or millennia. Human activity is now firmly established as the sixth factor of soil formation. It affects pedogenesis either directly, by, for example, land levelling, trenching and embankment building for various purposes, organic matter enrichment from additions of manure or other waste, organic matter impoverishment due to continued cultivation, compaction from overgrazing or, indirectly, by drift of eroded materials or pollutants. Anthropogenic soils are those markedly affected by human activities, such as repeated ploughing, the addition of fertilizers, contamination, sealing, or enrichment with artefacts (in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources they are classified as Anthrosols and Technosols). They are recalcitrant repositories of artefacts and properties that testify to the dominance of the human impact, and hence appear to be reliable markers for the Anthropocene. Some anthropogenic soils may be viewed as the 'golden spikes' of geologists (Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point), which are locations where there are strata successions with clear evidences of a worldwide event, including the appearance of distinctive fossils. Drilling for fossil fuels has also created holes and tubes which are expected to be detectable for millions of years.\n\nThe concept of the Anthropocene has also been approached via humanities such as philosophy, literature and art. In the scholarly world, it has been the subject of increasing attention through special journal issues, conferences, and disciplinary reports. The Anthropocene, its attendant timescale, and ecological implications prompts questions about death and the ends of civilization, memory and archives, the scope and methods of humanistic inquiry, and emotional responses to the \"end of nature.\" It has been also criticized as an ideological construct. Some environmentalists on the political left suggest that \"Capitalocene\" is a more historically appropriate term. At the same time, others suggest that the Anthropocene is overly focused on the human species, while ignoring systematic inequalities, such as imperialism and racism, that have also shaped the world.\n\nThere are several philosophical approaches on how to handle the future of Anthropocene: Business-as-usual, mitigation, geo-engineering options.\n\n\n"}

They are traditionally, and still mainly, goatherds and shepherds. They reside in the entire Kashmir region between India and Pakistan, and in the Nuristan province of Afghanistan..\n\nThe Gurjar-Bakarwals claim a common ancestry from the ancient Gujjar tribe. \n\nMany Kashmiri Muslims including many Bakerwals and Gujjar migrated from the Valley to Punjab due to famine and policies of Hindu Dogra rulers, during the mid-18th Century. They are traditionally Sunni Muslims.\n\n'Bakarwal' is derived from the Indic language terms, \"bakara\" meaning goat or sheep, and \"wal\" meaning \"one who takes care of\". Essentially, the name \"Bakarwal\" implies \"high-altitude goatherds/shepherds\".\n\nThe Bakarwals belong to the same ethnicity as the Gujjars, and inter-marriages take place among them. Bakarwals have clans (\"gotra\") like Gujjars; however, \"bakarwal\" is also occasionally used indiscriminately to refer to any nomadic shephard group in the foothills, even those who may not belong to a Bakarwal community ( group).\nThe Gadaria-Bakarwals have divided themselves into three principal kinship groups:\n\nThe dera is the basic unit of social structure among the Gujjar-Bakarwals. They count their numbers and describe their grazing and qafila groups in terms of the number of deras.\n\nA dera usually comes into existence when a person establishes an independent household, which happens normally after his marriage. Each son, thus, establishes his own dera as he gets married. A dera usually consists of five to six members. There is a division of labour among the members of the household on the basis of sex and age.\n\nFemales perform the domestic tasks of cooking, washing, fetching of water, upbringing of children, collection of wood, and spinning and making of woolen garments. On the other hand, males perform tasks like herding of flock and cattle, repairing of tools and equipment, collection of grass, herbs, deer-musk, hunting of wild animals, ploughing and harvesting of crops.\n\nThe household is, thus, a primary economic unit. A nuclear family is the production and consumption unit. A joint family which is generally large cannot survive on the meagre pasture resource as the transhumance are on the move for about 110 to 130 days in a year.\n\nThe elders want the eligible married youngsters to shoulder the responsibility of looking after the flock of sheep and goats independently. This would ensure greater security to the herds and sharing all responsible jobs by the adult members.\n\nSeveral deras (households) constitute a lineage (dada-potra). The pastures are allotted to the lineage and not to the individuals. In a lineage, there may be about two hundred persons. Usually, a Gujjar-Bakarwal father divides his property (animal wealth) among his male children as and when they get married.\n\nThe lineage, thus, consists of several generations and includes cousins and distant relatives. They share the common pastures. The lineage unit is quite powerful administrative unit. Each lineage has a head who is responsible for the socio-economic and political activities of his group.\n\nAs sheep and goat rearing transhumants, the Bakarwal alternate with the seasons between high and low altitudes in the\nhills of the Himalayas.\nWhile traditionally goat and sheep herders, governmental restrictions, land development, population growth, and advancements in the market economy have caused some Bakarwallah to settle in one place and engaged in other forms of agriculture in addition to animal husbandry.\n\nIn 1991 in Jammu and Kashmir the Bakarwal were first recognized as an Indian Scheduled Tribe. , the Bakarwal were classified as a Scheduled Tribe under the Indian government's general reservation program of positive discrimination.\n\nThey are mentioned in the \"Afghan National Anthem\" as one of the integral tribes present in Afghanistan.\n"}

Bihari people can be separated into three main ethnic groups, Bhojpuris, Maithils and Magahis.\n\nAlso, Biharis can be found throughout North India, West Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra, and in the neighbouring countries of Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh. During the Partition of India in 1947, many Bihari Muslims migrated to East Bengal (later East Pakistan and subsequently Bangladesh). Bihari people are also well represented in the Muhajir people of Pakistan (formerly West Pakistan) because of Partition, as well as the recent relocation of some Bihari refugees from Bangladesh to Pakistan.\n\nBihar is one of the longest inhabited places in the world with a history going back to the Neolithic age. Since that time, Biharis have long been involved in some of the most important events in South Asian history. Biharis were the founders of many great empires based out of Magadh including the Maurya Empire and the Gupta Empire. Both of these empires had their capitals in Pataliputra (modern-day Patna).\n\nTwo of India's major religions also have their origins in Bihar. Gautama Buddha who was the founder of Buddhism, achieved enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, Bihar. Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, was born in Vaishali in North Bihar.\n\nThe traditional dress of Bihari people includes the dhoti-mirjai (a modified form of the flowing jama) or the kurta (replacing the older outfit of the dhoti and chapkan which is a robe fastened on the right) for men and Saree for women. In everyday life women wear saree or Kameez-Salwar. The saree is worn in \"Seedha Aanchal\" style traditionally. Nevertheless, Western shirts and trousers are becoming popular among the both rural and urban male population. And Salwar-Kameez for women in urban Bihar. Jewelery such as rings for men and bangles for women are popular. However, there are some traditional Bihari jewelries like \"Chhara\", \"Hansuli\", \"Kamarbandh\", etc.\n\n Hindi is the official languages of the State. Maithili (61 million speakers including Bajjika dialect which has 11 million speakers in India), and Urdu are other recognised languages of the state. Unrecognised languages of the state are Bhojpuri (60 million), Angika (30 million) and Magahi (20 million). Bhojpuri and Magahi are sociolinguistically a part of the Hindi Belt languages fold, thus they were not granted official status in the state.The number of speakers of the Bihari languages is difficult to count because of unreliable sources. In the urban region, most educated speakers of the language name Hindi as their language because this is what they use in formal contexts and believe it to be the appropriate response because of unawareness. The uneducated and the rural population of the region regards Hindi as the generic name for their language.\n\nDespite of the large number of speakers of Bihari languages, they have not been constitutionally recognized in India, except Maithili which is recognised under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters in Bihar. These languages was legally absorbed under the subordinate label of Hindi in the 1961 Census. Such state and national politics are creating conditions for language endangerment.\nThe first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced Urdu as the sole official language of the province. In this struggle between competing Hindi and Urdu, the potential claims of the three large mother tongues in the region – Bhojpuri, Maithili and Magahi were ignored. After independence Hindi was again given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950. Urdu became the second official language in the undivided State of Bihar on 16 August 1989. Bihar also produced several eminent Urdu writers including Sulaiman Nadvi, Manazir Ahsan Gilani, Abdul Qavi Desnavi, Paigham Afaqui, Jabir Husain, Sohail Azimabadi, Hussain Ul Haque, Dr. Shamim Hashimi, Wahab Ashrafi etc.\n\nBihar has produced a number of writers of Hindi, including Raja Radhika Raman Singh, Shiva Pujan Sahay, Divakar Prasad Vidyarthy, Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar', Ram Briksh Benipuri, Phanishwar Nath 'Renu', Gopal Singh \"Nepali\" and Baba Nagarjun. Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan, the great writer and Buddhist scholar, was born in U.P. but spent his life in the land of Lord Buddha, i.e., Bihar. Hrishikesh Sulabh and Neeraj Singh (from Ara) are the prominent writer of the new generation. They are short story writer, playwright and theatre critic. Arun Kamal and Aalok Dhanwa are the well-known poets. Different regional languages also have produced some prominent poets and authors. Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, who is among the greatest writers in Bengali, resided for some time in Bihar. Upamanyu Chatterjee also hails from Patna in Bihar. Devaki Nandan Khatri, who rose to fame at the beginning of the 20th century on account of his novels such as \"Chandrakanta\" and \"Chandrakanta Santati\", was born in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. Vidyapati Thakur is the most renowned poet of Maithili (c. 14–15th century). Satyapal Chandra has written many English bestseller novels and he is one of India's emerging young writer.\n\nBihar's major ethnic group is Indo-Aryan including Bhojpuris, Maithils and Magahis.\nBihari society follows a very rigid caste system, which influences daily life and politics.\n\nThe 2011 Census of India indicated that Scheduled Castes constituted 15.50% of Bihar's 10.4 crores population. The census identified 21 of 23 Dalit sub-castes as \"Mahadalits\". The \"Mahadalit\" community consists of the following sub-castes: Bantar, Bauri, Bhogta, Bhuiya, Chaupal, Dabgar, Dom (Dhangad), Ghasi, Halalkhor, Hari (Mehtar, Bhangi), Kanjar, Kurariar, Lalbegi, Musahar, Nat, Pan (Swasi), Rajwar, Turi, Dhobi, Chamar and Dusadh The Paswan caste was initially left out of the Mahadalit category, to the consternation of Ram Vilas Paswan.Adivasis (Scheduled Tribes) constituted around 1.3% of the Bihari population. They include the Gond, Santhal and Tharu communities. There are about 130 Extremely Backward Castes (EBCs) in Bihar.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 82.7% of Bihar's population practiced Hinduism, while 16.9% followed Islam.\n\nIn 1947, at the time of Partition, many Muslim Biharis moved to what was then East Bengal adjacent to their Bihar province in eastern India.\n\nHowever, when East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh in December 1971, the Biharis were left behind as the Pakistani army and civilians evacuated and the Bihari population in Bangladesh found themselves unwelcomed in both countries. Pakistan feared a mass influx of Biharis could destabilise a fragile and culturally mixed population, and Bangladeshis scorned the Biharis for having supported and sided with the West Pakistan during the war.\n\nWith little or no legal negotiation about offering the Biharis Pakistani citizenship or safe conduit back home to their native Bihar in India, the Biharis (called \"stranded Pakistanis\" by some Bangladeshi politicians) have remained stateless for 33 years. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has not addressed the plight of the Biharis. An estimated 600,000 Biharis live in 66 camps in 13 regions across Bangladesh, and an equal number have acquired Bangladeshi citizenship. In 1990, a small number of Biharis were allowed to immigrate to Pakistan.\n\nPakistan has reiterated that as the successor state of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), as well as having greater cultural and linguistic similarities with Bengalis, Bangladesh should accept the Biharis as full citizens. Pakistani politicians and government officials have refused to accept these nearly 300,000 stranded Pakistanis of Bihari origin due to inability to absorb such a large number of immigrants at the moment.\n\nIn May 2008, a Bangladeshi court ruled that Biharis who were either minors in 1971 or born after 1971 are Bangladeshi citizens and have the right to vote. As a result of the ruling, an estimated 150,000 of the 300,000 Biharis living in Bangladesh are eligible for Bangladeshi citizenship. Although the court ruling explicitly said that the Biharis are eligible to register to vote in the December 2008 elections, the Election Commission closed its rolls in August 2008 without enrolling them.\n\nA large number of people from present-day Bihar travelled to various parts of the world in the 19th century to serve as indentured labours on sugarcane, cocoa, rice, and rubber plantations in the Caribbean, Fiji. Mauritius, and Natal, South Africa.\n\nA majority of Indo-Mauritians are Bihari Mauritians. Most of the Mauritian Prime Ministers were Indo-Mauritians of Bihari descent.A majority of Indo-Caribbeans are of Bihari descent, while Indo-Fijians are mostly descendants of the Awadh region in Uttar Pradesh as well as Bihar.\n\nAccording to social scientist Dr. Shaibal Gupta, the beating of students from Bihar in Mumbai in October 2008, has consolidated Bihari sub-nationalism.\n\n\n"}

The technique for this is usually to tear out the rejected leaf and paste a new one to the stub left on the cognate leaf. Alternatively, a false stub (known as a \"fold\") may be added.\n\nThe cancelled leaf may be rejected on account of spelling or typing errors, a wording change or addition, or need to suppress libellous or otherwise offensive text.\n\nLeaves have been cancelled from around the dawn of printing in the mid-15th century, peaked from about 1600 to 1800, but the practice is less common today, since it is now cheaper to replace the whole sheet.\n\nIf the replacement is made before publication, the book can exist in two states (i.e. with and without the new leaf). If after sale, from a new leaf supplied by the binder to the purchaser, it is termed an \"alternative issue\".\n\nCancels are not always easy to detect, if the stub or fold they are attached to is small; however, often there will be a difference from other leaves in matters such as paper thickness, watermarks, chainlines, etc. Whether the old leaf had a signature or not, the new one usually has one added. It occasionally occurs as an error that the old leaf is not excised, or even that the wrong leaf is removed. To obviate this, the old leaf is sometimes partly slit.\n\nThe terminology, coined by R. W. Chapman in 1930, is:\n\nEnglish: \"cancel\" (pl. \"cancels\") or \"cancel leaf\" (pl. \"cancel leaves\"); Latin: \"cancellans\" (pl. \"cancellantia\"):\nThe new (or replacement, or corrected leaf.\n\nEnglish: \"cancelland\" (pl. \"cancellands\"); Latin: \"cancellandum\" (pl. \"cancellanda\"):\nThe leaf intended to be replaced, or removed, but when this has not yet been done.\nEnglish: \"cancelled leaf\" (pl. \"cancelled leaves\"); Latin: \"cancellatum\" (pl. \"cancellata\"):\nRefers to the cancellandum after it has been removed.\n\n"}

It is more common with girls rather than boys. Girls are commonly employed as domestic servants, sometimes by force. Poor children in particular are trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation. Tanzania ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991 and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in 2003. Tanzania then enacted the Law of the Child Act, 2009. To help implement that Act and provide a mechanism for the reporting of children's rights violations, a free-of-charge helpline is available throughout the country.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor reported in its \"Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor\" study that 25% of children aged 5 to 14 are working children. This percentage corresponds to around 3.1 million children. According to the report, despite the Government's moderate advancement in eliminating child labor, children in Tanzania still engage in agricultural and mining activities as indentured labourers.\nIn December 2014, an ILAB \"List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor\" reported 8 goods produced in such working conditions in Tanzania, 6 of them are agricultural goods (most importantly coffee, sisal, tea and tobacco).

{"id": "1633582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1633582", "title": "Civil penalty", "text": "Civil penalty\n\nA civil penalty or civil fine is a financial penalty imposed by a government agency as restitution for wrongdoing. The wrongdoing is typically defined by a codification of legislation, regulations, and decrees. The civil fine is not considered to be a criminal punishment, because it is primarily sought in order to compensate the state for harm done to it, rather than to punish the wrongful conduct. As such, a civil penalty, in itself, will not carry jail time or other legal penalties. For example, if a person were to dump toxic waste in a state park, the state would have the same right to seek to recover the cost of cleaning up the mess as would a private landowner, and to bring the complaint to a court of law, if necessary.\n\nCivil penalties occupy a strange place in some legal systems - because they are not criminal penalties, the state need not meet a burden of proof that is \"balance of probabilities\"; but because the action is brought by the government, and some civil penalties can run into the millions of dollars, it would be uncomfortable to subject citizens to them by a burden of proof that is merely a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" Therefore, the assessment of most civil penalties requires a finding of \"clear and convincing evidence\" before a civil defendant will be held liable. A defendant may well raise excuses, justifications, affirmative defenses, and procedural defenses. An administrative law judge or hearing officer may oversee the proceedings and render a judgment. Judgment is made on the balance of probabilities, meaning if it is more than fifty percent likely that the accused is responsible then the accused shall be found guilty.\n\nIn some cases, a civil penalty may be supplemented by other legal process, including administrative sanctions or even criminal charges, and their respective appeals. For example, failure to pay a fine assessed for a traffic code violation may result in administrative suspension of a driver's license, and further driving after suspension may be a criminal offense. On the other hand, a minimal case may be \"put on file\", or otherwise suspended for a period during which the defendant may be required to avoid further violations, or carry out specific duties (such as making repairs or restitution, or attending supplemental education), after which the matter is dismissed.\n\nIn other cases, such as public safety and consumer protection violations, the local authorities may revoke permits and licenses, and seek injunction to stop or remove non-conforming works or goods, in addition to the civil penalty.\n\nPending or admitted civil violations may also be used as evidence of responsibility in a civil suit. One example is speeding causing in a car accident, resulting in a wrongful death claim. However, the plaintiff may be required to prove causation through a harm encompassed in the regulations.\n\nThe concept of civil penalties in English is in a state of flux. In contract, damages is a remedy to provide monetary compensation for loss; and damages may be unliquidated (general damages), or liquidated (pre-determined). In the absence of an out-of court settlement, unliquidated damages must be ascertained by a court or tribunal, whereas liquidated damages will be determined by reference to the contract or to a mutually agreed arbitrator. The purpose of liquidated damages is to provide certainty and to avoid both the bother and cost of legal proceedings. \n\nIt is well established that liquidated damages for breach of contract are void if they seek to punish rather than to compensate for loss. For a contractual \"penalty\" clause to be valid, one must show that it was drawn up after a bona fide attempt to estimate loss in advance of the breach. For example, a motorway construction contract may have an estimated finish date with a \"penalty clause\" for every day late; but provided that this date is realistic and the \"penalty\" is a reasonable approximation of loss, the clause will be valid. The validity of the clause will be advanced if there is an equivalent bonus for finishing early.\n\nDifficulties can arise with fines for wrongful parking (parking in the wrong area, or overstaying). There are three scenarios: (i) parking on public streets; & parking in a private car park either (ii) with permission, or (iii) without permission. If a parking fine is imposed for type (i), since the powers exercised by the local authority have been delegated by Parliament, there is little that one can do, except to seek judicial review and allege disproportionality. If it is type (ii), such as in a supermarket car-park, then contract rules apply. If, say, the cost was £1 for an hour, and you got a £60 ticket for overstaying a further hour, you can legally send them an extra £1, plus (say) £5 as a contribution to their administration expenses. If they are not satisfied, they would have to issue a county court summons, which might not be cost effective.\n\nIn type (iii) where one has parked on private land without permission, a typical notice might read: \"In parking on this land, you hereby accept that your vehicle will be clamped and a £100 release charged\". Although this may seem a simple matter of trespass with an unavoidable fine, it may amount to a case of implied contract (i.e. \"if you park here, you agree to pay a penalty\"); and such a \"penalty\" (read \"damages\") must be proportionate or else the fine will be void. Also, since the penalty notice could have been attached to the windscreen, the clamping of the vehicle may itself be unlawful trespass. It should be noted that since the introduction of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 (also known as POFA), that wheel clamping is illegal unless by an Authority (e.g. Police, Local Authority or DVLA).\n\n"}

Since the late-2000s, Flint has consistently ranked among the most violent cities in the United States. Law enforcement in Flint is primarily the responsibility of the Flint Police Department, which is often assisted by the Genesee County Sheriff's Department and the Michigan State Police, which maintains a post in adjacent Flint Township that serves all of Genesee County, as well as the Genesee County Parks and Recreation Commission and the campus police departments of the University of Michigan–Flint, Kettering University, and Mott Community College.\n\nThe Flint Police Department (a.k.a. Flint PD or FPD) is the primary law enforcement agency in the city, led by Chief Tim Johnson. In recent decades, it has faced significant downsizing due to population decline and the ongoing economic depression in the city.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2010, mayor Dayne Walling reduced the number of patrol-level police officers from 208 to 67. The total number of police officer positions fell by 141, due to a combination of layoffs, resignations, and retirements\n\nOn September 28, 2011, the Flint Police Department was awarded $1,225,638 from the Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program to re-hire 6 laid off patrol officers. The officers were scheduled to be on the job starting in October 2011.\n\nOn June 18, 2012, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder visited Flint and announced additional state troopers would be sent to Flint and that additional state money would be provided to Flint for the city jail. Additionally, on the same day, state representative Jim Ananich proposed the Michigan State Housing Development Authority give state money from the federal foreclosure benefit fund to the Flint Police Department to hire more officers. A month later on July 17, 2012, Ananich reiterated his push to secure those funds from the state. He also pointed out that scrap metal thefts are on the rise in the city, and proposed a portion of the $97 million fund be set aside to prevent them, which he claimed will also benefit the local economy by attracting new businesses to the city.\n\nFlint PD's newest squad is the Crime Area Target Team, formed by Chief Tim Johnson in April 2016. It concentrates on combating the illegal narcotics trafficking and firearms trades. In February 2017, it confiscated $20,000 street value crystal methamphetamine, $20,000 street value heroin, nearly $10,000 worth of powder cocaine, $2,300 worth of crack cocaine, $30,000 worth of marijuana, $1,500 in psilocybin mushrooms, $1,500 of illegal prescription medications, and about $34,000 cash. This resulted in 126 arrests, 238 new felonies, 82 new misdemeanors, 22 felony warrants, 19 misdemeanors, 30 guns confiscated and 30 vehicles impounded.\n\nThe Flint Police Department was featured in a 2015 episode of TNT's \"\", which paid to test old rape kits that resulted in convictions of three people for criminal sexual conduct.\n\nThe Flint Police Department has appeared in the 31st season of the reality show \"Cops\", which aired in the summer of 2018.\n\nThe Flint Police Department (and the Flint water crisis) is also the subject of the eight-part 2018 Netflix documentary \"Flint Town\", which was recorded in 2016.\n\nThe following statistics are derived from the annual Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reports.\nFlint has been consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States by multiple sources. From 2007 to 2009, violent crime in Flint was ranked in the top five among U.S. cities with a population of at least 50,000 people. From 2010 to 2012, Flint ranked as the city with the highest violent crime rate among cities with over 100,000 population. In 2015, \"CQ Press\" (using FBI statistics) ranked the crime index for Flint as 7th-highest in cities with population greater than 75,000.\n\nUnsolved crimes remained high in Flint. In 2008, only 19 of 32 homicides resulted in convictions; in 2009, only 12 of 36 homicides led to conviction; and, in 2010, only 31 of 64 homicides led to conviction.\n"}

Their ethnic identity is not known with certainty, but it is usually assumed that they were a Tungusic people, related to the Jurchens and/or the Nanais.\n\nThe name of this ethnic group is sometimes also written in English as \"Jucher\".\n\nThe total number of Duchers (including other related Manchu groups, but not the Daurs or Evenks) of the Amur Valley at the time of the appearance of the Russian explorers in the region ca. 1650 has been estimated by modern scholars at 14,000.\n\nAccording to the Russian explorers of the time, the Duchers, as well as the related groups, the Goguls, and their north-western neighbors, the Daurs, were agriculturalists. They grew rye, wheat, barley, millet, oats, peas, and hemp, as well as a number of vegetables. The Duchers had horses and cattle; pigs were a particularly important source of meat. They did some hunting and fishing as well.\n\nAccording to the 17th-century Cossacks' reports, the Duchers lived in fortified villages () with 60 and more houses in each.\n\nThe predecessor of the Qing fortress Aigun (which was originally located on the left - now Russian - bank of the Amur, opposite to its later location) was a Ducher town, currently known to the archaeologists as the Grodekovo site (Гродековское городище), after the nearby village of Grodekovo. It is located south of the city of Blagoveshchensk and the fall of the Zeya into the Amur. Yerofey Khabarov reported the existence of this town (which he called Aytyun (Айтюн)) to the Yakutsk voivode D. Frantsbekov in 1652. According to the archaeologists, this fortress was first built around the end of the first or beginning of the second millennium CE.\n\nThe \"tribute\" of furs, grain, and livestock, collected (or looted, as the case may be) by the Cossacks from the Daurs and the Duchers was the main economic benefit derived by the Russians from their expansion in the region in the early 1650s, and, in order to deny it to them, the Qing government starting in 1654 resettled the Ducher farmers from the Amur valley to the Sungari and Hurka Rivers further south. The Daurs were resettled (to the Nenjiang River Valley) as well. When Onufriy Stepanov visited the lower Sungari in 1656, he found the Ducher villages deserted.\n\nThe ethnic identification of the Duchers and even the meaning of their name (and whether it was also a self-name) remain controversial. \n\nArchaeologically, the Ducher culture can be identified since the second half of the 13th century (i.e., soon after the destruction of the Jurchen Jin Empire by the Mongols), being a successor of the earlier culture of the Amur Jurchens.\n\nAccording to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, today's Nanai, Ulch, and other Tungusic people of the middle and lower Amur valley have incorporated descendants of the Duchers. The Russian scholar B.P. Polevoy goes even further, identifying the Duchers (at least, the ones from the Sungari / Ussury mouth area) with the Nanais. \nAnother, and probably more common, view, expressed e.g. by the Russian archaeologist D.P. Bolotin or Tungusologist A.A. Burykin is that the Duchers were part of the Jurchens. This would imply that after being resettled to the Sungari and the Hurka they simply merged into the Manchu people. \n\nThe etymology of the word \"Duchers\" (which, besides дючеры and дучеры, had a number of other spelling variants in the 17th-century Russian manuscripts: чючар, джучар, жучер, дючан) is controversial as well. Some researches hold it obvious that it is related to Jurchens' self-name, \"jušen\". Another view, expressed by A.A. Burykin, is that Russian \"дючер\" (\"Dyucher\") may have come from Manchu \"zuche\", \"zuchen\", meaning \"guards along the river\".\n"}

A diaspora can also be found in Armenia, Estonia as well as in Kazakhstan and other states of Central Asia. Erzya is currently written using Cyrillic with no modifications to the variant used by the Russian language. In Mordovia, Erzya is co-official with Moksha and Russian.\n\nThe language belongs to the Mordvinic branch of the Uralic languages. Erzya is a language that is closely related to Moksha but has distinct phonetics, morphology and vocabulary.\n\nMinimal pairs between and include:\n\nAs in many other Uralic languages, Erzya has vowel harmony. Most roots contain either front vowels (, ) or back vowels (, ). In addition, all suffixes with mid vowels have two forms: the form to be used is determined by the final syllable of the stem. The low vowel (), found in the comparative case -шка (\"ška\") \"the size of\" and the prolative -ка/-га/-ва (\"ka\"/\"ga\"/\"va\") \"spatial multipoint used with verbs of motion as well as position\" is a back vowel and not subject to vowel harmony.\n\nThe rules of vowel harmony are as follows:\n\n\nHowever, if the back vowel is followed by a palatalized consonant or palatal glide, vowel harmony is violated and the \"front\" form of the suffix is used: кальсэ (\"kaĺse\") \"with willow\", ойсэ (\"ojse\") \"with butter\". Likewise, if a front-vowel stem is followed by a low back vowel suffix, subsequent syllables will contain back harmony: велеванзо (\"veĺevanzo\") \"throughout its villages\"\n\nThus the seeming violations of vowel harmony attested in stems, e.g. узере (\"uźere\") \"axe\", суре (\"suŕe\") \"thread (string)\", are actually due to the palatalized consonants and .\n\nOne exception to front-vowel harmony is observed in palatalized non-final , e.g. асфальтсо (\"asfaĺtso\") \"with asphalt\".\n\nThe modern Erzya alphabet is the same as for Russian:\n\nThe pre-1929 version of the Erzya alphabet included the additional letter Cyrillic ligature En Ge (Ҥ ҥ) in some publications, (cf.

The activities are coordinated by the European Association for the Preservation and Promotion of Jewish Culture (AEPJ), the European Council of Jewish Communities, B'nai B'rith Europe and the Network of Jewish Quarters in Spain. The aim of this day is to promote and raise awareness of Jewish culture to the wider society in the countries where this event takes place, in the belief that a greater awareness of the culture, tradition and life of the different communities living in the same country or city helps people to know the \"other\", and thus, strengthens communication and dialogue between cultures in the country.\n\nThe annual event was initiated in 1996 by the B'nai Brith of Strasbourg in the French département Bas-Rhin together with the local Agency for development of tourism. It now involves twenty-seven European countries including Turkey and Ukraine. The original aim of the day was to permit access to, and ultimately restore, long abandoned synagogues of architectural value like those of Wolfisheim, Westhoffen, Pfaffenhoffen, Struth, Diemeringen, Ingwiller or Mackenheim.\nIn 2000, a partnership was created between B'nai B'rith and the other organizations that currently participate in organizing the day's events.\n\nOn this day exhibitions, concerts, panel discussions, lectures and excursions are organized in many European countries.

It is led by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR).\n\nThe inaugural GLF event took place alongside to 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 19) in Warsaw, Poland. It heralded the merger of Forest Day and Agriculture and Rural Development Day, reflecting a scientific climate that favored breaking down research silos and utilizing an integrated landscape approach. The first four major GLF events were held annually on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Change Conference.\n\nFollowing a major funding injection from the German government, the GLF moved to establish a secretariat in Bonn, Germany. This is part of an effort on the part of the German government and the city of Bonn to establish a \"sustainability cluster\" in the city.\n\nCIFOR serves as the implementing organization of the GLF, and the current coordinating partners are the World Bank, and the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\nAs of 2017, the host country partners are the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) and Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).\n\nFollowing a move towards more integrated landscape approaches in both the forestry and agriculture sides of the research for development sphere, the Global Landscapes Forum was born out of a merger of Forest Day and Agriculture and Rural Development Day (ARDD), both of which were formerly long-standing side events at the United Nations Climate Change conference (COP).\n\nForest Day was an annual COP side event co-organized by CIFOR and the Collaborative Partnership on Forests, since the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP13) in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nAs of 2012, by resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 28, 2012, Forest Day became the International Day of Forests.

It was held by many petty authorities, including many lords of the manor, who sat in justice over the serfs, unfree tenants, and freeholders on their land. \nMiddle justice would involve full civil and criminal jurisdiction, except for capital crimes, and notably excluding the right to pass the death penalty, torture and severe corporal punishment, which was reserved to authorities holding high justice, or the \"ius gladii\" (\"right of the sword\").\n\nAlthough the terms \"high\" and \"low\" suggest a strict subordination, this was not quite the case; a case could often be brought in any of several courts, with the principle of \"prevention\" (in the etymological sense of Latin \"praevenire\", \"to come before\") granting jurisdiction to the court in which the case was first filed or otherwise brought.\n\nAs a rule, each court administered justice in general (criminal cases were generally not separate from civil actions and other types of justice, while certain matters were separated such as canon law), as long as the matter was not reserved for a higher court or by virtue of some \"privilegium fori\" (e.g., of clerics to be judged in canon courts by other clergy, sometimes under ecclesiastical law, the origin of the English common-law concept—benefit of clergy). In addition to civil and criminal trials, the notion of justice also included \"voluntary justice\", which is really the official recording of deeds (unilateral or bilateral) such as marital agreements, wills, grants, etc.\n\nA right of appeal was not automatically available, only when explicitly established, and if so not always to a court of the superior political level and/or a higher degree of our trio. In fact, feudal justice was a labyrinth of specific customs and rules in nearly endless variation, not governed by any clear legal logic, and subject to significant historical evolution in time, though the largely customary law tended by nature to be quite conservative. In judicial matters—as in all spheres of life—feudal society did not see uniformity as either possible or necessarily desirable, each town and region having its own customs and ways of doing things, and resented attempts to interfere with them.\n\nWhile the right of justice is held by many \"unique\" courts, relatively strong states make it a pillar of their absolutist (re)emergence to establish numerous courts to administer justice in their name in different territorial circumscriptions, such as the royal (high) sheriffs in England, and/or to impose an appeal (at least unifying the law as such) to a royal court, as to the various French provincial parlements.\n\nHigh justice, also known as \"ius gladii\" (\"right of the sword\") or in German as \"Blutgerichtsbarkeit\", \"Blutgericht\" (lit. \"blood justice\", \"blood-court\"; sometimes also \"Halsgericht\", lit. \"neck-justice\", or \"peinliches Gericht\") is the highest penal authority, including capital punishment, as held by a sovereign—the sword of justice and hand of justice are regalia that symbolize it. In the early Holy Roman Empire, high justice was reserved to the king. From the 13th century, it was transferred to the king's vassals along with their fiefs.\nThe first codification of capital punishment was the \"Halsgerichtsordnung\" passed by Maximilian I in 1499, followed in 1507 by the \"Constitutio Criminalis Bambergensis\". Both codes formed the basis of the \"Constitutio Criminalis Carolina\" (CCC), passed in 1532 under Charles V. In the Habsburg Monarchy, all regional codes were superseded by the \"Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana\" in 1768.\n\nThe \"Blutbanner\" (\"blood banner\") or \"Blutfahne\" (\"blood flag\") was a solid red flag. It was presented to feudal lords as a symbol of their power of high jurisdiction (\"Blutgerichtsbarkeit\") together with the heraldic banner of the fief. Some feudal houses adopted a red field symbolic of the blood banner into their coat of arms, the so-called \"Regalienfeld\".\nThe Talschaft (forest canton) of Schwyz used the blood banner as a war flag from ca. 1240, and was later incorporated into the flag of Schwyz and the flag of Switzerland.\n\nOften it is proudly displayed, in the form of relevant status symbols. Thus permanent gallows are often erected in prominent public places; the very word for them in French, \"potence\", is derived from the Latin \"potentia\" meaning \"power\".\n\nHigh justice is held by all states and the highest vassals in the European type of feudal society, but may also be acquired by other authorities as part of a high degree of legal autonomy, such as certain cities; which in time often obtained other high privileges originally reserved for high nobility and sometimes high clergy. Other such privileges could include a seat in a diet or a similar feudal representative assembly, before the third estate as such even aspired to such \"parliamentary\" representation, or the right to mint coins. These privileges indicating its so-called \"liberty\" was an \"equal\" enclave in the territorial jurisdiction of the neighboring feudal (temporal or ecclesiastical) Lord, sometimes even extending rather like a \"polis\" in Antiquity.\n\nNot every Vogt held high justice. Up to the 18th century, for example, the blood court of much of what is now the canton of Zürich lay with Kyburg, even in the territory ruled by the counts of Greifensee. The self-administration of the blood court was an important factor of Imperial immediacy.\n\n\n"}

After Haiti was taken over and colonized by the French in 1633, many Dutch Jews (whom many were Marrano) emigrated from Brazil in 1634 and became employees of the French sugar plantations and further developed the trade. In 1683, the Jews were expelled from Haiti and all of the other French colonies, due to the Code Noir \"(Black Code)\", which not only restricted the activities of free Negroes, but forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism (it included a provision that all slaves must be baptized and instructed in the Roman Catholic religion), and in turn ordered all the Jews out of France's colonies. However, despite the Black Code, a limited number of Jews remained in French trading companies as leading officials, including foreign citizens (Dutch, Danish, or English) or holders of special residence permits \"(lettres patentes)\". These Jews specialized in agricultural plantations. Portuguese Jews from Bordeaux and Bayonne settled mainly in the southern part of Haiti (Jacmel, Jérémie, Léogâne, Les Cayes, Petit-Goâve, and Port-au-Prince) and Jews from Curaçao settled in the northern part (Cap-Haitien, and Saint Louis).\nHowever, in the mid-1700s, many Jews returned to Haiti and were later murdered or expelled during the slave revolt led by Toussaint Louverture in 1804, as many Jews also arrived from civil strife in Poland (with the invading Russia, Prussia and Austria).\n\nDue to a lack of Sunday school and Jewish community centers, many youth did not grow up with a Jewish education and had to hide their Judaism because only Catholics were permitted to attend public school. Many Jews preferred to settle on the coastline, in port cities as many Jews were involved in commerce and trade establishing communities in major industry centers. Recently, archaeologists have uncovered an ancient synagogue of Crypto-Jews in the city of Jérémie, the only one found on the island. Several Jewish tombstones have also been found in port cities such as Cap-Haïtien and Jacmel. Approximately 30 Jewish families by the end of the 19th century have arrived from Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt. A law in France was passed during this period that gave French citizenship to minorities in the Americas; thus many Jews from the Middle East felt secure emigrating to Haiti. These Jews in particular, brought with them their many Sephardic customs and traditions.\n\nIn 1915, during the United States occupation of Haiti, roughly 200 Jews lived in Haiti at the time. During the 20 years period of occupation, many Jews left Haiti for the United States and South America. In 1937, Haiti was responsible for saving about 70 Jewish families (an estimated total of up to 300 lives) during the Holocaust (according to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee), by issuing passports and visas to Jews escaping Nazi persecution. Some were Austrian Jews, Polish Jews, German Jews, and a trickle of Romanian Jew and Czech Jewish descent. While these numbers are not as high as the number of Jewish families that Oskar Schindler helped save, a life is a life as Haiti played a small, yet critical role in saving Jewish lives during the darkest chapter in the Jewish story Unfortunately, though, it seems that more Jews were unable to acquire visas to Haiti due to the cost. Professor David Bankier, of the Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that after 1938, \"“the cost [of a visa] was outrageous: If you wanted to go to Haiti, you had to pay $5,000.”\" Haiti at the time, was still unfairly paying reparations on an exorbitant debt with interest fees to France after the Haitian Revolution that could have hindered their efforts to continue issuing these visas for free. There were others apart from this bunch who never came to Haiti at all, but from Germany they were given Haitian passports by the Haitian government that allowed them to flee Germany and into other countries. Grateful to the Haitian government, many of these European Jews stayed in Haiti until the late 1950s in which many Haitian Jews left, so that their children could marry other Jews and not assimilate, while finding better economic opportunities. The 1957 Jewish population of Haiti was about 200. The mid-20th century was a time where a continued departure of Jews from Haiti for the United States and Panama because of the economic conditions and civil violence in the country.\n\nToday, the Jewish community is led by Rabbi Douglas Lapin, a local businessman. The Jewish community is known as the \"Consistoire d'Haiti\" and has been recognized as the representative of the Jewish community by the Haitian Ministry of Religion (Ministere des Cultes) <Rep. d'Haiti; Ministere des Cultes DG/909 6 fevrier 2017>. Rabbi Lapin has likewise been recognized as the Rabbi in Haiti by the Haitian government<Tribunal de Premiere Instance de Port au Prince; Recipisse No. 3710084007-7; 4 Octobre 2017>. The community is very small and mostly consists of UN, NGO, and diplomatic personnel, although there are a small number of Haitian Jewish families. The community does Kosher chicken slaughtering (shkita) and has occasional gatherings for Jewish festivals such as Succos and Purim. There is also an Esrog, Myrtle (Hadasim) and Willow (Aravos) plantation to supply local needs for Succos.\nThe community is working on developing a synagogue and community center. There is a complete library of Jewish liturgical books (seforim), Megillas Esther and Sefer Torah.\n\nThe 1960s was a time of wealth and high hopes of large future development for Haiti. At the time met many family Jewish names such as: Alvarez, Cardozo, Cohen, Dreyfus, Goldman, Hakim, Hillel, Khan, Monsanto, Pereira, Salzmann, Silveira, and Weiner, which most had forgotten their ethno-religious backgrounds. Today, less than a hundred Jews remain in Haiti on its 9.5 million inhabitants; however, the Weiners (coffee exporters) and the Salzmanns (refugees from Austria) are still today relevant in trade.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1947, after the Second World War, the islands came into the possession of Greece: as a consequence most of the Italians were forced to emigrate and all of the Italian schools were closed. However, their architectural legacy is still evident, especially in Rhodes and Leros.\n\nThe Kingdom of Italy occupied the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean sea during the Italian-Turkish war of 1911. In the 1919 Venizelos-Tittoni Agreement, Italy promised to cede the overwhelmingly Greek-inhabited islands, except Rhodes, to Greece, but this treaty was never implemented due to the Greek catastrophe in Asia Minor. With the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, the Dodecanese was formally annexed by Italy, as the \"Possedimenti Italiani dell'Egeo\".\n\nIn the 1930s, Mussolini embarked on a program of Italianization, hoping to make the island of Rhodes a modern transportation hub that would serve as a focal point for the spread of Italian culture in Greece and the Levant. The Fascist program did have some positive effects in its attempts to modernize the islands, resulting in the eradication of malaria, the construction of hospitals, aqueducts, a power plant to provide Rhodes' capital with electric lighting and the establishment of the Dodecanese Cadastre.\n\nThe main castle of the Knights of St. John was also rebuilt. The concrete-dominated architectural style blended in with the islands' picturesque scenery (and also reminded the inhabitants of Italian rule), but has consequently been largely demolished or remodeled, apart from the famous example of the Leros town of Lakki (founded by the Italians as \"Portolago\"), which remains a prime example of Italian Rationalism.\n\nFrom 1923 to 1936, governor Mario Lago was able to integrate the Greek, Turkish and Ladino Jewish communities of the island of Rhodes with the Italian colonists. Lago's term of office constituted what might in retrospective be called the \"Golden Period\" of the Italian Dodecanese, with the economy booming and a relatively harmonious society.\n\nIn the 1936 Italian census of the Dodecanese islands, the total population was 129,135, of which 7,015 were Italians. Nearly 80% of the Italian colonists lived in the island of Rhodes. Approximately 40,000 Italian soldiers and sailors were on military duty in the Dodecanese islands in 1940.\n\nThe appointment of Fascist quadrumvir Cesare Maria De Vecchi as governor of the Italian Aegean Islands in 1936 marked a turning point. De Vecchi promoted a more vigorous and forceful program of Italianization, which was only interrupted by Italy's entry in World War II in 1940.\n\nIndeed, he promoted the possible unification of the islands to Italy as part of the fascist ideal of an Imperial Italy.\n\nDuring World War II, Italy joined the Axis Powers, and used the Dodecanese as a naval staging area for its invasion of Crete in 1940. After the surrender of Italy in September 1943, the islands briefly became a battleground between the Germans, British and the Italians (the Dodecanese Campaign). The Germans prevailed, and although they were driven out of mainland Greece in 1944, the Dodecanese remained occupied until the end of the war in 1945, during which time nearly the entire Jewish population of 6,000 was deported and killed. Only 1200 of these Ladino-speaking Jews survived, thanks to their lucky escape to the nearby coast of Turkey with some help from the Italian colonists of Rhodes. In the Treaty of Paris in 1947, the islands were ceded to Greece.\n\nFor the nearly 8,000 Italian colonists, after the Italian defeat in World War II, started a process of return to Italy and successive disappearance. The Dodecanese officially passed from Italy to Greece in 1947, and in that year all the Italian schools were closed. Some of the Italian colonists remained in Rhodes and were quickly assimilated. Actually only a few dozen old colonists remain, but the influence of their legacy is evident in the relative diffusion of the Italian language mainly in Rhodes and Leros.\n\nThe citadel of Rhodes city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks in great part to the large-scale restoration work carried out by the Italian authorities. The Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes formed the centerpiece of this project, after being largely destroyed by an ammunition explosion in 1856.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Italians demolished the houses that were built in and around the city walls during the Ottoman period. They also turned the Jewish and Ottoman cemeteries into a green zone surrounding the Medieval Town. The Italians preserved what was left from the Knights' period, and destroyed all other Ottoman buildings that weren't of importance. Furthermore, in those years an \"Institute for the study of the History and Culture of the Dodecanese region\" was established, and major infrastructure work was done to modernize Rhodes. Buildings like the Aquarium were built, mainly in art deco style.\n\nIndeed, in all the Dodecanese islands remains a huge architectural legacy from the Italian colonists.

The community consists of two groups - the Palakkad Iyers and Iyers of the Cochin and Travancore regions.\n\nKerala Iyers, like the Iyers of Tamil Nadu and the Nambudiris of Kerala, belonged to the Pancha-Dravida classification of India's Brahmin community. They mostly belonged to the Vadama and Brahacharanam sub-sects. Iyers were usually not recruited as the priest (shanthi) in Kerala temples which followed Tantric rituals. Furthermore, in the past, the orthodox Nambudiri Brahmins considered the touch of a Tamil Brahmin to be taboo (Eda Shudam), and required a Nambudiri to bathe before resuming ritual activities. Such practices have now disappeared with the criminalisation of untouchability.\nSo Iyers being Vedic scholars built their own temples in their Agraharams to conduct pooja, since they followed the Agama rituals and not the Tantric rituals of the Nambudiris.\n\nWhere ever they settled, the Kerala Iyers lived together in communities. The settlement consisting of array of houses and other amenities developed by Tamil Brahmins in Kerala came to be known as Agraharam as in other parts of South India. Each Agraharam consist of two rows of houses facing each other. There is no courtyard but only common street. Several such Agraharams together form an organization called \"Samooham\". There existed 95 Agraharams in Kerala where Brahmins lived in peace, with unity, equality and simplicity. From 18th century onwards Tamil Brahmins started establishing \"Samooha Madoms\". These were common gathering places for get together, conducting religious rites and rituals, cultural events and so on. Samooha Madoms were physically located in close proximity to the temple of the main Village Deity for the convenience of all members. It is believed that as much as 250 Samooha Modoms were established by Tamil Brahmins throughout Kerala. (KBS 2012 – Editorial) This was done with the active aid and support of the rulers of the locality. These Samooha Madoms were known by various names such as Brahmana Samooham, Gramajana Samooham, Grama Samudayam and Grama Samooham. Large land endowments were instituted by wealthy community members for the unhindered progress of different activities in these Samooha Madoms.\n\nThe Palakkad Iyers were greatly affected by the Kerala Agrarian Relations Bill, 1957 (repealed in 1961 and substituted by The Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963) which abolished the tenancy system.\n\nDuring the rule of Travancore kings, many Iyers (Tamil Brahmins) were invited to Thiruvananthapuram for administrative requirements of Travancore kingdom and for participating in rituals related to Padmanabhaswamy Temple. Some Padamangalam Nairs involved in temple service are thought to be descendants of Travancore Iyers. The migration continued for decades, and thus Iyer population is concentrated around this temple in Trivandrum.\n\n\n\nThe Kerala Brahmana Sabha is the apex organization of Kerala Iyers.\n\n"}
{"id": "15977906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15977906", "title": "Light brown apple moth controversy", "text": "Light brown apple moth controversy\n\nThe light brown apple moth (\"Epiphyas postvittana\", often abbreviated to LBAM) is a leafroller moth belonging to the lepidopteran family Tortricidae. The moth was confirmed to be present in mainland United States in 2007, principally along the West Coast. The State of California and the US Department of Agriculture quickly imposed quarantine measures and decided to use aerial spraying of cities with pesticides to try to eradicate the moth. This led to substantial public controversy and claims of adverse health effects. Aerial spraying was discontinued in 2008. Trapping, monitoring, and inspection efforts were reduced or eliminated in 2012 due to budget problems.\n\nThe insect is regarded as an herbivorous generalist, and the larvae consume numerous plant crops in Australia and New Zealand. The species is native to Australia and is found in New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Hawaii.\n\nThe moth has been classified as a noxious insect in the United States and Canada, but not in Europe. This has resulted in restrictions on produce from Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nIn late 2007, the moth eradication program controversially included aerial spraying of a product containing \"E. postvittana\" attractant sex pheromones as its active ingredient over sixty square miles near the Pacific coast between Monterey and Santa Cruz. The US Environmental Protection Agency authorized the aerial spraying of the pheromone spray every 30 days until 2010. In June 2008, the State of California announced that it was abandoning plans for aerial spraying over population centers.\n\nIn 2012, the state cut funding for the pest control program.\n\nIn December 2015, a California appeals court ruled against the LBAM pesticide program on the grounds that it violated state environmental laws.\n\nThough the first light brown apple moth confirmed in California by DNA analysis was found in February 2007, scientists like James Carey, a professor of entomology at the University of California-Davis and associate editor on several journals, believes, based on his previous experience with the gypsy moth program, that the light brown apple moth has likely lived in California for years and possibly decades (in part because it is so widespread, from Los Angeles to north of San Francisco). The debate over how long the moth has been in the state has not yet been resolved. Questions about the rationale for the timing of the spray program suggest that it appears be more closely related to agricultural quarantines from Mexico and Canada than other factors.\n\nAdditionally, since the moths appear unlikely to survive in typical conditions of much of the agricultural areas of the state of California, such as in the extremely high temperatures of the Central Valley, some question the level of crop damage possible. One paper states:\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the presence of the moth in California by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the California Department of Food and Agriculture issued a State Interior Quarantine order restricting intrastate shipment of plant material from counties where LBAM had been found. APHIS later issued a Federal Domestic Quarantine order on May 2, 2007, with restrictions on interstate shipment of plant material. CDFA officials, together with the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, initiated what they described as an emergency eradication program, including domestic and international quarantines and inspection programs. Although a pesticide cannot be legally used if it has not been registered by EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs in accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the EPA has the ability to approve emergency exemptions (under Section 18 of FIFRA) for unregistered uses of pesticides for limited time periods if the EPA determines that emergency conditions exist and the request meets EPA safety requirements. The EPA granted a quarantine exemption request from the USDA which stated:\n\nOn September 24, 2007 the group 'Helping Our Peninsula's Environment' (HOPE), opponents of the spraying and concerned over the potential impacts to humans and the environment, filed suit to halt the spraying program because the California Dept of Food and Agriculture claimed it was exempt from California's Environmental Quality Act which required analysis of the environmental impacts of the use.\n\nA few weeks later in October HOPE obtained a court injunction that postponed the pheromone spraying for two weeks. The injunction was lifted a week later, the group said, because it was impossible to prove that \"inert\" ingredients cause harm when the manufacturer and the government agencies refused to disclose the names and concentrations of the ingredients.\n\nThe \"Monterey County Weekly\", in October 2007, reported that according to CDFA spokesman Jay Van Rein, the first two aerial applications over the Monterey Peninsula cost $3.7 million, with $3.1 million of that used to buy the spray products. The November 2007 application was described as costing $2.7 million.\n\nAlthough the ingredients of LBAM-F have been published on the CDFA website, the ingredients of OLR-F and the concentrations of the different components and residues from the chemical manufacturing process—necessary to determine toxicity levels during applications—remain unpublished. Many question the statements by state officials that the products used for the aerial spray, Checkmate OLR-F and Checkmate LBAM-F, are safe to be sprayed on densely populated residential areas. At an April city council meeting in the city of Alameda California, Councilmember Frank Matarresse asked CDFA Secretary Kawamura, \"If this were sprayed on an open field, would farmworkers be allowed to be in the field while you are spraying?\" Secretary Kawamura responded with \"No.\".\n\nAfter the spraying in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties in the fall of 2007, over 600 complaints of adverse health effects were reported . The California Department of Food and Agriculture received 330 reports of complaints such as eye irritation, difficulty breathing, rashes, headaches, and muscle aches, among others. A local environmental group also reported that they received more than 300 complaints.\n\nOn April 8, 2008, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) issued a report on the complaints of adverse health effects that stated that they did not have enough data to conclude whether or not a link exists between illness complaints and the 2007 pesticide spraying in Santa Cruz and Monterey. Although the press release describing the report explicitly claimed that no link was found, the report actually concluded that \"It is not possible to determine whether or not there is a link between any of the reported symptoms and the aerial spraying,\" and later stated that was because, \"more than 90 percent of the 463 symptom reports do not contain adequate information for us to determine whether or not there is a link between the reported symptoms and the spray applications.\" Earlier news stories by the \"Santa Cruz Sentinel\" and the \"San Jose Mercury News\" based on the press release, were removed and replaced with corrected news stories.\n\nIn response to the OEHHA report, on April 11, 2008, Assemblymember John Laird stated in a press release:\n\nThe CDFA argues that only very small amounts of the spray were used and so should not have resulted in adverse health effects.\n\nDr. Lawrence Rose, a former Senior Public Medical Officer for the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration for 28 years and part of the UCSF Occupational/Environmental Medicine Department, in a report titled, 'Marin Pesticide Spraying Health Hazard Alert,' described the actions of state officials as \"far beyond irresponsible, and in fact criminal negligence would be a more appropriate label for the lack of public health follow-up.\"\n\nOn April 16, a report on the dangers of the microcapsules was sent as a letter to Dr. Robert Leavitt of the environmental advisory task force, by Dr. Dennis Knepp, a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and Dr. Jeff Haferman, also an engineer, explaining that the spray was shown to include capsules with diameters less than or equal to 10 micrometers in diameter (termed PM10) which, in sufficient concentration, is a known health hazard regardless of the content of the particulates.\n\nCritics state that no published efficacy reports on the pheromone formulations used aerially against LBAM exist, raising questions about the validity of the eradication effort. Additionally, University of California scientists and other independent experts recommend containment measures in urban areas, but that full-scale airplane spraying should be saved for crop areas that agricultural departments are trying to protect in the Central Valley. Oakland city council member Jane Brunner questioned the location of the sprayings in interviews and in her resolution against the efforts, stating, \"A very curious issue for me is that they're spraying in Richmond, Berkeley and Oakland, but they are not spraying in Danville, Walnut Creek and out in the valley.\" In April 2008, Oakland City Attorney John Russo, in an article expressing his reasons for opposing the spray, said that state officials cannot describe the amount of the chemical it will take to rid the state of apple moths, nor how many years the spray will need to be conducted. He also mentioned:\n\nThe group 'Helping Our Peninsula's Environment' proposes controlling the moth with the targeted use of pheromone-baited sticky traps. These are the same traps used for population size measuring purposes. The traps have caught and killed almost all the 27,000 LBAM moths found so far in California. This method would employ four additional traps for every LBAM caught and consumes far less resources in traps and staff than applying 160,000 twist ties per square mile (250 per acre).\n\nOther critics of the aerial spray plan, such as The California Nevada Regional Conservation Committee of the Sierra Club, propose that twist ties be impregnated with the pheromone and hung on trees and other structures across the area. They say they prefer least-toxic, environmentally sensitive control methods to spraying. The California Department of Food and Agriculture has determined that more than nine million twist ties would be required to cover the infested area. Because the twist ties need to be placed at optimal distances from each other, one trained employee can correctly place 30 to 40 twist ties in a single day. Twist ties become ineffective after about three months and then need to be removed, disposed of, and replaced four times a year. As a result, using twist ties as the primary measure to control the moth has been ruled out. In early February 2008, the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that treatment using pheromone-infused twist ties was scheduled for LBAM eradication in some lightly infested areas. A USDA official has stated that they are still considering whether to treat San Francisco and the East Bay Area through ground or aerial application.\n\nIn March 2008, Fairfax, California City Councilmember Larry Bragman wrote an article stating that since no biological basis for the spraying appears to exist, the more likely issue appears to be the costly trade quarantines invoked by Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). But he also cited an excerpt from the Mexican quarantine demand:\n\nBragman, like others, notes that the moth is not a quarantine pest in Europe, and pointed to the recent research papers by Harder and Carey that he believes constitute technical and scientific information which should be conveyed to trade representatives.\n\nSeveral county public health officials posted public letters expressing their concerns or disagreements with the spray program. Health Officer of the Public Health Division of the County of Santa Cruz, Poki Stewart Namkung, stated in a letter on March 18, 2008, to Santa Cruz Assemblymember Laird, that:\n\nAnd Alameda County Public Health Director, Athony Iton, along with Alameda County Supervisor Keith Carson, stated in a letter on February 26, 2008, to the CDFA, that:\n\nOn April 9, 2008, California Congressmember Sam Farr (D-Carmel) further inquired at an agriculture hearing in Washington D.C. about how and when the light brown apple moth was blacklisted and whether it should be declassified from that status. News stories about the inquiry quoted Farr as saying:\n\nBruce Knight, Under Secretary of Agriculture for Marketing and Regulatory Programs, has said that he would respond to the inquiry and would review federal policies regarding the strategy of aerial spraying on the Central Coast.\n\nIn December 2013, a paper titled, \"Clear, Present, Significant, & Imminent Danger: Questions for the California Light Brown Apple Moth (Epiphyas postvittana) Technical Working Group,\" was published in the journal, \"American Entomologist\" that called into question the role of scientists in the decision-making that led to the aerial spray.\n\nBy June 2008, over 30 California city councils including San Francisco, Monterey, Pacific Grove, Seaside, Santa Cruz, Oakland, Albany and Berkeley had passed resolutions against the spray and over 80 environmental, health and political groups were on record opposing it. In February 2008, several legislative bills based on citizen concerns about aerial spraying in urban areas and the ability of state agencies to declare a state of emergency were drafted by state legislators. On March 13, 2008,\nAssemblyman John Laird, D-Santa Cruz, introduced Assembly Concurrent Resolution 117, calling on the Departments of Food and Agriculture and Pesticide Regulation, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and other state agencies to answer unresolved questions. He stated, \"It is the responsibility of our government to demonstrate its LBAM actions are necessary and do not compromise human or environmental health,” Laird said. “It isn’t the responsibility of the people to demonstrate the reverse.\" The resolution uses a fast track process in the state House and Senate which does not require the Governor's signature. Laird's Invasive Pest Planning Act of 2008, AB 2763, passed the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee by a vote of 4–0 on April 2 of 2008. On March 22, 2008, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom wrote a public letter to the Governor urging him to study health consequences before continuing with the spray campaign. He cited relevant state legislation and asked the governor to sign the bills into law immediately.\n\nIn order to conduct the spraying, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (not the state agency) was able to obtain an \"emergency exemption from registration\" from the U.S. EPA. Representatives of the California Department of Pesticide Regulation say that because of that exemption, the spraying program is not subject to state approval. But Santa Cruz city Attorney John Barisone has said that the moth \"isn't an emergency. We've known about it for quite a while.\" The legal brief he is involved in argues that the state first knew, in 1995, that the moth was \"highly likely\" to establish itself in the United States, but that no environmental studies were done on how best to deal the moth, resulting in the spray plan and consequent panic among residents fearful of spray effects.\nIn March 2008, an Associated Press investigation into the decision to award a $497,000 no-bid contract to Porter Novelli, a public relations firm tasked to promote the spraying program, described e-mails obtained by AP as indicating that a senior state contracting official questioned the contract award. The e-mails, obtained through a California Public Records Act request, also showed that a senior counsel with the California Department of General Services questioned the rationale for a no-bid contract, and admitted that he had never before been asked to approve a no-bid contract for public affairs work. The investigation also focused on an expected winner in the contract, naming Jeff Randle, a frequent campaign and political adviser to Arnold Schwarzenegger, as being promised by state officials to receive a share of the work. Randle was a campaign consultant involved in the scandal that drove disgraced state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush from office, and was hired as a consultant for Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial campaign in 2003. A CDFA spokesperson said that U.S. Department of Agriculture would be reimbursing the state of California for much of the cost of the $497,000 PR firm contract, but could not provide any details. One day after the Associated Press published the story behind the contract, the deal was suspended.\n\nAnother contract questioned by some has been the contract for the aerial dispersal of the pheromone, given to Dynamic Aviation, an experienced Virginia aerial application company that also has government contracts with the Defense Department and Homeland Security, among others.\n\nIn an article for \"The California Progressive Report\", the Mayor of Albany, California, Robert Lieber, RN, called for the resignation of CDFA Secretary Kawamura, citing his three main concerns: that the pheromone has not been tested for long-term human exposure risk, that the inert ingredients are toxic and carcinogenic, and that U.C. Davis scientists examining the microcapsules found that \"some particles are small enough to be inhaled into the deep lung where they cannot be expelled.\" He described the conduct of Secretary Kawamura as a \"disgraceful public deception campaign.\"\n\nOn September 24, 2007 Helping Our Peninsula's Environment (HOPE) filed the first suit alleging CDFA had violated California's Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by falsely claiming their aerial spraying program was exempt from CEQA due to an emergency. A little more than one month later the County and City of Santa Cruz filed an essentially identical lawsuit.\n\nOn April 24, 2008, Santa Cruz County won their California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) lawsuit against CDFA halting any spraying in that county until an Environmental Impapct Report (EIR) is completed. On May 8 CDFA's attorney Anita Ruud told Monterey County Judge O'Farrell the EIR is expected to be complete in January 2009. In 2008 CDFA suspended aerial spraying during the rainy season until late spring indicating that aerial spraying in Santa Cruz County should not resume until late spring 2009.\n\nIn response to Judge Burdick's question CDFA's attorney Bill Jenkins admitted that LBAM had done \"no documented damage\" to California agriculture or ecosystems. The county attorney Jason Heath cited documentation that some federal officials themselves did not consider the moth to be a serious threat, but instead described it as a \"transient pest\" and cited \"largely untested strategies.\"\n\nAt the end of the hearing the Judge ruled that CDFA had abused their discretion and violated California's Environmental Quality Act when they illegally exempted their aerial spraying program from CEQA claiming the LBAM discovery in California was an emergency. Judge Burdick did not find any evidence that the arrival of the light brown apple moth in California constitutes the claimed emergency. He ordered CDFA to halt the spraying program and rescind their exemption from CEQA until an Environmental Impapct Report is completed.\n\nJust an hour later, following a meeting with State Senator Carole Migden and Marin County officials, Governor Schwarzenegger announced that the state will postpone the spray program until some tests for acute toxicity of the sprays are completed expected on August 17, 2008.\n\nOn May 12, 2008, Monterey County Superior Court Judge Robert A. O'Farrell reached a similar conclusion in an identical Monterey CEQA case brought on September 24, 2007 by Helping Our Peninsula's Environment (HOPE).\n\nO'Farrell halted the program of aerial spraying of Monterey peninsula communities until an Environmental Impact Report is prepared. The judge ruled that CDFA had illegally exempted themselves from the California Environmental Quality Act because there was no \"substantial evidence\" of significant damage by the LBA moth.\n\nOn June 18, 2008 CDFA filed Notices of Appeal for both of the CEQA lawsuits they had lost. (The following day CDFA announced the abandonment of aerial spraying over populated areas. It is not known whether CDFA will pursue the appeals.)\n\nIn December 2013, Drs. James Carey and Daniel Harder published a paper titled, \"Clear, Present, Significant, & Imminent Danger: Questions for the California Light Brown Apple Moth (Epiphyas postvittana) Technical Working Group,\" in the journal, \"American Entomologist\". The study calls into question the role of scientists in the decision-making that led to the aerial spray.\n\nOn December 2, 2015, in a case against the CDFA by several groups, including Earth Justice, the California Environmental Health Initiative, Pesticide Action Network, and others, the Third District Court of Appeals ruled against the LBAM pesticide program on the grounds that it violated state environmental laws.\n\nOn April 16, the Assembly Agriculture Committee passed two pieces of legislation: ACR 117 and AB 2763.\n\nACR 117 is an Assembly Concurrent Resolution that calls on the California Department of Food and Agriculture, the Department of Pesticide Regulation, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and other relevant state departments to address unresolved health, scientific and efficacy issues involving the eradication plans. The resolution passed 5–3 and next goes to the Assembly Appropriations Committee.\n\nAB 2763, the Invasive Pest Planning Act of 2008 – would require the CDFA to create a list of invasive animals, plants, and insects that have a reasonable likelihood of entering California for which an eradication program might be appropriate.\n\n\n"}

But the airline has since ordered the Airbus A320-200 and A320neo.\n\nIn March 2018, it was stated that Garuda Indonesia wanted to order the CS300 as a replacement for the Bombardier CRJ-1000.\n\n\nThe carrier, in June 2015, converted 10 of the CS100 on order to CS300 frames for delivery in 2017. 5 more CS100 aircraft were converted to CS300 in June 2016. The remaining 5 CS100 were convertible to the larger variant within the end of 2016; Swiss announced with their 2016 financial results in March 2017 that they finalized the conversion.\nThe firm order signed by this undisclosed airline was terminated due to financial difficulties of the customer and removed from the backlog during the first quarter of 2013.\nThis order was originally announced as signed by an undisclosed airline, reported as a major network carrier. It was disclosed in June 2013 that the airline was Gulf Air. It was at first announced as the first operator of the CS100 aircraft, however, Gulf Air deferred their deliveries until 2018, as part of its restructuring plan. As a result, Braathens Regional Aviation was to be the first airline to receive the CS100, but declined the role due to the program's delays.\nThe contract signed by this new startup airline was originally announced as firmed by an undisclosed European airline. Media sources initially reported the customer as \"Odyssey Airlines\". Bombardier revealed the identity of this customer during the 2013 Paris Air Show (June 17–23). At the end of March 2014, Odyssey CEO revealed that the CS100 the airline has on order would be delivered during 2016.\nThe lessor was originally disclosed as an unnamed customer. On October 18, 2013, Bombardier announced that CDB Leasing was the company that signed this conditional order and contextually added 15 options to the previous deal.\nThe airline was previously identified as an undisclosed airline in the Americas.\nPorter Airlines specified that the two conditions that would have led to a firm contract would have been the approval by the Government of Canada, the city of Toronto and the Toronto Port Authority of an amendment to the Tripartite Agreement, that bans jet aircraft from operating into Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (Toronto Island) and a runway extension of on each end of the runway. The Government of Canada refused to open the agreement.\nairBaltic signed a top up firm order at the Singapore Airshow in February 2014 and initially requested to remain unidentified. According to numbers provided by Bombardier, this order consisted of converted options. On July 14, 2014, Bombardier revealed the top up order came from airBaltic.\nThis order by was included in Bombardier's Q1 2014 Financial Report but not officially announced by a Press Release until the 2014 Farnborough Airshow in July.\nThis airline, which asked to remain unidentified at the time, is an existing Bombardier customer based in Africa.\nFlightglobal reported that this top-up order came from existing customer Ilyushin Finance Co. The lessor's website also reports a total of 39 CS300 on order.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, following bankruptcy proceedings of Republic Airways Holdings, Bombardier removed Republic's order from its production plan, despite retaining it on the backlog.\nDue to the economic situation in Russia, IFC revisited its order for 32 CS300 aircraft plus 10 option to 20 CS300 aircraft plus additional Bombardier Q400 aircraft.\nOn 17 June 2015 at the Paris Airshow, airBaltic confirmed it will be the launch operator of the CS300 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The airline received its first CS300 at the end of November 2016, commencing CSeries operations on the 14th December 2016.\nIn March 2017, Braathens Regional Aviation announced it would postpone all of its orders for the CSeries indefinitely after a new Swedish ticket tax was proposed which is expected to decrease passenger demand. Upon releasing of the second quarted financial result from Bombardier, the total order from Braathens Leasing is now consisting uniquely of CS100 aircraft, signifying a conversion by the customer completed during the quarter.\nDuring the first quarter results conference, Bombardier announced that Ilyushin Finance had reassigned 6 of their CS300 on order to GTLK State Transport Leasing Co., to be leased to Red Wings Airlines and operated in cooperation with Nordavia.\nIn June 2018 several news outlets have reported that a new start-up by David Neeleman, tentatively named Moxy Airways, was to order 60 CS300 aircraft to start operations in 2020. During the 2018 Farnbourough airshow, a consortium of investors signed a commitment with Airbus, with deliveries starting in 2021, although they dismissed the usage of Moxy in the name as that would be in conflict with the samely-named Moxy Hotels by Marriott International.\n\n"}

{"id": "32170722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32170722", "title": "Nigerians in Ireland", "text": "Nigerians in Ireland\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there were 17,642 resident Nigerians in Ireland, representing a 9.67% change over the 2006 figures of 16,300 Nigerian born people resident in Ireland. They constitute the largest African group in the country.\n\nRecent Nigerian migration to Ireland began after Nigeria's independence from the United Kingdom in 1960; migration began to accelerate slightly during the late 1960s Nigerian Civil War, though it remained small. Early Nigerian migration to Ireland consisted primarily of businesspeople, especially in the fishing industry (Irish-exported mackerel is widely consumed in Nigeria). Other early migrants included medical students, who had intended to return to Nigeria after completing their courses, but ended up staying in Ireland. Migration began to become more noticeable after 1981. Medical students trained at the Royal College of Surgeons as well as Trinity College. The first significant mass-migration of Nigerians to Ireland comprised Nigerians from the United Kingdom. Most came only with the intention of extending their UK visas and then returning, but the ones who failed settled down in Ireland as illegal immigrants. After the landmark High Court case \"Fajujonu v. Minister for Justice\", which prohibited deportation of parents of Irish-born children, more Nigerians began coming to Ireland. Then, from around 1996, during Ireland's \"Celtic Tiger\" period of rapid economic expansion and labour shortages, some Nigerian workers were recruited from overseas by Irish companies, while others came to the country, seeking either opportunities for jobs, or to set up niche businesses aimed at other African migrants providing goods and services which they expected would not otherwise be available in the Irish market. Between 2002 and 2006, the population of Nigerian citizens in Ireland grew by 81.7%, according to Irish census figures, making them the country's fourth-largest migrant group at the time. Many recent migrants are asylum-seekers. However, from 2002 to 2009 the number of Nigerian applicants for asylum fell sharply, dropping from a peak of 4,050 to just 569. The sharp drop in Nigerian asylum applicants was due to the obtaining residency via parentage of Irish citizen children or marriage to Irish and EU spouses and due to the high failure rates in the granting of asylum and the granting of leave to remain. Nigerians were also in the top 3 candidates for deportation orders.\n\nThough their migration is relatively recent, Nigerian migrants mention that they had contact with Irish people and institutions in their home country, such as charitable activities run by Irish Catholic clergy or Irish non-governmental organisations, which contributed to their positive image of Irish people prior to migration. Among Nigerian respondents to a 2008 survey, 40% had no friends or family in the country at all prior to arrival, double the rate of other migrant groups such as Indians and Lithuanians, though slightly less than Chinese. 22% mentioned education and training as their motivation for migration, while 16% mentioned joining family. They are far more likely (90%) than other migrant groups surveyed to have children, whether in Ireland or elsewhere. Furthermore, about half state that they are responsible for full or partial support of other adult or minor family members. More than 80% were married, and those, for about one-fifth, their partners lived in Nigeria rather than in Ireland; more than 90% have children.\n\nPrior to 2004, liberal citizenship laws entailed that any child born in Ireland was an Irish citizen, regardless of the nationality of the parent or their link to Ireland. After the landmark High Court case \"Fajujonu v. Minister for Justice\", which prohibited deportation of parents of Irish-born children, more Nigerians began coming to Ireland, some initially seeking asylum and then giving birth shortly upon arrival. However reform was sought by the general public to the phenomenon known as \"anchor babies\" . In the Supreme Court case of \"L. and O. v. Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform\", delivered on 23 January 2003, it was held that a foreign national parent of an Irish-born child did not have an automatic entitlement to remain in the State with the child. As a result of that case the Minister reviewed his policy. The Minister decided that the separate procedures for the consideration of residency applications based solely on parentage of an Irish-born child should cease with effect from 19 February 2003. At that date a total of 11,493 applications, which had been made on this basis, were outstanding. This review became known as the IBC 05 Scheme. In addition, Irish citizenship laws were amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2004 for future cases, removing the automatic right of Irish citizenship at birth were parents of the child were non-Irish. As of January 2006, a total of 17,917 applications under the IBC 05 Scheme were received and processed. A total of 16,693 applicants were given leave to remain under the scheme and 1,119 were refused. It has been cited that Nigerian nationals made up 59% of applicants of the IBC 05 Scheme and 57% of successful applicants.\n\nA 2008 survey found that 86% of Nigerian respondents had been employed before migration to Ireland, while just 8% were full-time students. 27% had been self-employed, a much higher rate than other migrant groups surveyed. 25% had worked as managers and executives, 11% in business and commerce, 17% in local or central governments, 12% in health-related occupations, and 5% in personal services. Only 16% had a job offer in Ireland prior to arrival, about double the rate of Chinese respondents, but less than a third the rate of Indian or Lithuanian respondents. They are more likely than the other groups surveyed to find their employment through newspaper advertisements, rather than the internet or friends and family. About half of the survey respondents were employed at the time of the survey, with another 16% of men and 13% of women looking for work. Many work in personal services and childcare (positions such as care assistants, security guards, waiters, or hotel staff). This marked a significant shift from their previous pattern of employment in their home country, and has been interpreted as evidence of deskilling. About half of Nigerian men and two-thirds of Nigerian women feel that their qualifications are fully recognised in their main job. Compared to other groups they have an intermediate level of income (majority reporting between €14,401 and €31,720). Fewer than 2% are employed in predominantly Irish working environments.\n\nCompared to other migrant groups, Nigerians have been noted for their high level of involvement in electoral politics, community organisations, and anti-racism struggles. By 2008, two Nigerians had been elected to city council positions in Ireland, namely in Portlaoise (Rotimi Adebari) and Ennis. A 2008 survey found that 50% of Nigerian respondents were registered to vote, more than double the other recent migrant groups surveyed. 25% of the same survey group were again involved with trade unions, again far more than the other groups. Involvement in political and civic activity tends to be high among asylum seekers while they are awaiting the completion of the asylum process, but drops off afterwards due to increased demands on their time by employment. The same survey found that, Nigerians, in common with Chinese, often reported racism or discrimination in the workplace. They stated that they often suffered bullying from their managers as well as their co-workers. They are often stereotyped as criminals. They are also more likely than other groups surveyed to feel that Irish people are not accepting of diverse cultures and communities as part of society.\n\nThere are many Nigerian organisations in Ireland. Most are affiliated with the Houston, Texas-based Nigerian Union Diaspora (NUD), which is the umbrella Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) for the economic and political empowerment of the people of Nigerian descent outside Nigeria. Community organisations established by Nigerians within Ireland include the Nigerian Association of Ireland and the Igbo Association of Ireland. Nigerian organisations are typically ethnic-specific (as in the Bini Community in Ireland and the Igbo Progressive Union) or local-specific (as in the Association of Nigerians in Galway). There is also an umbrella organisation, the Nigerian Association Network in Ireland. Nigerians are also active in pan-African organisations and general migrant organisations. Arambe Theater Productions, a pan-African drama group, was established in 2003 by Nigerian performance artist Bisi Adigun. There is also Nigerian Carnival Ireland (NCI), an annual festival to celebrate Nigerian & other ethnic cultures in Ireland, established in 2010 by Nigerian TV personality & consummate speaker Yemi Adenuga. A Nigerian-run beauty pageant, The Most Beautiful African Girl is also in Ireland. Some Nigerian churches have been established in various places in Ireland, along with various Nigerian-owned shops and restaurants, especially in Dublin's Moore Street. The Association of Nigerian Doctors in Ireland (ANDI) was inaugurated in a dinner on 6 June 2015.\n\nNigerians have also established several magazines such as \"Bold & Beautiful\" and \"Xclusive\". Nigerian television stations are available through satellite providers such as Africa Independent Television and BEN Television.\n\nYoruba and Igbo were the most common spoken languages by the Nigerian community in Ireland. According to the Irish population and housing census of 2011, 10,093 people spoke Yoruba at home, making it the most widely spoken African language in the country, while 3,875 spoke Igbo. Other Nigerian languages were not specified.\n\nIn contrast to other migrant groups surveyed, Nigerians have a high level of English usage in almost all kinds of interactions, including with children, with other Nigerian friends, in other socialisation, and at work; only communication with partners was an exception to this trend. 95% rate themselves as having \"fluent\" or \"adequate\" command of English. However, they are strongly likely to feel that they do not have many values in common with Irish people.\n\nIn a 2008 survey, about one-third of Nigerian respondents were in education on a part-time or full-time basis, mostly at tertiary institutions. They often face high tuition fees, due to the requirement that students have been employed and paying taxes in three out of the five preceding years to qualify for reduced European Union tuition rates. The same survey found that 90% of Nigerian respondents had made use of health services in Ireland (such as GPs, hospitals, community health centres, medical cards, and private insurance providers), a much higher rate than the other groups surveyed (Chinese, Indians, and Lithuanians, ranging from 40% to 60%).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2827077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2827077", "title": "Oneida Indian Nation", "text": "Oneida Indian Nation\n\nThe Oneida Indian Nation (OIN) or Oneida Nation is a federally recognized tribe of Oneida people in the United States. The tribe is headquartered in New York, where the tribe originated and held its historic territory long before European colonialism. It is an Iroquoian-speaking people, and one of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, or \"Haudenosaunee\". Three other federally recognized Oneida tribes operate in locations where they migrated and were removed to during and after the American Revolutionary War: one in Wisconsin in the United States, and two in Ontario, Canada.\n\nToday the Oneida Indian Nation owns tribal land in Verona, Oneida, and Canastota, New York, on which it operates a number of businesses. These include a resort with a Class III gambling casino.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the OIN has been a party to land claim suits against the state of New York for treaties and purchases it made after the American Revolutionary War without ratification by the United States Senate, as required under the US Constitution. Litigation has been complex, related to trust lands, Class III gaming, property, and sales tax collection. The landmark agreement entered into on May 16, 2013 between Madison and Oneida Counties, the OIN, and the state resolved these issues.\n\nThe tribe is headquartered in Verona, New York, and the Nation Representative is Ray Halbritter. He has been the leader since 1975. In 1993, the United States government formally recognized Mr. Halbritter as the OIN leader. \n\nThe tribal council of the OIN has established the rules for citizenship: it requires documentation of at least 1/4 blood ancestry (equivalent to one grandparent) through the maternal line. The OIN and other Iroquois nations have had a matrilineal kinship system, with descent and inheritance through the mother's line.\n\nThe OIN consists of three clans: Turtle, Wolf, and Bear. Each Nation member belongs to one of these clans. A child is considered born into the mother's clan, and takes social status from her people.\n\nLegend has it that clan names and the matrilineal kinship system came from a response to issues that arose during the Haudenosaunee mourning process. Prior to clans being created, the entire Oneida village would mourn after the death of a village member. This caused problems as important decisions were put on hold during the time of mourning. Village leaders were at a loss as to how to continue everyday life while at the same time observing traditional mourning practices. A young village member approached the leaders with a possible solution. He suggested sending three female elders to the nearby river, having them build a fire, and spend the night. At first light the following morning the women were to pray to the Creator and take notice of the first animal that approached the river. Once the women had seen an animal, they were to report back to the village leaders. The elders put the young man’s plan into action. Three women were sent to the river. Upon their return one woman reported that she had seen a turtle at the edge of the river. The second woman reported seeing a wolf running along the river. The third woman stated that she had seen a bear feeding in the river along the rocks. Following the reports of the women, village leaders named the Oneida clans the Turtle, Wolf and Bear clans. They determined that a village member’s clan would be passed through the mother's line from generation to generation, as women have the Creator’s gift to create life. The Oneida Nation is still a matrilineal kinship society. After the clans were established, the people developed their practices for a mourning process. When there was a death in the village, the clan members of that person would mourn. The members of a second clan would console them, and the members of the third clan would carry on village business as usual.\nThe Haudenosaunee people are made up of several Nations. Among these nations are kinship groups called clans. While Nation members have their immediate family of parents and siblings, they also have an extended family of fellow Clan members. As a matrilineal society, each clan member is born into their clan by their mother. The three Oneida Nation clans are named after animals, the turtle, wolf, and bear. Each animal is considered to have certain positive characteristics or attributes. The turtle teaches patience, as well as the importance of never giving up. Turtles are also seen to be representative of strength and solidarity. They are thought to be old and wise, and are well respected. The wolf teaches the importance of using your ears, listening and being watchful. They embody a strong sense of family. Finally, the bear is seen as gentle and strong. Bears are seen as having strength in knowing that takes more strength not to raise your hand and strike, than to give into the impulse to strike.\n\nThe tribe set up Oneida Nation Enterprises, through which it operates a number of businesses in Central New York. As of 2013, it was the largest employer of the area, with approximately 5,000 jobs total. Business interests include:\n\nIn the early 1990s, the OIN opened a bingo hall. Ray Halbritter (Oneida), opened a gas station known as SavOn across the street. The cheaper gasoline made the gas station popular among the community.\n\nEventually the OIN bought SavOn and expanded it into multiple locations within the area. Today \"SavOn\" (or \"SāvOn\") is a chain of gas stations and convenience stores in Oneida and Madison counties, owned and operated by the Oneida Indian Nation.\n\nThe OIN opened several casinos. The first was the Turning Stone Casino & Resort, in 1993. After the 2013 landmark settlement, the OIN opened the Yellow Brick Road Casino in June 2015. And on March 3, 2018, OIN opened the Point Place Casino in Brideport, NY.\n\nThe tribe's most profitable business is the Turning Stone Resort & Casino, which has been expanding continuously since its opening in 1993. The current game-space is approximately . Begun as a bingo hall, it has been developed as a large, Class III gaming facility and resort. The entertainment site includes nationally ranked hotels and restaurants. Many shows are performed throughout the year. The resort is the host for a fall Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) tournament.\nSome parties have challenged the tribal-state gaming compact between the OIN and New York state. The 2013 agreement between the OIN, Madison and Oneida Counties, and New York resolved all challenges to the casino.\n\nIn 2016, the casino and resort underwent a $20 million upgrade and renovation project to provide better smoke-free areas on the gambling floor, improve ventilation facilities, add a cafeteria, and add/upgrade rooms.\n\nIn June 2015, the OIN opened a casino based on themes from the popular book and film, \"The Wizard of Oz\", indirectly honoring writer L. Frank Baum, who was from Central New York. The facility is located in Tops Plaza, 800 W. Genesee St., Chittenango, NY and contains of gaming space with over 400 slot machines; open 24/7. Table games are held Sunday-Wednesday, 11am - 11pm; Thursday, 11am - 12am; Friday, 11am - 3am; and Saturday 10am-3am.\n\nOther Native Americans have criticized this choice, as Baum was noted for supporting genocide against the Sioux Nation. \"The Washington Post\" noted that their choice was a problem, as the Oneida have led the effort to force the Washington Redskins to change their name by dropping the derogatory reference to Native Americans.\n\nLocated at 450 NY-31, Bridgeport, NY, this facility contains gaming space. It is the newest casino the Oneida Nation Enterprises operates and it entirely smoke-free. Visitors can choose from over 500 slot machines and 20 classic table games. Table game hours are Sunday - Thursday 10am - 12am and Friday - Saturday 10am - 3am.\n\nThe OIN has purchased a marina on the south-eastern shore of Oneida Lake and many plots of land in the area.\n\nThe Indian Country Media Network (ICMN) was owned by the Oneida Nation of New York until 2017; it included the \"Indian Country Today\" online newspaper. That year the OOIN donated the news organization's assets to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). The NCAI has continued to publish \"Indian Country Today\" online.\n\nSince the 1970s, the OIN have been involved in several lawsuits involving real property. In the 70s, the OIN filed suit seeking recovery of the original land grant contained in the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua arguing the land was improperly transferred in violation of federal law and the US Constitution. As time progressed, the OIN began purchasing real property within this original grant as it became available. The OIN asserted its limited sovereignty status to claim the properties exempt from county and state property taxes. This culminated in several additional suits preceding the 2013 landmark agreement.\n\nIn 1970 and 1974, the OIN, Oneida Nation of Wisconsin and the Oneida Nation of the Thames (Canada) filed lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York; they alleged that the reservation land granted to them by a treaty between the OIN and New York State was taken from the Oneida people (from their historic territory) and the treaty was never ratified by the Senate, making it unconstitutional. The state did not have authority under the US Constitution to deal directly with the Indian nations. The Oneida said that they still legally owned the lands in question.\n\nIn 1970, the OIN filed a \"test\" case in federal court, suing Oneida and Madison counties for two years' rent (1968-1969) on county-owned acreage; the rent amounted to $16,694. The OIN argue that as the original action by the state was unconstitutional, they still owned the land and were owed rent by the counties. The United States District Court for the Northern District of New York dismissed the action, and the OIN appealed. On July 12, 1972, the Second Circuit United States Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s decision. The OIN petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to grant \"cert.\" In \"Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida\" (1974), the Supreme Court decided in favor of the Oneida Indian Nation.\n\nOn July 12, 1977, on remand to the District Court with Judge Edmund Port presiding, the Court sided with the OIN. The counties appealed to the Second Circuit, which affirmed Judge Port's decision. The counties had argued the OIN did not have standing for its claim, and the claim was too old and should not be considered. The counties petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of \"cert.\", which the court granted.\n\nOn March 4, 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court opined in favor of the OIN in a 5 to 4 vote. The Court opined three principles\"\n\"The question whether equitable considerations should limit the relief available to the present day Oneida Indians was not addressed by the Court of Appeals or presented to this Court by petitioners. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether other considerations may be relevant to the final disposition of this case should Congress not exercise its authority to resolve these far-reaching Indian claims.\"\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissent: \n\"This decision upsets long-settled expectations in the ownership of real property in the Counties of Oneida and Madison, New York, and the disruption it is sure to cause will confirm the common law wisdom that ancient claims are best left in repose. The Court, no doubt, believes that it is undoing a grave historical injustice, but in so doing it has caused another, which only Congress may now rectify.\"\n\nIn 1998, the United States Department of Justice intervened in the lawsuits on the plaintiff's behalf in order for the claim to proceed against New York State because the state asserted its immunity under the 11th Amendment. Based on \"City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation\" and \"Cayuga Indian Nation v New York\", the Defendants moved for summary judgment. On May 21, 2007, Judge Kahn dismissed the OIN's possessory land claims and allowed the non-possessory claims to proceed.\n\nBoth parties appealed Judge Kahn's decision. In a decision dated August 9, 2010, the Second Circuit opined that the non-possessory claims could not proceed and remanded the case back to the district court to enter a judgement in favor of the State and Counties. The OIN appealed to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe OIN has purchased lands which had been part of its historic reservation, as established by treaty with New York State. These had later been sold to the state and subsequently to non-Indians. For some time, the OIN and the state believed that the OIN's purchase of the land restored the property to its status as Indian Territory under Oneida possession.\n\nState law prohibits Class III gaming facilities. The OIN developed its resort and casino on what was understood to be its federal reservation, where that action was authorized under tribal sovereignty.\n\nThe city of Sherrill challenged the OIN by trying to collect property taxes on the land the tribe bought in that jurisdiction, where it developed its casino. In \"City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation\" (2005), which went to the US Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg determined that the land the casino is on was part of the original tribal lands. But, Justice Ginsburg held that although the land may be part of an ancient reservation land grant, as the OIN had not controlled it for more than 200 years, during which time it was non-Indian territory, the tribe could not re-establish its immunity (from state law) over those lands.\n\nTo \"re-establish sovereign authority\" over ancient tribal lands which the Oneida had re-acquired on the open market, the U.S. Supreme Court said that the \"proper avenue\" for the Oneida Indian Nation was through § 465 of the Indian Reorganization Act. The OIN needed to apply to the Department of the Interior to place the disputed lands into federal trust.\n\nComments on the court decision varied. The issue in \"Sherrill\" was whether the city could levy property taxes on OIN's re-acquired tribal lands. The US Supreme Court determined that the City of Sherrill could levy property taxes. But the court failed to overturn the Second Circuit's finding that the land qualified as Indian Territory.\n\nOIN supporters argue that \"Sherrill\" stands only to say that the OIN cannot re-instate its tax immunity, but that the land is Indian Land. UCE and its supporters disagreed; they counter that the \"Sherrill\" ruling provided a blanket approval for the jurisdictions to foreclose on all OIN property that owe back taxes. Some UCE members interpreted the ruling as making the OIN casino operation illegal under state law. They speculate that it should be closed until the state and the tribe reach a new agreement on gaming.\n\nIn April 2005, the OIN applied to the Department of Interior to have this land taken into federal trust on its behalf. By letter dated June 10, 2005, Associate Deputy Secretary Cason advised Ray Halbritter, the tribe's lead on this issue, of its position: \n\"Department of Interior’s (\"DOI\") position with respect to certain issues related to the status of OIN lands ... we do not agree with [the] assertion that the Court’s ruling in Sherrill recognizes the continuation of restriction on alienation protections over recently re-acquired lands ... it is our opinion that Court in \"City of Sherrill\" unmistakably held that the lands at issue (property interests purchased by OIN on the open market) are subject to real property taxes. In the event these taxes are not paid, we believe such lands are subject to foreclosure. Further, please be advised that the BIA is in the process of taking appropriate action to clarify that its recordation of OIN deeds does not have the legal effect of designating these lands as restricted against alienation pursuant to 25 USC 177.\"\n\nIn order to accept the lands as federal trust property, the BIA had to prepare an environmental assessment of the action. On February 27, 2008, the BIA released its Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on taking the lands in question into trust on behalf of the OIN. It recommended that be placed into trust. After this announcement, the DOI gave a 30-day comment period and announced that it would have a decision on or after March 25, 2008.\n\nSome government officials expressed concern about creating a \"patchwork of taxable and tax-exempt properties,\" making a \"jurisdictional nightmare.\" However, a sting operation conducted in conjunction with OIN Police and the Oneida County Sheriff disproved this argument.\n\nIn opposing the OIN's land-into-trust application, New York State raised the question of whether the Indian Reorganization Act applies to the OIN, as the OIN had rejected reorganizing according to its rules, by a vote of 12 to 57 on June 17, 1936. According to the letter from Richard Platkin, Counsel to the Governor, to Franklin Keel, citing Michael T. Smith's Memorandum to Director, Office of Indian Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs, dated February 24, 1982, \"the Oneida were considered not eligible, but in a reconsideration based on the discussion in the case of 'US v Boylan', the Department of Interior changed its position and conducted the referendum.\"\n\nThe OIN have noted that, as early as 1910, they have been a federally recognized tribe. The OIN is part of the original Oneida tribe that was party to the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua. In unrelated cases involving other Indian tribes and whether the IRA applied to them, the BIA issued a ruling that the fact that a tribe conducted a vote related to reorganizing under the IRA, was sufficient to establish that an Indian Tribe was under federal jurisdiction in 1934. A 1980 BIA memorandum determined that the phrase \"recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction\" includes tribes that existed in 1934 and had a continuing course of dealing with the United State or some other legal obligation. To this day, the United States honors its legal obligations to the OIN under the 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua. Any flawed claim that the OIN is not a federally recognized tribe was unequivocally debunked in the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in 2016, where the Court affirmed, inter alia, that the OIN is an Indian Tribe within the meaning of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.\n\nOn December 23, 2013, the BIA issued an amendment to its 2008 record of decision, accepting 13,082 acres into federal trust. In that amendment, the BIA unequivocally determined that the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 is applicable to the OIN not only by virtue of the vote held, but also by the \"Boylan\" litigation, the 1794 Treaty of Canadaigua, and the historical record. As noted below, New York State, and Oneida and Madison Counties have agreed to this decision's validity and discontinued any legal challenge, in perpetuity.\n\nOn March 2008, County Executive Anthony Picente held a public meeting to discuss the possibility of negotiating a settlement before the March 25 deadline. Congressman Arcuri tried to stall the decision by seeking to block such a settlement through legislation. While criticized by both sides for killing any progress made between the two sides, Arcuri said he wanted to encourage negotiations.\n\nOn January 2008, Halbritter sent a proposed settlement offer to the state and the county, but did not receive a response before DOI announced its decision. The OIN offered to negotiate an agreement pertaining to future trust applications, but the state and local governments have not responded.\n\nOn May 20, 2008, the DOI announced that it would take into trust. The OIN offered to negotiate and settle the issues involved, while the state and county officials promised continued litigation.\n\nOn or about June 17, 2008, two groups filed separate lawsuits in federal court challenging the DOI's decision.; UCE's suit challenges the DOI's authority to take the land into trust under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, alleging that this trust decision violates the United States Constitution. The other group alleges that the DOI's decision was arbitrary and capricious because some of the trust land is subject to outstanding litigation between the group and the OIN.\n\nOn June 19, 2008 (the deadline to file suit), New York State, Oneida and Madison counties filed their suits in federal court. The state and county governments' arguments are similar to those of UCE. The opposing parties allege that the DOI's decision violates the United States constitution and that the DOI's decision was arbitrary.\n\nBy letter dated January 7, 2009, Steven Miskinis, Esq. of the U.S. Department of Justice notified the Court (in which the above-mentioned challenges to the May 20, 2008 determination are pending) that the U.S. has taken of land known as the former United States Air Force Space Command Complex at the Verona Research Facility, Germany Road, Verona, New York into trust for the OIN. Two days later, the Assistant Attorney General for the State of New York objected to this action. He requested an expedited conference and asked that the United States voluntarily refrain from any further efforts to transfer land into trust for the Nation. Judge Kahn dismissed UCE's complaint, including the failed theory that the IRA is unconstitutional, on the basis of longstanding and settled law on this issue.\n\nAs detailed below, on May 16, 2013, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente, Madison County Board of Supervisors Chairman John Becker, and Oneida Indian Nation leader Ray Halbritter announced a deal that settled all of their differences. Before the deal became effective, the majority of each government's legislative branches had to approve it. The key components of the agreement are as follows: \n\nIn 2013, the OIN renewed a campaign to compel the Washington Redskins to change their team name and mascot. The OIN leader Halbritter launched the website \"Change the Mascot.\" In 2014-2015 there was new publicity related to this national campaign, with other Native American tribes participating.\n\nThe OIN has both internal and external opposition. Internally, members of the Wolf Clan in particular protest Halbritter's assumption of power and dissolving of the traditional Oneida government, which was based on hereditary leaders for life.\n\n\"Shenandoah v. United States DOI,\" 159 F.3d 708, (2d Cir. 1998) was a lawsuit that challenged the legitimacy and authority of Ray Halbritter to act on behalf of the OIN. Specifically,\n\n\"In 1977, members of the Oneida Nation appointed Halbritter and two other Nation members as interim representatives of the Nation. On April 25, 1993, the Grand Council, consisting of representatives from all six Iroquois nations, including the Oneida Nation, purported to remove Halbritter from his position as interim Nation representative. The Department [of Interior] acknowledged the removal on August 10, 1993, but the next day stayed its acknowledgment pending BIA review. After requesting the Nation to conduct a referendum to select a representative, the Department agreed to Halbritter's proposal to submit \"statements of support\" from Nation members. On February 4, 1994, the Department notified Halbritter that it would continue to recognize him as the Nation's permanent representative until such time as he resigned or was removed by the Nation in accordance with certain procedures. According to plaintiffs, on May 21, 1995, the Nation once again removed Halbritter from his position as Oneida representative. Although informed of Halbritter's alleged second removal, the Department had not acted upon that notification by the time of oral argument, and as of the time of this opinion, we have received no information to the contrary.\"\n\nThe district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss both the non-habeas and habeas claims of the plaintiffs. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court.\n\nExternal opposition comes from organizations such as Upstate Citizens for Equality (UCE), a group that opposed Haudenosaunee land claims in upstate New York. UCE also opposed the OIN being able to operate its enterprises tax-free on land it asserted sovereign status. These issues were resolved by the 2013 landmark agreement.\n\nDisputes have arisen with the state over the OIN's economic advantage of operating the Class III gaming facility without having to collect or pay state taxes on retail sales at the resort. The tribe does pay a portion of the revenues to the state under the gaming compact, (essentially in lieu of taxes). The OIN and other parties believed operations on property it controlled were tax free. \"City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation\", 544 US 197 (2005).\n\nVernon Downs opened a casino to try to compete with Turning Stone. It is heavily taxed under state law. Downs struggles to operate and, in late 2007, many of his original investors pulled out of the venture. The Upstate Citizens for Equality and supporters attribute his failure to the OIN being able to operate its casino tax free.\n\nOIN supporters attribute Downs' troubles to the state collecting a total of 54% of the revenue in taxes, making profitability difficult. In early 2008, the director Steve Gural closed down the racino at Vernon Downs for three days.[7] He was trying to make the state decrease its rate of taxation of the facility, to enable it to be more profitable.[8] This period of closure cost the state approximately $1.5 million in lost tax revenues. (The state has earmarked revenues from gambling for education, which was part of the original campaign to have voters approve the state's authorization of gaming activities.)[8] Many argued that the state should not call this \"lost revenue.\" Building the track created the revenue; without the track, there would be no revenue. The track was facing insolvency.\n\nThe OIN asserted that it made up for this lack of land tax by donating to local schools in amounts that exceed the taxes which the county would normally receive from the land plots, in a program known as the Silver Covenant Chain Education Grants. As tensions increased between the various local governments, the state government, and the OIN, the OIN decreased or stopped the donations.\n\nStockbridge Valley School has several OIN children as students, but the OIN has discontinued grants to the school because it disapproved of the views of one teacher. In late fall 2003, an OIN representative contacted the Stockbridge Valley Community School District and advised that it would not make the Silver Covenant unless a particular teaching assistant was fired.\n\n\"Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v Gould\", 14 NY3d 614 [2010] is a case brought on the issue of whether federally recognized Indian Tribes, such as the OIN, have to collect state sales taxes from retail sales to non-Indian consumers made within their reservation. According to the Court of Appeals in \"Gould\", the Indian Tribe is not subject to State tax law. For purposes of the State Tax Law, the Nation's retail operations on its lands, even if reacquired on the open market, are not subject to state tax law.\n\nOn May 8, 2009, Anthony Picente, Oneida County Executive, announced a pact between Oneida County and the OIN. The Oneida County Board of Legislators and the State legislature would have had to approve this pact within the next 60 days. If this pact had been approved, the OIN would have paid $55 million to Oneida County over the next 10 years, beginning with a $30 million lump sum payment the same year. Additionally, the OIN would have made make Silver Covenant Grants for the next five years, in order to apply for more trust land without county opposition. In return for this, the county would have agreed to drop its lawsuits and satisfy all pending tax lien and tax foreclosure proceedings. The OIN would have agreed to impose a sales tax on all businesses situated on its lands equal to Oneida County's sales tax rate. This OIN sales tax would have been imposed on all non-Indian patrons as well as tribal members.\n\nThe pact would have required the Oneida County Sheriff and the OIN Police Department to negotiate a law enforcement pact to settle questions of jurisdictional authority and operations. On May 27, 2009, the County Board of Legislators rejected the proposed pact, citing many reasons for rejecting the proposed agreement.\n\nOn May 16, 2013, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the OIN reached a settlement agreement between the state, and Oneida and Madison counties. The agreement resolved multiple legal issues between the parties. Pursuant to the agreement, the OIN would pay 25% of its revenue to the State, a quarter of which is paid to Oneida County and Madison County. These monies are to offset any property and sales taxes the Counties would otherwise receive if the property remained on the tax rolls. The State and Madison and Oneida counties agree to withdraw their objections to the OIN's land-trust application, with a cap of that can be transferred to the federal government. The OIN will have a 10-county (Oneida, Madison, Onondaga, Cayuga, Herkmimer, Oswego, Cortland, Chenango, Otsego, and Lewis counties) geographic gambling monopoly. The OIN will implement a sales tax system to tax products sold to non-Indians on Indian Territory, such as cigarettes. And the agreement would terminate all related litigation between the OIN, the state, and Madison and Oneida Counties. This agreement required the State Legislature, the Oneida County and Madison County Boards of Legislators, the US Department of the Interior, and the Judiciary to ratify this agreement.\n\nOn May 28, 2013, the Oneida County Board of Legislators approved the agreement in a 16-13 vote. On May 29, 2013, New York State, through Governor Cuomo, signed the agreement. On May 30, 2013, the Madison County Board of Supervisors approved the agreement in a weighted vote of 847-653. On January 1, 2014, the US Department of the Interior approved of the agreement. On June 22, 2013, both the state Senate (48-11) and the state Assembly (83-44) approved the agreement. The final entity to approve the agreement was the Judiciary. On March 4, 2014, US District Court Judge Kahn approved the settlement agreement. On September 4, 2014, the of OIN real property was formally transferred into US trust.\n\nOn August 19, 2013, the Towns of Vernon and Verona jointly filed a lawsuit to oppose the ratified settlement, citing a violation of their freedom of speech and equal protection. On October 30, 2013, US District Court Judge Kahn remanded the lawsuit to the state court system because the towns lacked standing. On June 27, 2014, Albany County Supreme Court denied and dismissed the lawsuit.\n\nOneida County offered an OIN revenue sharing agreement with at least five municipalities affected most by the 2013 landmark agreement. The five municipalities offered this deal are the City of Sherrill, Town of Sylvan, Town of Verona, Village of Vernon, and Town of Augusta. On May 27, 2014 the Sherrill City Commission voted 3-1 to accept $160,000 annually from Oneida County, in exchange for the current commission and future commissions waiving their right to challenge the settlement. On May 29, 2014, the Vernon Village Board unanimously agreed to receive annual payments of $60,000 from Oneida County in exchange for the current board and future boards waiving their right to challenge the settlement. On June 7, 2014, the Town of Augusta accepted an agreement with Oneida County. By a 3-1 vote, the town will receive $107,500 a year as compensation for lost property tax revenue based on OIN trust lands.\n\nSince then, several other municipalities and school districts have requested to become part of the OIN revenue sharing agreement. However, to do this, Oneida County is trying to undo its agreements with the prior municipalities in order to do a new agreement that covers all of the affected municipalities. This has drawn strong opposition from the original municipalities that accepted the initial agreement.\n\n\n"}

Because Pakistan and Afghanistan are neighbouring states with a loosely controlled border, and a distributed population of ethnic Pashtuns and Baloch people, there is constant flow of population between the two countries.\n\nDynasties, such as those of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughals, as well as nomad people from the Indian subcontinent (including modern-day Pakistan) have been invading and coming to Afghanistan for the past many centuries. Before the mid-19th century, Afghanistan and the entire present-day Pakistan were part of the Durrani Empire and ruled by a successive line of Pashtun kings who had their capitals in Afghan cities. In 1857, in his review of J.W. Kaye's \"The Afghan War\", Friedrich Engels describes \"Afghanistan\" as: Thus, interaction and migration between the native people in this region was common. After the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the Durand Line was established in the late 1800s for fixing the limits of sphere of influence between Mortimer Durand of British India and Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. When Pakistan inherited this single-page agreement in 1947, which was basically to end political interference beyond the frontier line between Afghanistan and what was then colonial British India, it divided the indigenous ethnic Pashtun and Baloch tribes. \n\nDuring the 1980s Soviet war, a large number of Pakistan-based Mujahideen forces began crossing the Pak-Afghan border into Afghanistan to fight the Soviets and the Soviet-backed Afghan government. \n\nAfter the death of Massoud and the removal of the Taliban regime of Afghanistan in late 2001 by US-led coalition forces, members of the Taliban regrouped and began a strong insurgency campaign inside Afghanistan. The insurgents are members of Afghan-based and Afghan-led militant groups such as the Afghan Taliban (including the Quetta Shura chapter), the Haqqani network, or al-Qaida and others. The militant groups include a small number of Pakistanis and other Muslim foreigners among their ranks.\n\nIn January 2008, BBC reported that about 6,000 Pakistanis from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa crossed into Afghanistan, which included women and children. While fighting in northwest-Pakistan between the Pakistani Armed Forces and the Pakistani Taliban may have been one reason, Sunni Shia sectarian strife was also suggested as a possible driver for their flight. They were able to receive medical aid in Khost and Paktika provinces. By September 2008, their number had reached 20,000, and about 70% of the refugees were Pakistanis while the rest were Afghans who had settled in Pakistan during the last 20 or so years. More Pakistani refugees went to Afghanistan after the 2010 Pakistan floods. As of 2015, around 221,432 Pakistanis are found living in Afghanistan. Most of them are in Khost Province and Paktika Province. There are also a small number of Pakistani Baloch migrants, mainly concentrated in the southern parts of Afghanistan like Nimruz.\n\nPakistani expatriates have been involved in the rebuilding and reconstruction of Afghanistan and have made contributions towards the Afghan economy. By 2006, there were about 60,000 Pakistanis working in Afghanistan; the exact number was unclear because of the lack of government records. Pakistanis could be found working not just in the main cities such as Kandahar, but also less-accessible provinces such as Ghazni, Wardak, or Helmand. Many work in the construction sector, while others have found white-collar jobs such as information technology professionals for United Nations organisations and foreign companies in urban areas; they have an increasing demand due to their skills and mostly originate from the northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. As many as one-sixth cross the border on any given day.\n\nIn May 2011, several expatriate Pakistanis crossing the border at Torkham were routinely being harassed and bothered by intelligence agencies in Pakistan; some were asked repetitive questions as to why they were going to Afghanistan while others had their materials and laptops searched. The expatriates sent a complaint and brought the issue to the notice of the Pakistani ambassador in Kabul, Muhammad Sadiq.\n\nHowever, NATO and Afghan officials also blame Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy network for being involved in terrorist attacks. Pakistan and Afghanistan have an irregular and poorly marked border. This allows militants to frequently cross back and forth across the border unchecked and undetected. A few of the insurgents and militants in Afghan resistance groups were of Pakistani origin. They have been arrested in the last decade and are held in different prisons across the country. They are usually from regions along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, including the Waziristan region, the city of Quetta and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, and engaged in attacks against US-led NATO forces and the Government of Afghanistan. NATO and Afghan officials also blame Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy network for being involved in some of the attacks. Besides the serious criminals, there are unknown number of Pakistani prisoners in Afghanistan who are held for visa violation or petty crimes.\n\n"}
{"id": "46957862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46957862", "title": "Peter Scully", "text": "Peter Scully\n\nPeter Gerard Scully (born 13 January 1963) is an Australian convicted child sex abuser. In June 2018, he was found guilty of one count of human trafficking and five counts of rape and sentenced to life in prison. He remains on trial for numerous other crimes against children, including the production and dissemination of sadistic child pornography, torture and murder.\n\nIn 2011 Scully fled from Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, to the Philippines before he could be charged with 117 fraud and deception offences relating to his involvement with a crooked property scheme. From the island of Mindanao he is alleged to have built up a lucrative international pedophile ring that offered pay-per-view video streams of children being tortured and sexually abused on the dark web. Among the victims who had their videoed ordeals sold over the Internet was an 18 month old infant who was hung upside down while Scully and two accomplices raped and tortured her.\n\nVictims were procured by Scully with promises to impoverished parents of work, educating their child and the like, or by his two Filipino girlfriends, Carme Ann Alvarez and Liezyl Margallo, and other female acquaintances such as Maria Dorothea Chi y Chia. Both Alvarez and Margallo also abused children in Scully's videos.\n\nOne instance involved the entrapment of two cousins, aged 9 and 12, who might perhaps have narrowly avoided being murdered. After Alvarez, a former child prostitute whom Scully had picked up off the streets and groomed to be a compliant accomplice, had coaxed the two girls back to Scully's abode with a promise of food, he forced them to perform sex acts on each other, which he photographed and videoed. With Alvarez's assistance, Scully also sexually abused both of them. The girls were kept chained in dog collars and, after an escape attempt, were made to dig what they were told would be their own graves. After five days of abuse, Alvarez took pity on them, releasing them and letting them escape. The cousins went to the police; Alvarez was arrested and Scully went on the run.\n\nThe most notorious of Scully's output was titled \"Daisy's Destruction\", which he sold to clients for up to $10,000. Made in 2012, the multi-part film is so extreme that it was for some time regarded as an urban legend. It features the torture and brutal rape of a number of girls by Scully and some Filipina accomplices; the three main victims were Liza (aged 12), Cindy (11) and Daisy (18 months).\n\nUrged on by Scully, some of the worst physical and sexual abuse was carried out on the children by one of his girlfriends, Liezyl Margallo, a former child prostitute then 19 years old. Indeed, it seems Margallo was the sole hands-on victimizer of Daisy: The introduction to the film invites the viewer to watch Daisy's \"mental ruin\" as she \"learn[s] how to please her mistress\".\n\nScully put \"Daisy's Destruction\" out under his No Limits Fun \"production company\", selling it to other pedophiles via the dark web. Among those who acquired it was one of the biggest ever purveyors of child pornography, Scully's fellow Australian Matthew David Graham. Apprehended at age 22, he ran a series of \"hurtcore\" child pornography sites. Graham said he got the video so he could use it to attract more viewers to his network of websites.\n\nAfter \"Daisy's Destruction\" surfaced, an international manhunt was launched. Scully was eventually tracked to Malaybalay City in the Philippines and arrested on 20 February 2015. Investigators had six warrants for his arrest, all relating to the abduction and sexual abuse of the two cousins.\n\nWhile they searched for Scully in the Philippines, investigators managed to uncover the fates of the three primary victims in \"Daisy's Destruction\". Liza was found to be alive, as was Daisy, though her treatment had been so vicious that she has lasting physical injuries. Eleven-year-old Cindy had been murdered, allegedly by Scully. Before being strangled to death with a rope, the girl was subjected to bouts of rape and torture, and was made to dig her own grave. According to Margallo, Scully videotaped himself killing Cindy.\n\nScully faced a total of 75 charges. He was on trial with others who assisted in the production of his pornography, including four men — Germany's Christian Rouche, Filipinos Alexander Lao and Althea Chia and a Brazilian doctor, Haniel Caetano de Oliveira.\n\nIn October 2015, a fire severely damaged the evidence room containing Scully's computer logs and videos, destroying key evidence. Some believe Scully may have bribed a local police officer, as corruption in the Philippines is high.\n\nMargaret Akullo, then Project Coordinator for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and an expert on child abuse investigations, described the case as \"horrific\" and the worst she had ever heard of.\n\nIn 2017, Scully escaped the looming threat of capital punishment after Philippine politicians excluded the crimes of rape, treason and plunder from a bill that reintroduced capital punishment to the country. Supporters of the bill agreed to exclude such crimes from the list of those punishable by the death penalty so as to permit smoother passage of the bill through Congress. The law passed by 216 votes to 54.\n\n"}
{"id": "343614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343614", "title": "Pollinator decline", "text": "Pollinator decline\n\nThe term pollinator decline refers to the reduction in abundance of insect and other animal pollinators in many ecosystems worldwide beginning at the end of the 20th century, and continuing into the present.\n\nPollinators participate in sexual reproduction of many plants, by ensuring cross-pollination, essential for some species, or a major factor in ensuring genetic diversity for others. Since plants are the primary food source for animals, the reduction of one of the primary pollination agents, or even their possible disappearance, has raised concern, and the conservation of pollinators has become part of biodiversity conservation efforts.\n\nPollinators, which are necessary for 75% of food crops, are declining globally in both abundance and diversity. Bees, in particular, are thought to be necessary for the fertilization of up to 90% of the world's 107 most important human food crops.\n\nThe decline in bee numbers has attracted much public attention. Members of the British Beekeepers' Association have issued numerous warnings in the 21st century that the country's bees are in rapid decline. Writing in 2013, Elizabeth Grossman noted that the winter losses of beehives had increased in recent years in Europe and the United States, with a hive failure rate up to 50%. In France, the honey harvest for 2017 has been estimated at around 10,000 tons, representing a decline of two-thirds against the average annual harvest during the 1990s.\n\nA 2017 study led by Radboud University's Hans de Kroon, using 1,500 samples from 63 sites, indicated that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three-quarters in the previous 25 years. Participating researcher Dave Goulson of Sussex University stated that their study suggested that humans are making large parts of the planet uninhabitable for wildlife. Goulson characterized the situation as an approaching \"ecological Armageddon\", adding that \"if we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse\". Lynn Dicks at the University of East Anglia in 2017 estimated the rate of decline in flying insect biomass at roughly 6% a year.\n\nThe value of animal pollination in human nutrition and food for wildlife is immense and difficult to quantify.\n\nAn estimated 87.5% of the world's flowering plant species are animal-pollinated, and 35% of crop production and 60% of crop plant species depend on animal pollinators. This includes the majority of fruits, many vegetables (or their seed crop), and secondary effects from legumes such as alfalfa and clover fed to livestock.\n\nIn 2000, Drs. Roger Morse and Nicholas Calderone of Cornell University attempted to quantify the effects of just one pollinator, the western honey bee, on only US food crops. Their calculations came up with a figure of US$14.6 billion in food crop value. In 2009, another study calculated the worldwide value of pollination to agriculture. They calculated the costs using the proportion of each of 100 crops that need pollinators that would not be produced in case insect pollinators disappeared completely. The economic value of insect pollination was then of €153 billion.\n\nSeveral large-scale studies have looked at the nutritional consequences of pollinator decline. Since pollinators are responsible for propagating certain plants and crops, populations that are heavily reliant on those crops are at risk for malnutrition. As such, the size of the effect that pollinator decline has on an area depends on the local diet. According to a 2015 study published in the Public Library of Science, pollinator decline is most likely to have negative impacts on the nutritional health of an area when the people living there get the majority of their nutrients from crops that are heavily dependent on pollinators, the affected people are not already severely deficient in a nutrient or consuming significantly higher amounts of the nutrient than is recommended, they do not have access to other foods that could substitute the nutrients from the crops they are losing, and they do not have access to supplements, fortified foods, or targeted nutrition programs that could help ensure they are still getting adequate nutrients. In contrast, populations whose diets are not heavily based on pollinator-dependent crops likely will not be affected by pollinator decline to the same extent.\n\nA 2015 study done by the Harvard School of Public Health modeled what would happen should 100% of pollinators die off. In that scenario, 71 million people in low-income countries would become deficient in vitamin A, and the vitamin A intake of 2.2 billion people who are already consuming less than the recommended amount would further decline. Similarly, 173 million people would become deficient in folate, and 1.23 million people would further lessen their intake. Additionally, the global fruit supply would decrease by 22.9%, the global vegetable supply would decrease by 16.3%, and the global supply of nuts and seeds would decrease by 22.1%. This would lead to 1.42 million additional deaths each year from noncommunicable and malnutrition-related diseases, as well as 27 million disability-adjusted life years. In a less extreme scenario wherein only 50% of pollinators die off, 700,000 additional deaths would occur each year, as well as 13.2 million disability-adjusted years.\n\nIn a 2014 study done in the United Kingdom, vitamin A was identified as the most pollinator-dependent nutrient. Vitamin A deficiency is one of the biggest malnutrition concerns when it comes to pollinator decline, as it is one of the leading causes of blindness, accounting for 500,000 cases annually. Vitamin A deficiency is also responsible for the deaths of about 800,000 women and children worldwide, as well as between 20% and 24% of deaths from measles, diarrhea, and malaria. An estimated 70% of dietary vitamin A worldwide is found in crops that are animal pollinated.\n\nFolate deficiency, a type of vitamin B, is also of concern. An estimated 55% of folate is found in animal-pollinated crops such as beans and dark, leafy, green vegetables. Folate is highly recommended for pregnant women, as it helps to prevent neural tube defects in fetuses.\n\nCalcium, fluoride, and iron deficiencies are also likely consequences of pollinator decline. Animal pollinators are responsible for 9%, 20%, and 29% of fruits and nuts that contain calcium, fluoride, and iron, respectively. While those percentages are not high compared to how much of those nutrients come from meat and dairy, fruits and nuts are more bioavailable. More so, meat and dairy production is expensive, inefficient, and not feasible in certain areas. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide, leading to preventable cognitive impairment and infection.\n\nAdditionally, 74% of all globally produced lipids are found in oils from plants that are animal pollinated, as well as 98% of vitamin C.\n\nSome international initiatives (e.g. the International Pollinator Initiative (IPI)) highlight the need for public participation and awareness of pollinator, such as bees, conservation.\n\nPollinators and their health have become growing concerns, resulting in an increase in public awareness. Around 18 states within America have responded to these concerns by creating legislation to address the issue. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, the enacted legislation in those states addresses five specific areas relating to pollinator decline: \"awareness; research; pesticides; habitat protection; and beekeeping\".\n\nProbable explanations for the decline in pollinators can be attributed to the use of pesticides, pests and diseases, habitat destruction, air pollution, pollinators' reaction to climate change, the effects of monoculture (especially in regards to bees), and the intraspecific competition and interspecific competition between \"native and introduced or invasive species\".\n\nStudies have linked neonicotinoid pesticide exposure to bee health decline. These studies add to a growing body of scientific literature and strengthen the case for removing pesticides toxic to bees from the market. Pesticides interfere with honey bee brains, affecting their ability to navigate. Pesticides prevent bumble bees from collecting enough food to produce new queens.\n\nNeonicotinoids are highly toxic to a range of insects, including honey bees and other pollinators. They are taken up by a plant’s vascular system and expressed through pollen, nectar, and guttation droplets from which bees forage and drink. They are particularly dangerous because, in addition to being acutely toxic in high doses, they also result in serious sublethal effects when insects are exposed to chronic low doses, as they are through pollen and water droplets laced with the chemical, as well as dust that is released into the air when coated seeds are planted. These effects cause significant problems for the health of individual honey bees, as well as the overall health of honey bee colonies, and they include disruptions in mobility, navigation, feeding behavior, foraging activity, memory and learning, and overall hive activity.\n\nA French 2012 study of \"Apis mellifera\" (western honey bee or European honey bee) that focused on the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam, which is metabolized by bees into clothianidin, a pesticide cited in legal action, tested the hypothesis that a sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid indirectly increases hive death rate through homing failure in foraging honey bees. When exposed to sublethal doses of thiamethoxam, at levels present in the environment, honey bees were less likely to return to the hive after foraging than control bees that were tracked with radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagging technology, but not intentionally dosed with pesticides. Higher risks are observed when the homing task is more challenging. The survival rate is even lower when exposed bees are placed in foraging areas with which they are less familiar.\n\nIn their 2014 study of \"Bombus terrestris\" (buff-tailed bumblebee or large earth bumblebee), researchers tracked bees using RFID tagging technology, and found that a sublethal exposure to either imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and/or a pyrethroid (?-cyhalothrin) over a four-week period caused impairment of the bumblebee's ability to forage.\n\nImidacloprid effects on bees were examined by researchers exposing colonies of bumblebees to levels of imidacloprid that are realistic in the natural environment, then allowed them to develop under field conditions. Treated colonies had a significantly reduced growth rate and suffered an 85% reduction in production of new queens compared to unexposed control colonies. The study shows that bumblebees, which are wild pollinators, are suffering similar impacts of pesticide exposure to \"managed\" honey bees. Wild pollinators provide ecosystem services both in agriculture and to a wide range of wild plants that could not survive without insect pollination.\n\nIn March, 2012, commercial beekeepers and environmental organizations filed an emergency legal petition with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to suspend use of clothianidin, urging the agency to adopt safeguards. The legal petition, supported by over one million citizen petition signatures, targets the pesticide for its harmful impacts on honey bees. The petition points to the fact that the EPA failed to follow its own regulations. EPA granted a conditional, or temporary, registration of clothianidin in 2003 without a field study establishing that the pesticide would have no \"unreasonable adverse effects\" on pollinators. The conditional registration was contingent upon the submission of an acceptable field study, but this requirement has not been met. EPA continues to allow the use of clothianidin 9 years after acknowledging that it had an insufficient legal basis for initially allowing its use. Additionally, the product labels on pesticides containing clothianidin are inadequate to prevent excessive damage to nontarget organisms, which is a violation of the requirements for using a pesticide and further warrants removing all such mislabeled pesticides from use.\n\nThe disappearance of honeybees was documented in the 2009 film \"Vanishing of the Bees\" by George Langworthy and Maryam Henein.\n\nIncreased international commerce has moved diseases of the honey bee such as American foulbrood and chalkbrood, and parasites such as varroa mites, acarina mites, and the small African hive beetle to new areas of the world, causing much loss of bees in the areas where they do not have much resistance to these pests. Imported fire ants have decimated ground-nesting bees in wide areas of the southern US.\n\nBees and other pollinators face a higher risk of extinction due to loss of habitat and access to natural food sources. The global dependency on livestock and agriculture has rendered no less than 50% of the earth's landmass uninhabitable for bees. The agricultural practice of planting one crop (monoculture) in a given area year after year leads to extreme malnourishment. Regardless if the planted crop does flower and provide food for the bee, the bee will still be malnourished because a single plant cannot meet its nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the crops needed to support livestock (primarily cattle) tend to be grains which do not provide nectar. Artificial water bodies, open urban areas, large industrial facilities including heavy industry, railways and associated installations, buildings and installations with sociocultural purpose, camping, sports, playgrounds, golf courts, oilseed crops other than oilseed\nrape such as sunflower or linseed, some spring cereals and former forest clearcuts or windthrows were frequently associated with high honey bee colony losses.\n\nResearchers at UC Berkeley and UC Davis have found that if farms were to plant and maintain wildflower borders around their crop fields, they would see an eight-fold increase in bee abundance compared to farms without wildflower habitat. While most farms use managed bees, from either their own hives or rented, to pollinate their crops, wild bees can meet 100% of their pollination needs so long as they are plentiful. By maintaining wildflowers near their crops, farms would be able to resource natural pollination. The act of providing pollinators with more nutrient rich habitats, while having the benefit of \"free\" crop pollination, is a simple way to aid in the reduction of pollinator decline.\n\nResearchers at the University of Virginia have discovered that air pollution from automobiles and power plants has been inhibiting the ability of pollinators such as bees and butterflies to find the fragrances of flowers. Pollutants such as ozone, hydroxyl, and nitrate radicals bond quickly with volatile scent molecules of flowers, which consequently travel shorter distances intact. There results a vicious cycle in which pollinators travel increasingly longer distances to find flowers providing them nectar, and flowers receive inadequate pollination to reproduce and diversify.\n\nIn 2014, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that bees, butterflies, and other pollinators faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming due to alterations in the seasonal behaviour of species. Climate change was causing bees to emerge at different times in the year when flowering plants were not available.\n\nIn June 2018, the \"Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries\" released an article that discusses a possible link between the sharp decline in flying insects and also high levels of light pollution. Many studies would suggest that artificial light at night has negative impacts on insects, and scientists should therefore pay greater attention to this factor when exploring the causes of insect population decline.\n\nWild pollinators often visit a large number of plant species and plants are visited by a large number of pollinator species. All these relations together form a network of interactions between plants and pollinators. Surprising similarities were found in the structure of networks consisting of the interactions between plants and pollinators. This structure was found to be similar in very different ecosystems on different continents, consisting of entirely different species.\n\nThe structure of plant-pollinator networks may have large consequences for the way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This makes that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions. But it also means that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.\n\nSuch a community-wide collapse, involving many pollinator species, can occur suddenly when increasingly harsh conditions pass a critical point and recovery from such a collapse might not be easy. The improvement in conditions needed for pollinators to recover, could be substantially larger than the improvement needed to return to conditions at which the pollinator community collapsed.\n\nEfforts are being made to sustain pollinator diversity in agricultural and natural ecosystems by some environmental groups. Prairie restoration, establishment of wildlife preserves, and encouragement of diverse wildlife landscaping rather than mono culture lawns, are examples of ways to help pollinators.\n\nIn June 2014, the Obama administration published a fact sheet, \"The Economic Challenge Posed by Declining Pollinator Populations\", which stated that the \"President's 2015 budget recommends approximately $50 million across multiple agencies within USDA to ... strengthen pollinator habitat in core areas, double the number of acres in the Conservation Reserve Program that are dedicated to pollinator health\".\n\nThe Obama administration's 2015 budget also recommended to \"enhance research at USDA and through public-private grants, ... and increase funding for surveys to determine the impacts on pollinator losses\".\n\nSmartBees is a European research project of 16 entities (universities, research institutions and companies) funded by the EU, headquartered in Berlin. Its goal is to elicit causes of resistance to CCD, develop breeding to increase CCD resistance and to counteract the replacement of many native European bees with only two specific races.\n\nCoLOSS (Prevention of honey bee COlony LOSSes) is an international, nonprofit association headquartered in Bern, Switzerland, to \"improve the well-being of bees at a global level\", composed of researchers, veterinarians, agriculture extension specialists, and students from 69 countries. Their three core projects are standardization of methods for studying the honey bee, colony loss monitoring, and bridging research and practice.\n\nThe decline of pollinators is compensated to some extent by beekeepers becoming migratory, following the bloom northward in the spring from southern wintering locations. Migration may be for traditional honey crops, but increasingly is for contract pollination to supply the needs for growers of crops that require it.\n\nIn 2014, Honey Nut Cheerios and Burt's Bees joined forces to support the Bring Back the Bees campaign, which aims to inform people about the potentially catastrophic decline in the bee population. As of 2017, Honey Nut Cheerios has sold over 1.5 billion wildflower seeds, greatly surpassing their goal of 100 million.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25594567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25594567", "title": "Senoi", "text": "Senoi\n\nThe Senoi (also spelled Sengoi and Sng'oi) are a group of Malaysian peoples classified among the Orang Asli, the indigenous peoples of Peninsular Malaysia. They are the most numerous of the Orang Asli and widely distributed across the peninsula. The Senois speak various branches of Aslian languages which in turn a branch of Austroasiatic languages, many of them are also bilingual in the national language, Malaysian language (Bahasa Malaysia). Their main means of subsistence is swidden agriculture, which may be supplemented with hunting, fishing, gathering, and the processing and sale of forest products.\n\nThe Senoi people are also known as Sakai people among the locals. For the Malay people, the term \"sakai\" is a derogatory term in Malay language and its derivative word \"menyakaikan\" means \"to treat with arrogance and contempt\". However, for the Senoi people \"mensakai\" means \"to work together\". During the colonial British administration, Orang Asli living in the northern Malay Peninsula were classified as Sakai and to a point later it was also a term to refer to all Orang Asli. It is often misunderstood that Senoi people who have abandoned their own language for the Malay language are called the Blandas, Biduanda or Mantra people. The Blandas people are of the Senoi race from Melaka. The Blandas language or \"Bahasa Blandas\", which is a mixture of Malay language and Sakai language; is probably used predating the first arrivals of the Malay people in Melaka.\n\nThe Senoi tribes live in the central part of the Malay Peninsula, and consist of six different groups, the Semai, Temiar, Mah Meri, Jah Hut, Semaq Beri and the Cheq Wong and have a total population of about 60,000. An example of a typical Senoi (Central Sakai) people, the purest of the Sakai are found in Jeram Kawan, Batang Padang District, Perak.\n\nThe Senois speak various sub-branches of Aslian languages. The Aslian languages are divided into several branches namely Jahaic, Semelaic, Senoic and Jah Hut. Most Senois speak a branch of Semelaic, Senoic and Jah Hut branches. Almost all Senoic and Semelaic branches are spoken by Senoi peoples (with the exception of the Lanoh people (also known as Sakai Jeram people) which is classified as Semang but speak a branch of Senoic languages and Semelai which is classified as Proto-Malay but speak a branch of Semelaic languages. Jah Hut language is an isolate within Aslian languages.\n\nTheir ancestors are believed to have arrived from southern Thailand about 4,500 years ago.\n\nDuring the Malayan Emergency, the guerrilla war fought from 1948 to 1960 a small fighting force, the Senoi Praaq was created, which is now part of the General Operations Force of the Royal Malaysia Police.\n\nKilton Stewart, who had travelled among the Senoi before the Second World War wrote about the Senoi in his 1948 doctoral thesis and his 1954 popular book \"Pygmies and Dream Giants\". This work was publicised by parapsychologist Charles Tart and pedagogue George Leonard in books and at the Esalen Institute retreat center, and in the 1970s Patricia Garfield describes use of dreams among Senoi, based on her contact with some Senoi at the aborigine hospital in Gombak, Malaysia in 1972.\n\nLater researchers were unable to substantiate Stewart's account and in 1985 G. William Domhoff argued that the anthropologists who have worked with the Temiar people report that although they are familiar with the concept of lucid dreaming, it is not of great importance to them, but others have argued that Domhoff's criticism is exaggerated.\nDomhoff does not dispute the evidence that dream control is possible, and that dream-control techniques can be beneficial in specific conditions such as the treatment of nightmares: he cites the work of the psychiatrists Bernard Kraków and Isaac Marks in this regard. He does, however, dispute some of the claims of the DreamWorks movement, and also the evidence that dream discussion groups, as opposed to individual motivation and ability, make a significant difference in being able to dream lucidly, and to be able to do so consistently.\n\n\n"}

The SSG allows Member countries to impose additional tariffs on agricultural products if their import volume exceeds defined trigger levels, or if prices fall below specified trigger levels. Its purpose is to prevent disruption of domestic markets due to import surges or abnormally low import prices. The SSG applies only to products that are (1) subject to tarrification and (2) in cases where the country has designated a productas eligible for the SSG in its Schedule of Commitments. It can apply only to imports that exceed tariff-rate quota volumes. The SSG is an alternative to the general safeguard provision of the GATT and is easier to invoke because it does not require a test of injury or threat of injury.

{"id": "887196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=887196", "title": "Star Academy (Arabia)", "text": "Star Academy (Arabia)\n\nStar Academy Arab World, also known as Star Academy: \"Al-Academya\" () or Star Academy Arabia, is a pan-Arab televised talent show, which aired in 2003. The show features a group of young male and female candidates who are selected from a pan-Arab pool of more than three-thousand and are sequestered for four months in \"The Academy,\" a four-story building in Lebanon, where they live, train, and compete against one another every week. The show became an instant success and an everyday much-watched event across the Arab World.\n\nThe show was adapted from a French show of the same name and is produced by Dutch company Endemol, Vanilla Productions & PAC Ltd. Star Academy Arab World is based on the Spanish format called Operación Triunfo.\n\nThe show centers around the 16 candidates who compete in weekly talent competitions, singing, dancing, and acting during on-stage performances. At the end of every week, one contestant is kicked off by a public vote by the viewers.\n\nOne of the show's highlights are the appearances of some of the Arab World's most important performers such as Najwa Karam, Diana Haddad, Haifa Wahbe, Elissa, Angham, Asalah, Ramy Ayach, Myriam Fares, Kazem Al Saher, Nawal Al-Zoghbi, Marwan Khoury, Carole Samaha, Ehab Tawfik, Wael Kfoury, Sherine, Fares Karam, Abdallah Al Rowaished, Saad Lamjarred and many more. The show has also been successful for its reinvention and continuous changes, just as, starting from the third season, the show witnessed guests from international superstars such as Julio Iglesias, Anggun, Karl Wolf, Tina Arena, Chris De Burgh and Massari.\n\nOn February 10, 2014, LBCI CBC & Endemol Middle East announced that Star Academy will renew another season. The casting started and will be held in Amman, Beirut, Erbil, Dubai, Cairo, Alexandria, Casablanca, Marrakech, Tunis, and Sousse.\n\nBased in Adma, a city north of Beirut, Lebanon, the show is aired for 4 months on the Egyptian TV station CBC and on the Lebanese terrestrial channel LBC and is hosted by Hilda Khalife. The show follows 16 candidates through their weeks living in \"The Academy,\" training with \"teachers,\" and performing their talents in live on-stage shows. While many choose to sing, talents are not restricted to vocal performances; acting and dancing are also common talents.\n\nThe show takes on a few different formats depending on the day of the week. Every day, there is a one-hour \"access\" show that goes over the day's important and exciting events. On Friday, there is a live performance show where the candidates compete against each other, sometimes alongside famous domestic and international stars, and are voted off one by one. In addition, viewers can tune into \"The Academy\" 24/7 by watching LBC Reality, a dedicated satellite station.\n\nThe concept of the show is training the students in several disciplines: singing, acting, sports, vocalizing, theatre expression, dancing, and musical culture. Then, each Monday, the three weakest students are nominated. The nomination is done by the teaching staff after the candidates undergo an evaluation test the day before Sunday. On Friday, a special live show called \"Prime\" is broadcast. During the prime show, the candidates perform and sing either by themselves or with guest artists. The three nominated candidates' initial voting is through the public, done by either phone calls or text messages. The one with the highest percentage of votes returns. The two remaining candidates are then voted on by their fellow candidates, and the one with the most votes remains. The other candidate has to leave the academy immediately. When the overall number of candidates is reduced, the nomination by the professors comes down to two students. At this point, it's completely up to the public to vote who is in and who is out, as the remaining candidates do not vote.\n\nThe show proved to be immensely popular. As the CBC station also provides satellite connections to more than two dozen Arab countries and to Egyptian and/or Arab communities throughout the world, it became one of the most popular shows in the Arab-speaking world. In Saudi Arabia in particular, \"Star Academy\" was a media event so popular that its broadcasts achieved record ratings, emptied streets in major cities like Jedda, animated debates, inspired Mosque sermons, and widely distracted students from focusing on final exams in May 2004. (Al-Humaydan, 2005) CBC And LBCI, the networks airing the show, reaped huge profits from the show but have been unable to replicate the show's success with other reality shows.\n\nThis debate also caused the indefinite postponing of West Asian edition of \"Big Brother\", also known as \"Big Brother – Al Raiss\".\n\nWhile the show is immensely popular among viewers, especially in Saudi Arabia, many conservative and religious leaders have criticized the show for promoting anti-Islamic behavior and ideals. \"Star Academy\" has sparked intense debates over the role of Islam in public life, Western cultural influence, gender relations, and political participation and has subverted Wahhabi notions of social order. In response to countless questions from religious Saudi viewers who questioned whether or not it was religiously haram (prohibited) or halal (permitted) to watch the show and participate in the voting component of \"Star Academy\", the Permanent Committee for Scientific Research and the Issuing of Fatwas issued a related fatwa (religious ruling) that prohibited watching, discussing, voting in, or participating in \"Star Academy\", as well as urging businessmen not to finance this or any similar show.\n\nAccording to the Committee, the fatwa was issued because the show carried a number of serious issues including \"free mixing of the sexes,\" \"the wanton display and unveiling on the part of the women displaying their charms,\" and blatant promotion of immorality by \"making Muslims get used to seeing these shameful scenes that provoke desires and by distancing them from good morals and virtues.\" The Committee also declared that simply not watching the show was not sufficient; it is also the duty of all practicing Muslims to advise those who watch or take part in the show that it is against religious law.\n\nMany individuals have also spoken out against the show, citing religious reasoning as well. An Imam as Mecca’s Great Mosque called \"Star Academy\" a \"weapon of mass destruction.\" Sahwi activists distributed a series of audiocassette sermons entitled \"Satan Academy\" while still others created similar sermons that compared the reality show to the virulent virus that had caused severe respiratory syndrome in the population. Religious leaders were not the only one to speak out against the show, though. Al-Riyah published a number of hostile op-eds entitled \"Star Academy: A Corrupt Satellite Industry\" and \"Star Academy… The Other Terrorism\" that harshly criticized the show.\n\nWhile there was much criticism of the show by the area’s more conservative members of society, many liberals praised the novel approach to television media. Numerous reporters in Saudi newspapers praised \"Star Academy\" as an alternative to the extremist dogma that had taken over mass media in the nation. In their view, the show acted as an invitation to dialogue as well as an inspiring lesson in democracy. In a column entitled \"Star Academy’s Democracy\" a female Saudi journalist wrote that \"Arabs sheid away from voting because …[of fraud]… until satellite television… corrupted us by inciting us to vote: \"vote you are the referee\"…\"nominate your favorite candidate\"…the Arab viewer has become obsessed with voting because results resemble election results in the United States, where unlike Arab elected, no body wins by 99.9 percent but rather by logical proportions.\" \n\nOther liberals were exasperated by the conservatives’ excessive reaction to Star Academy. Another female journalist writing for Arab news asked \"how vulnerable must we be if a TV program can ‘destroy our moral standards and teach our children bad things.\" \n\nA major liberal voice hailed from within the royal family when Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, a major stakeholder in LBC, supported \"Star Academy\" by sending his private plane to Beirut to bring the winner back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nOn February 14, 2005, Rula Sa'd, the Director of Marketing and Promotions at the LBC acted in her role as \"Director of the Academy\" to announce to the contestants that Rafiq al-Hariri had been assassinated and that Lebanon was in mourning. This was one of the only instances in the show's history that a real-life event had intruded upon The Academy. Like other Lebanese channels, LBC suspended its regular programing to focus all attention on the aftermath of the assassination, including a ten-day hiatus of \"Star Academy\". The show resumed on Friday, February 25 with an episode that critics deemed \"The Patriotic Night\" during which the contestants, along with Arab celebrities and contestants from past seasons came together and sung a number of patriotic songs in solidarity with the mourning nation. Not once throughout the program was al-Hariri's name said; instead, the show was made to be a demonstration of renewed patriotism.\n\nMajor controversy began when it came time to vote off that week's losing contestant. That week, the three nominees for expulsion included a Bahraini man Ahmad Salaheddin, a Syrian woman Joey Bassous, and a Lebanese man, Samer Doumit. Per contest rules, the public votes to save one contestant, and the remaining two are voted for by the other non nominated contestants. The Bahraini man was rescued by the public, but the Syrian women, despite getting higher ratings than Doumit by the public, was ultimately voted off the show.\n\nThe ousting was said to echo the tension that already existed between Syria and Lebanon post-assassination, as there was widespread suspicion that the Syrians were implicated in the crime.\n\nThe winners for the various series were:\n\n\nThe first season of Star Academy 1 made its debut in early December 2003. The first season ended on 4 April 2004. The winner was the Egyptian candidate, Mohammad Attia.\n\nThe inaugural show quickly became popular and tickets for the show became harder to get as the show went on. The students, particularly the Top 8, became household names, and those that made the Top 8 became instant stars. The eight finalists were Mohammad Attia (Egypt), Bashar Al Shatty (Kuwait), Sophia El Mareekh (Morocco), Bahaa' El Kafy (Tunisia), Ahmed El Sherif (Tunisia), Myriam Attallah (Syria), Mohammad Khalawi (Saudi Arabia) and Cynthia Karam (Lebanon). The teachers were as follows: Wadih Abi Raad, Michael Fadel, Mary Mahfouth, Betty Taoutel, Aida Sabra, Elissar Karakalla and Rola Saad.\nAt the end of the show, an album featuring the Top 8 was released, as well as a music video for the winner. They then went on a Pan Arab tour, performing concerts in Dubai, Kuwait, Cairo, Alexandria, Amman, Damascus, and Beirut.\n\nMany of them released albums, ranging in various degrees of success. Bashar Al Shatty (Kuwait) has gained much success in his three albums which he released over the last five years. Also being crowned as the most successful teenage singer in the Persian Gulf region was added to his success of being the \"Star Academy\" finalist. However, the most successful was Ahmed El Sherif (Tunisia), despite coming in the 5th place. His album has been the most successful among all student from \"Star Academy\" thus far, and has also dwarfed the albums of any of the contestants from rival show \"SuperStar\" on Future TV.\n\n\nThe candidate that took the 9th place, Bruno Tabbal, participated in the \"World Best\" contest that englobed about 11 countries that have this reality show in their country. He took the 10th place, and the French person, Elodie Frégé, won.\n\nPrimes\n\nTour\n\nMohamad A, Bashar, Bahaa, Ahmad, Mohamad K, Sophia, Cynthia, and Myriam (the Top 8) were chosen to be part of the tour.\n\nHisham, from Saudi Arabia, was declared as the winner this year, even though he was not the critic's favorite. He is also the winner with the most nominations in the show's history, with a record 4 nominations. Most felt that Amani or Zizi were the better performers overall. Many also felt that this year was a step-down in the quality of students from the previous year, with only Amani, Zizi, and Ahmed being deemed good singers.\n\nPrimes\nTour\n\nHisham, Amani, Zizi, Ahmad H, Bashar G, Katia, Samer, and Salma (once again, the Top 8) were chosen to be part of the tour.\n\nJoseph Attieh, who is a radio and TV production student received a trophy, $50,000 in cash and a brand new 2006 car. He was 19 years old and the first Lebanese to win the Title. This year was seen as an improvement over the previous year, and a return to the level of the first season, with many talented students. Some like Hani, Hanaa, and Shayma were deemed just as worthy of winning as Joseph. There were also many other strong performers like Fadi, Khalifa, Rakiya, Maya, and Wajdi.\n\nThis year, the show expanded the number of students from 16 contestants, in the two previous years, to 19 students.\n\nPrimes\n\nTour\n\nJoseph, Hani, Hanaa, Chayma, Fady, Khalifa, Maya, Rakiya and Wajdi were chosen to be part of the tour. This was the first year 9 students instead of 8 went on tour. It was also the first time where the Top finishing students did not all go on tour. Despite finishing 8th and 9th, Rym and Mohammed I were not chosen for the tour, Rakiya and Wajdi were selected to go on tour instead.\n\nShada Hassoun, from Iraq and Morocco, made history by being the first girl to take the title.\n\nThe fourth season (2007) was also the first season where two girls claimed the first and second place when Shada Hassoun came in first, and Marwa (from Tunisia) came in second. It was also noteworthy to feature the first female contestant from the Persian Gulf, Shoroq (from Bahrain), as well as the first contestant from Oman, Ayoub.\nPrimes\n\nTour\n\nShada, Marwa, Mohamed, Carlo, Sally, Ali, Tina, Ahmad, and Imed were chosen to be part of the tour. Once again, 9 students were chosen for the tour. even though Amel was placed ahead of Imed, he was chosen to go on tour instead of her.\n\nThe fifth season of Star Academy began on 25 January 2008. There were several changes in the academy that included a new swimming pool, a basketball court, a trampoline, a pool and tennis table and a newly decorated building. New lessons were added this season including swimming lessons, basketball lessons and music lessons. Another change was the increase in the number of students, from 19 in the previous season to now 20.\n\nThe final prime of Star Academy 5 held on 23 May 2008, witnessed the crowning of Nader Guirat, the first winner from Tunis and the Maghreb region.\n\nHis victory was somewhat controversial, as Nader Guirat was the first winner of the program to sing primarily in non-Arabic languages (English, French, etc.). Even though he did sing in Arabic on rare occasions, many felt that his Arabic singing was nowhere near up to the standards of the other contestants, and not worthy of a variety show that is primarily in Arabic. Nader is also the first winner to be a nominee without being saved by the public, as he had received a low percentage of votes.\n\nPrimes\n\nTour\n\nNader, Mohamad, Saad, Shahinaz, Mirhan, Diaa and Amel B were chosen to be part of the tour. This was the first time only 7 students had been chosen for the tour (previous years had 8 or 9 students). However, for unknown reasons, the tour was cancelled.\n\nThe winner of Star Academy 6 made history by being the first contestant from a country that already had a student win from it. Abdulaziz Abdulrahman from Saudi Arabia became the second Saudi Arabian, after Hisham Abdulrahman from season 2, to win the title.\n\nStar Academy 6 has undergone some major changes, the studio was enlarged and the Academy itself went through an extreme makeover and now includes a theater for movies, a spa, and a DJ Studio.\n\nPrimes\n\nTour\n\nAbdulaziz, Bassma, Ibrahim, Michel A, Lara, Mohamed B, Tania, Yehya and Nasser were chosen to be part of the tour. Once again, unlike the previous season, the tour chose to have 9 students to participate. But once again, for unknown reasons, the tour was canceled.\n\nStar Academy 7 launched its first prime from Adma, Lebanon on the 19 February 2010 on LBC.\n\nThis year's winner was Nassif Zaytoun from Syria. He made history by being the first contestant from Syria to win.\n\nPrimes\nTour\n\nNassif, Rahma, Mohamed R, Ramy, Badreia, Sultan, Asma, Tahra, Mahmoud, Zeina, Abdulaziz, Miral and Rayan were chosen to be part of the tour, but following the shocking and unexpected death of Ramy, the tour was cancelled.\n\nNesma Alaa Ali Mahgoub, a 20-year-old student from Egypt, was the winner this year. She is the second Egyptian to win in the show, after Mohamed Atieh, the second female contestant to win, after Shada Hassoun, and also the second candidate to win in the Arab show by singing mostly the western genre, after Nader Guirat.\n\nStar Academy Arabia returned with a brand new name after a hiatus of over a year. The series began on September 26, 2013 and ended on January 9th 2014, and was produced by Endemol Middle East. It aired on three channels including LBCI and CBC Egypt.\nThe contestants of this series were, in order of elimination: \n1. Menna Hany\n2. Marita Abi Nader\n3. Issa Almarzoug\n4. Taher Mostafa\n5. Mayssa Mejri\n6. Maria Sarkis\n7. Nour Farawati\n8. Lilia Ben Chikha\n9. Zaki Chreif\n10. Mosab Al Khateeb\n11. Abdallah Abd Al Aziz\n12. Rana Samaha\n13. Soukaina Boukries\n14. Jean Chahid\n15. Zinab Oussama\n16. Mahmoud Mohey (Winner)\n\nThe winner of Star Academy 10 made history by being the first contestant from a country that already had a student win from it. Mohammed Chahin from Egypt became the 4th Egyptian to win the title, and the 3rd consecutive one after Mahmoud Mohey in Season 9 and Nesma Mahgoub In Season 8 .\n\nPrimes\n\nStar Academy 11 began in October 2015 and ended in January 2016 with the crowning of this season's winner Marwan Youssef from Lebanon. Marwan is the second Lebanese contestant to win the first place title after Joseph Attieh (Star Academy 3). The season was produced by Endemol Shine Middle East and broadcast on Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International aka LBC Lebanon) and Capital Broadcasting Center aka CBC (Egypt) tv networks. Among many other prizes awarded to the winner of the season, Marwan Youssef won a song produced by Endemol, and released his first single \"Watan Hobi.\" Marwan later went on to release a second single alone with Watary Productions record label titled \"Rafed Saddek,\" which saw great success and lead to him filming his first music video for the song. Marwan has since performed many concerts and performed in important music festivals. \n\nMarwan Youssef winner of star academy 11\n\nFinalist Contestants:\n-Star Academy 1:\n.Mohamed Atteya (Egypt); Winner.\n.Bashar Shatii (Kuwait).\n-Star Academy 2:\n.Hisham Abdulrahman (KSA); Winner.\n.Amani Swisy (Tunisia).\n-Star Academy 3:\n.Joseph Atteya (Lebanon); Winner.\n.Hani Hussein (Egypt).\n.Han'a Idrissy (Morocco).\n-Star Academy 4:\n.Shatha Hassoun (Iraq); First Female Winner.\n.Marwa Bin Sughaiyer (Tunisia).\n.Mohamed Kammah (Egypt).\n.Carlo Nakhla (Lebanon).\n-Star Academy 5:\n.Nader Guirat (Tunisia); Winner.\n.Mohamed Qwidar (Jordan).\n.Sa'ad Ramadan (Lebanon).\n-Star Academy 6:\n.Abdulaziz Abdelrahman (KSA); Second Winner from KSA .\n.Bassma Bousail (Morocco).\n.Ibrahim Dashti (Kuwait).\n.Michel Azzi (Lebanon).\n-Star Academy 7:\n.Nassif Zeytoun (Syria); Winner.\n.Rahma Mezher (Iraq)\n.Mohamed Ramadan (Jordan).\n-Star Academy 8:\n.Nesma Mahgoub (Egypt); Second Winner from Egypt & Second Female Winner.\n.Ahmed Ezzat (Egypt); \n.Sarah Farah (Syria);\n-Star Academy 9:\n.Mahmoud Mohey (Egypt); Third Winner from Egypt\n.Zinab Oussama (Morocco)\n.Jean Chahid (Lebanon)\n-Star Academy 10:\n.Mohammad Chahine (Egypt); Fourth Winner from Egypt\n.

{"id": "723830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=723830", "title": "Sudanese Arabic", "text": "Sudanese Arabic\n\nSudanese Arabic is the variety of Arabic spoken throughout Sudan and in parts of Eritrea. Some of the tribes in Sudan still have similar accents to the ones in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn 1889 the \"Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute\" of Great Britain claimed that the Arabic spoken in Sudan was \"a pure but archaic Arabic\". The pronunciation of certain letters was like Hijazi, and not Egyptian, such as g being the pronunciation for the Arabic letter Qāf and J being the pronunciation for Jim.\n\nSudanese Arabic is similar to Egyptian Arabic. While it does not share some of the characteristic properties of northern Egyptian dialects (like that of Cairo), Sudanese Arabic is particularly close to central and southern Egyptian or Sa'idi Arabic. It is also closely related to Hejazi Arabic.\n\nThe Arabic letter ج maintains an archaic pronunciation in Sudanese (other dialects typically have , or , while Cairene Arabic has ).\n\nSudanese Arabic also maintains an archaic rendering of qaf as (Voiced uvular plosive) while Cairene Arabic (like some other modern Urban dialects) renders it as . The uvular rendering of qaf has been lost in most other Arabic dialects and is also considered a relic.\n\nAlso peculiar to Sudanese is the quality of the Arabic vowel transliterated as \"u/ū\"; this is usually transliterated as \"o\" in materials on Sudanese because the sound ranges from ~ rather than the typical ~.\n\nIn addition to differences in pronunciation, Sudanese Arabic also uses some different words when compared to Egyptian Arabic. For example, the interrogative pronoun \"what\" in Sudan is \"shinu\" rather than \"eh\" as in Egyptian Arabic.\n\nIn northern and central parts of Sudan, Sudanese colloquial Arabic has been influenced by the Nubian language, which in ancient times was the dominant language in Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan. Many of the agricultural and farming terms in Sudanese Arabic were adopted from Nubian.\n\n\nBecause of the varying influence of local languages in different parts of Sudan, there is considerable regional variation in Arabic spoken throughout the country. Sudanese Arabic typically refers to Arabic spoken mostly in central parts of Sudan. The other most commonly mentioned derivative of Sudanese Arabic is Juba Arabic, a pidgin of Arabic spoken in South Sudan, which is much more heavily influenced by other local languages.\n\nIn northern Sudan, greetings are typically extended, and involve multiple questions about the other person's health, their family etc. When greeting someone you know informally, it is common to begin with the word \"o\", followed by the person's first name: \"Ō, Khalafalla\" or \"Ō, kēf ya Khalafalla\".\n\nFormal greetings often begin with the universal \"As-salām ˤalaykom\" and the reply, \"Wa ˤalaykom as-salām\", an exchange common to Muslims everywhere. However, other greetings typical to Sudan include \"Izzēyak\" (to men) or \" Izzēyik\" (to women). A rather informal way to say \"How are you\", is \"Inta shadīd? Inti shadīda?\" \"Are you well? (to a male and a female, respectively)\", the response to which is usually \"al-Hamdo lillāh\" \"Praise God\" assuming you are indeed feeling well, \"ma batal\" \"not bad\" or \"nosnos\" \"half-half)\" if feeling only okay or \"taˤban showayya\" \"a little tired\" if not so well. Of course, there can be many other responses but these are used in everyday language.\n\nOther everyday greetings include \"kwayyis(a), alhamdulilah\" \"Good, thanks to allah\", \"Kēf al-usra?\" \"how is the family?\" or \"kēf al awlād?\" \"how are the children\". For friends, the question \"Kēf?\" can also be formed using the person's first name, prefixed by \"ya\", for example; \"kēf ya Yōsif?\" \"How are you, Joseph?\". Another standard response in addition to \"al-hamdu lillāh\" is \"Allāh ybarik fik\" \"God's blessing upon you\". Additional greetings are appropriate for particular times and are standard in most varieties of Arabic, such as \"Sabāh al-khēr? / Sabāh an-Nōr\".\n\nSudanese that know each other well will often use many of these greetings together, sometimes repeating themselves. It is also common to shake hands on first meeting, sometimes simultaneously slapping or tapping each other on the left shoulder before the handshake (particularly for good friends). Handshakes in Sudan can often last as long as greetings. A handshake between well-acquainted Sudanese will often be preceded by raising one's right hand and touching each other's left shoulder simultaneously before engaging in the handshake, all while exchanging verbal greetings.\n\nThe Sudanese Arabic word for \"yes\" depends on the tribe; \"aye\" is widely used, similar to the Scottish aye, although \"aywa\" or \"na‘am\" are also commonly used.\n\nIn 1927 the Gospel of Mark was published in Roman script ins Sudanese Arabic by the British and Foreign Bible Society. The Gospel of Luke was printed in 1955 and the Gospel of John in 1964, both in Arabic script. The whole New Testament was published in Sudanese Arabic in Roman script in 1978. It was translated by Translated by Barbara Harper and Evelyn Stewart of the Bible Alliance Mission. It included an introduction, section headings, footnotes, note on alphabet and glossary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22036265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22036265", "title": "Tax protester", "text": "Tax protester\n\nA tax protester is someone who refuses to pay a tax claiming that the tax laws are unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. Tax protesters are different from tax resisters, who refuse to pay taxes as a protest against a government or its policies, or a moral opposition to taxation in general, not out of a belief that the tax law itself is invalid. The United States has a large and organized culture of people who espouse such theories. Tax protesters also exist in other countries.\n\nLegal commentator Daniel B. Evans has defined tax protesters as people who \"refuse to pay taxes or file tax returns out of a mistaken belief that the federal income tax is unconstitutional, invalid, voluntary, or otherwise does not apply to them under one of a number of bizarre arguments.\" (divided into several classes: constitutional, conspiracy, administrative, statutory, and arguments based on 16th Amendment and the \"861\" section of the tax code. An overview can be found here) Law Professor Allen D. Madison has described tax protesters as \"those who refuse to pay income tax on the basis of some nonsensical legal argument that he or she does not owe tax.\"\n\nAn illegal tax-protest scheme has been defined as \"any scheme, without basis in law or fact, designed to express dissatisfaction with the tax laws by interfering with their administration or attempting to illegally avoid or reduce tax liabilities.\" The United States Tax Court has stated that \"tax protester\" is a designation \"often given to persons who make frivolous antitax arguments\".\n\nTax protesters raise a number of different kinds of arguments. In the United States, these typically include constitutional arguments, such as claims that the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution was not properly ratified or that it is unconstitutional generally, or that being forced to file an income tax return violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Others are statutory arguments suggesting that the income tax is constitutional but the statutes enacting the income tax are ineffective, or that Federal Reserve Notes or other relevant currencies do not constitute cash or income. Yet another collection of arguments centers on general conspiracies involving numerous government agencies.\n\nSome tax protesters refuse to file a tax return or file returns with no income or tax data supplied.\n\nIn the United States, the term \"protest\" as applied to a tax generally means \"a declaration by a payer, esp. of a tax, that he does not concede the legality of a claim he is paying\". Similarly, \"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines a tax protest as:\n\nAt common law, and under some earlier tax statutes, the filing of a protest at the time of payment of an erroneous tax was a requirement in order for the payor to recover a refund of the tax at a later time. In the case of U.S. federal taxes, the rule was abolished by Congress in 1924. Under the current Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the taxpayer's failure to protest does not deprive the taxpayer of the right to file an administrative claim with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for a refund and, if the claim is not allowed by the IRS, to sue for a tax refund in Federal district court.\n\nThe term \"protest\" is also used to describe a taxpayer's formal written request for review, by the Appeals Division of the IRS, after the IRS issues a \"Thirty-Day Letter\" proposing an increased tax liability following an IRS examination of a tax return.\n\nIn 1972, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania used the term tax \"protestor\" (protester) in \"United States v. Malinowski\". This case, however, involved a taxpayer who was a member of the Philadelphia War Tax Resistance League who was protesting the use of tax money in the Vietnam War. The taxpayer was not making arguments that the tax law itself was invalid; he was essentially protesting the war, not the tax. The taxpayer had filed a false Form W-4, and admitted he knew that he was not legally entitled to claim the exemptions (allowances) he claimed on the W-4. Thus, Malinowski might be termed a tax resister rather than a tax protester. He was convicted, and his motion for a new trial or acquittal was denied.\n\nA person could be both a tax protester \"and\" a tax resister if he or she believes that tax laws do not apply to him or her and \"also\" believes that taxes should not be paid based on the use to which the taxes are put. Some tax resisters have put forth legal arguments for their position—for instance that they cannot pay taxes for nuclear weapons development because this would put them in violation of the Nuremberg Principles—that could be considered varieties of tax-protester theories.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, U.S. Federal courts began using the term \"tax protester\" in still another, more narrow sense—to describe persons who raised frivolous arguments about the legality of Federal taxes, particularly income taxes. This particular technical sense of the term is the sense described in the remainder of this article.\n\nWhile there have been people throughout history who challenged the assessment of taxes as beyond the power of the government, the modern tax-protester movement began after World War II. One of the first people to fit this description was Vivien Kellems, a Connecticut industrialist and political activist who specifically protested monthly tax withholding. In 1948 she refused to withhold taxes from the wages of her employees, based on the claim that the government had no power to require such withholding. The IRS then seized the money owed from her bank account. She brought suit against them and, in a book she wrote, asserted that she won, although she did not challenge the constitutionality of tax withholding itself.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals stated that people are attracted to the \"tax protestor movement's illusory claim that there is no legal requirement to pay federal income tax.\" The court called the tax-protester arguments \"wholly defective and unsuccessful.\" Ideas associated with the tax-protester movement have been forwarded under different names over time. These ideas have been put forth, for example, in the broader Christian Patriot and Posse Comitatus movements, which generally assert that the Constitution has been usurped by the federal government.\n\nThe tax-protester phenomenon is not restricted to the United States. Similar arguments are raised in the context of other legal systems in other countries, although it is more notorious in the United States tax system. It has been noted that tax protester theories originating in the United States, such as denying the authority of courts, have spread into Canada. As with cases in the United States, the courts have uniformly found these arguments to be invalid, and often incoherent.\n\nIn 1986, the Seventh Circuit observed:\n\nArguments made by tax protesters in the United States generally fall into several categories: that the Sixteenth Amendment was never properly ratified; that the Sixteenth Amendment does not permit the taxation of individual income, or particular forms of individual income; that other provisions of the Constitution such as the First, Fifth, or a \"Missing Thirteenth Amendment\" eliminate an obligation to file a return; that citizens of the states are not also citizens of the United States; that the statutes enacted by the United States Congress pursuant to their constitutional taxing power are defective or invalid; that the tax code does not apply to inhabitants of U.S. territories; and that the government and the courts engage in various conspiracies to conceal the above deficiencies. Outside of the United States, tax protesters raise similar conspiracy arguments, claims that they are not \"citizens\" under the jurisdiction of the court where the claim is brought, and claims about the validity of statutes imposing taxation.\n\nSuch arguments are usually summarily dispensed with when presented in the courts. For example, the Fifth Circuit once noted:\n\nIn that case, the court viewed the tax-protester arguments as sufficiently frivolous to merit the imposition of sanctions—in this case twice the costs spent by the government in defending the litigation—for even bringing them up. Similarly, a Canadian Tax Court judge found claims asserted by a \"tax denier\" in that court to be \"an absurd blend of the ridiculous arguments... unintelligible, incomprehensible, meaningless, irrelevant and factually hopeless\".\n\nIn the United States, protesting Federal income taxes is not, in and of itself, a criminal offense. However, a number of offenses arise from failing to pay taxes that are due, and from repeating arguments that have previously been invalidated by the courts.\n\nThe United States Congress has, however, enacted Internal Revenue Code section 6702 \"in an effort to deter tax protesters from filing frivolous returns.\" This statute was enacted as part of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982.\n\nThe penalty under section 6702 is a civil (non-criminal) penalty, and is $500 for positions taken on or before March 15, 2007. For positions taken after that date, the penalty amount has been increased to $5,000. The Internal Revenue Service has issued a list of positions considered to be legally frivolous. Shauna Henline, Senior Technical Coordinator of the Frivolous Return Program at the Internal Revenue Service, has testified that the IRS receives about 20,000 to 30,000 frivolous tax returns per year, and that approximately 100,000 related letters and other documents are received each year.\n\nIn some cases, taxpayers have argued that section 6702, the \"frivolous argument\" penalty statute, is itself unconstitutional. That argument was rejected in \"Hazewinkel v. United States\" (taxpayer's arguments—that sections 6702 and 6703 violate both procedural and substantive due process because there is no right to a prior hearing, and that the word \"frivolous\" is unconstitutionally vague—were rejected). See also \"Pillsbury v. Commissioner\", a case in which taxpayer Leecil Pillsbury's argument—that section 6702 violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause of the Constitution—was ruled to be without merit.\n\nIn that case, the court also ruled the following taxpayer arguments to be invalid: (1) the argument that section 6702 is an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder; (2) the argument that section 6702 unconstitutionally authorizes the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment; (3) the argument that section 6702 unconstitutionally violates the doctrine of separation of powers; and (4) the argument that section 6702 unconstitutionally violates the taxpayer's First Amendment rights to petition the government for redress of grievances. See also \"Duke v. Commissioner\" (tax-protester argument that 6702 was unconstitutional was rejected by the court), \"Kane v. United States\" (taxpayer's argument—that because section 6702 does not define the term \"frivolous,\" the statute is unconstitutionally vague—was rejected), and \"Hudson v. United States\" (taxpayer's arguments—that section 6702 unconstitutionally violates taxpayer's First Amendment rights, that section 6702 violates due process rights by failing to provide a hearing before assessment of a penalty, that section 6702 is an unconstitutional bill of attainder, and that section 6702 is unconstitutionally vague—were ruled to be without merit).\n\nIn 1939, Congress enacted section 1117(g) (entitled \"Proceeding Frivolous\") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, giving the Board of Tax Appeals (now called the United States Tax Court) the power to impose a civil monetary penalty of up to $500 against any party who instituted a proceeding \"merely for delay\" before the Board of Tax Appeals. In 1954, this provision was continued with the enactment of section 6673 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The current version of section 6673 (in the 1986 Code) provides that frivolous arguments may result in a penalty in U.S. Tax Court of up to $25,000. Similarly, the Internal Revenue Code also provides that the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal courts of appeals may impose penalties where the taxpayer's appeal of a U.S. Tax Court decision was \"maintained primarily for delay\" or where \"the taxpayer's position in the appeal is frivolous or groundless.\"\n\nIn a non-criminal case in a United States district court, a litigant (or a litigant's attorney) who presents any pleading, written motion or other paper to the court is deemed to have certified that, to the best of the presenter's knowledge and belief, the legal contentions \"are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law\". Monetary civil penalties for violation of this rule may in some cases be imposed on the litigant or the attorney under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nCongress has enacted section 1912 of title 28 of the United States Code providing that in the United States Supreme Court and in the various courts of appeals where litigation by the losing party has caused damage to the prevailing party, the court may impose a requirement that the losing party pay the prevailing party for those damages. A person who raises a frivolous argument in a Federal appeals court may also be subject to monetary penalties under Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. In one 2007 case, for example, the Seventh Circuit issued an order giving such an attorney \"14 days to show cause why he should not be fined $10,000 for his frivolous arguments\", based in part on Rule 38.\n\nThe \"Guiding Light of God Ministries,\" a tax protester group organized by Eddie Ray Kahn, filed about 2,000 official misconduct complaints against employees of the IRS. Some tax agents reported that these complaints had influenced their supervisors to order them to back off from audits and collection efforts against members of the group.\n\nPrior to the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (the \"1998 Act\"), the Internal Revenue Service had defined a tax-protester scheme as \"any scheme without basis in law or fact for the ostensible purpose of expressing dissatisfaction with the substance, form, or administration of the tax laws be [\"sic\"; \"by\"] either interfering with tax administration or attempting to illegally avoid or reduce tax liabilities.\"\n\nThe IRS has not released records indicating whom the agency defined as \"illegal tax protesters\" (coded as TC-148). In testimony before Congress in 1997, former IRS historian Shelley L. Davis contended that the IRS kept lists of citizens \"for no reason other than that their political activities might have offended someone at the IRS [….]\" and she charged that \"anyone who offers even legitimate criticism of the tax collector is [labeled by the IRS as] a tax protester […]\"\n\nAfter the 1997 congressional hearings, Congress responded with the 1998 Act. Subsection (a) of section 3707 of the 1998 Act now prohibits \"officers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service\" from designating a taxpayer as an \"illegal tax protester\" or using any similar designation for a taxpayer. By contrast, subsection (b) of section 3707 provides: \"An officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service may designate any appropriate taxpayer as a nonfiler, but shall remove such designation once the taxpayer has filed income tax returns for 2 consecutive taxable years and paid all taxes shown on such returns.\"\n\nThe IRS has prescribed procedures for its personnel to handle frivolous returns (whether considered valid returns or not) in the \"Frivolous Return Program\" section of the Internal Revenue Manual. The IRS has concluded, in \"Service Center Advice 200107034\" dated November 15, 2000, that the statutory prohibition on the use of the term \"illegal tax protester\" by IRS personnel does not prohibit the IRS from maintaining a database of frivolous tax return filers as part of its \"Frivolous Return Program\". IRS Advice 200107034 states (in part):\n\nAccording to the IRS:\n\nThe Criminal Investigation (CI) division of the Internal Revenue Service investigates reports of violations of the federal criminal tax statutes, including tax evasion under , willful failure to file tax returns or pay tax under , willful filing of false returns under , and violations of other statutes, and refers tax cases to the Tax Division of the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecution.\n\nIn July 2008, the office of the Treasury Department's Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that the number of federal criminal tax investigations referred by the Internal Revenue Service to the Justice Department is at an eight-year high. According to the report, the fiscal year 2007 ended with 4,600 investigations. The increase is nearly 50 percent from fiscal year 2002 to year 2007. The report also concluded that federal criminal tax convictions increased by 6.7% from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year 2007. The number of persons convicted in fiscal year 2007 was 2,155.\n\nIn \"United States v. Amon\" in 1981, Alan Amon was convicted of filing a false withholding allowance certificate under . Rather than having been indicted by a grand jury, Amon had been charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in a document called an information. He appealed the conviction, in part on the ground that the government's prosecution of him was \"unconstitutionally selective.\" The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted that the trial court had agreed that Amon was \"selected for prosecution because he is an active and outspoken [tax] protester.\"\n\nThe trial court ruled that Amon's \"status as an active protester was insufficient to establish selective prosecution\" and that no illegal discrimination occurs where the government prosecutes individuals for actions they take in failing to comply with tax laws where an effect of the prosecution is \"...to dissuade others from engaging in that kind of tax protest.\" The Court of Appeals agreed, stating: \"Merely showing that the Government elected, under established IRS directives, to prosecute an individual because he was vocal in opposing voluntary compliance with the federal income tax law, without also establishing that others similarly situated were not prosecuted and that the prosecution was based on racial, religious or other impermissible considerations, does not demonstrate an unconstitutionally selective prosecution.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice may obtain a federal court ruling to the effect that a specific tax-protester activity constitutes the promotion of an illegal tax shelter under Internal Revenue Code section 6700 (), and may obtain a court order prohibiting that activity under , as it did in the case of \"United States v. Robert L. Schulz, We the People Foundation for Constitutional Education, Inc., and We the People Congress, Inc.\". The Tax Division of the U.S. Department of Justice prosecutes violations of the federal criminal tax statutes, generally after an investigation and referral of a case by the Criminal Investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service. See, e.g., subsection (d) of .\n\nAs of February 2008, the Department of Justice was reported to be \"planning a crackdown on the so-called tax-protester movement.\" United States Assistant Attorney General Nathan Hochman, the head of the Tax Division of the Justice Department, stated: \"Too many people succumb to the fallacy, the illusion, that you don't have to pay any tax under any set of conditions […] That is a growing problem.\" According to a \"Bloomberg News\" report, the U.S. government has a 97 percent conviction rate in criminal tax denier cases. On April 9, 2008, Hochman announced the launch of the National Tax Defier Initiative, also known as the \"TAXDEF Initiative.\"\n\nMany United States Courts of Appeals have made blanket statements repudiating tax-protester arguments. For example, see the Seventh Circuit case of \"United States v. Cheek\":\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States addressed tax-protester arguments in \"Cheek v. United States\". John L. Cheek, a tax protester, had been prosecuted for tax evasion under . In response to Mr. Cheek's arguments on appeal, the Court stated:\n\nClaims that some of the provisions of the tax code are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however wrong, that those provisions are invalid and unenforceable. Thus, in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require him to pay a tax.\n\nThe Court continued:\n\nWe do not believe that Congress contemplated that such a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, and, when he did, was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who \"willfully\" refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.\n\nAfter a remand by the Supreme Court, Mr. Cheek was ultimately convicted, and the conviction was upheld on appeal. The Supreme Court refused to hear Mr. Cheek's petition for review of his conviction after the remand, and he was sent to prison.\n\nIf a jury finds that a \"criminal\" defendant had a subjective good-faith belief due to a misunderstanding based on the complexity of the tax law (and not based on an argument about its constitutionality), that belief may be a defense with respect to the element of willfulness, even if the belief is unreasonable. This is due to the general \"mens rea\" requirement needed to hold someone criminally liable and the specific intent (required by the word \"willfully\" in the statute) as defined in \"Cheek\" and other cases (see specific intent crimes). Persons acquitted of criminal tax evasion may still be sued civilly, and may be required to pay the taxes assessed, along with civil penalties.\n\n\n"}

It refers to the interactions between, and politics of, technology and culture.\n\n\"Technoculture\" is used by a number of universities to describe subject areas or courses of study. UC Davis, for instance, has a program of technocultural studies. In 2012, the major merged with Film Studies to form Cinema and Techno-Cultural Studies (CaTS), but in 2013 is being reviewed to become Cinema and Technoculture (see below); the University of Western Ontario offers a degree in Media, Information and Technoculture (which they refer to as MIT, offering an \"MIT BA\"). UC Riverside is in the process of creating a program in technocultural studies beginning with the creation of a graduate certificate program in \"Science Fiction and Technoculture Studies.\"\n\nAccording to its description, the Georgetown University course English/CCT 691 titled \"Technoculture from Frankenstein to Cyberpunk\", covers the \"social reception and representation of technology in literature and popular culture from the Romantic era to the present\" and includes \"all media, including film, TV, and recent video animation and Web 'zines.\" The course focuses \"mainly on American culture and the way in which machines, computers, and the body have been imagined.\"\n\nThe UC Davis Technocultural Studies department focuses on \"transdisciplinary approaches to artistic, cultural and scholarly production in contemporary media and digital arts, community media, and mutual concerns of the arts with the scientific and technological disciplines. In contrast to programs which see technology as the primary driving force, we place questions of poetics, aesthetics, history, politics and the environment at the core of our mission. In other words, we emphasize the 'culture' in Technoculture.\"\n\nThe Technocultural Studies major program is an interdisciplinary integration of current research in cultural history and theory with innovative hands-on production in digital media and \"low-tech\". It focuses on the fine and performing arts, media arts, community media, literature and cultural studies as they relate to technology and science. Backed by critical perspectives and the latest forms of research and production skills, students enjoy the mobility to explore individual research and expression, project-based collaboration and community engagement.\n\nTechnocultural Studies is a fairly new major at UC Davis and is considered a division of Humanities, Arts and Cultural Studies.\n\n\n\"'Technoculture: An Online Journal of Technology in Society\" () is an independent, interdisciplinary, annual peer-reviewed journal that publishes critical and creative works that explore the ways in which technology impacts society. It uses a broad definition of technology. Founded by Keith Dorwick and Kevin Moberly, it is now edited by Keith Dorwick. \"Technoculture\" is a member of the Council of Editors of Learned Journals and is indexed by EBSCOhost and the Modern Language Association.\n\nMarshall McLuhan is most known for his concepts of a \"global village\". In his book \"Understanding Media\" he talks about how media affects society and culture. He also develops a theory about technology being an extension of the body. According to McLuhan, the alphabet is what gave rise to the idea that sight is more important than hearing because in order to communicate one had to be able to see and understand the alphabet.\n\nIn her book \"Technoculture: The Key Concepts\", Debra Benita Shaw \"outlines the place of science and technology in today's culture\" and \"explores the power of scientific ideas, their impact on how we understand the natural world and how successive technological developments have influenced our attitudes to work, art, space, language and the human body.\"\n\nClay Shirky writes, teaches, and consults on the social and economic effects of the internet, and especially on places where our social and technological networks overlap. He is on the faculty of NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, and has consulted for Nokia, Procter and Gamble, News Corp., the BBC, the United States Navy and Lego. He is also a regular speaker at technology conferences.\n\nIn his book \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" Walter Benjamin attempts to analyze the changed experience of art in modern society. He believes that a reproduction of art lacks presence in time and space and therefore has no aura. Original works of art do have an aura. An aura includes authority, its place in space and time (when it was made), how the piece's physical condition suffered and how it's changed owners over time. An original work of art derives its authenticity from history and what has happened to it over time.\n\n"}
{"id": "10456882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10456882", "title": "Technological fix", "text": "Technological fix\n\nA technological fix, technical fix, technological shortcut or solutionism refers to the attempt of using engineering or technology to solve a problem (often created by earlier technological interventions).\n\nSome references define technological fix as an \"attempt to repair the harm of a technology by modification of the system\", that might involve modification of the machine and/or modification of the procedures for operating and maintaining it.\n\nTechnological fixes are inevitable in modern technology. It has been observed that many technologies, although invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, often create other problems in the process, known as externalities. In other words, there would be modification of the basic hardware, modification of techniques and procedures, or both.\n\nTechnological fix is the idea that all problems can find solutions in better and new technologies. It now is used as a dismissive phrase to describe cheap, quick fixes by using inappropriate technologies; these fixes often create more problems than they solve, or give people a sense that they have solved the problem.\n\nIn the contemporary context, technological fix is sometimes used to refer to the idea of using data and intelligent algorithms to supplement and improve human decision making in hope that this would result in ameliorating the bigger problem. One critic, Evgeny Morozov defines this as \"Recasting all complex social situations either as neat problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimized--if only the right algorithms are in place.\" While some criticizes this approach to the issues of today as detrimental to efforts to truly solve these problems, opponents finds merits in such approach to technological improvement of our society as complements to existing activists and policy efforts.\n\nAn example of the criticism is how policy makers may be tempted to think that installing smart energy monitors would help people conserve energy better, thus improving global warming, rather than focusing on the arduous process of passing laws to tax carbon, etc. Another example is thinking of obesity as a lifestyle choice of eating high caloric foods and not exercising enough, rather than viewing obesity as more of a social and class problem where individuals are predisposed to eat certain kind of foods (due to the lack of affordable health-supporting food in urban food deserts), to lack optimally evidence-based health behaviors, and lack of proper health care to mitigate behavioral outcomes.\n\nThe technological fix for climate change is an example of the use of technology to restore the environment. This can be seen through various different strategies such as: geo-engineering and renewable energy.\n\nGeo-engineering is referred as \"the artificial modification of Earth's climate systems through two primary ideologies, Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)\". Different schemes, projects and technologies have been designed to tackle the effects of climate change, usually by removing CO2 from the air as seen by Klaus Lackner's invention of a Co2 prototype, or by limiting the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, by space mirrors. However, \"critics by contrast claim that geoengineering isn't realistic – and may be a distraction from reducing emissions.\" It has been argued that geo-engineering is an adaptation to global warming. It allows TNC's, humans and governments to avoid facing the facts that global warming is a crisis that needs to be dealt with head-on by reducing emissions and implementing green technologies, rather than developing ways to control the environment and ultimately allow Greenhouse Gases to continue to be released into the atmosphere.\n\nRenewable Energy is also another example of a technological fix, as technology is being used in attempts to reduce and mitigate the effects of global warming. Renewable Energy refers to technologies that has been designed to be eco-friendly and efficient for the well-being of the Earth. They are generally regarded as infinite energy sources, which means they will never run out, unlike fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which are finite sources of energy. They additionally release no green house gases such as carbon dioxide, which is harmful for the planet as it depletes the ozone layer. Examples of renewable energy can be seen by wind turbines, solar energy such as solar panels and kinetic energy from waves. These energies are regarded as a technological fix as they have been designed and innovated to overcome issues with energy insecurity, as well as to help protect Earth from the harmful emissions released from non-renewable energy sources, and thus overcome global warming. It is also known that such technologies will in turn require their own technological fixes. For example, some types of solar energy have local impacts on ambient temperature, which can be a hazard to birdlife.\n\nIt has been made explicit within society that the world's population is rapidly increasing, with the \"UNICEF estimating that an average of 353,000 babies are born each day around the world.\" Therefore, it is expected that the production of food will not be able to progress and develop to keep up with the needs of species. Ester Boserup highlighted in 1965 that when the human population increases and food production decreases, an innovation will take place. This can be demonstrated in the technological development of hydroponics and genetically modified crops.\nHydroponics is an example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to recognise a problem within society, such as the lack of food for an increasing population, and therefore attempt to fix this problem with the development of an innovative technology. Hydroponics is a method of food production to increase productivity, in an \"artificial environment.\" The soil is replaced by a mineral solution that is left around the plant roots. Removing the soil allows a greater crop yield, as there is less chance of soil-born diseases, as well as being able to monitor plant growth and mineral concentrations. This innovative technology to yield more food reflects the ability for humans to develop their way out of a problem, portraying a technological fix.\n\nGenetically modified organism (GMO) reflect the use of technology to innovate our way out of a problem such as the lack of food to cater for the growing population, demonstrating a technological fix. GM crops can create many advantages, such as higher food fields, added vitamins and increased farm profits. Depending on the modifications, they may also introduce the problem of increasing resistance to pesticides and herbicides, which may inevitably precipitate the need for further fixes in the future.\n\nGolden rice is one example of a technological fix. It demonstrates the ability for humans to develop and innovate themselves out of problems, such as the deficiency of vitamin A in Taiwan and Philippines, in which the World Health Organization reported that about 250 million preschool children are affected by. Through the technological development of GM Crops, scientists were able to develop golden rice that can be grown in these countries with genetically higher levels of beta-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A). This enables healthier and fulfilling lifestyles for these individuals and consequently helps to reduce the deaths caused by the deficiency.\n\nExternalities refer to the unforeseen or unintended consequences of technology. It is evident that everything new and innovative can potentially have negative effects, especially if it is a new area of development. Although technologies are invented and developed to solve certain perceived problems, they often create other problems in the process.\n\nDDT was initially use by the Military in World War II to control a range of different illnesses, varying from Malaria to the bubonic plague and body lice. Due to the efficiency of DDT, it was soon adopted as a farm pesticide to help maximise crop yields to consequently cope with the rising populations food demands post WWII. This pesticide proved to be extremely effective in killing bugs and animals on crops, and was often referred as the \"wonder-chemical.\" However, despite being banned for over forty years, we are still facing the externalities of this technology. It was found that DDT had major health impacts on both humans and animals. It was found that DDT accumulated within the fatty cells of both humans and animals and therefore highlights that technological fixes have their negatives as well as positives. \n\nGlobal warming can be a natural phenomenon that occurs in long (geologic) cycles. However, it has been found that man-made ozone layer depletion and the release of Greenhouse Gases through industry, and traffic, causes the earth to heat up to unnatural temperatures. This is causing externalities on the environment, such as melting icecaps, shifting biomes and extinction of many aquatic species, through ocean acidification and changing temperatures.\n\nAutomobiles with internal combustion engines have revolutionised civilisation and technology. However, whilst the technology was new and innovative, helping to connect places through the ability of transport, it was not recognised at the time that burning fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, inside the engines would release pollutants. This is an explicit example of an externality caused by a technological fix, as the problems caused from the development of the technology was not recognised at the time.\n\nHigh-tech megaprojects are large scale and require huge sums of investment and revenue to be created. Examples of these high technologies are Dams, nuclear power plants, and airports. They usually cause externalities on other factors such as the environment, are highly expensive, and are top-down governmental plans. \nThe Three Gorges Dam is an example of a high-tech technological fix. The creation of the multi-purpose navigation hydropower and flood control scheme was designed to fix the issues with flooding whilst providing efficient, clean renewable hydro-electric power in China. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500 MW). The dam is the largest operating hydroelectric facility in terms of annual energy generation, generating 83.7 TWh in 2013 and 98.8 TWh in 2014, while the annual energy generation of the Itaipú Dam in Brazil and Paraguay was 98.6 TWh in 2013 and 87.8 in 2014. It was estimated to have cost over £25 billion. There have been many externalies from this technology, such as the extinction of the Chinese River Dolphin, an increase in pollution, as the river can no longer 'flush' itself, and over 4 million locals being displaced in the area.\n\nIs usually small-scale and cheap technologies that are usually seen in developing countries. The capital to build and create these technologies are usually low, yet labour is high. Local expertise can be used to maintain these technologies making them very quick and effective to build and repair. An example of an intermediate technology can be seen by water wells, rain barrels and pumpkin tanks.\n\nTechnology that suits the level of income, skills and needs of the people. Therefore, this factor encompasses both high and low technologies.\n\nAn example of this can be seen by developing countries that implement technologies that suit their expertise, such as rain barrels and hand pumps. These technologies are low costing and can be maintained by local skills, making them affordable and efficient. However, to implement rain barrels in a developed country would not be appropriate, as it would not suit the technological advancement apparent in these countries. Therefore, appropriate technological fixes take into consideration the level of development within a country before implementing them.\n\nMichael and Joyce Huesemann caution against the hubris of large-scale techno-fixes In the book \"Techno-Fix: Why Technology Won't Save Us Or the Environment\" they show why negative unintended consequences of science and technology are inherently unavoidable and unpredictable, why counter-technologies or techno-fixes are no lasting solutions, and why modern technology in current context does not promote sustainability but instead collapse. Naomi Klein is a prominent opponent of the view that simply technological fixes will solve our problems. She explained her concerns in her book \"\" and states that technical fixes for climate change such as geoengineering bring significant risks as \"we simply don't know enough about the Earth system to be able to re-engineer it safely\". According to her the proposed technique of dimming the rays of the sun with sulphate-spraying helium balloons in order to mimic the cooling effect on the atmosphere of large volcanic eruptions for instance is highly dangerous and such schemes will surely be attempted if abrupt climate change gets seriously under way. Various experts and environmental groups have also come forward with their concerns over views and approaches that look for techno fixes as solutions and warn that those would be \"misguided, unjust, profoundly arrogant and endlessly dangerous\" approaches as well as over the prospect of a technological 'fix' for global warming, however impractical, causing lessened political pressure for a real solution.\n\n"}

Covering approximately 5,000 sq ft of facade space and 10,000 sq ft of total painted surface, it is the tallest and largest indoor staircase mural. While deploying site specific collaborative art practice of allowing more than 1000 employees of the office building, to participate in the experience of painting in the initial phase, the artist conceptualised the creation as a public art project.\n\nThe methodology of creation was the first-of-its-kind simultaneous use of four different art practices engaging in conceptual, site specific, collaborative, and performance art. Gupta allowed the 3500 employees at the site, the experience of putting their brush strokes, while on their job, in the initial half of the project. As a part of his performance art, he executed a series of roles while teaching and motivating employees. At the same time, the artist engaged the employees in his practice of team-building exercise through art while creating a five floor high artwork.\nIn the second half of the project, the colours and strokes were taken as raw stock for creating the composition. He proceeded with the three-month performance art alone; live in front of 3500 employees and almost as many visitors at the site (the campus) to evolve a storyline. Keeping in mind the visibility of the staircase all over the campus through a 60 ft high glass facade, the site specific intervention amalgamated the background wall and the front face of the staircase perspectives of five floors into a single canvas merging surrounding sides and roof within one composition.\n\nThe other notable feature of the invention was a marathon performance by the artist working non stop on his creation for three months except for few hours of rest and sleep at night.\n\nWhen commissioned by Bharti Airtel Ltd to create a “staircase artwork” at their headquarters, the artist brought forth his idea born out of a decade and a half practice of public art projects to a radical reorientation towards introducing a unique sustainable development process in corporate entity, thus establishing that the art can contribute to the business environment as well, by refreshing the intangible quality of its soft power among employees.\n\nA philosophical perspective was highlighted in the artist's statement while addressing the translation of his sustainable development ideology in his site specific intervention. \n"}
