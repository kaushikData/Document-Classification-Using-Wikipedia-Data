This group is now the largest in Benin. Another source claims the Aja were the rulers of Dahomey (Benin) until 1893, when the French conquered them. Currently, there are approximately 500,000 Ajas in an area straddling the border between Benin and Togo, long and wide.\n\nThe Aja speak a language known as Aja-Gbe, or simply 'Aja'; only 1-5% are literate in their native tongue. According to one source, \"voodoo\" originated with the Aja. There are three dialects: Tàgóbé (in Togo only), Dògóbè (in Benin only), and Hwègbè (in both countries). Many are trilingual, also speaking French and Fongbe, the lingua-franca of southern Benin, while Ewe is spoken as a second language by those Aja living in Togo and Ghana.\n\nDue to severe land shortages in the densely populated Togolese-Beninois border region mentioned above, many Aja have migrated in recent years, seeking arable land for subsistence farming or work in urban centers. There are a significant number of Aja living throughout the coastal region of Benin and Togo, southern Nigeria and Gabon. The urban centers of Cotonou, Lome, Lagos and Libreville all have significant Aja migrant populations.\n\nThe Aja, Fon, Ewe, Ga-Adangbe accounted for most of the people carried to the Americas from the Bight of Benin, Togo and Ghana in the transatlantic slave trade prior to the late eighteenth century (when Yoruba people became the more common captives from the region).\n\n\n"}

Medical experts have dismissed his claims as quackery.\n\nPrioré was born in Trieste, Italy. Prioré received training in electrical engineering and was a radar technician for the Italian Navy. (Perisse, 1984) He was a prisoner of the German Nazi occupation of Bordeaux, France, until he was rescued by Louis Durand police captain and membre of the French Resistance in 1944. (Bird, 1984)\n\nPriore worked for 25 years (between 1950 and 1975) in Bordeaux, and built a series of electromagnetic devices producing a strong magnetic field of 600 gauss (60 mT) or more for the purpose of treating cancer and disease.\n\nHis last device was funded by the French government with the help of one-time Prime Minister of France Jacques Chaban-Delmas. Prioré also built a large device (M-600) for the purpose of treating people with cancer. (Graille, 1984) Prioré reported to have treated a number of animals with cancer with his device, but it broke down before it could be applied to human patients. (Graille, 1984) Prioré claimed to have cured a number of terminal cancer patients with his earlier devices. (Bird, 1984) Prioré's research attracted the attention of the French media in 1965 who dubbed it \"L'affaire Priore\".\n\nIn 1965, one event exposed possible foul play in Prioré's experimental research involving \"English mice.\" Mice with experimental cancers sent to Prioré from the Chester Beatty Institute in England lead to controversy over his research. After Prioré exposed the mice to radiation from his devices, they were sent back to the Institute. Scientists from the Institute claimed the mice returned to them were not genuine because they rejected new cancer grafts. One scientist with the Institute, Pierette Chateaurenaud-Duprat, retorted the claim stating the mice showed signs of immunity to the cancers they were originally grafted with. (Graille, 1984) Prioré's colleagues supported his research until his death in 1983. Immunologist Raymond Pautrizel and Robert Courier, former secretary of the French Academy of Sciences, published a series of notes on Prioré's research in the proceedings of the French Academy. (Graille, 1984) Pautrizel, an apologist, classified Prioré's methodology as immunological in nature, since animals inoculated with deadly doses of parasites were reportedly healed with Prioré radiation. According to Bird (1984), a supporter, Priore's methodology was also characterized by boosting subjects' immune systems, allowing them to heal themselves of incurable diseases.\n\nAntoine Prioré died on May 9, 1983 of a stroke. (Perisse, 1984) Jean-Michel Graille, a French journalist, met with Raymond Pautrizel and wrote a book on the Priore affair, \"Dossier Priore\".\n\nPrioré was accused of manipulating his scientific data by the French Academy of Sciences. French journalists also accused Prioré of not understanding his own technique for treating cancer and disease. Prioré never exposed his exact method, believing others would only steal it for themselves. Members of the French Academy of Sciences and media alike seriously questioned the legitimacy of Prioré's research, with many accusing him of fraud. (Graille, 1984) \n\nThe U.S. Office of Naval Research evaluated Prioré's patents. The patents seemed deliberately made unclear, leaving little information to ascertain the mechanical and electromagnetic workings of Prioré's devices. Physicist Pierre Aigrain, the head of the General Delegation for Scientific and Technical Research (DGRST) has written that \"the biological effects resulting from the radiation emitted by M Priore's apparatus have no connection with cancer... to speak of a therapeutic apparatus capable of helping the sick is pure romancing.\"\n\nPrioré's education has also been called into question. For example, Solly Zuckerman has described Prioré as a \"self-taught electrical technician.\"\n\n\n"}

They have formerly been part of the so-called Khamseh confederation which includes Persian- Turkic- and Arabic-speaking tribes. Their migratory area is around Shiraz. The \"tent\" is the basic unit of social organization among the Basseri. All tents have a recognized head that deals with the formal officers of the tribe, villagers, and other strangers. The Basseri economy stems mainly from sheep and goats. \nBasseries are mostly Persians .Their origin is the \"Pasargadean\" tribe.The Pasargadean tribe was the biggest tribe of Persia and the tribe who helped Cyrus The Great constitute the Achaemenid Empire.They named \"Karian\" tribe in Sasanian Empire period.They were the relers of some parts of south Persia and the Karyan city of Persia cause They helped Ardashir I constitute the Sasanian empire.\nAfter Muslim conquest of Persia They were under rule of Arabic Tribes of South Persia ,who migrated to Persia after its conquest, till the constitute of Zand Dynasty by Karim Khan.In Pahlavi Dynasty period They were settled by the government in 1930 and again started to decamp in 1941.After the Land Reformations of Iran ,they were settled in the cities and the villages of Fars Province; but after some years,They again started decamoing. after the Islamic Revolution of Iran because of the problems of being nomad including inaccessibility to modern facilities (hospitals,schools ,etc);successive droughts;destruction of the migration path ;etc they again went to cities and the villages of the province for living.\n\nThe word \"Basseri\" was originally \"Wastaryoshan\", the commoners of Sasanian Empire period.a compound of \"Wastary\" word and \"osh\" suffix.The \"W\" phoneme in Wastary alterd to \"B\" and the \"T\" phoneme removed due to less energy consumption in talking.therefore the word Shifted to the Basseri.\n\nBasseries are Shia Muslims but minorities of Sunni Muslims are existed in tribe.They became Muslims after the Arabs invaded Iran almost 1400 years ago. They converted to Shi'ism following the Safavid invasion in the 16th century CE. Previously, Basseries were Zoroastrians like the majority of Persians, before the arrival of Islam to the region.\n\nThe Basseri seem not to be very familiar with Muslim beliefs, customs, and ceremonies.They do not respect to divisions and events of the Muslim year,Although villagers remind them continually. Basseries pay more attention to life cycle ceremonies than Islamic ceremonies like Ramadan and Moharram which are the most important for other Muslims.\n\nThe Basseri speak a dialect of Persian in a variety that has maintained some Old Persian words not found in modern Persian. The majority know only the Basseri dialect, but a few also speak Turkish or Arabic.\n\nSome words in Basseri dialect are similar to English words.\n\nThe Basseri habitat was originally Fars district; but big Basseri Communities are also in Khuzestan, Isfahan, Razavi Khorasan, Semnan and Tehran.\nThe winter land of the Basseri is in Jahrom and north of Larestan County.They stay in Marvdasht, Pasargad ,and Eqlid in summers.\nThe chief of the Basseri tribe rules through coercive authority. The main functions of the chief are: to allocate pastures and coordinate the migration of the tribes, settle disputes that are brought to him, and represent the tribe or any of its members in politically important dealings with sedentary authorities. Most matters of law are governed by custom and compromise in the Basseri tribe and is regulated by diffuse sanctions. However the chief will serve as a mediator for cases that can't be solved through tradition because of the matters of the case. The chief is not bound by precedent or custom in his decision, and his decision will be based on what he feels is \"best for the tribe\".\n\nThe Darbar consist of Basseri tribe members who are closest with the chief and always migrate with him. Within the Darbar there is a personal valet, master of the stores, a groom for the chief's riding horse, a scribe, and a hunting/drinking companion.\n\nAll packing tools and rugs are locally made, woven by the women. Women's clothes are largely sewn from bought material, while male clothing is bought finished.\n\nBasseri tribe rugs (see also Shiraz rug) are asymmetrically knotted, brighter in colours, with more open space and smaller ornaments and figure with Orange as the specific color. The women of the tribe usually make the rugs.\n\nThe Basseri has two great sections called Waysi () and Ali-mirzai (). Each section has several clans.

Organized by Emmeline Pankhurst's Women's Social and Political Union, the march took place four days after Black Friday, a suffragette protest outside the House of Commons that saw the women violently attacked by police.\n\nTaking place in the context of the debate over the Conciliation Bill 1910 (giving a limited number of women the vote according to property and marital status), the march was a direct response to the statement by the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith that: \"The Government will, if they are still in power, give facilities in the next Parliament for effectively proceeding with a Bill which is framed so as to admit of free amendment\", which suggested that the bill would have no chance of being passed.\n\nEmmeline and Christabel Pankhurst were at Caxton Hall when news arrived of Asquith's speech; Christabel announced to the audience that it was a declaration of war: \"The promise for next parliament is an absurd mockery of a pledge. They have been talking of declarations of war. We also declare war from this moment.\" Emmeline told the crowd: \"I am going to Downing Street. Come along, all of you.\"\n\nAround 200 women marched on Downing Street, smashing windows at the Colonial Office and Home Office, and on Asquith's car; 159 women and three men were arrested, including Emmeline and her sister, Mary Clarke. Clarke was arrested for throwing a stone through the window at Canon Row Police Station, where Emmeline was being held, after the police refused to let Clarke see her. About 20 women approached 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's residence, from the back and swarmed around Augustine Birrell, the Chief Secretary for Ireland.

{"id": "3832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3832", "title": "Bauhaus", "text": "Bauhaus\n\nThe Staatliches Bauhaus (), commonly known as the Bauhaus, was a German art school operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught.\n\nThe Bauhaus was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar. The German term \"Bauhaus\"—literally \"building house\"—was understood as meaning \"School of Building\", but in spite of its name and the fact that its founder was an architect, the Bauhaus did not have an architecture department during its first years of existence. Nonetheless, it was founded with the idea of creating a \"total\" work of art (Gesamtkunstwerk) in which all arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, Modernist architecture and art, design and architectural education. The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography.\n\nThe school existed in three German cities: Weimar from 1919 to 1925, Dessau from 1925 to 1932, and Berlin from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: Walter Gropius from 1919 to 1928, Hannes Meyer from 1928 to 1930, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the Nazi regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.\n\nThe changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.\n\nGermany's defeat in World War I, the fall of the German monarchy and the abolition of censorship under the new, liberal Weimar Republic allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the Russian Revolution, such as constructivism. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical. Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer William Morris, who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function. Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the International Style, was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.\n\nHowever, the most important influence on Bauhaus was modernism, a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus—the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that mass production was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit—were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization Deutscher Werkbund was formed in 1907 by Hermann Muthesius to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).\nThe entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as Neues Bauen. Beginning in June 1907, Peter Behrens' pioneering industrial design work for the German electrical company AEG successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark AEG Turbine Factory, and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer worked for him in this period.\n\nThe Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German zeitgeist had turned from emotional Expressionism to the matter-of-fact New Objectivity. An entire group of working architects, including Erich Mendelsohn, Bruno Taut and Hans Poelzig, turned away from fanciful experimentation, and turned toward rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a \"minimal dwelling\" written into the new Weimar Constitution. Ernst May, Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner, among others, built large housing blocks in Frankfurt and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the Weissenhof Estate, films, and sometimes fierce public debate.\n\nThe Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in Moscow, has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a basic course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus, but it was less publicised outside the Soviet Union and consequently, is less familiar in the West.\n\nWith the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus. The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, El Lissitzky's book \"Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution\" published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.\n\nThe school was founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar in 1919, as a merger of the Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in 1906, and directed by Belgian Art Nouveau architect Henry van de Velde. When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, Hermann Obrist and August Endell as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by the destruction of World War I and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of the fine arts and the applied arts (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school's existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus. In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled \"Exhibition of Unknown Architects\", Gropius proclaimed his goal as being \"to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist.\" Gropius' neologism \"Bauhaus\" references both building and the Bauhütte, a premodern guild of stonemasons. The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school, crafts school, and academy of the arts. Swiss painter Johannes Itten, German-American painter Lyonel Feininger, and German sculptor Gerhard Marcks, along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1919. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor and designer Oskar Schlemmer who headed the theater workshop, and Swiss painter Paul Klee, joined in 1922 by Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter Theo van Doesburg to Weimar to promote \"De Stijl\" (\"The Style\"), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect El Lissitzky.\nFrom 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of Johannes Itten, who taught the \"Vorkurs\" or \"preliminary course\" that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus. Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of Franz Cižek and Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the Der Blaue Reiter group in Munich, as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist Oskar Kokoschka. The influence of German Expressionism favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of Der Blaue Reiter founding member Wassily Kandinsky to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1922. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer László Moholy-Nagy, who rewrote the \"Vorkurs\" with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favored by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907, when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while Hermann Muthesius had begun implementing industrial prototypes.\n\nGropius was not necessarily against Expressionism, and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this \"new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery\", described \"painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future.\" By 1923, however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring Romanesque cathedrals and the craft-driven aesthetic of the \"Völkisch movement\", instead declaring \"we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars.\" Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called \"Bauhaus\" and a series of books called \"Bauhausbücher\". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.\n\nWeimar was in the German state of Thuringia, and the Bauhaus school received state support from the Social Democrat-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus' exhibition of the experimental Haus am Horn. The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half. The Bauhaus issued a press release on 26 December 1924, setting the closure of the school for the end of March 1925. At this point it had already been looking for alternative sources of funding. After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to Bauhaus-University Weimar.\n\nGropius's design for the Dessau facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the International style lines of the Fagus Factory than the stripped down Neo-classical of the Werkbund pavilion or the \"Völkisch\" Sommerfeld House. During the Dessau years, there was a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect Mart Stam to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.\n\nMeyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928, and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.\n\nBut Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of Herbert Bayer, Marcel Breuer, and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930. The Dessau city council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Mies was appointed in 1930, and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. He halted the school's manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching, and appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant Lilly Reich. By 1931, the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) was becoming more influential in German politics. When it gained control of the Dessau city council, it moved to close the school.\n\nIn late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin (Birkbusch Street 49) to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the Gestapo closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school .\n\nAlthough neither the Nazi Party nor Adolf Hitler had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like Wilhelm Frick and Alfred Rosenberg had already labeled the Bauhaus \"un-German\" and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, a number of communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the Soviet Union when he was fired in 1930.\n\nEven before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its \"degenerate art\", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish influences of \"cosmopolitan modernism\". Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the \"New Bauhaus\" of Chicago: Mies decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago and to seek building commissions. The simple engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences living on in Nazi Germany. When Hitler's chief engineer, Fritz Todt, began opening the new autobahn (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were \"bold examples of modernism\"—among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.\n\nThe paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building, the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), he and his partner Adolf Meyer observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in Jena, and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower, which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 Haus am Horn, student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.\n\nIn the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed \"Laubenganghäuser\" (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.\n\nMies van der Rohe repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's \"study of essentials\", and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a \"spatial implementation of intellectual decisions\", which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither Mies van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.\n\nThe popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries Bruno Taut, Hans Poelzig and particularly Ernst May, as the city architects of Berlin, Dresden and Frankfurt respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in Weimar Germany. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop Onkel Toms Hütte, is still occupied.\n\nThe Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada and Israel in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime. Tel Aviv in 2004 was named to the list of world heritage sites by the UN due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture; it had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 onwards.\n\nIn 1928, the Hungarian painter Alexander Bortnyik founded a school of design in Budapest called Miihely (also \"Muhely\" or \"Mugely\"), which means \"the studio\". Located on the seventh floor of a house on Nagymezo Street, it was meant to be the Hungarian equivalent to the Bauhaus. The literature sometimes refers to it—in an oversimplified manner—as \"the Budapest Bauhaus\". Bortnyik was a great admirer of László Moholy-Nagy and had met Walter Gropius in Weimar between 1923 and 1925. Moholy-Nagy himself taught at the Miihely. Victor Vasarely, a pioneer of Op Art, studied at this school before establishing in Paris in 1930.\n\nWalter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and Moholy-Nagy re-assembled in Britain during the mid 1930s to live and work in the Isokon project before the war caught up with them. Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced The Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the Alan I W Frank House in Pittsburgh, among other projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as Philip Johnson, I. M. Pei, Lawrence Halprin and Paul Rudolph, among many others.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Mies van der Rohe re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential Philip Johnson, and became one of the pre-eminent architects in the world. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the New Bauhaus school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist Walter Paepcke. This school became the Institute of Design, part of the Illinois Institute of Technology. Printmaker and painter Werner Drewes was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both Columbia University and Washington University in St. Louis. Herbert Bayer, sponsored by Paepcke, moved to Aspen, Colorado in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the Aspen Institute. In 1953, Max Bill, together with Inge Aicher-Scholl and Otl Aicher, founded the Ulm School of Design (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung—HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of semiotics as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the \"Ulm Model\" concept continues to influence international design education.\n\nThe influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus \"Vorkurs\" (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes. This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the \"Vorkurs\" and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that \"A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove\".\n\nOne of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of modern furniture design. The ubiquitous Cantilever chair and the Wassily Chair designed by Marcel Breuer are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer Mart Stam over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.) The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.\n\nThe physical plant at Dessau survived World War II and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the German Democratic Republic. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of \"Bauhausbühne\" (\"Bauhaus Stage\"). After German reunification, a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s. In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.\n\nLater evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of \"… the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature…Home hygiene without home atmosphere.\"\n\nThe White City of Tel Aviv (, \"Ha-Ir HaLevana\") refers to a collection of over 4,000 Bauhaus or International style buildings built in Tel Aviv from the 1930s by German Jewish architects who emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine after the rise of the Nazis. Tel Aviv has the largest number of buildings in this style of any city in the world. In 2003, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) proclaimed Tel Aviv's \"White City\" a World Cultural Heritage site, as \"an outstanding example of new town planning and architecture in the early 20th century.\"\n\nEstablished in 2000, Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv is an organization dedicated to the ongoing documentation of the architectural heritage. In 2003, it hosted an exhibition on preservation of the architecture that showcased 25 buildings. To further the architectural culture in the city, a small Bauhaus Museum opened in Tel Aviv in 2008, designed by Israeli architect Ron Arad.\n\nPeople who were educated, or who taught or worked in other capacities, at the Bauhaus.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Alternative names are Rudari (Ludari), Lingurari and Zlătari.\n\nThe Boyash are a branch/caste of the Roma who were forced to settle in the 14th century in the Apuseni Mountains, located in Transylvania, and work as slaves in mining (a regionalism for \"mine\" in Romanian: \"baie,\" from Middle Age Slavonic). Due to their close proximity with the Romanian-speaking people, they lost the use of the Romani language, and started using the Romanian language. Some groups relearned Romani when they came in contact with other Romani-speaking Roma, after they later emigrated from Romania (for example, in Ecuador).\n\nAt the end of the 16th century the Boyash started migrating towards the south, in Wallachia, and the east, in Moldavia, where they were held as slaves together with other Romani groups (until the slavery was abolished in 1855-56).\n\nAnother name for the Boyash, \"Rudari\", comes from the Slavic \"ruda\" (\"metal\", \"ore\"). As the mines became inefficient, the Boyash people were forced to readjust by earning their living making wood utensils (\"Lingurari\" means \"spoon-makers\" in Romanian; also cf. Serbian \"ruda\", Hungarian \"rúd\", Romanian \"rudă\" meaning \"staff, rod, pole, stick\"). The nickname \"Kashtale\" (\"wood-workers\") was also given to them by the Romani-speaking Roma and it has remained in Romani as a more general word for a Rom who does not speak Romani.\n\nAfter the point at which they began to make wood tools they scattered themselves in isolated communities. The consequence of this is that nowadays they speak a distinct archaic dialect of Romanian, with borrowings from other surrounding languages.\n\nAfter the liberation of the Roma from slavery (by the middle of the 19th century), many emigrated to other countries, especially Hungary and the Balkans, but also as far as the Americas, South Africa and Australia.\n\nIn 1993, about 14,000 of the 280,000 recorded Hungarian Roma were Boyash.\n\nIn Croatia, the Boyash are settled in several small communities along the Hungarian border in the regions of Međimurje, the Podravina, Slavonija and Baranja with an overflow of settlers living in the Apatin county of Vojvodina, Serbia. 2005 saw the Boyash language of Croatia published in its own alphabet for the first time in the Catholic Catechism, published by the HBK Glas Koncila in Zagreb. In 2007, the first Bible—a children's Bible—was published by OM EAST in Austria and facilitated by The Romani Bible Union.\n\nIn English, the commonly accepted name for the ethnic group is \"Boyash\", however in contemporary Bulgaria the terms \"Ludari\" and \"Rudari\" are in common use, while in Romania both terms are present in some form: \"Rudari\" and \"Băieşi\".\n\nFor the same ethnic group in Hungary and Croatia the terms \"Beyash\" and \"Bayash\" (Bajaši) are now officially used. The ethnonym \"Banyash\" (\"miner\") in Serbia is known only among the group settled in Bačka region, living along the river Danube, near the border with Croatia and Hungary. This term is only sporadically understood, and not used among some other Banyash groups in the Serbian Banat region, e.g. the village of Uljma.\n\nThey are also known by many appellations based on trades; in addition to Rudari/Ludari (\"miners\", from Serbian and Bulgarian \"ruda\" \"ore, metal\") they are known as \"Kopanari\" (\"cradle-makers\", from Serbian and Bulgarian \"kopanja\" \"wooden box\"), \"Koritari\" (\"trough-makers\"), \"Lingurara\" (\"spoon-makers\", cf. Romanian \"lingură\" \"spoon\") and \"Ursari\" (cf. Romanian \"urs\" \"bear\") or \"Mechkara\" (\"bear-trainers\").\n\nEducation in the Romanian language is available only for the Banyash living in Romanian villages in the Serbian Banat, as well as in Hungary, in the \"beás\" subdialect of the Romanian language spoken by Boyash communities in (central and western) Hungary.\n\nDuring the last few years there have been several attempts on behalf of local non-governmental organizations in East Bačka region to introduce optional classes in Romanian. According to 2004 field research data, only two such projects are still going on there: optional classes in Romanian in the village of Vajska, and kindergarten in the local Ardeal dialect in Bački Monoštor, attended by 20 pupils altogether.\n\n"}

It is a mixed language (referred to as a Para-Romani language in Romani linguistics) based on Romance grammar, with an adstratum of Romani lexical items through language shift by the Romani community. It is often used as an argot, a secret language for discreet communication amongst Iberian Romani. Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, and Spanish are closely related varieties that share a common root.\n\nSpanish caló, or Spanish Romani, was originally known as . Portuguese , or Portuguese Romani, also goes by the term ; it used to be referred to as , but this word acquired the general sense of jargon or slang, often with a negative conotation (cf. , 'obscene language', lit. low-level ).\n\n is the endonym of the Romani people in Iberia, and means \"the language spoken by the . However, the are commonly known in Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking countries by the exonyms and .\n\nIn and other varieties of Romani, means \"black or \"absorbing all light\", hence closely resembling words for \"black\" and/or \"dark\" in Indo-Aryan languages (e.g. Sanskrit काल \"kāla\" \"black\", \"of a dark colour\"). Hence and may have originated as ancient exonyms. For instance, the name of the Domba people, from whom the Romani, Sinti and Kale people are now believed to have emerged, also implies \"dark-skinned\" in some Indian languages.\n\nThree main groupings of dialects are distinguished in what is technically Iberian but most commonly referred to simply as (Spanish) or Spanish Romani:\n\nIn modern Romani linguistics, all are jointly referred to as Iberian Romani (Spanish: or ).\n\nCaló has six vowels:\nIt has the following consonant inventory:\nNotable phonological features of Iberian Caló are:\n\nSpanish Romani:\nCompare with a Spanish version:\n\nMany Caló terms have been borrowed in Spanish (especially as slangisms and colloquialisms), often through flamenco lyrics and criminal jargon (germanía).\n\nExamples are (\"man/woman\", from \"gadjo/gadji\"), (\"boy\", originally \"son\", also present in English as \"chav\"), (\"money\"), or (\"to work\"), (\"excellent\"), (\"feet\"), (\"cold\"), (\"baby\"), (\"silly, stupid\"), (\"outstanding, genuine\"), or (\"god/goddess\"), (\"demond\"), (\"to steal\"), also present in English slang as \"to chaw\", (\"to like\"), (\"bed\"), (\"eyes\"), (\"head\"), (\"face\"), (\"nose\"), (\"mouth\"), (\"shame\"), (\"vain\"), (\"bad, nasty, dodgy\"), (\"cheeky, soldier\"), (\"fake\"), (\"luck\"), (\"pretence\"), (\"slender, graceful\"), or (\"old\"), (\"to sleep\"), or (\"house\"), (\"house, gambling den\"), (\"to eat\"), (\"hit\"), (\"to defecate, to fear\"), (\"to give, to die\"), (\"to die, to snuff it\"), (\"to get upset\"), (\"to pay\"), (\"lame\"), or (\"crazy\"), (\"to leave\", \"to make oneself scarce\"), (\"to break\"), (\"to denounce \"sb\", to squeal\"), (\"informer\"), (\"to pretend to be absent-minded\"), \"pringar\" (\"to get \"sb\" mixed up, to overdo\"), (\"to have sexual relations, to bother\"), (\"little\"), (\"to flee\"), (\"drink, to drink\"), (\"to steal\"), (\"no way, there isn't\"), (\"thief\"), (\"to get intimidated\"), (\"to nick\"), (\"to nick\"), (\"shut your mouth\"), or (\"fear\"), (\"Romani person\"), (\"Romani person\"), (\"language of the Iberian Kale\"), (\"money\"), (\"drunkenness\"), (\"non-Romani person\"), (\"myself\"), and (\"heart\").\n\nSome words underwent a shift in meaning in the process: (etymologically related to Sanskrit \"kāma\", \"love, desire\") in colloquial Spanish has the meaning of \"to woo, to seduce, to deceive by adulation\" (but also \"to love\", \"to want\"; although this sense has fallen into disuse), however in Caló it more closely matches the Spanish meanings of (\"to want\" and \"to love\"). In addition and the noun can also mean either \"lie\" or \"con\".\n\nCaló also appears to have influenced quinqui, the language of another Iberian group of travellers who are not ethnically Romani.\n\nTo a lesser extent than in Spanish, Caló terms have also been adapted into Catalan as slangisms and colloquialisms, most of which were taken adopted from Spanish slang.\n\nExamples are ( or ; \"to eat\"), (\"boy\"), (\"to die\"), (\"to die\"), (\"fear\"), (\"non-Romani person\"), (\"money\"), (\"language of the Iberian Kale\"), (\"prison\"), (\"to nick\"), (\"to nick\"), (\"to steal\"), (\"to steal\"), (\"to like\"), (\"to get \"sb\" mixed up, to overdo\"), (\"to leave, to make oneself scarce\"), (\"to sleep\"), (\"drink, to drink\"), (\"pleb\"), (\"shame\"), (\"stink\"), (\"outstanding, genuine\"), (\"to denounce \"sb\", to squeal\"), (\"informer\"), (\"to get upset\"), (lit. \"Do a long one\" fig. \"to pretend to be thick/slow\") and (\"luck\").\n\nAs with Catalan, there is a smaller number of words of Caló origin and many of those are indirect loans, borrowed via Spanish.\n\nWell-known examples generally understood by most or all speakers of Portuguese include (, \"man, dude\", primarily in Portugal), chavalo (\"lad, young boy\") (, , generally \"impact\", but in this sense \"sudden happiness\"), (, , \"to work hard\", lit. \"to grate oneself\"), (, , \"to scamper, to skip, to run\", lit. \"to grate one's chest\"), (, \"mess\"), (, , \"bowling\"), (, , \"tip, clue\"), (, , \"bargain, haggled\"), (, , \"to be charmed, to fall in love with, to be obsessed by\"), (, , \"dice\", more commonly ; \"[thin] fingers and/or toes\", more commonly ), (, , \"failure with a compromise\", lit. limped/hobbled) and (, , \"drunkenness\"), chulé (\"bad smell of feet), chunga (\"of bad quality\"), pirar-se (\"to leave\"), pirado and chalado (\"crazy\"), chibar-se (\"to denounce sb, to squeal\"), chibo (\"informer\").\n\nThere is a growing awareness and appreciation for Caló: \"...until the recent work by Luisa Rojo, in the Autonomous University of Madrid, not even the linguistics community recognized the significance and problems of Caló and its world.\" Its world includes songs, poetry and flamenco.\n\nAs Iberian Romani proper is extinct and as Caló is endangered, some people are trying to revitalise the language. The Spanish politician Juan de Dios Ramírez Heredia promotes Romanò-Kalò, a variant of International Romani, enriched by Caló words. His goal is to reunify the Caló and Romani roots.\n\nIn 1838, the first edition of \"Embéo E Majaró Lucas\" translated by George Borrow was published and began to be distributed in Madrid. This was Borrow's translation of the Gospel of Luke into Caló. A revision of this was printed in 1872.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46489", "title": "Convention on the Rights of the Child", "text": "Convention on the Rights of the Child\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (commonly abbreviated as the CRC or UNCRC) is a human rights treaty which sets out the civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children. The Convention defines a child as any human being under the age of eighteen, unless the age of majority is attained earlier under national legislation.\n\nNations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international law. Compliance is monitored by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which is composed of members from countries around the world. Once a year, the Committee submits a report to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which also hears a statement from the CRC Chair, and the Assembly adopts a Resolution on the Rights of the Child.\n\nGovernments of countries that have ratified the Convention are required to report to, and appear before, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child periodically to be examined on their progress with regards to the advancement of the implementation of the Convention and the status of child rights in their country. Their reports and the committee's written views and concerns are available on the committee's website.\n\nThe UN General Assembly adopted the Convention and opened it for signature on 20 November 1989 (the 30th anniversary of its Declaration of the Rights of the Child). It came into force on 2 September 1990, after it was ratified by the required number of nations. Currently, 196 countries are party to it, including every member of the United Nations except the United States.\nTwo optional protocols were adopted on 25 May 2000. The First Optional Protocol restricts the involvement of children in military conflicts, and the Second Optional Protocol prohibits the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. Both protocols have been ratified by more than 160 states.\n\nA third optional protocol relating to communication of complaints was adopted in December 2011 and opened for signature on 28 February 2012. It came into effect on 14 April 2014.\n\nThe Convention deals with the child-specific needs and rights. It requires that the \"nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international law\". Ratifying states must act in the best interests of the child. \nIn all jurisdictions implementing the Convention requires compliance with child custody and guardianship laws as that every child has basic rights, including the right to life, to their own name and identity, to be raised by their parents within a family or cultural grouping, and to have a relationship with both parents, even if they are separated.\n\nThe Convention obliges states to allow parents to exercise their parental responsibilities. The Convention also acknowledges that children have the right to express their opinions and to have those opinions heard and acted upon when appropriate, to be protected from abuse or exploitation, and to have their privacy protected, and it requires that their lives not be subject to excessive interference.\n\nThe Convention also obliges signatory states to provide separate legal representation for a child in any judicial dispute concerning their care and asks that the child's viewpoint be heard in such cases.\n\nThe Convention forbids capital punishment for children. In its General Comment 8 (2006) the Committee on the Rights of the Child stated that there was an \"obligation of all state parties to move quickly to prohibit and eliminate all corporal punishment and all other cruel or degrading forms of punishment of children\". Article 19 of the Convention states that state parties must \"take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence\", but it makes no reference to corporal punishment. The Committee's interpretation of this section to encompass a prohibition on corporal punishment has been rejected by several state parties to the Convention, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights has referred to the Convention when interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nGlobal human rights standards were challenged at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna (1993) when a number of governments (prominently China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Iran) raised serious objections to the idea of universal human rights. There are unresolved tensions between \"universalistic\" and \"relativistic\" approaches in the establishment of standards and strategies designed to prevent or overcome the abuse of children's capacity to work.\n\nSome scholars link slavery and slavery-like practices for many child marriages. Child marriage as slavery is not directly addressed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nCurrently 196 countries are parties to the treaty (some with stated reservations or interpretations). This includes every member of the United Nations (except the United States), plus the Cook Islands, Niue, the State of Palestine, and the Holy See. The United States has not ratified it. South Sudan did not sign the convention, however ratification was complete in January 2015. Somalia's domestic ratification finished in January 2015 and the instrument was deposited with the United Nations in October 2015.\n\nAll successor states of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, and Slovakia) made declarations of succession to the treaty and currently apply it.\n\nThe convention does not apply in the territories of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Gibraltar, Guernsey and Tokelau.\n\nAzerbaijan ratified Convention on the Rights of the Child on 21 July 1992. In terms of the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a significant number of laws, decrees and resolutions were approved in Azerbaijan by the President and the Cabinet of Ministers focusing on the development of the child welfare system. In this regard, the Convention №182 on \"Elimination of the worst forms of child labour\" and Recommendation №190 of the International Labour Organization and the Hague Convention on International adoption of children were ratified by Milli Majlis in 2004.\n\nThere is a concern over the administration of juvenile justice in Azerbaijan, mostly regarding compliance with articles 37, 39 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as other relevant standards such as the Beijing Rules, the Riyadh Guidelines and the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty. Therefore, international organizations assisted Azerbaijan to improve the situation in the field of juvenile justice. Juvenile offenders have been added to the Presidential pardons on a regular basis.\n\nAzerbaijan has built cooperation with many international organizations, in particular with UNICEF in the field of child protection. In 1993, UNICEF began its activity in Azerbaijan. In 2005, Azerbaijan and UNICEF signed a 5-year country program. The country program for 2005-2009 was implemented in the field of child protection, children's health and nutrition, children's education and youth health, their development and participation. In addition, UNICEF supports Azerbaijan in developing juvenile justice system, establishing alternative care system and raising awareness among youth about HIV/AIDS.\n\nCanada became a signatory to the Convention on 28 May 1990 and ratified in 1991. Youth criminal laws in Canada underwent major changes resulting in the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) which went into effect on 1 April 2003. The Act specifically refers to Canada's different commitments under the Convention. The convention was influential in the administrative Law decision of \"Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\".\n\nIndia ratified UNCRC on 11 December 1992, agreeing in principles all articles except with certain reservations on issues relating to child labor. In India there is law that children under the age of 18 should not work, but there is no outright ban on child labor, and the practice is generally permitted in most industries except those deemed \"hazardous\". Although a law in October 2006 banned child labor in hotels, restaurants, and as domestic servants, there continues to be high demand for children as hired help in the home. Current estimates as to the number of child laborers in the country range from the government's conservative estimate of 4 million children under 14 years of age to the much higher estimates of children's rights activists, which hover around 60 million. Little is being done to address the problem since the economy is booming and the nuclear family is spreading, thereby increasing demand for child laborers. In India many people are still suffering from non-nutritious food, many parents are still leaving their children on riverside, in trains etc. Under the auspices of the Unicef financed Odisha initiative the Government of India is specifying the outline of a means of change and improvement in child care, and many trusts such as childLine, Plan India and savethechildren too are taking efforts to outdate child labor from India. A few of the organisations who work with children's rights in India are Plan India, CRY (Child Rights and You), Save the Children, Bal Vikas Dhara-New Delhi, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, CHORD-Hyderabad apart from them todo an organization India strives hard to protect the children .\n\nIran has adhered to the convention (except for alleged child slavery) since 1991 and ratified it in the Parliament in 1994. Upon ratification, Iran made the following reservation: \"If the text of the Convention is or becomes incompatible with the domestic laws and Islamic standards at any time or in any case, the Government of the Islamic Republic shall not abide by it.\" Iran has also signed the both optional protocols which relate to the special protection of children against involvement in armed conflict and the sale of children and sexual exploitation.\n\nAlthough Iran is a state party to the Convention, international human rights organisations and foreign governments routinely denounced executions of Iranian child offenders as a violation of the treaty. But on 10 February 2012, Iran's parliament changed the controversial law of executing juveniles. In the new law, the age of 18 (solar year) would be for both genders considered the cut-off for adulthood and offenders under this age will be sentenced under a separate law. Based on the previous Islamic law, which was revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 (lunar year, 11 days shorter than a solar year) were fully responsible for their crimes.\n\n\"According to Islamic sources, the criterion for criminal responsibility is reaching the age of maturity which, according to the Shi'ite School of the IRI, is 9 lunar years (8 years and 9 months) for girls and 15 lunar years (14 years and 7 months) for boys.\"\n\nIreland signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 30 September 1990 and ratified it, without reservation, on 28 September 1992. In response to criticisms expressed in the 1998 review by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva, the Irish government established the office of Ombudsman for Children and drew up a national children's strategy. In 2006, following concerns expressed by the committee that the wording of the Irish Constitution does not allow the State to intervene in cases of abuse other than in very exceptional cases, the Irish government undertook to amend the constitution to make a more explicit commitment to children's rights.\n\nIsrael ratified the Convention in 1991. In 2010, UNICEF criticized Israel for its failure to create a government-appointed commission on children's rights or to adopt a national children's rights strategy or program in order to implement various Israeli laws addressing children's rights. The report criticizes Israel for holding that the Convention does not apply in the West Bank and for defining as Palestinians under the age of 16 in the occupied territories as children, even though Israeli law defines a child as being under 18, in line with the Convention. A contemporaneous report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that Israel's investment in children is below the international average and the actual investment had fallen between 1995 and 2006. In 2012, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child criticized Israel for its bombing attacks on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, stating, \"Destruction of homes and damage to schools, streets and other public facilities gravely affect children\" and called them \"gross violations of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, its Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict and international humanitarian law\". It also criticized Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza on southern Israel which traumatized Israeli children, calling on all parties to protect children.\n\nNew Zealand ratified the Convention on 6 April 1993 with reservations concerning the right to distinguish between persons according to the nature of their authority to be in New Zealand, the need for legislative action on economic exploitation—which it argued was adequately protected by existing law, and the provisions for the separation of juvenile offenders from adult offenders.\n\nIn 1994, the Court of Appeal of New Zealand dismissed the suggestion that the Minister for Immigration and his department were at liberty to ignore the convention, arguing that this would imply that the country's adherence was \"at least partly window-dressing\".\n\nThe Children's Commissioner Act 2003 enhanced the office of Children's Commissioner, giving it significantly stronger investigative powers. The Office of the Children's Commissioner is responsible for convening the UNCROC Monitoring Group, which monitors the New Zealand Government's implementation of the Children's Convention, it's Optional Protocols and the Government's response to recommendations from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. The monitoring group comprises members from the Human Rights Commission (New Zealand), UNICEF New Zealand, Action for Children and Youth Aotearoa and Save the Children New Zealand.\n\nIn May 2007, New Zealand passed the Crimes (Substituted Section 59) Amendment Act 2007, which removed the defence of \"reasonable force\" for the purpose of correction. In its third and final vote, Parliament voted 113 to eight in favour of the legislation.\n\nSaudi Arabia ratified the Convention in 1996, with a reservation \"with respect to all such articles as are in conflict with the provisions of Islamic law\" which is the national law. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, which reviewed Saudi Arabia's treatment of children under the Convention in January 2005, strongly condemned the government for its practice of imposing the death penalty on juveniles, calling it \"a serious violation of the fundamental rights\". The committee said it was \"deeply alarmed\" over the discretionary power judges hold to treat juveniles as adults: In its 2004 report the Saudi Arabian government had stated that it \"never imposes capital punishment on persons ... below the age of 18\". The government delegation later acknowledged that a judge could impose the death penalty whenever he decided that the convicted person had reached his or her majority, regardless of the person's actual age at the time of the crime or at the time of the scheduled execution.\n\nThe United Kingdom ratified the Convention on 16 December 1991, with several declarations and reservations, and made its first report to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in January 1995. Concerns raised by the Committee included the growth in child poverty and inequality, the extent of violence towards children, the use of custody for young offenders, the low age of criminal responsibility, and the lack of opportunities for children and young people to express views. The 2002 report of the Committee expressed similar concerns, including the welfare of children in custody, unequal treatment of asylum seekers, and the negative impact of poverty on children's rights. In September 2008, the UK government decided to withdraw its reservations and agree to the Convention in these respects.\n\nThe 2002 report's criticism of the legal defence of \"reasonable chastisement\" of children by parents, which the Committee described as \"a serious violation of the dignity of the child\", was rejected by the UK Government. The Minister for Children, Young People and Families commented that while fewer parents are using smacking as a form of discipline, the majority said they would not support a ban.\n\nIn evidence to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Committee was criticised by the Family Education Trust for \"adopting radical interpretations of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in its pursuit of an agenda\". The Joint Committee's report recommended that \"the time has come for the Government to act upon the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child concerning the corporal punishment of children and the incompatibility of the defence of reasonable chastisement with its obligations under the Convention.\" The UK Government responded that \"the use of physical punishment is a matter for individual parents to decide\".\n\nAlthough child slavery is difficult to gauge within the UK, child slaves are imported into the UK and sold.\n\nThe United States government played an active role in the drafting of the Convention and signed it on 16 February 1995, but has not ratified it. It has been claimed that American opposition to the Convention stems primarily from political and religious conservatives. For example, The Heritage Foundation sees \"a civil society in which moral authority is exercised by religious congregations, family, and other private associations is fundamental to the American order\". and the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) argues that the CRC threatens homeschooling.\n\nThe United States had permitted the execution and life imprisonment of juvenile offenders, in contravention of the Article 37 of the Convention. In 2005, a Supreme Court decision declared juvenile executions to be unconstitutional as \"cruel and unusual punishment\"; in 2012, the Court held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders.\n\nState laws regarding the practice of closed adoption may also require overhaul in light of the Convention's position that children have a right to identity from birth.\n\nDuring his 2008 campaign for President, Senator Barack Obama described the failure to ratify the Convention as \"embarrassing\" and promised to review the issue but he never did. No President of the United States has submitted the treaty to the United States Senate requesting its advice and consent to ratification since the US signed it in 1995.\n\nThe United States has ratified two of the optional protocols to the Convention, the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.\n\nTwo optional protocols were adopted by the UN General Assembly. The first, the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict requires parties to ensure that children under the age of 18 are not recruited compulsorily into their armed forces, and calls on governments to do everything feasible to ensure that members of their armed forces who are under 18 years do not take part in hostilities. This protocol entered into force on 12 July 2002. As of , 167 states are party to the protocol and another 14 states have signed but not ratified it.\n\nThe second, the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, requires parties to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. It entered into force on 18 January 2002. As of , 173 states are party to the protocol and another 9 states have signed but not ratified it.\n\nA third, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a Communications Procedure, which would allow children or their representatives to file individual complaints for violation of the rights of children, was adopted in December 2011 and opened for signature on 28 February 2012. The protocol currently has 51 signatures and 45 ratifications: it entered into force on 14 April 2014 following the tenth ratification three months beforehand.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31644249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31644249", "title": "Decline effect", "text": "Decline effect\n\nThe decline effect may occur when scientific claims receive decreasing support over time. The term was first described by parapsychologist Joseph Banks Rhine in the 1930s to describe the disappearing of extrasensory perception (ESP) of psychic experiments conducted by Rhine over the course of study or time. In its more general term, Cronbach, in his review article of science \"Beyond the two disciplines of scientific psychology\" referred to the phenomenon as \"generalizations decay.\" The term was once again used in a 2010 article by Jonah Lehrer published in \"The New Yorker\".\n\nIn his article, Lehrer gives several examples where the decline effect is allegedly showing. In the first example, the development of second generation anti-psychotic drugs, reveals that the first tests had demonstrated a dramatic decrease in the subjects' psychiatric symptoms. However, after repeating tests this effect declined and in the end it was not possible to document that these drugs had any better effect than the first generation anti-psychotics.\n\nA well-known example of the decline effect can be seen in early experiments conducted by Professor Jonathan Schooler examining the effects of verbalization on non-verbal cognition. In an initial series of studies Schooler found evidence that verbal rehearsal of previously seen faces or colors markedly impaired subsequent recognition. This phenomenon is referred to as \"verbal overshadowing\". Although verbal overshadowing effects have been repeatedly observed by Schooler, as well as other researchers, they have also proven to be somewhat challenging to replicate. Verbal overshadowing effects in a variety of domains were initially easy to find, but then became increasingly difficult to replicate indicating a decline effect in the phenomenon. Schooler has now become one of the more prominent researchers examining the decline effect. He has argued that addressing the decline effect may require a major revision to the scientific process whereby scientists log their protocols before conducting their research and then, regardless of outcome, report their findings in an open access repository (such as Brain Nosek's \"Project Implicit\"). Schooler is currently working with the Fetzer Foundation to organize a major meeting of scientists from various disciplines to consider alternative accounts of the decline effect and approaches for rigorously addressing it.\n\nIn 1991, Danish zoologist Anders Møller discovered a connection between symmetry and sexual preference of female birds in nature. This sparked a huge interest in the topic and a lot of follow-up research was published. In three years following the original discovery, 90% of studies confirmed Møller's hypothesis. However, the same outcome was published in just four out of eight research papers in 1995, and only a third in next three years.\n\nOne of the explanations of the effect is regression toward the mean (this is a statistical phenomenon happening when a variable is extreme on the first experiments and by later experiments tend to regress towards average), although this does not explain why sequential results decline in a linear fashion, rather than fluctuating about the true mean as would be expected.\n\nAnother reason may be the publication bias: scientists and scientific journals prefer to publish positive results of experiments and tests over null results, especially with new ideas. As a result, the journals may refuse to publish papers that do not prove that the idea works. Later, when an idea is accepted, journals may refuse to publish papers that support it.\n\nIn the debate that followed the original article, Lehrer answered some of the questions by claiming that scientific observations might be shaped by one's expectations and desires, sometimes even unconsciously, thus creating a bias towards the desired outcome.\n\nA significant factor contributing to the decline effect can also be the sample size of the scientific research, since smaller sample size is very likely to give more extreme results, suggesting a significant breakthrough, but also a higher probability of an error. Typical examples of this effect are the opinion polls, where those including a larger number of people are closer to reality than those with a small pool of respondents. This suggestion would not appear to account for the observed decrease over time regardless of sample size. Researcher John Ioannidis offers some explanation. He states that early research is usually small and more prone to highly positive results supporting the original idea, including early confirmatory studies. Later, as larger studies are being made, they often show regression to the mean and a failure to repeat the early exaggerated results.\n\nA 2012 report by National Public Radio's show \"On The Media\" covered scientists who are exploring another option: that the act of observing the universe changes the universe, and that repeated measurement might actually be rendering earlier results invalid. In other words, antipsychotic drugs \"did\" work originally, but the more we measured their effectiveness, the more the laws governing those drugs changed so they ceased to be effective. Science fiction author Geoff Ryman explores this idea and its possible ramifications further in his 2012 short story What We Found, which won the Nebula Award for Best Novelette in 2012.\n\nSeveral commenters have contested Jonah Lehrer's view of the decline effect being a problematic side of the phenomenon, as presented in his \"New Yorker\" article. \"The decline effect is troubling because it reminds us how difficult it is to prove anything. We like to pretend that our experiments define the truth for us. But that's often not the case. Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe.\" \n\nSteven Novella also challenges Lehrer's view of the decline effect, arguing that Lehrer is concentrating on new discoveries on the cutting edge of scientific research and applying the conclusions to all areas of science. Novella points out that most of the examples used by Lehrer come from medicine, psychology and ecology, scientific fields most influenced by a complex human aspect and that there is not much evidence of the decline effect in other areas of science, such as physics.\n\nAnother scientist, Paul Zachary Myers, is also contesting Lehrer's view on the decline effect being a surprising phenomenon in science, claiming that: \"This isn't surprising at all. It's what we expect, and there are many very good reasons for the shift.\" \n\nLehrer's statements about the difficulty of proving anything and publication bias find support from Jerry A. Coyne. Coyne holds that in the fields of genetics and evolutionary biology, almost no research is replicated and there is a premium motivation offered for publishing positive results of research studies. However, he also contests Lehrer's approach of applying conclusions on all fields of science, stating that in physics, chemistry or molecular biology, previous results are constantly repeated by others in order to progress in their own research.\n\nOne concern that some have expressed is that Lehrer's article may further fuel people's skepticism about academic science. It was long believed that Lehrer's article originally hinted that academic science is not as rigid as people would like to believe. It is especially the article's ending that has upset many scientists and led to broad criticism of the article. Lehrer ends the article by saying: \"Just because an idea is true doesn't mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn't mean it's true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe.\" This has upset scientists in the scientific community. Many have written back to Lehrer and questioned his agenda. Some have characterized Lehrer's assertion as \"absurd\", while others claiming that Lehrer is trying to use publication bias as an excuse for not believing in anything.\n\nAs an answer to the many comments Lehrer received upon publishing the article, Lehrer published a comment on his blog, The Frontal Cortex, where he denied that he was implicitly questioning science and scientific methods in any way. In the same blog comment, Lehrer stated that he was not questioning fundamental scientific theories such as the theory of evolution by natural selection and global warming by calling them \"two of the most robust and widely tested theories of modern science\".\n\nA further clarification was published as a follow-up note in \"The New Yorker\". In this note, entitled \"More Thoughts on the Decline Effect\", Lehrer tries mainly to answer the critics by giving examples where scientific research has both failed and succeeded. As an example, Lehrer uses Richard Feynman's commencement speech at Caltech in 1974 as a starting point. In his commencement speech, Feynman used Robert Millikan's and Harvey Fletcher's oil drop experiment to measure the charge of an electron to illustrate how selective reporting can bias scientific results. On the other hand, Feynman finds solace in the fact that other scientists will repeat other scientists' experiments and hence, the truth will win out in the end.\n\nLehrer once again uses the follow-up note to deny that his original intention was to support people denying well verified scientific theories such as natural selection and climate change. Instead, he wishes that \"we'd spend more time considering the value of second-generation antipsychotics or the verity of the latest gene-association study\". In the other parts of the follow-up note, Lehrer briefly discusses some of the creative feedback he has received in order to reduce publication bias. He does not give explicit support to any specific idea. The follow-up article ends with Lehrer once again stating that the decline effect is a problem in today's science, but that science will eventually find a tool to deal with the problem.\n\n"}

German-speaking colonists entered the approximately 23,000 km² area of Dobruja around 1840 and left during the relocation of 1940. Dobruja is a historic territory on the west coast of the Black Sea.\n\nThe first of these German settlers came between 1841 and 1856 from the Russian Empire. They were farming families from the neighboring areas of Bessarabia and Cherson, who immigrated because of an economic recession in their home territories. Thirty years later colonists from Swabia also moved into the region. During this period, Dobruja still belonged to the Ottoman Empire and the colonists were subject to colonization regulations from Turkey. Consequently, the Dobrujan Germans were the only ethnic Germans to ever be Turkish subjects without actually moving to Turkey (as did the Bosporus Germans). They contributed to the agricultural development of the fertile steppes.\n\nIn the first years of World War II, the majority of the 16,000 Dobrujan Germans, as well as the Bessarabian and Bukovina Germans, were relocated into Germany. This was done under the motto: \"Heim ins Reich\" (Home into the Empire). The refugees lived temporarily in relocation camps in Austria, but in 1941/1942 they resettled the German occupied eastern territories in Bohemia, Moravia and Poland. At the end of the war, they fled west, and were found as refugees in all four occupation zones in Germany.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "158548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158548", "title": "Earth Day", "text": "Earth Day\n\nEarth Day is an annual event celebrated on April 22. Worldwide, various events are held to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First celebrated in 1970, Earth Day now includes events in more than 193 countries, which are now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network.\n\nOn Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, China, and some 120 other countries. This signing satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.\n\nIn 1969 at a UNESCO Conference in San Francisco, peace activist John McConnell proposed a day to honor the Earth and the concept of peace, to first be celebrated on March 21, 1970, the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. This day of nature's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations. A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach-in first held on April 22, 1970. Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in recognition of his work. While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by Denis Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations.\n\nNumerous communities celebrate Earth Week, an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world faces. In 2017, the March for Science occurred on Earth Day (April 22, 2017) and was followed by the People's Climate Mobilization (April 29, 2017).\n\nOn January 28, 1969, a well drilled by Union Oil Platform A off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out. More than three million gallons of oil spewed, killing over 10,000 seabirds, dolphins, seals, and sea lions. As a reaction to this natural disaster, activists were mobilized to create environmental regulation, environmental education, and Earth Day. Among the proponents of Earth Day were the people in the front lines of fighting this disaster, Selma Rubin, Marc McGinnes, and Bud Bottoms, founder of Get Oil Out. Denis Hayes, organizer of Earth Day observance day, said that Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin was inspired to create Earth Day upon seeing Santa Barbara Channel 800 square-mile oil slick from an airplane.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the oil blowout, January 28, 1970, Environmental Rights Day is celebrated, where the Declaration of Environmental Rights is read. It had been written by Rod Nash during a boat trip across the Santa Barbara Channel while carrying a copy of Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.\nThe organizers of Environmental Rights Day, led by Marc McGinnes, had been working closely over a period of several months with Congressman Pete McCloskey (R-CA) to consult on the creation of the National Environmental Policy Act, the first of many new environmental protection laws sparked by the national outcry about the blowout/oil spill and on the Declaration of Environmental Rights. Both McCloskey (Earth Day co-chair with Senator Gaylord Nelson) and Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes, along with Senator Alan Cranston, Paul Ehrlich, David Brower and other prominent leaders, endorsed the Declaration and spoke about it at the Environmental Rights Day conference. According to Francis Sarguis, \"the conference was sort of like the baptism for the movement.\" According to Hayes, this was the first giant crowd he spoke to that \"felt passionately, I mean really passionately, about environmental issues.\" Hayes also thought the conference might be the beginning of a real movement\nNash, Garrett Hardin, McGinnes and others went on to develop the first undergraduate Environmental Studies program of its kind at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nThe first Earth Day celebrations took place in two thousand colleges and universities, roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools, and hundreds of communities across the United States. More importantly, it \"brought 20 million Americans out into the spring sunshine for peaceful demonstrations in favor of environmental reform.\" It now is observed in 192 countries, and coordinated by the nonprofit Earth Day Network, chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organizer Denis Hayes, according to whom Earth Day is now \"the largest secular holiday in the world, celebrated by more than a billion people every year.\" Walt Kelly created an anti-pollution poster featuring his comic strip character Pogo with the quotation \"We have met the enemy and he is us\" to promote the 1970 Earth Day. Environmental groups have sought to make Earth Day into a day of action to change human behavior and provoke policy changes.\n\nIn the winter of 1969–1970, a group of students met at Columbia University to hear Denis Hayes talk about his plans for Earth Day. Among the group were Fred Kent, Pete Grannis, and Kristin and William Hubbard. This group agreed to head up the New York City activities within the national movement. Fred Kent took the lead in renting an office and recruiting volunteers. \"The big break came when Mayor Lindsay agreed to shut down Fifth Avenue for the event. A giant cheer went up in the office on that day,\" according to Kristin Hubbard (now Kristin Alexandre). 'From that time on we used Mayor Lindsay's offices and even his staff. I was Speaker Coordinator but had tremendous help from Lindsay staffer Judith Crichton.\"\n\nIn addition to shutting down Fifth Avenue, Mayor John Lindsay made Central Park available for Earth Day. In Union Square, \"New York Times\" estimated crowds of up to 20,000 people at any given time and, perhaps, as many as over 100,000 over the course of the day. Since Manhattan was also the home of NBC, CBS, ABC, \"The New York Times\", \"Time\", and \"Newsweek\", it provided the best possible anchor for national coverage from their reporters throughout the country.\n\nU.S. Senator Edmund Muskie was the keynote speaker on Earth Day in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. Other notable attendees included consumer protection activist and presidential candidate Ralph Nader; Landscape Architect Ian McHarg; Nobel prize-winning Harvard Biochemist, George Wald; U.S. Senate Minority Leader, Hugh Scott; and poet, Allen Ginsberg.\n\nMobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of environmental issues onto the world stage, Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970, this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing tools, greater access to television and radio, and multimillion-dollar budgets.\n\nTwo separate groups formed to sponsor Earth Day events in 1990: The Earth Day 20 Foundation, assembled by Edward Furia (Project Director of Earth Week in 1970), and Earth Day 1990, assembled by Denis Hayes (National Coordinator for Earth Day 1970). Senator Gaylord Nelson, the original founder of Earth Day, was honorary chairman for both groups. The two did not combine forces over disagreements about leadership of combined organization and incompatible structures and strategies. Among the disagreements, key Earth Day 20 Foundation organizers were critical of Earth Day 1990 for including on their board Hewlett-Packard, a company that at the time was the second-biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in Silicon Valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents. In terms of marketing, Earth Day 20 had a grassroots approach to organizing and relied largely on locally based groups like the National Toxics Campaign, a Boston-based coalition of 1,000 local groups concerned with industrial pollution. Earth Day 1990 employed strategies including focus group testing, direct mail fund raising, and email marketing.\n\nThe Earth Day 20 Foundation highlighted its April 22 activities in George, Washington, near the Columbia River with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb who called from their base camp on Mount Everest to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues. The Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb was led by Jim Whittaker, the first American to summit Mt. Everest (many years earlier), and marked the first time in history that mountaineers from the United States, Soviet Union, and China had roped together to climb a mountain, let alone Mt. Everest. The group also collected more than two tons of trash (transported down the mountain by support groups along the way) that was left behind on Mount Everest from previous climbing expeditions. The master of ceremonies for the Columbia Gorge event was the TV star, John Ratzenberger, from \"Cheers\", and the headlining musician was the \"Father of Rock and Roll,\" Chuck Berry.\n\nWarner Bros. Records released an Earth Day-themed single in 1990 entitled \"Tomorrow's World\", written by Kix Brooks (who would later become one-half of Brooks & Dunn) and Pam Tillis. The song featured vocals from Lynn Anderson, Butch Baker, Shane Barmby, Billy Hill, Suzy Bogguss, Kix Brooks, T. Graham Brown, The Burch Sisters, Holly Dunn, Foster & Lloyd, Vince Gill, William Lee Golden, Highway 101, Shelby Lynne, Johnny Rodriguez, Dan Seals, Les Taylor, Pam Tillis, Mac Wiseman, and Kevin Welch. It charted at number 74 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated May 5, 1990.\n\nEarth Day 2000 combined the ambitious spirit of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. This was the first year that Earth Day used the Internet as its principal organizing tool, and it proved invaluable nationally and internationally. Kelly Evans, a professional political organizer, served as executive director of the 2000 campaign. The event ultimately enlisted more than 5,000 environmental groups outside the United States, reaching hundreds of millions of people in a record 183 countries. Leonardo DiCaprio was the official host for the event, and about 400,000 participants stood in the cold rain during the course of the day.\n\nTo turn Earth Day into a sustainable annual event rather than one that occurred every 10 years, Nelson and Bruce Anderson, New Hampshire's lead organizers in 1990, formed Earth Day USA. Building on the momentum created by thousands of community organizers around the world, Earth Day USA coordinated the next five Earth Day celebrations through 1995, including the launch of EarthDay.org. Following the 25th Anniversary in 1995, the coordination baton was handed to Earth Day Network.\n\nAs the millennium approached, Hayes agreed to spearhead another campaign, this time focusing on global warming and pushing for clean energy. The April 22 Earth Day in 2000 combined the big-picture feistiness of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. For 2000, Earth Day had the internet to help link activists around the world. By the time April 22 came around, 5,000 environmental groups around the world were on board reaching out to hundreds of millions of people in a record 184 countries. Events varied: A talking drum chain traveled from village to village in Gabon, Africa, for example, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., USA.\n\nEarth Day 2007 was one of the largest Earth Days to date, with many people participating in the activities in thousands of places including Kiev, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; Tuvalu; Manila, Philippines; Togo; Madrid, Spain; London; and New York.\n\nFor Earth Day 2017, the Earth Day Network created four toolkits to aid organizations wanting to hold teach-ins to celebrate the theme \"Environmental and Climate Literacy.\" The four toolkits are:\n2017 also saw the Earth Day Network co-organize the March for Science rally and teach-in at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to Nelson, the moniker \"Earth Day\" was \"an obvious and logical name\" suggested by a lot of other people in the fall of 1969, including, he writes, both \"a friend of mine who had been in the field of public relations\" and \"a New York advertising executive,\" Julian Koenig. Koenig, who had been on Nelson's organizing committee in 1969, has said that the idea came to him by the coincidence of his birthday with the day selected, April 22; \"Earth Day\" rhyming with \"birthday,\" the connection seemed natural. Other names circulated during preparations—Nelson himself continued to call it the National Environment Teach-In, but national coordinator Denis Hayes used the term Earth Day in his communications and press coverage of the event was \"practically unanimous\" in its use of \"Earth Day,\" so the name stuck. The introduction of the name \"Earth Day\" was also claimed by John McConnell (see \"Equinox Earth Day,\" below).\n\nThe first Canadian Earth Day was held on Thursday, September 11, 1980, and was organized by Paul D. Tinari, then a graduate student in Engineering Physics/Solar Engineering at Queen's University. Flora MacDonald, then MP for Kingston and the Islands and former Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, officially opened Earth Day Week on September 6, 1980 with a ceremonial tree planting and encouraged MPs and MPPs across the country to declare a cross-Canada annual Earth Day. The principal activities taking place on the first Earth Day included educational lectures given by experts in various environmental fields, garbage and litter pick-up by students along city roads and highways as well as tree plantings to replace the trees killed by Dutch Elm Disease.\n\nThe equinoctial Earth Day is celebrated on the March equinox (around March 20) to mark the precise moment of astronomical spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and of astronomical autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. An equinox in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the equinoxes and solstices are considered to start or separate the seasons.\n\nJohn McConnell first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 UNESCO Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day proclamation was issued by San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General U Thant supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n\nMay there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful Spaceship Earth as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.\nUnited Nations secretary-general Kurt Waldheim observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). Margaret Mead added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n\n\"Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way – which is also the most ancient way – by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.\"\n\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the Japanese Peace Bell, which was donated by Japan to the United Nations. Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration. On March 20, 2008, in addition to the ceremony at the United Nations, ceremonies were held in New Zealand, and bells were sounded in California, Vienna, Paris, Lithuania, Tokyo, and many other locations. The equinox Earth Day at the UN is organized by the Earth Society Foundation.\n\nEarth Day ringing the peace bell is celebrated around the world in many towns, ringing the Peace Bell in Vienna, Berlin, and elsewhere. A memorable event took place at the UN in Geneva, celebrating a Minute for Peace ringing the Japanese Shinagawa Peace Bell with the help of the Geneva Friendship Association and the Global Youth Foundation, directly after in deep mourning about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe 10 days before.\n\nBeside the Spring Equinox for the Northern Hemisphere, the observance of the Spring Equinox for the Southern Hemisphere in September is of equal importance. The International Day of Peace is celebrated on September 21, and can thus be considered to accord with the original intentions of John McConnell, U Thant and others.\n\nIn 1968, Morton Hilbert and the U.S. Public Health Service organized the Human Ecology Symposium, an environmental conference for students to hear from scientists about the effects of environmental degradation on human health. This was the beginning of Earth Day. For the next two years, Hilbert and students worked to plan the first Earth Day. In April 1970—along with a federal proclamation from U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson—the first Earth Day was held.\n\nProject Survival, an early environmentalism-awareness education event, was held at Northwestern University on January 23, 1970. This was the first of several events held at university campuses across the United States in the lead-up to the first Earth Day. Also, Ralph Nader began talking about the importance of ecology in 1970.\n\nThe 1960s had been a very dynamic period for ecology in the US. Pre-1960 grassroots activism against DDT in Nassau County, New York, and widespread opposition to open-air nuclear weapons tests with their global nuclear fallout, had inspired Rachel Carson to write her influential bestseller, \"Silent Spring\" (1962).\n\nNelson chose the date in order to maximize participation on college campuses for what he conceived as an \"environmental teach-in\". He determined the week of April 19–25 was the best bet as it did not fall during exams or spring breaks. Moreover, it did not conflict with religious holidays such as Easter or Passover, and was late enough in spring to have decent weather. More students were likely to be in class, and there would be less competition with other mid-week events—so he chose Wednesday, April 22. The day also fell after the anniversary of the birth of noted conservationist John Muir. The National Park Service, John Muir National Historic Site, has a celebration every year on or around Earth Day (April 21, 22 or 23), called Birthday-Earth Day, in recognition of Earth Day and John Muir's contribution to the collective consciousness of environmentalism and conservation.\n\nUnbeknownst to Nelson, April 22, 1970, was coincidentally the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin, when translated to the Gregorian calendar (which the Soviets adopted in 1918). \"Time\" reported that some suspected the date was not a coincidence, but a clue that the event was \"a Communist trick\", and quoted a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution as saying, \"subversive elements plan to make American children live in an environment that is good for them.\" J. Edgar Hoover, director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, may have found the Lenin connection intriguing; it was alleged the FBI conducted surveillance at the 1970 demonstrations. The idea that the date was chosen to celebrate Lenin's centenary still persists in some quarters, an idea borne out by the similarity with the subbotnik instituted by Lenin in 1920 as days on which people would have to do community service, which typically consisted in removing rubbish from public property and collecting recyclable material. Subbotniks were also imposed on other countries within the compass of Soviet power, including Eastern Europe, and at the height of its power the Soviet Union established a nationwide subbotnik to be celebrated on Lenin's birthday, April 22, which had been proclaimed a national holiday celebrating communism by Nikita Khrushchev in 1955.\n\nThere are many songs that are performed on Earth Day, that generally fall into two categories: popular songs by contemporary artists not specific to Earth Day that are under copyright or new lyrics adapted to children's songs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35016491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35016491", "title": "Ethnic Chinese in Belize", "text": "Ethnic Chinese in Belize\n\nThe Chinese community in Belize consists of descendants of Chinese immigrants who were brought to British Honduras as indentured laborers as well as recent immigrants from China and Taiwan.\n\nThe importation of Chinese workers to British Honduras was a response to economic shifts in the mid-19th century. As logwood and mahogany production declined, sugarcane plantations became of increasing importance. Recruitment of workers from China was facilitated by the colonial governor John Gardiner Austin, who had previously served as a labour broker in Xiamen, Fujian on China's southeast coast. 474 Chinese workers thus arrived in British Honduras in 1865. They were sent to the north of the colony, but were reassigned to central and southern areas beginning in 1866 due to the large numbers of deaths and abscondments. By 1869, only 211 remained accounted for; 108 had died, while another 155 had sought refuge with the native peoples at Chan Santa Cruz. Many of the deaths were due to suicide in response to horrifying working conditions.\n\nMore Chinese laborers migrated to Belize in the early 20th century. The second largest batch came just before the outbreak of World War II, when they traveled to the United States from where they gradually trickled southward by land to Mexico and Central America.\nThe Chinese were originally brought to Belize as Indentured Servants as Slaves.\n\nBelize's citizenship-by-investment programme, which began in 1986, was a popular option among Chinese migrants in the 1990s. In response to the demand, the price rose from US$25,000 to US$50,000 in 1997. Hong Kong migrants, who lacked real British citizenship but only had British National (Overseas) status, sought to obtain Belizean passports as an insurance policy in case conditions in their homeland went downhill after the 1997 resumption of sovereignty by China. Mainland Chinese migrants, for their part, sought to use Belize as a stepping stone to get around tough U.S. migration policy against them; however, the U.S. tightened up its visa requirements for Belizeans in response. Migrants from Taiwan also took advantage of this programme. Among migrants from Taiwan it was especially popular to bring aged relatives to settle in Belize.\n\nNot all of the migrants returned to their homeland or went on to the U.S.; some settled in the Belize River on the tracts of land that the government granted them in exchange for their investments, bringing in workers to building houses and schools. In the mid-1990s there may have been as many as six or seven thousand Chinese people in Belize. However, when the government tightened its work permit policies, an exodus began — the migrants went to other Chinese communities in Costa Rica, Thailand, and the Philippines where migration policies were more favourable. By 1998 the Chinese were estimated to have fallen to about 1.5% of the Belizean population, or three thousand people. Corozal for example was reported to have had a peak Chinese population of 500, but then fell to just one-tenth that.\n\nIn the 19th century, during the Caste War in neighbouring Yucatán, Mexico, Chinese and Lebanese shopkeepers began setting up businesses in Belize City. A hardware store run by a Chinese migrant named Augusto Quan was well known as the only supplier of certain tools, nails, and buckets for a long time. Others established laundries, brothels, gambling houses, Live Draw Xiamen Lottery and restaurants. Today the Chinese community control most of the economy and became dominant in the grocery, restaurant, fast food, and lottery trades.\n\nThe 2000 Census found 1,716 Chinese people (0.7% of the population) living in the country, and 1,607 people speaking Chinese as their first language. Chinese are an overwhelmingly urban population, with five-sixths living in cities, the highest proportion out of all tabulated ethnic groups. This is a slightly higher proportion than Garifuna people and Creoles, but contrasted sharply with East Indians, of whom roughly half live in rural areas. The majority live in Belize City (988 people) and Cayo District wherein lies the capital Belmopan (351 people). Compared to other ethnic groups their median level of education is higher, with 46% having completed secondary education, a proportion second only to Africans and Caucasians, similar to that of Spanish people, and more than double that of Creoles, Garifuna people, East Indians, and other ethnic groups; however, relatively few (12%) go on to tertiary education. Despite efforts to hire Chinese interpreters for the census, the Central Statistical Office indicated in an official report that many Chinese migrants, like other foreign-born persons, did not respond to the census and thus were undercounted. The language barrier may have been compounded by the fact that illegal immigrants' unwillingness to participate in the census for fear that the information they provided could be used for law enforcement; however this may have been ameliorated somewhat by an immigration amnesty in 1999.\n\nThe 2010 Census did not break out Chinese separately, but recorded 2,823 \"Asians\" (a separate category from \"East Indians\").\n\nUnusual naming customs arose among Chinese people in Belize. Indentured migrants were assigned identifying numbers, which were sometimes used in place of names. Workers sometimes traded numbers or misused numbers of deceased fellows to obtain extra rations. After they had filled their indenture contracts, they had to register their own names. Some used approximations of their Chinese names, some took on English given names while keeping Chinese surnames, while others (especially those who had remigrated from Guatemala) had Spanish translations of their Chinese surnames.\n\nThe most important festival for the Chinese community is Lunar New Year, which falls on the first day of the first lunar month. Lion dances, accompanied by cymbals, drums, gongs, and firecrackers are a common sight during these festivities.\n\nFor a majority of the Chinese, religion is a mixture of all the various Chinese philosophies. The older generation, especially the women, continue to practice an abbreviated form of ancestor worship and Buddhism, while most of their children born in Belize have adopted Catholicism consequent upon their Catholic education.\n\nCommunity organisations include the Belize Chinese Association, which conducts Chinese New Year gatherings. Its former president Lee Mark Chang has also been active in speaking out against crime committed against Chinese businesspeople, and responding to accusations that the businesspeople themselves bear responsibility for the crime because they do not provide employment opportunities to local people. In 2010, the BCA organised a nationwide shutdown of Chinese shops in response to the murder of 14-year-old Hellen Yu, a local-born girl of Chinese descent, during a robbery of her parents shop; BCA secretary Eric Chang expressed disappointment at other Belizeans' indifference to the murder. In 2011, the BCA and the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce organised joint street protests in response to the murder of two Chinese women. New BCA president Edmund Quan was quoted as stating that his organisation would submit requests to the authorities for amendments of relevant criminal laws.\n\nRacism in Belize is directed by Belizean Creole people against both the indigenous Maya people of Belize as well as recent migrants such as the Chinese. Along with mestizos, Chinese, as a visible minority, are highly vulnerable to being targeted for exclusion from society. Chinese themselves are often reluctant to integrate into local society, preferring to maintain their own institutions and social circles. The prevalence of robberies against Chinese shopkeepers has also contributed to poor relations between Chinese and Creoles; many of these robberies are believed to be committed by Creole gangs. Even the iron window bars which Chinese merchants use to protect their businesses from burglary are seen as a symbol of their desire to remain aloof from Belizean society. Resentment at the commercial success of Asians (both East Indians and Chinese) is also widespread, especially because they run family businesses which rarely offer employment opportunities to outsiders. Few learn to speak the Belizean Kriol language. Chinese people's extensive use of the economic citizenship programme has also proven to be controversial among local people.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47184946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47184946", "title": "Filipinos of Malay descent", "text": "Filipinos of Malay descent\n\nMalays played a role in pre-Hispanic Philippine history. Malay involvement in Philippine history goes back to the Classical Era with the establishment of Rajahnates as well as the Islamic era, in which various sultanates and Islamic states were formed in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago.\n\nMalays made large contribution to Philippine history, and influenced modern-day lifestyles of Filipinos. The Malay language was the lingua franca of the archipelago prior to Spanish rule. Due to the religious history of the Malay Archipelago, many of these historical rulers also contained a mix of Arab or Indian ancestry in addition to their Malay descent.\n\nThe Philippines doesn't have a significant ethnic Malay population today, and most if any, descendants of Malays have been assimilated into the general culture, characterized by Spanish influence and Roman Catholicism. Malay influence is still strong in the culturally conservative regions of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, whose' people actually reject being called \"Filipino\", and to some extent, in Visayas as well where much Malay involvement came during the classical era. These three island groups are where most Filipinos of Malay descent live.\n\nIn the modern-day, the closest population to Malays are the Moro people, the native Muslim population of the Philippines that inhabit Mindanao, Sulu Archipelago, parts of Visayas and the Quiapo district in Manila. They follow a culture and lifestyle similar to Malays.\n\nThere is an often a lot of confusion in the Philippines between \"ethnic Malays\" and \"Malay race\", a term coined for brown-skinned Austronesian natives of not only the Philippines, but also of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and southern Thailand. The country had its own Malay nationalism, un-associated with the anti-colonial struggle in the British and Dutch East Indies. The Philippine nationalism occurred albeit the end of Spanish occupation and spearheaded by José Rizal. Unlike the Malay nationalism and \"Malayness\" in Indonesia and Malaysia which was defined by Islam as well as being of the ethnic group, Rizal's movement was that of a secular vision to unify the natives of the Malay Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula, believing them to have falsely been divided by colonial powers.\n\nInteraction between the natives of the Philippines and the Malay Srivijaya Kingdom (as well as the Javanese kingdoms of Majapahit and Medang) are recorded by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, which dates approximately 900 A.D. This steel plate was written in a mix of Old Tagalog, Old Malay and Javanese. Among the Malays, the classical Philippine kingdoms also interacted with other native peoples of Indonesia, including the Minangkabau and Javanese.\n\nThe first-recorded Malay in Philippine history was Sri Lumay, although accounts him are mostly in Visayan folklore. Sri Lumay was born in Sumatra, an island in Indonesia with a high Malay-population, and was of mixed Malay and Tamil descent. He settled in somewhere in modern-day Visayas. Sri Lumay established the Rajahnate of Cebu. His sons also ruled nearby regions and kingdoms.\n\nThe name \"Visayas\" originates from the name \"Srivijaya\", the name of the aforementioned ancient Malay kingdom of the same that was centered in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nUpon the Islamization of the southern Philippines, Sri Lumay was known to have resisted the Islamic expansion, and enacted a scorched-earth policy for the Moro raiders.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Islamization of the Alam Melayu (literally \"Malay realm\") was near-complete and its influence had spilled into the Philippines. Sharif Kabungsuwan, a native of Johore migrated to Mindanao where he preached Islam to the inland natives - and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao. His descendants provided Mindanao with a fierce resistance to Spanish occupation, one of his descendants, Muhammad Dipaduan Kudarat is known as a national hero in the Philippines.\n\nThe late 15th century and through 1521 is filled with preachers of Islam, particularly Malays, along with Arabs, Chinese Muslim and Indian Muslims spreading Islam in the southern Philippines. During the reign of Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei, the Bruneian armies attacked the Kingdom of Tondo and established the Kingdom of Selurong, or Seludong where modern-day Manila is located. This was a Bruneian satellite state, and was placed under the rule of Rajah Sulayman, a native Muslim from the Manila area.\n\nRajah Sulayman came from a long line of rulers, of mixed Tagalog and Malay descent. His grandfather for example, Salila, was a descendant of the Bolkiah family from Brunei.\n\nIn 1521, Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Visayas where he encountered Rajah Humabon, one of Sri Lumay's descendants. Humabon accepted Roman Catholicism, and urged his rival Lapu-Lapu to allow Europeans. Magellan used his Malay servant, Enrique of Malacca to converse with the natives. Magellan and Enrique both perished in the Battle of Mactan.\n\nThroughout the 300 years of Spanish colonization, any sort of Malay identity was lost in assimilation, even in the Muslim south where Arabic was the favored and promoted language over Malay. José Rizal, an avid pan-Malayan nationalist spearheaded a movement to \"re-unite\" the natives of the archipelago with that of its southern neighbors in what would today become the countries of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and Thailand.\n\nThis type of \"Malayan\" movement was significantly different than the one that took place in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. While those movements were focused on the lone ethnic group originating from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, Rizal envisioned a larger pan-Austronesian nation, what would later become coined as the Malay race. Rizal's movement was known as the \"Indios Bravos\", (\"Brave Indians\"). Rizal had actually tried to learn Malay, but he was executed in 1896, therefore never getting a chance to fully revive the Malay language in the Philippines.\n\nWenceslao Vinzons, a Filipino politician and guerrilla leader during World War II, was another noted pan-Malayan nationalist. He found the \"Perhimpoenan Orang Melayu\" (\"Pan Malay Alliance\") at the University of the Philippines.\n\nIt is for this reason that definition of \"Malay\" in the Philippines differ from that of its southern neighbors, therefore making it difficult to get an accurate estimate of who contains descent from the actual ethnic group. As for \"Malay race\", this would cover approximately 90,000,000 natives in the Philippines.\n\nHistorically, the Malays in the Philippines followed the religious trend of Maritime Southeast Asia. They followed a mix of Animism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Paganism. They introduced cultural influence from the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nIn the late 15th century through the 16th century, the Islamisation of the Malay realm also influenced the Philippines, and the Malays introduced Islam. Sharif Kabungsuwan, a Johor-born native of Malay and Arab descent introduced Islam. Rajah Sulayman, the ruler of Seludong, was a Muslim convert.\n\nDuring the Spanish occupation, the overwhelming majority were converted to Christianity, Roman Catholicism to be specific. Enrique of Malacca, a Malaccan Malay who accompanied the Portuguese conquistador Ferdinand Magellan to Cebu, was a convert to Roman Catholicism, though he wasn't converted in the Philippines and was already a Catholic convert upon arrival. Rajah Humabon, a descendant of Sri Lumay, as well as Lakan Dula of Tondo, both converted to Catholicism and were given the names \"Carlos\".\n\nIt is understood in Malaysia and Indonesia that Malays, as in the ethnic group, are those who speak Malay a native language. In Indonesia, Malay and Indonesian are regarded as two different languages. The Malay race, on the other hand, is not the same as the ethnic group, and simply refers to the Austronesian natives of Maritime Southeast Asia. Though the ethnic Malays are part of the bigger Malay Race.\n\nIn the Philippines, there is misconception and often mixing between the two definitions. Filipinos consider Malays as being the natives of the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Consequently, Filipinos consider themselves Malay when in reality, they are referring to the Malay Race. Filipinos in Singapore also prefer to be considered Malay, but their desire to be labeled as part of the ethnic group was rejected by the Singaporean government. Paradoxically, a minor percentage of Filipinos prefer the Spanish influence and may associate themselves with being Hispanic, and have made no realistic attempts to promote and/or revive the Malay language in the Philippines.\n\nThis leads to misconceptions about the ancient rulers of the Philippines. Lapu-Lapu for example was thought to be a Malay Muslim, though he was ethnically Cebuano and his religious background is obscure. Though the Bangsamoro follows a Malay-influenced culture, they are also mistakenly called Malays by the majority of Christian Filipinos.\n\nJosé Rizal, the Philippines' most regarded national hero is often called the \"Pride of the Malay Race\". This gave rise to a political concept known as Maphilindo, a proposed confederation that would consist of Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. With the creation of ASEAN, this proposal never manifested.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16803252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16803252", "title": "Green national product", "text": "Green national product\n\nThere is a criticism of the gross national product. The criticism stems from the fact that this measurement of national product does not account for environmental degradation and resource depletion. A new approach to the situation of allocating these omitted environmental features in the national product has been the advent of the green national product.\n\nThe gross national product (GNP) measures the welfare of a nation's economy through the aggregate of products and services produced in that nation. Although GNP is a proficient measurement of the magnitude of the economy, many economists, environmentalists and citizens have been arguing the validity of the GNP in respect to measuring welfare. Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize–winning economist, states that this standard measurement for any national economy has become deficient as a measure of long-term economic health in our recently resource-driven and globalizing world. Critics suggest that GNP often includes the environment on the wrong side of the balance sheet because if someone first pollutes and then another person cleans the pollution, both activities add to GNP making environmental degradation frequently look good for the economy. Critics of mainstream economics complain that GNP compiles spending that makes us worse off, spending that allows us to stay in the same place, and spending that makes us better off all in a single measure, giving a nation no clue if they are making progress or not. Manfred Max-Neef, Chilean economist, explains that politicians feel that it is irrelevant whether the spending is productive, unproductive, or destructive. In this sense, it is common to see political policies that call to depredate a natural resource in order to increase the GNP. To take into account the environmental depredation and resource depletion, there is a call to shift away from the traditional GNP and construct an assessment of national product that takes into account environmental effects.\n\nEver since the Industrial Revolution, scientists and economists have warned of an inflection point for the United States economy where expansion is inevitably limited by the steadily decreasing availability of natural resources. In 1973, William D. Nordhaus and James Tobin, Yale economists, were the first to question the GNP in \"is growth obsolete?\" Nordhaus and Tobin developed a Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW) and stated that welfare must be sustainable, in the sense that nations that devour their stock of capital are not as \"well\" as the national income would suggest.\n\nHowever, in \"The Green National Product\", Clifford Cobb and John Cobb argue that the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to encompass the depletion of natural capital. In 1989, Herman Daly, John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created what is known as the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP. Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income. ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides. Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable. By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will generally enhance welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.\n\nIn 1995, Redefining Progress created the genuine progress indicator (GPI) as an alternative to the traditional GNP. This new measurement of national income would allow policymakers to gauge how well citizens are, economically and socially. Unlike welfare adjustments in the past like MEW and ISEW, GPI adjusts not only for environmental depredation, but also for income distribution, housework, volunteering, crime, changes in leisure time, and life-span of consumer durables and public infrastructure. This was one of the first alternatives to the traditional GNP to be used by the scientific community and governmental organizations globally.\n\nIn 1992, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated intensive work to create an environmental accounting system. The BEA began by creating satellite accounts with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal. The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts (IEESA) in 1994. The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth. Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon Alan Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia's coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 Appropriation Bill. In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in environmental accounting, and to obtain an external review on their findings.\n\nMany people are calling for a green national product that would indicate if activities benefit or harm the economy and well-being. This green national product would revolve around the social and economic issues on which many green movements have focused: care for the earth and all that sustain it. This new national product would differ from the traditional GNP by addressing both the sustainability and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants. It is essential that this system takes into account natural capital, which is currently hidden from our traditional measurement.\n\n"}

Historically, the terms \"Gurkha\" and \"Gorkhali\" were synonymous with \"Nepali\", which originates from the hill principality Gorkha Kingdom, from which the Kingdom of Nepal expanded under Prithivi Narayan Shah. The name may be traced to the medieval Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath who has a historic shrine in Gorkha. The word itself derived from \"Go-Raksha\" (), \"raksha\" becoming \"rakha\" (रखा). \"Rakhawala\" means \"protector\" and is derived from \"raksha\" as well.\n\nEthnically, Gurung, Magar, Kshetriya, Thakuri, Kiranti (Rai people, Limbu, Sunuwar) mainly were the Gorkhali tribes that united the erstwhile Gorkha Kingdom and fought against the British invasions. Today, Gorkhali soldiers belong to the Gurung, Magar, Kiranti (Rai people, Limbu, Sunuwar), Tamang, Newar, Sherpa, Bahun, Chhetri, Thakuri and various ethnic groups in Nepal. There are Gurkha military units in the Nepalese, British and Indian armies enlisted in Nepal, United Kingdom and India. Although they meet many of the requirements of Article 47 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions regarding mercenaries, they are exempt under clauses similarly to the French Foreign Legion.\n\nGurkhas are closely associated with the khukuri, a forward-curving Nepali knife, and have a reputation for fearless military prowess. Former Indian Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw once stated that: \"If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or he is a Gurkha.\"\n\nDuring the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16) between the Gorkha Kingdom (present-day Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal) and the East India Company, the Gorkhali soldiers made an impression on the British, who called them \"Gurkhas\".\n\nThe Anglo-Nepalese war was fought between the Gurkha Kingdom of Nepal and the British East India Company as a result of border disputes and ambitious expansionism of both the belligerent parties. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugauli in 1816.\n\nDavid Ochterlony and British political agent William Fraser were among the first to recognize the potential of Gurkha soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Gurkha army and employ them as irregular forces. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lt. Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the 1st King George’s Own Gurkha Rifles, saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lt. Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\". \n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not just Gorkhalis but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term \"Gurkha\", became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony’s Gurkha battalions, Fraser and Lt. Frederick Young raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles; an additional battalion--the Kumaon--was also raised, eventually becoming the 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\nGurkhas served as troops under contract to the East India Company in the Pindaree War of 1817, in Bharatpur in 1826 and the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars in 1846 and 1848.\n\nDuring the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Gurkhas fought on the British side and became part of the British Indian Army on its formation. The 8th (Sirmoor) Local Battalion made a particularly notable contribution during the conflict, and indeed 25 Indian Order of Merit awards were made to men from that regiment during the Siege of Delhi. \n\nThree days after the mutiny began, the Sirmoor Battalion was ordered to move to Meerut, where the British garrison was barely holding on, and in doing so they had to march up to 48 km a day. Later, during the four-month Siege of Delhi, they defended Hindu Rao's house, losing 327 out of 490 men. During this action they fought side-by-side with the 60th Rifles and a strong bond developed.\n\nTwelve regiments from the Nepalese Army also took part in the relief of Lucknow under the command of Shri Teen (3) Maharaja Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal and his older brother C-in-C Ranodip Singh Kunwar (Ranaudip Singh Bahadur Rana) (later to succeed Jung Bahadur and become Sri Teen Maharaja Ranodip Singh of Nepal).\n\nAfter the rebellion the 60th Rifles pressed for the Sirmoor Battalion to become a rifle regiment. This honor was granted then next year (1858) when the battalion was renamed the Sirmoor Rifle Regiment and awarded a third color. In 1863 Queen Victoria presented the regiment with the Queen's Truncheon, as a replacement for the colors that rifle regiments do not usually have.\n\nFrom the end of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 until the start of World War I, the Gurkha Regiments saw active service in Burma, Afghanistan, the North-East Frontier and the North-West Frontiers of India, Malta (the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78), Cyprus, Malaya, China (the Boxer Rebellion of 1900) and Tibet (Younghusband's Expedition of 1905).\n\nBetween 1901 and 1906, the Gurkha regiments were renumbered from the 1st to the 10th and re-designated as the Gurkha Rifles. In this time the Brigade of Gurkhas, as the regiments came to be collectively known, was expanded to 20 battalions within the ten regiments.\n\nDuring World War I (1914–1918) more than 200,000 Gurkhas served in the British Army, suffering approximately 20,000 casualties and receiving almost 2,000 gallantry awards. The number of Gurkha battalions was increased to 33, and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command by the Gurkha government for service on all fronts. Many Gurkha volunteers served in non-combatant roles, serving in units such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labor battalions.\n\nA large number also served in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia. They served on the battlefields of France in the battles of Loos, Givenchy and Neuve Chapelle; in Belgium at the battle of Ypres; in Mesopotamia, Persia, Suez Canal and Palestine against Turkish advance, Gallipoli and Salonika. One detachment served with Lawrence of Arabia, while during the Battle of Loos (June–December 1915) a battalion of the 8th Gurkhas fought to the last man, hurling themselves time after time against the weight of the German defenses, and in the words of the Indian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir James Willcocks, \"found its Valhalla\". \n\nDuring the ultimately unsuccessful Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, the Gurkhas were among the first to arrive and the last to leave. The 1st/6th Gurkhas, having landed at Cape Helles, led the assault during the first major operation to take out a Turkish high point, and in doing so captured a feature that later became known as \"Gurkha Bluff\". At Sari Bair they were the only troops in the whole campaign to reach and hold the crest line and look down on the Straits, which was the ultimate objective. The 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Gurkha Rifles (2nd/3rd Gurkha Rifles) was involved in the conquest of Baghdad.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, the Gurkhas were returned to India, and during the inter-war years were largely kept away from the internal strife and urban conflicts of the sub-continent, instead being employed largely on the frontiers and in the hills where fiercely independent tribesmen were a constant source of troubles. \n\nAs such, between the World Wars the Gurkha regiments fought in the Third Afghan War in 1919. The regiments then participated in numerous campaigns on the North-West Frontier, mainly in Waziristan, where they were employed as garrison troops defending the frontier. They kept the peace among the local populace and engaged with the lawless and often openly hostile Pathan tribesmen. \n\nDuring this time the North-West Frontier was the scene of considerable political and civil unrest and troops stationed at Razmak, Bannu and Wanna saw an extensive amount of action.\n\nDuring World War II (1939–1945) there were ten Gurkha regiments, with two battalions each, making a total of 20 pre-war battalions. Following the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in 1940, the Nepalese government offered to increase recruitment to enlarge the total number of Gurkha battalions in British service to 35. This would eventually rise to 43 battalions.\n\nIn order to achieve the increased number of battalions, third and fourth battalions were raised for all ten regiments, with fifth battalions also being raised for 1 GR, 2 GR and 9 GR. This expansion required ten training centers to be established for basic training and regimental records across India. In addition, five training battalions (14 GR, 29 GR, 38 GR, 56 GR and 710 GR) were raised, while other units (25 GR and 26 GR) were raised as garrison battalions for keeping the peace in India and defending rear areas. Large numbers of Gurkha men were also recruited for non-Gurkha units, and other specialized functions such as paratroops, signals, engineers and military police.\n\nA total of 250,280 Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight Nepalese Army battalions, parachute, training, garrison and porter units during the war, in almost all theaters. In addition to keeping peace in India, Gurkhas fought in Syria, North Africa, Italy, Greece and against the Japanese in the jungles of Burma, northeast India and also Singapore. They did so with considerable distinction, earning 2,734 bravery awards in the process and suffering around 32,000 casualties in all theaters.\n\nGurkha ranks in the British Indian Army followed the same pattern as those used throughout the rest of the Indian Army at that time. As in the British Army itself, there were three distinct levels: private soldiers, non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers. Commissioned officers within the Gurkha regiments held a \"Viceroy's Commission\", which was distinct from the King's or Queen's Commission that British officers serving with a Gurkha regiment held. Any Gurkha holding a commission was technically subordinate to any British officer, regardless of rank.\n\nViceroy Commissioned Officers (VCOs) up to 1947 and Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) from 1947:\n\nWarrant officers\n\nNon-commissioned officers\n\nPrivate soldiers\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nAfter Indian independence—and the partition of India—in 1947 and under the Tripartite Agreement, the original ten Gurkha regiments consisting of the 20 pre-war battalions were split between the British Army and the newly independent Indian Army. Six Gurkha regiments (12 battalions) were transferred to the post-independence Indian Army, while four regiments (eight battalions) were transferred to the British Army.\n\nTo the disappointment of their British officers, the majority of Gurkhas given a choice between British or Indian Army service opted for the latter. The reason appears to have been the pragmatic one that the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army would continue to serve in their existing roles in familiar territory and under terms and conditions that were well established. The only substantial change was the substitution of Indian officers for British. By contrast, the four regiments selected for British service faced an uncertain future, initially in Malaya—a region where relatively few Gurkhas had previously served. The four regiments (or eight battalions) in British service have since been reduced to a single (two-battalion) regiment, while the Indian units have been expanded beyond their pre-Independence establishment of 12 battalions.\n\nThe principal aim of the Tripartite Agreement was to ensure that Gurkhas serving under the Crown would be paid on the same scale as those serving in the new Indian Army. This was significantly lower than the standard British rates of pay. While the difference is made up through cost of living and location allowances during a Gurkha's actual period of service, the pension payable on his return to Nepal is much lower than would be the case for his British counterparts.\n\nWith the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy, the future recruitment of Gurkhas for British and Indian service was initially put into doubt. A spokesperson for the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which was expected to play a major role in the new secular republic, stated that recruitment as mercenaries was degrading to the Nepalese people and would be banned. However, as of 2018, Gurkha recruitment for foreign service continues.\n\nFour Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army on 1 January 1948:\n\nThey formed the Brigade of Gurkhas and were initially stationed in Malaya. There were also a number of additional Gurkha regiments including the 69th and 70th Gurkha Field Squadrons, both included in the 36th Engineer Regiment. Since then, British Gurkhas have served in Borneo during the confrontation with Indonesia, in the Falklands War and on various peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone, East Timor, Bosnia and Kosovo.\n\nGurkhas in Hong Kong:\n\nAs of July 2018, the \"Brigade of Gurkhas\" in the British Army has the following units:\n\nThe Brigade of Gurkhas also has its own chefs posted among the above-mentioned units. Gurkhas were among the troops who retook the Falklands in 1982 and have served a number of tours of duty in the current War in Afghanistan.\n\nUpon independence in 1947, six of the original ten Gurkha regiments remained with the Indian Army. These regiments were:\n\nAdditionally, a further regiment, 11 Gorkha Rifles, was raised. In 1949 the spelling was changed from \"Gurkha\" to the original \"Gorkha\". All royal titles were dropped when India became a republic in 1950.\n\nSince partition, the Gurkha regiments that were transferred to the Indian Army have established themselves as a permanent and vital part of the newly independent Indian Army. Indeed, while Britain has reduced its Gurkha contingent, India has continued to recruit Gorkhas of Nepal into Gorkha regiments in large numbers, as well as Indian Gorkhas. In 2009 the Indian Army had a Gorkha contingent that numbered around 42,000 men in 46 battalions, spread across seven regiments.\n\nAlthough their deployment is still governed by the 1947 Tripartite Agreement, in the post-1947 conflicts India has fought in, Gorkhas have served in almost all of them, including the wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 1999 and also against China in 1962. They have also been used in peacekeeping operations around the world. They have also served in Sri Lanka conducting operations against the Tamil Tigers.\n\nThe Gurkha Contingent (GC) of the Singapore Police Force was formed on 9 April 1949 from selected ex-British Army Gurkhas. It is an integral part of the police force and was raised to replace a Sikh unit that had existed prior to the Japanese occupation during the Second World War.\n\nThe GC is a well trained, dedicated and disciplined body whose principal role is as riot police. In times of crisis it can be deployed as a reaction force. During the turbulent years before and after independence, the GC acquitted itself well on several occasions during outbreaks of civil disorder. The Gurkhas displayed the courage, self-restraint and professionalism for which they are famous and earned the respect of the society at large.\n\nThe Gurkha Reserve Unit (GRU) is a special guard and elite shock-troop force in the Sultanate of Brunei. The Brunei Reserve Unit employs about 500 Gurkhas. The majority are veterans of the British Army and the Singaporean Police, who have joined the GRU as a second career.\n\nThere have been 26 Victoria Crosses awarded to members of the Gurkha regiments. The first was awarded in 1858 and the last in 1965. For a detailed list of the recipients and their deeds, see the British Ministry of Defence website. Thirteen of the recipients have been British officers serving with Gurkha regiments, although since 1915 the majority have been received by Gurkhas serving in the ranks as private soldiers or NCOs. In addition, since Indian independence in 1947, Gurkhas serving in the Indian Army have also been awarded three Param Vir Chakras, which are roughly equivalent.\n\nOf note also, there have been two George Cross medals awarded to Gurkha soldiers, for acts of bravery in situations that have not involved combat.\n\nThe treatment of Gurkhas and their families was the subject of controversy in the United Kingdom once it became widely known that Gurkhas received smaller pensions than their British counterparts. The nationality status of Gurkhas and their families was also an area of dispute, with claims that some ex-army Nepali families were being denied residency and forced to leave Britain. On 8 March 2007 the British Government announced that all Gurkhas who signed up after 1 July 1997 would receive a pension equivalent to that of their British counterparts. In addition, Gurkhas would, for the first time, be able to transfer to another army unit after five years' service and women would also be allowed to join--although not in first-line units--conforming to the British Army's policy. The act also guaranteed residency rights in Britain for retired Gurkhas and their families.\n\nDespite the changes, many Gurkhas who had not served long enough to entitle them to a pension faced hardship on their return to Nepal, and some critics derided the government's decision to only award the new pension and citizenship entitlement to those joining after 1 July 1997, claiming that this left many ex-Gurkha servicemen still facing a financially uncertain retirement. An advocacy group, Gurkha Justice Campaign, joined the debate in support of the Gurkhas.\n\nIn a landmark ruling on 30 September 2008 the High Court in London decided that the Home Secretary's policy allowing Gurkhas who left the Army before 1997 to apply for settlement in the United Kingdom was irrationally restrictive in its criteria, and overturned it. In line with the ruling of the High Court the Home Office pledged to review all cases affected by this decision.\n\nOn 29 April 2009 a motion in the House of Commons by the Liberal Democrats that all Gurkhas be offered equal right of residence was passed by 267 votes to 246. This was the only first-day motion defeat for a government since 1978. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, stated that \"this is an immense victory ... for the rights of Gurkhas who have been waiting so long for justice, a victory for Parliament, a victory for decency.\" He added that it was \"the kind of thing people want this country to do\".\n\nOn 21 May 2009 Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years service would be allowed to settle in the UK. Actress Joanna Lumley, daughter of Gurkha corps Maj. James Lumley who had highlighted the treatment of the Gurkhas and campaigned for their rights, commented, \"This is the welcome we have always longed to give\".\n\nA charity, The Gurkha Welfare Trust, provides aid to alleviate hardship and distress among Gurkha ex-servicemen.\n\nOn 9 June 2015, a celebration called the Gurkha 200, held at The Royal Hospital Chelsea and attended by members of the royal family, commemorated the bicentennial of the Gurkha Welfare Trust by paying tribute to Gurkha culture and military service.\n\nGurkha Square in Fleet, Hampshire, which contains the Fleet war memorial, is named after the Gurkhas.\n\nA 2008 UK High Court decision on a test case in London, \"R. (on the application of Limbu) v Secretary of State for the Home Department\" [2008] EWHC 2261 (Admin), acknowledged the \"debt of honour\" to Gurkhas discharged before 1997. The Home Secretary's policy allowing veterans to apply on a limited set of criteria (such as connection to the United Kingdom) was quashed as being unduly restrictive. The Court found that the Gurkhas had suffered a \"historic injustice\" and that the policy was irrational in failing to take into account factors such as length of service or particularly meritorious conduct.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The facility was partially destroyed in the Valley Fire in September 2015, and was temporarily closed; as of September 2017 it was announced the resort would reopen in early spring 2018.\n\nThe baths were commercially developed by settlers in the 1860s, when buildings were erected on the site. The region is prone to wildfires and, over the years, successive lodges have been rebuilt when they burned down. Harbin Hot Springs issued several postcards advertising the resort in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the property was run as a commune with the name Harbinger, \"centered around a man named Don Hamrick, a charismatic fellow who wore business suits and combined science with spiritualism in his lectures/sermons\". In 1969, Harbinger had about 120 people, but ultimately, the community did not thrive.\n\nAs of 2012, the clothing-optional retreat center was known as an outdoor spa with a New Age ambiance, where Watsu was developed.\n\nThe resort was evacuated because of the Valley Fire on September 12, 2015. By September 14, Harbin was almost completely destroyed by the fire with only the pool complex largely intact.\n\nRobert Hartley (AKA Ishvara) bought the land in 1972 to be a Gestalt center. Sold to the Heart Consciousness Church (HCC) in 1975, Harbin/HCC operates as an intentional community where approximately 150 residents live and operate the Retreat Center for outside visitors. Harbin/HCC maintains a more specifically religious organization, the New Age Church of Being, incorporated in 1996. Harbin is a center for the expression of New Age beliefs. Harbin's clothing-optional policy, its pools, and the natural beauty of the local landscape are part of Harbin's appeal to visitors, who must agree to membership, if only temporarily, for admission.\n\nHarbin has been a center for the development of new modes of healing and personal development, including Watsu (water shiatsu), a massage technique created by Harold Dull at Harbin in the early 1980s.

{"id": "15606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15606", "title": "Japanese language", "text": "Japanese language\n\nLittle is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial texts did not appear until the 8th century. During the Heian period (794–1185), Chinese had considerable influence on the vocabulary and phonology of Old Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (1185–1600) included changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, and the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th century–mid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of Japan's self-imposed isolation, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly. English loanwords, in particular, have become frequent, and Japanese words from English roots have proliferated.\n\nJapanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with simple phonotactics, a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and consonant length, and a lexically significant pitch-accent. Word order is normally subject–object–verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is topic–comment. Sentence-final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or make questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no articles. Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person. Japanese equivalents of adjectives are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.\n\nJapanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese, but it makes extensive use of Chinese characters, or , in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from Chinese. Along with \"kanji\", the Japanese writing system primarily uses two syllabic (or moraic) scripts, and . Latin script is used in a limited fashion, such as for imported acronyms, and the numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals alongside traditional Chinese numerals.\n\nA common ancestor of Japanese and Ryukyuan languages or dialects is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from either continental Asia or nearby Pacific islands sometime in the early- to mid-2nd century BC (the Yayoi period), replacing the languages of the original Jōmon inhabitants, including the ancestor of the modern Ainu language. Very little is known about the Japanese of this period. Because writing like the \"Kanji\" which later devolved into the writing systems \"Hiragana\" and \"Katakana\" had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period of Japanese must be based on the reconstructions of Old Japanese.\n\nOld Japanese is the oldest attested stage of the Japanese language. Through the spread of Buddhism, the Chinese writing system was imported to Japan. The earliest texts found in Japan are written in Classical Chinese, but they may have been meant to be read as Japanese by the kanbun method. Some of these Chinese texts show the influences of Japanese grammar, such as the word order (for example, placing the verb after the object). In these hybrid texts, Chinese characters are also occasionally used phonetically to represent Japanese particles. The earliest text, the \"Kojiki\", dates to the early 8th century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters. The end of Old Japanese coincides with the end of the Nara period in 794. Old Japanese uses the Man'yōgana system of writing, which uses \"kanji\" for their phonetic as well as semantic values. Based on the Man'yōgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct syllables. Texts written with Man'yōgana use two different \"kanji\" for each of the syllables now pronounced . (The \"Kojiki\" has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo and mo apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of syllables shrank to 67 in Early Middle Japanese, though some were added through Chinese influence.\n\nDue to these extra syllables, it has been hypothesized that Old Japanese's vowel system was larger than that of Modern Japanese – it perhaps contained up to eight vowels. According to Shinkichi Hashimoto, the extra syllables in Man'yōgana derive from differences between the vowels of the syllables in question. These differences would indicate that Old Japanese had an eight-vowel system, in contrast to the five vowels of later Japanese. The vowel system would have to have shrunk some time between these texts and the invention of the \"kana\" (\"hiragana\" and \"katakana\") in the early 9th century. According to this view, the eight-vowel system of ancient Japanese would resemble that of the Uralic and Altaic language families. However, it is not fully certain that the alternation between syllables necessarily reflects a difference in the vowels rather than the consonants – at the moment, the only undisputed fact is that they are different syllables. A newer reconstruction of ancient Japanese shows strikingly similarities with Southeast-Asian languages, especially with Austronesian languages.\n\nOld Japanese does not have , but rather (preserved in modern \"fu\", ), which has been reconstructed to an earlier *. Man'yōgana also has a symbol for , which merges with before the end of the period.\n\nSeveral fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language – the genitive particle \"tsu\" (superseded by modern \"no\") is preserved in words such as \"matsuge\" (\"eyelash\", lit. \"hair of the eye\"); modern \"mieru\" (\"to be visible\") and \"kikoeru\" (\"to be audible\") retain what may have been a mediopassive suffix -\"yu(ru)\" (\"kikoyu\" → \"kikoyuru\" (the attributive form, which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period) > \"kikoeru\" (as all shimo-nidan verbs in modern Japanese did)); and the genitive particle \"ga\" remains in intentionally archaic speech.\n\nEarly Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the Heian period, from 794 to 1185. Early Middle Japanese sees a significant amount of Chinese influence on the language's phonology – length distinctions become phonemic for both consonants and vowels, and series of both labialised (e.g. \"kwa\") and palatalised (\"kya\") consonants are added. Intervocalic merges with by the 11th century.\nThe end of Early Middle Japanese sees the beginning of a shift where the attributive form (Japanese \"rentaikei\") slowly replaces the uninflected form (\"shūshikei\") for those verb classes where the two were distinct.\n\nLate Middle Japanese covers the years from 1185 to 1600, and is normally divided into two sections, roughly equivalent to the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, respectively. The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non-native sources, in this case the Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries; and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms (for instance, the \"Arte da Lingoa de Iapam\"). Among other sound changes, the sequence merges to , in contrast with ; is reintroduced from Chinese; and merges with . Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear – the continuative ending -\"te\" begins to reduce onto the verb (e.g. \"yonde\" for earlier \"yomite\"), the -k- in the final syllable of adjectives drops out (\"shiroi\" for earlier \"shiroki\"); and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form (e.g. \"hayaku\" > \"hayau\" > \"hayɔɔ\", where modern Japanese just has \"hayaku\", though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting \"o-hayō gozaimasu\" \"good morning\"; this ending is also seen in \"o-medetō\" \"congratulations\", from \"medetaku\").\n\nLate Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages – now-common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include \"pan\" (\"bread\") and \"tabako\" (\"tobacco\", now \"cigarette\"), both from Portuguese.\n\nEarly Modern Japanese, not to be confused with Modern Japanese, was the dialect used after the Meiji Restoration. Because the two languages are extremely similar, Early Modern Japanese is commonly referred to as Modern Japanese. Early Modern Japanese gradually evolved into Modern Japanese during the 19th century. Only after 1945, shortly after World War II, did Modern Japanese become the standard language, seeing use in most official communications. In this time period the Japanese in addition to their use of Katakana and Hiragana they also used traditional Chinese characters called \"Han\" which later developed in \"Kanji\" which is a form of writing used to express ideas in the Japanese and Chinese languages.\n\nModern Japanese is considered to begin with the Edo period, which lasted between 1603 and 1868. Since Old Japanese, the de facto standard Japanese had been the Kansai dialect, especially that of Kyoto. However, during the Edo period, Edo (now Tokyo) developed into the largest city in Japan, and the Edo-area dialect became standard Japanese. Since the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly. The period since 1945 has seen a large number of words borrowed from other languagessuch as German, Portuguese and English. Many English loan words especially relate to technologyfor example, \"pasokon\" (short for \"personal computer\"), \"intānetto\" (\"internet\"), and \"kamera\" (\"camera\"). Due to the large quantity of English loanwords, modern Japanese has developed a distinction between and , and and , with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords.\n\nAlthough Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has been spoken outside. Before and during World War II, through Japanese annexation of Taiwan and Korea, as well as partial occupation of China, the Philippines, and various Pacific islands, locals in those countries learned Japanese as the language of the empire. As a result, many elderly people in these countries can still speak Japanese.\n\nJapanese emigrant communities (the largest of which are to be found in Brazil, with 1.4 million to 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants, according to Brazilian IBGE data, more than the 1.2 million of the United States) sometimes employ Japanese as their primary language. Approximately 12% of Hawaii residents speak Japanese, with an estimated 12.6% of the population of Japanese ancestry in 2008. Japanese emigrants can also be found in Peru, Argentina, Australia (especially in the eastern states), Canada (especially in Vancouver where 1.4% of the population has Japanese ancestry), the United States (notably Hawaii, where 16.7% of the population has Japanese ancestry, and California), and the Philippines (particularly in Davao and Laguna).\n\nJapanese has no official status, but is the \"de facto\" national language of Japan. There is a form of the language considered standard: , meaning \"standard Japanese\", or , \"common language\". The meanings of the two terms are almost the same. \"Hyōjungo\" or \"kyōtsūgo\" is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect. This normative language was born after the from the language spoken in the higher-class areas of Tokyo (see Yamanote). \"Hyōjungo\" is taught in schools and used on television and even in official communications. It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.\n\nFormerly, standard was different from . The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. \"Bungo\" was the main method of writing Japanese until about 1900; since then \"kōgo\" gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the 1940s. \"Bungo\" still has some relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in \"bungo\", although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). \"Kōgo\" is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today, although \"bungo\" grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect.\n\nDozens of dialects are spoken in Japan. The profusion is due to many factors, including the length of time the Japanese Archipelago has been inhabited, its mountainous island terrain, and Japan's long history of both external and internal isolation. Dialects typically differ in terms of pitch accent, inflectional morphology, vocabulary, and particle usage. Some even differ in vowel and consonant inventories, although this is uncommon.\n\nThe main distinction in Japanese accents is between and . Within each type are several subdivisions. Kyoto-Osaka-type dialects are in the central region, roughly formed by Kansai, Shikoku, and western Hokuriku regions.\n\nDialects from peripheral regions, such as Tōhoku or Kagoshima, may be unintelligible to speakers from the other parts of the country. There are some language islands in mountain villages or isolated islands such as Hachijō-jima island whose dialects are descended from the Eastern dialect of Old Japanese. Dialects of the Kansai region are spoken or known by many Japanese, and Osaka dialect in particular is associated with comedy (see Kansai dialect). Dialects of Tōhoku and North Kantō are associated with typical farmers.\n\nThe Ryūkyūan languages, spoken in Okinawa and the Amami Islands (politically part of Kagoshima), are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the Japonic family; not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers, but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ryūkyūan languages. However, in contrast to linguists, many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ryūkyūan languages as dialects of Japanese. The imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time. Most likely being the spoken form of Classical Japanese language, a writing style that was prevalent during the Heian period, but began decline during the late Meiji period.\n\nModern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide (including the Ryūkyū islands) due to education, mass media, and an increase of mobility within Japan, as well as economic integration.\n\nJapanese is a member of the Japonic languages family, which also includes the languages spoken throughout the Ryūkyū Islands. As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language, Japanese is often called a language isolate.\n\nAccording to Martine Irma Robbeets, Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world. Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late 19th century, attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as Ainu, Korean, Chinese, Tibeto-Burman, Ural-Altaic, Altaic, Uralic, Mon–Khmer, Malayo-Polynesian and Ryukyuan. At the fringe, some linguists have suggested a link to Indo-European languages, including Greek, and to Lepcha. As it stands, only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support, though linguist Kurakichi Shiratori maintained that Japanese was a language isolate.\n\nSimilarities between Korean and Japanese were noted by Arai Hakuseki in 1717, and the idea that the two might be related was first proposed in 1781 by Japanese scholar Teikan Fujii. The idea received little attention until William George Aston proposed it again in 1879. Japanese scholar Shōsaburō Kanazawa took it up in 1910, as did Shinpei Ogura in 1934. Shirō Hattori was nearly alone when he criticised these theories in 1959. Samuel Martin furthered the idea in 1966 with his \"Lexical evidence relating Korean to Japanese\", as did John Whitman with his dissertation on the subject in 1985. Despite this, definitive proof of the relation has yet to be provided. Historical linguists studying Japanese and Korean tend to accept the genealogical relation, while general linguists and historical linguists in Japan and Korea have remained skeptical.\n\nAlexander Vovin suggests that, while typologically modern Korean and Japanese share similarities that sometimes allow word-to-word translations, studies of the pre-modern languages show greater differences. According to Vovin, this suggests linguistic convergence rather than divergence, which he believes is amongst the evidence of the languages not having a genealogical connection.\n\nThe largely discredited Altaic family, which would include languages from far eastern Europe to northeastern Asia, has had its supporters and detractors over its history. The most controversial aspect of the hypothesis is the proposed inclusion of Korean and Japanese, which even some proponents of Altaic have rejected. Philipp Franz von Siebold suggested the connection in 1832, but the inclusion first attracted significant attention in the early 1970s. Roy Andrew Miller published \"Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages\", and dedicated much of his later career to the subject. Sergei Starostin published a 1991 monograph which was another significant stepping stone in Japanese—Altaic research. A team of scholars made a database of Altaic etymologies available over the internet, from which the three-volume \"Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages\" was published in 2003. Scholars such as Yevgeny Polivanov and Yoshizo Itabashi, on the other hand, have proposed a hybrid origin of Japanese, in which Austronesian and Altaic elements became mixed.\n\nSkepticism over the Japanese relation to Altaic is widespread among Altaic's proponents, in part because of a large number of unsuccessful attempts to establish genealogical relationships with Japanese and other languages. Opinions are polarized, with many strongly convinced of the Altaic relation, and others strongly convinced of the lack of one. While some sources are undecided, often strong proponents of either view will not even acknowledge the claims of the other side.\n\nJapanese shows in its proto-form strong similarities to Southeast Asian languages. A 2015 analysis using the Automated Similarity Judgment Program resulted in the Japonic languages being grouped with the Ainu and then with the Austroasiatic languages.\n\nAll Japanese vowels are pure—that is, there are no diphthongs, only monophthongs. The only unusual vowel is the high back vowel , which may be compressed rather than rounded and fronted. Japanese has five vowels, and vowel length is phonemic, with each having both a short and a long version. Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel (a macron) in rōmaji, a repeated vowel character in hiragana, or a chōonpu succeeding the vowel in katakana.\n\nSome Japanese consonants have several allophones, which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds. However, some of these allophones have since become phonemic. For example, in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the 20th century, the phonemic sequence was palatalized and realized phonetically as , approximately \"chi\" ; however, now and are distinct, as evidenced by words like \"tī\" \"Western style tea\" and \"chii\" \"social status\".\n\nThe \"r\" of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an apical central tap and a lateral approximant. The \"g\" is also notable; unless it starts a sentence, it may be pronounced , in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects.\n\nThe syllabic structure and the phonotactics are very simple: the only consonant clusters allowed within a syllable consist of one of a subset of the consonants plus . This type of cluster only occurs in onsets. However, consonant clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are a nasal followed by a homorganic consonant. Consonant length (gemination) is also phonemic.\n\nThe phonology of Japanese also includes a pitch accent system, which is a system that helps differentiate words with identical Hiragana spelling or words in different Japanese dialects. An example of words with identical Hiragana would be the words (\"chopsticks\") and (\"bridge\"), both spelled (はし, \"hashi\") in Hiragana. The stresses differentiate the words.\n\nJapanese word order is classified as subject–object–verb. Unlike many Indo-European languages, the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence (possibly followed by sentence-end particles). This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with particles that identify their grammatical functions.\n\nThe basic sentence structure is topic–comment. For example, \"Kochira wa Tanaka-san desu\" (). \"kochira\" (\"this\") is the topic of the sentence, indicated by the particle \" wa\". The verb \"de aru\" (\"desu\" is a contraction of its polite form \"de arimasu\") is a copula, commonly translated as \"to be\" or \"it is\" (though there are other verbs that can be translated as \"to be\"), though technically it holds no meaning and is used to give a sentence 'politeness'. As a phrase, \"Tanaka-san desu\" is the comment. This sentence literally translates to \"As for this person, (it) is Mr./Ms. Tanaka.\" Thus Japanese, like many other Asian languages, is often called a topic-prominent language, which means it has a strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject, and that the two do not always coincide. The sentence \"Zō wa hana ga nagai \" () literally means, \"As for elephant(s), (the) nose(s) (is/are) long\". The topic is \"zō\" \"elephant\", and the subject is \"hana\" \"nose\".\n\nIn Japanese, the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated if it is obvious from context. As a result of this grammatical permissiveness, there is a tendency to gravitate towards brevity; Japanese speakers tend to omit pronouns on the theory they are inferred from the previous sentence, and are therefore understood. In the context of the above example, \"hana-ga nagai\" would mean \"[their] noses are long,\" while \"nagai\" by itself would mean \"[they] are long.\" A single verb can be a complete sentence: \"Yatta!\" () \"[I / we / they / etc] did [it]!\". In addition, since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence (below), a single adjective can be a complete sentence: \"Urayamashii!\" () \"[I'm] jealous [of it]!\".\n\nWhile the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns, these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo-European languages, and function differently. In some cases Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action: \"down\" to indicate the out-group gives a benefit to the in-group; and \"up\" to indicate the in-group gives a benefit to the out-group. Here, the in-group includes the speaker and the out-group does not, and their boundary depends on context. For example, \"oshiete moratta\" () (literally, \"explained\" with a benefit from the out-group to the in-group) means \"[he/she/they] explained [it] to [me/us]\". Similarly, \"oshiete ageta\" () (literally, \"explained\" with a benefit from the in-group to the out-group) means \"[I/we] explained [it] to [him/her/them]\". Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo-European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action.\n\nJapanese \"pronouns\" also function differently from most modern Indo-European pronouns (and more like nouns) in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may. For instance, one does not say in English:\nBut one \"can\" grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese:\n\nThis is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns, such as \"kimi\" \"you\" ( \"lord\"), \"anata\" \"you\" ( \"that side, yonder\"), and \"boku\" \"I\" ( \"servant\"). This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese \"pronouns\" as pronouns, but rather as referential nouns, much like Spanish \"usted\" (contracted from \"vuestra merced\", \"your [(flattering majestic) plural] grace\") or Portuguese \"o senhor\". Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom.\n\nThe choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken: men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as \"watashi\" ( \"private\") or \"watakushi\" (also ), while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word \"ore\" ( \"oneself\", \"myself\") or \"boku\". Similarly, different words such as \"anata\", \"kimi\", and \"omae\" (, more formally \"the one before me\") may be used to refer to a listener depending on the listener's relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener. When used in different social relationships, the same word may have positive (intimate or respectful) or negative (distant or disrespectful) connotations.\n\nJapanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English. For example, when speaking to one's teacher, it is appropriate to use \"sensei\" (, teacher), but inappropriate to use \"anata\". This is because \"anata\" is used to refer to people of equal or lower status, and one's teacher has higher status.\n\nJapanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun \"hon\" () may refer to a single book or several books; \"hito\" () can mean \"person\" or \"people\", and \"ki\" () can be \"tree\" or \"trees\". Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a counter word) or (rarely) by adding a suffix, or sometimes by duplication (e.g. , \"hitobito\", usually written with an iteration mark as ). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus \"Tanaka-san\" usually means \"Mr./Ms. Tanaka\". Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as \"-tachi\", but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase \"and company\". A group described as \"Tanaka-san-tachi\" may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as \"hitobito\" \"people\" and \"wareware\" \"we/us\", while the word \"tomodachi\" \"friend\" is considered singular, although plural in form.\n\nVerbs are conjugated to show tenses, of which there are two: past and present (or non-past) which is used for the present and the future. For verbs that represent an ongoing process, the \"-te iru\" form indicates a continuous (or progressive) aspect, similar to the suffix \"ing\" in English. For others that represent a change of state, the \"-te iru\" form indicates a perfect aspect. For example, \"kite iru\" means \"He has come (and is still here)\", but \"tabete iru\" means \"He is eating\".\n\nQuestions (both with an interrogative pronoun and yes/no questions) have the same structure as affirmative sentences, but with intonation rising at the end. In the formal register, the question particle \"-ka\" is added. For example, \"ii desu\" () \"It is OK\" becomes \"ii desu-ka\" () \"Is it OK?\". In a more informal tone sometimes the particle \"-no\" () is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: \"Dōshite konai-no?\" \"Why aren't (you) coming?\". Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer's attention: \"Kore wa?\" \"(What about) this?\"; \"O-namae wa?\" () \"(What's your) name?\".\n\nNegatives are formed by inflecting the verb. For example, \"Pan o taberu\" () \"I will eat bread\" or \"I eat bread\" becomes \"Pan o tabenai\" () \"I will not eat bread\" or \"I do not eat bread\". Plain negative forms are actually \"i\"-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. \"Pan o tabenakatta\" () \"I did not eat bread\".\n\nThe so-called \"-te\" verb form is used for a variety of purposes: either progressive or perfect aspect (see above); combining verbs in a temporal sequence (\"Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru\" \"I'll eat breakfast and leave at once\"), simple commands, conditional statements and permissions (\"Dekakete-mo ii?\" \"May I go out?\"), etc.\n\nThe word \"da\" (plain), \"desu\" (polite) is the copula verb. It corresponds approximately to the English \"be\", but often takes on other roles, including a marker for tense, when the verb is conjugated into its past form \"datta\" (plain), \"deshita\" (polite). This comes into use because only \"i\"-adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese. Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence (\"there is\") or, in some contexts, property: \"aru\" (negative \"nai\") and \"iru\" (negative \"inai\"), for inanimate and animate things, respectively. For example, \"Neko ga iru\" \"There's a cat\", \"Ii kangae-ga nai\" \"[I] haven't got a good idea\".\n\nThe verb \"to do\" (\"suru\", polite form \"shimasu\") is often used to make verbs from nouns (\"ryōri suru\" \"to cook\", \"benkyō suru\" \"to study\", etc.) and has been productive in creating modern slang words. Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. \"tobidasu\" \"to fly out, to flee,\" from \"tobu\" \"to fly, to jump\" + \"dasu\" \"to put out, to emit\").\n\nThere are three types of adjectives (see Japanese adjectives):\n\nBoth \"keiyōshi\" and \"keiyōdōshi\" may predicate sentences. For example,\nBoth inflect, though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs.\nThe \"rentaishi\" in Modern Japanese are few in number, and unlike the other words, are limited to directly modifying nouns. They never predicate sentences. Examples include \"ookina\" \"big\", \"kono\" \"this\", \"iwayuru\" \"so-called\" and \"taishita\" \"amazing\".\n\nBoth \"keiyōdōshi\" and \"keiyōshi\" form adverbs, by following with \"ni\" in the case of \"keiyōdōshi\":\nand by changing \"i\" to \"ku\" in the case of \"keiyōshi\":\n\nThe grammatical function of nouns is indicated by postpositions, also called particles. These include for example:\nIt is also used for the lative case, indicating a motion to a location.\n\nNote: The subtle difference between wa and ga in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such, because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there. While \"wa\" indicates the topic, which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon, it carries the implication that the subject indicated by \"wa\" is not unique, or may be part of a larger group.\nAbsence of \"wa\" often means the subject is the focus of the sentence.\n\nJapanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality. This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society.\n\nThe Japanese language can express differing levels in social status. The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job, age, experience, or even psychological state (e.g., a person asking a favour tends to do so politely). The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech, whereas the other person might use a plainer form. Strangers will also speak to each other politely. Japanese children rarely use polite speech until they are teens, at which point they are expected to begin speaking in a more adult manner. \"See uchi-soto\".\n\nWhereas \"teineigo\" () (polite language) is commonly an inflectional system, \"sonkeigo\" () (respectful language) and \"kenjōgo\" () (humble language) often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs: \"iku\" \"go\" becomes \"ikimasu\" in polite form, but is replaced by \"irassharu\" in honorific speech and \"ukagau\" or \"mairu\" in humble speech.\n\nThe difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group. For example, the \"-san\" suffix (\"Mr\" \"Mrs.\" or \"Miss\") is an example of honorific language. It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one's company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's in-group. When speaking directly to one's superior in one's company or when speaking with other employees within one's company about a superior, a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in-group superior and their speech and actions. When speaking to a person from another company (i.e., a member of an out-group), however, a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their own in-group superiors. In short, the register used in Japanese to refer to the person, speech, or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship (either in-group or out-group) between the speaker and listener, as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker, listener, and third-person referents.\n\nMost nouns in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of \"o-\" or \"go-\" as a prefix. \"o-\" is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas \"go-\" is affixed to words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as \"gohan\" 'cooked rice; meal.' Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item's owner or to the object itself. For example, the word \"tomodachi\" 'friend,' would become \"o-tomodachi\" when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children's friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to \"mizu\" 'water' as \"o-mizu\" in order to show politeness.\n\nMost Japanese people employ politeness to indicate a lack of familiarity. That is, they use polite forms for new acquaintances, but if a relationship becomes more intimate, they no longer use them. This occurs regardless of age, social class, or gender.\n\nThere are three main sources of words in the Japanese language, the \"yamato kotoba\" (大和言葉) or \"wago\" (和語), \"kango\" (漢語), and \"gairaigo\" (外来語).\n\nThe original language of Japan, or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation, was the so-called \"yamato kotoba\" ( or infrequently , i.e. \"Yamato words\"), which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as \"wago\" ( or rarely , i.e. the \"Wa language\"). In addition to words from this original language, present-day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from Chinese or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns. These words, known as \"kango\" (), entered the language from the 5th century onwards via contact with Chinese culture. According to the \"Shinsen Kokugo Jiten\" (新選国語辞典) Japanese dictionary, \"kango\" comprise 49.1% of the total vocabulary, \"wago\" make up 33.8%, other foreign words or \"gairaigo\" () account for 8.8%, and the remaining 8.3% constitute hybridized words or \"konshugo\" () that draw elements from more than one language.\n\nThere are also a great number of words of mimetic origin in Japanese, with Japanese having a rich collection of sound symbolism, both onomatopoeia for physical sounds, and more abstract words. A small number of words have come into Japanese from the Ainu language. \"Tonakai\" (reindeer), \"rakko\" (sea otter) and \"shishamo\" (smelt, a type of fish) are well-known examples of words of Ainu origin.\n\nWords of different origins occupy different registers in Japanese. Like Latin-derived words in English, \"kango\" words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words. Indeed, it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin/French roots typically corresponds to a Sino-Japanese word in Japanese, whereas a simpler Anglo-Saxon word would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent.\n\nIncorporating vocabulary from European languages, \"gairaigo\", began with borrowings from Portuguese in the 16th century, followed by words from Dutch during Japan's long isolation of the Edo period. With the Meiji Restoration and the reopening of Japan in the 19th century, borrowing occurred from German, French, and English. Today most borrowings are from English.\n\nIn the Meiji era, the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts; these are known as wasei kango (Japanese-made Chinese words). Many of these were then imported into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, \"seiji\" 政治 (\"politics\"), and \"kagaku\" 化学 (\"chemistry\") are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese, and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages. As a result, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way a large number of Greek- and Latin-derived words – both inherited or borrowed into European languages, or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots – are shared among modern European languages – see classical compound.\n\nIn the past few decades, \"wasei-eigo\" (\"made-in-Japan English\") has become a prominent phenomenon. Words such as \"wanpatān\" (< \"one\" + \"pattern\", \"to be in a rut\", \"to have a one-track mind\") and \"sukinshippu\" (< \"skin\" + \"-ship\", \"physical contact\"), although coined by compounding English roots, are nonsensical in most non-Japanese contexts; exceptions exist in nearby languages such as Korean however, which often use words such as \"skinship\" and \"rimokon\" (remote control) in the same way as in Japanese.\n\nThe popularity of many Japanese cultural exports has made some native Japanese words familiar in English, including \"futon, haiku, judo, kamikaze, karaoke, karate, ninja, origami, rickshaw\" (from \"jinrikisha\"), \"samurai, sayonara, Sudoku, sumo, sushi, tsunami, tycoon\". See list of English words of Japanese origin for more.\n\nLiteracy was introduced to Japan in the form of the Chinese writing system, by way of Baekje before the 5th century. Using this language, the Japanese king Bu presented a petition to Emperor Shun of Liu Song in AD 478. After the ruin of Baekje, Japan invited scholars from China to learn more of the Chinese writing system. Japanese emperors gave an official rank to Chinese scholars (続守言/薩弘格/ 袁晋卿) and spread the use of Chinese characters from the 7th century to the 8th century.\n\nAt first, the Japanese wrote in Classical Chinese, with Japanese names represented by characters used for their meanings and not their sounds. Later, during the 7th century AD, the Chinese-sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose, but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound. This is when the history of Japanese as a written language begins in its own right. By this time, the Japanese language was already very distinct from the Ryukyuan languages.\n\nAn example of this mixed style is the Kojiki, which was written in AD 712. They then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as \"man'yōgana\", a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech syllable by syllable.\n\nOver time, a writing system evolved. Chinese characters (kanji) were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese, or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings. Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements, were simplified, and eventually became two syllabic scripts: hiragana and katakana which were developed based on Manyogana from Baekje. However this hypothesis \"Manyogana from Baekje\" is denied by other scholars.\n\nHiragana and Katakana were first simplified from Kanji, and Hiragana, emerging somewhere around the 9th century, was mainly used by women. Hiragana was seen as an informal language, whereas Katakana and Kanji were considered more formal and was typically used by men and in official settings. However, because of hiragana's easy of use, more and more people began using it. Eventually, by the 10th century, hiragana was used by everyone.\n\nModern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: kanji, characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese loanwords into Japanese and a number of native Japanese morphemes; and two syllabaries: hiragana and katakana. The Latin script (or romaji in Japanese) is used to a certain extent, such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non-Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word (such as \"ramen\" at a restaurant). Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji when used in counting, but kanji numerals are still used in compounds, such as \"tōitsu\" (\"unification\").\n\nHistorically, attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid-19th century, but did not become a matter of government intervention until after Japan's defeat in the Second World War. During the period of post-war occupation (and influenced by the views of some U.S. officials), various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of rōmaji were considered. The \"jōyō kanji\" (\"common use kanji\", originally called \"tōyō kanji\" [kanji for general use]) scheme arose as a compromise solution.\n\nJapanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school. A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the list of \"kyōiku kanji\" (\"education kanji\", a subset of \"jōyō kanji\"), specifies the 1,006 simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade. Children continue to study another 1,130 characters in junior high school, covering in total 2,136 \"jōyō kanji\". The official list of \"jōyō kanji\" was revised several times, but the total number of officially sanctioned characters remained largely unchanged.\n\nAs for kanji for personal names, the circumstances are somewhat complicated. \"Jōyō kanji\" and \"jinmeiyō kanji\" (an appendix of additional characters for names) are approved for registering personal names. Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration. However, as with the list of \"jōyō kanji\", criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use. Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful, the list of \"jinmeiyō kanji\" was substantially extended from 92 in 1951 (the year it was first decreed) to 983 in 2004. Furthermore, families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms.\n\n\"Hiragana\" are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs (and adjectives) in Japanese are conjugated, kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing its meaning. For this reason, hiragana are suffixed to the ends of kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations. Hiragana used in this way are called okurigana. Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called furigana above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading. This is done to facilitate learning, as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure (or sometimes invented) readings.\n\n\"Katakana\", like hiragana, are a syllabary; katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, \"Australia\" has been adapted as \"Ōsutoraria\" (), and \"supermarket\" has been adapted and shortened into \"sūpā\" ().\n\nMany major universities throughout the world provide Japanese language courses, and a number of secondary and even primary schools worldwide offer courses in the language. This is much changed from before World War II; in 1940, only 65 Americans not of Japanese descent were able to read, write and understand the language.\n\nInternational interest in the Japanese language dates from the 19th century but has become more prevalent following Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s and the global popularity of Japanese popular culture (such as anime and video games) since the 1990s. Close to 4 million people studied the language worldwide in 2012: more than 1 million Chinese, 872,000 Indonesian, and 840,000 South Koreans studied Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions. In the three years from 2009 to 2012 the number of students studying Japanese in China increased by 26.5 percent/three years, and by 21.8 percent in Indonesia, but dropped 12.8 percent in South Korea.\n\nIn Japan, more than 90,000 foreign students studied at Japanese universities and Japanese language schools, including 77,000 Chinese and 15,000 South Koreans in 2003. In addition, local governments and some NPO groups provide free Japanese language classes for foreign residents, including Japanese Brazilians and foreigners married to Japanese nationals. In the United Kingdom, study of the Japanese language is supported by the British Association for Japanese Studies. In Ireland, Japanese is offered as a language in the Leaving Certificate in some schools.\n\nThe Japanese government provides standardized tests to measure spoken and written comprehension of Japanese for second language learners; the most prominent is the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), which features five levels of exams (changed from four levels in 2010), ranging from elementary (N5) to advanced (N1). The JLPT is offered twice a year. The Japanese External Trade Organization JETRO organizes the \"Business Japanese Proficiency Test\" which tests the learner's ability to understand Japanese in a business setting. The Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation, which took over the BJT from JETRO in 2009, announced in August 2010 that the test would be discontinued in 2011 due to financial pressures on the Foundation. However, it has since issued a statement to the effect that the test will continue to be available as a result of support from the Japanese government.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2618713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2618713", "title": "LGBT History Month", "text": "LGBT History Month\n\nLGBT History Month is a month-long annual observance of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender history, and the history of the gay rights and related civil rights movements. LGBT History Month provides role models, builds community, and represents a civil rights statement about the contributions of the LGBT community. Currently, LGBT History Month is a month-long celebration that is specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United States and Canada, it is celebrated in October to coincide with National Coming Out Day on October 11. In the United Kingdom, it is observed during February, to coincide with a major celebration of the 2003 abolition of Section 28. In Berlin, It is known as Queer History Month. Other LGBT-progressive countries, however, celebrate LGBT History with much shorter events.\n\nLGBT History Month originated in the United States, and was first celebrated in 1994. It was founded by Missouri high-school history teacher Rodney Wilson. Wilson originated the idea, served as founder on the first coordinating committee, and chose October as the month of celebration. Among early supporters and members of the first coordinating committee were Kevin Jennings of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN); Kevin Boyer of the Gerber/Hart Gay and Lesbian Library and Archives in Chicago; Paul Varnell, writer for the Windy City Times; Torey Wilson, Chicago area teacher; Johnda Boyce, women's studies major at Columbus State University and Jessea Greenman of UC-Berkeley. Many gay and lesbian organizations supported the concept early on as did Governors William Weld of Massachusetts and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, Mayors such as Thomas Menino of Boston and Wellington Webb of Denver, who recognized the inaugural month with official proclamations. In 1995, the National Education Association indicated support of LGBT History Month as well as other history months by resolution at its General Assembly.\n\nOctober was chosen by Wilson as the month for the celebration because National Coming Out Day already was established as a widely known event, on October 11, the date of the Second March of Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights., In 1987, October also commemorated the first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights by LGBT people in 1979. LGBT History Month is intended to encourage honesty and openness about being LGBT.\n\nWhile it was first known as Lesbian and Gay History Month, the coordinating committee soon added \"bisexual\" to the title. It has subsequently become known as LGBT History Month. The event has received criticism from conservative groups, such as the Concerned Women for America and others who believe it to be a form of \"indoctrination.\"\n\nOn June 2, 2000, President Bill Clinton declared June \"Gay & Lesbian Pride Month\". President Barack Obama declared June Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month on June 1, 2009.\n\nEquality Forum, a national and international LGBT civil rights organization with an educational focus, undertook responsibility for LGBT Month in 2006. Each day in October, an Icon is featured with a video, biography, bibliography, downloadable images and other educational resources at www.lgbthistorymonth.com.\nIn 2011, Equality Forum introduced an internal search engine for all Icons from inception in 2006 to present. By clicking on \"Icon Search\" and choosing one of hundreds of categories such as African-American, athlete, California, Germany, HIV/AIDS, Military, Religion, Transgender, Youth; visitors to the site will be provided with links to all Icons in that category.\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, two American school districts celebrated LGBT History Month. The Broward County school district in Florida signed a resolution in September in support of LGBT Americans, and later that year the Los Angeles school district, America's second-largest, also signed on.\n\nLGBT History Month was initiated in the UK by Sue Sanders and Paul Patrick as a Schools OUT UK project, which first took place in February 2005. The Month is an annual event in the United Kingdom taking place every February to coincide with a slower month in the schools calendar.\n\nThe event came in the wake of the abolition of Section 28 in 2003, the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 as well as the government's proposals to bring in a single equality act and a public duty, although this, in fact, did not come to fruition until 2010.\n\nThe Month is intended as a means to raise awareness of, and combat prejudice against the LGBT community while celebrating its achievement and diversity and making it more visible.\n\nThe first celebration in 2005 saw the organisation of over 150 events around the UK. The second logo for the organisation behind the month was designed by LGBT typographer Tony Malone in 2006, and was reworked by him in 2007 when it then became the corporate logo for the national committee.\n\nFrom that point in time, each yearly iteration of the Month started to receive its own mark designed by students of the University of the Arts and later by design students at the University of Bedfordshire.\n\nThe initiative received government backing from the deputy DfES and Equalities Minister Jacqui Smith, although some sections of the press argued against its political correctness, and pointed out that the sexuality of some historical figures is more a matter of speculation than fact. Supporters of the event countered that it is important to challenge heterosexist attitudes in society.\n\nThe DfES promised funding for LGBT History Month for the first two years to help get the event off the ground. It is now very well established and has garnered support from other sources. Long standing sponsors include the Metropolitan Police Service, the Metropolitan Police Authority, Amnesty International and the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nThe early patrons of the Month included Cyril Nri, Ian McKellen, Angela Eagle, Gareth Thomas and Labi Siffre.\n\nEach year, a \"launch event\" takes place in November, for the following Month. Those events took place in the following locations:\n\nThrough the years many speakers have spoken at the events. These include Ian McKellen, Stella Duffy, Allan Horsfall, Linda Bellos, Baroness Scotland and Barbara Follett, Michael Cashman, Stuart Milk, Phyl gyimah opuku and Rikki Beadle Blair among others.\n\nOn March 5, 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown hosted a reception at Downing Street to mark the Month.\n\nIn 2015 saw the first edition of \"OUTing The Past\", a festival of LGBT History spearheaded by Dr Jeff Evans. The festival started in three venues in Manchester: the LGBT Foundation, The Central Library and the Peoples History Museum. Comprising several presentations of diverse history presented by a mixture of academics, LGBT enthusiasts and activists. Sitting alongside the popular presentations was an academic conference with the inaugural Alan Horsfall Lecture given by Professor Charles Upchurch of Florida University. This is now a yearly event funded by the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. There were 3 theatrical performances across the weekend exploring the true story ‘A Very Victorian Scandal’ about the fate of men who attended a drag ball in 1880 in Hulme.\n\nThe following year the festival expanded to six hubs around England and the conference had its own slot. The Alan Horsfall lecture was given by Professor Susan Stryker of the University of Arizona in 2016.\n\nIn 2017 there were 18 venues round the country and by now over a hundred presentations on LGBT history had been given. The Alan Horsfall lecture was given by Diana Souhami.\n\nIn 2018 there were 11 venues which included Wales and Northern Ireland. The lecture was given by Tom Robinson.\n\n2019 will have 18 venues and will go international as it will include events in The Republic of Ireland Sweden, Norway and New York. The lecture will be given by Dr Jeffrey Weeks in Belfast.\n\nFrom 2016, Schools OUT UK has partnered with a several contract publishers to produce magazines as an Official Guide to LGBT History Month, putting 35,000 copies of their publication into every secondary school in the UK, plus community spaces, charities and businesses. The magazine had introductions from the leaders of all the main political parties and the Mayor of London. The magazine's Diversity Dashboard runs job adverts and events listings from LGBT-friendly employers and the community.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, LGBT History Month was celebrated in Scotland as an LGBT community event, receiving support from LGBT community history projects such as Our Story Scotland and Remember When.\n\nFor 2007 and 2008, the Scottish Government provided funding for a post at LGBT Youth Scotland to bring LGBT History Month into the wider community, including schools and youth groups.\n\nIn Berlin, it is known as Queer History Month instead of LGBT History Month. Every year it takes place in June. It is to educate and help people deal with sexual, sexual diversity, and anti- discrimination in small projects.\n\nDuring Queer History Month (QHM), people are able to find detailed lessons on queer history suitable for both school and non-school education. Also educational institutions provide education to schools and youth institutions directly.\n\nIn Greenland, LGBT history is celebrated with a Pride Parade instead of a month-long celebration. It started in 2010 when 19-year-old Nuka Bisgard and her friend Lu Berthelse, 24, another woman, teamed up with other Greenlanders to create a pride celebration. This was made to help Greenland's visible and invisible gay community feel more inclusive and united. On May 15, 2010, their hard work paid off when Pride drew over a thousand participants. Gay Pride has successfully been repeated since 2010.\n\nIn Brazil, LGBT history is celebrated during the São Paulo Gay Pride. Its events have been organized by the APOGLBT – Associacao da Parada do Orgulho de Gays, Lesbicas, Bissexuais e Travestis e Transexuais (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transvestite Pride Parade Association) since its foundation in 1999. Each year, the events are held in either May or June.\n\nA non-profit organization, the APOGLBT's mission is to fight for a more just and inclusive society, which recognizes equal rights for all. The association has served to promote citizenship and self-esteem of LGBT by conducting and encouraging activities of all kinds. The almost 22 years of success reflect the seriousness of the organization with its principles and goals.\n\nIn Sydney, Australia, in the middle of their summer, Mardi Gras has become a highly anticipated LGBT annual event. It is called the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. There is the parade in the Western World, the Bondi Beach Drag Races, a harbour party, a film festival, a Fair Day, and a series of academic and cultural discussions.\n\nMardi Gras was Sydney's contribution to the international gay solidarity celebrations, an event that had grown up as a result of the Stonewall riots in New York. Mardi Gras was one of a series of events by the Gay Solidarity Group to promote the forthcoming National Homosexual Conference, and offer support to San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day and its campaign against California State Senator John Brigg's attempts to stop gay rights supporters' teaching in schools. It was also intended to protest the Australian visit of homophobic Festival of Light campaigner Mary Whitehouse.\n\nSydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is one of Australia's most famous and well-loved events, bringing thousands of visitors to Sydney to join in the celebrations. It captures the imagination of Australia's LGBTQI and mainstream communities, taking over the city for weeks on end, culminating in the world-famous parade: a colorful and dazzling night of pride, celebration and self-expression.\n\nIn October 2016, Minus 18 organised the first Australian LGBT History Month in partnership with the Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives, and the Safe Schools Coalition Victoria.\n\nLGBT History Month was celebrated in Hungary for the first time in February 2013, and since then every year. The program series is coordinated by Háttér Society and Labrisz Lesbian Association, events are organized in partnership with other LGBT organization, cultural and academic institutions, professional organizations etc. The majority of the events take place in Budapest, but a few events are also organized in larger cities all over the country, e.g. in Debrecen, Pécs, Miskolc and Szeged.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17836948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17836948", "title": "Lafayette Morehouse", "text": "Lafayette Morehouse\n\nLafayette Morehouse is an intentional community conceived in 1968 in Lafayette, California. The lifestyle it practices is often referred to as “Morehouse”. Inspired by its founder Dr. Victor Baranco and his first wife Dr. Suzanne Baranco, and now by his widow Dr. Cynthia Baranco, Morehouse has been a continuous experiment in group living for nearly 50 years, one of few intentional communities still existing from the 1960s.\n\nResidents of Lafayette Morehouse consider themselves to be social researchers studying the nature of pleasurable group living. They believe that group living best fits the nature of humans and can lead to the most enjoyable life. Victor Baranco recognized that to sustain a cohesive group it was imperative to handle communication, sensuality and decision-making. Those areas became among their topics of research. The group’s findings are presented to the public in the form of courses, and the group receives no outside funding that could bias its findings.\n\nThe cornerstone of the “More philosophy” is the concept of perfection - the belief that people and situations are right the way they are and that perfection includes the potential for change. This includes the viewpoint that individuals are totally responsible for their lives, including thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\n\nThe term “More” is used in the sense that “if the world is good, then more can only mean better.” Residents consider themselves to be “responsible hedonists” - with the idea that the best possible life includes concern for the welfare of others and that apparent pleasure at the expense of others is not pleasure. This viewpoint is expressed in a quote from Dr. Baranco: “Fun is the goal; love is the way.”\n\nThe community was founded by Dr. Victor Baranco (son of the Oakland jazz pianist Wilbert Baranco), a self-made millionaire who had achieved “the American dream” but was still looking for more in life. One night in 1966 he deliberately examined his life and concluded that he and everything in the world were perfect and that he was responsible for everything that had happened to him. Based on this realization, in 1968 he conceived of the Morehouse lifestyle as one in which people could live together pleasurably without doing anything they didn’t want to do, while serving the world unselfishly and profiting by it.\n\nSince its inception, Lafayette Morehouse has conducted extensive research in how a group can live together pleasurably, including groups as small as two, focusing on topics such as lifestyles, communication, coupled relationships, and sensuality. While sensuality was only one among many areas of investigation, this was the topic for which the group became best known. Their investigations of female equality and the importance of the clitoris in female orgasm were pioneering in the late 1960s and 1970s, and these findings were sometimes sensationalized in the press. The group gained notoriety for the 1976 public demonstrations of a woman in continuous orgasm for three hours, which it claims were the first known demonstrations of that kind. The group has since trained many people to this standard.\n\nThe findings of their social experiments were initially presented as courses under the auspices of the Institute of Human Abilities. In 1977 the State of California adopted laws to encourage and regulate new educational institutions, and More University was created as a DBA of Lafayette Morehouse Inc., a for-profit corporation that had been formed in 1972. More University was authorized to grant bachelor of humanities degrees, master’s degrees in communication, as well as doctoral degrees in lifestyles and sensuality, with the faculty drawn from senior members of the group. It completely complied with the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 1977 as a “State Authorized” university. Although criticized as a “diploma mill,” over a 20-year period it granted degrees to fewer than 90 people. In 1997, responding to a change in the law, Lafayette Morehouse declined to pursue recertification of the University under the new rules, and More University was dissolved. No further degrees were granted and the group resumed doing business as Lafayette Morehouse, with much of the same curriculum.\n\nSince Victor Baranco’s death in 2002, Dr. Cynthia Baranco, his widow and constant companion of 27 years, has led the group in continuing its social research, adding new courses to the curriculum and a feminine voice to the group’s teaching. On July 14, 2018 the community will celebrate its 50th anniversary.\n\nOver the years a substantial number of communal living experiments using Morehouse principles have been conducted. Most of these have been in northern California, but related communities have also been located in New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Hawaii, and other states. At this time the primary community is in Lafayette, CA, and there is also a Morehouse in Oakland, CA.\n\nThe everyday goal is to live pleasurably with one’s friends. The group has found that people who live deliberately and with awareness enjoy more fun relationships, which have tended to endure and deepen in intimacy. Residents pursue their individual goals with the support of the group. Residents also share group goals and participate in group activities, such as maintenance of the property, entertaining family and friends, putting on courses and holiday celebrations.\n\nPeople have their own money and make contributions to communal expenses, goals, and projects. Some residents have jobs outside of Morehouse.\n\nOne group goal is taking care of the less fortunate. Residents are encouraged to include this as an ongoing part of their lives, according to the viewpoint that the best life includes serving the world unselfishly.\n\nAccording to their website, “There is no label regarding sexual choices that applies across the board for our group. Sexual preference is a personal choice. Some people here are celibate, many are monogamous and some have more than one partner.” Residents adhere to a strict sexual health screening program, begun in the late 1970s, to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThe political expression of the More philosophy is called the one no-vote, a decision-making system in which any participant, regardless of age, gender, time with the community, or any other factor can cast an irrevocable “no-vote” which stops any proposed new action. This system is meant to encourage open communication and ensure that all voices are heard and considered before moving forward.\n\nThe business of Lafayette Morehouse Inc. relies on word of mouth, without advertising. The courses, in which research findings are presented, are held at various locations and produce income for communally-held goals, communal financial obligations and the ongoing research. Course topics include pleasurable interpersonal relationships, effective communication, alternative lifestyles, jealousy, money, philosophical viewpoints on perfection, and a gratifying sensual life. “It is not our goal to have others live as we do, but rather to offer our findings so that our students can use whatever elements they find beneficial. Those situations that all people encounter and must resolve in order to have happy, fulfilling lives are addressed in these courses.”\n\nOne source estimates that, as of 1997, over 100,000 people had taken at least one Lafayette Morehouse course, and over 1,000 people had lived in a Morehouse and participated in the social research.\n\nMore University was criticized for not having the faculty and facilities of a conventional university. According to a 1994 article in \"Heterodoxy\", the choice of faculty was criticized as being too insular. The New York Times stated that it had neither campus nor library. It also described the degrees as “worthless” and listed the school along with correspondence courses, with the implication that the university was a diploma mill.\n\nOne widely cited criticism of Victor Baranco and the Morehouse community was in David Felton's book \"Mindfuckers\". The section on Baranco was repackaged from two Rolling Stone articles, and the principle allegation was that he profited excessively by having group members pay to live in houses while renovating them. It was reported that Jann Wenner, the editor of Rolling Stone, said the material on Baranco was written to personally attack Baranco. These allegations against Baranco have not been repeated since 1972.\n\nMany journalists have described Morehouse as a “sex commune” or “sex cult,” focusing on the group’s sexual research and courses taught on sexual topics.\n\nThe group has been criticized for having poor relationships with its neighbors. Most of these criticisms date to the period of time (1991 – 2000) in which the group opened its doors and provided food and shelter to a large number of homeless people as their guests, using military surplus tents. Neighbors were angered by the influx of unattractive people, and the county sought to enforce zoning codes to end the activity. The group argued it was their right to use their own home to take care of people that were homeless. In an effort to mute extensive criticism in the press, the group undertook a lawsuit against the San Francisco Chronicle, which they lost. After a long court battle with Contra Costa County, Lafayette Morehouse was ordered to take down the tents.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18497", "title": "Lost Generation", "text": "Lost Generation\n\nThe Lost Generation was the generation that came of age during World War I. Demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe outlined their Strauss–Howe generational theory using 1883–1900 as birth years for them. The term was coined by Gertrude Stein and popularized by Ernest Hemingway, who used it as one of two contrasting epigraphs for his novel \"The Sun Also Rises.\" Hemingway credits the phrase to Gertrude Stein, who was then his mentor and patron.\n\n In \"A Moveable Feast\" (1964), published after Hemingway's and Stein's deaths, Hemingway writes that Stein heard the phrase from a garage owner who serviced Stein's car. When a young mechanic failed to repair the car quickly enough, the garage owner shouted at the boy, \"You are all a \"génération perdue.\" Stein, in telling Hemingway the story, added, \"That is what you are. That's what you all are ... all of you young people who served in the war. You are a lost generation.\" \n\nLost in this respect means disoriented, wandering, directionless—a recognition that there was great confusion and aimlessness among the war's survivors in the early post-war years.\"\n\nThe 1926 publication of Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises\" popularized the term as Hemingway used it as an epigraph. The novel serves to epitomize the post-war expatriate generation. However, Hemingway later wrote to his editor Max Perkins that the \"point of the book\" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that \"the earth abideth forever\"; he believed the characters in \"The Sun Also Rises\" may have been \"battered\" but were not lost.\n\nIn his memoir \"A Moveable Feast\", published after his death, he writes \"I tried to balance Miss Stein's quotation from the garage owner with one from Ecclesiastes.\"A few lines later, recalling the risks and losses of the war, he adds: \"I thought of Miss Stein and Sherwood Anderson and egotism and mental laziness versus discipline and I thought 'who is calling who a lost generation?\n\nThe writings of the Lost Generation literary figures tended to have common themes. These themes mostly pertained to the writers' experiences in World War I and the years following it. It is said that the work of these writers was autobiographical based on their use of mythologized versions of their lives. One of the themes that commonly appears in the authors' works is decadence and the frivolous lifestyle of the wealthy. Both Hemingway and Fitzgerald touched on this theme throughout the novels \"The Sun Also Rises\" and \"The Great Gatsby\". Another theme commonly found in the works of these authors was the death of the American dream, which is exhibited throughout many of their novels. It is particularly prominent in \"The Great Gatsby\", in which the character Nick Carraway comes to realize the corruption that surrounds him.\n\nThe term is also used in a broader context for the generation of young people who came of age during and shortly after World War I. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, well known for their generational theory, define the Lost Generation as the cohort born from 1883 to 1900, who came of age during World War I and the Roaring Twenties. In Europe, they are mostly known as the \"Generation of 1914\", for the year World War I began. In France, the country in which many expatriates settled, they were sometimes called the \"Génération au Feu\", the \"Generation in Flames\". In Great Britain, the term was originally used for those who died in the war, and often implicitly referred to upper-class casualties who were perceived to have died disproportionately, robbing the country of a future elite.

It consists of the letters L and O over the letters V and E in bold Didone type; the O is slanted sideways so that its oblong negative space creates a line leading to the V. The original image, with green and blue spaces backing red lettering, served as a print image for a Museum of Modern Art Christmas card in 1964. In much this same form the design soon graced a popular US postage stamp.\n\n\"Love\"s original rendering in sculpture was made in 1970 and is displayed in Indiana at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The material is COR-TEN steel. Indiana's \"Love\" design has since been reproduced in a variety of formats for rendering in displays around the world.\n\nMoMA historian Deborah Wye describes Indiana's image as \"full of erotic, religious, autobiographical, and political underpinnings\" that make it \"both accessible and complex in meaning. Megan Wilde offered more detail about the autobiographical origins in an article for \"Mental Floss\" magazine, \"[T]he word \"love\" was connected to [the artist's] childhood experiences attending a Christian Science church, where the only decoration was the wall inscription \"God is Love\". The colors were an homage to his father, who worked at a Phillips 66 gas station during the Depression\". She quotes Robert Indiana as describing the original colors as \"the red and green of that sign against the blue Hoosier sky\".\n\nIndiana's image was quickly adapted upon its appearance in the 1960s by the hippie free love movement and again in the 1990s by skateboard enthusiasts after skateboarding was banned in Philadelphia's Love Park.\n\nVersions of the sculpture now exist in Hebrew, Chinese, Italian and Spanish, as well as the original English.\n\nThe image has been rendered and parodied in many forms. After the 1964 MoMA card, one of the early commercial uses of the image was on the LP cover of the 1967 studio recording of Olivier Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony, featuring the Toronto Symphony Orchestra conducted by Seiji Ozawa (RCA LSC-7051). The original book cover for Erich Segal's novel \"Love Story\" alluded to the design, and the TV series \"Bridget Loves Bernie\" included a shot of the Sixth Avenue sculpture in its opening credits. The first opening sequence of the \"Skip Beat!\" anime includes the image in the initial frames. The United States Post Office issued an eight-cent stamp in 1973 featuring the image. Parodies of the image appeared on covers of records by Rage Against the Machine (\"Renegades\"), Oasis (\"Little by Little\" single) and Acen Razvi (\"75 Minutes\"). London artist D*Face parodied the image by rendering the word \"hate\" with the \"A\" tilted and Belgian artist Eddy Gabriel made a version using the word \"lost\". The sculpture is remade to read \"THPS\" in the Xbox expansion of \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2\", which has a stage set in Philadelphia's Love Park. The set reappears in \"Tony Hawk's Underground 2\".\n\nIn 2003, the iconic letters were painted on a tennis court next to the Nike SF-89L Nuclear Missile Site behind the abandoned Public Health Service Hospital in the Presidio of San Francisco, California. According to conceptual artist, Erik Seidenglanz, the letters are proportional to the tennis court, identical to Robert Indiana's \"Love\" typography are painted in white and a mirror image of it. This \"Love\" court can be found in the History Imagery timeline of Google Earth\n\nOn February 14, 2011, Google posted a special Valentine's Day edition of its logo based on the famous image.\n"}

These businesses benefit and profit from cheap prison labor, food services, medical services, surveillance technology, and construction. The financial incentive of building prisons encourages incarceration and affects people of color at disproportionally high rates. Native Americans are the largest group per capita in the US prison system and are more likely to affected by police violence than any other racial group. \n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, Native Americans are incarcerated at a rate 38% higher than the national average. In 19 states, Indigenous people are overrepresented in the prison population compared to any other race and ethnicity.. In South Dakota, Native people represent 5% of the total population, while 29% are under the prison system. In Alaska, data published by the 2010 US Census reveal that 38% of incarcerated people are American Indian or Alaskan Native while only 15% of the total population is. In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians only make up 24% of the general population. However, they account for 39% of the incarcerated population according to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Native youth are highly impacted by the US prison system; despite accounting for 1% of the national youth population, 70% of youth taken into federal prison are Native American. Native American men are admitted to prison at four times the rate of white men while Native women are admitted at 6 times the rate of white women.\n\nDue to a complicated legal history of the United States interceding and dismantling tribal justice systems, tribal governments have much more limited jurisdiction compared to federal justice systems and US state systems. The Major Crimes Act in 1885, Public Law 280 in 1953, The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the case law of Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe in 1978 are some of the first historic laws among many passed by the United States government to gain federal control over native nations. This has disrupted the autonomy of tribal justice systems today and has caused the crime on Native reservations to often be prosecuted under federal law which entails more severe sentencing than state law for the same crime. Non-native criminals including sexual predators and drug traffickers have taken advantage of the unclear chain of authority on Native lands. This disjuncture between federal government jurisdiction and tribal government jurisdiction allows non-native criminals to avoid punishment while Native members are subjected to sexual and drug violence.\n\nPolice brutality against Native Americans contributes greatly to the rising incarceration rates and deaths of Native people. While Native Americans only make up 1.2% of the total population in the US, Natives experience higher rates of death due to police violence than any other racial group. Native Americans are 3 times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police.\n\nThe \"Native Lives Matter\" campaign is a grassroots group advocating for awareness and justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women and Native lives killed by police violence. The campaign was established in 2014 by Akicita Sunka-Wakan Ska from the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux Tribes and JR Bobick from St. Paul, Minnesota. This campaign uses social media like Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness about issues affecting the Native population, such as police brutality, high incarceration, and missing murdered indigenous women. The campaign believes ways to lessen and end police brutality and high incarceration rates include hiring a police force that better represents Native communities. This would allow for more cultural understanding and lead to less racial profiling against tribal nations by police enforcement. Native Lives Matter also believes that cultural healing programs could address and eventually lessen police brutality by fostering an understanding of mental health, addiction, and poverty which contribute to high police presence. Other social justice groups like \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Idle No More\" have called attention to the numerous deaths of Native people due to police violence.\n"}
{"id": "19818973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19818973", "title": "Nuo opera", "text": "Nuo opera\n\nNuo opera or Nuo drama () is one of the most popular folk operas in southern China. Characterized by its special features such as ferocious masks, unique dresses and adornments, the strange language used in performance, and mysterious scenes, Nuo opera has been selected as one of the non-material cultural legacies of China. The opera is a religious performance intrinsic to the culture of Nuoism, a type of Chinese folk religion. The purpose of Nuo opera is to drive away devils, disease and evil influences, and also to petition for blessings from the gods. Singing and dancing are included in Nuo opera and performers wear costumes and masks.\n\nNuo opera is a direct and important expressive medium of Nuo culture. Other forms of representation of the Nuo culture include Nuo dance (傩舞/儺舞), Nuo song (傩歌/儺歌), Nuo sacrifice (傩祭) and Nuo ceremony (傩仪/儺儀) and others. The unique symbol of Nuo opera, the masks, are considered a treasure of Chinese folk art.\n\nThere is a considerable repertoire in Nuo opera and this varies from area to area. Nuo operas are usually based on well-known Chinese historical events or folk stories such as \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", \"Journey to the West\", \"Water Margin\" and the story of the Dragon Kings. Some famous repertoires of Nuo opera include \"Lady Mengjiang\", \"Seizing the Yellow Devil\", and \"Story of Mount Liang\".\n\nDuring the Zhou dynasty (11th century-256 BC), this art form was very popular in the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Nenjiang River valleys . However, the opera's popularity waned in those river valley areas. Nowadays, it still remains popular among rural areas in southwest China, such as Guizhou, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is especially popular in the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities such as the Tujia, the Miao, the Dong and Yao.\n\n\"Nuo\" means an oath, binding utterance, or exorcism in Chinese religious culture. The Chinese character for \"nuo\" is \"傩\" in simplified Chinese or \"儺\" in traditional Chinese. This is a very uncommon character in modern Chinese. The meaning of the character \"Nuo\" is a patterned step to drive away the devil during the last month of the Chinese lunar new year. The Chinese character for \"opera\" is \"戏\" in simplified Chinese or \"戲\" in traditional Chinese.\n\nThe Nuo opera is a kind of folk dramatic art that originated from a primordial religion. In the \"Analects of Confucius\", \"villager Nuo\" (or village Nuo) was mentioned. The \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" mentions that there was also a custom that whenever there was a celebration, grand Nuo (or royal Nuo) would be a necessity.\n\nThe primitive form, dating back to antiquity, of Nuo opera is \"Nuoji\" (simplified: 傩祭; traditional: 儺祭), which is a special sacrificial ceremony. \"Ji\" means sacrifice or sacrificial activities and events. While performing religious rites, people pray to ward off disasters and receive good luck. So, \"Nuoji\" was formed as a sacrificial activity or ceremony to worship gods and ancestors. The exact date when \"Nuoji\" was formed is unknown, but the Nuo ceremony was first recorded on oracle bones during the Shang dynasty (17th-11th century BC), and flourished in the Zhou dynasty (11th century-256BC).\n\nIn the Zhou dynasty, \"Nuoji\" was already very popular within the central parts of its territory. \"Nuoji\" was performed during festivals and holidays at that time with the purpose of driving away devils and plague. \"Nuoji\" was a very important social, political, and religious event and a specific government department was established to be in charge of \"Nuoji\". At the time, besides the grand Nuo ceremony held by the royal court, the folk Nuo ceremony also appeared in the countryside.\n\nDuring and after the Tang dynasty (618-907), \"Nuoji\" gradually developed into a dance drama and became more of a recreation than a ritual. It became a masked drama enacted by a priest performing an exorcism, and has been described as \"theater with a presentational aspect, a festival, and the idea of gatherings to establish ties and norms.\" The rituals have been incorporated into people's lives and are seen as commentaries on Chinese life.\n\nAround the Song dynasty (960–1279), people started to perform with masks during \"Nuoji\"; thus Nuo opera was basically formed. During the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), Nuo opera, which had separated from \"Nuoji\", had become a unique performing art. During the 1930s and 1940s, Nuo opera began to be performed in busy cities and towns.\n\nToday, the popularity of Nuo opera has declined and it can normally only be seen during the Spring Festival and other important traditional Chinese holidays, in remote mountainous areas, such as Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Anhui provinces, inhabited mostly by minority ethnic groups.\n\nAfter the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the influence and popularity of Nuo opera was suppressed by the Chinese government, because the superstitious elements in Nuo opera were contrary to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China which advocated atheism.\n\nRecently (probably after the year 2000), scholars from both China and abroad started becoming interested in \"nuo\" opera again because of its precious historical value. Nuoism has been promoted by the Chinese government as a matrix of ethnic identity, especially of the Tujia people.\n\nNuo opera varies greatly from place to place because local culture and customs have a great influence on the form, masks, costumes and conventions of Nuo opera. Generally, Nuo opera can be categorized as follows: Guizhou, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Yunnan .\n\nGuizhou is the center of Nuo drama in southwestern China due to its long Nuo opera history and abundant repertoire. In Anshun, a city in Guizhou, \"nuo\" opera is the primary entertainment activity . Musical instruments include one gong and one drum. The drummer has a very important role during a performance. A patch of land serves as a stage. As a result, Guizhou Nuo is also called \"Dixi\" (ground opera).\n\nThe only two occasions for the performance of Nuo opera are at the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) and at the middle of the 7th lunar month, the time of the rice harvest. People hope the Nuo opera can drive away bad luck and bring a good harvest. Year after year, numerous locals are attracted to this performance. Sometimes a drama can last a dozen days. As is true in most other areas, Nuo Drama in Tunbu is the performed by the men. The moment a dancer puts on his mask, he will not speak or act casually since putting on a mask means the spirit is on him already.\n\nJiangxi (江西) Nuo is usually called Gan Nuo as Gan (赣 贛) is the abbreviation of Jiangxi Province. Nuo opera is most popular in the counties of Nanfeng and Shangli in Jiangxi. From late Qing Dynasty to now, there were about 150 Nuo opera performing groups. A temple for the \"Nuo\" god, which was built in the Ming Dynasty and still functions well today for people to worship the \"Nuo\" god. About 80 Nuo opera programs from the past still exist today. The number of Nuo opera masks in Jiangxi is over 2000, and there are approximately 2000 professional Nuo opera performing folk artists . In Shangli county, a popular saying says that, in ancient times, there was a Nuo god every five kilometers. Therefore, Shangli county preserves over 20 Nuo god temples.\n\nNuo dancing, one of the most ancient arts and a necessary element in Nuo opera, has existed in Nanfeng, Jiangxi for over 2000 years. The movements of Nanfeng Nuo dancing are simple but powerful, retaining their ancient characters. Nanfeng Nuo dancing was even regarded as \"The Active fossil of Chinese dancing Art\". In 1996, Nanfeng county was called \"The village of Chinese folk Art-Nuo Art\" by National Culture Department of China.\n\nAnhui (安徽) Nuo is special because it is performed on a clan basis and not by a troupe as in other places. Chizhou Nuo is the best known Nuo opera of Anhui Nuo. The origins of Nuo culture in Chizhou areas is one of the most ancient and can be traced back over thousands of years to the neolithic period. It has been recently included in the Nation’s First Catalogue of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Chizhou Nuo Opera is divided into three performing formats: Nuo Ritual. Nuo Dancing and Nuo Drama. The complete stage performance must be mixed with dramatic plot, role-playing, type of role, and qiemo (settings, scene and props). The performing skill can only be learned through oral instruction and the personal teachings passed on to disciples in person from generation to generation. Therefore, the performing art of Nuo opera is normally passed on within a clan from generation to generation. There may be two sacrificial ceremonies (in which the Nuo opera are performed as a must) a year: the \"spring sacrificial ceremony\" that is held sometime between the seventh day to the fifteenth day of the first lunar month and the \"autumn sacrificial ceremony\" that is held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. Apart from these two ceremonies, there is no performance at all throughout the year.\n\nThe dance, which has a strong local flavor, continues in many villages in Guichi County of Chizhou today. Surrounded in the mist of incense and smoke, Nuo dancers, colorfully dressed, walk on stilts and wear masks while performing, expressing their wishes of sacrifice to their ancestors, praying for blessing and dispelling evil. While performing in mountainous villages, dancers have to put masks on their foreheads, letting the audiences who are standing on the surrounding slopes to see them clearly. To accompany the dancing, the music instruments range from drum, bell, earthen bowl, bamboo flute and Suona. There is a popular saying among Chizhou area that a village would not be considered a village without Nuo opera.\n\nWhen Chizhou Nuo Opera is performed, it normally has three integrated components: Nuo dancing, main performance, and salutatory &and complimentary remarks. Some of the well-known repertoire of Chizhou Nuo are \"Liu Wenlong\", \"Meng Jiangnü\", \"Fan Silking\" and \"Zhang Wenxian\" etc.\n\nLeopard Nuo opera in Chuxiong City, Yunnan, differentiates itself by the fact that all dancers are painted with a leopard pattern on their nude bodies. The ferocious and agile leopard is regarded as the most qualified to drive away devils. Leopards are played by twelve Yi boys about 10 years old. On the morning of the performance, young dancers will have the leopard pattern painted on their backs, hands, feet, and belly in black, white, red, and yellow colors. A yue-kin, a four-stringed plucked instrument with a full-moon-shaped sound box, is painted on their chests. Their faces are covered with palm leaves, and their heads are decorated with two pheasant tails. When the make-up is finished, dancers enter the role of leopards, prohibiting further talking.\n\nVillage rooftops connected by ladders or wood panels form the stage for the \"leopards.\" At the climax of the dance, leopards run after young girls watching the show until the girls take them home, where snacks have been prepared. Leopards eat some snacks as well as throwing some away, while continuing to dance. This devil-dispelling activity is performed in the rooms, kitchens and stalls of one family after another; the leopards dispel devils for all the villagers.\n\nIn the film \"Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles\" directed by Zhang Yimou, Yunnan Nuo is prominently depicted and featured.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Nuo opera is that the performers wear masks. Different roles require different masks to reveal the characters, through their changing facial features and decorations. The masks are highly aesthetic. The art, selected materials, colors and applications of Nuo opera masks vary among the regions, ethnic groups, culture and aesthetic interests. That distinctiveness adds the masks' beauty. The masks are mainly made of poplar and willow since poplar is light and less prone to cracks, while willow is widely regarded as having the power to ward off evil. Nuo opera involves many acrobatic performances, such as getting into a hot pot, holding burned stones, crossing a fiery pit, swallowing and blowing fire, and stepping on a mountain of swords. As most of the performers are specially trained, they are good at giving exciting performances.\n\nThe number of masks used in one drama ranges from several dozen to two hundred. There are five kinds of masks used in Nuo Drama, namely: civilian general, military general, old general, young general and woman general with other minor roles such as soldiers and Taoist monks. Each nuo mask has a fixed name, represents a certain role and has legendary stories to tell of its origins. In Guizhou, a province with the largest nuo drama repertoire, at least 24 masks are required to perform an entire nuo drama piece. The masks can appear valiant and martial, stern and tough, or gentle and kind, and they come in various styles to represent different figures. For instance, since the responsibility of valiant gods is to emit awe and dispel ghosts and devils, their masks usually have horns and buckteeth, with a very ferocious countenance.\n\nThe masks are endowed with mysterious religious and cultural meanings, both in Nuoji and Nuo opera performances. People in Nuo culture circles, who regard the masks as symbols and carriers of gods, observe various rules and conventions. For instance, the ceremony of enshrining a Buddha statue is held before making the masks; before using them, the ceremony of opening the case; and storing them, the ceremony of sealing the case. According to the rules, women are not allowed to touch or wear the masks, and only men can produce, use and store masks. Once a man wears a mask, he is supposed to be possessed by a god or spirit. And therefore, he must not speak.\n\nStudies also show that the face painting of Beijing opera and face changing of Sichuan opera were influenced by Nuo opera masks.\n\n\nMin Tian, \"Chinese Nuo and Japanese Noh: Nuo's Role in the Origination and Formation of Noh,\" Comparative Drama, Vol. 37, No. 3/4 (Fall/Winter 2003-04), pp. 343–360.\n\n"}

She rejected genetics and was an advocate of spontaneous generation of life from inanimate matter.\n\nLepeshinskaya completed her study as a feldsher in St. Petersburg in 1887 and practised at various places in Siberia. She joined a Marxist group in St Petersburg in 1894, and married a fellow Marxist, Panteleimon Nikolaievich Lepeshinsky (1868-1944), a priest's son who was expelled from St Petersburg University in 1895 for his political activities. They were both arrested and exiled in 1897, for three years, to Yermakovsk, in Siberia, 20 miles from Minussinsk, where Lenin was in exile. Both became loyal supporters of Lenin, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) when it was founded, in 1898, and after Lenin had launched the newspaper \"Iskra\", they acted as its agents in Pskov, in north west Russia, until 1903, when they emigrated to Geneva and opened a cafe, which was the main meeting point for the Bolsheviks who supported Lenin at a time when he was outnumbered among the Russian exiles by the Mensheviks and under pressure to settle the rift within the RSDLP. According to one witness who was in Geneva at the time, Lepeshinsky \"worshipped Lenin rather as a sentimental schoolgirl worships her teachers\", whereas she was \"a very formidable and businesslike woman, who uttered with great aplomp the most simplistic opinions...Her general level of education was nothing to boast of, and at that time she showed no special interest in science, or biology.\" Lenin's opinion was that \"Panteleimon won't got far wrong with her.\" The couple returned to Russia to take part in the 1905 revolution, but after its failure, they gave up political activity and took up teaching. In 1915, she completed her medical training in Moscow. \n\nLepeshinskaya was a participant in the October Revolution. She lectured at the University of Medicine in Moscow until 1926, briefly interrupted by a 1919 stay at the Tashkent University, then worked at the Kliment Timiryazev Institute of Biology. In 1941 she became the head of the Department of Live Matter at the Institute of Experimental Biology, USSR Academy of Medical Sciences for the remainder of her career.\n\nLepeshinskaya worked well into her eighties and died in Moscow at the age of 92 from pneumonia.\n\nIn the 1920s Lepeshinskaya discredited the work of her supervisor, Alexander Gurvitch, who investigated biophotons and mitogenic rays. She claimed that low doses of ultraviolet light were released by dying cells that had been treated with high doses of UV light. Later she claimed that cells could propagate by disintegration into granules which could generate new forms of cells, different from the parental cells. Also, crystals of inorganic matter could be converted into cells by adding nucleic acids. Further, she espoused spontaneous generation and the presence of a \"vital substance\". These claims were propagated as official dogma in the Soviet Union. A claim that soda baths fostered rejuvenation led to a temporary shortage of baking soda. She based her career on claims to observe \"de novo\" emergence of living cells from non-cellular materials, supporting such claims by fabricated proofs which were \"confirmed\" by others eager to advance in the politicized scientific system. Actually, she filmed the death and subsequent decomposition of cells, then projected these films reversed. \n\nIn May 22–24, 1950 at the special symposium \"Live Matter and Cell Development\" for the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences that was supported by Stalin and chaired by Alexander Oparin, Lepeshinskaya gave the keynote speech, and her \"discoveries\" were celebrated as revolutionary by the invited audience. She was the recipient of the Stalin Prize for that year, and her ideas became mandatory instruction in biology. In 1952 a second conference took place to demonstrate \"using experimental methods\" that the bourgeois Virchowian concept of cell development (only a living cell can produce another cell) was replaced by a \"new dialectical-materialistic theory on the origin of all living cells from non-living matter.\" While her impact and dogmatic dominance have parallels to those of Lysenko, her claims were never officially renounced but just faded away.\n\nShe involved her daughter Olga and her son-in-law Vladimir Kryukov in her work; in contrast, her husband, Panteleimon Lepechinsky, thought little of it. \"Don’t you listen to her.

The practice is proscribed by the American Medical Association, as defined in its \"Code of Medical Ethics\". The American Society of Anesthesiologists endorses this position, stating that lethal injections \"can never conform to the science, art and\npractice of anesthesiology\".\n\nIn 2010, the American Board of Anesthesiologists, a member board of the American Board of Medical Specialties, voted to revoke the certification of anesthesiologists who participate in executing a prisoner by lethal injection. Board secretary Mark A. Rockoff defended the organization's policy, stating that participation in executions \"puts anesthesiologists in an untenable position,\" and that physicians \"can assuredly provide effective anesthesia, but doing so in order to cause a patient's death is a violation of their fundamental duty as physicians to do no harm.\"\n\nIn at least one case, the planned execution of Michael Morales, the execution warrant was stayed indefinitely due to the objection of the contacted physicians to participate.\n\nThe topic was the subject of a 1992 review by the American Medical Association, entitled \"Physician Participation in Capital Punishment\".\n\nU.S. Supreme Court cases discussing the constitutionality of execution methods often involve testimony of medical professionals; one example of such a case being the 2008 \"Baze v. Rees\" case, which affirmed the constitutionality of the three-drug lethal injection protocol as a method of capital punishment, despite claims that the single drug used for animal euthanasia is more humane than the three-drug cocktail currently used.\n\nOne particular concern to opponents of physician participation in capital punishment is the role that health care providers have played in treating or reviving patients to render them fit for execution. In a 1995 Oklahoma case, death row inmate Robert Brecheen intentionally overdosed on sleeping pills hours before his scheduled lethal injection. He was immediately hospitalized and had his stomach pumped, before being returned to prison for his execution. In a similar 1997 case in Texas, David M. Long attempted suicide by drug overdose two days before his execution date and prison authorities flew him from an intensive care unit in Galveston, on a ventilator, accompanied by a full medical team, to the death chamber in Huntsville.\n\nPossibly botched executions include those of Stanley Williams, Ángel Nieves Díaz, and others. The only execution by lethal injection which failed to kill the condemned prisoner in United States occurred on September 15, 2009 in Ohio, when executioners attempted and then aborted the execution of Romell Broom, leading to the implementation of a one-drug method. More than six decades earlier, on May 3, 1946, an unsuccessful attempt at the electrocution of Willie Francis, then aged 17, led to an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to reject a second attempt at electrocuting Francis, which failed by a 5-4 vote in \"Francis v. Resweber\", resulting in Francis' successful electrocution just over a year later, on May 9, 1947.\n\nIn many of these executions, the result of the error has been that executions have taken many times as long as they should have – in one case, the execution of Christopher Newton, an execution took up to two hours to complete, fifteen times longer than average; ideally, executions should be completed within about eight minutes. Some have claimed that such executions may have induced \"excruciating pain\", a possible violation of the Eighth Amendment. This has been argued in the Supreme Court case \"Hill v. McDonough\". Errors occurring in these botched executions include the incorrect placing of IV lines, and injection of too little anaesthetic, reported in one study to have been consistent with awareness in 43% (21 executions) of the forty-nine executions in the study.\n\nSince the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976, there have been, according to one study, forty-one possibly botched executions. On, January 7, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments in \"Baze v. Rees\", a case challenging the three-drug cocktail used for many executions by lethal injection. The respondent's lawyer, Roy T. Englert, Jr., referred to the Death Penalty Information Center's list of \"botched\" executions. He criticized it because a majority of the executions on the list, according to respondent, \"did not involve the infliction of pain, but were only delayed by technical problems (\"e.g.\", difficulty in finding a suitable vein)\". However, the petitioners' attorney disagreed.\n\nSeveral states which practice capital punishment, such as Georgia and Oregon, have laws forbidding sanctions against medical professionals participating in executions. The North Carolina Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the Medical Board cannot discipline doctors who participate in executions, stating that the statutes providing for lethal injection are superior to ethical guides.\n\nThe practice is proscribed in the Hippocratic Oath, an ethical guide for the medical profession, albeit with no legal or constitutional force, which states:\n\n\n"}

Zehri succeeded Abdul Malik Baloch as chief minister Balochistan, Pakistan on 24 December 2015 as part of the power sharing deal brokered in the resort town of Murree. Zehri is the central president of the Pakistan Muslim League's Balochistan branch and a confidant of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nOn 7 June 2013, Zehri was appointed senior minister of Balochistan with portfolios of communication works, mines, minerals and industries. On 9 January 2018, due to the imminence of a no confidence vote against him, Zehri resigned from his post as Chief Minister to prevent the brewing of a political crisis.\n\nNawab Sanaullah Zehri was born in Anjeera in the Khuzdar District, Balochistan, Pakistan, on 4 August 1961. His father, Sardar Doda Khan Zehri, was a tribal leader and an activist in the Pakistan Movement who played a crucial role in gathering Balochistan's support for the cause of Pakistan. He graduated with a BA degree in political science in 1983 from the University of Balochistan.\n\nUpon graduating from Balochistan University, he ran in the 1990 Balochistan Assembly general election, performing well on the PML(N)'s conservative platform. During this time, he campaigned for local government in Balochistan. In 1997, he contested and triumphed in a senate election, representing Balochistan until 1999. Zehri ran for the PB-50 (Khuzdar-I) constituency on the National Party's platform during the 2002 general election. He served as the provincial minister of prisons and tribal affairs until 2003.\n\nIn 2008, the National Party boycotted the general elections. Zehri disagreed with the move, left the party, and in February he won a seat in the Assembly under his own, newly founded National Party Parliamentarians. In September 2006, Zehri participated in a loya jirga called by the Khan of Kalat, Mir Suleman Dawood Jan, following the death of Akbar Bugti.\n\nOn 6 January 2010, he joined the Pakistan Muslim League.

However, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif instead approved the appointment of Abdul Malik Baloch to be elevated as the Chief Minister of Balochistan.\n\nOn 16 April 2013, Zehri escaped an assassination attempt on his life when his convey came under a bomb attack in his native Khuzdar district. The attack killed his son, Sikander Zehri, brother Mir Meharullah Zehri and nephew Mir Zaid.

{"id": "54299694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54299694", "title": "Shooting bias", "text": "Shooting bias\n\nThe term shooting bias, also known as \"shooter bias\", is a form of implicit racial bias which refers to the tendency among the police to shoot black civilians rather than white civilians, even when they are unarmed.\n\nThe probability of being shot by the police depends on factors such as ethnicity, location, the income of the neighborhood and whether or not the person is carrying a weapon as well as the emotions shown by the victim.\n\nPolice data could be biased due to police reporting practices. Departments can voluntary include justifiable homicides in the crime statistics of the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, which means that a lot of departments don't provide data at all. Some cities haven't reported their data in years. This means that the official data doesn't accurately reflect the number of civilians that are shot by the police.\n\nNewspapers like \"The Guardian\" and \"The Washington Post\" have started gathering a database of fatal police shootings, revealing that in 2015 twice as many civilians had been fatally shot than the FBI's data suggested. An FBI working group has started working on a proposal for making the reports more accurate, but they would still rely on voluntary data and therefore wouldn't fix the main reporting issue.\n\nThe database developed by \"The Guardian\" is currently the largest database on fatal shootings available. They gather data through police reports, monitoring of regional news, fact-checked witness statements and other crowdsourced police fatality databases.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Guardian\" counted 1093 people who were killed by the police in the United States. Out of these 574 were white and 266 were black. 95 of the white victims were unarmed, 42 of the black victims were unarmed.\n\nMore white than black people are shot. It is important to distinguish to differentiate between the number of deaths of an ethnic group and the likelihood of being shot by police. The likelihood of being shot as a black rather than a white person is higher, whether the victim is armed or not.\n\nProminent examples of unarmed black civilians being fatally shot by the police include: \n\n\nA study carried out at the University of California found \"evidence of a significant bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans compared to unarmed white Americans\". In this study, the probability of being shot by the police as a black, unarmed person versus as a white, unarmed person was 3.49 times higher. Unarmed Hispanics' likelihood to be shot was 1.67 times higher than for unarmed Whites.\n\nThe number vary greatly depending on the county, sometimes reaching a probability of 20 to 1 or more for unarmed blacks to be shot. There are several maps that showcase the distribution of fatal shootings across the country.\n\nContrary to popular belief, crime rate was not associated with likelihood of being shot in this study.\n\nEmpirical research suggests the following factors to influence the decision to shoot: \n\nAn implicit racial bias refers to unintentional judgments a person makes of a group (e.g. good/bad) of a certain ethnicity. So a person who shows implicit racial bias might not be aware of it. Police officers have been found to show a racial bias against black people in the decision to shoot.\n\nIn one of the studies, researchers investigated how stereotypes affected police officers' decisions to shoot. They used a video game and exposed their participants to pictures of either Whites or Non-Whites who were armed or unarmed. During this video game, the participants were asked to choose between \"shoot\" or \"don't shoot\" as quickly as possible. The results were that the participants shot armed black people faster than armed white people and chose \"don't shoot\" faster for unarmed white than unarmed black persons.\n\nThe authors explained those findings by the activation of stereotype thinking which lead white people to associate black people with danger. Because of this stereotype, the participants expected blacks to carry a gun and therefore were quicker to make the \"shooting\" decision. Other studies have found similar results. The time pressure to make a decision in decisions to shoot might magnify the effects of racial bias.\n\nThe American police officers live and work in a society full of prejudices against minorities. In addition, police officers usually deal with high crime rates in minority neighborhoods. These experiences reinforce their existing prejudices by ignoring that most people with a non-white ethnic background don’t become criminals. This leads to discrimination against minorities. Other factors that lead to discrimination by the police are institutionalized language barriers between police and some ethnic groups, experiences with disrespectful or hostile residents in certain minority neighborhoods and low punishment for police officers who misbehave towards minorities.\n\nThose prejudices by the police are of course being noticed by the groups of minorities. So in return, the groups believe that the officers have prejudices against them. This might lead to the findings that Non-Whites are more likely to behave disrespectfully or to insult officers.\n\nTo sum up, there may exist a mutual influence between the prejudices that police officers have against minorities and the prejudices that minorities have against officers.\n\n\nPossibly the biggest change could be made by holding police officers accountable for their actions. Internal investigations usually don't lead to punishments. The work culture within the police is highly racist, as many recent scandals have shown.\n\nKnowing the factors that influence police officers decisions to shoot there are a few possible solutions for reducing shooting bias. The main factor is implicit racial bias, which in turn is exuberated by certain factors that could be addressed.\n\nDiversity in police departments might not reduce shooting bias, but reducing fatigue might lower the impact of racial bias on the decision to shoot. Changing the training of police officers so as to not showcase black armed targets more often than white ones could help reduce racial bias.\n\nTraining police officers in making decisions under stress as well as assigning officers to certain locations so they can become familiar with its residents could reduce the numbers of civilians killed, says Richmond's police chief, Chris Magnus.\n\nRacial bias can be contagious within a social group or neighborhood. Training police officers to be aware of this might help in reducing this effect.\n"}

{"id": "477269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477269", "title": "Trial by media", "text": "Trial by media\n\nTrial by media is a phrase popular in the late 20th century and early 21st century to describe the impact of television and newspaper coverage on a person's reputation by creating a widespread perception of guilt or innocence before, or after, a verdict in a court of law. Its first inception was the phrase \"Trial by Television\" which found light in the response to the 3 February, 1967 television broadcast of The Frost Programme, host David Frost. The confrontation and Frost's personal adversarial line of questioning of insurance fraudster Emil Savundra led to concern from ITV executives that it might affect Savundra's right to a fair trial.\n\nDuring high-publicity court cases, the media are often accused of provoking an atmosphere of public hysteria akin to a lynch mob which not only makes a fair trial nearly impossible but means that regardless of the result of the trial the accused will not be able to live the rest of their life without intense public scrutiny.\n\nThe counter-argument is that the mob mentality exists independently of the media which merely voices the opinions which the public already has.\n\nAlthough a recently coined phrase, the idea that popular media can have a strong influence on the legal process goes back certainly to the advent of the printing press and probably much further. This is not including the use of a state controlled press to criminalize political opponents, but in its commonly understood meaning covers all occasions where the reputation of a person has been drastically affected by ostensibly non-political publications.\n\nOften the coverage in the press can be said to reflect the views of the person in the street. However, more credibility is generally given to printed material than 'water cooler gossip'. The responsibility of the press to confirm reports and leaks about individuals being tried has come under increasing scrutiny and journalists are calling for higher standards. There was much debate over U.S President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial and prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation and how the media handled the trial by reporting commentary from lawyers which influenced public opinion.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, strict contempt of court regulations restrict the media's reporting of legal proceedings after a person is formally arrested. These rules are designed so that a defendant receives a fair trial in front of a jury that has not been tainted by prior media coverage. The newspapers the \"Daily Mirror\" and \"The Sun\" have been prosecuted under these regulations, although such prosecutions are rare.\n\n"}
{"id": "2849654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2849654", "title": "Women and video games", "text": "Women and video games\n\nThe relationship between women and video games has received extensive academic, corporate, and social attention. Since the 1990s, female gamers have commonly been regarded as a minority, but industry surveys have shown that in time the gender ratio has become closer to equal, and since the 2010s, women have been found to make up about half of all gamers. Sexism in video gaming, including sexual harassment and the underrepresentation of women as characters in games, is an increasing topic of discussion in video game culture.\n\nAdvocates for increasing the number of female gamers stress the problems attending disenfranchisement of women from one of the fastest-growing cultural realms as well as the largely untapped nature of the female gamer market. Efforts to include greater female participation in the medium have addressed the problems of gendered advertising, social stereotyping, and the lack of female video game creators (coders, developers, producers, etc.). The term \"girl gamer\" has been used as a reappropriated term for female players to describe themselves, but it has also been criticized as counterproductive or offensive.\n\nFemale participation in gaming is increasing. According to a Entertainment Software Association survey, women players in the United States increased from 40% in 2010 to 48% in 2014. Today, despite the dominant perception that most gamers are men, the ratio of female to male gamers is balanced, mirroring the population at large.\n\nIn 2008, a Pew Internet & American Life Project study found that among teens, 65% of men and 35% of women describe themselves as daily gamers. This trend was found to be stronger the younger the age group. The study found that while adult men are significantly more likely to play console games than adult women, on other platforms they are equally likely to play. But even in this area, the numbers are moving towards equality: in 2013, Nintendo reported that half of its users were women, and in 2015 another Pew study found that more American women (42%) than men (37%) owned video game consoles. In 2013, \"Variety\" reported that female participation increased with age (61% of women and 57% of men aged 45 to 64 played games).\n\nA mid-2015 survey reported by UKIE indicates that 42% of UK gamers are female.\n\nIn North America, national demographic surveys have been conducted yearly by the U.S. Entertainment Software Association (ESA) since at least 1997, and the Canadian Entertainment Software Association of Canada (ESAC) since 2006. Other organizations including the Australian/New-Zealander Interactive Games & Entertainment Association (IGEA) since 2005 collect and publish demographic data on their constituent populations on a semi-regular basis. In Europe, the regional Interactive Software Federation of Europe (ISFE) and numerous smaller national groups like the Belgian Entertainment Association (BEA), the Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van beeld- en geluidsdragers (NVPI), and the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) have also begun to collect data on female video gamers since 2012. One-off market research studies and culture surveys have been produced by a wide variety of other sources including some segments of the gaming press and other culture writers since the 1980s as well.\n\nNot only has the general female gaming population been tracked, but the spread of this population has been tracked over many facets of gaming. For more than 10 years, groups like the ESA and ESAC have gathered data on the gender of video game purchasers, the percentage of women gamers within certain age brackets, and the average number of years women gamers have been gaming. The ESAC in particular has gone into great depth reporting age-related segmentation of the market between both male and female gamers. Other statistics have been collected from time to time on a wide variety of facets influencing the video game market.\n\n\nWhile 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as gamers, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers. This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female PC gamers in the U.S. consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers. In 2012 a EEDAR survey found that nearly 60 percent of female gamers played on mobile devices and that 63 percent of these female mobile gamers played online multiplayer mobile games.\n\nConnotations of \"gamer\" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label. \"Girl gamers\" or \"gamer girls\" is a label for women who regularly play games. While some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term, others have described the term as unhelpful, offensive, and even harmful or misleading. The word \"girl\", for example, has been seen as an inherently age-linked term that glosses over the difference between women over 30 and younger women. The term \"girl gamer\" rather than simply \"gamer\" has also been described as perpetuating the minority position of female gamers. For many critics uncomfortable with the term \"girl gamer\", its over-embracement may lead to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes of female gamers as oversexualized, casual, and sometimes defiant or confrontational. This in turn can result in poor game design. These critics submit that there is no single definition of a female gamer, and that women gamers are as diverse as any other group of people.\n\nA lack of role models for female gamers contributes to a feeling that they should edit their femininity in order to maintain credibility as a gamer, and that they must fit into the caricatured role of the \"girl gamer\" in order to be accepted. Negative stereotyping of female video game players as \"girl gamers\" quite often comes from male gamers who have themselves been negatively stereotyped by the broader society. Social stigma against games has influenced some women to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly. Parental influence has been theorized to perpetuate some of the stereotypes that female gamers face as boys are bought gifts like Xboxes while girls are bought girl-focused games like \"Barbie\" or educational games.\n\nControversially, some critics have suggested that the term \"gamer\" is endemic to the stereotypical male audience and has become outmoded by the industry's changing demographics.\n\nThere are considerable differences between the video game genres preferred, on average, by women and men. According to a 2017 report by the video game analytics company Quantic Foundry, based on surveys of about 270,000 gamers, the following proportions of gamers within a genre are women or men, respectively:\n\nWhile male audiences prefer fast-paced explosive action and combat, women tend to prefer in-game communication and interpersonal relationships (character development and plot dynamics). Women have also been shown to prefer role-playing video games to first-person shooters, and Thomas W. Malone of Stanford University found that girls preferred to play a Hangman video game over a darts simulation that boys enjoyed.\n\nIn-game activities may also differ between the sexes in games with less linear plots such as the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. Women are often characterized as preferring story-driven games or constructive games like \"The Sims\" or \"Civilization\", but this is not universally true. In 2013, \"Variety\" reported that thirty percent of women were playing more violent games. Of this 30%, 20% played Call of Duty and 15% played Grand Theft Auto. There has been persistent female interest in action-adventure games and MMORPGs like \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Second Life\". Compared to men, female MMORPG players tend to place more emphasis on socialization relative to achievement-oriented play. This emphasis on socialization extends beyond just the game itself: In a study published in the \"Journal of Communication\" in 2009, researchers found that 61% of female MMORPG players played with a romantic partner, compared to 24% of men.\n\nAccording to data collected by Quantic Foundry in 2016, the primary motivations why people play video games differ, on average, by gender. While men frequently want most to compete with others and destroy things, women often want most to complete challenges and immerse themselves in other worlds:\n\nWhile video games and advertising were initially gender-neutral, advertising began to narrow its focus to young boys as a target market following the video game crash of 1983. Although commercial hits such as \"Myst\" and \"The Sims\" appealed to women, these were nonetheless seen by some as being outside the gaming mainstream. Critic Ian Bogost opined, \"We're looking at where there isn't diversity and we're saying those games are the most valid games.\" Industry studies on the lack of women in gaming have also suffered at times from biases of interpretation. Kevin Kelly of Joystiq has suggested that a high degree of circular reasoning is evident when male developers use focus groups and research numbers to determine what kinds of games girls play. After making a bad game that targets those areas suggested by the marketing research, the game's lack of popularity among both genders is often attributed to the incorrect prejudice that \"girls don't play games\" rather than the true underlying problems such as poor quality and playability of the game. Whereas market data and research are important to reveal that markets exist, argues Kelly, they shouldn't be the guiding factor in how to make a game that appeals to girls. The argument has also been advanced that emphasis on market research is often skewed by the participants in the study. In studies on male gamers of the baby boomer generation, for example, players displayed a marked aversion to violence. The incorrect conclusion that could be drawn from this result—that men dislike violent games—may also be comparable to incorrect conclusions drawn from some female-oriented gaming studies. It has been suggested that developers can learn what girls want in a game by observing similarities in how different girl teams will react to and modify a game if given the opportunity.\nIn the past, \"girl games\" have frequently been created by adapting girl-oriented material in other media like \"The Baby-sitters Club\", \"Barbie\", and \"Nancy Drew\" while leaving male-targeted genres such as sport and driving sims, role playing games, and first person shooters to the boys. This has begun to change, however, with the expansion of entrepreneurial feminism and the concept of \"games by girls for girls\" that has been embraced by companies such as Her Interactive, Silicon Sisters and Purple Moon—all video gaming start ups that are female owned and largely female staffed. Creating games designed with regard to sociological, psychological, and cognitive research into girls' cultural interests, such companies hope to awaken a female-only market emphasizing fundamental differences between what girls want and what boys want in gaming. The movement to expand the existing market to include women through the development of gender-neutral games has also had a number of advocates. Critics have proposed that female gamers, especially older female gamers prefer gender-neutral games such as \"Tetris\", \"Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?\", or the \"King's Quest\" games to \"girl games\".\n\nIn examining game play habits at Internet cafés, South Korea has seen a rise in female gamers publicly playing games such as \"Lineage\", while in other Asian countries this kind of public female gaming has remained rare; similarly, games such as \"Tamagotchi\" are seen as a gender neutral in Japan, but have been regarded as girls' games in the West. In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, as in the case of a rising number of female \"Lineage\" players in Korea having led to increased number of female \"Lineage\" players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise of cute culture and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on MMOs and where parents usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).\n\nAn aspect of game design that has been identified as negatively impacting female interest is the degree of expertise with gaming conventions and familiarity with game controls required to play the game. In-game tutorials have been found to bring both sexes into games faster, and new controllers such as Nintendo's Wii Remote, Microsoft's Kinect, and the various rhythm game controllers have affected demographics by making games easier to pick up and by providing a level playing-field. This trend has continued through the efforts of Nintendo in its release of the Wii. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity. In 2012, the developers of Borderlands 2 were criticized for referring to a reduced difficulty option as \"girlfriend mode\". Yet, the perceived skill or performance gap between men and women may be fueled by other factors besides gender. In a 2016 study published in the \"Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,\" researchers found that, after controlling for confounds such as the amount of play time and guild membership, women players advance at least as fast as men do in two MMOs, EverQuest II and .\n\nA 2015 study found that lower-skilled male players of \"Halo 3\" were more hostile towards teammates with a female voice, but behaved more submissively to players with a male voice. Higher-skilled male players, on the other hand, behaved more positively towards female players. The authors argued the male hostility towards female gamers in terms of evolutionary psychology, writing, \"female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status\".\n\nThe top female players in competitive gaming mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, including such games as \"Counter-Strike\", \"Dead or Alive 4\", and \"StarCraft II\". Canadian \"StarCraft II\" player Sasha Hostyn (Scarlett) first gained notoriety in the open qualifiers of IGN ProLeague 4, where she defeated top-tier Korean players. She is well known for being one of the few non-Korean players who can play at the same skill level as male Korean players.\n\nIn 2012, \"Street Fighter x Tekken\" player ArisBakhtanians commented on the lack of female players in the community, saying \"sexual harassment is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community.\" He later apologized for his comments.\n\nIn 2014, organizers for a \"\" tournament in Finland were criticized for limiting registrations to male players only. This was due to the tournament being an offline qualifier for the IeSF World Championship, with its \"Hearthstone\" tournament only open to male players. The winner of the Finnish qualifier would risk not being eligible to participate in the main event if that player were female. The IeSF organization ultimately removed the male-only restriction from all of their tournaments, and in turn the Finnish qualifier that originally sparked the controversy also removed this restriction.\n\nIn December 2015, Kayla \"Squizzy\" Squires became the first female \"Call of Duty\" player to turn professional upon qualifying for the Call of Duty World League in the Australian region.\n\nLeague of Legends player Maria (Sakuya) Creveling, who at the time was known as Remilia or (Remi), finished first in the 2015 Challenger Series Summer Split along with her teammates Renegades which qualified the team for the 2016 North America League Championship Series (NA LCS) Spring Split. She became both the first female and also the first transgender player to compete professionally in the (NA LCS). She joined Renegades as their support player but decided to step down from the team's starting roster three weeks into the 2016 (NA LCS) Spring Split citing anxiety and self-esteem issues as part of her reasoning behind leaving the team.\n\nOn March 17, 2016, the esports organization \"Team Secret\" entered the \"\" competitive scene with female player Julia \"juliano\" Kiran as the in-game leader. They proceeded to win the female tournament at Copenhagen Games 2016.\n\nIn 1989, according to \"Variety\", women constituted only 3% of the gaming industry. In 2013, Gary Carr (the creative director of Lionhead Studios) predicted that within the next 5 to 10 years, the games development workforce would be 50% female. According to Gamasutra's Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 cents for every dollar men made. Game designing woman had the closest equity, making 96 cents for every dollar men made in the same job, while audio professional women had the largest gap, making 68% of what men in the same position made.\n\nThe following table shows the proportion of women among game developers in several countries in 2005 to 2010.\n\nWIGSIG is a special interest group of IDGA (International Game Developers Association). The group was formed in order to foster a positive impact on the game industry regarding gender balance in the workplace and/or marketplace. It provides a community, resources, and opportunities for people in the gaming industry. It also works to assess the numbers of the women in the games industry and tracks the changes of these numbers over time. Additionally, it works to recruit women into the games industry and make the field more attractive to women while providing them with the support and connections they need to be successful.\n\nFounded in 2005, Women in Games International (WIGI), made up of both female and male professionals, works to promote the inclusion and advancement of women in the global games industry.\nWIGI promotes diversity in video game development, publishing, media, education and workplaces, based on a fundamental belief that increased equality and camaraderie among genders can make global impacts for superior products, more consumer enjoyment and a stronger gaming industry.\nWomen In Games International stands as strong advocates for issues crucial to the success of women and men in the games industry, including a better work/life balance, healthy working conditions, increased opportunities for success and resources for career support.\n\nWIGJ is a group that works to recruit, preserve, and provide support for the advancement of women in the games industry by positively and energetically endorsing female role models and providing encouragement and information to women interested in working in the gaming field. The group was incorporated under the UK's Companies Act 2006 on June 2, 2011 as a \"not for profit\" or Community Interest Company. Companies in the game development industry have, in recent years, been seeking to balance the gender ratios on development teams and consoles like the Wii and Nintendo DS have seen increased numbers of female players. In addition to using this growing interest in women in the game developing industry, WIGJ works to put more women in traditional game development with less stigma attached to them. WIGJ seeks to help women find their place within the growing and rewarding field of game development.\n\nThe relationship between women and video game live streaming has been a rocky one. As streaming services such as YouTube and Twitch became increasingly popular, female gamers began to jump on board. Many notable streamers arose from this streaming revolution including Hafu, Glitterlanced, and Sovitia.\n\nGeneviève Forget, a video game streamer, states in a Kotaku interview that \"Harassment does happen in my stream chat from time to time that people start discussing my appearance but it really isn't the focus on my stream. I'd like to think people come back to watch it because it is quite entertaining and I try to interact with the chat as much as possible.\"\n\nFemale streamers are most often criticized for purportedly using services like Twitch as an alternative to soft-core cam websites to solicit donations by performing sexually suggestive acts. Many male gamers, who dominate the industry, correlate female streamers' success to this behavior. Vivyan Andrew, a 29-year-old twitch streamer addresses this in an interview with Kotaku, \"\"Yes, if you're a woman and you're streaming, the misconceptions are that you're seeking attention and/or trying to use your 'assets' to receive donations. The misconceptions are very superficial as they invalidate the streamer as a person and what she has to offer beyond her appearance.\"\n\nTerence Chiang of MMOs.com, writes, \"gaming as a 'male hobby' seems to be integrated into our society, with the computer and technology areas commonly being seen as 'Masculine'.\" This social integration makes the acceptance of female entry into gaming as a legitimate pastime difficult. Research has found that 52% of the gaming world is made up of women, but most remain less visible in the context of the dominant culture, due to the stereotypes between masculinity and gaming.\n\nCritics attribute the seeming lack of female interest in video games to the negative portrayal of women in video games and to misogynistic attitudes common among professional and hardcore gamers. A 2012 Twitter discussion among women working in games, collated under the hashtag \"#1reasonwhy\", argued that sexist practices such as the oversexualization of female characters, disinterest in topics that matter to women, as well as workplace harassment and unequal pay for men and women were common in the games industry.\n\nRegarding elements of game design, areas such as gameplay, mechanics, and similar features have been described as gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player. Gamers of both genders tend to crave realism and the more realistic the gender of the character, the easier it is for a player to identify with the character. A 2009 academic study published in \"New Media & Society\", however, found that 85% of playable characters in video games are male. Erin Hamilton argues that part of the problem comes from the difficulty in \"juxtaposing femininity and feminism in a good video game.\" When female characters do appear in video games, they are often regarded as presenting unhealthy messages concerning unrealistic body images and provocative sexual and violent behaviors for players of both genders. Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) to think that this is how girls are supposed to look and act. Furthermore, over-sexualized depictions of scantily clad female video game characters such as \"Tomb Raider\"'s Lara Croft are not appealing to some girls.\n\nAlthough some of the population of male gamers have been the source of harassment towards female gamers and over-sexualization of the characters, there are many men in the gaming industry who agree that there is a problem with female over-sexualization in gaming. There are also male gamers who argue that some of the sexualization of women in video games also applies to men in video games and that portraying a man or woman in a video game in a sexual way can be acceptable if done in the right context. Perceptions about stereotypes concerning gamers themselves also vary among genders, as well as playing frequency of game genres. A study in the \"Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media\" said that women who play a lot of video games disagree more with stereotypes concerning gender in gaming and are more strongly drawn towards specific gaming genres than men, regardless of the men's gaming frequency.\n\nThe concept that video games are a form of art is one that has begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts recognizing games as a form of art in May 2011, for example. In viewing video games as cultural artifacts and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity to take part in the cultural dialogue that gaming inspires. From an education perspective, certain gaming genres particularly lacking in female players such as the first-person shooter game have been shown to increase spatial skills thereby giving advantages to players of the games that are currently skewed along gender lines. Video games have also been determined to provide an easy lead-in to computer literacy for children and correlations have been drawn between male video gaming and the predominance of male workers within the computer industry. With the increasing importance of tech jobs in the 21st century and the increased role of online networking, the lack of female video game players suggests a loss of future career opportunities for women.\n\nThe majority of the people who work on game development teams are men. Researchers have identified that one of the best ways to increase the percentage of female players comes from the aspect of authorship (either in-game as with \"Neopets\" and \"Whyville\", or indirectly as with the \"Harry Potter\" series' inclusion of Hermione as a playable character subsequent to fan requests). The solution to the problem of societal pigeonholing of female gamers is often identified as interventionist work such as the insertion of women into the industry. Groups like WomenGamers.com and Sony's G.I.R.L. have sought to increase female gamer demographics by giving scholarships to girls considering getting into game development, and game developers like Check Six Games, Her Interactive, Silicon Sisters and Purple Moon have openly courted female coders and developers.\n\nIn addressing the future of the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal should be directed to women in particular. One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include women could be seen in Sega's use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games. Other examples of this include games like \"Mass Effect 3\", \"Remember Me\", and \"the Last of Us\", which include a female option for the main character. The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales. Examination of IGN's Big Games at E3 2012 and Big Games at E3 2013 shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013. Other efforts outside of making games with female characters have also started to occur. One example is that Women in Games International has teamed up with the Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles in order to create a video game patch which the two organizations hope will encourage Girl Scouts to develop an interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. Activism and specifically female-targeted LAN parties in Scandinavia have helped boost female game playing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31595214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31595214", "title": "Yale attitude change approach", "text": "Yale attitude change approach\n\nIn social psychology, the Yale attitude change approach (also known as the Yale attitude change model) is the study of the conditions under which people are most likely to change their attitudes in response to persuasive messages. This approach to persuasive communications was first studied by Carl Hovland and his colleagues at Yale University. The basic model of this approach can be described as \"who said what to whom\": the source of the communication, the nature of the communication and the nature of the audience. According to this approach, many factors affect each component of a persuasive communication. The credibility and attractiveness of the communicator (source), the quality and sincerity of the message (nature of the communication), and the attention, intelligence and age of the audience (nature of the audience) can influence an audience's attitude change with a persuasive communication. Independent variables include the source, message, medium and audience, with the dependent variable the effect (or impact) of the persuasion.\n\nThe Yale attitude change approach has generated research and insight into the nature of persuasion. This approach has helped social psychologists understand the process of persuasion and companies make their marketing and advertising strategies more effective. Like most other theories about persuasion and attitude change, this approach is not perfect. Not a systematic theory about persuasive communications, this approach is a general framework within which research was conducted. The Yale researchers did not specify levels of importance among the factors of a persuasive message; they emphasized analyzing the aspects of attitude change over comparing them.\n\nThe effects of credibility rely on the aspects of the speaker to be of \"high trustworthiness\" or \"low trustworthiness\". Prominent, credible speakers can drastically persuade more people than others who are not credible. Credible speakers also have a sense of reputation where what they say matters to whom they are speaking to. In addition, attractive speakers have a stronger influence than those who are unattractive, regardless if the material is factual or not.\n\nThe characteristics of the nature of the communication impacts the degree of attitude change. One such characteristic is the design of the message; people tend be more persuaded by messages that don't appear to be targeted for them. By nature, there is a primacy effect that occurs with speakers. People are more influenced by what they hear first. The first speaker is recorded stronger than the following speakers even if the arguments following the first speaker are stronger. If there is a delay after every speech, then it is better to go last because of the recency effect where people remember the most recent event the most.\n\nAttitude may change depending on the characteristics of the audience. Audiences that are distracted during the persuasive communication will often be persuaded less than audiences that are not distracted. From the ages of 18-25, people are very susceptible to attitude change. After those ages, people tend to be more stable and resistant to attitude change. Additionally, an audience member that is less intelligent tends to be more persuasable than those with higher intelligence. People who do not enjoy thinking can rely on experts and trustworthy sources to conserve their cognitive resources. If the expert source is untrustworthy, then the person might have to evaluate the material on their own. In most cases, people are not knowledgeable enough to interpret the information themselves or have very low confidence in the issue, thus they must rely on knowledgeable others(expert and trustworthy sources).\n\nThe Yale Attitude Change Approach, also referred to as the Yale Model of Persuasion or Yale School Research is considered to be one of the first models of attitude change. It was a reflection of the Yale Communication Research Program's findings, a program which was set up under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nDuring the early 1900s and World War II there was a heavy need for research on political persuasion as propaganda analysis and public opinion research, the Research Branch of the Army's Information and Education Division was deemed with this responsibility. The importance of understanding methods behind changing public opinion was emphasized by the success of Nazi propaganda campaigns. Carl Hovland was appointed the Chief Psychologist and director of Experimental Studies for the U.S war Department. Along with others such as, Frances J. Anderson, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, John L. Finan, Nathan Maccoby, Fred D. Sheffield, Irving L. Janis, M. Brewster Smit undertook the responsibility of conducting, analyzing, and planning experiments that explored the effectiveness of war propaganda. After the war Hovland, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, and Fred D. Sheffield published a report of the major research findings of the Experimental section of the Research Branch under the publication \"Experiments on Mass Communication, 1949\"\".\" These experiments are considered an antecedent to the Yale groups research. Interest in persuasion remained strong after the war considering the increasing availability and advancements of telecommunications. With interests in persuasion persistent Carl Hovland, Irving Janis, Arthur A. Lumsdaine, Fred D. Sheffield and others within the \"Yale School\" returned to Yale with desires to continue researching the topic. They established the Yale Communication Research Program which aimed to understand and examine factors that influenced attitude change. It was considered the first modern attempt of such a task.  \n\nThe Yale Communication Program was a \"cooperative research and study group\" that encouraged members to pursue research in their line of interest regarding the subject of persuasive communication and their effects on behavior and opinion.  The Yale group examined attitude change from a learning theory perspective and information processing approach. The Yale school's approach is considered \"convergent\". As in it started with identifying a phenomenon (attitude change) and then searched for an explanation by looking at variable factors and their effect on the phenomena, as opposed to a \"divergent approach\" which starts with a theory that is then applied to a phenomenon. The Yale school also suggested that the effects of the factors contributing to attitude change depended on a sequence of message processing stages summarized as; attention, comprehension and acceptance. In essence a person must \"first \"notice\" the message, and \"pay attention\" to it, then \"comprehend\" its meaning, and finally accept it\". They also introduced the concept of \"incentive\" as a crucial variable in influencing attitude change. It was not enough for a response to be learned but that motivation was provided in order to preference one opinion over another.\n\nHovland, Janis, and Kelly published the group's first empirical findings under the publication \"Communication and Persuasion (1953)\"\".\" They paralleled their research to Laswell's (1948) statement; \"who says what to whom with what effect\" \".\" In the publication they categorized their findings on the analysis of four factors: \"1) the communicator who transmits the communication; 2) the stimuli transmitted by the communicator; 3) the audience responding to the communication; 4) the responses made by the audience to the communication\". The Yale School had a breakdown of sub-factors that they observed for each topic (The Communicator, The Communication, The Audience).  The fourth topic, which they deemed \"Responses\" was composed of two subtopics which explored the \"expression of the new opinion\" and \"retention of the opinion change\".  The Yale group had a total of five publications reporting the findings of their experiments (including Communication and Persuasion) under the same model, they were: \"The Order of Presentation in Persuasion, Personality and Persuasibility, Attitude Organization and Change, and Social Judgement\" that further explored each factor.\n\nThe Yale group observed the effects of credibility on persuasion. Credibility was composed of; 1) Expertness: the degree to which the communicator was knowledgeable in the field, and 2) Trustworthines: In reference to the intentions of the communicator.\n\nHovland and Weiss in studies such as, \"The influence of source credibility on communication effectiveness\" (1951), exposed participants to identical newspaper and magazine articles yet attributed them to either high credibility sources (like Robert Oppeinhemier) or low credibility sources (like the Soviet Newspaper Pravda). Their results indicated that participants regarded sources with higher credibility more favorably than those considered as low-credibility. They contributed this effect to the expertise of the source and the confidence in the sources sincerity in delivering the message. They also observed that effects from both positive and negative sources tended to dissipate after several weeks.\n\nAn exception to the gradual dissociation of the effects of a persuasive message were reported in studies conducted by Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Shieffield. Results showed that while memory of factual information decreased or memory of the source dissipated opinion change increased gradually over time, they coined this phenomenon the \"Sleeper Effect\".\n\nThe Yale school focused on factors such as \"Motivating appeals\" and organization of arguments in regards to the content of the communication. In particular they focused on \"\"emotional\" appeals\" which were considered a class of stimuli whose contents could arouse emotion, in contrast to logical/rational appeals. In particular the group looked at fear-arousing appeals.\n\nJanis and Feshbach in their experiment \"Effects of Fear-arousing Communications(1953)\", explored degrees of intensities of fear appeal and their effects on conformity in the context of the consequences of poor dental hygiene. The study showed that messages were more effective when contained low-leveled threat references such as \"cavities\" or \"tooth decay\" instead of \"strong appeal\" references, such as exclaiming serious infections that could cause paralysis and kidney damage. The results suggested that appeals of high intensity would be less effective than milder ones.\n\nIn regards to structure of an argument Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Sheffield explored the effectiveness of one-sided and two-sided messages (containing pros and cons). The study (referenced in \"Experiments on Mass Communications, 1948)\" looked at whether a message given to American soldiers would be more effective if it only advocated one position or if it advocated both sides of the position. It was found that two-sided messages were more effective on budging educated men's opinions. Additionally, two sided arguments were also better at generating change of opinion in those soldiers who opposed the argument initially. For less educated men who also supported the government's position, the one-sided argument was more persuasive. Their findings not only suggested that the content of the communication has an impact on attitude change but so do the attributes of the receiver.\n\nA follow up study conducted by Lumsdaine and Janis, \"Resistance to counter propaganda produced by a one-sided versus\" \"two-side propaganda presentation(1953)\", explored the resistance of opinion change motivated by argument structure. The findings summarized that two sided messages were more effective to resistance of counter propaganda regardless of initial position held (even if the initial belief was counter to the new developed belief). Two sided messages were more effective in maintaining sustained opinion change.\n\nAnother study spearheaded by Hovland and Mandel, \"An experimental comparison of conclusion-drawing by the communicator and by the audience(1952)\", highlighted that messages are more persuasive when they are implicitly argued. The audience is then able to come to their own conclusion. Hovland and Mandel mentioned that this effect may only be evident with less complex issues that can easily be surmised by the audience.\n\nIn terms of the audience the Yale group concerned themselves with the audience predisposition, which they defined as the audience's motives, abilities, personalities, and the context of the situation.\n\nIn one study Kelly and Volkart, \"The resistance to change of group-anchored attitudes (Kelly, Volkart, 1952)\"\",\" confirmed the notion that individuals with greater interest in retaining group membership are less likely to adopt beliefs that contradict group standards. Their findings are consistent with the hypothesis that supports the relationship between internalization of norms and stronger group attachments.\n\nHolland et al. studied the resistance to attitude change when a person is a member of a group and discovered five factors that induce conformity of opinion within a group:\n\n1) the individual's knowledge of group norms\n\n2) the extent to which the individual values group membership\n\n3) the individuals social status or rank within the group\n\n4) particular situation cues\n\n5) salience of the group(the extent to which a specific group is dominant in the individual's awareness at the time the 'counter persuasion' is delivered\n\nBecause these five factors play an influential role in inducing conformity, members may resist attitude change when the group is exposed to a message that counters group norms/culture. The more the group membership is valued, the more resistance, to the extent that a boomerang effect may occur.\n\nThe Yale group did ample and very meaningful research in the field of attitude change and persuasion. They brought forth emphasis on the importance of learning theories behind attitude change and laid a strong foundation of mass findings that stimulated further research related to persuasion. Examples of such work that stemmed from their findings was the \"inoculation theory\" and the \"social judgement theory\". The research was considered a landmark in the development of attitude change and persuasion.\n\nThe Yale attitude change approach is a method of making persuasive communications effective, a study begun by Carl Hovland based on his experiences during World War II attempting to boost morale in US soldiers with propaganda. This study focused on communication-bound predispositions to accept (or reject) appeals and unbound attributes, such as tendencies to particular responses to all communications. The Yale group's research \"stemmed from a variety of theoretical approaches, including, among others, Hull's learning theory, some motivational hypotheses of Freud and other psychoanalysts, and some of the formulations of Lewin, Sherif, Newcomb, and others\". The Yale group developed a theoretical structure linking individual attributes and persuasion based on three major factors: the source of the communication, the nature of the communication and the nature of the audience.\n\nThe approach has a similar structure to Aristotle's concept of persuasion in his \"Rhetoric\". According to Aristotle, there are three means of persuasion: the character of the speaker, the emotional state of the listener and \"logos\" (the argument itself). Contemporary psychologists use the Yale model's psychological approach and Aristotle's philosophical approach to examine components of persuasion.\n\nWilliam McGuire(1968) further broke down Hovland et al. (1953) message processing stages (attention, comprehension, acceptance) into six stages: presentation, attention, comprehension, yielding, retention, and behavior. In summary, McGuire proposed that a message must first be presented, drawn attention to, and then understood and comprehended by the audience. This would cause an attitude change, that must be remembered at a later time to actually influence behavioral changes. McGuire emphasized the importance of reception (the attention and comprehension stages of the Yale group) and yielding (anticipation and critical-evaluation steps) in his study of individual differences in influencibility. According to McGuire reception was positively related to ability and motivational attributes. Individual attributes also contributed to the yielding stage(acceptance of the opinion). One weakness of the approach is the nature of its steps—specifically, the yielding step. The approach assumes that the audience's attitude will change by learning a new message, yet learning does not always result in persuasion. This Information processing paradigm's heritage lays in the message learning theme and theories that guided the work done on persuasion and attitude change by the Yale Communications program. McGuire is best known for his inoculation theory of exploring resistance to persuasion, which was influenced by the Yale School's research on the resilience of two-sided messages on opinion acceptance.\n\nThe Albarracín model, which is a stage model developed in 2002, builds off both McGuire's work and the Yale attitude change approach in regards to the sequence of message processing stages. The study found that message processing may occasionally bypass early stages and takes a step towards addressing the role of processing stages on attitude change. The evidence that people can use processing stages in a different order or even skip a stage altogether was the important acknowledgment of this study. \n\nAnother model that stems from the Yale attitude change approach is the elaboration likelihood model which is a contemporary approach to persuasion. Developed by R.E. Petty and J.T. Cacioppo during the late 1980s, the model describes two ways in which persuasive communications can cause attitude change: centrally and peripherally. The central route to persuasion occurs when people have the ability and motivation to listen to a message, think about its arguments and internalize the information. The recipient relies on cognititive responses instead of heuristics when using the central route. The peripheral route to persuasion is used when the recipient has little to no motivation or effort and people are swayed not by the argument itself but by elements secondary to the message (such as the length of the communication or the attractiveness of the communicator). Under the peripheral route, the recipient relies on the context of the situation rather than the information at hand(i.e. they look at attractiveness in this case or if the person speaking is famous or not).\n\nMartin Bauer views the Yale approach from a slightly-different angle. In 2008, he argued that persuasion cannot focus only on the social influence of intersubjectivity (the sharing of subjective states by two or more individuals) but must include inter-objectivity (the understandings shared by individuals about social reality). Using the concept of the \"fait accompli\" (a completed, irreversible \"done deal\"), Bauer described artifacts such as nuclear power, information technology and genetic engineering as types of social influence.\n\nResearch on external factors which influence individual's attitude has a strong focus on marketing strategy applications. Advances in technology have made mass media pervasive, communications is a $400 billion plus industry. The average American watches 38,000 commercials a year. There is vast financial gains in benefiting from studies examining the factors surrounding source credibility, communicator attractiveness, message context, and mood on persuasion and attitude change.\n\n\"Prepurchase Attribute Verifiability, Source Credibility, and Persuasion\", a study by Shailendra Jain and Steven Posavac, examined the role message origin plays in the likelihood that a recipient will believe the message in an advertisement. Advertisements for mountain bikes and cameras were studied; consumers were asked their overall reaction to search claims (claims which can be statistically proven) and experience claims (testimonials). The credibility of the claims was also compared. Participants were shown advertisements for each of the products and asked questions about the advertisements, which contained search or experience claims. The search claim for the mountain bike was its weight, the experience claim was its ease of control. The search claim for the camera was its compactness and the experience claim was its photo quality. The results indicated that consumers were more likely to believe (and be satisfied with) claims if they thought the source was trustworthy or had experience with the product. They were more likely to believe advertisements with concrete evidence behind the claims, such as the weight of the bike or the compactness of the camera. The study demonstrates that the credibility of a source correlates with its ability to persuade.\n\n\"An Attribution Analysis of Communicator Characteristics on Opinion Change: the Case of Communicator Attractiveness\", a study by Alice Eagly and Shelly Chaiken, examined the effects of attractiveness and message content on persuasion. Eagly and Chaiken surveyed undergraduate students on communicators' attractiveness and whether they were persuaded to adopt the speaker's position (desirable or undesirable) on a topic. Students were asked to predict the speaker's position before hearing the message. The study showed that participants were more likely to be persuaded by an attractive speaker to take an undesirable position on a topic than by an unattractive speaker. However, they were equally likely to be persuaded to take a desirable position on a topic by attractive and unattractive speakers. Participants were more likely to agree with attractive speakers in general and more likely to agree with any speaker discussing a desirable position on a topic. More attractive individuals are more persuasive than individuals perceived as less attractive. Message content affects believability; desirable messages are more believable than undesirable ones.\n\nHovland states another set of factors that impact attitude change, specifically, in order for the communication to be accepted by the recipient. One such factor is the prestige of the medium on which the message is communicated with. One medium may be more prestigeful than others. Most importantly, \"prestige for whom?\" is important to specify since certain mediums may be more prestigeful for certain segments of the population. Accordingly, how the medium differs in credibility affects the prestige of the medium; a medium judged by an individual to be the most trustworthy may be the most effective.\n\nA second factor which may affect the comparison of media is the extent of social interaction. In a study by Knower(1935), hearing a speech when a member of an audience is less effective than hearing it individually. Conversely, a study by Cantril and Allport(1935) suggest that radio may be more effective than print because the individual identifies as part of a larger group of people listening to the same program at the same time.\n\nA third factor that affects the likelihood of acceptance of the message by the recipient is the extent to which the medium provides flexibility. Flexibility in this case means the extent to which the medium can canter to special interests and differences in comprehension. Print, for example, is particularly effective by providing for specialized interests and tastes to a greater extent than other mediums. Additionally, a two-way communication network may also induce flexibility. For example, in a political campaign where a two-way communication between the studio and the listener was employed, flexibility was heightened. Accordingly, \"questions raised by the man-in-the-street could thus be answered immediately by the political candidate in the television studio\"\n\nA major issue with the Yale attitude change approach is the fact that it is strictly functional, focusing on a change in attitude and the information processing accompanying it. Other scholars see persuasion as a function of \"communication, social influence, and group processes\", taking into account other factors such as social influence and the media.\n\nA theory proposed by Margarita Sanchez-Mazas focuses on people's desire for social recognition and dignity. In this model, persuasion is seen as a way to overcome social injustice and achieve recognition and dignity. Sanchez-Mazas examines the roles of majorities and minorities in creating social change, and believes that \"persuasion is a simultaneous, reciprocal process between groups, and specifically between majorities and minorities\".\n\nA persuasion developed by Clelia Nascimento-Schulze emphasizes communication in a complex society. According to Nascimento-Schulze, technology and the media are used to promote science in developing countries. It was determined that the Internet was most successful at transferring scientific knowledge to the public because it contains an optimal amount of visual information and combines art and science in a creative, informative way. Key to this theory is an \"interactive society\" with technology allowing communities to share common values and beliefs, such as the Internet.\n\nAnother form of public persuasion, studied by Helene Joffe, explores how the media produces visual stimuli which elicit feelings of fear, empathy or disgust. This theory highlights the substantial role of technology in evoking emotion in individuals, focusing on advertising campaigns for health, safety and charities. According to Joffe, visual stimuli lure an audience into a \"state of emotion\".\n\nThe Elaboration Likelihood Model is based on the Yale Attitude Approach Model by processing the different outcomes of attitude change. However, there are also claims that they are independent entities that have no connection.\n\nThe model was a major contributor to the development and understanding of attitude change and persuasion, however it is now only one part of many perspectives on persuasion. Research in persuasion is considering the effects of the unconscious, with scholars beginning to explore the possibility of \"priming in inducing non-conscious effects\". This idea, new to social psychology, is beginning to shed light on the relationship between the individual unconscious and the social environment. The study of persuasion has always been an integral part of social psychology with the focus slowly moving from attitude change and behavior modification to communications, literature, art and the other humanities.\n\n"}
