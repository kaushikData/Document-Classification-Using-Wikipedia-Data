At this time the Yemeni highland was contested between several imams, most prominently al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar who lost San'a to the Tahiride Dynasty in July 1462. The Tahirides were a Sunni dynasty based in Zabid and Ta'izz in the lowland. Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad, who had proclaimed his imamate on the death of his father, moved to bring back the important city within the Zaydiyyah fold. In 1464, his officer Muhammad bin Isa Sharib tricked his way into San'a by impersonating the Tahiride governor, who bore the same name. In the next year a Tahiride army made an abortive attempt to retake the city. The troops withdrew after al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad promised to pay tribute. War was resumed later in the same year, but this time the Tahiride prince Amir was killed.\n\nAfter 1465 the imam was left in peace as lord of San'a (Sahib San'a) for 36 years. However, he only controlled part of the highland. The sons of the old imam al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar dominated Kawkaban, and the region around the traditional Zaidi centre Sa'dah was divided between imam al-Mansur Muhammad and two other factions. Al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad was reportedly a good administrator and a man of learning. For a long time he entertained good relations with the Tahiride Sultan Amir. Finally, however, the sultan attacked Dhamar and then San'a in 1501. In spite of the use of mangonels to break the walls, the city held firm. After five months Sultan Amir burnt the equipment that could not be brought along and retreated, defeating a pursuing Zaidi force. Shortly after, in early 1503 (Sha'ban 908 AH), al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad passed way. His old commander Sharib continued to exercise power in San'a and the latter's brother was declared imam as al-Mustansir Ahmad, though he is not counted in the official list of imams. Already in 1504, however, San'a was conquered by the Tahiride sultan.\n\n"}

He belonged to the Qasimid family, that was descended from Muhammad and dominated the Zaidi imamate of Yemen in 1597–1962.\n\nAl-Qasim bin al-Husayn was a grandson of Imam al-Mahdi Ahmad (d. 1681), and the nephew of Imam al-Mahdi Muhammad (d. 1718). During the reign of his uncle, he was a military commander of note, and chastised the Hashid tribes in 1707. For some time he was imprisoned by the ruler. In 1716, however, al-Mahdi Muhammad was badly cornered by the rival imam al-Mansur al-Husayn. He therefore released al-Qasim and sent him to fight the pretender. At Sudah, al-Qasim was defeated by the latter. He subsequently fell out with al-Mahdi Muhammad and submitted to al-Mansur al-Husayn. He proceeded to besiege his uncle on behalf of the pretender imam, and forced him to plead for a truce. However, al-Qasim had no intention to stick to al-Mansur al-Husayn. In the same year 1716 he rose against the usurper and proclaimed himself imam under the name al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim. Since he controlled San'a and the seaports, he was able to block the revenues of al-Mansur al-Husayn, who was ensconced in Shaharah and whose powers were rapidly dwindling. When al-Mansur al-Husayn died in 1720, the Zaidi state was firmly in al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim's hands.\n\nThe reign of al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim was comparatively tranquil. However, in 1723 his cousin an-Nasir Muhammad laid claim (da'wah) to the imamate. The well-known literati Muhammad bin Isma'il al-Amir managed to bring about a reconciliation. In 1726 the imam had an encounter with Arhab tribesmen at San'a. The imam's soldiers, led by al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim in person, defeated them with losses. In the following year the Arhab, together with the Hashid and Bakil tribes, rose again, and tried to enlist the support of the imam's son al-Husayn. Once again, Muhammad bin Isma'il al-Amir had authority enough to bring about a successful mediation.\nAl-Mutawakkil al-Qasim is portrayed in positive terms in the chronicles. Apart from his personal bravery, he was considered a generous character who spent much money from the treasury on the poor. He died in 1727, a few months after the truce with the tribes, and was succeeded by his son al-Mansur al-Husayn II.\n\n"}

The United Kingdom Employment Appeals Tribunal in London (EAT) dismissed the appeal in respect of discrimination and/or harassment, but awarded £1,100 to the plaintiff \"for injury to her feelings\" as a result of the LEA's having failed to follow the statutory grievance protocol.\n\nAishah Azmi, a graduate (in English and Arabic) from Leeds University, was employed as a bi-lingual support worker at Headfield Church of England (Controlled) Junior School, Thornhill Lees, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire (where 92% of the students were Muslim), claimed constructive unfair dismissal for religious discrimination, because the school refused to allow her to wear a niqab that covered her entire face except her eyes as she worked with male colleagues and schoolchildren. The Employment Appeal Tribunal stated the following fact summary.\n\nAfter Azmi requested to be able to wear the veil the school and the local authority allowed her to wear the niqab temporarily outdoors in school grounds, but was concerned that many male colleagues were necessarily in the classrooms. They investigated whether wearing the niqab was compatible with doing her job, but ultimately found in a report \"Gesture and body language including facial expression reinforce the spoken word\" and noted Azmi's \"lovely friend smiling manner with the children and how they responded well to this\" but that children could not respond to her teaching so well when her face was concealed. Accordingly, they concluded that Azmi could not continue working if she kept the niqab. Between November and February Azmi took time off and it was agreed to resolve the issue in the Tribunal.\n\nThe Employment Tribunal dismissed Azmi's claims for direct and indirect religious discrimination and harassment but found that she had been victimised for complaining, and awarded £1000, increased by 10% for the local authority's failure to follow the statutory grievance procedure. Azmi appealed the finding on direct and indirect discrimination and harassment. She was subsequently dismissed by Kirklees Council in February 2006.. She lodged papers with the Employment Appeals Tribunal in London, although she was publicly advised by her MP Shahid Malik to drop the case, since 'there is no real support for it'. Azmi's legal representative, Nick Whittingham, of Kirklees Law Centre, represented her during her unsuccessful appeal, heard in 2007.\n\nWilkie J in the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that there was no direct or indirect discrimination or harassment.

COBIT provides an implementable \"set of controls over information technology and organizes them around a logical framework of IT-related processes and enablers.\"\n\nISACA first released COBIT in 1996, originally as a set of control objectives to help the financial audit community better maneuver in IT-related environments. Seeing value in expanding the framework beyond just the auditing realm, ISACA released a broader version 2 in 1998 and expanded it even further by adding management guidelines in 2000's version 3. The development of both the AS 8015: \"Australian Standard for Corporate Governance of Information and Communication Technology\" in January 2005 and the more international draft standard ISO/IEC DIS 29382 (which soon after became ISO/IEC 38500) in January 2007 increased awareness of the need for more information and communication technology (ICT) governance components. ISACA inevitably added related components/frameworks with versions 4 and 4.1 in 2005 and 2007 respectively, \"addressing the IT-related business processes and responsibilities in value creation (Val IT) and risk management (Risk IT).\"\n\nIn April 2012, COBIT 5 was released. Several drivers were responsible for the transition from 4.1 to 5:\n\n\nAn add-on for COBIT 5 related to information security was released in December 2012, and one related to assurance was released in June 2013.\n\nIn November and December of 2018, the next version of COBIT, COBIT 2019, was released.\n\nCOBIT was initially \"Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies,\" though before the release of the framework people talked of \"CobiT\" as \"Control Objectives for IT\" or \"Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology.\" The framework defines a set of generic processes for the management of IT, with each process defined together with process inputs and outputs, key process-activities, process objectives, performance measures and an elementary maturity model. COBIT also provides a set of recommended best practices for governance and control process of information systems and technology with the essence of aligning IT with business. COBIT 5 consolidates COBIT 4.1, Val IT and Risk IT into a single framework acting as an enterprise framework aligned and interoperable with other frameworks and standards.\n\nThe business orientation of COBIT consists of linking business goals to IT goals, providing metrics and maturity models to measure their achievement, and identifying the associated responsibilities of business and IT process owners.\n\nThe process focus of COBIT is illustrated by a process model that subdivides IT into four domains (Plan and Organize; Acquire and Implement; Deliver and Support; and Monitor and Evaluate) and 34 processes inline with the responsibility areas of plan, build, run, and monitor. It is positioned at a high level and has been aligned and harmonized with other, more detailed IT standards and good practices such as COSO, ITIL, BiSL, ISO 27000, CMMI, TOGAF and PMBOK. COBIT acts as an integrator of these different guidance materials, summarizing key objectives under one umbrella framework that link the good practice models with governance and business requirements. COBIT 5 further consolidated and integrated the COBIT 4.1, Val IT 2.0 and Risk IT frameworks and drew from ISACA's \"IT Assurance Framework\" (ITAF) and the \"Business Model for Information Security\" (BMIS).\n\nThe framework and its components can, when utilized well, also contribute to ensuring regulatory compliance. It can encourage less wasteful information management, improve retention schedules, increase business agility, and lower costs while better complying with data retention and management regulations.\n\nCOBIT components include:\n\n\n"}

In the early 2000s their numbers were estimated at around 6,000, or a little over half of one percent of Fiji's population. The most recent estimation puts the population at 8,000 making the concentration of Chinese in Fiji at around one percent. Around 80% of Chinese in Fiji speak Cantonese and around 16% speak Shanghainese as their native language. Chinese in Fiji also speak the local Fijian language. Chinese in Fiji have a strong Buddhist background and some retained Confucian traditions. There are also a considerable number of Fijians who are of partial Chinese extraction, being descended from marriages between Chinese and indigenous Fijians.\n\nFor electoral purposes, Chinese people used to be counted as General Electors, an omnibus category for Fijian citizens not of indigenous, Indian, or Rotuman descent, who were allocated three seats in the 71-member House of Representatives. This classification became redundant with the 2013 Constitution, which abolished ethnic representation in Parliament.\n\nThe history of Chinese people in Fiji dates to the year 1855, when Moy Ba Ling, also known as \"Houng Lee,\" reached Fiji in a sail boat from Australia and settled in Levuka. He later returned to China, before bringing his relatives and some others to settle in Fiji, in connection with the gold rush. Later arrivals came looking for sandalwood and beche-de-mer. According to Dixon Seeto, President of the Chinese Association of Fiji in the early 2000s, the first shops in rural areas of Fiji were opened by Chinese merchants.\n\nChinese people were enfranchised for the first time in 1964. The former \"European\" roll was redefined to include other minority groups and renamed the \"General Electors\" roll. Despite being only a splinter of the electorate, General Electors were then allocated 10 of the 36 seats in the Legislative Council, as the legislature was then known, though this figure has gradually been reduced since independence in 1970.\n\nAround a thousand Chinese settled in Fiji in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and in February 1995, the Fijian Cabinet approved a plan to allow up to 7000 Hong Kong Chinese to immigrate to Fiji. Conditions included payment of F$30,000 to the government, and investment of F$100,000 in government-approved projects. Many of these invested in restaurants, retailing, and market gardening (mostly in Kalabu, Tamavua, Delaivalelevu, Vikoba, Sawani and Waibau), and have intensified horticulture around Suva. A further wave of Chinese has arrived since the late 1990s, many of them from the northern part of China. Many of the more recent immigrants have opened bakeries and other food outlets in Fijian villages, creating employment for local people, says Fiji Times editor Samisoni Kakaivalu.\n\nThe exact date of Moy Ba Ling's arrival is not known, but on 17 September 2005, the Chinese community celebrated the 150th anniversary.\n\nA 357-kilogram heroin bust in 2000 and a Suva drug laboratory, with a value estimated at close to F$1 billion, in 2004, raised public concerns about the activities of some of the more recent Chinese immigrants. The activities of a few of them, says Fiji Law Society President Graeme Leung, have unfairly stigmatized the Chinese community in the eyes of the public.\n\nOn 4 October 2005, Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Orisi Rabukawaqa said that the Army had uncovered an immigration scam. Almost seven thousand Chinese nationals, he claimed, had entered Fiji illegally since 2003. He alleged that bribery in the office of the Registrar General had resulted in massive falsification of documents, with Chinese immigrants being falsely identified as ethnic Fijians. Military investigations showed that illegal immigration was related to increasing rates of prostitution, gambling, money laundering, and illegal fishing.\n\nOn 6 October, Justice Ministry Chief Executive Sakiusa Rabuka challenged the Military to substantiate its allegations, telling the Fiji Village news service on 9 October that the allegations made by the Military were \"baseless.\" Only one case had been found, he said, of an Asian national trying to change his birth certificate.\n\nAs more evidence came to light, however, the local Chinese community called for a crackdown on corruption in the immigration service. Government-appointed Senator Kenneth Low, who was also President of the Chinese Business Association in Fiji, alleged on 8 November that corrupt immigration officials were granting Fijian citizenship to illegal Asian immigrants for money and sex, and called on the government to establish a commission of inquiry into illegal immigration.\n\nDixon Seeto spoke out on 15 December against violent attacks made against Chinese market gardeners and farmers. Both men and women were being assaulted by youths seeking cash, he claimed, when bringing their produce to the market at around 3 or 4 a.m. He called for more police patrols to prevent such attacks.\n\nChinese Fijian have been increasingly linked to illegal human smuggling activities for prostitution since 2006. Several night club owners who are Fijians of Chinese origin such the Wei Zhang and his wife Liu Da Jun (East Court Reastaurant), Billy Chen and Lum Moon Woot (Angel Night Club) and Yan Xiu Hua (Signals Night Club) have been accused of involvement in allowing mainland Chinese prostitutes to solicit for businesses within their premises from mainland Chinese fishing crews.\n\nWell-known persons of whole or partial Chinese descent include former Cabinet Minister Pio Wong, former Senators Kenneth Low and James Ah Koy, Peter Lee (former long serving General Manager of Coca-Cola Fiji and currently heading Fiji's largest conglomerate - \"Carpenters\") and prominent lawyer Graeme Leung. At the 150th anniversary celebrations, Fiji's Vice-President, Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, paid tribute to the contribution the Chinese community has made to Fiji. \"The Chinese community has never been a large one but their influence has been felt far beyond their numbers,\" he said.\n\n"}

Statistics for that year also showed 1,273 Chinese expatriates holding employee permits, 11.3% of the total number. This represented 36% growth over the previous year's number of 937. Many of the self-employed work as traders in the Oriental Plaza in Gaborone. There is also an increasing number of Chinese traders in Francistown, an influx noted by locals as early as 2005. In local slang, poor-quality Chinese goods are referred to as \"Fong-kongs\". Some locals accuse Chinese businesspeople of violating local labour laws by forcing employees to work long hours, while others praise them for the low prices they offer.\n\nIn July 2008, new trade laws repealed the earlier Specialised Dealer licence system under which had been primarily used by Chinese and other foreigners. It was speculated that this could lead to self-employed Chinese traders being forced to leave the country; the Gaborone City Council indicated that it would be willing to license the Chinese under the \"Miscellaneous Trade\" category for an adjustment period of two years. The Chinese ambassador also speculated that local traders might eventually be able to out-compete the Chinese. In early 2009, Chinese were also banned from dealing in clothes; local traders had complained that the Chinese were using the Specialised Dealer system to engage in general retail sales. New trade laws reserved 13 types of retail businesses for locals only: general clothing shops, general dealers, car washes, auctioneers, fresh produce shops, funeral parlours, hairdressers, laundromats, petrol filling station, take-away restaurants, cleaning services, and curio shops.\n\nLawmakers have also expressed concern about the rising number of unskilled Chinese labourers coming to Botswana to work in jobs such as ditch-digging, even in deep rural areas. According to government records in 2006, there were 1,094 Chinese citizens legally registered to work in the construction industry in Botswana, slightly more than a third of the total number of legal Chinese residents at the time. A number of construction projects managed by Chinese companies, such as the Sir Seretse Khama International Airport expansion project, primary schools in Serowe, Oriental Plaza, and Dikgathong Dam, illegally employed Chinese workers whose had no work permits or whose permits had not yet been approved. However, in response to these accusations, the Chinese embassy claimed that the work permit process was already very cumbersome and that it was difficult to find locals willing to work on construction projects.\n\n\"The Oriental Post\" (华侨周报), a Chinese-language weekly newspaper, was launched in May 2009. It is believed to be the first newspaper of Botswana to be printed in an international language other than English. Its president is Miles Nan (南庚戌), who also runs a construction company in Botswana. Its editor-in-chief is Tian Wentai (田文泰).\n\nThe Botswana Chinese General Chamber of Commerce (博茨瓦纳华人华侨总商会) was established in 1998. As late as 2007 it was the only non-profit Chinese organisation in the country. It organises a variety of activities including ping pong tournaments and celebrations of Chinese holidays such as the Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival. They have also cooperated with the Botswana authorities to translate local laws into Chinese for the benefit of those who do not speak English.\n\nIn 2009, a number of other Chinese organisations were founded. One was the Botswana-China Friendship Association (博茨瓦纳-中国友好协会), in which Miles Nan was also tapped to be the executive chairman, and Botswana's former ambassador in Beijing was chosen as an honorary chairman. Another was the Botswana Huaren Golf Association (博茨瓦纳华人高尔夫球协会), which organised its inaugural tournament among locals as well as Chinese, Kenyan, Korean, South African, and Zimbabwean expatriates in July 2009.\n\n\n"}

Messerschmitt and Szyperski have studied what factors affect the perceived consumer surplus in the software product market. The value a customer places on software is affected by things such as compatibility with complementary products, degree of adoption in the market, usability, increases in productivity, differentiation from competitors, and innovativeness. These can be customer satisfaction dimensions. \n\nOn the other hand, many things affect the total cost of ownership of software products besides price. These include implementation, training, management, and operations costs. Additionally, switching costs to competitors play a role because customers may fear that the vendor may discontinue the product or go out of business.

Both are usually known simply as \"Ecatepec\". The city is practically co-extensive with the municipality, with the city's 2005 population of 1,687,549 being 99.9% of the total municipal population of 1,688,258. The provisional population at the 2010 Census was 1,658,806. The city forms the most populous suburb of Mexico City (Ciudad de México) and the fifteenth suburb in the world in population. It is also Mexico's most populous municipality after Iztapalapa, Mexico City.\n\nThe name \"Ecatepec\" is derived from Nahuatl, and means \"windy hill\" or \"hill devoted to Ehecatl.\" It was also an alternative name or invocation to Quetzalcoatl. \"Morelos\" is the last name of José María Morelos, a hero of the Mexican War of Independence.\n\nMost inhabitants commute to Mexico City for work, and the Mexico City metro subway system was extended into Ecatepec.\n\n\"San Cristóbal\" (Saint Christopher) is the city's patron saint. His feast day is celebrated on July 25 each year.\n\nPoints of interest include the newest Catholic Cathedral in Mexico, \"Sagrado Corazón de Jesús\", several colonial era churches and the colonel edifice Casa de los virreyes.\n\nThe location of the municipality is north of the Mexico City, and is located in the low extreme geographical coordinates of Greenwich, north latitude 19º29'23\" minimum, 19º40'28\" maximum, west longitude 98°58'30\" minimum, 99°08'35\" maximum.\n\nThe town of San Cristóbal Ecatepec, a municipal seat, has governing jurisdiction over the following communities: San Pedro Xoloxtoc, Tulpetlac, Chiconautla, Ciudad Azteca and Villa de Aragón. The total municipality extends 157.34 km and borders with the municipalities of Tlalnepantla de Baz, Tecámac, Coacalco de Berriozábal, Jaltenco, Acolman, Texcoco, Atenco, Nezahualcóyotl and Mexico City (Gustavo A. Madero). The area of this municipality is 155 km² (59.85 sq mi).\n\nThe human senttlements in Ecatepec de Morelos are an elongated valley from the Valley of Mexico to Sierra de Guadalupe. \n\n75% of Ecatepec de Morelos municipality is urbanized, on this territory there are no big animals; in the highlands of Sierra de Guadalupe live principally small mammals such as mouse, rabbit, gray squirrel, bat and gopher, birds, such as cenzontle and sparrow. The flora in Sierra de Guadalupe is represented by oyamel pines, oaks, ocote pines, century plants, prickly pears, zacatón (mountain grass) and other.\n\nRemains of earliest human inhabitation of the area have been found on the nearby \"Cerro\" (Hill) \"de Ecatepec\". The area was initially settled by successive waves of Otomis; however, because of the later arrival of Toltec-Chichimecas that dominated the rest of the Valley of Mexico, this area eventually assimilated to the rest of the Valley, ending with its domination by the Aztec empire. Ecatepec was an Aztec \"altepetl\" or city-state in the Valley of Mexico. From 1428 to 1539, Ecatepec was ruled by a \"tlatoani\" (literally \"speaker\"). The \"tlatoque\" (plural of \"tlatoani\") of Ecatepec were closely related to the ruling dynasty of Tenochtitlan.\n- Chimalpilli I, grandson of Moctezuma I.\n- Tezozomoc, son of Chimalpopoca.\n- Matlaccohuatl, whose daughter Teotlalco married Moctezuma II.\n- Chimalpilli II, son of Ahuitzotl.\n- Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin, grandson of Axayacatl.\n\nDiego Huanitzin was subsequently made tlatoani of Tenochtitlan by Antonio de Mendoza, viceroy of New Spain.\n\nDuring the Aztec empire, the Mexicas used the town to control trade routes going north.\n\nEcatepec was considered an \"República de Indios\" (Indian Republic) 1560, allowing the village to maintain a certain amount of autonomy and keeping the succession of tlatoanis or chiefs. However, in the first part of the 17th century, this was changed to a mayorship, with the Spanish administrating, along with the communities of Zumpango and Xalostoc.\n\nThe municipality was officially created on October 13, 1874. On October 1, 1877, San Cristóbal Ecatepec was declared a village and \"de Morelos\" was added to its name.\n\nThe national hero José María Morelos y Pavón was executed in Ecatepec in 1815 by the Spanish during the Mexican War of Independence. The house in which he was executed is now the Museo Casa de Morelos (Museum House of Morelos). Ecatepec was declared a city on December 1, 1980.\n\nIn April 1995, the remains of a mammoth were found in Colonia Ejidos de San Cristóbal, where the ancient lakes of Xaltocan-Ecatepec and Texcoco came together and where the Aztecs build a dam to keep the fresh and salty waters separate. The bones have been tentatively dated to around 10,500 years B.C.\n\nEcatepec de Morelos had a 2010 census population of 1,656,107 inhabitants, which makes it the most populous municipality in the nation , as well as in the state.\n\nIn February 2016, Pope Francis celebrated Mass in the city in front of a crowd of 300,000. The Pope's message was one of encouragement and opposition to the violence and drug trade that permeates the region.\n\nAlmost all of the population (99.934%) lives in its one urban locality, Ecatepec de Morelos, the most populous locality (city) in Mexico except for the Iztapalapa Borough of Mexico City. There are also six rural localities (cities, towns, and villages) in the municipality, half of which reported no population in the 2010 census:\nJumex has its headquarters in the city.\n\nPlaza Las Américas shopping mall is located in Ecatepec, in which are located Liverpool, Sears and Suburbia department stores as well as a WalMart.\n\nEcatepec is served by Line B of the Mexico City Metro system, including stations Muzquiz, Ecatepec (a.k.a. Tecnológico), Olímpica, Plaza Aragón, and Ciudad Azteca\n\nIn 2016, a new transportation system was introduced to Ecatepec's inhabitants: Mexicable. This project is a cable car which main purpose is to help people displace faster (contrary to most cable cars which have tourists as their main users), specially in areas with complicated geography. The idea was originally developed in the South Americas, with Colombia being the first country to add a cable car system, called Metrocable, as part of their metro. The Mexicable, the first cable car constructed in Mexico as a public transport, has a length of almost 5 kilometres (3 miles), 190 cars and it runs the entire line in about 17 minutes.\n\nEcatepec is located on Fed 85, the Mexico City-Pachuca highway, Fed 57/Fed 57D (Circuito Exterior Mexiquense), and Fed 132 (Ecatepec-Teotihuacán highway).\n\n"}

{"id": "176251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176251", "title": "Gender marking in job titles", "text": "Gender marking in job titles\n\nOne of the chief issues with which the movement for gender-neutral language has been concerned is that of gender (sex) specificity in job titles.\n\nA gender-specific job title is a name of a job that also specifies or implies the gender of the person performing that job. For example, in English, the job title \"stewardess\" implies that the person is female; the job title \"policeman\" implies that the person is male. A gender-neutral job title, on the other hand, is one that does not specify or imply gender, such as \"firefighter\" or \"lawyer\". In some cases it may be debatable whether a title is gender-specific; for example, \"chairman\" appears to denote a male (because of the ending \"-man\"), but the title is also applied sometimes to women.\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the use of gender-neutral job titles, particularly in contexts where the gender of the person in question is not known or not specified. For example, they prefer \"flight attendant\" to \"stewardess\" or \"steward\", and \"police officer\" to \"policeman\" or \"policewoman\". In some cases this may involve deprecating the use of certain specifically female titles (such as \"authoress\"), thus encouraging the use of the corresponding unmarked form (such as \"author\") as a fully gender-neutral title.\n\nThe above applies to gender neutrality in English and in some other languages without grammatical gender (where grammatical gender is a feature of a language's grammar that requires every noun to be placed in one of several classes, often including feminine and masculine). In languages with grammatical gender, the situation is altered by the fact that nouns for people are often constrained to be inherently masculine or feminine, and the production of truly gender-neutral titles may not be possible. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language may instead focus on ensuring that feminine and masculine words exist for every job, and that they are treated with equal status.\n\nThe suffix \"-man\" had the meaning \"person\" in Old English (see \"man\"), but in present-day English it is predominantly masculine. Thus job titles that include this suffix, such as \"fireman\", \"salesman\" and \"alderman\", generally imply that the holder is male. While some of these job titles have feminine variants (e.g. \"alderwoman\"), others do not, because traditionally the positions in question were not occupied by women. For most such titles, gender-neutral equivalents now also exist, such as \"police officer\" (for \"policeman\" or \"policewoman\"), \"salesperson\" or \"sales representative\" (for \"salesman\" or \"saleswoman\"), etc. However, some proposed gender-neutral terms have not attained such common usage (as with \"fisher\" as an alternative to \"fisherman\"). Military ranks with the suffix \"-man\" normally remain unchanged when applied to females: for example, a woman serving in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers might be known as Craftsman Atkins.\n\nIn the case of \"chairman\", gender-neutral alternatives (such as \"chair\" and \"chairperson\") exist, although in some contexts the word \"chairman\" is used even where it denotes (or could denote) a woman. For details, see \"Chairman\".\n\nFeminine terms such as \"actress\", \"usherette\" and \"comedienne\" are marked with respect to the masculine (\"actor\", \"usher\", \"comedian\") both formally (i.e. something is added to the masculine form) and in the sense that only the masculine form can be used generically to describe a mixed-gender group of people. This means that the \"masculine\" form can in fact serve as a gender-neutral term (a solution often favored by proponents of gender-neutral language, who thus tend to deprecate or restrict usage of the specifically feminine forms). Some such feminine forms, such as \"poetess\" and \"authoress\", are now rarely used. Others, such as \"actress\", remain common, although increasing numbers of women are calling themselves \"actors\" rather than \"actresses\", especially in the live theatre. The Screen Actors Guild annually gives out awards for \"Best Male Actor\" and \"Best Female Actor\".\n\nThe term \"waiter\" appears to retain masculine specificity (with \"waitress\" as the corresponding feminine term). Other gender-neutral terms have therefore been proposed, such as \"server\" (alternatives include \"waitron\", \"waitstaff\" or \"waitperson\"), though these are rarely used outside North America.\n\nThe term \"midwife\" looks superficially to be feminine (since it ends with \"-wife\"), but it is used for either gender. The term comes from an Old English term meaning \"with the woman\".\n\nA change to gender-neutral job titles can be controversial. This debate reflects the debate over gender-neutral language in general.\n\nThe case for switching to gender-neutral job titles usually makes an ideological argument, that gender-specific job titles at some level promote sexism in the workplace. For example, fire chiefs have argued that when the public uses the term \"fireman\" instead of \"firefighter\", it reinforces the popular image that firefighting is only a job for men, and thus makes it difficult for them to recruit women. \n\nThe case for the more traditional, gender-specific terms is usually a practical argument, that replacing the historical terms everywhere they appear (in documents, etc.) would be difficult and expensive, or that it is unnecessary. However, there are many (in particular feminists) who would claim that this argument is really a backlash against the argument for gender-neutral language.\n\nThere is much difficulty in resolving this debate, as in the case of gender-neutral language in general; however there is at least one difference. Whereas in the general case, there is often no appropriate singular gender-neutral replacement (e.g. the third person singular pronoun \"he\", although the use of singular they is increasingly common), there are gender-neutral versions of nearly all job titles.\n\nDuring the 19th century, attempts to overlay Latin grammar rules onto English required the use of feminine endings in nouns ending with -or. This produced words like \"doctress\" and \"professoress\" and even \"lawyeress\", all of which have fallen out of use; though \"waitress\", \"stewardess\", and \"actress\" are in modern use.\n\nUse of the term \"chairman\" remains widespread in predominantly male sectors of society, but \"chairperson\" or \"chair\" is now widespread in society in general, at least in the USA, Canada and increasingly in the U.K. For example, the boards of most Fortune 500 companies in the United States are presided over by a \"chairman\" and also the overwhelming majority of the (FTSE 100) companies in the United Kingdom have a \"chairman\", while committees in the United States House of Representatives are presided over by a \"chair\", as of 2009. Since most of these are, however, men, a more correct description of the current language situation needs to consider use in organisations whose chairperson is a woman. Less than half of the members of the American Heritage Dictionary's usage panel accept the use of the word \"chairman\" in describing a woman.\n\nSome usage guides, such as \"The Cambridge Guide to English Usage\", advocate gender-neutral language in circumstances where all sexes are meant to be included. For instance, a business might advertise that it is looking for a new \"chair\" or \"chairperson\" rather than \"chairman\". Gender-neutral language proscribes \"chairman\", on the grounds that some readers would assume women and those of other genders are implicitly excluded from responding to an advertisement using this word.\n\nProponents of gender-neutral job titles believe that such titles should be used, especially when referring to hypothetical persons. For example, \"firefighter\" instead of \"fireman\"; \"mail carrier\", \"letter carrier\", or \"post worker\" rather than \"mailman\"; \"flight attendant\" instead of \"steward\" or \"stewardess\"; \"bartender\" instead of \"barman\" or \"barmaid\". In the rare case where no useful gender-neutral alternative is available, they believe both male and female terms should be used.\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language advocate the use of a neuter form when/where appropriate. For example, a company may seek to fill a vacancy and hire a new \"chairperson\". Since a gendered individual doesn't currently hold the position, its title reverts to a neuter form. Once that position is filled, many advocates believe gender can be attached to the title as appropriate (chair\"man\" or chair\"woman\").\n\nSometimes this formulation can lead to inconsistent gender-specific usage, in which women become \"chairpersons\" but men remain \"chairmen\". Some women opt to use the word \"chairman\" in preference to \"chairwoman\", subject to the style \"Madam\" or \"Mister\" prefixing the title, which they perceive to be gender-neutral by itself. Particularly in academia, the word Chair is often used to designate the person chosen to oversee the agenda at meetings of an organized group.\n\nThe principle of gender-neutral language dictates that job titles that add suffixes to make them feminine should be avoided. For example, \"usher\", not \"usherette\"; \"comedian\", not \"comedienne\". Some of these are almost entirely obsolete now, such as sculptress, poetess, and aviatrix. If gender is relevant, the words \"woman\" or \"female\" should be used instead of \"lady\" (\"my grandmother was the first female doctor in the province\"), except if the masculine is \"lord\" (as in \"landlady\"). In the case of landlord or landlady, it may be preferable to find an equivalent title with the same meaning, such as proprietor or lessor. However, when a female is in the office of \"the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,\" it is changed to \"the Usher of the Black Rod\" in Canada.\n\nAdvisors on non-sexist usage deprecate terms such as \"male nurse,\" \"male model,\" or \"female judge\" because such terms are often used when the gender is irrelevant. These advisors say that the statement of exception indicates that a worker of that gender is somehow an inferior or atypical member of that profession.\n\nWhen words have a grammatical gender associated with them, in many languages, they may impose morphological requirements to maintain sentence agreement. That is, there is a non-political content to the word changes, or inflection. Nevertheless, gender-identification word endings are sometimes dropped, something that happened often in the former East Germany, for example. Sometimes an entirely new or etymologically unrelated word is coined. For example, when men in France wanted to become midwives, up till then an exclusively female occupation, they chose not to adapt the existing term \"sage-femme\" (\"wise woman\"), and instead coined \"maïeuticien\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "174774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174774", "title": "Germans from Russia", "text": "Germans from Russia\n\nGermans from Russia (German: \"Deutsche aus Russland\" or \"Russlanddeutsche\"; Russian: \"Российские немцы\", \"rossiyskiye nemtsy\") refers to the large numbers of ethnic Germans who emigrated from the Russian Empire, peaking in the late 19th century. The upper Great Plains in the United States and southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan have large areas populated primarily by descendants of Germans from Russia. Argentina, Brazil and other countries have smaller numbers of Germans from Russia.\n\nTheir mother tongues were High German or Low German dialects, despite their having lived in Russia for multiple generations. The Germans in Russia frequently lived in ethnic German communities, where they maintained German-language schools and German churches. They were primarily Volga Germans from the lower Volga River valley, Black Sea Germans from the Crimean Peninsula/Black Sea region, or Volhynian Germans from the governorate of Volhynia in contemporary Ukraine. The smaller villages were often settled by colonists of a common religion, who had come from the same area, so one town might be all Catholic, or all Lutheran, for instance; the people often settled together from the same region of Germany and thus spoke the same German dialect. Also included were Germans of the Mennonite faiths (today mostly referred to as Russian Mennonite despite of their German language culture and ethnicity), and also Hutterites seeking religious freedom.\n\nOriginally recruited and welcomed into Russia in the 18th century, when they were promised the practice of their own language and religions, and exemption from military service, the German people found increasing hardship. With changes in Russian politics, the government took back some of the privileges granted; economic conditions grew poor, and there were a series of famines. These conditions led to German mass migrations from Russia.\n\nAfter the 1917 Revolution and the rise of the Soviet Union, and particularly under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, conditions for the remaining Germans in Russia declined considerably. The rise of Nazi Germany, with its concern about ethnic Germans in other lands and proselytizing the German \"volk\", led to suspicions of any German within Russia. In 1932-33, the Soviet authorities forced starvation among the Volga Germans, seized their food claiming famine in the rest of the Soviet Union and ordering the breakup of many German villages.\n\nAfter the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Stalin ordered the deportation of Russian Germans to labor camps in Siberia and Central Asia, as he was suspicious of potential collaboration with the Germans. In some areas, his forces attempted to bulldoze the German churches, and reused their tombstones for paving blocks. Many Germans in the Americas sent donations back to their communities, but others permanently lost contact with their relatives during the social disruption of the famine and Stalin's Great Purge, followed by World War II.\n\nUnlike many other immigrants to the Americas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Germans from Russia wanted to continue farming and settled in agricultural areas rather than industrial cities. Primary areas were the Plains states of Illinois, Nebraska, Kansas, North and South Dakota, with some movement to specific areas of Washington and California (Fresno and Lodi for instance) in the United States; Saskatchewan and Manitoba of Canada; and Brazil and Argentina. These areas tended to resemble the flat plains of the Russian steppes. In addition, the upper Great Plains still had arable land available for free settlement under the Homestead Act. In the 2000 Census, North Dakota reported 43.9% of the population identified as having German ancestry. In 1910, 5% of the population of North Dakota had been born in Russia; it is likely most were ethnic Germans.\n\nLarge-scale immigration to the Americas started in the 1870s and continued until the 1917 Revolution, when travel and emigration were stopped.\n\nSince the reunification of Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and declining conditions in Russia, many ethnic Germans still living in the lands of the former Soviet Union sought German repatriation.\n\nGermans from Russia were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals. About 100,000 Volga Germans immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota was known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.\n\nThe largest groups settled mainly in the Great Plains: North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas and nearby areas in the US. Outside that area, they also settled in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Fresno County in California's Central Valley. They often succeeded in dryland farming, which they had practiced in Russia. Many of the immigrants who arrived between 1870 and 1912 spent a period doing farm labor, especially in northeastern Colorado and in Montana along the lower Yellowstone River in sugar beet fields.\n\nOther Volga Germans made new lives in the industrializing American cities, especially Chicago, which had an immense upsurge in immigration from Eastern Europe during this time. Today Chicago has the largest number of ethnic Volga Germans in North America. The largest area of concentrated settlement was in Jefferson Park on the city's Northwest Side, mostly between the years 1907-1920. By 1930, 450 families of the Evangelical faith were living in this area, most of whom originated from \"Wiesenseite\". Later during the period of suburbanization, many of their descendants moved out to outlying areas such as Maywood and Melrose Park. A number of families living in the Jefferson Park central business district along Lawrence and Milwaukee Avenue have Volga German immigrant ancestors.\nBernhard Warkentin was born in a small Russian village in 1847, and travelled to America in his early twenties. Interested in flour mills, he was especially impressed with the wheat-growing possibilities in the United States. After visiting Kansas, Warkentin found the Great Plains much like those he had left behind. Settling in Harvey County, he built a water mill on the banks of the Little Arkansas River – the Halstead Milling and Elevator Company. Warkentin's greatest contribution to Kansas was the introduction of hard Turkey Wheat into Kansas, which replaced the soft variety grown exclusively in the state.\n\nNegatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the Tsar, the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern Midwest saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had immigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities that retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and created choir groups that sang German church hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets—still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War I their identity was challenged by anti-German sentiment. \n\nBy the end of the World War II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia sometimes use loanwords, such as \"Kuchen\" for cake, although the word is primarily used for the sweet bread dessert made in a pie plate with topping like fruits or cottage cheese. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct and has left a lasting impression on the American West.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Dr. Kenneth Rock, a professor of history at Colorado State University, collected sixty oral histories of German Russian immigrants and their descendants as part of the \"Germans from Russia in Colorado\" Study Project. It documented life in the ethnic German communities in Russia, the immigration experience, work and social life in the United States, and interaction between the German-Russian communities and the wider society in both Russia and the United States.\n\nApproximately one million descendants of Germans from Russia live in the United States. Modern descendants in Canada and the United States refer to their heritage as \"Germans from Russia\", \"Russian Germans\", \"Volgadeutsch\" or \"Black Sea Germans.\" In many parts of the United States, they tend to have blended to a large degree with the \"regular\" German Americans who are much more numerous in the northern half of the United States.\n\nIn addition to the large population of Volga Germans that settled on the American prairie, many also settled in the Canadian West. Beginning in the early 1870s, the Canadian Government had created promotional programs in Europe to entice settlers to the largely unsettled western areas, in what would become Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and British Columbia. Public policy also served to attract immigration following the passage of the Land Act of 1872, which provided free grants of homesteads to those who settled on the Western Prairie. In the early twentieth century, many immigrants moved from the United States to Canada in search of inexpensive land, and still greater social autonomy. These German-American immigrants brought not only their experience working on the American plains, but had also accrued wealth, giving a much needed boost to the economy of the Western Provinces.\n\nThe Volga Germans that flocked to Canada in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries came from different religious backgrounds including Lutheran, Catholic, and Mennonite. It was this last group, named after leader Menno Simons, that constituted the largest portion of the immigrant population. In Russia they had proven the best organized, preparing scouting parties to investigate the prospect of immigration to Canada and the United States. These scouts had been reliant on the assistance of established Mennonite groups such as those found in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and Ontario. In the period 1873-1879, Mennonites formed blocked settlements in Manitoba with a total of close to 7000 members. Most settled in Southern Manitoba in the richest part of the Red River Valley. These communities were centered around religious homogeneity, and insistence on the tenets of adult baptism, and the refusal to bear arms or swear an oath. Many Mennonites had been propelled to leave because of the introduction of extended conscription, put in place in 1874, but set to take effect in Russia in 1881.\n\nMany Volga Germans emigrated from the United States to the Western Provinces in the period 1890-1909. They sought to escape rising land prices, and imposition of laws that began to encroach on their relative autonomy. Canada was seen as a new frontier, a place of vast land, but little settlement. These immigrants settled mainly in the colonies of St. Peter and St. Joseph, East and West of Saskatoon in Central Saskatchewan. In the 1890s, twelve Catholic families established Rastadt-Dorf, and another twenty-one settled Katherinetal. Additional settlements were begun in Davin, Kronau, and Speyer as well.\n\nIn the period between World War I and World War II, conditions in Russia worsened, especially following the Revolution and the Great Famine of 1921. Many Volga Germans sought to leave the USSR, but faced opposition from a government that did not wish to see so large a portion of its population leave. The Russian government imposed a fee for obtaining a passport, which lead to protests as many would-be immigrants flooded the streets of Moscow. Many Mennonites were eventually able to leave, and between the World Wars, over 20,000 left destined for Canada.\n\nBeginning in the second decade of the twentieth century, and continuing until several years after the Second World War, the ethnic background of the Volga Germans made them prey to discrimination. By 1914, Germany had become Canada's enemy, and the Volga Germans were not immune despite many families having not set foot in Germany for hundreds of years. This period saw the suppression of many German cultural customs, including the suppression of their print media, and the closure of German schools. The Wartime Elections Act, passed in September 1917, revoked the citizenship of any German naturalized after March, 1902. Many settlements were renamed to disguise their obvious German origin.\n\nThe 1920s period also saw the movement of Volga Germans within Western Canada as well. Many pushed further west, settling in British Columbia. The area had the appeal of a warmer climate, an escape from the frigid prairie. Other Volga Germans were propelled by economic factors such as the Great Depression, which not only impoverished many, but also coincided with a tremendous drought ushering in crop failures. The economy of the Prairie Provinces, and much of Canada, was dependent on the success of wheat farming. Wheat had been a staple crop for the Volga Germans in Russia, and translated well to the climate of the Canadian West. Repeated crop failures meant a large influx of the German-Russian population into larger cities and towns, a fact that would contribute to the gradual decline of their culturally homogeneous communities. The prairie lands abutting the United States border experienced Dust Bowl conditions, which sent swarms of families to the coastal areas of British Columbia. Throughout the period following World War II, new immigrants joined their families in British Columbia, congregating in the Fraser Valley, and Vancouver Island. The mid-twentieth century brought immigrants from South American regions, namely Argentina and Brazil, as they fought to maintain their cultural autonomy in increasingly nationalist areas, dominated by nationalist leaders like Juan Perón.\nLutheran and Catholic Volga Germans were also significant migrants to Canada, but lacked the organization of their Mennonite brethren. Early on, these immigrants were more likely to settle in Saskatchewan, especially around the city of Regina. Despite their location near earlier Mennonite communities, settlements remained religiously homogenous.\n\nThroughout their history in the Canadian West, the Volga Germans have been able to maintain many of their cultural characteristics, including their dialect, proliferated through Saturday schools and Canadian policies that allowed for cultural freedom. These schools operated on Saturday mornings for around three hours, and became especially vital as the German language was no longer taught in the Canadian public school system after World War I. The Mennonites, unlike most Volga Germans, were able to maintain these schools even after World War II. The dialect of the Volga Germans was also maintained through the Church, especially in the Mennonite community.\n\nBefore the Volga Germans had left for North America they had been regarded as privileged colonists in Russia. When they arrived in the United States and Canada they found that they were treated the same as any other Eastern European migrant group. The Mennonites may be seen as an exception as they successfully used connections with their brethren in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and Ontario. Through their hard work on the North American plains, they established themselves as a productive portion of Canadian and American society.\n\nThe Germans from Russia originally spoke German dialects such as the Palatine dialect or Mennonite Low German (\"Plautdietsch\") at home. Since the villages in Russia often were populated by settlers from a particular region and were isolated from Germany, they maintained their regional dialects. Depending on their specific dialect, Germans from Russia had difficulties understanding Standard German, because German dialects in general differ greatly from the standard language. After emigrating from Russia to the Americas the Germans still spoke with their German dialects. In the 1950s it was still common for the children in the Dakotas to speak in English and the parents and grandparents to use German. Songs in church would be sung in two languages simultaneously. Probably the person best known for having a \"German from Russia accent\" in English (a result of having learned English as a second language) was bandleader and television star Lawrence Welk.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dedicated in 1893, it commemorates the defendants involved in the labor unrest and bombing related to the Haymarket Affair (1886). On February 18, 1997, it was designated a National Historic Landmark.\n\nFollowing the Haymarket affair, trial and executions, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, George Engel, Louis Lingg, and Albert Parsons were buried at the German Waldheim Cemetery (later merged with Forest Home Cemetery).\n\nThe Pioneer Aid and Support Association organized a subscription for a funeral monument. In 1893, the \"Haymarket Martyrs' Monument\" by sculptor Albert Weinert was raised at Waldheim. It consists of a 16-foot-high granite shaft capped by a carved triangular stone. There is a two step base, which also supports a monumental figure of a woman standing over the body of a fallen worker, both in bronze. It was dedicated on June 25, 1893, after a march from Chicago. The inscription on the steps read, \"1887,\" the year of the executions. Also, there is a quote attributed to Spies, recorded just before his execution by hanging: \"The day will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you are throttling today.\"\n\nOn the back of the monument are listed the names of the men. On the top of the monument, a bronze plaque contains text of the pardon later issued by Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld\n\nThe dedication ceremony was attended by 8,000, with union flags and the American flag draped on the monument. European unions and American organizations sent flowers to be placed. Many activists and labor leaders were subsequently buried nearby. Michael Schwab and Oscar Neebe were also buried at Waldheim when they died. Samuel Fielden is the only Haymarket defendant who is not buried at Forest Home. For years, annual commemorations were held.\n\nSince the 1970s, the Illinois Labor History Society has held the deed to the monument and been responsible for its maintenance and restoration. It conducts monthly guided tours of Forest Home Cemetery from May through October.\n\nIn October 2016, volunteers and scientists dug near the base of the monument, where they recovered a time capsule that had been buried under the cornerstone on November 6, 1892, during the monument's construction. The time capsule, which is tall and wide, was made of stone or concrete and capped in marble. According to a list in the records of the Pioneer Aid and Support Association, the time capsule contained newspaper articles, letters to and from the Haymarket defendants, and photographs of the men and their families. It also held trial documents, essays, and letters and testimonials from a number of labor unions and fraternal organizations. In addition, it may contain a bust of Albert Spies. The time capsule contained an urn instead of what was described in the records. Research is ongoing to determine the location of the time capsule.\n\nDuring the excavation, the volunteers also found a cube that is believed to be the cremation vault for the ashes of Oscar Neebe, who died in 1916. It was sitting on top of the time capsule.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "426740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=426740", "title": "History of the Comecon", "text": "History of the Comecon\n\nThe founding of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (also referred to as Comecon, CMEA, CEMA, or the Council) dates from a January 1949 communiqué agreed upon by the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania in Moscow. The communiqué announcing the event cited the refusal of these countries to \"subordinate themselves to the dictates of the Marshall Plan\" and their intention to resist the trade boycott imposed by \"the United States, Britain and certain other countries of Western Europe\" as the major factors contributing to the decision \"to organize a more broadly based economic cooperation among the countries of the people's democracy and the USSR.\"\n\nThe precise reasons for Comecon's formation in the aftermath of World War II are quite complex, given the political and economic turmoil of that time. However, Joseph Stalin's desire to enforce Soviet domination of the small states of Eastern Europe and to mollify some states that had expressed interest in the Marshall Plan were the primary factors in Comecon's formation. The stated purpose of the organization was to enable member states \"to exchange economic experiences, extend technical aid to one another, and to render mutual assistance with respect to raw materials, foodstuffs, machines, equipment, etc.\"\n\nDuring Comecon's early years (through 1955), its sessions were convened on an \"ad hoc\" basis. The organization lacked clear structure and operated without a charter until a decade after its founding. These loose arrangements reflected the limited goals of Comecon at the time and the character of the Marshall Plan (also governed by a loose structure), to which Comecon served as a response.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1953, Comecon's function consisted primarily of redirecting commerce of member countries toward each other and introducing import replacement industries, thus making members economically more self-sufficient. Little was done to solve economic problems through a regional policy. This was a period, moreover, when their first five-year plans, formulated along the Soviet model, preoccupied the East European members. In the headlong pursuit of parallel industrialization strategies, East European governments turned their attention inward. Because of Stalin's distrust of multilateral bodies, bilateral ties with the Soviet Union quickly came to dominate the East European members' external relations. Each country dealt with the Soviets on a one-to-one basis by means of direct consultations with Moscow through local Soviet missions. Although reparations transfers (extracted by the Soviet Union to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and former Slovakia, who were Axis' allies during World War II) had been replaced by more normal trade relations, outstanding reparations obligations were not halted until 1956. In these circumstances, there was scarcely need or scope for multilateral policies or institutions.\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, however, new leaders and new approaches emerged in the countries of the region. The more industrialized and the more trade dependent of the East European countries (Czechoslovakia, East Germany, and Poland) had belatedly recognized the need to adapt the Soviet autarkic model to their own requirements. New approaches to foreign trade emerged during discussions of economic reform. Given their isolation from the rest of the world and the dominance of intrabloc trade in their external relations, interest in these countries inevitably centered on new forms of regional cooperation. For small, centrally planned economies, this meant the need to develop a mechanism through which to coordinate investment and trade policies.\n\nInstability in Eastern Europe and integration in Western Europe increased the desirability of regularizing intrabloc relations in a more elaborate institutional framework. The 1955 Warsaw Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance and its implementing machinery reinforced political-military links. On the economic front, Comecon was rediscovered. The example of the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which initiated the processes of West European economic integration, gave impetus and direction to Comecon's revival.\n\nThe years 1956 to 1963 witnessed the rapid growth of Comecon institutions and activities, especially after the 1959 Charter went into effect. Comecon, for example, launched a program to unify the electrical power systems of its member-states and in 1962 created the Central Dispatching Board to manage the unified system. The organization took similar steps to coordinate railroad and river transport. In 1963 a special bank, the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, was created to facilitate financial settlements among members. In this period, Comecon also undertook a number of bilateral and multilateral investment projects. The most notable project led to the coordinated construction of the Druzhba oil pipeline for the transport and distribution of crude oil from the Soviet Union to Eastern Europe. The joint Institute for Nuclear Research, established in 1956, initiated cooperation in another area of long-term importance.\n\nParallel to these developments, the Soviet Union led efforts to coordinate the investment strategies of the members in the interest of a more rational pattern of regional specialization, increased productivity, and a more rapid overtaking of the capitalist economies. These efforts culminated in 1962 with the adoption at the 15th Council Session of the Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labor. Although the principles of specialization were generally favored by the more industrial, northern-tier states, the less developed East European countries were concerned that such specialization would lead to a concentration of industry in the already established centers and would thus thwart their own ambitious industrialization plans. Moreover, the increased economic interdependence that the Basic Principles called for had inevitable political connotations. The latter were reinforced in 1962 by articles and speeches by Soviet party leader Nikita Khrushchev proposing a central Comecon planning organ to implement the Basic Principles and foreseeing the evolution of a \"socialist commonwealth\" based on a unified regional economy.\n\nThese proposals provoked strong and open reaction from Romania on the grounds of \"sovereign equality\" of members, as articulated most forcefully in the April 1964 Declaration of the Romanian Central Committee. Romania's opposition (combined with the more passive resistance of some other members) succeeded in forestalling supranational planning and reinforcing the interested-party provisions of the Charter. The institutional compromise was the creation of the Bureau for Integrated Planning, which was attached to the Executive Committee and limited to an advisory role on coordination of members' development plans. The Basic Principles, having lost their momentum, were superseded several years later by the Comprehensive Program.\n\nAfter the fall of Khrushchev in 1964, the new Soviet leadership was preoccupied with internal matters, and the East European countries were themselves busy with programs of economic reform. A comparative lull in Comecon activities ensued, which lasted until well after the 1968 Soviet-led intervention in Czechoslovakia. By the end of the 1960s, Eastern Europe had been shaken by the 1968 events, and there was an obvious need to revitalize programs that would strengthen regional cohesion.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the question of how to proceed with plans for economic integration received considerable discussion in specialized journals and at international meetings of experts. Disillusioned by traditional instruments and concerned with the need to decentralize planning and management in their domestic economies, the reformers argued for the strengthening of market relations among Comecon states. The conservatives continued to stress the importance of planned approaches. If carried to a logical extreme, the latter would involve supranational planning of major aspects of members' economies and the inevitable loss of national autonomy over domestic investment policy. The old conflict between planned approaches to regional specialization and the principle of sovereign equality could not be avoided in any discussion of the mechanism for future cooperation.\n\nThe controversy over supranational planning led to a compromise in the form of the 1971 Comprehensive Program for the Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and the Further Development of Socialist Economic Integration, which laid the guidelines for Comecon activity through 1990. The Comprehensive Program incorporated elements of both the market and the plan approaches. Following the market approach, the Comprehensive Program sought to strengthen the role of money, prices, and exchange rates in intra-Comecon relations and to encourage direct contacts among lower level economic entities in the member countries. At the same time, the Comprehensive Program called for more joint planning on a sectoral basis through interstate bodies that would coordinate members' activities in a given sector. New organs were also envisaged in the form of international associations that would engage in actual operations in a designated sector on behalf of the participating countries. Finally, the Comprehensive Program emphasized the need for multilateral projects to develop new regional sources of fuels, energy, and raw materials. Such projects were to be jointly planned, financed, and executed.\n\nThe Comprehensive Program introduced a new concept in relations among members: \"socialist economic integration.\" Section I, Paragraph 2 of the Comprehensive Program refers to the need \"to intensify and improve\" cooperation among members and \"to develop socialist economic integration.\" This phrasing, which has since become standard, implies that the latter is a new and higher level of interaction, \"a process of the international socialist division of labor, the drawing closer of [member states'] economies and the formation of modern, highly effective national economic structures.\" The Comprehensive Program avoids, however, the suggestion of ultimate fusion of members' economies that had been contained in the 1962 Basic Principles. It sets limits to the integrative process in the following terms: \"Socialist economic integration is completely voluntary and does not involve the creation of supranational bodies.\"\n\nThe term integration had formerly been used to designate the activities of Western regional organizations such as the European Economic Community. Its new usage in the Comprehensive Program suggested parity of status between Comecon and the EEC. Under subsequent amendments to its Charter, the competence of Comecon to deal with other international organizations and third countries on behalf of its members was made clear. Comecon sought to attract the participation of developing countries in its activities. The language of the Comprehensive Program may thus also be regarded as an attempt to revitalize the image of Comecon in order to make association with it an attractive alternative to associated status with the EEC.\n\nComecon members adopted the Comprehensive Program at a time when they were actively developing economic relations with the rest of the world, especially with the industrialized Western economies. The Comprehensive Program viewed the two sets of policies as complementary and affirmed that \"because the international socialist division of labor is effected with due account taken of the world division of labor, the Comecon member countries shall continue to develop economic, scientific, and technological ties with other countries, irrespective of their social and political system.\"\n\nIn the years following the adoption of the Comprehensive Program, Comecon made some progress toward strengthening market relations among members. The Comprehensive Program's objectives proved somewhat inconsistent with the predominant trends within members' economies in the 1970s, which was a period of recentralization — rather than decentralization — of domestic systems of planning and management. The major exception to this lack of progress lay in the area of intra-Comecon pricing and payment, where the expansion of relations with the West contributed to the adoption of prices and extra-plan settlements closer to international norms. Achievements under the Comprehensive Program have fallen under the heading of planned approaches, especially in the area of joint resource development projects. A second Comecon bank, the International Investment Bank, was established in 1970 to provide a mechanism for the joint financing of such projects. In 1973 Comecon decided to draw up a general plan incorporating these measures. A number of projects formulated in the years immediately following adoption of the Comprehensive Program were then assembled in a document signed at the 29th Council Session in 1975. Entitled the \"Concerted Plan for Multilateral Integration Measures,\" the document covered the 1976-80 five-year-plan period and was proclaimed as the first general plan for the Comecon economies. The joint projects included in the plan were largely completed in the course of the plan period.\n\nA second major initiative toward implementation of the Comprehensive Program came in 1976 at the 30th Council Session, when a decision was made to draw up Long-Term Target Programs for Cooperation in major economic sectors and subsectors. The session designated a number of objectives to which target programs would be directed: \"guarantee of the economically based requirements of Comecon member countries for basic kinds of energy, fuels, and raw materials; the development of the machine-building industries on the basis of intense specialization and cooperation in production; the fulfillment of national demands for basic foodstuffs and industrial consumer goods; and modernization and development of transport links among member countries.\" The 32d Council Session, held in 1978, approved target programs for cooperation through 1990 in the first two areas, as well as in agriculture and the food industries. These programs established the commitments to multilateral cooperation that member countries were to take into account when drawing up their five-year plans for the 1980s.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, with the exception of Poland's agricultural sector, the economic sectors of all Comecon countries had converted to the socialist system. Member states had restructured their economies to emphasize industry, transportation, communications, and material and technical supply, and they had decreased the share of resources devoted to agricultural development. Within industry, member states devoted additional funds to machine building and production of chemicals. Socialist economic integration resulted in the production of goods capable of competing on the world market.\n\nMost Comecon countries ended their 1981-85 five-year plans with decreased extensive economic development, increased expenses for fuel and raw materials, and decreased dependency on the West for both credit and hard currency imports. In the early 1980s, external economic relations had greater impact on the Comecon countries than ever before. When extending credit to East European countries, Western creditors did so assuming that the Soviet Union would offer financial assistance in the event that payment difficulties arose. This principle, which has always been rejected in the East bloc, proved inoperable in the aftermath of the Polish crisis of 1979-82. The sharp rise in interest rates in the West put the Polish debt at an excessively high level, beyond the amount that the Soviet Union could cover. The resulting liquidity shortage that occurred in all Comecon countries in 1981 forced them to reduce hard-currency imports.\n\nIn the 1980s, high interest rates and the increased value of the United States dollar on international markets made debt servicing more expensive. Thus, reducing indebtedness to the West also became a top priority within Comecon. From 1981 to 1985, the European countries of Comecon attempted to promote the faster growth of exports over imports and sought to strengthen intraregional trade, build up an increased trade surplus, and decrease indebtedness to Western countries.\n\nIn the 1980s, Comecon sessions were held on their regular annual schedule. The two most notable meetings were the special sessions called in June 1984 and December 1985. The first summit-level meeting of Comecon member states in fifteen years was held with much fanfare on June 12–14 June 1984, in Moscow (the 23d \"Special\" Session of Comecon Member Countries). The meeting was held to discuss coordination of economic strategy and long-term goals in view of the \"differing perspectives and contrary interests\" that had developed among Comecon members since 1969. More specifically, the two fundamental objectives of the meeting were to strengthen unity among members and establish a closer connection between the production base, scientific and technological progress, and capital construction. However, despite the introduction of proposals for improving efficiency and cooperation in six key areas, Western and some Eastern analysts claimed that the meeting was anticlimactic and even a failure.\n\nThe ideas and results of the June 14 session were elaborated at the Extraordinary 41st Council Session, which was held on December 17–18, 1985, in Moscow. The meeting was heralded in the Comecon community as \"one of the more memorable events in Comecon history.\" This special session featured the culmination of several years of work on the new Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress up to the Year 2000. It aimed to create \"a firm base for working out an agreed, and in some areas, unified scientific and technical policy and the practical implementation, in the common interest, of higher achievements in science and technology.\"\n\nThe Comprehensive Program for Scientific and Technical Progress up to the Year 2000 was originally to be ratified in 1986, but the Soviets advocated an earlier date of completion to enable the Comecon countries to incorporate their commitments to implement the program in their next five-year plans (which started in January 1986). The program laid out sizable tasks in five key areas: electronics, automation systems, nuclear energy, development of new materials, and biotechnology. It sought to restructure and modernize the member states' economies to counteract constraints on labor and material supplies. The need to move to intensive production techniques within Comecon was evident from the fact that from 1961 to 1984 the overall material intensiveness of production did not improve substantially. The 1985 program provided a general framework for Comecon's new direction of development. Details were to be settled in bilateral agreements.\n\nWith the end of Communism in Eastern Europe, Comecon ceased to exist on June 28, 1991.\n\n"}

There was one report last year of a male teenager from Nigeria rescued from the commercial sex trade in Denmark. The government did not report any cases of forced labor during the reporting period, though the Danish Anti-Trafficking Center highlighted that workers in domestic service, restaurants, hotels, factories, and agriculture, may be vulnerable to forced labor in Denmark. There were unconfirmed reports of foreign children being forced to engage in organized street crime. The government released a report in 2010 about increasing evidence that “au pair” organizations could be used as front companies for human trafficking. The hundreds of unaccompanied foreign minors who arrive in Denmark every year are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. The U.S. State Department placed the country in \"Tier 1\" in their 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report.\n\nDenmark prohibits both sex and labor trafficking through Section 262 of its criminal code. Punishments prescribed for trafficking under section 262 extend up to eight years’ imprisonment, are sufficiently stringent, and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Police reported conducting a total of 44 human trafficking investigations during the reporting period. Using Section 262, the government prosecuted 25 people for sex trafficking and convicted 11 sex trafficking offenders in 2009. The government prosecuted additional alleged sex trafficking offenders under other statutes, such as prostitution procurement. All 11 trafficking offenders convicted in 2009 served some time in prison; none received suspended sentences. Sentences for convicted trafficking offenders ranged from 5 to 42 months’ imprisonment. The Danish national police provided anti-trafficking training to all police precincts and new police recruits during the reporting period, and police leadership has taken a strategic approach to addressing the crime; however, the effectiveness of this training is still undetermined.\n\nDenmark sustained its victim assistance and protection efforts over the year. In addition to employing formal victim identification procedures, the government conducted a proactive victim identification outreach program, interviewing people in prostitution, as well as in prisons and asylum centers, in an attempt to identify and rescue trafficking victims. The government identified 54 victims during the reporting period, down from 72 identified the previous year. The government offered medical, dental, psychological, and legal services, and in certain cases a stipend, to victims of trafficking during a 100-day reflection period – a time for victims to receive immediate care and assistance while they considered whether to assist law enforcement. There were two government-funded crisis centers for female victims of violence, which accommodated women trafficking victims. There were no specific shelter facilities for male victims, but at least one government-funded NGO offered assistance to men. The government offered child trafficking victims additional social services and placement in shelters or foster care. No support is provided to adult or child foreign victims of trafficking in Denmark beyond the reflection period if asylum or residency is not granted.\n\nThe government encouraged victims to assist in investigations of their traffickers, including by offering support of trained counselors during police interviews; however, many victims did not cooperate. It has been Danish NGOs’ experience that 100 days is often not enough time for victims to develop sufficient trust in local authorities to disclose details of their trafficking experience. In addition, after the reflection period and trial process, victims of trafficking are most often deported to their country of origin, where authorities may not be able to provide protection. Trafficking victims were eligible to apply for asylum as an alternative to their removal to countries in which they would face retribution or hardship. This year, six people were determined by the Danish Immigration Service to be victims of trafficking and had asylum cases pending during the reporting period; one victim from 2008 was granted asylum in 2009. Police acknowledged factors preventing victims’ cooperation with police, including fear of reprisal from traffickers and the knowledge they were going back to their home country. Denmark sustained partnerships with IOM and NGOs in victims’ countries of origin to facilitate safe repatriation. The government provided foreign unaccompanied minors, regardless of whether or not they were suspected victims of trafficking, with a representative to assist with asylum applications or repatriation; however, it was documented that some children were placed in police custody for arriving with forged documents, a crime often occurring as a direct result of being trafficked. Danish victim advocates reported that Danish police generally respected the rights of victims, but claimed victims have been prosecuted for crimes committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\n\nWhile there is currently no nationwide government-sponsored anti-trafficking awareness campaign focused on all forms of trafficking, the government continued a campaign begun in 2008 called “Who Pays the Price?” to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, which may be linked to sex trafficking. The government had an anti-trafficking action plan, and the government produced an annual status report monitoring the previous year’s developments related to the plan. The government forged anti-trafficking partnerships through its funding of anti-trafficking programs in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova. Danish authorities sustained partnerships with Scandinavian Airlines, the Association of Danish Travel Agents, and Save the Children to disseminate public service announcements against child sex tourism. Denmark established a hotline for trafficking victims and one for information about suspected child sex tourism overseas. The government did not report any prosecutions of its citizens for child sex tourism during the reporting period. The Ministry of Defence provided training on human trafficking to all soldiers prior to their deployment abroad on international peacekeeping missions.\n"}

John Boy was the eldest of eight children living is South Central, Los Angeles, California. After his father refused to work, the family was forced to look into welfare as a means of support. In 1970, when John Watts was 12 years of age, he found himself hustling on the streets to help provide additional food for his mother and his younger siblings.\n\nIn 1978 he formed a dancing group called The Robot Brothers that consisted of his two youngest brothers and himself. They performed on \"The Tonight Show\" hosted by Bill Cosby and even \"The Gong Show\". Their performances generated enough money to help keep a roof over their head and food on the table, but in 1981 his brother Chris decided to leave the group and joined Crips, a notorious street gang in Los Angeles. Chris' departure ended the group.\n\nSoon after, John Watts found himself needing to generate income. The easy way was to make a quick entry and exit into the drug game. John stole three hundred dollars from his mother's rent money and used it to purchase 3 grams worth cocaine from a local drug dealer. A few months later John rented a small one-bed apartment in L.A.'s Westside and turned into a Crack House. Nine months and two million dollars later he stopped and walked away from the drug dealing business. He moved his mother into a home he purchased in Pasadena Hills California.\n\nWatt's desire to leave the drug dealing world was evident. In 1985 he opened a hair salon in Inglewood, California, his first legitimate business venture. His business venture came to an end when his salon later caught on fire and burned to the ground closing his business. Being determined not to give up, John Watts took his $133,000 insurance settlement and used it to open his second business which was a club in Marina Del Ray in 1986. The club business was successful until 1988 when an individual was gunned down inside his establishment. Customers started to stop coming to his establishment and once again John Watts found him losing money.\n\nIn 1988, Watt entered into a drug deal that went bad when he met with so-called drug dealer. The deal was to purchase 225 kilos for $3.2M. What he thought was a legitimate deal turned out to be a set up by the Lennox Sheriff's department. John Watts was arrested and sentenced to six years in state prison.\n\nAfter serving 33 months, John was released back the streets on March 29, 1991. John, still determined to help support his family, opened up his own Home Health Care Agency in Culver City, California. After being in business for 13 months his business was closed after Medicare accused him over billing his them an estimated $5 million. On Labor Day 1994 the FBI served him with an indictment for Medicare fraud charges. On May 2, 2000, John was once again sentenced to 42 months in Federal Prison. He was also sentenced to 78 months for income Tax Fraud.\n\nWhile in prison John S. Watts Jr. wrote 39 books and once released from prison he wrote one additional book. In 2012 one of his best friends, Ice-T invested $20,000 into John S. Watts Jr. publishing company. He has also written six movie scripts, 21 business plans and ideas, and four reality shows. Currently, Watts has launched John Boy Entertainment which consists of three upcoming reality shows including 'Your Daddy Knows Best' and 'Life After Prison'.\n\nIn 2018, Watts appeared on \"\" with his daughter, Apple.\n\n"}

The journal has been closely related historically with a similar online website, Cosmology (or Cosmology.com). The journal was established in 2009 and is published by Cosmology Science Publishers. Rudolph Schild is the editor-in-chief and executive editor.\n\nThe \"Journal of Cosmology\" is an online publication website. The journal publishes original hypotheses and discoveries in cosmology, astronomy, astrobiology, and Earth and planetary sciences. Contributions may cover multiple disciplines and sub-disciplines of biology, geology, physics, chemistry, extinction, the origin and evolution of life, panspermia and Martian colonization and exploration.\n\nIn general, published papers present original hypotheses, reviews, commentary, and speculation. Also covered is analysis of similarities and differences between competing hypotheses (Big Bang vs Steady State theory, panspermia vs abiogenesis, etc.).\n\nIn June 2013, the journal launched a public invitation for theologians, theological ethicists and philosophers to contribute articles on \"astro-theology\".\n\nThe quality of peer review at the journal has been questioned. The journal has also been accused of promoting fringe viewpoints and speculative viewpoints on astrobiology, astrophysics, and quantum physics. Skeptical blogger and biologist PZ Myers said of the journal \"... it isn't a real science journal at all, but is the... website of a small group... obsessed with the idea of Hoyle and Wickramasinghe that life originated in outer space and simply rained down on Earth.\"\nThe journal has responded that the paradigm \"life on Earth came from Earth\" is like a religious belief.\n\nScientists who have posted accounts of personal attacks by the journal's staff members include Susan Blackmore, David Brin, and PZ Myers.\n\nIn early March 2011, the journal drew widespread controversy for the publication of a paper by Richard B. Hoover a retired NASA scientist, with claims of evidence in meteorites that life on Earth could have come from space, in this case debris carrying life from a comet to Earth. The journal dismissed the criticism as \"a barrage of slanderous attacks\" from \"crackpots and charlatans\", calling their own journal courageous for resisting the \"terrorists\" whose actions they equated with the Inquisition. NASA distanced itself from Hoover's findings, and issued a statement saying that the paper had been previously submitted in 2007 to \"International Journal of Astrobiology\" which did not accept it for review.\nA number of commentaries on the paper were also published.\n\nIn an open letter to the editors of \"Science\" and \"Nature,\" Rudolph Schild proposed to establish a commission to investigate the validity of the Hoover paper, which would be led by three experts appointed by \"Journal of Cosmology\", \"Science\" and \"Nature\". Schild said he would interpret \"any refusal to cooperate, no matter what the excuse\" from \"Nature\" or \"Science\" as \"vindication for the \"Journal of Cosmology\" and the Hoover paper, and an acknowledgment that the editorial policies of the \"Journal of Cosmology\" are beyond reproach\". They subsequently issued another statement in which they stood by their publication process and suggested that criticisms were \"slander and histrionic tirades\", and comparing their critics to \"lunatics... unleashed to throw filth\", suggesting that their own actions were part of a 2000-years struggle of science against religion. Since their critics had \"refused to cooperate\" in a review, they reaffirmed the study to be \"beyond reproach\".\nThe James Randi Educational Foundation awarded Hoover the tongue-in-cheek Pigasus Award, for repeatedly announcing, \"[a]long with the crackpot \"Journal of Cosmology\"\", widely dismissed claims that he had found signs of life in Mars rocks.\n\nOn January 17, 2014, NASA reported that a martian rock, named \"Pinnacle Island\", that was not in an \"Opportunity\" rover image taken on Sol 3528, \"mysteriously\" appeared 13 days later in a similar image taken on Sol 3540. One possible explanation, presented by Steven Squyres, principal investigator of the Mars Exploration Rover Mission, was that the rover, in one of its turning motions, flicked the rock from a few feet away and into the new location. In response to the finding, Rhawn Joseph published an article in the \"Journal of Cosmology\" on January 17, 2014, concluding that the object is in fact a living organism resembling apothecia. Rhawn Joseph then filed a writ of mandamus on January 27, 2014 in San Francisco Federal Court, demanding that NASA examine the rock more closely. However, NASA already had examined the rock on January 8, 2014 and confirmed it was a rock with a high sulphur, manganese, and magnesium content. According to Squyres, \"We have looked at it with our microscope. It is clearly a rock.\" On February 14, 2014, NASA released showing the location from where the \"Pinnacle Island\" rock was dislodged by the \"Opportunity\" rover.\n\nThe \"Journal of Cosmology\" is abstracted and indexed in Polymer Library and ProQuest databases. From 2009 until 2011 it was indexed in the Astrophysics Data System.\n\n"}

A scholarship corpus fund started in the 1960s, has facilitated financial assistance even to this day, to several deserving students of the Mangalorean Catholic Community in Bangalore.\n\nKCA is a major contributor in terms of land and funds to the Konkan Samudai Bhavan (KSB), which is a state of the art building to help members of the Kanara Catholic Community. One of the major aims of the KSB is to provide highly subsidised accommodations for Catholic youth who come from the Konkan area to Bangalore in search of jobs or help in the early part of their careers. The KSB is also there to help the Kanara Catholic Community to host their cultural events and other events to ensure the progress of the community.\n\nIn a Landmark event, during the Annual General Body meeting of 2018, the Chief Postmaster General of Karnataka, Government of India, His Excellency, Dr. Charles Lobo, in the presence of members and the newly elected committee, released a stamp commemorating the Monti Fest Festival of the Mangalorean catholics, which is celebrated worldwide by the community on September 8th to honour the Virgin Mary and is connected to the Harvest festival which is also celebrated in India with great gusto.\n\nKCA Bangalore was started in 1955 thanks to the initiative of early residents Leo D'Silva, Public Notary and John D'Sa, who was later Chief Engineer of the Karnataka State Government Electricity Board and Capt. Dr. George Mathias - a well-known coffee planter. The early meetings were in the legendary Oorgaum House, the home of Rajpramukh PG D'Souza. Its mission was to promote cohesiveness and camaraderie within the community through social events, picnics and sports. KCA became a Registered body in 1988. The membership and Articles of Association were revised in 1994.\n\nThe Annual General Body Meeting of KCA has traditionally included a Church Service in Konkani, followed by lunch and entertainment. From 1993, an annual church service for Departed Members, Thanksgiving Mass in April after Easter, and Montichefest Mass in September with well-organized liturgy and choir is always conducted without fail. Cultural events have evolved from modest social gatherings in the 1950s, which introduced a touch of culture with the colourful mando, to 1995, when a cultural troupe from Mangalore led by Bennet Pinto were invited to perform at the 40th Anniversary celebration of KCA at St. Germains School, Bangalore. Cultural programmes have become a rallying force to bring the community together to participate, have fellowship, celebrate and contribute to charity causes. From 2000 onwards, \"Mango Showers\" and later Mood Manglowrean have showcased Mangalorean cultural heritage through skits, plays, music, dance and songs with large numbers of cultural events to promote the cohesion of the Mangalorean catholic community, which has been decreasing in numbers in India.\n\nKCA also publishes a quarterly Newsletter called 'Khobar' from 1994. In 1995, the first Directory of Members was published. A Land and Building Fund was instituted in 1985 to harness donations from the community for charitable causes, resulting in a plot of land purchased 10 years later. Raising funds for a building turned out to be a major hurdle. In 2016, through the herculean efforts of the Konkan Welfare Trust- a joint collaboration of KCA and KONCAB, and substantial assistance from many individual benefactors both in India and across the World, a magnificent community building consisting of a hall and hostel called the Konkan Samudai Bhavan was completed.\n\nA tradition is also the annual Thanksgiving Mass, held every year, after Easter. Donations and proceeds from this mass are given to other catholic organisations who cater to less privileged members of society. In the last few years, donations from these masses have been given to the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Leprosy Home at Sumanahally Bangalore, the home for AIDS patients on Sarjapur Road run by the Camillian Fathers, Asha Niketan Koramangala a home for the intellectually disabled, part of the L'Arch communities started by Jean Vanier in France in 1970 and others\n\nThe KCA celebrated its golden jubilee in 2004-2005 under the stewardship of the first Lady President of KCA, Dr. Pat Pinto.\n\nThe KCA is run by an Honorary Committee which is elected by the AGM every year. Committee members are responsible for organising all the KCA events, with all the proceeds going to charity.\n"}

Legatum is a partnership that uses its own funds to invest globally. The firm also invests in activities to promote entrepreneurship and free enterprise as well as anti-slavery, health and education initiatives.\n\nLegatum (meaning \"legacy\" or \"gift\") is a private investment firm based in Dubai using only capital provided by members of the firm. Legatum was founded in December 2006 in the United Arab Emirates by Christopher Chandler, who made his fortune in markets undergoing political disruption. Previously, Chandler was the president of Sovereign Global, or Sovereign, which he co-founded with his brother Richard Chandler in 1986. Sovereign invested capital in companies located in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in industries including telecommunications, electric utilities, steel, oil and gas, banking and oil refining. The Chandler brothers embarked on separate ventures following the de-merger of Sovereign in 2006. Christopher Chandler established Legatum the following December. In 2015, Legatum transitioned to a partnership, consisting of Christopher Chandler, Mark Stoleson, Philip Vassiliou and Alan McCormick, providing a structure for the firm to continue operating beyond its founders. \n\nIn 2012, Legatum purchased a building in the Dubai International Financial Centre for its global headquarters. The building was renamed Legatum Plaza, and the company moved into the building the following year. \n\nThe firm's investment activities tend to focus on globally listed companies, markets in economic transition (such as Japan or China) or distressed situations.\n\nLegatum was one of the first foreign commercial investors to identify the need to provide critical equity capital to for-profit microfinance organizations in India, investing $25 million for a majority stake in SHARE Microfinance, India's leading microfinance institution.\n\nIn 2006, the company co-founded an early charity crowdfunding platform, Razoo Global Corporation, based in Alexandria, VA. The platform has raised US$550 million in crowdfunding since its foundation. It announced a management buy-out of Legatum's holding in 2017.\n\nIn 2007, Legatum purchased a significant minority stake in Intellecap, which provides business solutions to help support companies that are dedicated to social and environmental change.\n\nAlso in 2008, Legatum and Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm founded by Pierre Omidyar, collaborated to co-invest a total of $40 million into Unitus Equity Fund II (now known as Elevar Equity). The fund is a commercial venture providing capital to businesses in the developing world targeted at serving the poor. \n\nAs of 2014, Legatum had invested around US$80 million in 1,440 projects in 107 countries. Legatum focuses on three core areas of philanthropic investment: development, entrepreneurship, and policy innovation.\n\nLegatum Foundation is the development arm of Legatum and invests in community-based organizations and projects around the world to help the poorest and most marginalized people in society. In 2015, Legatum established the Luminos Fund, a private donor philanthropic fund designed to develop and scale initiatives which help out-of-school children get back to school.\n\nLegatum founded the END Fund in 2012 to co-ordinate and support programmes to treat neglected tropical diseases, which affects over 1.5 billion people globally.\n\nIn 2013, in partnership with Humanity United and Walk Free, Legatum established a $100 million fund called the Freedom Fund. The aim of the fund is to help eradicate modern day slavery, an illegal industry that generates over $32 billion in profits every year around the world. \n\nIn 2007, Legatum established The Legatum Center for Entrepreneurship at MIT with the aim to create a generation of business leaders in developing countries by providing them with the skills needed to succeed as entrepreneurs. Fellowships are granted to students who show entrepreneurial ambition and an interest in making a lasting and positive economic impact on low-income countries. \n\nLegatum established the annual Africa Awards for Entrepreneurship program which recognizes and rewards business leaders who serve as role models to Africa's aspiring entrepreneurs. The program has been in operation since 2007 and is now run by the African Leadership Network, with Legatum still involved as a lead sponsor.\n\nIn 2008, Legatum partnered with \"Fortune\" magazine to announce the Legatum Fortune Technology Prize, a $1 million award intended to reward for-profit businesses who provide products and services to the needy through the use of technology.\n\nBy 2014, the Center had launched over 20 enterprises across 40 countries. The Legatum fellows have pursued businesses that tackle social issues such as improving sanitation by converting waste products into fertilizer in Kenya, establishing plastic recycling businesses in Nigeria, and improving the apparel industry's conditions in Tanzania.\n\nLegatum Foundation is a sponsor of the Legatum Institute, an independent non-partisan policy, advisory and advocacy organization based in London.\n\n"}

{"id": "279720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=279720", "title": "Malays (ethnic group)", "text": "Malays (ethnic group)\n\nMalays (, Jawi: أورڠ ملايو) are an Austronesian ethnic group that predominantly inhabit the Malay Peninsula, eastern Sumatra and coastal Borneo, as well as the smaller islands which lie between these locations — areas that are collectively known as the Malay world. These locations today are part of the modern nations of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, and southern Thailand.\n\nThere is considerable genetic, linguistic, cultural, and social diversity among the many Malay subgroups, mainly due to hundreds of years of immigration and assimilation of various regional ethnicity and tribes within Maritime Southeast Asia. Historically, the Malay population is descended primarily from the earlier Malayic-speaking Austronesians and Austroasiatic tribes who founded several ancient maritime trading states and kingdoms, notably Brunei, Kedah, Langkasuka, Gangga Negara, Chi Tu, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Pahang, Melayu and Srivijaya.\n\nThe advent of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century triggered a major revolution in Malay history, the significance of which lies in its far-reaching political and cultural legacy. Common definitive markers of a Malayness – the religion of Islam, the Malay language and traditions – are thought to have been promulgated during this era, resulting in the ethnogenesis of the Malay as a major ethnoreligious group in the region. In literature, architecture, culinary traditions, traditional dress, performing arts, martial arts, and royal court traditions, Malacca set a standard that later Malay sultanates emulated. The golden age of the Malay sultanates in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo saw many of their inhabitants, particularly from various tribal communities like the Batak, Dayak, Orang Asli and the Orang laut become subject to Islamisation and Malayisation. Today, some Malays have recent forebears from other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia, termed as \"anak dagang\" (\"traders\") and who predominantly consist of Banjar, Bugis, Minangkabau people and Acehnese peoples, while some are also descended from more recent immigrants from other countries.\n\nThroughout their history, the Malays have been known as a coastal-trading community with fluid cultural characteristics. They absorbed, shared and transmitted numerous cultural features of other local ethnic groups, such as those of Minang, Acehnese, and to some degree Javanese culture; however Malay culture differs by being more overtly Islamic than the multi-religious Javanese culture. Ethnic Malays are also the major source of the ethnocultural development of the related Betawi, Banjar, Cape Malay, Cocos Malays and Sri Lankan Malay cultures, as well as the development of Malay trade and creole languages like Ambonese Malay, Baba Malay, the Betawi language and Manado Malay.\n\nThe epic literature, the \"Malay Annals\", associates the etymological origin of \"Melayu\" to \"Sungai Melayu\" ('Melayu river') in Sumatra, Indonesia. The term is thought to be derived from the Malay word \"melaju\", a combination of the verbal prefix 'me' and the root word 'laju', meaning \"to accelerate\", used to describe the accelerating strong current of the river.\n\nThe word \"Melayu\" as an ethnonym, to allude to a clearly different ethnological cluster, is assumed to have been made fashionable throughout the integration of the Malacca Sultanate as a regional power in the 15th century. It was applied to report the social partialities of the Malaccans as opposed to foreigners as of the similar area, especially the Javanese and Thais This is evidenced from the early 16th century Malay word-list by Antonio Pigafetta who joined the Magellan's circumnavigation, that made a reference to how the phrase \"chiara Malaiu\" ('Malay ways') was used in the maritime Southeast Asia, to refer to the \"al parlare de Malaea\" (Italian for \"to speak of Malacca\").\n\nThe English term \"Malay\" was adopted via the Dutch word Malayo, itself derived from , which originates from the original Malay word, Melayu.\n\nPrior to the 15th century, the term \"Melayu\" and its similar-sounding variants appear to apply as an old toponym to the Strait of Malacca region in general.\n\n\nOther suggestions include the Javanese word \"mlayu\" (to run) derived from \"mlaku\" (to walk or to travel), or the Malay term \"melaju\" (to steadily accelerate), referring to the high mobility and migratory nature of its people, however these suggestions remain as popular beliefs without corroborating evidence.\n\nAlso known as \"Melayu asli\" (aboriginal Malays) or \"Melayu purba\" (ancient Malays), the Proto-Malays are of Austronesian origin and thought to have migrated to the Malay archipelago in a long series of migrations between 2500 and 1500 BC. \"The Encyclopedia of Malaysia: Early History\", has pointed out a total of three theories of the origin of Malays:\n\nThe Deutero-Malays are Iron Age people descended partly from the subsequent Austronesian peoples who came equipped with more advanced farming techniques and new knowledge of metals. The Deutero-Malay settlers were not nomadic compared to their predecessors, instead they settled and established kampungs which serve as the main units in the society. These kampungs were normally situated on the riverbanks or coastal areas and generally self-sufficient in food and other necessities. By the end of the last century BC, these kampungs beginning to engage in some trade with the outside world.\nThe Deutero-Malays are considered the direct ancestors of present-day Malay people. Notable Proto-Malays of today are Moken, Jakun, Orang Kuala, Temuan and Orang Kanaq.\n\nA more recent theory holds that rather than being populated by expansion from the mainland, the Ice Age populations of the Malay peninsula, neighbouring Indonesian archipelago, and the then-exposed continental shelf (Sundaland) instead developed locally from the first human settlers and expanded to the mainland. Proponents of this theory hold that this expansion gives a far more parsimonious explanation of the linguistic, archaeological, and anthropological evidence than earlier models, particularly the Taiwan model. This theory also draws support from recent genetic evidence by Human Genome Organisation suggesting that the primary peopling of Asia occurred in a single migration through Southeast Asia; this route is held to be the modern Malay area and that the diversity in the area developed mainly in-place without requiring major migrations from the mainland. The expansion itself may have been driven by rising sea levels at the end of the Ice Age.\n\nProponent Stephen Oppenheimer has further theorised that the expansion of peoples occurred in three rapid surges due to rising sea levels at the end of the Ice Age, and that this diaspora spread the peoples and their associated cultures, myths, and technologies not just to mainland Southeast Asia, but as far as India, the Near East, and the Mediterranean. Reviewers have found his proposals for the original settlement and dispersal worthy of further study, but have been sceptical of his more diffusionist claims.\n\nStudies on the genetics of modern Malays show a complex history of admixture of human populations. The analyses reveal that the Malays are genetically diverse, and that there are substantial variations between different populations of Malays. The differences may have arisen from geographical isolation and independent admixture that occurred over a long period. The studies indicate that there is no single representative genetic component, rather there are four major ancestral components to the Malay people: Austronesian, Proto-Malay, East Asian and South Asian. The largest components of the genetic makeup of the Malays come from the Austronesian aborigines and Proto-Malays. The Austronesian component is related to the Taiwanese Ami and Atayal people, and genetic analyses of the Austronesian component in Southeast Asians may lend support to the \"Out of Taiwan\" hypothesis, although some suggest that it is largely indigenous with smaller contribution from Taiwan. The Proto-Malays such as the Temuan people show genetic evidence of them having moved out of Yunnan, China, thought to be about 4,000–6,000 years ago. The admixture events with South Asians (Indians) may have been ancient (estimate of up to 2,250 years ago in some Indonesian Malays), while the admixture events with East Asians (Chinese) may be more recent (100–200 years ago), although some may have occurred before the 15th century in Java. There are also minor components contributed by other groups such as the Negritos (the earliest inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula), Central Asians and Europeans. Most of the admixture events are estimated to have occurred 175 to 1,500 years ago.\n\nWithin the Malay Peninsula itself, the Malays are differentiated genetically into distinct clusters between the northern part of the Malay Peninsula and the south. SNP analyses of five of their sub-ethnic groups show that Melayu Kelantan and Melayu Kedah (both in northern Malay Peninsula) are closely related to each other as well as to Thai Pattani, but are distinct from Melayu Minang (western), Melayu Jawa and Melayu Bugis (both southern). The Melayu Minang, Melayu Jawa and Melayu Bugis people show close relationship with the people of Indonesia, evidence of their shared common ancestry with these people. However, Melayu Minang are closer genetically to Melayu Kelantan and Melayu Kedah than they are to Melayu Jawa. Among the Melayu Kelantan and Melayu Kedah populations, there are significant Indian components, in particular from the Telugus and Marathis. The Melayu Kedah and Melayu Kelantan also have closer genetic relationship to the two subgroups of the Orang Asli Semang, Jahai and Kensiu, than other Malay groups. Four of the Malay sub-ethnic groups in this study (the exception being Melayu Bugis who are related to the people of Sulawesi) also show genetic similarity to the Proto-Malay Temuan people with possible admixture to the Jawa populations and the Wa people of Yunnan, China.\n\nDeep in the pristine estuary of the Merbok River, lies an abundance of historical relics of the past. Ancient monumental ruins, buildings, temples, harbour and shipwrecks were all cloistered and entombed in the soil for two millenniums. At its zenith, the massive settlement sprawled across a thousand kilometers wide, dominated in the northern plains of Malay Peninsular. On contemporary account, the area is known as the lost city of Sungai Batu. Founded in 535 BC, it is among the oldest testament of civilisation in Southeast Asia and a potential progenitor of the Kedah Tua kingdom.\n\nIt was home to a resplendent society, deeply ingrained with culture, philosophy, religion and trade. The historical landscape of the area was binded to a flourishing iron industry, with archaeological findings unearthed various historical mines, warehouses, factories, a harbour; together with a vibrant plethora of superior-quality ores, furnace, slag and ingots. Additionally, the peculiar Tuyere iron-smelting technique mobilised in Sungai Batu is hailed as oldest of its kind in the world. The produce was highly sought after and exported to various corners of the Old World, including ancient India, China, Middle East, Korea and Japan. Based on early Sanskrit reports, the area was known as \"the iron bowl\".\n\nThe settlement also narrated a glimpse of the ancient religious undertakings prior to the mass Indianisation of the region. The early inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago was chronicled to be the adherence of indigenous animism and shamanism. The ancient folk religion vividly characterised that every elements of nature possessed a spirit, known as \"semangat\". The \"semangat\" has the governing power to richly blessed or mercilessly cursed the society, hence the spirit should always be pleased and entertained. In Sungai Batu, archaeological evidence unmasked several ceremonial and religious architectures devoted for the sun and mountain worshiping.\n\nIn addition to Sungai Batu, the early Malay archipelago also witnessed the monumental development of other subsequent ancient large urban settlements and regional polities, driven by a predominantly cosmopolitan agrarian society, thriving skilled craftsmanship, multinational merchants and foreign expatriates. Chinese records noted the names of Akola, P’an P’an, Tun-Sun, Chieh-ch'a, Ch'ih-tu, among few. Upon the fifth century AD, these settlements had morphed into a sovereign city-states, collectively fashioned by an active participation in the international trade network and hosting diplomatic embassies from China and India.\n\nThere is no definite evidence which dates the first Indian voyages across the Bay of Bengal but conservative estimates place the earliest arrivals on Malay shores at least 2,000 years ago. The discovery of jetty remains, iron smelting sites, and a clay brick monument dating back to 110 CE in the Bujang Valley, shows that a maritime trading route with South Indian Tamil kingdoms was already established since the second century.\n\nThe growth of trade with India brought coastal people in much of maritime Southeast Asia into contact with the major religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Throughout this area a most profound in influence has been exerted by India which seems to have introduced into it architecture, sculpture, writing, monarchy, religion, iron, cotton and a host of elements of higher culture. Indian religions, cultural traditions and Sanskrit began to spread across the land. Hindu temples were built in the Indian style, local kings began referring to themselves as \"raja\" and more desirable aspects of Indian government were adopted.\nThe beginning of the Common Era saw the rise of Malay states in the coastal areas of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra; Chi Tu, Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom, Gangga Negara, Langkasuka, Kedah, Pahang, the Melayu Kingdom and Srivijaya. Between the 7th and 13th centuries, many of these small, often prosperous peninsula and Sumatran maritime trading states, became part of the mandala of Srivijaya, a great confederation of city-states centred in Palembang, Kadaram, Chaiya and Tambralinga.\n\nSrivijaya's influence spread over all the coastal areas of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, western Java and western Borneo, as well as the rest of the Malay Archipelago. Enjoying both Indian and Chinese patronage, its wealth was gained mostly through trade. At its height, the Old Malay language was used as its official language and became the lingua franca of the region, replacing Sanskrit, the language of Hinduism. The Srivijayan era is considered the golden age of Malay culture.\n\nThe glory of Srivijaya however began to wane after the series of raids by the Indian Chola dynasty in the 11th century. By the end of the 13th century, the remnants of the Malay empire in Sumatra was finally destroyed by the Javanese invaders during the Pamalayu expedition (\"Pamalayu\" means \"war against the Malays\").\n\nThe complete destruction of Srivijaya caused the diaspora of the Srivijayan princes and nobles. Rebellions against the Javanese rule ensued and attempts were made by the fleeing Malay princes to revive the empire, which left the area of southern Sumatra in chaos and desolation. In 1299, through the support of the loyal servants of the empire, the Orang lauts, a Malay prince of Srivijaya origin, Sang Nila Utama established the Kingdom of Singapura in Temasek. His dynasty ruled the island kingdom until the end of the 14th century, when the Malay polity once again faced the wrath of Javanese invaders. In 1400, his great great grandson, Parameswara, headed north and established the Malacca Sultanate. The new kingdom succeeded Srivijaya and inherited much of the royal and cultural traditions, including a large part of the territories of its predecessor.\nThe power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the growth of the kingdom of Tambralinga in the 12th century. Between the 13th to early 14th century, the kingdom succeeded to incorporate most of the Malay Peninsula under its mandala. The campaign led by Chandrabhanu Sridhamaraja (1230–1263) managed to capture Jaffna kingdom in Sri Lanka between 1247 and 1258. He was eventually defeated by the forces of the Pandyan dynasty from Tamil Nadu in 1263 and was killed by the brother of Emperor Sadayavarman Sundara Pandyan I. The invasion marked an unrivaled feature in the history of Southeast Asia, it was the only time there was an armed maritime expedition beyond the borders of the region.\n\nThe cultivation of Malay polity system also diffused beyond the proper Sumatran-Peninsular border during this era. The age avowed by exploration and migration of the Malays to establish kingdoms beyond the traditional Srivijayan realm. Several exemplification are the enthronement of a Tambralingan prince to reign the Lavo Kingdom in present-day Central Thailand, the foundation of Rajahnate of Cebu in the Visayas and the establishment of the Tanjungpura Kingdom in what is now West Kalimantan, Borneo. The expansion is also eminent as it shaped the ethnogenesis development of the related Acehnese and Banjar people and further spreading the Indian-influenced Malay ethos within the regional sphere.\n\nThe period of the 12th and 15th centuries saw the arrival of Islam and the rise of the great port-city of Malacca on the southwestern coast of the Malay Peninsula – two major developments that altered the course of Malay history.\n\nThe Islamic faith arrived on the shores of what are now the states of Kedah, Perak, Kelantan and Terengganu, from around the 12th century. The earliest archaeological evidence of Islam from the Malay peninsula is the Terengganu Inscription Stone dating from the 14th century found in Terengganu state, Malaysia.\n\nBy the 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony reached over much of the western Malay Archipelago, had become the centre of Islamisation in the east. As a Malaccan state religion, Islam brought many great transformation into the Malaccan society and culture, and It became the primary instrument in the evolution of a common Malay identity.The Malaccan era witnessed the close association of Islam with Malay society and how it developed into a definitive marker of Malay identity. Over time, this common Malay cultural idiom came to characterise much of the Malay Archipelago through the Malayisation process. The expansion of Malaccan influence through trade and Dawah brought with it together the Classical Malay language, the Islamic faith, and the Malay Muslim culture; the three core values of \"Kemelayuan\" (\"Malayness\").\n\nIn 1511, the Malaccan capital fell into the hands of Portuguese conquistadors. However, Malacca remained an institutional prototype: a paradigm of statecraft and a point of cultural reference for successor states such as Johor Sultanate (1528–present), Perak Sultanate (1528–present), Pahang Sultanate (1470–present), Siak Sri Indrapura Sultanate (1725–1946), Pelalawan Sultanate (1725–1946) and Riau-Lingga Sultanate (1824–1911).\n\nAcross the South China Sea in the 14th century, another Malay realm, the Bruneian Empire was on the rise to become the most powerful polity in Borneo. By the middle of the 15th century, Brunei entered into a close relationship with the Malacca Sultanate. The sultan married a Malaccan princess, adopted Islam as the court religion, and introduced an efficient administration modelled on Malacca. Brunei profited from trade with Malacca but gained even greater prosperity after the great Malay port was conquered by the Portuguese in 1511. It reached its golden age in the mid-16th century when it controlled land as far south as present day Kuching in Sarawak, north towards the Philippine Archipelago. The empire broadened its influence in Luzon by defeating Datu Gambang of the Kingdom of Tondo and by founding a satellite state, Kota Seludong in present-day Manila, setting up the Muslim Rajah, Rajah Sulaiman I as a vassal to the Sultanate of Brunei. Brunei also expanded its influence in Mindanao, Philippines when Sultan Bolkiah married Leila Macanai, the daughter of the Sultan of Sulu. However, states like the Huangdom of Pangasinan, Rajahnate of Cebu and Kedatuan of Madja-as tried to resist Brunei's and Islam's spread into the Philippines. Brunei's fairly loose river based governmental presence in Borneo projected the process of Malayisation. Fine Malay Muslim cultures, including the language, dress and single-family dwelling were introduced to the natives primarily from ethnic Dayaks, drawing them into the Sultanate. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Malay hierarchy, being given the official titles of \"Datuk\", \"Temenggong\" and \"Orang Kaya\". In West Borneo, the development of such sultanates of Sarawak, Sambas, Sukadana and Landak tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.\n\nOther significant Malay sultanates were the Kedah Sultanate (1136–present), Kelantan Sultanate (1411–present), Patani Sultanate (1516–1771), Reman Sultanate (1785–1909) and Legeh Sultanate (1755-1902) that dominated the northern part of the Malay peninsula. Jambi Sultanate (1460–1907), Palembang Sultanate (1550–1823) and Indragiri Sultanate (1298–1945) controlled much of the southeastern shores of Sumatra. While Deli Sultanate (1632–1946), Serdang Sultanate (1728–1948), Langkat Sultanate (1568–1948) and Asahan Sultanate (1630–1948) governed eastern Sumatra.\n\nBetween 1511 and 1984, numerous Malay kingdoms and sultanates fell under direct colonisation or became the protectorates of different foreign powers, from European colonial powers like Portuguese, Dutch and British, to regional powers like Siam and Japan.\nIn 1511, the Portuguese Empire captured the capital city of the Malacca Sultanate. The victorious Portuguese however, were unable to extend their political influence beyond the fort of Malacca. The Sultan maintained his overlordship on the lands outside Malacca and established the Johor Sultanate in 1528 to succeed Malacca. Portuguese Malacca faced several unsuccessful retaliation attacks by Johor until 1614, when the combined forces of Johor and the Dutch Empire, ousted the Portuguese from the peninsula. As per agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch later took control of Malacca.\n\nHistorically, Malay states of the peninsular had a hostile relation with the Siamese. Malacca sultanate herself fought two wars with the Siamese while northern Malay states came intermittently under Siamese dominance for centuries. In 1771, the Kingdom of Siam under the new Chakri Dynasty abolished the Pattani Sultanate and later annexed a large part of Kedah Sultanate. Earlier, the Siamese under Ayutthaya Kingdom have had already absorbed Tambralinga and overrun the Singgora Sultanate in the 17th century. Between 1808-1813, the Siamese imposed a new administrative structure and created the semi-independent Malay kingdoms of Patani, Saiburi, Nongchik, Yaring, Yala, Reman and Rangae from Greater Pattani and similarly obtained Rundung, Kupa, Tongkah, Terang while carving Setul, Langu, Perlis, Kubang Pasu from the Kedah Kingdom in 1839. In 1902, the Siamese stripped the political powers of all the 7 kingdoms of Pattani following a planned revolt for independence against the central government. The coup de grâce was cultivated by 1906, when the Siamese redraw the border of the Pattani territories and installed a new governance and administrative system.\n\nIn 1786, the island of Penang was leased to East India Company by Kedah Sultanate in exchange of military assistance against the Siamese. In 1819, the company also acquired Singapore from Johor Empire, later in 1824, Dutch Malacca from the Dutch, and followed by Dindings from Perak by 1874. All these trading posts officially known as Straits Settlements in 1826 and became the crown colony of British Empire in 1867. British intervention in the affairs of Malay states was formalised in 1895, when Malay rulers accepted British Residents in administration, and the Federated Malay States was formed. In 1909, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis were handed over by Siam to the British. These states along with Johor, later became known as Unfederated Malay States. During the World War II, all these British possessions and protectorates that collectively known as British Malaya were occupied by the Empire of Japan.\n\nThe twilight of the vast Bruneian Empire began during the Castille War against the Spanish conquistadors which arrived at the Philippines from Mexico. The war resulted in the end of the empire's dominance in the present-day Philippine archipelago. The decline further culminated in the 19th century, when the Sultanate lost most of its remaining territories in Borneo to the White Rajahs of Sarawak, North Borneo Chartered Company and its lower Borneo vassals to Dutch East India Company. Brunei was a British protectorate from 1888 to 1984.\n\nFollowing the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 which divided the Malay Archipelago into a British zone in the north and a Dutch zone in the south, all Malay sultanates in Sumatra and Southern Borneo became part of the Dutch East Indies. Though some of Malay sultans maintain their power under Dutch control, some were abolished by the Dutch government under the accusation of retaliation against the colonial rule, like the case of Palembang Sultanate in 1823, Jambi Sultanate in 1906 and Riau Sultanate in 1911.\nA similar partition of the Peninsular was also replicated by the British and the Siamese in wake of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. This was done after the British alarmed by the growing influence between Siamese government and rivaling German colonial empire, especially in the northern Peninsular. The Anglo-Siamese Treaty attested that the Siamese to control the upper portion of the peninsular while the lower region was to be held under the British dominance. The British originally planned for the inclusion of Reman, Legeh and Setul under their dominion together with a cluster of northern Malay states. Nonetheless, they only managed to secure Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis under the agreement. The treaty also witnessed the state of Kedah being reduced the most, with Terutao, Butang islands groups, Sendawa, Langgu and the principality of Setul were all being divorced into the Siamese hands, a similar fate was also followed in northeastern coast of Kelantan that was demanded to renounced their right on the Tabal district, including Sungai Golok and Sungai Padi; while Perlis lost its Pujoh district. Then-British controlled Federated Malay State of Perak however, saw an enlargement of their land area, with southern territories of Reman being transferred into the state. The Siamese then abdicated Tunku Baharuddin, the King of Setul, the sole Malay kingdom remained under Siamese territory in 1916. The treaty nonetheless, manage to sealed the fate of the Malay states of Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu and Perlis to retain a degree of their sovereign powers under the British colonial government, a legacy that can be witnessed today in the Malaysian administrative system.\n\nLater during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya and Borneo, the Japanese maintained a favourable relationship with the Sultans and other Malay leaders, this is partially composed to foster the trust of the Malay public that was generally loyal towards the sultan. Nonetheless, in a series of massacres known as Pontianak incidents, the Japanese assassinated virtually all of the West Kalimantan Malay sultans, including a large numbers of Malay intelligentsias after they have been falsely accused of planning an uprising and coup d'etat against the Japanese. It was believed that West Kalimantan took two generations to recover from the near-total collapse of the Malay ruling class in the territory.\n\nDespite the widespread distribution of the Malay population throughout the Malay archipelago, modern Malay nationalism was only significantly mobilised in the early twentieth century British Malaya i. e. the Malay Peninsula. In the Netherlands Indies, the struggle against colonisation was characterised by the trans-ethnic nationalism: the so-called \"Indonesian National Awakening\" united people from the various parts of the Dutch colony in the development of a national consciousness as \"Indonesians\". In Brunei, despite some attempt made to arouse Malay political consciousness between 1942 and 1945, there was no significant history of ethnic-based nationalism. In Thailand however, Pattani separatism against Thai rule is regarded by some historians as a part of the wider sphere of peninsula Malay nationalism. A similar secession movement can be witnessed in modern-day Indonesia, where both autochthonously-Malay provinces of Riau and Riau Islands sought to gain independence under the name of Republic of Riau. Nevertheless, what follows is specific to the peninsula Malay nationalism that resulted in the formation of the Federation of Malaya, later reconstituted as Malaysia.\n\nThe earliest and most influential instruments of Malay national awakening were the periodicals which politicised the position of the Malays in the face of colonialism and alien immigration of non-Malays. In spite of repressions imposed by the British colonial government, there were no less than 147 journals and newspapers published in Malaya between 1876 and 1941. Among notable periodicals were \"Al-Imam\" (1906), \"Pengasuh\" (1920), \"Majlis\" (1935) and \"Utusan Melayu\" (1939). The rise of Malay nationalism was largely mobilised by three nationalist factions – the radicals distinguishable into the Malay left and the Islamic group which were both opposed to the conservative elites.\nThe Malay leftists were represented by Kesatuan Melayu Muda, formed in 1938 by a group of Malay intelligentsia primarily educated in Sultan Idris Training College, with an ideal of \"Greater Indonesia\". In 1945, they reorganised themselves into a political party known as Partai Kebangsaan Melayu Malaya (PKMM). The Islamists were originally represented by \"Kaum Muda\" consisted of Middle east –educated scholars with Pan-Islamic sentiment. The first Islamic political party was \"Partai Orang Muslimin Malaya\" (Hizbul Muslimin) formed in March 1948, later succeeded by Pan-Malayan Islamic Party in 1951. The third group was the conservatives consisted of the westernised elites who were bureaucrats and members of royal families that shared a common English education mostly at the exclusive Malay College Kuala Kangsar. They formed voluntary organisations known as \"Persatuan Melayu\" ('Malay Associations') in various parts of the country with the primary goals of advancing and protecting the interests of Malays. In March 1946, 41 of these Malay associations formed United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), to assert Malay dominance over Malaya.\n\nThe Malay and Malayness has been the fundamental basis for Malay ideology and Malay nationalism in Malaysia. All three Malay nationalist factions believed in the idea of a \"Bangsa Melayu\" ('Malay Nation') and the position of Malay language, but disagreed over the role of Islam and Malay rulers. The conservatives supported Malay language, Islam and Malay monarchy as constituting the key pillars of Malayness, but within a secular state that restricted the political role of Islam. The leftists concurred with the secular state but wanted to end feudalism, whereas the Islamic group favoured ending royalty but sought a much larger role of Islam.\nSince the foundation of the Republic of Indonesia as a unitary state in 1950, all traditional Malay monarchies in Indonesia were abolished, and the Sultans positions reduced to titular heads or pretenders. The violent demise of the sultanates of Deli, Langkat, Serdang, Asahan and other Malay principalities in East Sumatra during the \"Social revolution\" of 1946, drastically influenced their Malayan counterparts and politically motivating them against the PKMM's ideal of Greater Indonesia and the Islamists' vision of Islamic Republic.\n\nIn March 1946, UMNO emerged with the full support of the Malay sultans from the Conference of Rulers. The new movement forged a close political link between rulers and subjects never before achieved. It generated an excited Malay public opinion which, together with the surprising political apathy of the non-Malays, led to Britain's abandonment of the radical Malayan Union plan. By July, UMNO succeeded in obtaining an agreement with the British to begin negotiations for a new constitution. Negotiations continued from August to November, between British officials on the one hand, and the Sultans' representatives and UMNO and the other.\n\nTwo years later the semi independent Federation of Malaya was born. The new constitutional arrangement largely reverted to the basic pattern of pre-war colonial rule and built on the supremacy of the individual Malay states. Malay rights and privileges were safeguarded. The traditional Malay rulers thus retained their prerogatives, while their English-educated descendants came to occupy positions of authority at the centre, which was being progressively decolonised. In August 1957, the Federation of Malaya, the West's last major dependency in Southeast Asia, attained independence in a peaceful transfer of power. The federation was reconstituted as Malaysia with the addition in 1963 of Singapore (separated in 1965), Sabah and Sarawak.\n\nThe Malay language is one of the major languages of the world and of the Austronesian family. Variants and dialects of Malay are used as an official language in Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. The language is also spoken in Thailand, Cocos Islands, Christmas Island, Sri Lanka. It is spoken natively by approximately 33 million people throughout the Malay Archipelago and is used as a second language by an estimated 220 million.\n\nThe oldest form of Malay is descended from the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language spoken by the earliest Austronesian settlers in Southeast Asia. This form would later evolved into Old Malay when Indian cultures and religions began penetrating the region. Old Malay contained some terms last until today, but remained unintelligible to modern speakers, while the modern language is already largely recognisable in written Classical Malay, which the oldest form dating back to 1303 CE. Malay evolved extensively into Classical Malay through the gradual influx of numerous Arabic and Persian vocabulary, when Islam made its way to the region. Initially, Classical Malay was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the Malay kingdoms of Southeast Asia. One of these dialects that was developed in the literary tradition of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century, eventually became predominant.\n\nThe Malaccan era marked with the transformation of the Malay language into an Islamic language, in similar fashion as the Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Swahili languages. An adapted Arabic script called Jawi was used replacing the Indian script, Islamic religious and cultural terminologies were abundantly assimilated, discarding many Hindu-Buddhist words, and Malay became the language of Islamic medium of instruction and dissemination throughout Southeast Asian region. At the height of Malacca's power in the 15th century, the Classical Malay spread beyond the traditional Malay speaking world and resulted in a \"lingua franca\" that was called \"Bahasa Melayu pasar\" (\"Bazaar Malay\") or \"Bahasa Melayu rendah\" (\"Low Malay\") as opposed to the \"Bahasa Melayu tinggi\" (\"High Malay\") of Malacca. It is generally believed that Bazaar Malay was a pidgin and the most important development, however, has been that pidgin creolised, creating several new languages such as the Ambonese Malay, Manado Malay and Betawi language.\n\nEuropean writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Tavernier, Thomassin and Werndly describe Malay as \"language of the learned in all the Indies, like Latin in Europe\". It is also the most widely used during British and Dutch colonial era in the Malay Archipelago. The reversed was seen in the Spanish East Indies, where mass latinisation of the archipelago during the colonial years resulted the historical coup de grâce of the Malay language in the Philippines.\n\nThe dialect of Johor Sultanate, the direct successor of Malacca, became the standard speech among Malays in Singapore and Malaysia, and it formed the original basis for the standardised Indonesian language.\n\nApart from the standard Malay, developed within the Malacca-Johor sphere, various local Malay dialects exist. For example, the Bangkanese, the Bruneian, the Jambian, the Kelantanese, the Kedahan, the Negeri Sembilanese, the Palembangnese, the Pattanese, the Sarawakian, the Terengganuan, and many others.\n\nThe Malay language was historically written in Pallawa, Kawi and Rencong. After the arrival of Islam, Arabic-based Jawi script was adopted and is still in use today as one of the two official scripts in Brunei and as an alternative script in Malaysia. Beginning from the 17th century, as a result of British and Dutch colonisation, Jawi was gradually replaced by the Latin-based Rumi script and eventually became the official modern script for Malay language in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, and co-official script in Brunei.\n\nThe rich oral literature and classical literature of the Malays contain a great number of portraits of the people, from the servant to the minister, from the judge to the Rajas, from the ancient to the very contemporary periods, which together form the amorphous identity of the Malays.\n\nConsidering the softness and mellifluence of the Malay language, which lends itself easily to the requirements of rhyme and rhythm, the originality and beauty in Malay literature can be assessed in its poetical elements. Among the forms of poetry in Malay literature are – the Pantun, Syair and Gurindam.\nThe earliest form of Malay literature was the oral literature and its central subjects are traditional folklore relating to nature, animals and people. The folklore were memorised and passed from one generation of storytellers to the next. Many of these tales were also written down by \"penglipur lara\" (storytellers) for example: \"Hikayat Malim Dewa\", \"Hikayat Malim Deman\", \"Hikayat Raja Donan\", \"Hikayat Anggun Cik Tunggal\", and \"Hikayat Awang Sulung Merah Muda\".\n\nWhen Indian influences made their way to the Malay Archipelago around 2000 years ago, Malay literature began incorporating Indian elements. Literature of this time is mostly translations of Sanskrit literature and romances, or at least some productions inspired by such, and is full of allusions to Hindu mythology. Probably to this early time may be traced such works as \"Hikayat Seri Rama\" (a free translation of the \"Ramayana\"), \"Hikayat Bayan Budiman\" (an adaptation of Śukasaptati) and \"Hikayat Panca Tanderan\" (an adaptation of \"Hitopadesha\").\n\nThe era of classical Malay literature started after the arrival of Islam and the invention of Jawi script (Arabic based Malay script). Since then, Islamic beliefs and concepts began to make its mark on Malay literature. The Terengganu Inscription Stone, which is dated to 1303, is the earliest known narrative Malay writing. The stone is inscribed with an account of history, law, and romance in Jawi script. At its height, the Malacca Sultanate was not only the center of Islamisation, but also the center of Malay cultural expressions including literature. During this era, notable Middle Eastern literary works were translated and religious books were written in Malay language. Among famous translated works are \"Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah\" and \"Hikayat Amir Hamzah\".\n\nThe rise of Malay literature during the period was also penned by other homegrown literary composition coloured by mystical Sufism of the middle-east, the notable works of Hamzah Fansuri such as \"Asrar al-Arifin\" (\"Rahsia Orang yang Bijaksana;\" The Secret of the Wise), \"Sharab al-Asyikin\" (\"Minuman Segala Orang yang Berahi;\" The Drink of All the Passionate) and \"Zinat al-Muwahidin\" (\"Perhiasan Sekalian Orang yang Mengesakan;\" The Ornament of All the Devoted) can be seen as the magna opera of the era.\n\nThe most important piece of Malay literary works is perhaps the famed Malay Annals or Sulalatus Salatin. It was called \"the most famous, distinctive and best of all Malay literary works\" by one of the most prominent scholars in Malay studies, Sir Richard O. Winstedt. The exact date of its composition and the identity of its original author are uncertain, but under the order of Sultan Alauddin Riaayat Shah III of Johor in 1612, Tun Sri Lanang oversaw the editorial and compilation process of the Malay Annals.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Malay literature received some notable additions, including \"Kitab Ilmu Bedil\" (Book of Traditional Weaponry) that provides valuable details of traditional Malay ammunition and weaponry. The era also witnessed the wider usage of Malay medical journals, known as \"Kitab Tib\". These works are indeed important as it serve as references to the Malay knowledge and technology during the classical era.<ref name=\"MOWCAP, The Memory of the World Committee for Asia/Pacific 2017\"></ref>\n\nThe same century also witnessed a monumental shift in the Malay literature through writings of Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, a famous Malacca-born munshi of Singapore. Abdullah is regarded as the most cultured Malay who ever wrote, one of the greatest innovators in Malay letters and the father of modern Malay literature. His most important works are the \"Hikayat Abdullah\" (an autobiography), \"Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Kelantan\" (an account of his trip for the government to Kelantan), and \"Kisah Pelayaran Abdullah ke Mekah\" (a narrative of his pilgrimage to Mecca 1854). His work was an inspiration to future generations of writers and marks an early stage in the transition from classical Malay literature to modern Malay literature.\n\nThe early Malay communities were largely animists, believing in the existence of \"semangat\" (spirits) in everything. Around the opening of the common era, Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced by South Asian traders to the Malay Archipelago, where they flourished until the 13th century, just before the arrival of Islam brought by Arab, South Asian and Chinese Muslim traders.\n\nIn the 15th century, Islam of the orthodox Sunni sect flourished in the Malay world under the Malacca Sultanate. In contrast with Hinduism, which transformed early Malay society only superficially, Islam can be said to have really taken root in the hearts and minds of the Malays. Since this era, the Malays have traditionally had a close identification with Islam and they have not changed their religion since. This identity is so strong that it is said to become Muslim was to \"masuk Melayu\" (to enter Malayness).\n\nNevertheless, the earlier beliefs having deeper roots, they have maintained themselves against the anathemas of Islam – and indeed Sufism or the mysticism of Shia Islam have become intertwined among the Malays, with the spirits of the earlier animistic world and some elements of Hinduism. Following the 1970s, Islamic revival (also referred as re-Islamisation) throughout the Muslim world, many traditions that contravene the teaching of Islam and contain elements of shirk were abandoned by the Malays. Among these traditions was the \"mandi safar\" festival (Safar bath), a bathing festival to achieve spiritual purity, in which can be discerned features similar to some of those of the Durga Puja of India.\n\nA vast majority of modern ethnic Malays are the adherents of Sunni Islam and the most important Malay festivals are those of Islamic origin - \"Hari Raya Aidilfitri\", \"Hari Raya Aidiladha\", \"Awal Muharram\", and \"Maulidur Rasul\". It is considered \"apostasy\" for Malays to convert out of Islam in Malaysia and Brunei. However, a few ethnic Malays living outside of these countries have also embraced other religions.\n\nVarious cultural influences, notably Chinese, Indian and Europeans, played a major role in forming Malay architecture. Until recent time, wood was the principal material used for all Malay traditional buildings. However, numerous stone structures were also discovered particularly the religious complexes from the time of Srivijaya and ancient isthmian Malay kingdoms.\n\nCandi Muara Takus and Candi Muaro Jambi in Sumatra are among the examples that associated with the architectural elements of Srivijaya Empire. However, the most of Srivijayan architecture was represented at Chaiya (now a province in Thailand) in Malay peninsular, which was without doubt a very important centre during the Srivijaya period. The type of structure consists of a cell-chamber to house the Buddha image and the summit of structure was erected in the form of \"stupa\" with successive, superimposed terraces which is the best example at \"Wat Pra Borom That\" of Chaiya.\n\nThere is also evidence of Hindu shrines or \"Candi\" around south Kedah between the mount Jerai and the Muda River valley, an area known as Bujang Valley. Within an area of about 350 square kilometres, 87 early historic religious sites have been reported and there are 12 \"candis\" located on mountain tops, a feature which suggests may derive from pre-historic Malay beliefs regarding sanctity of high places.\nEarly reference on Malay architecture in Malay peninsula can be found in several Chinese records. A 7th-century Chinese account tells of Buddhist pilgrims calling at Langkasuka and mentioned the city as being surrounded by a wall on which towers had been built and was approached through double gates. Another 7th-century account of a special Chinese envoy to Red Earth Kingdom in Malay peninsular, recorded that the capital city had three gates more than hundred paces apart, which were decorated with paintings of Buddhist themes and female spirits.\n\nThe first detailed description of Malay architecture was on the great wooden \"Istana\" of Mansur Shah of Malacca (reigned 1458–1477). According to Sejarah Melayu, the building had a raised seven bay structures on wooden pillars with a seven tiered roof in cooper shingles and decorated with gilded spires and Chinese glass mirrors.\n\nThe traditional Malay houses are built using simple timber-frame structure. They have pitched roofs, porches in the front, high ceilings, many openings on the walls for ventilation, and are often embellished with elaborate wood carvings. The beauty and quality of Malay wood carvings were meant to serve as visual indicators of the social rank and status of the owners themselves.\n\nThroughout many decades, the traditional Malay architecture has been influenced by Bugis and Java from the south, Siamese, British, Arab and Indian from the north, Portuguese, Dutch, Aceh and Minangkabau from the west and Southern Chinese from the east.\n\nWood carving is a part of classical Malay visual arts. The Malays had traditionally adorned their monuments, boats, weapons, tombs, musical instrument, and utensils by motives of flora, calligraphy, geometry and cosmic feature. The art is done by partially removing the wood using sharp tools and following specific patterns, composition and orders. The art form, known as \"ukir\", is hailed as an act of devotion of the craftsmen to the creator and a gift to his fellowmen.\n\nThe art form is mainly attributed to the abundance of timber on the Malay Archipelago and also by the skillfulness of the woodcarvers that have allowed the Malays to practice woodcarving as a craft. The natural tropical settings where flora and fauna and cosmic forces is abundant has inspired the motives to be depict in abstract or styled form into the timber board. With the coming of Islam, geometric and Islamic calligraphy form were introduced in the wood carving. The woods used are typically from tropical hardwood species which is known to be durable and can resist the attacks of the fungi, power-boots beetles and termites.\n\nA typical Malay traditional houses or mosque would have been adorned with more than 20 carved components. The carving on the walls and the panels allow the air breeze to circulate effectively in and out of the building and can let the sunlight to light the interior of the structure. At the same time, the shadow cast by the panels would also create a shadow based on the motives adding the beauty on the floor. Thus, the carved components performed in both functional and aesthetic purposes.\n\nUnder the Malay culture, pottery is not solely witnessed as a mere household utensil. It is perceived as a work of art, a paradigm of talent, embroidered with aesthetic, legacy, perseverance and religious devotion. The Malay earthen is usually unglazed, with the ornamental designs were carved when the pottery is semi-dried during its construction process.\n\nAccording to several studies, the native Malay pottery industry has developed indigenously from the period of great antiquity and has since encapsulates a high-level of culture sophistication. It also has been noted that the design features of the Malay pottery suggested the absence of the foreign influence prior to the 19th century, a paradox considering the vast cultural contact between the Malays and the outside world.\n\nAmong the renowned traditional Malay pottery includes \"Mambong\" of Kelantan, molded from clay and identified with the colour of terracotta. It is usually assumed the form as cooking utensils. In the west coast, the raven-coloured \"Labu Sayung\" of Kuala Kangsar is honourned for gourd-formed jars. There are also several variants of \"Labu\", including \"Labu Tela, Labu Kepala, Labu Gelugor Tela\" and \"Labu Gelugor Kepala\".\n\nOther forms of Malay traditional pottery are: The \"Belanga\", commonly in a wide rim and a round base, the pot usually mobilised to cook curries. It is held that the structure of the earthen would aid the heat to be evenly distributed, correlating to its round base. A smaller version of the \"Belanga\" is called \"periok\", used for rice-preparation; The \"Buyong\", commonly defined by a straight collar and a spherical body, oftentime used as a water jar; The \"Terenang\", the angular \"Terenang\" is used as a canister, especially in the coastal Malay regions of Kelantan, Pattani and Terengganu; The \"Bekas Bara\", a small container, usually crafted for the use of incense; The \"Jambangan\", a traditional Malay vase, usually for aesthetic purposes and \"Geluk\", a small water storage.\n\nDifferent Malay regions are all known for their unique or signature dishes – Pattani, Kelantan and Terengganu for their \"Nasi dagang\", \"Nasi kerabu\" and \"Keropok lekor\"; Jambi, Pahang, and Perak for their Durian-based cuisine especially \"gulai tempoyak\"; South Sumatra, Kedah, and Penang for their northern-style \"Asam laksa\" and \"rojak\"; Perlis and Satun for their \"Bunga kuda\" desserts; Negeri Sembilan for its lemak-based dishes, West Sumatra, Riau, Melaka, and Johor for their spicy \"Asam Pedas\"; Riau and Pahang for their \"ikan patin\" (Pangasius fish) dishes; Melayu Deli of Medan, North Sumatra for their \"Nasi goreng teri Medan\" (Medan anchovy fried rice) and \"Gulai Ketam\" (crab gulai); Jambi for its \"Panggang Ikan Mas\"; Palembang for its \"Mie celor\" and \"Pempek\"; Sarawak and Sambas for their \"Bubur pedas\" and \"laksa\"; Brunei for its unique \"Ambuyat\" and \"Nasi Katok\" dish.\n\nThe main characteristic in traditional Malay cuisine is undoubtedly the generous use of spices. The coconut milk is also important in giving the Malay dishes their rich, creamy character. The other foundation is \"belacan\" (shrimp paste), which is used as a base for \"sambal\", a rich sauce or condiment made from belacan, chillies, onions and garlic. Malay cooking also makes plentiful use of lemongrass and galangal.\n\nNearly every Malay meal is served with rice, the staple food in many other East Asian cultures. Although there are various type of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. Food is eaten delicately with the fingers of right hand, never with the left which is used for personal ablutions, and Malays rarely use utensils. Because most of Malay people are Muslims, Malay cuisine follows Islamic halal dietary law rigorously. Protein intake are mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, and lamb meat, and also includes poultry and fishes. Pork and any non-halal meats, also alcohol is prohibited and absent from Malay daily diet.\n\nNasi lemak, rice cooked in rich coconut milk probably is the most popular dish ubiquitous in Malay town and villages. Nasi lemak is considered as Malaysia's national dish.\n\nAnother example is Ketupat or \"nasi himpit\", glutinous compressed rice cooked in palm leafes, is popular especially during \"Idul Fitri\" or \"Hari Raya\" or Eid ul-Fitr. Various meats and vegetables could be made into Gulai or Kari, a type of curry dish with variations of spices mixtures that clearly display Indian influence already adopted by Malay people since ancient times. Laksa, a hybrid of Malay and Peranakan Chinese cuisine is also a popular dish. Malay cuisine also adopted some their neighbours' cuisine traditions, such as rendang adopted from the Minangkabaus in Pagaruyung Highlands, and satay from Java, however Malay people has developed their own distinctive taste and recipes.\n\nThe Malays have diverse kinds of music and dance which are fusions of different cultural influences. Typical genres range from traditional Malay folk dances dramas like Mak Yong to the Arab-influenced Zapin dances. Choreographed movements also vary from simple steps and tunes in Dikir barat to the complicated moves in Joget Gamelan.\n\nTraditional Malay music is basically percussive. Various kinds of gongs provide the beat for many dances. There are also drums of various sizes, ranging from the large \"rebana ubi\" used to punctuate important events to the small \"jingled-rebana\" (frame drum) used as an accompaniment to vocal recitations in religious ceremonies.\n\nNobat music became part of the Royal Regalia of Malay courts since the arrival of Islam in the 12th century and only performed in important court ceremonies. Its orchestra includes the sacred and highly revered instruments of \"nehara\" (kettledrums), \"gendang\" (double-headed drums), \"nafiri\" (trumpet), \"serunai\" (oboe), and sometimes a knobbed gong and a pair of cymbals.\n\nIndian influences are strong in a traditional shadow play known as Wayang Kulit where stories from Hindu epics; Ramayana & Mahabharata form the main repertoire. There are four distinctive types of shadow puppet theatre that can be found in Malay peninsula; \"Wayang Gedek\", \"Wayang Purwa\", \"Wayang Melayu\" and \"Wayang Siam\". Nonetheless, the art and the storytelling of \"Wayang Purwa\" and \"Wayang Siam\" denote a regional influence in fused with the Javanese and Siamese respectively, while \"Wayang Melayu\" and \"Wayang Gedek\" narrated a more autochthonously Malay form and fashion.\n\nOther well-known Malay performing arts are; \"Bangsawan\" theatre, \"Dondang Sayang\" love ballad and \"Mak Inang\" dance from Malacca Sultanate, \"Jikey\" and \"Mek Mulung\" theatre from Kedah, \"Asyik\" dance and \"Menora\" dance drama from Patani and Kelantan, \"Ulek mayang\" and \"Rodat\" dance from Terengganu, \"Boria\" theatre from Penang, \"Canggung\" dance from Perlis, \"Mukun\" warble from Brunei and Sarawak, Gending Sriwijaya from Palembang,\"Serampang Dua Belas\" dance from Serdang. and Zapin Api firedance from Riau.\n\nThe traditional Malay apparel and textile has been continuously morphed since the time of antiquity. Historically, the ancient Malays were chronicled to incorporate various natural materials as a vital source for fabrics, clothing and attire. The common era however, witnessing the early arrivals the merchants from east and west to the harbours of Malay archipelago, together they bought new luxurious items, including fine cotton and silks. The garments subsequently become a source of high Malay fashion and acquired a cultural role as the binding identity in the archipelago, especially in the Peninsula, Sumatra and the coastal areas of Borneo.\n\nIn Malay culture, clothes and textiles are revered as symbols of beauty, power and status. Numerous accounts in Malay hikayats stressed the special place occupied by textiles. The Malay handloom industry can be traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under Song dynasty. Mention of locally made textiles as well as the predominance of weaving in Malay peninsular was made in various Chinese and Arab accounts. Among well-known Malay textiles are Songket, Batik, \"Telepok\", \"Limar\", \"Tenun\", \"Kelingkam\", \"Cindai\" and \"Tekad\".\n\nClassical Malay dress varies between different regions, but the most profound traditional dress in modern-day are Baju Kurung (for women) and Baju Melayu (for men), which both recognised as the national dress for Malaysia and Brunei, and also worn by Malay communities in Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar and Thailand.\nThe word \"Baju Kurung\", literary defined as \"encase the body\" of the wearer is tailored based on the Islamic principles of modesty, decency and humility. The practice is parallel to the Judaeo-Christian religious doctrine, as flaunting the intimate body parts is considered as forbidden in Islam. The interpretation was then absorbed to the Malay way of dressing and cultural perspective, this can be strongly witnessed upon the rule of Mansur Shah of Malacca in the 15th century, the sultan prohibited his female muslim subjects in the public from wearing only a sarong from the bust downwards. Throughout the ages, The Malay Baju Kurung went into several reincarnation before assuming its current form. Due to the vastness of various Malay kingdoms in the archipelago, local and distinct forms of the Baju Kurung design patterns can also be witnessed in the region, including Bengkulu, Kedah, Jambi, Johor-Riau, Pahang and Palembang. \n\nThe corresponding mode of Baju Kurung for men is known as \"Baju Melayu\". The upper part of the garment was made with the geometrical design almost similar with Baju Kurung and commonly paired with woven cloth known as the sarong. The pattern of the sarong may possessed a symbol of the person's marital status or the rank in the classical Malay society.\n\nOther common classical Malay attire for men consists of a \"baju\" (shirt) or \"tekua\" (a type of a long sleeve shirt), \"baju rompi\" (vest), \"kancing\" (button), a small leg \"celana\" (trousers), a sarong worn around the waist, \"capal\" (sandal), and a \"tanjak\" or \"tengkolok\" (headgear); for the aristocrats, the \"baju sikap\" or \"baju layang\" (a type of coat) and \"pending\" (ornamental belt buckle) are also synonymous to be worn as a formal attire. It was also common for a \"pendekar\" (Malay warrior) to have a Kris tucked into the front fold of sarong.\n\nIn contrast to Baju Melayu which continued to be worn as ceremonial dress only, Baju Kurung is worn daily throughout the year by a majority of Malay women. Sighting of female civil servants, professional workers and students wearing Baju Kurung is common in Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nThe rise of Islam managed to redefine the Malay identity by the 15th century. Thus, resulting most of the Malay festivals and celebrations to run parallel with the Islamic calendar, albeit deeply ingrained with a strong sense of Malay character. The biannual Hari Raya (lit \"the Great Day\") observance of Aildifitri and Aidiladha are hailed as the grand celebrations universally across the Malay community. The two holidays are instrumental to commentate two major events and philosophy in the Islamic teaching and beliefs. The former signifies the triumph as a Muslim after a month of fasting and patience in Ramadan, while the latter is to observe the sacrifice made by Ibrahim (Abraham) under the name of Allah.\n\nThe Raya holidays usually commenced during the homecoming event known as Balik Kampung which occurred a few days before the festival. During the Hari Raya, the Malays would celebrated by holding a grand feast and visiting friends, relatives and neighbours. A visit to the grave of the departed loved ones is also essential, as a sign of respect, love and honour.\nOther major religious ceremonies celebrated by the Malays include Ramadhan, a month-long holy month devoted by daytime fasting and various religious activities; Maulidur Rasul, a special grand procession to honour the birth of Prophet Muhammad; Ashura, remembrance of Muharram where the Malays would solemnly prepared a special dish, known as \"Bubur Ashura\"; Nisfu Syaaban, the Mid-Sha'ban observance, a special day of fasting for forgiveness; Nuzul Quran, the first the revelation of the Quran; Israk dan Mikraj, the ascension Prophet Muhammed to the heavens and Awal Muharram, the Islamic New Year; the latter three celebrations are usually observed by holding a special \"sunat\" prayers, religious lectures and Islamic discussions in the mosque.\n\nThere are also a plethora of domestic regional cultural festivals within different the Malay spheres. The coastal areas were historically known to observed the \"Mandi Safar\" or \"Puja Pantai\" ceremony, a purifying bath during the Islamic month of Safar, originally emulated from the ancient pre-Islamic Malay holy cleansing rituals; and \"Pesta Menuai\", a harvest festival celebrated by the inland and agrarian Malay communities by traditional games, theatre, Joget and other repertoire of dance-play. However, both of the practice is gradually extinct owing from various social and economic revolution engineered in the Malay community in the 20th century. Additionally, many Malays are also known to participate in the imperial celebrations to honour the royal courts of their respective kingdoms.\n\nThe Islamic features also strongly embroidered the Malay celebrations in the individual level, a juxtaposition bonded to the spiritual rite of passage as a Muslim. The Malays would usually organised \"kenduri\", a religious ceremonial banquet to celebrate or to seek blessing for an event. There are several philosophical variations of kenduri, raging from \"Doa Selamat\" (asking for divine favour and protection), \"Kesyukuran\" (for thanksgiving and gratitude), \"Aqiqah\" and \"Cukur Jambul\" (newborn ceremony, for celebrating a new life), \"Khatam\" (a graduation ceremony, after a child's first full-reading of the Quran), \"Khatan\" (circumcision), \"Kahwin\" (wedding), \"Arwah\" or \"Tahlil\" (prayers for a deceased person), among few. The event is usually organised by the family and was traditionally aided by the community in a social gathering known as \"Rewang\". In \"Rewang\", the whole family would be assisted by their neighbours and relatives, delegating various tasks raging from food preparations, venue management, logistic assembly and other technical control. Nevertheless, following the rise of urbanism in the contemporary Malay community, the practice of \"Rewang\" is gradually superseded by hired-caterer services by the family.\n\nSilat and its variants can be found throughout the Malay world: the Malay peninsula (including Singapore), the Riau Islands, Sumatra and coastal areas of Borneo. Archaeological evidence reveals that, by the 6th century, formalised combat arts were being practised in the Malay peninsular and Sumatra. The earliest forms of Silat are believed to have been developed and used in the armed forces of the ancient Malay kingdoms of Langkasuka (2nd century) and Srivijaya (7th century).\n\nThe influence of the Malay sultanates of Malacca, Johor, Pattani and Brunei has contributed to the spread of this martial art in the Malay Archipelago. Through a complex maze of sea channels and river capillaries that facilitated exchange and trade throughout the region, Silat wound its way into the dense rainforest and up into the mountains. The legendary Laksamana Hang Tuah of Malacca is one of the most renowned \"pesilat\" (Silat practitioners) in history and even considered by some as the father of Malay silat. Since the classical era, Silat Melayu underwent great diversification and formed what is today traditionally recognised as the source of Indonesian Pencak Silat and other forms of Silat in Southeast Asia.\n\nApart from Silat, Tomoi is also practised by Malays, mainly in the northern region of the Malay peninsula. It is a variant of Indo-Chinese forms of kickboxing which is believed to have been spread in the Southeast Asian mainland since the time of Funan Empire (68 AD).\n\nIn the Malay society, classical metalworks assumed a role more than a mere instrumental tool. It serves as a testament of culture, cultivated by artistic appreciation and religious symbol, molded by a craftsman who possessed a talent to redefined the essence of nature in the most ornamental manner. The artform has indeed received a long existence in the Malay World, observations made by the Arabs on the courts of Srivijaya narrated that about the abundance of golds in the capital, till the extend that the bars have to be ceremonially thrown into the estuary in a daily basis. On the Chinese accounts, the area was occasionally hailed as \"Jinzou\", the gold coast. The zenith of Srivijaya also witnessed the arrivals of silver bought by the foreign merchants, which then spread to the members of Malay aristocracy.\n\nUpon the turn of 17th century, gold, silver, iron and brass have all been perfectly molded to become part and parcel to the Malay society. The era witnessed the works of metal received a critical royal patronage. A plethora of Malay metalworks manifested as evidence of this era, raging from a peculiar Malay dagger known as Keris made of iron, down to the elaborate fine jewellery made from the splendor of gold and silver. For the Malay nobles during this period, the works of pending (ornamental Belt buckle embellished with precious stones), \"keronsang\" (brooch) and \"cucuk sanggul\" (hairpins) were staged to become among the most sought item of fashion. The era also hosted a number of other prominent items in the Malay regalia cast in gold, including ceremonial box, \"Tepak sirih\" (Betel container) and parts of Keris. The art of casting gold were predominantly done by repoussé and granulation techniques, in which the traditional methods can still be witnessed until today. In the contemporary era, the Malay gold jewels are mainly found in the form of anklets, bracelets, rings, necklaces, pendants and earrings.\n\nFor the Malay silverware, the works of silver are fairly known for its sophisticated and fine designs. It is usually crafted in the form of repousse, filigree and neillowork. Among the common traditional Malay items usually made of silver includes pillow ends, belt buckles, matt corners, stoppers for water vessels, Keris sheaths and tobacco boxes. The \"Awan Larat\" (cloud patterns) and \"Kerawang\" (Vegetal motives) are among the popular designs for Malay decorative silver pillow ends and tobacco boxes.\n\nThe usage of brassware transcends a plethora of classical Malay social classes, being used by the members of nobility and commoners alike. The popularity of brassware is heavily contributed due to its durability, quality and affordability to all. The brassware can be narrowed into two distinctions, yellow brass for functional items and white for decorative purposes. It is often meticulously hammered and craved with various decorative designs in religious and floral motives. The usage of brass however, is best known for Tepak Sireh, a ceremonial tray for betel quid and for constructing certain musical instruments such as Gongs for the classical Malay Gamelan orchestra. Additionally, other prominent traditional Malay items made from metal includes flower vases, perfume sprinkles, serving trays, cooking pots, kettle and incense burners.\n\nThe Keris is one of the most revered items of Malay weaponry. Originally developed by the Javanese down south, the armament gradually assumed a Malay identity after entering the Srivijayan court, giving rise to characteristics distinct from its Javanese Keris forebears. By the time of Malacca in 15th century, the evolution of the Malay Keris was perfected and possession of a Keris came to be regarded as part-and-parcel of Malay culture, becoming a philosophical symbol, juxtapositioned in prestige, craftsmanship, masculinity and honour.\n\nDuring the classical era, a Malay man was not be seen without a Keris outside of his house. The absence of a Keris on a man was frowned upon, perceived as if he were parading naked to the public. Traditionally, a man of Malay extraction would own three types of Keris: \"Keris Pusaka\" (the Dynasty Keris, inherited from one generation to another), \"Keris Pangkat\" (the Status Keris, awarded in right of his position in Malay society) and \"Keris Perjuangan Dirinya\" (the Struggle Keris, literally defined as his personal Keris). There are many strict rules, regulations and taboos to be adhered to in owning a Keris. The blade of a Kris is usually coated in a venomous arsenic, thus crafting an excruciatingly lethal blade for its prey. Traditionally, each Keris is also regarded as possessing a spirit, known as \"semangat\", Special rituals were to be conducted to nurture, preserve and guardthe \"soul\" of the weapon. The spiritual approach is usually held every \"Malam Jumaat\" (Thursday night), with the blade is being purified with lime and smoked with incense, dedicated prayers and devoted mantras would be also recited upon to compliment the mystic ritual.\nThe Malays and Javanese are abided by contrasting philosophical values pertaining to Keris-wearing. Traditionally, a Malay would embedded his Keris from the front, an honour that the weapon is more paramount compared to the wearer and a constant reminder that one is always equipped to combat the nemesis. The Javanese however, adhered to the principle that he should be more cautious and the Keris may solely be exercised during the time of need, thus cladding their Keris from behind. The Javanese also believed that by mobilising their weapon that position, it would confused the enemy.\n\nParadoxically, both groups shared a similar ideology addressing the hilt of the Keris. If the hilt faced up front, it serves as a testament that the man is prepared for a fight. Nevertheless, if the hilt is turned behind, it is an oath that the person is embracing for a reconciliation.\n\nThere are also a plethora of other forms of weaponry in the Malay arsenal, all were nevertheless equally revered in a correlating manner as the Keris. The Malays would classified the traditional weapons under 7 different structures: \"Tuju\" (\"Direct\", the large and heavy artillery, including the Malay cannons of \"Meriam\", \"Ekor Lontong\", \"Lela\" and \"Rentaka\"), \"Bidik\" (\"Gun\", a weapon with metal tube propelled by an ammunition, with the Malay forms of \"Terakor\" and \"Istingar\"), \"Setubuh\" (\"A body\", weapon in the similar dimension of a human body, referred to the Malay spears of \"Tongkat Panjang\" and \"Lembing\"), \"Selengan\" (\"An arm\", a large saber from the length of the shoulders to the tips of the fingers, constituting the Malay saber of \"Pedang\" and \"Sundang\"), \"Setangan\" (\"A hand\", a sword with the diameter measured from the elbow to the 3 fingers, including \"Badik Panjang\" and \"Tekpi\"), \"Sepegang\" (\"A hold\", smaller than the \"Setangan\", a dagger with \"Keris\" and \"Badik\" in the category) and \"Segenggam\" (\"A grab\", the smallest in the category, the hand-sized blade, including \"Lawi Ayam\", \"Kerambit\", \"Kuku Macan\" and \"Kapak Binjai\"). Other items in the traditional Malay weaponry includes \"sumpit\" (Blowpipe) and \"Busur dan Panah\" (Bow and Arrow), which are distinct from the seven class of armaments. Additionally, the Malays also would deploy \"Zirah\", a type of \"Baju Besi\" (armour) and \"Perisai\" (shield) as defense mechanisms during the armed conflict.\n\nTraditional Malay games usually require craft skills and manual dexterity and can be traced their origins since the days of Malacca Sultanate. \"Sepak Raga\" and kite flying are among traditional games that were mentioned in the Malay Annals being played by nobilities and royalties of the Malay sultanate.\n\n\"Sepak Raga\" is one of the most popular Malay games and has been played for centuries. Traditionally, Sepak raga was played in circle by kicking and keeps aloft the rattan ball using any part of the body except the arms and hands. It is now recognised as Malaysia's national sport and played in the international sporting events such as Asian Games and Southeast Asian Games.\nOther popular game is \"Gasing\" spinning which usually played after the harvest season. A great skill of craftsmanship is required to produce the most competitive \"Gasing\" (top), some of which spin for two hours at a time.\n\nPossibly the most popular Malay games is the \"Wau\" (a unique kind of kite from east coast of Malay peninsular) or kite flying. Wau-flying competitions take place with judges awarding points for craftsmanship (\"Wau\" are beautiful, colourful objects set on bamboo frames), sound (all Malay kites are designed to create a specific sound as they are buffeted about in the wind) and altitude.\n\nThe Malays also have a variant of Mancala board game known as Congkak. The game is played by moving stones, marbles, beads or shells around a wooden board consisting of twelve or more holes. Mancala is acknowledged as the oldest game in the world and can be traced its origin since Ancient Egypt.\nAs the game dispersed around the globe, every culture has invented its own variation including the Malays.\n\nMalay personal names are complex, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society, and titles are considered important. It has undergone tremendous change, evolving with the times to reflect the different influences that the Malays been subjected over the ages. Although some Malay names still retain parts of its indigenous Malay and Sanskrit influences, as Muslims, Malays have long favoured Arabic names as marks of their religion.\n\nMalay names are patronymic and can be consisted of up to four parts; a title, a given name, the family name, and a description of the individual's male parentage. Some given names and father's names can be composed of double names and even triple names, therefore generating a longer name. For example, one of the Malaysian national footballer has the full name Mohd Zaquan Adha Abdul Radzak, where 'Mohd Zaquan Adha' is his triple given name and 'Abdul Radzak' is his father's double given name.\n\nIn addition to naming system, the Malay language also has a complex system of titles and honorifics, which are still extensively used in Malaysia and Brunei. By applying these Malay titles to a normal Malay name, a more complex name is produced. The former Prime Minister of Malaysia has the full name Dato' Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, where 'Dato' Seri' is a Malay title of honour, 'Mohd Najib' is his personal name, 'bin' is derived from an Arabic word Ibnu meaning \"son of\" if in case of daughter it is replaced with binti, an Arabic word \"bintun\" meaning \"daughter of\", introduces his father's titles and names, 'Tun' is a higher honour, 'Haji' denotes his father's Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, and 'Abdul Razak' is his father's personal name.\nThe more extremely complex Malay names however, belong to the Malay royalties. The reigning Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia has the full regnal name Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Muhammad V lbni Sultan lsmail Petra, while the reigning Sultan of Brunei officially known as Kebawah Duli Yang Maha Mulia Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar 'Ali Saifuddien Sa'adul Khairi Waddien.\n\n\n"}

This ethnic group along with other indigenous people such as the Illanun people, Sakai people, Jakun people, Senoi and Semang, are the ethnic groups that formed the existing Acehnese people today. The Mante people are regarded as part of the Proto-Malay people group that initially settled around the region of Aceh Besar Regency and in the interior jungle. These indigenous people were thought to have migrated to Aceh through the Malay peninsula. In the Acehnese legend, the Batak and Mante people were mentioned as the descendants of Kawom Lhèë Reutōïh (meaning, \"the Three Hundred people\"); which were also one of the indigenous peoples in Aceh, Indonesia. Today, this people are extinct or have disappeared as a result of intermarriage with other non-indigenous people groups that arrived later. To date, there are still no strong scientific evidence for the existence of this people.\n\nIn March 2017, there were video recordings by a group of bikers in Aceh who accidentally saw and recorded a man that was thought to be a Mante tribe. The alleged Mante man at the site was caught by surprise and ran away immediately; and the scene was recorded by one of the bikers in the group. The video recording was uploaded on YouTube and quickly became a viral topic of discussion on social medias and in the news in Indonesia.\n\nThe spread of the news gained the attention of the Aceh government to dispatch a search team to find the Mante people and examine their real existence.

{"id": "38250354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38250354", "title": "Multi-dimensional model of Maori identity and cultural engagement", "text": "Multi-dimensional model of Maori identity and cultural engagement\n\nThe multi-dimensional model of Māori identity and cultural engagement (MMM-ICE) is a self-report (Likert-type) questionnaire designed to assess seven distinct dimensions of identity and cultural engagement in Māori populations: group-membership evaluation, socio-political consciousness, cultural efficacy and active identity engagement, spirituality, interdependent self-concept, authenticity of beliefs, and perceived appearance.\n\nThe MMM-ICE is a quantitative index of identity that can be readily compared across independent studies of the Māori people. The index was developed by Drs Carla Houkamau and Chris Sibley in 2010; both of whom are senior lecturers at The University of Auckland. The scale was updated in 2014 as the MMM-ICE2 to incorporate the seventh measure of perceived appearance. The MMM-ICE2 aims to provide a culturally sensitive, valid, and reliable measure of Māori identity: \"who\" a person is as Māori, how they \"fit in\" with others socially, and what that means in terms of behaviour. The MMM-ICE is associated with the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study.\n\n\"Group membership evaluation\" reflects the basic premise of social identity theory that individuals strive for favourable evaluations of their group. The more positively one's group is perceived, the greater the positive evaluations individuals can draw from when interpreting themselves. Having a negative sense of self as Māori has group members internalise the negative evaluations into their own self-concept. Since social identities are not only descriptive but also evaluative, the position of one's group within social hierarchy is viewed as central to the self-experience of individual members.\n\nSample items in this dimension include:\n\n\"Socio-political consciousness\" reflects how active an individual is in promoting and defending Māori rights given the context of the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nIssues include support for (or lack thereof) a Māori political party, resource allocation and reparation for the Māori based on historical injustice, and issues relating to the symbolic representation of Māori culture. A high score on this scale reflects the belief that Māori individuals need to remain loyal to the group and stay politically unified. For example, individuals who score high on this scale are more supportive of the Māori Party (a political party in New Zealand that represents the Māori), and least supportive of the New Zealand National Party (the mainstream centre-right political party currently in power). A low score on this scale reflects the belief that Māori people should operate independently and that Māori–Pākehā (non-Māori New Zealanders) historical relations are irrelevant for understanding contemporary ways of \"being\" Māori. Those who score low on this scale will generally endorse the dominant ideological positions, political attitudes, and intergroup attitudes of white New Zealanders.\n\nSample items include:\n\n\"Cultural efficacy and active identity engagement\" measures the extent to which the individual perceives they have the personal resources required to engage appropriately with other Māori in Māori social and cultural contexts. These personal resources include the ability to speak and understand Te Reo Māori, knowledge of Tikanga Māori and Marae etiquette, and the ability to articulate heritage confidently (e.g., recite whakapapa).\nA high score on this scale would reflect that an individual is comfortable and feels accepted when among other Māori or in situations which require the active expression of Māori traditional knowledge (such as participating in powhiri and tangihanga).\n\nSample items include:\n\n\"Spirituality\" measures engagement with, and belief in, certain Māori spiritual concepts. This relates primarily to feeling a strong connection with ancestors, Māori traditions, the sensation and experience of waahi tapu (sacred places), and a strong spiritual attachment and feeling of connectedness with the land.\n\nSample items include:\n\n\"Interdependent self-concept\" measures the extent to which the concept of the self-as-Māori is defined by virtue of relationships with other Māori people, rather than being defined solely as a unique and independent individual. Māori are more likely to experience self-conceptualization in terms of important relationships. This is manifested by a tendency for individuals to see their identity as inherently linked to relationships with others. The MMM-ICE interdependent self-concept scale also relates to the concept of the independent versus interdependent self that has emerged in cross-cultural psychology. This link suggests that the concept of self for many Māori people may be inherently linked or embedded in a collective identity.\n\nSample items include:\n\n\"Authenticity beliefs\" measures the extent to which the individual believes that to be a \"real\" Māori, one must display specific (stereotypical) features, knowledge, and behaviour, as opposed to the belief that Māori identity is fluid rather than fixed and is produced through experience.\n\nA high score on this scale therefore represents a rigid and inflexible construction of the characteristics that determine an \"authentic\" Māori identity. This relates to various (often Pākehā-constructed) definitions of Māori \"race\", such as blood quantum or appearance.\n\nSample items include:\n\n\"Perceived appearance\" measures the extent to which people subjectively evaluate their physical appearance as exhibiting features that signals their ethnicity as Māori.\n\nSample items include:\n\nHoukamau and Sibley proposed the MMM-ICE be used as an instrument for answering the question, \"What does 'being Māori' mean?\"\n\nIn 2014, they examined how those who identified solely as Māori versus those who identified partially differed in terms of a range of psychological and economic outcomes. They found that those who identified as having mixed Māori and European ancestry reported significantly higher satisfaction with their standard of living, personal health, future security, and the economic situation in New Zealand. Identifying with a mixed ancestry was also associated with having political views closer to those of white New Zealanders, such as supporting the New Zealand National Party. Those who identified solely as Māori showed increased support for the Māori Party, and were more supportive of bicultural policies.\n\nIn 2015, Houkamau and Sibley found that self-reported measures of one's appearance as Māori significantly predicted decreased rates of home ownership. This effect held even when adjusting for numerous demographic covariates.\n\n"}

The community are thus manufacturers of mustard or sesame oil. In North India, the community speaks Urdu, and its dialects, Awadhi and Khari Boli. In Pakistan, the community speak Punjabi. They were among a number of artisan communities, that were converted to Islam.\nThe Muslim Teli of Punjab claim descent from a Baba Hasu, who is said to have invented the kolhu or oil press. According to their traditions, their ancestor Luqman was apprenticed to the King David. Luqman attempted extract oil, but failed until taught by an old woman who suggested mixing water with the oil press. After Luqman came Baba Budhu, and after him Mina and Baba Jasu or Baba Hasu, who was ancestor of the Punjab Telis.\n\nIn India, they are found throughout North India, with concentrations in the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The community depend on land. Their traditional occupation of oil pressing has now been replaced with the growing of cash crops and business. Many are now successful businessmen. The commuynity perceives itself to be of Shaikh status, as they are converts from Vaish community.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, a majority of Teli are small and medium-sized farmers. Many have benefited from land reforms carried out at Indian Independence, when they were granted ownership of the land they cultivated. The Uttar Pradesh Teli are strictly endogamous, and are further divided into four endogamous groups, the Turkiya, Ikasna, Doasna and Dese. In terms of distribution, the Turkiya are found mainly in Awadh and Varanasi, while the Ikasna and Doasna are found in western Uttar Pradesh. They speak Urdu, as well as dialects of Hindi, and follow the Sunni sect. The Teli live in multi-caste villages, and but occupy their own distinct quarters. .\n\nIn Delhi, the Teli are sub-divided into two communities, the Teli proper and the Teli Dhuniya. They live in the neighbourhoods of Phatak Teliya, Phatak Habash Khan, Khirwala Phatak and Borhaiya in Old Delhi. The Delhi Teli are also known as Shaikh Mansuri, and this name has replaced Teli as a self-description. They are now a community of small businessman and traders, although many are still engaged in oil pressing. A good many of the Delhi Teli emigrated to Pakistan, at partition, and now found concentrated in Karachi.\n\nIn Bihar, the Muslim Teli (malik) call themselves Turk Teli or Turkia. According to their traditions, the community is descended of Turk soldiers in the armies of Bakhtiyar Khilji, the Muslim conqueror of Bihar. They are found throughout Bihar, and speak Bhojpuri. Like Teli elsewhere, many are now small and medium-sized businessmen, and have been more successful than other Muslim artisans castes in their adoption of the modern market economy.\n\nIn Haryana, the Muslim Teli, who are also known as Malik, are found throughout the state, and speak Haryanvi. They are divided along sectarian divisions, with the majority being Sunni and a minority Shia. The community is further divided into three endogamous groups, the Ikasna, Doasna and Asne. These three sub-divisions are further divided into clans or gotras, such as the Olyan, Diyya and Panwar. But the Muslim Teli practice clan exogamy, and there is a further restriction on not marrying within the village. Although Muslim, the Teli do practice a number of Hindu customs, but these are in decline. The community has abandoned its traditional occupation of oil pressing, with a small number now being cultivators. A majority however are agricultural labourers, with other others employed in the construction industry in Delhi. Like other Haryana Muslims, they were affected by the partition of India, which the departure almost half the community to Pakistan.\n\nThe Teli have traditional communities councils, but they also have a formal communities association, the Mansuri Anjuman. Their traditional communities councils or panchayats are sub-divided into circles, made up of 10 to 20 villages.\n\nIn India, they are found throughout South West India, the Marwari Teli are found in the province of Rajasthan with concentrations in the Districts of Chohtan Town Barmer, Fateh Pur- Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Amersar Jaipur [(etc.)]. There are many gotras that are a part of Muslim Marwari Teli community in India. They subdivide in Aagwan, Anan, Barguzar Bagdari, Bajya, Barra, Barjatya, Banthiya, Bhati, Bhindsara, Chadodiya, Changal, Chandija, Chandred, Chouhan, Dahiya, Dayma, Devbandiya, Dunga, Fanan, Gehlot, Gorad, Gouri, Jajam, Rao, Jatu, Jidran, Khatri, Joya, Kayat, Khilji, Khichi, Khokar, Kuchava, Kuladiya, Lagga, Malnas, Mast, Mohal, Mugal, Munga, Nirban, Upadhya, Shukla, Oswal, poswal, Pawar, Rathore, Sahad, Sankhla, sigard, Solanki, Sulda, Tanwar, Unhe, Tigala, Rana.\n\nIn Pakistan, there are three distinct communities which form part of the Teli community, the Shaikh Mansoori, who are an Urdu speaking community based in Karachi, and the \nTeli Malik and \nTeli Rajput...of Punjab.\n\nIn Pakistan, they are found throughout South East Pakistan, the Marwari Teli are found in the province of Sindh (Pakistan) with concentrations in the Districts of Mirpurkhas Town Mirpurkhas, Chachro Town Mithi, Shahpur Chakar Sanghar, Hyderabad, Karachi . There are many gotras that are a part of Muslim Marwari Teli community in Pakistan. They subdivide in Chaki / Solankhi / Solanki, Ghori, Chail / Chohan, Chandel / Soomrah, Panwar, Khilji and Sahu, Phanan,\n\nIn Pakistan, the Malik Awan Teli is a found in the province of Punjab. Although awan caste totally different from malik teli caste.Teli malik are still largely a rural community. The community has very small land scale and some are living as landless. Major changes, however have occurred in the cities of central Punjab, such as Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Sialkot and Gujranwala. The urban Teli have started small industries such as power looms, The Teli Malik of Faisalabad have been a particularly successful community.\n\nThere are many gotras that are a part of Muslim teli community in Pakistan. They subdivide in 'ikasna' and 'doasna' meaning having one profession and two professions respectively. Other profession adopted by Muslim teli is of cotton ginning to make comforters (blankets filled with cotton) they are therefore known as doasna. All rajput and jat gotras in Muslim teli community are doasna teli.\nOther gotras in teli community are rathor, khokar, chauhan, bargujar, tanwar, gehlot, dahiya, panwar, sikarwar and more.\nIn Gujranwala. Sialkot (Narowal), Gurdaspur (Shakargarh) district teli are descendant of Rajpoots who have adopted this profession after the freedom fight of 1857. Rajpoot clans of teli are Taheem or Theeme (in Narowal & Shakargarh), Malik Awan, Tarrar, Khokhar, Jailat (gehlot), Waddhar, Bhatti and more...They are mostly settled in Multan, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Sargodha, Rawalpindi and Mandi Bahaudin districts.(10)\n\nIn addition to the Punjabi Teli, the Shaikh Mansoori Teli community, originating from the city of Delhi, are found in Karachi. They are an Urdu speaking community, and from one of the sub-groups of the Muhajir community of Sindh.\n\n"}

It derives from Sanskrit terms \"pri\" (before) and \"bhumi\" (earth).\n\nFollowing independence, the term was normally used to distinguish indigenous Indonesians from citizens of foreign descent (especially Chinese Indonesians). Common usage distinguished between \"pri\" and \"non-pri\". Although the term is sometimes translated as \"indigenous\", it has a broader meaning than that associated with Indigenous peoples.\n\nThe term WNI keturunan asing (WNI = \"Indonesian citizen\", \"keturunan asing\" = foreign descent), sometimes just \"WNI keturunan\" or even \"WNI\", has also been used to designate \"non-pri\" Indonesians.\n\nIn practice, usage of the term is fluid. \"Pri\" is seldom used to refer to Indonesians of Melanesian descent, although it does not exclude them. Indonesians of Arab descent sometimes refer to themselves as \"pri\". Indonesians with some exogenous ancestry who show no obvious signs of identification with that ancestry (such as former President Abdurrahman Wahid who is said to have had Chinese ancestry) are seldom called \"non-pri\". The term bumiputra is sometimes used in Indonesia with the same meaning as \"pribumi\", but is more commonly used in Malaysia, where it has a slightly different meaning.\n\nThe term \"putra daerah\" (\"son of the region\") refers to a person who is indigenous to a specific locality or region. \n\nIn 1998, the Indonesian government of President B.J. Habibie instructed that neither \"pri\" nor \"non-pri\" should be used, on the grounds that they promoted ethnic discrimination.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company, which dominated parts of the archipelago from the 17th century, classified its subjects mainly by religion, rather than ethnicity. The colonial administration which took power in 1815 at shifted to a system of ethnic classification. Initially they distinguished between Europeans (\"Europeanen\") and those equated with them (including native Christians) and \"Inlanders\" and those equated with them (including non-Christian Asians).\n\nOver time, native Christians were gradually shifted de facto into the \"Inlander\" category, while Chinese Indonesians, Arab Indonesians and others of non-Indonesian descent were gradually given separate status as \"Vreemde Oosterlingen\" (\"Foreign Orientals\"). The system was patriarchal, rather than formally racial. A child inherited his/her father's ethnicity if the parents were married; the mother's ethnicity if they were unmarried. The off-spring of a marriage between a European man and an Indonesian women were legally European.\n\nThe colonial system was similar to the casta system in Hispanic America, or the South African apartheid system, which prohibited inter-racial neighborhoods (\"wet van wijkenstelsel\") and inter-racial interactions were limited by \"passenstelsel\" laws.\n\nThe outbreak of the World War II saw the fall of colonial state of Dutch East Indies. During Japanese occupation, the Dutch colonials were put into the lowest class of social strata. Native blood was the only thing that could free Indos (mixed Eurasian ancenstry) from being put into concentration camps. The following Indonesian Revolution (1945-1949) saw the rise of Indonesian Republic, subsequently the revolution has brought a drastic social changes. The Dutch colonials and the Indos are suspiciously considered by republicans as Dutch loyalist, thus they are not a desired element in the newly established republic. By 1950s, large numbers of Dutch colonials and Indos were being repatriated to the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the revolution, the natives majority has gained the political, social and economic power previously reserved only for Dutch colonials. In post colonial Indonesia, the Chinese Indonesians are the most significant minority group that being categorized as \"non-pribumi\" (non native).\n\nToday, Indonesian dictionary describes \"pribumi\" as \"penghuni asli\" which translated into \"original, native or indigenous inhabitant\".\n\nPribumi make up about 95% of the Indonesian population. Using Indonesia’s population estimate in 2006, this translates to about 230 million people. As an umbrella of similar cultural heritage among various ethnic groups in Indonesia, Pribumi culture plays a significant role in shaping the country’s socioeconomic circumstance.\n\nThe United States Library of Congress Country Study of Indonesia defines \"Pribumi\" as:\nThere are over 300 ethnic groups in Indonesia. 200 of those are of Native Indonesian ancestry.\n\nThe largest ethnic group in Indonesia are the Javanese people who make up 41% of the total population. The Javanese are concentrated on the island of Java but millions have migrated to other islands throughout the archipelago. The Sundanese, Malay, and Madurese are the next largest groups in the country. Many ethnic groups, particularly in Kalimantan and the province of Papua, have only hundreds of members. Most of the local languages belong to the Austronesian language family, although a significant number, particularly in Papua, speak Papuan languages.\n\nThe division and classification of ethnic groups in Indonesia is not rigid and in some cases are unclear as the result of migrations, along with cultural and linguistic influences; for example some may agree that the Bantenese and Cirebonese belong to different ethnic groups with their own distinct dialect, however others might consider them to be Javanese sub-ethnicities, as members of the larger Javanese people. The same considerations may apply to the Baduy people who share so many similarities with the Sundanese people that they can be considered as belonging to the same ethnic group. The clearest example of hybrid ethnicity are the Betawi people, the result of a mixture of different native ethnicities that have merged with people of Arab, Chinese and Indian origins since the era of colonial Batavia (Jakarta).\nThe proportional populations of Native Indonesians according to the (2009 census) is as follows:\n\nThe skin color of native Indonesians ranges from fair skin with yellowish undertone to light brown to very dark brown or black skin color. Archaeologist Peter Bellwood claims that the \"vast majority\" of people in Indonesia and Malaysia, the region he calls the \"clinal Mongoloid-Australoid zone\", are \"Southern Mongoloids\" but have a \"high degree\" of Australoid admixture.\n\n\"Sawo matang\" (lit. \"ripe sapodilla\") usually refers to the skin colour of the Pribumis in Indonesia which connotes \"mid light to dark tone brown\" especially for those who live in Java, Bali, Sumatra, etc. For other places like in Borneo, Sulawesi, and eastern parts of Indonesia, native people tend to have darker skin colour who actually come from the east of Indonesia and for those who live in high altitude areas and highlands tend to have lighter skin colour like people from Sundanese, Manado, Tomohon, Dayak, etc. For islandic people, they tend to have dark skin colour which all of the physical characteristics depend on the geographical areas they inhabit.\n\nMost Native Indonesians are genetically close to Asians while the more eastern one goes the more people show Melanesian affinity. Geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza claims that there is a genetic division between East and Southeast Asians. In a similar manner, Zhou Jixu agrees that there is a physical difference between these two populations. Other geneticists have found evidence for four separate populations, carrying distinct sets of non-recombining Y chromosome lineages, within the traditional Mongoloid category: North Asians, Han Chinese, Japanese and Southeast Asians. The complexity of genetic data has led to doubt about the usefulness of the concept of a Mongoloid race itself, since distinctive East Asian features may represent separate lineages and arise from environmental adaptations or retention of common proto-Eurasian ancestral characteristics.\n\nThe regions of Indonesia have some of their \"indigenous\" ethnic groups. Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government transmigration programs or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions.\n\n\nNon-Pribumi Indonesians:\n\n"}

The novel is a report of Ijon Tichy's travel to a faraway planet Entia (in Polish text: Encja) to study their civilization. This report was supposed to fix a misunderstanding arisen from Tichy's Fourteenth Voyage to supposedly Entia (then known as Enteropia), which turned out to be a satellite of Entia, masqueraded by Entians to misguide explorers. The travel was also to verify the results of the \"Institute of Historiographical Computers\" (Polish: Instytut Maszyn Dziejowych), which use predictive modeling to overcome the speed of light limitation and get information about the state of the affairs on remote planets based on information obtained from previous expeditions.\n\nMajor themes of the book are: the problems of the society of abundance based entirely on automated production where individuals have little to do; imposition of ethical laws through technology i.e. the \"ethicsphere\" which has made it impossible to harm individuals physically; and the ideological opposition of two dominant systems, which is basically a parody of Western World-Soviet Union split taken to the absurd.\n\nThe original novel was first printed by Wydawnictwo Literackie in 1982. It was translated into German by Hubert Schumann under the title \"Lokaltermin\" in 1987 ().\n\nLacking English translation, the novel title was also translated in literary criticism works as \"Eyewitness Account\" and \"The Scene of the Crime\".\n\n\"Science Fiction Studies\" published a collection of excerpts from Lem's letters which show the chronology of the creation of the novel (during 1979-1981.\n\nTichy arrives on Entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states: Kurdlandia (from \"kurdl\") and Luzania. These names require some explanations.\n\n\"Kurdl\" is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of Entia. The name of the animal is Lem's invention, used in earlier tales about Tichy. (In Polish it is \"kurdel\", however in declensions of the word the root converts into \"kurdl-\", hence there are no associations with the English word \"curdle\"). The name \"Luzania\" derives from the Polish root \"luz-\" with the meaning of \"loose\", \"not restrained\"; the choice will become clear below.\n\nKurdlandia's guiding ideology is \"national mobilism\", that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the stomachs, various passages and internal organs of the kurdls. Kurdls walk about the marshes, guided by drivers, and their inhabitants hence are \"able to explore the land of their wonderful country from inside of their home kurdl\", in the words of a patriotic individual that Ijon Tichy spoke to. Inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically (at least for 24 hours a year). Exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes, on dry ground, in normal houses. Kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it.\n\nThe other state, Luzania, constitutes the most significant treatment of the topic of an \"ideal state\" in Lem (and many would argue, in all science fiction). Their most prominent accomplishment is the creation of \"ethicsphere\" (compare \"atmosphere\"). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called \"bystry\" (\"quickies\" in English) that serve to control matter in the 'quickated' areas. The primary function of the 'quickies' is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word ethicsphere). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non-physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the 'quickies' would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet.\n\nThe 'quickies' also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living. Hence, there is not much of an economic life going on, although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs. Many Luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits, such as being professors, students, and government officials, but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent. Apparently the 'quickies' are capable of some collective thought, at least for the purposes of self-replication and self-improvement, as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals (no small feat, no doubt). The artists of Luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that 'quickies' can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can; naturally, many of them are members of the protest movement.\n\nThere exists ideological opposition between the collectivist Kurdlandia and the generally libertarian Luzania. Generally speaking, many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border. On the other hand, many Luzanians, especially university students and faculty, dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the 'quickies' and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl-ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the 'quickies', depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual. Luzanians also enjoy traveling to Kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the 'quickies' areas.\n\nThe main character spends most of his time in Luzania, studying the history of the world and the current Luzanian social system. We learn about it through his words.\n"}

{"id": "1626400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1626400", "title": "Radium Girls", "text": "Radium Girls\n\nThe Radium Girls were female factory workers who contracted radiation poisoning from painting watch dials with self-luminous paint. Painting was done by women at three different sites in the United States, and the term now applies to the women working at the facilities: the first, a United States Radium factory in Orange, New Jersey, beginning around 1917; the facility at Ottawa, Illinois, beginning in the early 1920s; and a third facility in Waterbury, Connecticut.\n\nThe women in each facility had been told the paint was harmless, and subsequently ingested deadly amounts of radium after being instructed to \"point\" their brushes on their lips in order to give them a fine point; some also painted their fingernails, face and teeth with the glowing substance. The women were instructed to point their brushes because using rags, or a water rinse, caused them to waste too much time and waste too much of the material made from powdered radium, gum arabic and water.\n\nFive of the women in New Jersey challenged their employer in a case over the right of individual workers who contract occupational diseases to sue their employers under New Jersey's occupational injuries law, which at the time had a two-year statute of limitations, but settled out of court in 1928. Five women in Illinois who were employees of the Radium Dial Company (which was unaffiliated with the United States Radium Corporation) sued their employer under Illinois law, winning damages in 1938.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1926, U.S. Radium Corporation, originally called the Radium Luminous Material Corporation, was engaged in the extraction and purification of radium from carnotite ore to produce luminous paints, which were marketed under the brand name \"Undark\". The ore was mined from the Paradox Valley in Colorado and other \"Undark mines\" in Utah. As a defense contractor, U.S. Radium was a major supplier of radioluminescent watches to the military. Their plant in Orange, New Jersey, employed over one hundred workers, mainly women, to paint radium-lit watch faces and instruments, misleading them that it was safe.\n\nThe U.S. Radium Corporation hired approximately 70 women to perform various tasks including handling radium, while the owners and the scientists familiar with the effects of radium carefully avoided any exposure to it themselves; chemists at the plant used lead screens, masks and tongs. U.S. Radium had distributed literature to the medical community describing the \"injurious effects\" of radium. In spite of this knowledge, a number of similar deaths had occurred by 1925, including the company's chief chemist, Dr. Edwin E. Leman, and several female workers. The similar circumstances of their deaths prompted investigations to be undertaken by Dr. Harrison Martland, County Physician of Newark.\n\nAn estimated 4,000 workers were hired by corporations in the U.S. and Canada to paint watch faces with radium.\nAt USRC, each of the painters mixed her own paint in small crucibles, and then used camel hair brushes to apply the glowing paint onto dials. The then-current rate of pay, for painting 250 dials a day, was about a penny and a half per dial (). The brushes would lose shape after a few strokes, so the U.S. Radium supervisors encouraged their workers to point the brushes with their lips (\"lip, dip, paint\"), or use their tongues to keep them sharp. Because the true nature of the radium had been kept from them, the Radium Girls painted their nails, teeth, and faces for fun with the deadly paint produced at the factory. Many of the workers became sick; it is unknown how many died from exposure to radiation.\n\nMany of the women later began to suffer from anemia, bone fractures and necrosis of the jaw, a condition now known as radium jaw. It is thought that the X-ray machines used by the medical investigators may have contributed to some of the sickened workers' ill-health by subjecting them to additional radiation. It turned out at least one of the examinations was a ruse, part of a campaign of disinformation started by the defense contractor. U.S. Radium and other watch-dial companies rejected claims that the afflicted workers were suffering from exposure to radium. For some time, doctors, dentists, and researchers complied with requests from the companies not to release their data. At the urging of the companies, worker deaths were attributed by medical professionals to other causes; syphilis, a notorious sexually transmitted infection at the time, was often cited in attempts to smear the reputations of the women.\n\nThe inventor of radium dial paint, Dr Sabin A. Von Sochocky, died in November 1928, becoming the 16th known victim of poisoning by radium dial paint. He had gotten sick from radium in his hands, not the jaw, however the circumstances of his death helped the Radium Girls in court.\n\nThe Radium Dial Company was established in Ottawa, Illinois, in 1922, in the town's former high school. Like the United States Radium Corporation, the purpose of the studio in Ottawa was to paint dials for clocks, their largest client being Westclox Corporation in Peru, Illinois. Dials painted in Ottawa appeared on Westclox's popular Big Ben, Little Ben and travel clocks; and like United States Radium Corporation, Radium Dial hired young women to paint the dials, using the same \"lip, dip, paint\" approach as the women in New Jersey and by another unaffiliated plant in Waterbury, Connecticut, that supplied the Waterbury Clock Company.\n\nFollowing the termination of President Joseph Kelly from the concern, Kelly established a competing firm in the town named Luminous Process Company, which also employed women in the same fashion, and in the conditions as the other firms. Employees at Radium Dial began showing signs of radium poisoning in 1926-1927, and were unaware of the hearings and trials in New Jersey. Furthermore, Radium Dial leadership authorized physicals and other tests designed to determine the toxicity of its employees, but the company never turned those records to the employees or told them of the results. In a half-hearted attempt to end the use of the camel hair brushes, management introduced glass pens with a fine point; however, the workers found that the pens slowed down their productivity (they were paid by the piece), and they reverted to using brushes. When word of the New Jersey women and their suits appeared in local newspapers, the women were told that the radium was safe, and that employees in New Jersey were showing signs of viral infections. Assured by their employers that the radium was safe, they returned to work as usual.\n\nIn New Jersey, the story of the abuse perpetrated against the workers is distinguished from most such cases by the fact that the ensuing litigation was covered widely by the media. Plant worker Grace Fryer decided to sue, but it took two years for her to find a lawyer willing to take on U.S. Radium. Even after the women found a lawyer, the slow-moving courts held out for months. At their first appearance in court on January 1928, two women were bedridden and none of them could raise their arms to take an oath. A total of five factory workers – Grace Fryer, Edna Hussman, Katherine Schaub, and sisters Quinta McDonald and Albina Larice – dubbed the Radium Girls, joined the suit. The litigation and media sensation surrounding the case established legal precedents and triggered the enactment of regulations governing labor safety standards, including a baseline of \"provable suffering\".\n\nIn Illinois, employees began asking for compensation for their medical and dental bills as early as 1927, but were refused by management. The demand for money by sick and dying former employees continued into the mid 1930s before a suit before the Illinois Industrial Commission (IIC) was brought. In 1937 five women found an attorney by the name of Leonard Grossman, that would represent them in front of the commission, but by this time, Radium Dial had closed, moving to New York. The IIC did retain a $10,000 deposit left by Radium Dial when it disclosed to the IIC that they could not find any insurance to cover the cost of indemnifying the company against employee suits. In the spring of 1938, the IIC ruled in favor of the women. The attorney representing the interests of Radium Dial appealed hoping to get the verdict overturned, and again the commission judge found for the women. Radium Dial appealed over and over, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court and on October 23, 1939, the court decided not to hear the appeal and the lower ruling was upheld. In the end, this case had been won eight times before Radium Dial was finally forced to pay.\n\nThe Radium Girls' saga holds an important place in the history of both the field of health physics and the labor rights movement. The right of individual workers to sue for damages from corporations due to labor abuse was established as a result of the Radium Girls case. In the wake of the case, industrial safety standards were demonstrably enhanced for many decades.\n\nThe case was settled in the autumn of 1928, before the trial was deliberated by the jury, and the settlement for each of the Radium Girls was $10,000 () and a $600 per year annuity plus $12 a week for all of their lives () while they lived, and all medical and legal expenses incurred would also be paid by the company.\n\nThe lawsuit and resulting publicity was a factor in the establishment of occupational disease labor law. Radium dial painters were instructed in proper safety precautions and provided with protective gear; in particular, they no longer shaped paint brushes by lip and avoided ingesting or breathing the paint. Radium paint was still used in dials as late as the 1960s.\n\nRobley D. Evans made the first measurements of exhaled radon and radium excretion from a former dial painter in 1933. At MIT he gathered dependable body content measurements from 27 dial painters. This information was used in 1941 by the National Bureau of Standards to establish the tolerance level for radium of 0.1 μCi (3.7 kBq).\n\nThe Center for Human Radiobiology was established at Argonne National Laboratory in 1968. The primary purpose of the Center was providing medical examinations for living dial painters. The project also focused on collection of information and, in some cases, tissue samples from the radium dial painters. When the project ended in 1993, detailed information of 2,403 cases had been collected. This led to a book on the effects of radium on humans. The book suggests that radium-228 exposure is more harmful to health than exposure to radium-226. Radium-228 is more able to cause cancer of the bone as the shorter half life of the radon-220 product compared to radon-222 causes the daughter nuclides of radium-228 to deliver a greater dose of alpha radiation to the bones. It also considers the induction of a range of different forms of cancer as a result of internal exposure to radium and its daughter nuclides. The book used data from radium dial painters, people who were exposed as a result of the use of radium-containing medical products, and other groups of people who have been exposed to radium.\n\n\n\n"}

The first woman to be hanged in four decades in Central New York, her botched execution resulted in the decision to replace the gallows with the electric chair in 1890.\n\nMrs. Druse murdered her husband, William Druse, in their home in Warren, New York. The murder unfolded with the help of her son and daughter, George and Mary Druse, and nephew Frank Gates. The family members were threatened with death if they refused and therefore, they all had an involvement with the murder case as a whole. Druse claimed that her motive was that her husband was abusive to her and was not supporting the family because he had left for a number of days after an argument. Frank Gates and George Druse were later released due to lack of involvement of the murder. During the trial, Mary Druse admitted to assisting in the murder, and was sentenced to life at the Onondaga Country penitentiary. On October 6, 1885 Roxalana was sentenced to be hanged on November 25, 1885 but, due to multiple changes, this was changed to a final, official date of February 28, 1887.\n\nOn December 18th, 1884, in the morning before the murder, the Druse couple had a fight. Fights were common between the Druses, and many residents reported signs of foul play. The couple were known in the community for their arguments and disagreements (which the Defense later presented to the jury to convince them that Mr. Druse was in fact abusive to his wife). During this dispute, Roxalana concealed a revolver under her apron which was placed by her in another room. Upon instruction from his mother, George Druse, aged ten, left the house while sister and daughter of the couple Mary Druse, aged nineteen, remained in the house.\n\nMary then tied a rope around her father's neck while Mrs. Druse fired the revolver wounding Mr. Druse. Due to misuse of the weapon, Roxalana forced fourteen-year-old nephew Frank Gates to further fire at her husband. After pleading for help and unable to move, Mr. Druse was decapitated by his wife wielding an axe. The body, along with the head, were then taken into the parlor, where they remained for the day. There, Mrs. Druse cut up her husband’s body and burnt it to ash on a stove. She also burned William’s clothes to further destroy evidence and erase his traces from the house. False documents were produced which read that Mr. Druse had left the house after an argument and his whereabouts were unknown. In order to further the idea that William disappeared, Roxalana threatened that she would kill her daughter and the boys, (who were playing checkers), if they admitted to the crime. The ashes were dumped in a nearby swamp, while the murder weapon and revolver were wrapped up and dumped in a pond.\n\nOn December 18, 1884, William Druse was reported missing by the police due to his sudden disappearance. Investigation lead to finding the murder weapon, an axe sold previously to William Druse, wrapped in paper in a pond along with the revolver. Multiple allegations were reported against wife Roxalana, yet due to lack of evidence, nothing was officially reported. On January 16, 1885, Frank Gates admitted to the crime after consistent harassment from neighbors. Gates and Mrs. Druse were then arrested and brought to trial on September 21, 1885, which lasted nearly two weeks.\n\nWhen Druse was sentenced to death in Herkimer County, New York, suspension hanging was the method of execution. The process jerked the prisoner upwards by a weighted rope instead of the body dropping downwards through a trap door. But as Druse was a small woman, the force failed to break her neck leaving her to die agonizingly by strangulation. The scene was so upsetting, officials decided to switch the primary method of execution in the state to the electric chair. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "5482306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5482306", "title": "Stella Matutina", "text": "Stella Matutina\n\nThe Stella Matutina (Morning Star) was an initiatory magical order dedicated to the dissemination of the traditional teachings of the earlier Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Originally, the outer order of the Stella Matutina was known as \"Mystic Rose\" or \"Order of the M.R. in the Outer\". Notably, when occult author Israel Regardie released the documents of the Golden Dawn to the general public for the first time, it was not the teachings of the original order, but those of the Stella Matutina that he revealed. The Stella Matutina was one of several daughter organisations into which the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn fragmented, including the Alpha et Omega led by John William Brodie-Innes and Macgregor Mathers, the Isis-Urania Temple led by A.E. Waite, and others.\n\nAfter a revolt of London Adepts against the then-head of the Order (Samuel MacGregor Mathers) in early 1900, the Order segmented into two new groups. Those who remained loyal to Mathers took on the name Alpha et Omega, while the London group took on the name Hermetic Society of the Morgenrothe. The latter group retained such members as Robert Felkin (a British doctor), John William Brodie-Innes, A.E. Waite, Rev. Ayton, W.B. Yeats and others.\n\nThe Morgenrothe had a very short existence before it, too, schismed into two groups. Those who were most interested in Christian Mysticism (led by A.E. Waite) took over the remnants of Isis-Urania, and formed the Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn, and later the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross. Those from the Morgerothe who were more interested in occultism (led by Dr. Felkin) formed the group \"Stella Matutina\"- naming their Mother Temple \"Amoun.\"\n\nThe outer order was changed by Dr. Felkin and other members of the Golden Dawn based in London. Among others who helped form Stella Matutina was J.W. Brodie-Innes, though he soon made peace with Mathers and left for the Alpha et Omega.[\n\nThe first gesture of independence brought a committee of twelve to govern for a year. Further developments forced them to realise that this was far from satisfactory. With pettiness and further dispute, they abandoned every reform and went back to the original scheme of appointing three chiefs to lead and govern them.\n\nWhile visiting New Zealand in 1912, Dr. Felkin issued a Warrant for the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No. 49 (commonly referred to as Whare Ra (Maori for \"House of the Sun\")), which operated in the basement of his purpose built home at Havelock North, in the Hawke's Bay Region. Felkin's visit was closely associated with the \"New Zealand Province of the Societas Rosicruciana\". The stay was supposed to be permanent, but Mr. Meakin, who was to take over as chief of the Amoun Temple, died in the autumn of 1912. Felkin returned to England, but moved to New Zealand permanently in 1916.\n\nDuring the next few years, Felkin established Hermes Lodge in Bristol, the Secret College in London, and Merlin Lodge, also in London.\n\nThe Amoun Temple of the Stella Matutina in London closed its doors in 1919. due to two members becoming schizophrenic, one of whom, a clergyman, was later to die in a mental institution.\n\nIn 1933, Israel Regardie joined the Hermes Temple in Bristol, and resigned from Amoun Temple in 1934, finding it, according to him, in a state of low morale and decay. Many of the original Golden Dawn's Knowledge Lectures had been \"removed or heavily amended, largely because they were beyond the capacity of the chiefs.\" These same chiefs claimed \"extraordinarily exalted\" grades, but Regardie found them lacking. As an example, he recounted that no one in the temple knew how to play Enochian chess, in fact the Order's chess set had never been used. He constructed his own boards and he challenged his superiors in the Order to play: all refused with excuses.\n\nBy 1939, Stella Matutina became largely dormant, although the Hermes Temple continued until 1970. Whare Ra in New Zealand continued until 1978.\n\nFrom the very beginning, Felkin believed that the Order must in fact gain contact with the Secret Chiefs by the use of astral work and communications which were received through either trance or automatic writing, as well as his wish that there should be unity among the Rosicrucians. Great importance was given to these messages, which were coming in considerable numbers, some of which gave approval to make changes to the rituals. Felkin constructed new rituals for the Stella Matutina, which included \"Adeptus Major\", \"Adeptus Exemptus\", and \"Magister Templi\", all of which bear resemblance to the original Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Degree rituals of Ordo Templi Orientis before they were rewritten by Aleister Crowley.\n\nAt this point, according to Francis King, the chiefs of the Amoun Temple were addicted to mediumship and astral travel. Their interpretation of the Golden Dawn techniques of astral projection and travel appears to have been derived from Florence Farr's \"Sphere\" group.\n\nThere were two main astral entities contacted. The first group were Rosicrucian, in which at times the medium believed to be controlled by Christian Rosenkreuz himself. The second were called Arabs, said to be the teachers of the Rosicrucians. The orders given by these \"Arabs\" had a substantial effect on the policies. For example, instructions received on January 9, 1915 was put into effect by the foundation of the Anglican spiritual healers organisation called the \"Guild of St. Raphael\", as Francis King notes, \"were almost without exception, members of the Stella Matutina\". Recent documentary evidence, however, suggests King may have been mistaken and the Guild was not linked to Felkin (Chrism, 2006, p2)\n\nFelkin was not satisfied with astral meetings as he wished for physical contact with the Secret Chiefs. From 1901 onwards, he traveled extensively in hoping to meet authentic Rosicrucians. In 1906, he believed he had found what he was looking for: a professor, his adopted daughter, and another gentleman, all who he believed were in fact Rosicrucians. The professors' adopted daughter had claimed to be the niece of Anna Sprengel (the Secret Chief who authorised the founding of the original Golden Dawn), and also claimed that her aunt was a member of the same organization as herself.\n\nThe purported Rosicrucian group which Felkin had made contact with was led by Rudolf Steiner, founder of the Anthroposophical Society, and at that time, still head of the German section of the Theosophical Society. King explains that it didn't appear as though this group was Theosophical, nor did it appear to be any later form of Anthroposophy. He speculates that, since Steiner was at that time also the Austrian Chief of Ordo Templi Orientis, his first Rosicrucian grade bore resemblance to the original first Degree of O.T.O.\n\n\n\n"}

They are part of a large group of ethnic groups called Bakalanga. Over the years Batalaote lost their language and adopted Kalanga for those in Zimbabwe and Sengwato, which is spoken by the Bangwato, for those in Botswana. The Talaunda and the Wadoma could share a common ancestor. Both tribes have significantly high cases of ectrodactyly.\n\nBatalaote (sometimes spelt \"Talaunda\") meaning glance back while trudging on, are a very large tribe even though they are divided and live in various parts of Botswana and Western Zimbabwe. They are Rozvi people and their totem is a heart/pelo/moyo and they do not pierce their ears. They are a very peaceful tribe which migrated from Zimbabwe; they came from the same region in East Africa as the Shona. They fled Zimbabwe to Senyawe in Botswana because of the intertribal wars. They lived with the Bangwato when they settled in Botswana. Some of them accompanied Ratiltadi and Mpoengs who fled from Kgama into Plumtree, Zimbabwe. The Rozvi are the people from where the Mambo dynasty emerged. It is now thought that these Kalanga/Rozvi people built the Mapungubwe and Great Zimbabwe ruins.\nThe Gululu are a smaller family within the Talaunda; their origin dates back to the aftermath of a genocide attempt by King Mzilikazi after Kedikilwe, brother of Musemwe, misled the King on the whereabouts of herds of cattle that belonged to the Talaunda and the Bangwato in Botswana. The survivors of that attack adopted the name Gululu or Gwababa in SiNdebele, as the king's warriors had unwittingly mistaken rustling noises in the bushes made by these Talaunda for creeping Monitor lizards (called Gululu in Kalanga).\n\nTheir first settlement in Botswana was in a small village north-east of Botswana called Senyawe, where they lived on a hill. Batalaote are still in Senyawe village. They were divided due to the search for greener pastures, intertribal marriage and intertribal wars. That is why there are some Batalaote in Plumtree, Matopos, Serowe, Mmadinare, Makaleng, Bobirwa.\n\nSeveral of the Talaote/Talunada people seek government-assisted repatriation from their current locations to locations that are governed by Talaote chiefs and tribal princes.\n\nBakalanga-Banyai, just like any other African tribe has dialects; their dialects are\n\nDhalaunda was the leader of one of these Kalanga sub-tribes, and the clan was named after him, originally Badhalaunda, but then Bangwato changed it to Batalaote, as they changed Bakalanga to Bakalaka, maybe because of difficulty pronouncing the Kalanga words. They are found in the central district of Botswana and south-western parts of Zimbabwe. Over the years the Talaunda dialect was levelled to other Ikalanga dialects, just as the north-eastern Tjikalanga dialect is shifting to Tjililma. Some of them live in Serowe; former President of Botswana, Festus Mogae, is a member. These have completely lost their Ikalanga identity, and now just identify themselves as Talaote or Ngwato, with little knowledge of what Talaote really means. Most Talaote tribe who witnessed the conflicts between their rulers fled Botswana for South Africa. Most Batalaota are currently found in the Malebogo District in the Blouberg Municipality.\n\n"}

Today Tlapanecs live primarily in the state of Guerrero a number more than 98,000.\n\nIn pre-Columbian times they lived in the isolated mountain area along the Costa Chica region of Guerrero, just southeast of present-day Acapulco. Their territory was called \"Yopitzinco\" by the Aztecs who also referred to the Tlapanecs as Yopi. Yopitzinco was never conquered by the Aztecs and remained an independent enclave within the Aztec empire. The main Tlapanec city was Tlapan and the name \"Tlapanec\" is the Nahuatl for \"Inhabitant of Tlapan\".\n\nThe Tlapanecs explain natural phenomena through myth, like the myth of the creation of the sun (\"Akha\"'), the moon (\"Gon<nowiki>'</nowiki>\") and the fire god (\"Akuun mbatsuun<nowiki>'</nowiki>\"), who all were born on the bank of the river and who were raised by \"Akuun ñee\", goddess of the temazcal sweatbath and patron of the hot/cold duality.\n\nAnother important element in their culture is nagualism.

In that way urban art combines street art and graffiti and is often used to summarize all visual art forms arising in urban areas, being inspired by urban architecture or present urban lifestyle. Because the urban arts are characterized by existing in the public space, they are often viewed as vandalism and destruction of private property.\n\nAlthough urban art started at the neighborhood level, where a lot of people of different cultures live together, it is an international art form with an unlimited number of uses nowadays. Many urban artists travel from city to city and have social contacts all over the world. The notion of 'Urban Art' developed from street art which is primarily concerned with graffiti culture. Urban art represents a broader cross-section of artists that, in addition to covering traditional street artists working in formal gallery spaces, also cover artists using more traditional media but with a subject matter that deals with contemporary urban culture and political issues. In Paris, Le Mur is a public museum of urban art.\n\nThough starting as an underground movement, urban artists like Banksy and Adam Neate have now gained mainstream status and have, in turn, propelled the urban art scene into popular culture. Perceptions have started to change as urban movements such as graffiti slowly gain acceptance from the public. A confirmation of street art's new mainstream status can be, in part, confirmed by an invitation from the Tate calling upon artists to create outdoor pieces on the Thames side of the gallery in the summer of 2008.\n\nThe band Gorillaz uses an urban art style to promote their band. The band members are animated in a graffiti style.\n\n\n\n\n"}
