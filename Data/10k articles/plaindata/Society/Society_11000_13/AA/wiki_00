{"id": "159806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159806", "title": "Anglo-Irish people", "text": "Anglo-Irish people\n\nAnglo-Irish () is a term which was more commonly used in the 19th and early 20th centuries to identify a social class in Ireland, whose members are mostly the descendants and successors of the English Protestant Ascendancy. They mostly belong to the Anglican Church of Ireland, which was the established church of Ireland until 1871, or to a lesser extent one of the English dissenting churches, such as the Methodist church, though some were also Catholic. Its members tended to follow English practices in matters of culture, science, law, agriculture and politics but often defined themselves as simply \"Irish\" or \"British\", and rarely \"Anglo-Irish\" or \"English\". Many became eminent as administrators in the British Empire and as senior army and naval officers. Others were prominent Irish nationalists.\n\nThe term is not usually applied to Presbyterians in the province of Ulster, whose ancestry is mostly Lowland Scottish, rather than English or Irish, and who are sometimes identified as Ulster-Scots. The Anglo-Irish held a wide range of political views, with some being outspoken Irish Nationalists, but most overall being Unionists. And while many of the Anglo-Irish were part of the English diaspora in Ireland, some were of native Irish origin in part and Catholic but had converted to Anglicanism.\n\nThe term \"Anglo-Irish\" is often applied to the members of the Church of Ireland who made up the professional and landed class in Ireland from the 17th century up to the time of Irish independence in the early 20th century. In the course of the 17th century, this Anglo-Irish landed class replaced the Gaelic Irish and Old English aristocracies as the ruling class in Ireland. They were also referred to as \"New English\" to distinguish them from the \"Old English\", who descended from the medieval Hiberno-Norman settlers.\n\nA larger but less socially prominent element of the Protestant Irish population were immigrant French Huguenots and the English and Scottish dissenters who settled in Ireland in the 17th and 18th centuries in the plantation period. Many of these, especially the Scots-Irish or their descendants, emigrated to the American colonies, particularly in the eighteenth century before the American Revolutionary War.\n\nUnder the Penal Laws, which were in force between the 17th and 19th centuries (although enforced with varying degrees of severity), Roman Catholic recusants in Great Britain and Ireland were barred from holding public office, while in Ireland they were also barred from entry to the University of Dublin and from professions such as law, medicine, and the military. The lands of the recusant Roman Catholic landed gentry who refused to take the prescribed oaths were largely confiscated during the Plantations of Ireland. The rights of Roman Catholics to inherit landed property were severely restricted. Those who converted to the Church of Ireland were usually able to keep or regain their lost property, as the issue was considered primarily one of allegiance. In the late 18th century, the Parliament of Ireland in Dublin won legislative independence, and the movement for the repeal of the Test Acts began.\n\nNot all Anglo-Irish people could trace their origins to the Protestant English settlers of the Cromwellian period; some were of Welsh stock, and others descended from Old English or even native Gaelic converts to Anglicanism. Members of this ruling class commonly identified themselves as Irish, while retaining English habits in politics, commerce, and culture. They participated in the popular English sports of the day, particularly racing and fox hunting, and intermarried with the ruling classes in Great Britain. Many of the more successful of them spent much of their careers either in Great Britain or in some part of the British Empire. Many constructed large country houses, which became known in Ireland as Big Houses, and these became symbolic of the class' dominance in Irish society.\n\nThe Dublin working class playwright Brendan Behan, a staunch Irish Republican, saw the Anglo-Irish as Ireland's leisure class and famously defined an Anglo-Irishman as \"a Protestant with a horse\".\n\nThe Anglo-Irish novelist and short story writer Elizabeth Bowen memorably described her experience as feeling \"English in Ireland, Irish in England\" and not accepted fully as belonging to either.\n\nDue to their prominence in the military and their conservative politics, the Anglo-Irish have been compared to the Prussian Junker class by, among others, Correlli Barnett.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the Anglo-Irish owned many of the major indigenous businesses in Ireland, such as Jacob's Biscuits, Bewley's, Beamish and Crawford, Jameson's Whiskey, W. P. & R. Odlum, Cleeve's, R&H Hall, Maguire & Patterson, Dockrell's, Arnott's, Goulding Chemicals, the \"Irish Times\", the Irish Railways, and the Guinness brewery, Ireland's largest employer. They also controlled financial companies such as the Bank of Ireland and Goodbody Stockbrokers.\n\nProminent Anglo-Irish poets, writers, and playwrights include Maria Edgeworth, Jonathan Swift, George Berkeley, Oliver Goldsmith, George Darley, Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde, J. M. Synge, W. B. Yeats, Cecil Day-Lewis, Bernard Shaw, Augusta, Lady Gregory, Samuel Beckett, Giles Cooper, C. S. Lewis, Lord Longford, Elizabeth Bowen, William Trevor and William Allingham.\n\nIn the 19th century, some of the most prominent mathematical and physical scientists of the British Isles, including Sir William Rowan Hamilton, Sir George Stokes, John Tyndall, George Johnstone Stoney, Thomas Romney Robinson, Edward Sabine, Thomas Andrews, Lord Rosse, George Salmon, and George FitzGerald, were Anglo-Irish. In the 20th-century, scientists John Joly and Ernest Walton were also Anglo-Irish, as was the polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. Medical experts included Sir William Wilde, Robert Graves, Thomas Wrigley Grimshaw, William Stokes, Robert Collis, Sir John Lumsden and William Babington.\n\nThe Anglo-Irishmen Edmund Burke, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Henry Grattan, Lord Castlereagh, George Canning, Lord Macartney, Thomas Spring Rice, Charles Stewart Parnell, and Edward Carson played major roles in British politics.\n\nThe Anglo-Irish were also represented among the senior officers of the British Army by men such as Field Marshal Earl Roberts, first honorary Colonel of the Irish Guards regiment, who spent most of his career in British India; Field Marshal Viscount Gough, who served under Wellington, himself a Wellesley born in Dublin to the Earl of Mornington, head of a prominent Anglo-Irish family in Dublin; and in the 20th century Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke, Field Marshal Lord Alexander of Tunis, Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and Field Marshal Sir Garnet Wolseley. (see also Irish military diaspora).\n\nFrederick Matthew Darley emigrated to Australia, where he became Chief Justice of New South Wales.\n\nProlific art music composers included Michael William Balfe, John Field, George Alexander Osborne, Thomas Roseingrave, Charles Villiers Stanford, John Andrew Stevenson, Robert Prescott Stewart, William Vincent Wallace, and Charles Wood.\n\nIn the visual arts, sculptor John Henry Foley, art dealer Hugh Lane, artists Daniel Maclise, William Orpen and Jack Yeats; ballerina Dame Ninette de Valois and designer-architect Eileen Gray were famous outside Ireland.\n\nWilliam Desmond Taylor was an early and prolific maker of silent films in Hollywood.\n\nPhilanthropists included Thomas Barnardo and Lord Iveagh.\n\nDiscussing what he considered the lack of Irish civic morality in 2011, former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald remarked that before 1922: \"In Ireland a strong civic sense did exist – but mainly amongst Protestants and especially Anglicans\".\nThe Anglo-Irish, as a class, were mostly opposed to the notions of Irish independence and Home Rule. Most were supporters of continued political union with Great Britain, which existed between 1800 and 1922. This was for many reasons, but most important were the economic benefits of union for the landowning class, the close personal and familial relations with the British establishment, and the political prominence held by the Anglo-Irish in Ireland under the union settlement. Many Anglo-Irish men served as officers in the British Army, were clergymen in the established Anglican Church of Ireland or had land (or business interests) across the British Isles – all factors which encouraged political support for unionism. Between the mid-nineteenth century and 1922, the Anglo-Irish comprised the bulk of the support for movements such as the Irish Unionist Alliance, especially in the southern three provinces of Ireland.\n\nHowever, Protestants in Ireland, and the Anglo-Irish class in particular, were by no means universally attached to the cause of continued political union with Great Britain. For instance, author Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), a clergyman in the Church of Ireland, vigorously denounced the plight of ordinary Irish people under British rule. Reformist politicians such as Henry Grattan (1746–1820), Wolfe Tone (1763–1798), Robert Emmet (1778–1803), Sir John Gray (1815-1875), and Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891), were also Protestant nationalists, and in large measure led and defined Irish nationalism. The Irish Rebellion of 1798 was led by members of the Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots class, some of whom feared the political implications of the impending union with Great Britain. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, Irish nationalism became increasingly tied to a Roman Catholic identity. By the beginning of the twentieth century, many Anglo-Irishmen in southern Ireland had become convinced of the need for a political settlement with Irish nationalists. Anglo-Irish politicians such as Sir Horace Plunkett and Lord Monteagle became leading figures in finding a peaceful solution to the 'Irish question'.\n\nDuring the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), many Anglo-Irish landlords left the country due to attacks on their family homes. Animosity towards them continued after the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. Many members of the Anglo-Irish class subsequently left Ireland forever, fearing that they would be subject to discriminatory legislation and social pressures. The Protestant proportion of the Irish population dropped from 10% (300,000) to 6% (180,000) in the Irish Free State in the twenty-five years following independence, with most resettling in Britain. In the whole of Ireland the percentage of Protestants was 26% (1.1 million).\n\nThe reaction of the Anglo-Irish to the Anglo-Irish Treaty which envisaged the establishment of the Irish Free State was mixed. J. A. F. Gregg, the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, stated in a sermon in December 1921 (the month the Treaty was signed):\n\nIn 1925, when the Irish Free State was poised to outlaw divorce, the poet W. B. Yeats delivered a famous eulogy on the Anglo-Irish in the Free State's Senate:\n\nNowadays, the term \"Anglo-Irish\" is not as commonly used to describe southern Irish Protestants of English descent, or Protestant citizens of the Republic of Ireland as a group, since —despite retaining a certain distinctive identity— they mostly are also keen to stress their Irishness and loyalty to the Republic of Ireland.\n\nFollowing the English victory in the Nine Years' War (1594–1603), the \"Flight of the Earls\" in 1607, the traditional Gaelic Irish nobility was displaced in Ireland, particularly in the Cromwellian period. By 1707, after further defeat in the Williamite War and the subsequent Union of England and Scotland, the aristocracy in Ireland was dominated by Anglican families who owed allegiance to the Crown. Some of these were Irish families who had chosen to conform to the established Church of Ireland, keeping their lands and privileges, such as the Dukes of Leinster (whose surname is FitzGerald, and who descend from the Old English aristocracy), or the Gaelic Guinness family. Some were families of British or mixed-British ancestry who owed their status in Ireland to the Crown, such as the Earls of Cork (whose surname is Boyle and whose ancestral roots were in Herefordshire, England).\n\nAmong the prominent Anglo-Irish peers are:\n\nUntil the year 1800, the peers of Ireland were all entitled to a seat in the Irish House of Lords, the upper house of the Parliament of Ireland, in Dublin. After 1800, under the provisions of the Act of Union, the Parliament of Ireland was abolished and the Irish peers were entitled to elect twenty-eight of their number to sit in the British House of Lords, in London, as representative peers. During the Georgian Era, titles in the peerage of Ireland were often granted by the British monarch to Englishmen with little or no connection to Ireland, as a way of preventing such honours from inflating the membership of the British House of Lords.\n\nA number of Anglo-Irish peers have been appointed by Presidents of Ireland to serve on their advisory Council of State. Some were also considered possible candidates for presidents of Ireland, including:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33469519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33469519", "title": "Bajju people", "text": "Bajju people\n\nThe Bajju are an ethnic group found in the Middle Belt Region of Nigeria. They are found in the Southern part of Kaduna State in Kachia, Zangon Kataf and Jama'a Local Government Areas. Bajju people are also commonly known as \"Kaje\" which is a pejorative name used to refer to both the Bajju people and Jju language by the larger Hausa people who could not pronounce the name Kajju (meaning the land of the Bajju people) well. The Bajju people are predominantly farmers, hunters, blacksmiths and petty traders.\n\nThe Bajju paramount Leader is called Agwam Bajju. The current leader is His Royal Highness the Agwam Bajju, Agwam Nuhu Bature Achi.\n\nThe Bajju People, speak the Jju language , which is one of the Central Plateau languages, and seems to be a variant of Tyap.\n\nAccording to oral history, the origin of the Bajju can be traced as far as Bauchi State where a group of people lived in hill caves and had watchers atop the hill to watch for enemies. These people were called 'mutanen duwatsu' (literal translation in English is 'the stone people'). It was believed that their migration was for the search of better hunting grounds. They migrated from Bauchi State to Plateau State (of Nigeria) and settled on a hill called 'Hurruang'. The hill was already occupied by a tribe called the Jarawa, but the Jarawa people left and lived on another hill called 'Tsok-kwon'.\n\nThe Jarawa were a faction of a larger tribe called 'Miango'. The Bajju, Miango, and Jarawa tribes collectively called themselves 'Dangi' (meaning 'those of same stock') because they share cultural and linguistic similarities. \n\nTwo brothers named Zampara and Wai were said to have left ‘Dangi’ settlement and migrated South of the Plateau.\nThe Chawai people of today are the descendants Wai. Wai settled at a place and named it Chawai. Considering that the forefathers of both the Bajju and Chawai people had family ties made both nations affiliated. \n\nZampara migrated further and settled at Hurbuang , which is now called Ungwan Tabo. Zampara had a wife named Adama (who was a Fulani woman) and gave birth to two sons, Baranzan and Akad. When Zampara, their father died Akad left his elder brother Baranzan and stayed near the hills. He did so and became the ancestor of the Atakat people. That was how the Atakat tribe got associated with the Bajju. It was because of this close relationship that the Atakat and Bajju people made it a tradition and a religious law never to intermarry. \n\nHowever, some stubborn Bajju and Atakat people intermarried, and this caused the widespread death of 1970, Gaiya (2013). The Gado of Bajju, along with his people, met with the Gado of Atakat, along with his people, to discuss the crisis of frequent deaths of people of both tribes as a result of the intermarriages. \n\nThey reached a decision to abolish the law religiously and traditionally so that there would not be any consequence for the intermarriage. That was how the Atakat and Bajju people began to intermarry freely.\n\nThe previously mentioned Baranzan (son of Zampara, and brother of Akad) left Hurbuang and cleared a place by a riverside called 'Duccuu Cheng'. He settled the Kajju there (Kajju was the initial name of the Bajju). The name 'Kajju' was derived from the name which Baranzan gave the new settlement, which was 'Kazzu'. \n\nAlthough it is unclear from oral history when the migration occurred, but evidence suggests that the Bajju were in their current location since the early 1800s, Gaiya (2013).\n\nThere are many rites in Kajju land such as things like rain, farming, harvest, new house, pregnancy, and child-naming. \nTyyi Tson (Euthanasia): Tyyi Tson means 'to give hungry rice' (hungry rice was a type of rice which the Bajju thought of as the most sacred and perhaps elite). This practice involved offering an elderly woman poisoned hungry rice (called 'Kasap') to end her suffering of physical infirmity. It was usually done by one of her children or her sister. \n\nNkut: (witchcraft) This is the power to exert spiritual influence over another person. People who use Nkut are referred to as 'Akut', and are believed to have a second set of eyes. The first set allows one to see the physical, while the other is used to see into the spiritual realm.\n\nGajimale (water spirit): A gajimale comes out of rivers, or streams to seduce its victims by transforming into a good looking opposite sex of the victim. It was a belief that many rich people got their wealth from Gajimale, and in return, they gave children to it. Epliepsy (known as 'rong ncen' meaning 'fire of the river') was believed to be caused by the Gajimale.\n\nAbvoi: The Bajju worshipped the god Abvoi. The leader of the Abvoi shrine was called the 'Gado Abvoi' or 'Dodo'. The 'Magajin Abvoi' is the one who translates the messages of Abvoi to the people. The celebrations involved masquerade dances.\n\nMasquerades (Abusak): They represented the spirits in Abvoi celebrations. The Abusak danced with women and disciplines them by beating them.\n\nChildren were not to eat eggs, and they were not to eat meat offered to them at other households, for it may be Nkut meat neither were they to go out in the heat of the midday sun, for they may accept food from Akut.\n\nWomen:\n\nMen:\n\n\n\nMen could swear the following oaths:\n\n\nWomen could swear the following oaths:\n\n\nThe Bajju people are governed by a traditional leader appointed by the Kaduna State government- A̱gwam Nuhu Bature A̱chi, who governs the affairs of the people majorly settled in Zonkwa. Jju appears to be a variety of or a dialect of Tyap language together with Gworok, Fantswam, Takat and others, whose speakers are ethnically distinct.\n\n3. ^Blench (2008) \"Prospecting proto-Plateau\".

{"id": "30759928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30759928", "title": "Cachirules", "text": "Cachirules\n\nThe Cachirules scandal was a 1988 association football scandal in which the Mexican Football Federation (FEMEXFUT) was found to have knowingly used at least four overage players on the Mexico under-20 team which played at the 1988 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament, a qualification tournament for the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship. FIFA, the world governing body, imposed a severe sanction on FEMEXFUT, banning its senior and underage teams from all international competition for two years (1988–1990). As a result, the Mexico national football team were absent from the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The scandal has been considered a turning point in the history of football in Mexico and North America in general.\n\nMexico and other national youth teams of the CONCACAF region were required to finish in first or second place in the 1988 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament hosted in Guatemala during April 1988 in order to qualify for the 1989 FIFA World Youth Championship in Saudi Arabia.\n\nEarlier in the same year, FIFA issued a statement warning all national associations not to attempt to deceive the footballing authorities regarding the age of players participating in youth tournaments (in response to what was common practice by youth teams across the world of including players of age over the regulatory limit). The maximum age established by FIFA for participation of footballers in the Youth World Championship was 20 years.\n\nMexico first played two matches against Guyana national team, whom they beat by scores of 9–0 and 2–0, and then against locals Guatemala national team, winning again both matches 2–1 and 3–0. This last victory occurred on 20 April 1988 with forward Gerardo Jiménez scoring a goal, which secured the first place of the group for Mexico and their qualification to the World Youth Championship.\n\nJournalist Antonio Moreno from the Mexican public TV network Imevisión (now \"TV Azteca\") and author of a football-dedicated column for Mexican newspaper \"Ovaciones\", discovered in an April 1988 yearbook (1986–87 edition) published by FEMEXFUT itself, a discrepancy between the players' ages shown in the publication and the ones submitted by the federation to CONCACAF for the qualification tournament in Guatemala. On 20 April 1988 Moreno published an article emphasizing the risks of \"trying to create an advantage over the opponents by including players over the permitted age\". In response, the then FEMEXFUT president Rafael del Castillo played down the matter and verbally attacked the reporter.\n\nAntonio Moreno, however, was backed up by fellow \"Imevisión\" journalist José Ramón Fernández, from the show \"La Misma Hora\", who broadcast the news on television. The initial reaction of the FEMEXFUT was to deny and ignore the accusations, but once the public realized the magnitude of the scandal, many Mexican journalists began to interview the players and to insistently look for the team members' birth certificates; eventually, the real birth dates of players Gerardo Jiménez and José de la Fuente, both two years older than the established limit by the FEMEXFUT, were found. Forward José Luis Mata was over the age limit by three years, and defender Aurelio Rivera was four years over. Rivera, at the time the team captain, has declared in later interviews that every one of the members of the squad was over age, although such affirmation has not been verified.\n\nThe information was widely spread on televised and written media in Mexico and inevitably reached the United States Soccer Federation, who submitted an official complaint to CONCACAF demanding the case to be investigated after its youth team failed to qualify for the U-20 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. The Guatemalan Football Federation joined the protest. The discovery was conducted by Salvadorean José Ramón Flores, who promptly verified the falsity of the ages submitted by the FEMEXFUT for the tournament's squad members.\n\nAs a result, CONCACAF initially determined on June 19, 1988 that the ages of the four said players were in fact false and Mexico was disqualified from participation in the Saudi Arabia Youth World Championship; further, several officials were sidelined for life (but not the team coach Francisco Avilán), among them José de Jesús Alvarez Guzmán, Rafael Castellanos, Rafael del Castillo, Víctor Manuel González, Ramón Martínez, Manuel Acevez Montenegro, Gerardo Gallegos, Gilberto Morfín Salazar, and Héctor Antonio Pérez. With the expulsion of Mexico, it was the Guatemalan team who replaced them at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and along with the United States were the two sole CONCACAF representatives. Meanwhile, the United States replaced Mexico and, along with Costa Rica, they were the two CONCACAF nations to qualify to the World Youth Championship.\n\nRafael del Castillo traveled to Zurich on June 22, 1988 and attempted to appeal before FIFA, hoping to overturn the lifeban issued by CONCACAF; no regard was given to the situation of Mexico's football suspension The Mexico executives arrived at the FIFA headquarters confident on the influence that Guillermo Cañedo might have within the world football's governing body, but they did not achieve the expected results.\n\nOn June 30, 1988, FIFA not only backed the measures dictated by CONCACAF, which had punished only the Mexican youth team, but in addition, increased the sentence by disqualifying all Mexico national teams, including the senior team, from every FIFA-sanctioned international competition for a period of two years; therefore, Mexico was left out of the 1988 Olympic tournament in Seoul, as well as the 1990 FIFA World Cup having been precluded from participation in the preliminary qualification rounds. \n\nPrevious violators of age limits had only received bans from underage competitions; FIFA said the harsher punishment was intended \"to serve as a strong warning\". The following week FIFA made the United States host for the 1994 World Cup; a conspiracy theory holds that Mexico's disqualification from the 1990 tournament was intended to make it easier for the U.S. team to qualify, and so drum up interest in the sport there.\n\nA possible origin of the word refers to the slang word \"cachirul\" or \"cachirulo\", term used in Mexico at the beginning of the 20th century to designate a patch or repair of bad quality on clothing. Alternatively, the term \"cachirul\" or \"cachirulo\" was employed for all things of questionable quality, origin, or reputation. Football used the adjective in the yards of lower amateur categories in cities and towns of Mexico, referring to players whom without being part of the team roster, would take the field in order to complete the team and thus avoid losing the game due to lack of players. This implicated deceiving the referee, as players used other player's identity, creating a \"cachirul\". As time passed, and especially after the 1988 scandal, the term \"cachirul\" in Mexico has become almost exclusively a footballing term.\n\n"}

Although scholarly and reserved, he preached two sermons in 1892 in which he attacked the political corruption of New York City government. Backed by the evidence he collected, his statements led to both the exposure of Tammany Hall and to subsequent social and political reforms.\n\nHe was born on a farm on April 17, 1842 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Parkhurst did not attend a formal school until he was twelve. Despite this, he showed a strong interest in education and graduated from Amherst in 1866. He became principal of the high school in Amherst in 1867. He married Ellen Bodman on November 23, 1870, she being one of his former students. Parkhurst studied theology at Halle in 1869, and became a professor at the Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts, in 1870–1871.\n\nAfter further studies in Leipzig in 1872–1873, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. He was pastor of a congregational church at Lenox, Massachusetts, from 1874 until 1880, when he was called to the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, New York City, where he served from 1880 to 1918.\n\nInterested in municipal affairs, Parkhurst was elected president of the New York Society for the Prevention of Crime in 1891, and he challenged the methods of the city police department. He inaugurated a campaign against the political and social corruption of Tammany Hall. The hall had begun innocently as a social club, but had drifted into politics and graft. It acquired a lock on elections in the city, and its bosses protected crime and vice in Manhattan and surrounding boroughs. Grand jury investigations were ineffective, despite the appeals of social reformers. Few in Parkhurst's congregation recognized that Tammany Hall, the police, and organized crime were interconnected.\n\nOn February 14, 1892, he challenged Tammany Hall from the pulpit. Pointing to the hall's political influence and their connection with the police, he noted that men fed upon the city while pretending to protect it saying,\n\nWhen the municipal grand jury asked him for hard evidence, Parkhurst personally hired a private detective and, with his friend John Erving, went to the streets in disguise to collect proof of the corruption. From the pulpit on March 13, 1892, he preached a sermon backed with documentation and affidavits. Parkhurst's campaign led to the appointment of the Lexow Committee to investigate conditions, and to the election of a reform mayor in 1894. Although Tammany Hall did publicly clean house, it remained influential on both the political front and in organized crime until the 1950s.\n\nParkhurst was opposed to women voting. He wrote:\n\nThat quality of feminine blatancy which is being at present so extensively advertised here and in England, that disposition toward self-exploitation indulged in by short-haired women and encouraged by long-haired men, is of a sort to chill and then freeze over those masculine impulses that seek restful and satisfying companionship in a member of the opposite sex.\n\nHis first wife, Ellen Bodman, died on May 28, 1921. He married Eleanor Marx on April 18, 1927, in Los Angeles.\n\nParkhurst died on September 8, 1933, by sleepwalking and walking off the porch roof in his Ventnor City, New Jersey, home.\n\nParkhurst was published in a number of magazines, and was the author of: \n\n"}

They call themselves \"qne-a tnya-e\" and their language \"Chaq-f tnya-b\".\n\nChatino populations are found in the following Oaxacan municipalities, mostly in the area around Juquila: Santos Reyes Nopala, San Juan Quiahije, San Miguel Panixtlahuaca, Santiago Yaitepec, Santa Cruz Zenzontepec, San Juan Lachao, Santa María Temaxcaltepec, Santa Catarina Juquila and Tataltepec de Valdés.\n\nThe region that the Chatinos inhabit is rich in natural resources. Traditionally many Chatino people have been involved in agriculture, which depends very much on the climate, so some Chatinos have had to emigrate to the corners of the district of Juquila to work on coffee plantations. Most Chatino communities have public services, and there are runways for airports in many municipalities. Federal bilingual schools, high schools, and \"telesecundarias\" (distance education programs for secondary and high school students) have been established.\n\nThe traditional authorities of this people are organized in a system based on civil and religious roles, in which advice from elders is treated as the greatest authority. They believe in the Holy Grandmother, the Holy Father Sun, the Holy Mother Earth, and the Holy Mother Moon. In addition, they worship the deities of water, wind, rain, the mountain, and fire.\n\nChatino language is an indigenous Mesoamerican language, which is classified under the Zapotecan branch of the Oto-Manguean language family. The Chatino have close cultural and linguistic ties with the Zapotec peoples, whose Zapotec language is the other member of the Zapotecan languages.\nAccording to Campbell, there are three main Chatino languages, which exhibit varying degrees of mutual intelligibility: Zenzontepec Chatino, Tataltepec Chatino, and Eastern Chatino.\n\n"}

A co-founder of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), she directed its militant actions from exile in France from 1912 to 1913. In 1914 she supported the war against Germany. After the war she moved to the United States, where she worked as an evangelist for the Second Adventist movement.\n\nChristabel Pankhurst was the daughter of women's suffrage movement leader Emmeline Pankhurst and radical socialist Richard Pankhurst and sister to Sylvia and Adela Pankhurst. Her father was a barrister and her mother owned a small shop. Christabel assisted her mother, who worked as the Registrar of Births and Deaths in Manchester. Despite financial struggles, her family had always been encouraged by their firm belief in their devotion to causes rather than comforts.\n\nNancy Ellen Rupprecht wrote, \"She was almost a textbook illustration of the first child born to a middle-class family. In childhood as well as adulthood, she was beautiful, intelligent, graceful, confident, charming, and charismatic.\" Christabel enjoyed a special relationship with both her mother and father, who had named her after \"Christabel\", the poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (\"The lovely lady Christabel / Whom her father loves so well\"). Her mother's death in 1928 had a devastating impact on Christabel.\n\nPankhurst learned to read at her home on her own before she went to school. She and her two sisters attended Manchester High School for Girls. She obtained a law degree from the University of Manchester, and received honours on her LL.B. exam but because she was a woman she was not allowed to practice law. Later Pankhurst moved to Geneva to live with a family friend, but returned home to help her mother raise the rest of the children, when her father died in 1898.\n\nIn 1905 Christabel Pankhurst interrupted a Liberal Party meeting by shouting demands for voting rights for women. She was arrested and, along with fellow suffragist Annie Kenney, went to prison rather than pay a fine as punishment for their outburst. Their case gained much media interest and the ranks of the WSPU swelled following their trial. Emmeline Pankhurst began to take more militant action for the women's suffrage cause after her daughter's arrest and was herself imprisoned on many occasions for her principles.\n\nAfter obtaining her law degree in 1906, Christabel moved to the London headquarters of the WSPU, where she was appointed its organising secretary. Nicknamed \"Queen of the Mob\", she was jailed again in 1907 in Parliament Square and in 1909 after the \"Rush Trial\" at Bow Street. Between 1913 and 1914 she lived in Paris, France, to escape imprisonment under the terms of the Prisoner's (Temporary Discharge for Ill-Health) Act, better known as the \"Cat and Mouse Act\". The start of World War I compelled her to return to England in 1914, where she was again arrested. Pankhurst engaged in a hunger strike, ultimately serving only 30 days of a three-year sentence.\n\nShe was influential in the WSPU's \"anti-male\" phase after the failure of the Conciliation Bills. She wrote a book called \"The Great Scourge and How to End It\" on the subject of sexually transmitted diseases and how sexual equality (votes for women) would help the fight against these diseases.\n\nShe and her sister Sylvia did not get along. Sylvia was against turning the WSPU towards solely upper- and middle-class women and using militant tactics, while Christabel thought it was essential. Christabel felt that suffrage was a cause that should not be tied to any causes trying to help working-class women with their other issues. She felt that it would only drag the suffrage movement down and that all of the other issues could be solved once women had the right to vote.\n\nOn 8 September 1914, Pankhurst re-appeared at London's Royal Opera House after her long exile, to utter a declaration on \"The German Peril\", a campaign led by the former General Secretary of the WSPU, Norah Dacre Fox in conjunction with the British Empire Union and the National Party. Along with Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam), Pankhurst toured the country making recruiting speeches. Her supporters handed the white feather to every young man they encountered wearing civilian dress. \"The Suffragette\" appeared again on 16 April 1915 as a war paper and on 15 October changed its name to \"Britannia.\" In its pages, week by week, Pankhurst called for the military conscription of men and the industrial conscription of women into national service. She called also for the internment of all people of enemy nationality, men and women, young and old, found on these shores. Her supporters bobbed up at Hyde Park meetings with placards: \"Intern Them All\". She also championed a more complete and thorough enforcement of the blockade of enemy and neutral nations, arguing that this must be \"a war of attrition\". She demanded the resignation of Sir Edward Grey, Lord Robert Cecil, General Sir William Robertson and Sir Eyre Crowe, whom she considered too mild and dilatory in method. \"Britannia\" was many times raided by the police and experienced greater difficulty in appearing than had befallen \"The Suffragette.\" Indeed, although occasionally Norah Dacre Fox's father, John Doherty, who owned a printing firm, was drafted in to print campaign posters, \"Britannia\" was compelled at last to set up its own printing press. Emmeline Pankhurst proposed to set up Women's Social and Political Union Homes for illegitimate girl \"war babies\", but only five children were adopted. David Lloyd George, whom Pankhurst had regarded as the most bitter and dangerous enemy of women, was now the one politician in whom she and Emmeline Pankhurst placed confidence.\n\nAfter some British women were granted the right to vote at the end of World War I, Pankhurst stood in the 1918 general election as a Women's Party candidate, in alliance with the Lloyd George/Conservative Coalition in the Smethwick constituency. She was narrowly defeated, by only 775 votes to the Labour Party candidate John Davison.\n\nLeaving England in 1921, she moved to the United States where she eventually became an evangelist with Plymouth Brethren links and became a prominent member of Second Adventist movement.\n\nMarshall, Morgan, and Scott published her works on subjects related to her prophetic outlook, which took its character from John Nelson Darby's perspectives. Pankhurst lectured and wrote books on the Second Coming. She was a frequent guest on TV shows in the 1950s and had a reputation for being an odd combination of \"former suffragist revolutionary, evangelical Christian and almost stereotypically proper 'English Lady' who always was in demand as a lecturer\". While in California, she adopted her daughter Betty, finally having recovered from her mother's death.\n\nShe returned to Britain for a period in the 1930s and was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1936. At the onset of World War II she again left for the United States, to live in Los Angeles, California.\n\nChristabel died 13 February 1958, at the age of 77, sitting in a straight-backed chair. Her housekeeper found her body and there was no indication of her cause of death. She was buried in the Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn 2006, a blue plaque for Christabel and her mother was placed by English Heritage at 50 Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, London W11 3AD, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where they had lived. Her name and image (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are etched on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, that was unveiled in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2010 was 20.7%, 71% was between 15 and 65 years of age, while 8.3% was 65 years or older.\n\nStructure of the population (09.01.2011) (Census) :\n\nDue to decreasing fertility, the proportion of children below the age of 15 is decreasing, while the proportion of elderly is increasing. The median age has increased from 21.6 in 1980, 24.1 in 1990, 28.1 in 2000 to 32.6 in 2011.\nThe estimated mid-year population of 2014 is 1,344,000 (medium fertility scenario of The 2012 Revision of the World Population Prospects).\n\nEmigration from Trinidad and Tobago, as with other Caribbean nations, has historically been high; most emigrants go to the United States, Canada, and Britain. Emigration has continued, albeit at a lower rate, even as the birth-rate sharply dropped to levels typical of industrialised countries. Largely because of this phenomenon, as of 2011, Trinidad and Tobago has been experiencing a low population growth rate (0.48%). More recently, there has been some return migration, chiefly from the United States after the recession of 2008, which caused a population jump in the last census in 2011.\n\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\n\nIndo-Trinidadians make up the country's largest ethnic group (approximately 37.6%). They are primarily descendants from indentured workers from South Asia, or the then British Raj, brought to replace emancipated Africans who refused to continue working under the violent, exploitative conditions on the sugar plantations. The Indian community is divided roughly half-and-half between those who maintained their original religions, and those who have converted to Christianity or have no religious affiliation. Through cultural preservation groups, Trinidadians of Indian descent maintain many of their customs, traditions, and language.\n\nAfro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian make up the country's second largest ethnic group (approximately 36.3%). Although enslaved Africans were first imported in 1517, they constituted only 11 percent of the population (310) in 1783.\nThe majority of the enslaved Africans were brought in the last few years of Trinidad's Spanish Colonial era, and the beginning of the British colonial period. The Cedula of Population transformed a small colony of 1,000 in 1773 to 18,627 by 1797. In the census of 1777 there were only 2,763 people recorded as living on the island, including some 2,000 Arawaks. In 1807, the UK Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act 1807 that abolished the trading of enslaved persons, and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished the practice of slavery itself.\n\nThe White-Trinidadian (or Euro Trinidadian) population is primarily descended from early settlers and immigrants. The recent census counted 7,832 people of European descent. These numbers do not include people who have at least some European ancestry or self-identify as African or Indian.\n\nThe French arrived mostly during the Spanish period to take advantage of free agricultural lands. Some Portuguese arrived in mid nineteenth century and more came at the turn of the century. The Europeans who remained in Trinidad live in areas in and around Port of Spain. Furthermore, British rule led to an influx of settlers from the United Kingdom and the British colonies of the Eastern Caribbean and descendants of English indentured workers brought in as overseers following the end of the Second World War. \n\nThe Portuguese came to Tobago and Trinidad as early as the 17th century, including groups of Portuguese Jews, Catholics and Protestants. For over 140 years, from 1834 up to 1975, the ancestors of the modern Portuguese community in Trinidad and Tobago hailed mostly from the archipelago of Madeira, starting from 1846, with the earliest registers being from the Azores in 1834. \n\nThe Portuguese came directly from Madeira, and also via Guyana, St Vincent, Antigua and St Kitts.\n\nImportant communities settled in Port of Spain, Arima, Arouca, Chaguanas, San Fernando and Scarborough. \n\nIn 2011, the Madeiran Portuguese Community of Trinidad and Tobago celebrated their 165th Anniversary of arrival of the first Madeirans in Trinidad back in 1846. \n\nRecalling the presence of the Portuguese in the nation today are over 100 Portuguese surname, some of which have become street nomenclature. As an independent nation, the country has recognised several members of the Portuguese community, through official awards.\n\nIn Tobago, many white residents are retirees who have recently arrived there. \n\nGiven the large number of ethnic identities in Trinidad and Tobago, many citizens have a mixed ethnic heritage due to influences from French, West African, Creole, Chinese, Liberian, Indians, Scotts, Irish, Welsh, German, Swiss, Portuguese, English, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Arab, Jewish, and Russian ancestors. Additionally, there are also nationals of Hispanic Spaniard, Mestizo, Mulatto, and Pardo ancestry, mainly from Venezuela and Colombia, along with a small number from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Common ethnic mixtures include people of European and African descent, mulatto-creoles, and Indian and African descent (often colloquially known as dougla). This mixed population is estimated at around 22.8%; however, it is much higher when considering the various degrees of African, Indian, European, and indigenous Amerindian ancestry of the total population. A person might self identify as African based on physical appearance, for instance, but he or she might be genetically more similar to a person of Indian descent (dougla).\n\nThere are groups of Chinese who, like the Indians, are descended from indentured labourers. They account for about 4,003 people and live mostly in Port-of-Spain and San Fernando. \nIn Trinidad there were, about twenty years ago [i.e. about 1886], 4,000 or 5,000 Chinese, but they have decreased to probably about 2,000 or 3,000, [2,200 in 1900]. They used to work in sugar plantations, but are now principally shopkeepers,as well as general merchants, miners and railway builders,etc.\n\nThere are also about 1,062 Arabs, originating from Syria and Lebanon who live mostly in Port-of-Spain. The Syrian and Lebanese communities of Trinidad are predominantly Christian, migrating from the Middle East in the 19th century from the Ottoman Empire later landing in the Caribbean and Latin America. Other Lebanese and Syrians came in the early to middle 20th century to escape the war and turmoil in the region.\n\nFinally there are the mixed raced Caribs who are descended from the native, precolonial people of the islands. They are organized around the Santa Rosa Carib Community and live mostly in and around Arima.\n\nIn 2011, according to census, Roman Catholicism was again the largest religious denomination with 285,671 followers (21.6% of the total population), having declined from a membership of 289,711 in 2000 (26% of the population). Other religious denominations that experienced decreases in their membership in 2011 were Hinduism (from 22.5% in 2000 to 18.2% in 2011), Anglican (from 7.8% to 5.7%), Presbyterian/Congregational (from 3.3% to 2.5%) and Methodist (from 0.9% to 0.7%). The number of persons claiming affiliation to Pentecostal/Evangelical/Full Gospel more than doubled from 76,327 in 2000 (6.8%) to 159,033 in 2011 (12.0%). The number of Muslims slightly increased but as proportion of the total population there was a decrease from 5.8% in 2000 to 5.0% in 2011. The category ‘None’ witnessed a small increase from 1.9% to 2.2%, while those who did not state a religion increased significantly, from 1.4% to 11.1%. 1.2% of the population are adherents of Baha'i. The African religions and specifically Orisha have become institutions in Trinidad and Tobago's society.They serve not only the obvious religious needs but also as a source of inspiration for personal identity. Many people, motivated by the need to re-claim their African heritage can now openly support these religions because they see in them a source of understanding and a coming to terms with their enslavement and the colonial past.\n"}

This is sometimes referred to as a \"half-eternity\" ring rather than a \"full\" eternity ring.\n\nEternity rings featuring paste gems, white topaz or a mix of stones appeared in the 18th century.\n\nThe concept of the diamond eternity ring was created in the 1960s by diamond merchant De Beers. American investigative journalist Edward Jay Epstein stated that at the time the company had a secret agreement with the Soviet Union which, in return for the creation of a \"single channel\" controlling the world's supply of diamonds, 'required' the purchase of 90-95% of the uncut gem diamonds produced by Russia. The prevailing fashion at the time, particularly for engagement rings, was for them to be set with a single, large diamond. The Soviet gems, however, were small, often less than 0.25 carats. To avoid stockpiling, De Beers embarked on a campaign of promotion of jewelry containing a number of small diamonds culminating in the eternity ring, which was aimed at older, married women. One campaign slogan aimed at husbands was, \"She married you for richer or poorer. Let her know how it’s going.\"\n"}
{"id": "8313535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8313535", "title": "Group conflict", "text": "Group conflict\n\nGroup conflict, or hostilities between different groups, is a feature common to all forms of human social organization (e.g., sports teams, ethnic groups, nations, religions, gangs), and also occurs in social animals. Although group conflict is one of the most complex phenomena studied by social scientists, the history of the human race evidences a series of group-level conflicts that have gained notoriety over the years. For example, from 1820 to 1945, it has been estimated that at least 59 million persons were killed during conflicts between groups of one type or another. Literature suggests that the number of fatalities nearly doubled between the years 1914 to 1964 as a result of further group conflict.\n\nGroup conflict can be separated into two sub-categories of conflict: inter-group conflict (in which distinct groups of individuals are at odds with one another), and intra-group conflict (in which select individuals that are part of the same group clash with one another). Although both forms of conflict have the ability to spiral upward in severity, it has been noted that conflict present at the group level (i.e., inter-group rivalries) is generally considered to be more powerful than conflict present at an individual level – a phenomenon known as the discontinuity effect.\n\nSocial psychology, specifically the discontinuity effect of inter-group conflict, suggests that \"groups are generally even more competitive and aggressive than individuals\". Two main sources of intergroup conflict have been identified: \"competition for valued material resources, according to realistic conflict theory, or for social rewards like respect and esteem...as described by relative deprivation theory\"\n\nGroup conflict can easily enter an escalating spiral of hostility marked by polarisation of views into black and white, with comparable actions viewed in diametrically opposite ways: \"we offer concessions, but they attempt to lure us with ploys. We are steadfast and courageous, but they are unyielding, irrational, stubborn, and blinded by ideology\".\n\nIt is widely believed that intergroup and intragroup hostility are (at least to some degree) inversely related: that \"there is, unhappily, an inverse relationship between external wars and internal strife\". Thus \"in politics, for example, everyone can get an extraordinarily comforting feeling of mutual support from their group by focussing on an enemy\". Freud described a similarly quasi-benign version, whereby \"it is precisely communities with adjoining territories, and related to each other in other ways as well, who are engaged in constant feuds and ridiculing each other like the Spaniards and Portuguese, for instance...[as] a convenient and relatively harmless satisfaction of the inclination to aggression, by means of which cohesion between the members of the community is made easier\". The harder version of the theory would suggest that \"pent-up sub-group aggression, if it cannot combine with the pent-up aggression of other sub-groups to attack a common, foreign enemy, will vent itself in the form of riots, persecutions and rebellions\".\n\nThrough an extensive literature review, Roy J. Eidelson and Judy I. Eidelson, identified parallels between individuals and the collective world views of groups on the basis of five key belief domains.\n\n\nDonald Horowitz also argues that the belief, regardless of its accuracy, that ones group is behind another group can also contribute to conflict and that such groups often face severe anxiety about threats emanating from other groups. The backwards group fears it will be ultimately dominated by more advanced groups. Backwards groups tend to view their individual members with negative qualities, such as laziness and lack of intelligence, while collectively they view themselves as unorganized and lacking unity, with members looking out only for themselves and not their group. In contrast, advanced groups' members are perceived as possessing positive qualities, such as conscientiousness, intelligence and industriousness, while collectively they are perceived as well-organized, cohesive and committed to advancing their group interests. Thus advanced groups are perceived as possessing superior attributes on both individual and collective levels. The resultant anxiety felt by backwards groups can cause them to believe their very survival as a group is a stake and that they risk disappearing, replaced by more advanced groups. Horowitz argues this means backwards groups are more likely to initiate violence.\n\n\nOpinion is divided about the merits of infighting in political movements. Whereas \"the majority of scholars view infighting as sapping political potency\", others argue that \"infighting's value lay in its potential to generate strategic possibilities and promote...accountability\", and that (at least with respect to identity politics) \"infighting is a key site for culture...concretizes cultural conversations\".\n\nAmong extremists \"threatened by the existence of \"anyone\" else, unless that other person's views seem identical to his own\", however, infighting and group fissions become the destructive norm: \"they're all splitting up so fast...they seem to attack each other more than they attack their real enemies on the other side of the political spectrum\".\n\nWithin small groups, the same dichotomy exists. Granted that both constructive and destructive conflict occurs in most small groups, it is very important to accentuate the constructive conflict and minimize the destructive conflict. Conflict is bound to happen, but if used constructively need not be a bad thing.\nUsing constructive conflict within small groups by bringing up problems and alternative solutions (while still valuing others) allows the group to work forward. While \"conflict may involve interpersonal as well as task issues\", keeping a window open for dissent can prove very advantageous, as where a company \"reaped big benefits because it did not simply try to suppress conflict, but allowed minority influence to prevail\".\n\nOn the other hand, there is evidence that an organizational culture of disrespect unproductively \"generates a morass of status games and infighting...'it's made people turn against each other'\" - so that for example \"sexual harassment becomes a chronic accompaniment to broader patterns of infighting\".\n\nLacan saw the roots of intra-group aggression in a regression to the \"narcissistic moment in the subject\", highlighting \"the aggressivity involved in the effects of all regression, all arrested development, all rejection of typical development in the subject\". Neville Symington also saw narcissism as a key element in group conflict, singling out \"organizations so riven by narcissistic currents that...little creative work was done\". Such settings provide an opening for \"many egoistic instinct-feelings - as the desire to dominate and humiliate your fellow, the love of conflict - your courage and power against mine - the satisfaction of being the object of jealousy, the pleasures derived from the exercise of cunning, deceit and concealment\". Fischer (2012) distinguished between two forms of intragroup conflict in organizations. In a \"restorative\" form, paranoid-schizoid \"splitting\" can be transformed through scapegoating dynamics to produce reparative (\"depressive\") intragroup relations. In a contrasting \"perverse\" form, intragroup trauma causes paranoid-schizoid functioning to fragment, resulting in an intersubjective \"entanglement\" with sadomasochistic dynamics.\n\nNevertheless, psychoanalysts have not been able to evade the constraints of group conflict themselves: \"Envy, rivalry, power conflicts, the formation of small groups, resulting in discord and intrigue, are a matter of course\" in the psychoanalytic world, for example, with institutions being \"caught up in the factionalism of the ...struggle between the ins and the outs\".\n\nRené Girard saw \"collective violence as sacred...[as] the \"great remedy\" for communal life\". He saw the violence directed at the group scapegoat as \"absorbing all the internal tensions, feuds, and rivalries pent up within the community...a deliberate act of collective substitution\".\n\nHis view parallels the Freudian approach, rooted in \"Totem and Taboo\", which considers that \"transgression... is at the origin of a higher complexity, something to which the realm of civilization owes its development\". Freud saw violence as standing at the root of the social bond \"what prevails is no longer the violence of an individual but that of a community\" and thus \"politics made out of delinquency...the social contract establishes corporate virtue as an asylum for individual sin\".\n\nGirard concluded therefore that regression and 'the dissolution of differences encourages the proliferation of the double bind...spells the disintegration of social institutions', to reveal the group conflict latent at their core.\n\n\n"}

She is described as a secular conservative. She has advocated positions on numerous subjects including victimization, philanthropy, immigration reform, crime prevention, racism, racial profiling, rape, politics, welfare, and matters pertaining to cities and academia. Mac Donald is a Thomas W. Smith Fellow of the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor of New York's \"City Journal.\" She is a recipient of a 2005 Bradley Prize. She has written numerous editorials and is the author of several books. Born in California, she graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover in 1974 and from Yale (where she was in Berkeley College) in 1978. She then attended Cambridge and graduated from Stanford University Law School in 1985.\n\nMac Donald calls herself a secular conservative. She has argued that conservative thinking is superior to liberalism by virtue of the ideas alone, and that religion should not affect the argument and is unnecessary for conservatism. She has criticized the treatment of boys as a victim group, and criticized universities for seeking to hire \"diversity consultants\" to help boys succeed.\n\nMac Donald has criticized welfare and blamed philanthropic institutions such as the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation for suggesting that welfare is a right; in particular, she has criticized welfare because \"generations have grown up fatherless and dependent\". She has written that welfare programs serve as a \"dysfunction enabler\" and that food stamps cause an \"unhealthy dependence\". She has criticized American immigration policy as \"importing another underclass\", referring to Hispanics, which has the \"potential to expand indefinitely\".\n\nMac Donald has also argued that the reduction in crime in American cities since 1991 is a result of efficient policing, high incarceration rates, more police officers working, data-driven approaches such as CompStat in which police efforts target high-crime areas, and holding precinct commanders accountable for results. She has defended the Patriot Act and argued for secrecy and speed in handling problems as well as the sharing of information between departments within the intelligence community, and advocated that the benefits of government power be balanced against the risks of abuse. She has advocated for religious profiling by the police on the grounds that \"you cannot be an Islamic terrorist unless you're a member of the Muslim faith\". She has said that the Abu Ghraib prison scandal's fallout was overblown and that opponents of then-President Bush used it to construct an exaggerated \"master narrative\"; she said that Abu Ghraib was \"torture lite\" compared to more brutal atrocities, such as those of Pol Pot. She has defended the necessity of torture as an interrogation technique in selected circumstances.\n\nIn a break with some other conservatives, Mac Donald has criticized talk radio for fueling \"heightened rhetoric\" and argued that criticism of President Obama on talk radio programs was overdone. She views Obama as a moderate or \"standard-issue\" liberal, not a radical. She has also condemned conservative \"hate gestures\", such as an incident in which the doors and windows of Democrats who voted in favor of a health care bill were broken, as \"cowardly and juvenile\" acts.\n\nShe has been a very vocal critic of the Black Lives Matter movement, and was among the first to suggest a \"Ferguson effect\". She is also an outspoken critic of criminal justice reform, such as the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which she testified against in October 2015.\n\nIn a 2018 talk given at Hillsdale College, Mac Donald criticized the #MeToo social media movement, arguing that it is the latest in a long line of leftist victimhood culture \"frenzies.\" When asked by an audience member whether women who wear revealing bathing suits should share fault with their aggressors in cases of sexual assault, Mac Donald responded: “What you just did would be referred to as slut shaming... Good for you, because sluts should be shamed as far as I am concerned.” She also expressed her distaste for \"diversity,\" saying that it \"is prioritized over talent\" in the contemporary workplace.\n\nCritic Robin Finn of the \"New York Times\" has described Mac Donald as an \"influential institute thinker\". Columnist George F. Will praised her thinking about urban problems. \"New York Times\" critic Allen D. Boyer gave a positive review of her book \"The Burden of Bad Ideas\" (2000), writing that \"among discussions of urban malaise, where so much hot air has been recycled, this book has the freshness of a stiff, changing breeze\". Tim Lynch, the director of the Cato Institute's project on criminal justice, gave her 2016 book \"The War on Cops\" a negative review in \"Reason\", concluding, \"What Mac Donald calls a 'war on cops' is better described as a much-needed debate about crime, law enforcement tactics, and how to deal with systemic police misconduct,\" and adding, \"Conservatives have some worthwhile ideas to offer in this debate, but Mac Donald's polemics add heat, not light.\"\n\nIn spring 2017, a protest group announced plans to \"shut down\" Mac Donald's speech on the Black Lives Matter movement at a college campus in California, on the grounds that she is racist, fascist, and anti-black. On April 7, around 250 protesters surrounded audience members and prevented them from entering the building where she was speaking at Claremont McKenna College, whose president, Hiram Chodosh, afterward said, \"Based on the judgment of the Claremont Police Department, we jointly concluded that any forced interventions or arrests would have created unsafe conditions for students, faculty, staff, and guests.\" Mac Donald ultimately gave the talk to a small audience in the Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum that was live-streamed on Claremont McKenna's website. Chodosh added, \"In the end, the effort to silence her voice effectively amplified it to a much larger audience.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2553632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2553632", "title": "Hill figure", "text": "Hill figure\n\nA hill figure is a large visual representation created by cutting into a steep hillside and revealing the underlying geology. It is a type of geoglyph usually designed to be seen from afar rather than above. In some cases trenches are dug and rubble made from material brighter than the natural bedrock is placed into them. The new material is often chalk, a soft and white form of limestone, leading to the alternative name of chalk figure for this form of art.\n\nHill figures cut in grass are a phenomenon especially seen in England, where examples include the Cerne Abbas Giant, the Uffington White Horse, the Long Man of Wilmington, as well as the \"lost\" carvings at Cambridge, Oxford and Plymouth Hoe. From the 18th century onwards, many further ones were added. Many figures long thought to be ancient have been found to be relatively recent when subjected to modern archaeological scrutiny, at least in their current form. Only the Uffington White Horse appears to retain a prehistoric shape, while the Cerne Abbas Giant may be prehistoric, Romano-British, or Early Modern. Nevertheless, these figures, and their possible lost companions, have been iconic in the English people's conception of their past. \n\nThe creation of hill figures has been practised since prehistory and can include human and animal forms. Cutting of horses is common, as well as more abstract symbols and, in the modern era, advertising brands.\n\nThe reasons for the creation for the figures are varied and obscure. The Uffington Horse probably held political significance, since the figure dominates the valley below. It probably dates to the British Iron Age since coins have been found exhibiting the symbol. The Cerne Abbas Giant might have been a work of political satire. Wiltshire is a county with a large number of White Horses; 14 have been recorded. The figures are usually created by the cutting away of the top layer of relatively poor soil on suitable hillsides. This exposes the white chalk beneath, which contrasts well with the short green hill grass, and the image is clearly visible for a considerable distance. Despite most of the figures being of great age, many are relatively new. Devizes in Wiltshire created a large white horse for the 2000 Millennium celebrations and in October 2009 celebrated this with an aerial photo of volunteers making the figure 10 for an aerial photo.\n\nFigures must be maintained to remain visible, and local people often work regularly to restore or maintain a local landmark, though two cuttings of military badges at Sutton Mandeville, Wiltshire, are becoming lost. A map of Australia at Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire, was lost in 2005.\n\nSimilar pictures exist elsewhere in the world, notably the far larger Nazca Lines in Peru, which are on flat land but visible from hills in the area. However these were made in desert terrain rather than on grassy hillsides, so have not become overgrown and thus have survived much longer without maintenance. The Nazca Lines were formed by removing loose stones from the lines to expose the whiteish underlying soil, which is not itself dug.\n\nGeoglyph is the usual term for structures carved into or otherwise made from rock formations.\n\nIn 1949, Morris Marples \"half-humorously\" coined the words \"leucippotomy for the cutting of white horses and gigantotomy for the cutting of giants on rare occasions\". Though neither word appears in the Oxford English Dictionary, the terms occasionally appear in print.\n\nUntil recently, three methods were used to construct white hill figures.\n\n\nThe biggest threat to white horses and other hill figures is natural vegetation covering the figures. In the case of chalk figures, natural vegetation encroaches from the edges and can grow on soil washed onto the figure by rain. Water erosion can also be a problem on steep or gentle slopes, because rain can wash the chalk off the horse, or soil onto the horse. Larger horses are more susceptible to this. If chalk is washed off the horse, the horse gradually creeps down the slope; or if soil is washed onto the horse, it collects onto the lower edges and the horse gradually climbs up the slope. A solution is to provide drainage, either using run-off drains, as at Uffington White Horse, or a french ditch.\n\nWhile presumed to be of prehistoric origin, surviving examples may have been created only within the last four hundred years. Of these giants only two survive: one near the village of Cerne Abbas, to the north of Dorchester, in Dorset and one at Wilmington, Long Man civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex. Examples located at Oxford, Cambridge, and on Plymouth Hoe can no longer be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe Osmington White Horse carries a rider (King George III) but is not considered an example of gigantotomy due to the name of the figure referring to the horse.\n\nThe Cerne Abbas Giant, also referred to as the \"Rude Man\" or the \"Rude Giant\", is a hill figure of a giant naked man high, wide figure is carved into the side of a steep hill, and is best viewed from the opposite side of the valley or from the air. The carving is formed by a trench wide, and about the same depth, which has been cut through grass and earth into the underlying chalk. In his right hand the giant holds a knobbled club in length.\n\nIts history cannot be traced back further than the late 17th century, making an origin during the Celtic, Roman or even Early Medieval periods difficult to prove. Above and to the right of the Giant's head is an earthwork known as the \"Trendle\", or \"Frying Pan\". Medieval writings refer to this location as \"Trendle Hill\", but make no mention of the giant, leading to the conclusion that it was probably only carved about 400 years ago. In contrast, the Uffington White Horse an unquestionably prehistoric hill figure on the Berkshire Downs was noticed and recorded by medieval authors.\n\nIn 2008, overgrowth forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand.\n\nThe Long Man of Wilmington is a located on one of the steep slopes of Windover Hill, six miles (9.6 km) northwest of Eastbourne. The figure is 227 feet (69 m) tall and designed to look in proportion when viewed from below, and is shown holding two staves. The earliest record was made by the surveyor John Rowley in the year 1710. This drawing suggests that the original figure was a shadow or indentation in the grass, rather than the solid outline of a human figure. The staves were not depicted as a rake and scythe as was once thought, and the head was a helmet shape. Sir William Borrow's drawing of 1766 shows the figure holding a rake and a scythe, both shorter than the staves.\n\nBefore 1874, the Long Man's outline was only visible in certain light conditions as a different shade in the hillside grass, or after a light fall of snow. In that year an antiquarian marked out the outline with yellow bricks, later cemented together. It has been claimed that the 'restoration' process distorted the position of the feet, an assertion backed up by several who had been familiar with the figure before 1874, and also by later resistivity surveys.\nIt has also been suggested that it removed the Long Man's genitalia, though there is no historical or archaeological evidence which supports that claim. A wide range of dates of origin have been proposed for the Long Man, but more recent archaeological work done by the University of Reading suggests that the figure dates from the 16th or 17th century AD.\n\nUntil the early 17th century large outline images of the two giants, perhaps Gog and Magog (or Goemagot and Corineus) had for a long time been cut into the turf of Plymouth Hoe exposing the white limestone beneath. An early and explicit reference was made to them by Richard Carew in 1602. At one time these figures were periodically re-cut and cleaned but no trace of them remains today.\n\nFirle Corn in Firle, Sussex is a nearly-lost hill figure whose existence can be seen by infrared photography. Now looking more like a small ear of corn or a strange weapon than a human figure, there is a legend suggesting that a giant called Gill was once cut on this same hill and that he was considered an adversary of the Long Man of Wilmington not far away. According to one story, the giant on Firle Beacon threw his hammer at the Wilmington giant and killed him, and that the figure on the hillside marks the place where his body fell.\n\nAs a publicity stunt for the opening of \"The Simpsons Movie\" on 16 July 2007, a giant Homer Simpson brandishing a doughnut was outlined in water-based biodegradable paint to the left of the Cerne Abbas Giant. This act angered local neopagans, who pledged to perform \"rain magic\" to wash the figure away.\n\nThere are 16 known white horse hill figures in the UK, or 17 including the painted one at Cleadon Hills.\n\nThe Luzley White Horse near Mossley, cut in 1981, was neglected in 1992 after its creator died, but was not completely lost for some time.\n\nEight of the current white horses, and at least five of the lost figures, are in Wiltshire. The white horse is now generally considered a symbol of Wiltshire. An 1872 sketch of the Cherhill White Horse was later featured in the unofficial flag of Wiltshire, the White Horse Flag. It was designed after its designer, Chrys Fear, decided the white horse symbol had a stronger connection to Wiltshire than the Great Bustard on the official flag. Additionally, for the third millennium, it was proposed that a white horse should feature on one of the surrounding hills in Devizes (It became the Devizes Millennium White Horse). Smaller white horses now feature in Wiltshire, such as a replica of the Devizes White Horse in a Devizes primary school and two proposed white horses to feature on a roundabout in Marlborough (both towns already have larger white horses.) Liddington Hill near Swindon is the latest location in Wiltshire to have a proposed white horse, in the early 2000s, although the idea was abandoned.\n\nIf the names of the horses are not capitalised, it is because these are an adopted nickname, rather than a general consensus on its name or the official name.\n\nIf the names of the horses are not capitalised, it is because these are an adopted nickname, rather than a general consensus on its name or the official name.\n\nThe horses in Cockington Green, Georgia and Juárez are all based on the style of or direct copies of the Uffington White Horse.\n\nSince hill figures must be maintained by the removal of regrown turf, only those that motivate the local populace to look after them survive. Surviving ancient figures all have an associated fair or ceremony that involves maintaining them.\n\nUnmaintained figures gradually fade away. Firle Corn at Firle Beacon, Sussex could be a lost figure. Its existence is suggested by infrared photography. If it is a lost figure, its age is uncertain, and unlikely prehistoric in origin, as only one figure in the UK has been shown to be of this age, the Uffington White Horse.\n\nThere have been horses at Devizes and Pewsey, both in Wiltshire, that have been lost but replaced by new ones in the 20th century.\n\nThe white horses of Wiltshire, of which there are currently nine, have inspired other sculptures in the county. Julive Livsey's sculpture \"White Horse Pacified\" (1987) in Shaw, Swindon was inspired by the white horses. Furthermore, Charlotte Moreton created the steel sculpture \"White Horse\" (2010) for Solstice Park, Amesbury, taking influence from the white horses. A roundabout in Westbury, which features views of Westbury White Horse, features a canvas of the horse, with the horse also featuring in a mosaic in the town. When the county was choosing an official flag in 2006–07, a suggested nominee was the \"White Horse Flag\", featuring Cherhill White Horse. The Town Flag of Pewsey, registered in September 2014, features the Pewsey White Horse at its centre.\n\nIn England there are at least fifty landscape figures, the majority of which are in the south. (The phrase \"forensic photo\", relating to a few lost figures, refers to photos taken with appropriate filters, in optimum lighting, often at times of severe drought or snow covering, to bring out features no longer normally visible.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50310005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50310005", "title": "Inkshares", "text": "Inkshares\n\nInkshares is a publishing and literary rights-management platform founded in 2013. It is an open platform with a community of over 100,000 authors and readers. Authors post partial manuscripts which are sorted based on reader interest. Selected manuscripts are edited by Inkshares for publishing in North America, sale into foreign territories, and development in television and film.\n\nInkshares investors include Ingram Ventures, Indicator Ventures, and prominent angels in the media and entertainment space. Inkshares has strategic relationships with Ingram for North American book distribution and The United Talented Agency for representation and packaging in television and film.\n\nInkshares has been called “the future of publishing” by \"The Wall Street Journal\".\n\nInkshares was founded in 2013 by Thaddeus Woodman, Lawrence Levitsky, Adam Gomolin, and Jeremy Thomas. The original notion for Inkshares was developed by Woodman, whose parents founded a successful computer-book publishing company called Ventana Press in the 1990s. Spurred by the success of Kickstarter and the promise of the equity crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act, Woodman initially sought to create an equity crowdfunding portal for books.\n\nWoodman discussed the concept with Levitsky, a former founding vice president of RealNetworks, who had worked at Ventana Press with Woodman’s parents after running Microsoft Press. Levitsky introduced Woodman to Gomolin, a securities attorney and represented screenwriter. After the three raised a small $250k friend-and-family-round in late 2013, they hired Thomas as a co-founder and Chief Technical Officer.\n\nWoodman, Gomolin, and Levitsky raised a $250k friends-and-family round in late 2013. In the summer of 2014, Inkshares raised its first seed round with participation from Ingram Ventures (the venture arm of the largest book distributor in the world) and Indicator Ventures. The round also had participation from prominent publishing angels including Nion McEvoy, CEO of Chronicle Books.\n\nInkshares raised follow-on seed rounds in 2016 and 2017, including participation from 555 Capital and prominent Hollywood angels including Warner Brothers president of film and chief creative officer Greg Silverman.\n\nThe original notion presented by Woodman was to create a platform akin to “Kickstarter meets Random House” but complete with the ability to sell shares in a book so that readers could participate in the revenue stream for titles. At the time, while the Jobs Act had directed the SEC to create “equity crowdfunding,” the SEC had yet to promulgate rules, ultimately doing so multiple years late. Inkshares initially launched without the equity component, receiving extensive press in outlets including Fast Company and Publishers Weekly.\n\nThe original Inkshares model was premised on donations. Inkshares generated funding goals based on page length and projected design and print costs, and patrons could donate as much as they would like. Multiple successful projects were funded during this period, including \"The Astronaut Instruction Manual\" and \"The Show\".\n\nBeginning in 2015, Thomas, Woodman, and Gomolin moved the model from donations to pre-orders, starkly limiting the amount any one person could donate to a project. The first project to fund under this new model was \"Abomination\", the debut novel of Gary Whitta, screenwriter of The Book of Eli and Star Wars: Rogue One. Though this “pre-order” model made it harder for books to fund, Thomas, Woodman, and Gomolin believed that it would stop the type of vanity publishing that frequently occurred on Kickstarter and help map to genuine reader interest. During this period, Levitsky left the company to pursue his own imprint.\n\nIn late 2016, Inkshares began measuring non-monetary engagement such as shares, likes, and total times spent by readers on selected manuscripts. The first book published on the basis of engagement rather than pre-orders was \"Devil’s Call\" by J. Danielle Dorn.\n\nBy early 2016, Inkshares was experiencing significant growth in not just publishing but rights management. This had always been a significant focus for Gomolin, who had been represented in Hollywood and as Inkshares general counsel had written rights-management contracts into Inkshares’ first contracts in 2014. In 2015, Inkshares sold the streaming television rights for Filip Syta’s \"The Show\" to Blackpills in a large deal publicized by Business Insider. Immediately following this, Inkshares sold the audiobook rights to Penguin Random House in a six-figure deal that was rumoured to be the largest debut-author audio deal of the year. Later that year, Inkshares would sell Mike Mongo’s \"The Astronaut Instruction Manual\" to Legendary Entertainment and J-F Dubeau’s \"A God in the Shed\" to Skydance. Inkshares would follow these deals with myriad more sales in 2017, including the seven-figure deal for Tal Klein’s \"The Punch Escrow\", now in development at Lionsgate.\n"}

In addition, they have retained some traditional religious practices.\n\nIn 1971, following the Bangladesh Liberation War in which Bangladesh achieved independence, the country's majority Bengali Muslims began strategically colonising the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), which has displaced the Jumma people.

Between 1979 and 1997, Bengali Muslim settlers and the Bangladesh military carried out over 15 major massacres of Buddhist peoples in the CHT. Due to the outbreaks of violence, communal and social unrest, many fled to the Indian states of Mizoram and Tripura, or to Burma (now Myanmar). The Bangladesh government has also forcibly converted Marmas from Buddhism to Islam and destroyed Buddhist temples (kyaung), as means of integrating them into Bangladeshi society.

In maternity hospitals, a ratio of one IBCLC for every 15 postpartum mothers is suggested. The U.S. Surgeon General recommends that all communities ensure access to services provided by lactation consultants. Evidence found that breastfeeding interventions including lactation consultants and counselors increased the number of women initiating breastfeeding. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "40239786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40239786", "title": "Murder of Dwayne Jones", "text": "Murder of Dwayne Jones\n\nDwayne Jones was a Jamaican 16-year-old who was killed by a violent mob in Montego Bay in 2013, after he attended a dance party dressed in women's clothing. The incident attracted national and international media attention and brought increased scrutiny to the status of LGBT rights in Jamaica.\n\nPerceived as effeminate, Jones was bullied in school and, at the age of 14, was forced out of his family home by his father. He moved into a derelict house in Montego Bay with transgender friends. On the evening of 21 July 2013, they went to the Irwin area of the city and attended a dance party. When some men at the party discovered that the cross-dressing Jones was not a woman, they confronted and attacked him. Jones was beaten, stabbed, shot, and run over with a car; he died in the early hours of the morning. Police investigated the murder but did not arrest or charge anyone for the crime, which remains unsolved.\n\nThe event made newspaper headlines in Jamaica and was also the subject of reporting in both the United Kingdom and the United States. While voices on social media accused Jones of provoking his killers by cross-dressing in public, the murder was condemned by Jamaican educators and the country's Justice Minister. In the wake of the attack, both domestic and international organisations devoted to LGBT rights and human rights – among them Human Rights Watch, Jamaicans for Justice, and the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays – asked the Jamaican authorities for a proper investigation and legal recognition of LGBT rights on the island.\n\nRaised in an impoverished slum in Montego Bay, a city in northwest Jamaica, Jones faced bullying at high school from students who perceived his behaviour as effeminate. When Jones was 14, his father ejected him from the family home and encouraged neighbours to chase him out of the neighbourhood. After a period sleeping in bushes and on beaches, he began squatting in a derelict house in the hills above Montego Bay with two transgender friends, Keke and Khloe, both 23 at the time of Jones' death. Jones was known among friends as \"Gully Queen\", a reference to the storm drainage systems in which many homeless LGBT Jamaicans live. Friends noted that Jones desired to become a teacher or to work in the tourist industry. He also wanted to become a performer like the American pop star Lady Gaga, and had won a local dancing competition. Khloe described him as \"a diva\" who was \"always very feisty and joking around\".\n\nIn 2006, \"Time\" magazine said that Jamaica may be the most homophobic country in the world. The country's laws criminalising same-sex activity between males were introduced in 1864, during the British colonial administration. According to the Sexual Offences Act of 2009, any man convicted under these laws must register as a sex offender. These laws have been cited as contributing to wider homophobic attitudes among the Jamaican populace, including the view that gay people are criminals regardless of whether or not they have committed any criminal act. Anti-LGBT perspectives have been furthered by the island's conservative Christian churches. Many reggae and dancehall songs, among them Buju Banton's \"Boom Bye Bye\", call for the killing of gays. Writing for the \"International Business Times\" in the summer of 2013, the journalist Palash Gosh noted that while Jamaica was \"awash in crime and violence, gays and lesbians are particularly prominent targets of wanton brutality.\" In the mid-2000s, two of Jamaica's best-known LGBT rights activists, Brian Williamson and Steve Harvey, were murdered. In the summer of 2013, Human Rights Watch carried out five weeks of fieldwork among Jamaica's LGBT community, reporting that over half of those interviewed had experienced violence as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, sometimes on more than one occasion.\n\nOn the evening of 21 July 2013 – when Jones was 16 – he dressed in female clothing and attended a dance party with Keke and Khloe called Henessey Sundays, held at a bar in the Irwin area. They arrived by taxi at around 2 am. Jones passed as a girl at the party, and several males danced with him. Although he initially kept his biological sex a secret from others at the party, fearing homophobic persecution, he revealed his identity to a girl with whom he had previously been to church. The girl informed her male friends, who accosted him outside the venue, demanding to know, \"Are you a woman or a man?\" One of the men used a lantern to examine Jones' feet, claiming that they were too large to be those of a biological woman. Discovering his sex, they started calling him \"batty boy\" and other homophobic epithets. Khloe tried to get him to avoid confrontation, whispering in his ear, \"Walk with me, walk with me\", but Jones refused, instead insisting to those assembled that he was female.\n\nWhen someone pulled on Jones' bra strap, he ran away, and the crowd pursued and attacked him further down the road. He was beaten, stabbed, shot and run over by a car. He slipped in and out of consciousness for two hours before another attack finally killed him. There were no reports of anyone trying to help him during the altercation. Khloe was also attacked and almost raped, but escaped by hiding first in a church and then in neighbouring woods. Khloe commented, \"When I saw Dwayne's body, I started shaking and crying. It was horrible.\" Police arrived at the scene at 5 am to find the body dumped in bushes along Orange Main Road. They launched an investigation into the homicide, inviting friends and family of the victim to contact them. Jones' family declined to claim the body, and his father refused to talk to the press about the incident.\n\nOn 14 August, Deputy Superintendent of Police Steve Brown announced that fourteen statements had been collected and that the investigation was progressing. In October 2013, a group of men set fire to the place in which Jones had lived as a squatter, forcing its four occupants to flee, in what was also believed to be an anti-LGBT hate crime. Everald Morgan, an officer at the St James Public Health Department, requested that police provide protection for the four youths made homeless by the arson attack, but they declined to do so. Meanwhile, a charity named Dwayne's House was set up in Jones' memory to aid homeless LGBT youth in Jamaica. , however, no one had been arrested or charged, and in August 2015 the crime was still considered unsolved.\n\nJones' murder made headline news across Jamaica. Jamaica's Justice Minister, Senator Mark Golding, condemned the killing and called for an end to \"depraved acts of violence\" in Jamaica. He added that \"all well-thinking Jamaicans\" should embrace \"the principle of respect for the basic human rights of all persons\" and express tolerance towards minority groups such as the LGBT community. Annie Paul, the publications officer of the Jamaican campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI), stated that on the basis of comments provided on social media, she thought that most Jamaicans believed that Jones provoked his own murder by cross-dressing within a society that did not tolerate such behaviour. Newton D. Duncan, the UWI Professor of Paediatric Surgery, similarly noted that the \"overwhelming majority\" of Jamaicans believed that cross-dressers are homosexuals and deserve punishment. He added that this was a common misconception, because the majority of cross-dressers were heterosexual. He condemned the attack and compared it to the lynching of an African-American man in Harper Lee's novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", drawing links between the anti-LGBT violence of Jamaica and the anti-black violence of the mid-20th century United States.\n\nWriting in the Jamaican broadsheet \"The Gleaner\", Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, condemned the group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective use of the Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed it off with a humorous comment.\n\nJaevion Nelson, an HIV/AIDS campaigner and human rights advocate, also published an article on the subject in \"The Gleaner\". He noted that his initial reaction was to question why Jones had gone to the dance party and why he was not satisfied in attending Jamaica's underground gay parties. He added that he had subsequently realised that adopting this viewpoint was rooted in \"the culture of violence\" by which a victim is blamed for what happened to them. He called on Jamaicans to be tolerant of LGBT individuals, and to focus on \"rebuilding this great nation on the principles of inclusivity, love, equality and respect with no distinctions whatsoever\". Also in \"The Gleaner\", Sheila Veléz Martínez, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, condemned the murder as \"alarming evidence\" of the high rates of homophobia in Jamaican society.\n\nOn 25 July, the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals & Gays (J-FLAG), an LGBT rights organisation, issued a public statement expressing their \"deep concern\" regarding the case, and offering their condolences to Jones' friends and family. They encouraged local people to aid the police in locating the perpetrators of the attack, which they asserted was an affront to Jamaica's democracy. J-FLAG's director Dane Lewis later commented that despite an increase in homophobic violence, Jamaican society was becoming more tolerant toward LGBT people; he attributed this to the actions of individuals like Jones, who have helped improve the public visibility of LGBT people in Jamaican society. Another LGBT rights organisation, Quality of Citizenship Jamaica, issued a press release calling for the government and churches to engage with LGBT organisations to establish common ground which could be undergirded by the principle of \"true respect for all,\" found in the nation's National Anthem. Human rights organisation Jamaicans for Justice called on Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and religious leaders to condemn the murder, also commenting on what they saw as a lack of media coverage and public outrage about the incident, adding that \"we must ask ourselves what this says about us as a people.\"\n\nNews of Jones' murder attracted international media attention, resulting in condemnation of the killing by human rights groups. Graeme Reid, the LGBT Rights Program director at Human Rights Watch in New York, issued a statement that the Jamaican government should send an \"unequivocal message\" that there would be \"zero tolerance\" of anti-LGBT violence. Reid noted that Jamaica's Prime Minister had vowed to decriminalise same-sex sexual activity in her 2011 election campaign but had yet to implement that promise. He encouraged the Jamaican authorities to take action to investigate Jones' murder and to promote respect for the country's LGBT citizens.\n\nIn a February 2014 briefing, the U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, Uzra Zeya, cited Jones' case as well as the torture and murder of Cameroonian HIV/AIDS activist Eric Ohena Lembembe as examples of the \"troubling acts of violence\" against LGBT individuals that had happened across the globe in the previous year.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in association with the Peter Tatchell Foundation, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August. Talking to press, the OPDG's Marvin Kibuuka condemned Jones' murder and called for supporters to actively oppose the persecution of LGBT people in both Jamaica and elsewhere. Peter Tatchell later asserted that the lack of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was tantamount to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT hate crime.\n\nIn her introduction to an academic study of \"queerness and children's literature\", Laura Robinson, an Associate Professor of English at the Royal Military College of Canada, cited Jones' murder alongside the 2013 Russian LGBT propaganda law as an example in which youth issues intersected with LGBT issues. She added that Jones was a \"child who did not end up having what Judith Butler calls a 'livable life'.\"\n\n"}

They have approximately 130,000 speakers primarily in eastern Afghanistan and a few adjacent valleys in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Chitral District, Pakistan. The region inhabited by the Nuristanis is located in the southern Hindukush mountains, and is drained by Alingar River in the west, Pech River in the center, and Landai Sin and Kunar River in the east. The languages were previously often grouped with Indo-Aryan or Iranian until they were finally classified as forming a third branch in Indo-Iranian.\n\n\nThe Nuristani languages were not described in literature until the 19th century. The older name for the region was Kafiristan and the languages were termed Kafiri or Kafiristani, but the terms have been replaced by the present ones since the conversion of the region to Islam in 1896.\n\nThere are four different theories about the origins of the Nuristani languages and their place within the Indo-Iranian languages:\nThe languages are spoken by tribal peoples in an extremely isolated mountainous region of the Hindu Kush, one that has never been subject to any real central authority in modern times. This area is located along the northeastern border of present-day Afghanistan and adjacent portions of the northwest of present-day Pakistan. These languages have not received the attention linguists would like to give them. Considering the very small number of peoples estimated to speak them, they must be considered endangered languages.\n\nMany Nuristani people now speak other languages, such as Dari and Pashto (two official languages of Afghanistan) and Chitrali in Pakistan.\n\nThe earliest divergence of Nuristani from the other Indo-Iranian languages may be indicated by the fact that the Ruki sound law does not apply after *u: e.g. Kam-viri /muˈsə/ 'mouse'.\n\nNuristani shares with Iranian the merger of the plain and breathy voiced consonants, and the fronting of the Proto-Indo-Iranian primary palatal consonants. The latter were retained as dental affricates in Proto-Nuristani, in contrast to simplification to sibilants (in most of Iranian) or interdentals (in Persian). Later on *dz has however shifted to /z/ in all Nuristani varieties other than Kam-viri and Tregami.\n\nMany Nuristani languages have subject–object–verb (SOV) word order, like most of the other Indo-Iranian languages, and unlike the adjacent Dardic Kashmiri language, which has verb-second word order.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the largest fire service motorcycle club in the world.\n\nMembership is open to all firefighters: active, retired, volunteer, professional or industrial, who have access to a motorcycle and hold a valid motorcycle driver's license.\n\nDuring the summer of 1982, several firefighters met in Randy's Cycle Shop in Boylston, Massachusetts, United States. They discussed the fact that police officers had established their own motorcycle club, the Blue Knights, but there was still no motorcycle club for firefighters. B owner Randy Wilson said to Ed Wright, a firefighter from Northboro, Massachusetts, that he should stop talking about it and establish a motorcycle club. Wright made some hand-made cards to invite firefighters from the region. He planned to organize a meeting to determine whether there was enough interest to start a motorcycle club. \n\nOn August 17, 1982, Fire Chief Jack Pierce allowed a small group of avid motorcycle riding firefighters to meet in the headquarters of the Fire Department for the purpose of starting a club.\n\nOn October 19, 1982, firefighters Colin Mackey, Bob Bourassa, Ed Wright, Roger Wentzell, Dave Hamilton, Bob Goulet, David Hunt, Jon Tripp, Don Parker, Norm Beausoleil and Fire Chief Jack Pierce met again. It was decided that the club would be called the \"Red Knights Motorcycle Club\" and the first chapter would be Massachusetts 1.\n\nIn July 1983, a chapter was founded in Connecticut. In October of that year, a second chapter in Massachusetts was founded. Soon there were startups in remote locations such as Nevada and Louisiana. In August 1983, the founding members realized that the organization had quickly exceeded their original expectations. To properly handle this growth they elected a board of directors, the National Board of Directors. With the founding of chapters in Ontario and Saskatchewan, the club was the renamed the \"Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club\".\n\nThere are now 350 chapters and over 9,800 members worldwide.\n\nRKMC membership types include:\n\nAny active or retired firefighting personnel who holds a valid driver's license for motorcycles and has access to a motorcycle can be an active members in RKMC member. A firefighter belonging to a professional, work, military, airport, or volunteer fire department can be a member. EMS personnel may also be included if they are employed by a fire department.\n\nThis membership is granted to any member who joins a new chapter within the first year of its existence.\n\nA sibling, spouse or partner, children aged 16 years or older, and the parents of active members may join as social members.\n\nChildren and grandchildren of active and associate members, up to 16 years of age, can join as junior members.\n\nAssociate membership can be offered to a person who has contributed to the promotion of the Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club® Inc. for a minimum period of six months. Final approval shall be by a majority vote of the chapter members at a meeting held at the conclusion of the six-month period.\n\nThis membership is available to anyone who qualifies as an active member who chooses not to be a member of a chapter.\n\nTo form a chapter, there must be a minimum of seven active members. Each chapter elects its own board. Board positions (officers) are President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and Road Captain. The President and Vice President must be an active member, and the other three positions are available to all members. Only the Secretary and Treasurer position can be held by one member.\n\nSeveral chapters may join together to form a state/provincial or regional association. The state/provincial associations exists predominantly in the U.S and Canada. Currently there are two regional associations. The first brought together the chapters in Australia and New Zealand, and the second brought together the chapters in Europe.\n\nThe memorial is located in Boylston, Massachusetts near the local fire station, where in 1982 the RKMC was founded. In 2002, RKMC Massachusetts Chapter 1 began preparations for the site. On August 18, 2007, the memorial was officially opened. In addition to a memorial stone which commemorates the founding of the RKMC, there is also a memorial with the names of all deceased RKMC members.\n\nIn 2011, the Board of the International RKMC received a piece of World Trade Center steel from the Port Authority of New York. The piece bears the numbers 149 and C-N-176, which indicates that it came from the area of impact between the 94th and 98 floors of WTC Tower 1. An honor guard escorted the steel from New York to Boylston.

Almost all important party leaders were present to hear Hitler declare the ongoing destruction of the Jewish race, yet it remains less known than the later Wannsee Conference.\n\nThe announcement Hitler made on 12 December to the \"Reichsleiter\" and \"Gauleiter\" refers to an earlier statement he had made on 30 January 1939:\n\nWith the entry of Japan and the United States into the Second World War on 7 December 1941 and the resulting declaration of war on the US by Nazi Germany on 11 December, the war, especially in regard to the above statement, had become truly a \"World War\". Hitler announced this declaration of war on 11 December in the German \"Reichstag\", a speech also broadcast on radio. On 12 December 1941, he had a meeting with the most important Nazi leaders.\n\nOn the afternoon of 12 December, Hitler ordered the leading members of the Nazi Party to a meeting in his private rooms at the Reich Chancellery. Because the meeting took place in private rooms rather than Hitler's office, no official record of it exists. However, entries in the diaries of Joseph Goebbels and Hans Frank confirm it. Goebbels made the following entry in his diary for 12 December:\nApart from the fact that the European war had turned into a world war, another reason for this shift must be seen in the fact that the entry of the United States into the war meant that the Jewish population had lost its value for Hitler as hostages deterring the United States from becoming an active member of the Allied coalition, and he was finally free to act according to his long-term plans. \n\nHitler's presence at the Chancellery meeting undermines claims that he was ignorant of the Holocaust and that it was carried out by subordinates without his knowledge.\n\nThe meeting marked a turning point in the Nazi regime's attitude towards the Jewish people. It was part of a shift from propaganda, intimidation and attacks to outright and planned extermination. The latter step had already been taken in some parts of Eastern Europe as early as August 1941. The much more well-known Wannsee Conference in January 1942 marked the next step in the Nazis' plans to exterminate the Jews.\n\nAttendance in this meeting was obligatory for Nazis in high party offices. No official list of the people who attended this meeting exists, but the following leaders of Nazi Germany, out of the about 50 present, are known to have been there:\n\nKnown to have been absent from this meeting were Hermann Göring and probably Reinhard Heydrich. Neither one of them held a party office.\n\n\n"}

Presently, not all ethnic Shors speak Shor, and the language suffered a decline from the late 1930s to the early 1990s. During this period the Shor language was neither written nor taught in schools. However, the dissolution of the Soviet Union brought about the Shor language revival. The language is now taught at the Novokuznetsk branch of the Kemerovo State University.\n\nLike its neighbor languages, Shor has borrowed many roots from Mongolian, as well as words from Russian. The two main dialects are Mrassu and Kondoma, named after the rivers in whose valleys they are spoken. From the point of view of classification of Turkic languages, these dialects belong to different branches of Turkic: According to the reflexes of the Proto-Turkic (PT) intervocalic -d- in modern languages (compare PT *adak, in modern Turkic languages meaning 'foot' or 'leg'), the Mrassu dialect is a -z- variety: azak, the Kondoma dialect is a -y- variety: ayak. This feature normally distinguishes different branches of Turkic which means that the Shor language has formed from different Turkic sources.\n\nEach Shor dialect has subdialectal varieties. The Upper-Mrassu and the Upper-Kondoma varieties have developed numerous close features in the course of close contacts between their speakers in the upper reaches of the Kondoma and Mrassu rivers.\n\nThe Mrassu dialect served as a basis for literary Shor language both in the 1930s and in the 1980s when the written form of the Shor language was revitalized after almost of 50 years of break in its written history. However, the Kondoma dialect norms are also largely accepted.\n\nShor was first written with a Cyrillic alphabet introduced by Christian missionaries in the middle of the 19th century. After a number of changes, the modern Shor alphabet is written in another modified Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nIn 2005, to highlight the endangered status of the language, Gennady Kostochakov published a book of poems in Shor, entitled \"I am the Last Shor Poet\". In 2017,\n\nShor has seven personal pronouns:\n\nBefore the 19th century the Shor language had remained unwritten; in the 1870s Orthodox missionaries made the first effort to create a Cyrillic Shor alphabet. In spite of all the efforts by the missionaries, the percentage of literacy among the native population increased very slowly — by the beginning of the 20th century they constituted only about 1% of the Shors.\n\nThe Shor written language had its 'golden age' in the 1920s. In 1927, a second attempt was made to create a Shor alphabet based on Cyrillic. In 1932-1933, Fedor Cispijakov wrote and published a new primer based on the Latin alphabet. This however considerably complicated the process of learning; thus in 1938, the same author together with Georgij Babuskin created a new variant of the primer based on the Cyrillic alphabet, of which several editions have been published since then.\n\nThe first book written in the Shor language was published in 1885.\nIt used a modified Russian alphabet (excluding Ё ё, Ф ф, Щ щ, and Ѣ ѣ) with additional letters Ј ј, Ҥ ҥ, Ӧ ӧ, and Ӱ ӱ.\n\nIn 1927 an official alphabet was adopted, being the Russian alphabet (excluding Ё ё and ъ) with additional letters Ј ј, Ҥ ҥ, Ӧ ӧ, and Ӱ ӱ.\n\nA Latin alphabet for the Shor language was introduced in 1930: A a, B в, C c, D d, Ə ə, F f, G g, Ƣ ƣ, I i, J j, K k, Q q, M m, N n, N̡ n̡, O o, Ө ө, P p, R r, S s, T t, U u, V v, Ş ş, Z z, Ƶ ƶ, L l, Ь ь, Y y, Į į.\n\nThe order of the letters was later changed to correspond with alphabets for other languages in the Soviet Union, the letter Ә ә was replaced with E e, and the letter Į į was dropped.\n\nIn 1938 the Latin alphabet was replaced with a Cyrillic one. It used the Russian alphabet with additional letters Ӧ ӧ, Ӱ ӱ, and Нъ нъ.\nAfter reforms in 1980 it reached its present form: А а, Б б, В в, Г г, Ғ ғ, Д д, Е е, Ё ё, Ж ж, З з, И и, Й й, К к, Қ қ, Л л, М м, Н н, Ң ң, О о, Ӧ ӧ, П п, Р р, С с, Т т, У у, Ӱ ӱ, Ф ф, Х х, Ц ц, Ч ч, Ш ш, Щ щ, Ъ ъ, Ы ы, Ь ь, Э э, Ю ю, Я я.\n\n\n"}

Split custody is generally chosen because it creates a situation in which children do not have to constantly travel back and forth between their parent's homes and it creates a situation in which siblings that do not get along can be separated.\n\nSplit custody arrangements are criticized for a number of reasons. One such reason is that the siblings are separated from each other, which also has the negative aspect of eliminating the emotional support they give one another. Additionally, in this form of arrangement, this effect could be compounded by the fact that they have one primary parent, which has been shown to cause distress in children.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "946812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=946812", "title": "Systematic risk", "text": "Systematic risk\n\nIn finance and economics, systematic risk (in economics often called aggregate risk or undiversifiable risk) is vulnerability to events which affect aggregate outcomes such as broad market returns, total economy-wide resource holdings, or aggregate income. In many contexts, events like earthquakes and major weather catastrophes pose aggregate risks that affect not only the distribution but also the total amount of resources. If every possible outcome of a stochastic economic process is characterized by the same aggregate result (but potentially different distributional outcomes), the process then has no aggregate risk.\n\nSystematic or aggregate risk arises from market structure or dynamics which produce shocks or uncertainty faced by all agents in the market; such shocks could arise from government policy, international economic forces, or acts of nature. In contrast, specific risk (sometimes called residual risk, unsystematic risk, or idiosyncratic risk) is risk to which only specific agents or industries are vulnerable (and is uncorrelated with broad market returns). Due to the idiosyncratic nature of unsystematic risk, it can be reduced or eliminated through diversification; but since all market actors are vulnerable to systematic risk, it cannot be limited through diversification (but it may be insurable). As a result, assets whose returns are negatively correlated with broader market returns command higher prices than assets not possessing this property.\n\nIn some cases, aggregate risk exists due to institutional or other constraints on market completeness. For countries or regions lacking access to broad hedging markets, events like earthquakes and adverse weather shocks can also act as costly aggregate risks. Robert Shiller has found that, despite the globalization progress of recent decades, country-level aggregate income risks are still significant and could potentially be reduced through the creation of better global hedging markets (thereby potentially becoming idiosyncratic, rather than aggregate, risks). Specifically, Shiller advocated for the creation of macro futures markets. The benefits of such a mechanism would depend on the degree to which macro conditions are correlated across countries.\n\nSystematic risk plays an important role in portfolio allocation. Risk which cannot be eliminated through diversification commands returns in excess of the risk-free rate (while idiosyncratic risk does not command such returns since it can be diversified). Over the long run, a well-diversified portfolio provides returns which correspond with its exposure to systematic risk; investors face a trade-off between expected returns and systematic risk. Therefore, an investor's desired returns correspond with their desired exposure to systematic risk and corresponding asset selection. Investors can only reduce a portfolio's exposure to systematic risk by sacrificing expected returns.\n\nAn important concept for evaluating an asset's exposure to systematic risk is beta. Since beta indicates the degree to which an asset's return is correlated with broader market outcomes, it is simply an indicator of an asset's vulnerability to systematic risk. Hence, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) directly ties an asset's equilibrium price to its exposure to systematic risk.\n\nConsider an investor who purchases stock in many firms from most global industries. This investor is vulnerable to systematic risk but has diversified away the effects of idiosyncratic risks on his portfolio value; further reduction in risk would require him to acquire risk-free assets with lower returns (such as U.S. Treasury securities). On the other hand, an investor who invests all of his money in one industry whose returns are typically uncorrelated with broad market outcomes (beta close to zero) has limited his exposure to systematic risk but, due to lack of diversification, is highly vulnerable to idiosyncratic risk.\n\nAggregate risk can be generated by a variety of sources. Fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policy can all be sources of aggregate risk. In some cases, shocks from phenomena like weather and natural disaster can pose aggregate risks. Small economies can also be subject to aggregate risks generated by international conditions such as terms of trade shocks.\n\nAggregate risk has potentially large implications for economic growth. For example, in the presence of credit rationing, aggregate risk can cause bank failures and hinder capital accumulation. Banks may respond to increases in profitability-threatening aggregate risk by raising standards for quality and quantity credit rationing to reduce monitoring costs; but the practice of lending to small numbers of borrowers reduces the diversification of bank portfolios (concentration risk) while also denying credit to some potentially productive firms or industries. As a result, capital accumulation and the overall productivity level of the economy can decline.\n\nIn economic modeling, model outcomes depend heavily on the nature of risk. Modelers often incorporate aggregate risk through shocks to endowments (budget constraints), productivity, monetary policy, or external factors like terms of trade. Idiosyncratic risks can be introduced through mechanisms like individual labor productivity shocks; if agents possess the ability to trade assets and lack borrowing constraints, the welfare effects of idiosyncratic risks are minor. The welfare costs of aggregate risk, though, can be significant.\n\nUnder some conditions, aggregate risk can arise from the aggregation of micro shocks to individual agents. This can be the case in models with many agents and strategic complementarities; situations with such characteristics include: innovation, search and trading, production in the presence of input complementarities, and information sharing. Such situations can generate aggregate data which are empirically indistinguishable from a data-generating process with aggregate shocks.\n\nThe following example is from Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995). Consider a simple exchange economy with two identical agents, one (divisible) good, and two potential states of the world (which occur with some probability). Each agent has expected utility in the form formula_1 where formula_2 and formula_3 are the probabilities of states 1 and 2 occurring, respectively. In state 1, agent 1 is endowed with one unit of the good while agent 2 is endowed with nothing. In state 2, agent 2 is endowed with one unit of the good while agent 1 is endowed with nothing. That is, denoting the vector of endowments in state \"i\" as formula_4 we have formula_5, formula_6. Then the aggregate endowment of this economy is one good regardless of which state is realized; that is, the economy has no aggregate risk. It can be shown that, if agents are allowed to make trades, the ratio of the price of a claim on the good in state 1 to the price of a claim on the good in state 2 is equal to the ratios of their respective probabilities of occurrence (and, hence, the marginal rates of substitution of each agent are also equal to this ratio). That is, formula_7. If allowed to do so, agents make trades such that their consumption is equal in either state of the world.\n\nNow consider an example with aggregate risk. The economy is the same as that described above except for endowments: in state 1, agent 1 is endowed two units of the good while agent 2 still receives zero units; and in state 2, agent 2 still receives one unit of the good while agent 1 receives nothing. That is, formula_8, formula_6. Now, if state 1 is realized, the aggregate endowment is 2 units; but if state 2 is realized, the aggregate endowment is only 1 unit; this economy is subject to aggregate risk. Agents cannot fully insure and guarantee the same consumption in either state. It can be shown that, in this case, the price ratio will be less than the ratio of probabilities of the two states: formula_10, so formula_11. Thus, for example, if the two states occur with equal probabilities, then formula_12. This is the well-known finance result that the contingent claim that delivers more resources in the state of low market returns has a higher price.\n\nWhile the inclusion of aggregate risk is common in macroeconomic models, considerable challenges arise when researchers attempt to incorporate aggregate uncertainty into models with heterogeneous agents. In this case, the entire distribution of allocational outcomes is a state variable which must be carried across periods. This gives rise to the well-known curse of dimensionality. One approach to the dilemma is to let agents ignore attributes of the aggregate distribution, justifying this assumption by referring to bounded rationality. Den Haan (2010) evaluates several algorithms which have been applied to solving the Krusell and Smith (1998) model, showing that solution accuracy can depend heavily on solution method. Researchers should carefully consider the results of accuracy tests while choosing solution methods and pay particular attention to grid selection.\n\n"}

{"id": "10215531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10215531", "title": "Urban hierarchy", "text": "Urban hierarchy\n\nThe Urban hierarchy ranks each city based on the size of population residing within the nationally defined statistical urban area. Because urban population depends on how governments define their metropolitan areas, urban hierarchies are conventionally ranked at the national level; however, the ranking can be extended globally to include all cities. Urban hierarchies tell us about the general organization of cities and yield some important insights. First, it tells us that within a system of cities, some cities will grow to be very large, but that number will be small relative to the universe of cities. Second, it refutes the expectation of an optimally sized city. Lastly, it establishes cities as belonging to an inter-related network where one city's growth affects others'.\n\nThe hierarchy is usually related to the empirical regularity with which cities are distributed. The pattern has been formulated in a number of ways, but usually as a variation of the power law. Formally, it is a frequency distribution of rank data where frequency is inversely proportional to rank such that cities with population larger than \"S\" are approximately proportional to \"S\", where \"a\" is normally close to 1. There are no good explanations for the exponent consistently being close to 1. This is problematic because an exponent of 1 in the power law implies an infinite population. Paul Krugman proposes that, in the case of cities, the power law operates according to the percolation theory. This relaxes the condition on the exponent approaching the value of 1 and breaking down the model. Importantly, the application of a percolation model leads to one of the key insights regarding city sizes: geography and economic conditions give cities advantages that allow them to grow more than cities with a relative scarcity of these benefits. \nA simpler formulation of the relationship between rank and frequency is expressed with reference to Zipf's Law. The law applied to cities states that \"if cities are ranked in decreasing population size, then the rank of a given city will be inversely proportional to its population.\" According to this intuitive formulation, in a country where the largest city has a population of 10 million, the second largest will have population size of 5 million, the third largest 3 .33 million, etc.\n\nThe urban hierarchy has been described in detail in the United States where the power law has held consistently for over a century. In 1991, there were 40 U.S. Metropolitan Areas with population above 1 million, 20 above 2 million, and 9 with more than 4 million.\n\nRecent advances in data collection have allowed researchers to test the theoretical distribution against global data. Shlomo Angel finds that the pattern holds remarkably well for a global sample of 3,646 cities. The predicted distribution based on Zipf's law and the actual distribution are virtually identical. The most common size ranges from 100,000 to 200,000 and constitutes about half of the entire sample. The distribution extends to the largest cities with population over 2.5 million.\n\nWhile the frequency distribution of urban hierarchies is empirically simple, the set of factors that create it are complex and no individual explanation can account for the distribution. The unequal distribution of city sizes and lack of convergence on one equilibrium size are relatively well understood. Henderson's model of urban system relies on three sets of factors that influence the size of cities: land inputs, labor, and capital. The model formally relates the benefits of economies of agglomeration and congestion cost. Cities benefit from economies of scale that attract firms and workers, making them larger. But, the limited supply of land means that the price of locating near the center of production increases as the population size increases. Eventually, the greater costs lead to diminishing returns to scale and cities tend towards an optimal equilibrium size, assuming they all share the same attributes. Henderson relaxed the assumption of identical cities to explore the implications of a diversified economy of traded goods. The extension of the model underlies the urban system literature and gives rise to the finding that cities will differ in size to account for the factor rewards associated with traded goods of varying degrees of return to scale and intensity of land use.\n\nWhile the pattern of urban hierarchy tends to conform to the power law, it is not universal. Especially at the country level, we observe significant deviations from the theoretical distribution. Countries with a primate city, a city that dominates in population size and, usually, economically, have a deficit of intermediate size cities. Examples of primate cities include Paris in France, London in the United Kingdom, and Tokyo in Japan. The history of these countries play a large role in the persistence of their primate city. Particularly, the concentration of political power in one city early on has a large degree of path dependency.\n"}
