It is also informally known as the \"Acadian Reunion\". Its creator was André Boudreau (1945-2005).\n\nThe first congress was held in Moncton, New Brunswick in 1994, and the second was held in south Louisiana from July 31 to August 15, 1999. The 1999 event featured the reunions of over 80 Acadian families, three major concerts (Houma, Oak Alley Plantation, and Lafayette Cajundome), and academic conferences centered on economics, culture, women's issues, genealogy and genetics. The President and executive director of the 1999 event was Brian Gabriel Comeaux of Lafayette, LA.\n\nThe third congress, in 2004, was held jointly by several Nova Scotia communities in the ancestral Acadie region, and celebrated the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first French-speaking settlers in Canada. As in the previous gatherings, musical festivals and theatrical productions displayed Acadian culture, and academics debated the meaning of Acadia in the 21st century. Debate topics included the best ways of preserving Acadian culture in an overwhelmingly English area, and what exactly an Acadian is in 2004. Some Acadians in the Maritimes do not recognize more recent immigrants as true Acadians. There was also a debate about whether the descendants of Acadians, who do not speak French, qualify (see Chiac language).\n\nThe 2009 Acadian World Congress was held in the Acadian Peninsula.\n\nThe 2014 Acadian World Congress was held along the Canada–United States border, co-hosted by Maine's Aroostook County in the United States and its neighbouring counties in Canada (Témiscouata in Quebec, and Victoria, Madawaska and Restigouche in New Brunswick).\n\nThe 2019 Congress is planned to be held on Prince Edward Island and in New Brunswick, with its central events being held in Summerside. \n\n"}

{"id": "4506407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4506407", "title": "Arabic coffee", "text": "Arabic coffee\n\nArabic coffee (, ) refers to a version of the brewed coffee of \"Coffea arabica\" beans. Arabic coffee is typically grown at a height of 1000 to 2000 meters, and represents about 60-70% of the coffee industry in the world. Most Arab countries throughout the Middle East have developed unique methods for brewing and preparing coffee. Cardamom is an often-added spice, but it can alternatively be served plain ().\n\nThere are mainly two types of Arabic coffee; one with a golden colour made mainly in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region, and the other is black.\n\nThere are several different styles to brewing the coffee depending on the preference of the drinker. Some methods keep the coffee light, which usually contains cardamom, whereas others can make it dark. Arabic coffee is bitter, and typically no sugar is added. It is usually served in a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finjān. Culturally, Arabic coffee is served during family gatherings or when receiving guests.\n\nArabic coffee is ingrained within Middle Eastern and Arab culture and tradition, and is the most popular form of coffee brewed in the Middle East. It originated in the Middle East, beginning in Yemen and eventually travelling to Mecca (Hejaz), Egypt, the Levant, and then, in the mid-16th century, to Turkey. Arabic coffee is an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Arab states confirmed by UNESCO.\n\nThe word \"coffee\" entered the English language in 1582 via the Dutch \"koffie\", borrowed from the Ottoman Turkish \"kahve\", in turn borrowed from the Arabic قَهْوَة (qahwa, “coffee, a brew”). The word \"qahwah\" may have originally referred to the drink's reputation as an appetite suppressant from the word \"qahiya\" (). The name \"qahwah\" is not used for the berry or plant (the products of the region), which are known in Arabic as \"bunn\". Semitic had a root \"qhh\" \"dark color\", which became a natural designation for the beverage. According to this analysis, the feminine form \"qahwah\" (also meaning \"dark in color, dull(ing), dry, sour\") also had the meaning of wine, which was also often dark in color.\n\nThe earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in Yemen's Sufi monasteries. Sufis used it to keep themselves alert during their nighttime devotions. A translation of Al-Jaziri's manuscript traces the spread of coffee from \"Arabia Felix\" (the present day Yemen) northward to Mecca and Medina, and then to the larger cities of Cairo, Damascus, Baghdad, and Constantinople. In 1511, it was forbidden for its stimulating effect by conservative, orthodox imams at a theological court in Mecca. However, these bans were to be overturned in 1524 by an order of the Ottoman Turkish Sultan Suleiman I, with Grand Mufti Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi issuing a \"fatwa\" allowing the consumption of coffee. In Cairo, Egypt, a similar ban was instituted in 1532, and the coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee beans were sacked.\n\nArabic coffee is made from coffee beans roasted very lightly or heavily from and cardamom, and is a traditional beverage in Arab culture. Traditionally, it is roasted on the premises (at home or for special occasions), ground, brewed and served in front of guests. It is often served with dates, dried fruit, candied fruit or nuts. Arabic coffee, is defined by the method of preparation and flavors, rather than the type or roast beans. Arabic coffee is boiled coffee that is not filtered, made black. Sugar is not typically added, but if so, it can be added during preparation or when serving. It is served in a small delicate cup without handles, called finjān. Sometimes, the coffee is moved to a larger and more beautiful pour pitcher to serve in front of the guests, called Della. Often, though, the host prepares coffee in the kitchen and highlights a tray of small cups of coffee. Unlike its Turkish counterparts, traditional Arabic coffee, with its roots in Bedouin tradition, is usually unsweetened (qahwah saada), but sugar can added depending on the preference of drinker. However, this coffee is never sweet syrup, but rather strong and bitter. To make up for the bitter flavor, coffee is usually served with something sweetdates are a traditional accompanimentand other desserts are often served along with a tray of coffee cups.\"Coffee should be black as hell, strong as death, and sweet as love.\" - Turkish Proverb\n\nArabs in the Gulf are also creative in the way they prepare coffee. Coffee is different from that in Egypt and Levant in terms of bitterness and the type of cups the coffee is served in. This brewing method is common in Najd and Hejaz, and sometimes other spices like saffron (to give it a golden color), cloves, and cinnamon. Some people add a little-evaporated milk to slightly alter its color; however, this is rare. It is prepared in and served from a special coffee pot called dallah (); more commonly used is the coffee pot called cezve (also called rikwah or kanaka) and the coffee cups are small with no handle called \"fenjan\". The portions are small, covering just the bottom of the cup. It is served in homes, and in good restaurants by specially clad waiters called \"gahwaji\", and it is almost always accompanied with dates. It is always offered with the compliments of the house.\nThe hot beverage that Palestinians consume is coffeeserved in the morning and throughout the day. The coffee of choice is usually Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to Turkish coffee, but the former is spiced with cardamom and is usually unsweetened. Among Bedouins and most other Arabs throughout the region of Palestine, bitter coffee, known as \"qahwah sadah\" (Lit. plain coffee), was a symbol of hospitality. Pouring the drink was ceremonial; it would involve the host or his eldest son moving clockwise among guestswho were judged by age and statuspouring coffee into tiny cups from a brass pot. It was considered \"polite\" for guests to accept only three cups of coffee and then end their last cup by saying \"daymen\", meaning \"always\", but intending to mean \"may you always have the means to serve coffee\".\n\nIn Lebanon, the coffee is prepared in a long-handled coffee pot called \"rakwe\". Coffee is poured directly from \"rakwe\" to a small cup that is adorned with a decorative pattern, known as a finjān. The finjān has a capacity of 60-90 ml (2-3 oz fl). Lebanese coffee is traditionally strong and black and is similar to the coffee of other Middle Eastern countries. However it differs in its beans and roast, where the blonde and dark beans are mixed together. It is also ground into a very particle like size. It is often joked that a Lebanese person who does not drink coffee is in danger of losing their nationality. \n\nDrinks in Syria vary depending on the time of day and the occasion. Arabic coffee is the most well-known hot drink usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food.\n\nArabic coffee is much more than just a drink in Jordanit is a traditional sign of respect and a way to bring people together. Black, cardamom-flavored Arabic coffee, also known as \"qahwah sādah\" (welcome coffee), deeply ingrained in Jordanian culture. Providing coffee (and tea) to guests is a large part of the intimate hospitality of the Hashemite Kingdom.\n\nArabic coffee is the national drink of Morocco, it is often made with the purpose of conducting a business deal, bargaining or welcoming someone into their home.\n\nMuch of the popularization of coffee is due to its cultivation in the Arab world, beginning in what is now Yemen, by Sufi monks in the 15th century. Through thousands of Arabs pilgrimaging to Mecca, the enjoyment and harvesting of coffee, or the \"wine of Araby\" spread to other Arab countries (e.g. Egypt, Syria) and eventually to a majority of the world through the 16th century. Coffee, in addition to being essential in the home, became a major part of social life. Coffeehouses, qahwa قَهوة in Modern Standard Arabic, became \"Schools of the Wise\" as they developed into places of intellectual discussion, in addition to centers of relaxation and comradery.\n\nCoffeehouse culture began in the Arab world, and eventually spread to other areas of the world and blended with the local culture. Traditional Arab coffeehouses are places where mostly men meet to socialize over games, coffee, and water pipes (shisha or agriile). Depending on where the coffeehouse is, its specialty differs. In Maghreb, green tea is served with mint or coffee is served Arab and/or European style. Arabic coffee, or Turkish coffee, is made in Egypt and the Levant countries. Arabic coffee is a very small amount of dark coffee boiled in a pot and presented in a demitasse cup. Particularly in Egypt, coffee is served mazbuuta, which means the amount of sugar will be \"just right\", about one teaspoon per cup. However, in the Arabian Peninsula, Arabic coffee is roasted in such a way that the coffee is almost clear. In all of the Arab world, it is traditional for the host to refill the guest's cup until politely signaled that the guest is finished.\n\nArabic coffee is usually served just a few centiliters at a time. The waiter/host serves the guest just enough to cover the bottom of the cup. Usually, the coffee is boiling hot, so larger amounts would take too long to cool to a drinkable temperature. The guest drinks it and if he wishes, he will gesture to the waiter not to pour any more. Otherwise, the host/waiter will continue to serve another few centilitres at a time until the guest indicates he has had enough. The most common practice is to drink only one cup since serving coffee serves as a ceremonial act of kindness and hospitality. Sometimes people also drink larger volumes during conversations.\n\nThe cups are normally only filled partway, and the custom is to drink three cups. Arabic coffee has a prominent place in traditional Arab holidays and special events such as Ramadan and Eid.\n\nArabic coffee reading (), is similar to tea-leaf reading; the client is asked to consume strong fresh Arabic coffee leaving approximately a teaspoon of liquid in the cup. The cup is then inverted onto a saucer to allowing the residual liquid to drain away. The reader will then interpret the patterns formed by the thick residue on the inside of the cup.\n\nIn Arabic funerals gather families and extended relatives, who drink bitter and unsweetened coffee and restore the life and characteristics of the deceased., the men and women gather separately, it has become very fashionable to employ very presentable women whose only job is to serve coffee all day to the women. Male waiters serve the men. Arab Muslims and Christians share this tradition.\n\nA small cup of Arabic coffee has almost no calories or fat. It contains a small amount of protein.\n\n"}

It was one of the Gainsborough melodramas and is based on a novel \"Caravan\" by Eleanor Smith.\n\nIn late 19th-century London, destitute Richard Darrell (Stewart Granger) rescues Don Carlos (Gerard Heinz) from two robbers. When Richard returns for the manuscript he inadvertently left behind, he is encouraged by Don Carlos to talk about his background. The son of a poor country doctor, he met the upper class Oriana Camperdene and Francis Castleton during their childhood; he and Francis became rivals for Oriana's affections. Oriana and her father left for Spain, but the couple were reunited as adults and agreed to marry, much to Francis's disgust. However, they postponed the wedding for a year so that Richard could go to London and make his fortune as a writer. However, though he has completed a novel, no one wants to publish it and his year is almost up. Don Carlos offers to publish it and asks him to take a valuable necklace, which once belonged to Queen Isabella of Castile, to Granada. \n\nBidding farewell to Oriana (Anne Crawford), Richard sets out. On the way, he meets Wycroft (Robert Helpmann), who assaults, robs and nearly kills Richard on behalf of his dastardly master, Sir Francis Castleton (Dennis Price). Oriana thinks Richard is dead and, with her father recently dead, marries Francis, whilst Richard loses his memory as a result of the assault and marries a gypsy girl named Rosal (Jean Kent). However, everyone meets again...\n\n\nThe film was meant to follow \"The Magic Bow\", but that was postponed due to the illness of Phyllis Calvert so, \"Caravan\" had to be rushed into production.\n\nLocation filming took place in North Wales.\n\nJean Kent met her future husband during the making of the movie.\n\nThe film was one of the most popular British releases of 1946.

In the book, Harrold intertwines his personal experiences living and working in the country with the recent history of Korea.\n\nIn the early days, Harrold enjoyed his important status and the accompanying trappings of his work in North Korea. In addition to revising the words of President Kim Il Sung, he was given a prominent position at ceremonial events. Moreover, he was relatively well-paid.

{"id": "14688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14688", "title": "Demographics of Israel", "text": "Demographics of Israel\n\nThe demographics of Israel are monitored by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. The State of Israel has a population of approximately 8,855,000 inhabitants as of the first half of 2018. Some 74.5% are Jews of all backgrounds (about 6,556,000 individuals), 20.9% are Arab of any religion other than Jewish (about 1,837,000 individuals), while the remaining 4.6% (about 400,000 individuals) are defined as \"others\", including persons of Jewish ancestry deemed non-Jewish by religious law and persons of non-Jewish ancestry who are family members of Jewish immigrants (neither of which are registered at the Ministry of Interior as Jews), Christian non-Arabs, Muslim non-Arabs and all other residents who have neither an ethnic nor religious classification.\n\nIsrael's annual population growth rate stood at 2.0% in 2015, more than three times faster than the OECD average of around 0.6%. With an average of three children per woman, Israel also has the highest fertility rate in the OECD by a considerable margin and much higher than the OECD average of 1.7.\n\nGenerally, population trends in Israel reflect distinct patterns of two sub-groups: Jews (around 74.71% of the population) and Arabs (20.7%). Over the past decade, the Muslim annual population growth has fallen significantly, from around 3% to less than 2.2% by 2013, while the overall Jewish growth rate rose from around 1.4% to 1.7%, primarily due to the expanding Orthodox Jewish sector.\n\nThe territory of Israel can be defined in a number of ways as a result of a complex and unresolved political situation (see table below). For example, whilst the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics defines the area of Israel to include the annexed East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, and to exclude the militarily controlled regions of the West Bank, the CBS defines the population of Israel to also include Israeli settlers living in the Area C of West Bank and the Muslim residents of East Jerusalem and Area C, who have Israeli residency or citizenship.\n\nWithin Israel's system of local government, an urban municipality can be granted a city council by the Israeli Interior Ministry when its population exceeds 20,000. The term \"city\" does not generally refer to local councils or urban agglomerations, even though a defined city often contains only a small portion of an urban area or metropolitan area's population.\n\nThe most prominent ethnic and religious groups, who live in Israel at present and who are Israeli citizens or nationals, are as follows:\n\nAccording to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2008, of Israel's 7.3 million people, 75.6 percent were Jews of any background. Among them, 70.3 percent were Sabras (born in Israel), mostly second- or third-generation Israelis, and the rest are olim (Jewish immigrants to Israel)—20.5 percent from Europe and the Americas, and 9.2 percent from Asia and Africa, including the Arab countries.\n\nThe paternal lineage of the Jewish population of Israel as of 2015 is as follows:\n\nThe 2009 survey by the Guttman Center found the following distribution:\n\nFertility rates between secular and religious Jewish groups also differ significantly.\n\nArab citizens of Israel are those Arab residents of Mandatory Palestine, who remained within Israel's borders following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and the establishment of the state of Israel. It is including those born within the state borders subsequent to this time, as well as those who had left during the establishment of the state (or their descendants), who have since re-entered by means accepted as lawful residence by the Israeli state (primarily family reunifications).\n\nIn 2006, the official number of Arab residents in Israel was 1,413,500 people, about 20 percent of Israel’s population. This figure includes 209,000 Arabs (14% of the Israeli Arab population) in East Jerusalem, also counted in the Palestinian statistics, although 98 percent of East Jerusalem Palestinians have either Israeli residency or Israeli citizenship.\n\nMost Arab citizens of Israel are Muslim, particularly of the Sunni branch of Islam. A small minority are Ahmadiyya sect and there are also some Alawites (affiliated with Shia Islam) of Ghajar with Israeli citizenship. As of 2008, Arab citizens of Israel comprised just over 20 percent of the country's total population. About 82.6 percent of the Arab population in Israel was Sunni Muslim (with a very small minority of Shia), another 9 percent was Druze, and around 9 percent was Christian (mostly Eastern Orthodox and Catholic denominations).\n\nThe Arab Muslim citizens of Israel include also the Bedouins, who are divided into two main groups: the Bedouin in the north of Israel, who live in villages and towns for the most part, and the Bedouin in the Negev, who include half-nomadic and inhabitants of towns and Unrecognized villages. According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as of 1999, 110,000 Bedouins live in the Negev, 50,000 in the Galilee and 10,000 in the central region of Israel. The vast majority of Arab Bedouins of Israel practice Sunni Islam.\n\nThe Ahmadiyya community was first established in the region in the 1920s, in what was then Mandatory Palestine. Israel is the only country in the Middle East, where Ahmadi Muslims can openly practice their faith, which is not recognized as part of Islam by most Sunni and Shi'a denominations. As such, Kababir, a neighbourhood on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel, acts as the Middle East headquarters of the Community. It is unknown how many Israeli Ahmadis there are, although it is estimated there are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir alone.\n\nAs of December 2013, about 161,000 Israeli citizens practiced Christianity, together comprising about 2% of the total population. The largest group consists of Melkites (about 60% of Israel's Christians), followed by the Greek Orthodox (about 30%), with the remaining ca. 10% spread between the Roman Catholic (Latin), Maronite, Anglican, Lutheran, Armenian, Syriac, Ethiopian, Coptic and other denominations. \n\nSome 1,000 Israeli citizens belong to the Coptic community, originated in Egypt.\n\nThe Arab citizens of Israel include also the Druze who were numbered at an estimated 129,800 at the end of 2011. All of the Druze living in what was then British Mandate Palestine became Israeli citizens after the declaration of the State of Israel. Though a few individuals identify themselves as \"Palestinian Druze\", the vast majority of Druze do not consider themselves to be 'Palestinian', and consider their Israeli identity stronger than their Arab identity. Druze serve prominently in the Israel Defense Forces, and are represented in mainstream Israeli politics and business as well, unlike Muslim Arabs who are not required to and generally choose not to serve in the Israeli army.\n\nIn 2014, Israel has decided to recognize the Aramaic community within its borders as a national minority, allowing some of the Christians in Israel to be registered as \"Aramean\" instead of \"Arab\". As of October 2014, some 600 Israelis requested to be registered as Arameans, with several thousand eligible for the status - mostly members of the Maronite community.\n\nThe Maronite Christian community in Israel of around 7,000 resides mostly in the Galilee, with a presence in Haifa, Nazareth and Jerusalem. It is largely composed of families that lived in Upper Galilee in villages such as Jish long before the establishment of Israel in 1948. In the year 2000, the community was joined by a group of Lebanese SLA militia members and their families, who fled Lebanon after 2000 withdrawal of IDF from South Lebanon.\n\nThere are around 1,000 Assyrians living in Israel, mostly in Jerusalem and Nazareth. Assyrians are an Aramaic speaking, Eastern Rite Christian minority who are descended from the ancient Mesopotamians. The old Syriac Orthodox monastery of Saint Mark lies in Jerusalem. Other than followers of the Syriac Orthodox Church, there are also followers of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church living in Israel.\n\nThe Samaritans are an ethnoreligious group of the Levant. Ancestrally, they claim descent from a group of Israelite inhabitants who have connections to ancient Samaria from the beginning of the Babylonian Exile up to the beginning of the Common Era. 2007 population estimates show that 712 Samaritans live half in Holon, Israel and half at Mount Gerizim in the West Bank. The Holon community holds Israeli citizenship, while the Gerizim community resides at an Israeli controlled enclave, holding dual Israeli-Palestinian citizenship.\n\nAbout 4,000 Armenians reside in Israel mostly in Jerusalem (including in the Armenian Quarter), but also in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jaffa. Armenians have a Patriarchate in Jerusalem and churches in Jerusalem, Haifa and Jaffa. Although Armenians of Old Jerusalem have Israeli identity cards, they are officially holders of Jordanian passports.\n\nIn Israel, there are also a few thousand Circassians, living mostly in Kfar Kama (2,000) and Reyhaniye (1,000). These two villages were a part of a greater group of Circassian villages around the Golan Heights. The Circassians in Israel enjoy, like Druzes, a \"status aparte\". Male Circassians (at their leader's request) are mandated for military service, while females are not.\n\nEthnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians, immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who were eligible to emigrate due to having, or being married to somebody who has, at least one Jewish grandparent and thus qualified for Israeli citizenship under the revised Law of Return. A number of these immigrants also belong to various ethnic groups from the Former Soviet Union such as Armenians, Georgians, Azeris, Uzbeks, Moldovans, Tatars, among others. Some of them, having Jewish father or grandfather identify as Jews, but being non-Jewish by Halakha (Jewish religion law), they are not recognized formally as Jews by state. Most of them are in the mainstream of Israel culture and are called \"expanded Jewish population\". In addition, a certain number of former Soviet citizens, primarily women of Russian and Ukrainian ethnicity, emigrated to Israel, after marrying Muslim or Christian Arab citizens of Israel, who went to study in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nAlthough most people of Finnish origin in Israel are Finnish Jews who immigrated to Israel, and their descendants, a small number of Finnish Christians moved to Israel in the 1940s before the independence and gained citizenship following independence. For the most part, many of the original Finnish settlers intermarried with the other communities in the country, and therefore remain very small in number. A Moshav shitufi near Jerusalem named Yad HaShmona, meaning the \"Memorial for the Eight\", was established in 1971 by a group of Finnish Christian-Israelis, although today, most members are Israeli, and are predominantly Hebrew speakers, and the moshav has become a center of so-called \"Messianic Jews\".\n\nThe Bahá'í population in Israel is almost entirely made up of volunteers serving at the Bahá'í World Centre. Bahá'u'lláh (1817-1892), the Faith's founder, was banished to Akka and died nearby where his shrine is located. During his lifetime he instructed his followers not to teach and convert those living in the area, and the Bahá'ís descending from those original immigrants were later asked to leave and teach elsewhere. For nearly a century there has been a policy by Shoghi Effendi and later the Universal House of Justice to not accept converts from Israel. The 650 or so foreign national Bahá'ís living in Israel are almost all on temporary duty serving at the shrines and administrative offices. A fluctuating segment of Baha'is consists of pilgrims.\n\nThe number of Vietnamese people in Israel and their descendants is estimated at 150 to 200. Most of them came to Israel in between 1976–1979, after prime minister Menachem Begin authorized their admission to Israel and granted them political asylum. The Vietnamese people living in Israel are Israeli citizens who also serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Today, the majority of the community lives in the Gush Dan area in the center of Tel Aviv, but also a few dozen Vietnamese-Israelis or Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in Haifa, Jerusalem, and Ofakim.\n\nThe African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem is a small spiritual group of African Americans, whose members believe they are descended from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. With a population of over 5,000, most members live in their own community in Dimona, Israel, with additional families in Arad, Mitzpe Ramon, and the Tiberias area. At least some of them consider themselves to be Jewish, but mainstream scholarship does not consider them to be of Israelite but of subsaharan African origin. Their ancestors were African Americans who after several years in Liberia migrated to Israel in the late 1960s and demanded that Israel give them citizenship in the state. When Israel refused, they relinquished their United States citizenship and de facto became stateless. After some deliberation, the Israeli government granted them citizenship. The African Hebrew Israelites, like the Haredim and most Israeli Arabs, are not required to serve in the military; however, some do so, and they do receive social benefits from the state, including free health care. Most believe in a kind of Paleo-Judaism based on the Torah without the Oral Laws; however, at least one member of the community underwent a conversion to Orthodox Judaism.\n\nSome naturalized foreign workers and their children born in Israel, predominantly from the Philippines, Nepal, Nigeria, Senegal, Romania, China, Cyprus, Thailand, and South America (mainly Colombia).\n\nThe number and status of African migrants in Israel is disputed and controversial, but it is estimated that at least 70,000 refugees mainly from Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Ivory Coast reside and work in Israel. A count in late 2011 published in Ynet pointed out the number only in Tel Aviv is 40,000, which represents 10 percent of the city's population. The vast majority is living at the southern parts of the city. There is a significant population in the southern Israeli cities of Eilat, Arad, and Beersheba.\n\nThere are around 300,000 foreign workers, residing in Israel under temporary work visas, including Palestinians. Most of those foreign workers engage in agriculture and construction. The main groups of those foreign workers include the Chinese, Thai, Filipinos, Nigerians, Romanians, and Latin Americans.\n\nApproximately 100–200 refugees from Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraqi Kurdistan, and North Korea were absorbed in Israel as refugees. Most of them were also given Israeli resident status, and currently reside in Israel. As of 2006, some 200 ethnic Kurdish refugees from Turkey resided in Israel as illegal immigrants, fleeing the Turkey-PKK conflict.\n\nDue to its immigrant nature, Israel is one of the most multicultural and multilingual societies in the world. Hebrew is the official language of the country, and Arabic is given special status, while English and Russian are the two most widely spoken non-official languages. A certain degree of English is spoken widely, and is the language of choice for many Israeli businesses. Courses of Hebrew and English language are mandatory in the Israeli school system, and most schools offer either Arabic, French, Spanish, German, Italian, or Russian.\n\nAccording to a 2010 Israel Central Bureau of Statistics study of Israelis aged over 18, 8% of Israeli Jews define themselves as \"Haredim\" (or ultra-Orthodox); an additional 12% are \"religious\" (non-Haredi Orthodox, also known as: dati leumi/national-religious or religious Zionist); 13% consider themselves \"religious-traditionalists\" (mostly adhering to Jewish Halakha); 25% are \"non-religious traditionalists\" (only partly respecting the Jewish Halakha), and 43% are \"secular\". Among the seculars, 53% say they believe in God. Due to the higher birth rate of religious and traditionalists over seculars, their share among the overall population is growing as time passes.\n\nWhile the ultra-Orthodox, or Haredim, represented only 5% of Israel's population in 1990, they are expected to represent more than one-fifth of Israel's Jewish population by 2028.\n\nEducation between ages 5 and 15 is compulsory. It is not free, but it is subsidized by the government, individual organizations (such as the Beit Yaakov System), or a combination. Parents are expected to participate in courses as well. The school system is organized into kindergartens, 6-year primary schools, and either 6-year secondary schools or 3-year junior secondary schools + 3-year senior secondary schools (depending on region), after which a comprehensive examination is offered for university admissions.\n\nAs Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state relies upon maintenance of a Jewish demographic majority, Israeli demographers, politicians, and bureaucrats have treated Jewish population growth promotion as a central question in their research and policymaking. Non-Jewish population growth and immigration is regarded as a threat to the Jewish demographic majority, and to Israel's security , as detailed in the Koenig Memorandum.\n\nIsrael is the thirty-fourth most-densely crowded country in the world. In an academic article, Jewish National Fund Board member Daniel Orenstein, argues that, as elsewhere, overpopulation is a stressor on the environment in Israel; he shows that environmentalists have conspicuously failed to consider the impact of population on the environment, and argues that overpopulation in Israel has not been appropriately addressed for ideological reasons.\n\nThe Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order) 5763 was first passed on 31 July 2003, and has since been extended until 31 July 2008. The law places age restrictions for the automatic granting of Israeli citizenship and residency permits to spouses of Israeli citizens, such that spouses who are inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza Strip are ineligible. On 8 May 2005, the Israeli ministerial committee for issues of legislation once again amended the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, to restrict citizenship and residence in Israel only to Palestinian men over the age of 35, and Palestinian women over the age of 25. Those in favor of the law say the law not only limits the possibility of the entrance of terrorists into Israel, but, as Ze'ev Boim asserts, allows Israel \"to maintain the state's democratic nature, but also its Jewish nature\" (i. e., its Jewish demographic majority). Critics, including the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, say the law disproportionately affects Arab citizens of Israel, since Arabs in Israel are far more likely to have spouses from the West Bank and Gaza Strip than other Israeli citizens.\n\nIn the constitutional challenges to the Citizenship and Entry to Israel Law, the state, represented by the Attorney General, insisted that security was the only objective behind the law. The state also added that even if the law was intended to achieve demographic objectives, it is still in conformity with Israel's Jewish and democratic definition, and thus constitutional. In a 2012 ruling by the Supreme Court on the issue, some of the judges on the panel discussed demography, and were inclined to accept that demography is a legitimate consideration in devising family reunification policies that violate the right to family life.\n\nDuring the 1970s about 163,000 people of Jewish descent immigrated to Israel from the USSR.\n\nLater Ariel Sharon, in his capacity as Minister of Housing & Construction and member of the Ministerial Committee for Immigration & Absorption, launched an unprecedented large-scale construction effort to accommodate the new Russian population in Israel so as to facilitate their smooth integration and encourage further Jewish immigration as an ongoing means of increasing the Jewish population of Israel. Between 1989 and 2006, about 979,000 Jews emigrated from the former Soviet Union to Israel.\n\n\n\"Note:\" includes over 200,000 Israelis and 250,000 Arabs in East Jerusalem, about 421,400 Jewish settlers on the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), and about 42,000 in the Golan Heights (July 2007 est.). Does not include Arab populations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Does not include 222,000 foreigners living in the country.\n\nTotal:\n\nJews:\n\nArab:\n\n\nThe Jewish median age in Jerusalem district and the West Bank are 24.9 and 19.7, respectively, and both account for 16% of the Jewish population, but 24% of 0–4 year olds. The lowest median age in Israel, and one of the lowest in the world, is found in two of the West Bank's biggest Jewish cities: Modi'in Illit (11), Beitar Illit (11) followed by Bedouin towns in the Negev (15.2).\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Jewish population growth rate was about 3% per year, as a result of massive immigration to Israel, primarily from the republics of the former Soviet Union. There is also a very high population growth rate among certain Jewish groups, especially adherents of Orthodox Judaism. The growth rate of the Arab population in Israel is 2.2%, while the growth rate of the Jewish population in Israel is 1.7%. The growth rate of the Arab population has slowed from 3.8% in 1999 to 2.2% in 2013, and for the Jewish population, the growth rate declined from 2.7% to its lowest rate of 1.4% in 2005, before picking up since then to 1.7%.\n\nIV/2016-III/2017\n\n\nBirths, in absolute numbers, by mother's religion\nCurrent natural population growth\n\n\nBetween the mid-1980s and 2000, the fertility rate in the Muslim sector was stable at 4.6–4.7 children per woman; after 2001, a gradual decline became evident, reaching 3.51 children per woman in 2011. By point of comparison, in 2011, there was a rising fertility rate of 2.98 children among the Jewish population.\n\nBirths and deaths \n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2012) (Estimates) :\n\n\nThere were a total of 38,666 deaths in 2006. (39,026 in 2005 & 37,688 in 2000). Of this 33,568 were Jews (34,031 in 2005 & 33,421 in 2000). 3,078 were Muslims (2,968 in 2005 & 2,683 in 2000). 360 were Druze (363 in 2005 & 305 in 2000). 712 were Christian (686 in 2005 & 666 in 2000).\n\n\nThere were a total of 26,500 immigrants who made Aliyah to Israel in 2014: 11,430 from the Former Soviet Union, 7,000 from France, 3,470 from the United States, 620 from the United Kingdom, 620 from Colombia, 400 from Canada, 340 from Italy, 300 from Brazil, 297 from Argentina, 240 from Belgium, 232 from Eastern Europe (including 126 from Hungary), 200 from Australia and New Zealand, 190 from South Africa, 120 from Germany, 76 from Mexico, 70 from Venezuela, 58 from Uruguay, and 52 from Chile.\n\nFor many years definitive data on Israeli emigration was unavailable. In \"The Israeli Diaspora\" sociologist Stephen J. Gold maintains that calculation of Jewish emigration has been a contentious issue, explaining, \"Since Zionism, the philosophy that underlies the existence of the Jewish state, calls for return home of the world's Jews, the opposite movement—Israelis leaving the Jewish state to reside elsewhere—clearly presents an ideological and demographic problem.\"\n\nIn the past several decades, emigration (yerida) has seen a considerable increase. From 1990 to 2005, 230,000 Israelis left the country; a large proportion of these departures included people who initially immigrated to Israel and then reversed their course (48% of all post-1990 departures and even 60% of 2003 and 2004 departures were former immigrants to Israel). 8% of Jewish immigrants in the post-1990 period left Israel, while 15% of non-Jewish immigrants did. In 2005 alone, 21,500 Israelis left the country and had not yet returned at the end of 2006; among them 73% were Jews, 5% Arabs, and 22% \"Others\" (mostly non-Jewish immigrants, with Jewish ancestry, from USSR). At the same time, 10,500 Israelis came back to Israel after over one year abroad; 84% were Jews, 9% Others, and 7% Arabs.\n\nAccording to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, as of 2005, 650,000 Israelis had left the country for over one year and not returned. Of them, 530,000 are still alive today. This number does not include the children born overseas. It should also be noted that Israeli law grants citizenship only to the first generation of children born to Israeli emigrants.\n\nGeographic deployment:\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage life expectancy at age 0 of the total population.\nJewish total fertility rate increased by 10.2% during 1998–2009, and was recorded at 2.90 during 2009. During the same time period, Arab TFR decreased by 20.5%. Muslim TFR was measured at 3.73 for 2009. During 2000, the Arab TFR in Jerusalem (4.43) was higher than that of the Jews residing there (3.79). But as of 2009, Jewish TFR in Jerusalem was measured higher than the Arab TFR (2010: 4.26 vs 3.85, 2009: 4.16 vs 3.87). TFR for Arab residents in the West Bank was measured at 2.91 in 2013, while that for the Jewish residents was reported at 5.10 children per woman.\n\nThe ethnic group with highest recorded TFR is the Bedouin of Negev. Their TFR was reported at 10.06 in 1998, and 5.73 in 2009. TFR is also very high among Haredi Jews. For Ashkenazi Haredim, the TFR rose from 6.91 in 1980 to 8.51 in 1996. The figure for 2008 is estimated to be even higher. TFR for Sephardi/Mizrahi Haredim rose from 4.57 in 1980 to 6.57 in 1996.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge 15 and over can read and write (2011 estimate):\n\nIn June 2013, the Central Bureau of Statistics released a demographic report, projecting that Israel's population would grow to 11.4 million by 2035, with the Jewish population numbering 8.3 million, or 73% of the population, and the Arab population at 2.6 million, or 23%. This includes some 2.3 million Muslims (20% of the population), 185,000 Druze, and 152,000 Christians. The report predicts that the Israeli population growth rate will decline to 1.4% annually, with growth in the Muslim population remaining higher than the Jewish population until 2035, at which point the Jewish population will begin growing the fastest.\n\nIn 2017, the Central Bureau of Statistics projected that Israel's population would rise to about 18 million by 2059, including 14.4 million Jews and 3.6 million Arabs. Of the Jewish population, about 5.25 million would be ultra-Orthodox Jews. Overall, the forecast projected that 49% of the population would be either ultra-Orthodox Jews (29%) and Arabs (20%). It also projected a population of 20 million in 2065.\n\nOther forecasts project that Israel could have a population as high as 23 million, or even 36 million, by 2050.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "1342299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1342299", "title": "Diseases of affluence", "text": "Diseases of affluence\n\nDiseases of affluence is a term sometimes given to selected diseases and other health conditions which are commonly thought to be a result of increasing wealth in a society. Also referred to as the \"Western disease\" paradigm, these diseases are in contrast to so-called \"diseases of poverty\", which largely result from and contribute to human impoverishment. These diseases of affluence have vastly increased in prevalence since the end of World War II.\n\nExamples of diseases of affluence include mostly chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and other physical health conditions for which personal lifestyles and societal conditions associated with economic development are believed to be an important risk factor — such as type 2 diabetes, asthma, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, hypertension, cancer, alcoholism, gout, and some types of allergy. They may also be considered to include depression and other mental health conditions associated with increased social isolation and lower levels of psychological well being observed in many developed countries. Many of these conditions are interrelated, for example obesity is thought to be a partial cause of many other illnesses.\n\nIn contrast, the diseases of poverty have tended to be largely infectious diseases, or the result of poor living conditions. These include tuberculosis, asthma, and intestinal diseases. Increasingly, research is finding that diseases thought to be diseases of affluence also appear in large part in the poor. These diseases include obesity and cardiovascular disease and, coupled with infectious diseases, these further increase global health inequalities.\n\nDiseases of affluence started to become more prevalent in developing countries as diseases of poverty decline, longevity increases, and lifestyles change. In 2008, nearly 80% of deaths due to NCDs — including heart disease, strokes, chronic lung diseases, cancers and diabetes — occurred in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO) the top 10 causes of deaths in the high income countries/ affluent countries in 2016 were from\n\n\nExcept for the lower respiratory infections all of them are non-communicable diseases. In 2016 WHO reported 56.9 million deaths worldwide, and more than half (54%), were due to the top causes of death previously mentioned.\n\nFactors associated with the increase of these conditions and illnesses appear to be things that are a direct result of technological advances. They include:\n\nDiabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by increase blood glucose level. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes. It is caused by resistance to insulin or the lack of production of insulin. It is seen most commonly in adults. Type 1 diabetes or juvenile diabetes affects mostly children. This condition is due to little or lack of insulin production from the pancreas.\n\nAccording to WHO the prevalence of diabetes has quadrupled from 1980 to 422 million adults. The global prevalence of diabetes has increased from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014. Diabetes has been a major cause for blindness, kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and lower limb amputation.\n\nThe Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report in 2015 indicating that more than 100 million Americans have diabetes or pre-diabetes. Diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in United States in 2015. In developed countries like the United States, the risk for diabetes is seen in people with low socioeconomic status (SES). Socioeconomic status is defined by the education and the income level of a person. The prevalence of diabetes varies by education level. Of those diagnosed with diabetes:12.6% of adults had less than a high school education, 9.5% had a high school education and 7.2% had more than high school education.\n\nDifferences in diabetes prevalence are seen in the population and ethnic groups in USA. Diabetes is more common in non-Hispanic whites, who are less educated and have a lower income. It is also more common in less educated Hispanics. The highest prevalence of diabetes is seen in the southeast, southern and Appalachian portion of the United States. In the United States the prevalence of diabetes is increasing in children and adolescents. In 2015, 25 million people were diagnosed with diabetes, of which 193,000 were children. The total direct and indirect cost of diagnosed diabetes in US in 2012 was $245 billion.\n\nIn 2009, the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) estimated that diagnosed diabetes will increase from 1.3 million in 2000 to 2.5 million in 2010 and 3.7 million in 2020. Diabetes was the 7th leading cause of death in Canada in 2015. Like United States, diabetes in more prevalent in the low socioeconomic group of people in Canada.\n\nAccording to the International Diabetes Federation, more than 58 million people are diagnosed with diabetes in the European Union Region (EUR), and this will go up to 66.7 million by 2045. Similar to other affluent countries like America and Canada, diabetes is more prevalent in the poorer parts of Europe like Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn Australia according to self-reported data, 1 in 7 adults or approximately 1.2 million people had diabetes in 2014-2015. People who were living in remote or socioeconomically disadvantaged areas were 4 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as compared to non-indigenous Australians. Australia incurred $20.8 million in direct costs towards hospitalization, medication, and out-patient treatment towards diabetes. In 2015, $1.2 billion were lost in Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) due to diabetes.\n\nIn these countries of affluence, diabetes is prevalent in low socioeconomic groups of people as there is abundance of unhealthy food choices, high energy rich food, and decreased physical activity. More affluent people are typically more educated and have tools to counter unhealthy foods, such as access to healthy food, physical trainers, and parks and fitness centers.\n\nObesity and being overweight is one of the main risk factors of type 2 diabetes. Other risk factors include lack of physical activity, genetic predisposition, being over 45 years old, tobacco use, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. In United States, the prevalence of obesity was 39.8% in adults and 18.5% in children and adolescents in 2015-2016. In Australia in 2014-2015, 2 out 3 adults or 63% were overweight or obese. Also, 2 out of 3 adults did little or no exercise. According to the World Health Organization, Europe had the 2nd highest proportion of overweight or obese people in 2014 behind America.\n\nAccording to WHO the prevalence of diabetes is rising more in the middle and low income countries. Over the next 25 years, the number of people with diabetes in developing countries will increase by over 150%. Diabetes is typically seen in people above the retirement age in developed countries, but in developing countries people in the age of 35-64 are mostly affected. Although, diabetes is considered a disease of affluence affecting the developed countries, there is more loss of life and premature death among people with diabetes in the developing countries. Asia accounts for 60% of the world's diabetic population. In 1980 less than 1% of Chinese adults were affected by diabetes, but by 2008 the prevalence was 10%. It is predicted that by 2030 diabetes may affect 79.4 million people in India, 42.3 million people in China and 30.3 million in United States.\n\nThese changes are the result of developing nations having rapid economic development. This rapid economic development has caused a change in the lifestyle and food habits leading to over-nutrition, increased intake of fast food causing increase in weight, and insulin resistance. Compared to the west, obesity in Asia is low. India has very low prevalence of obesity, but a very high prevalence of diabetes suggesting that diabetes may occur at a lower BMI in Indians as compared to the Europeans. Smoking increases the risk for diabetes by 45%. In developing countries around 50-60 % adult males are regular smokers, increasing their risk for diabetes. In developing countries, diabetes is more commonly seen in the more urbanized areas. The prevalence of diabetes in rural population is 1/4th that of urban population for countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka.\n\nCardiovascular disease refers to a disease of the heart and blood vessels. Conditions and diseases associated with heart disease include: stoke, coronary heart disease, congenital heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and cardiomyopathy. Cardiovascular disease is known as the world's biggest killer. 17.5 million people die from it each year, which equals 31% of all deaths. Heart disease and stroke cause 80% of these deaths.\n\nHigh blood pressure is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has contributed to 12% of the cardiovascular related deaths worldwide. Other significant risk factors for heart disease include high cholesterol and smoking. 47% of all Americans have one of these three risk factors. Lifestyle choices, such as poor diet and physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use can also contribute to cardiovascular disease. Medical conditions, like diabetes and obesity can also be risk factors.\n\nIn the United States, 610,000 people die every year from heart disease which is equal to 1 in 4 deaths. The leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States is heart disease. In Canada, heart disease is the second leading cause of death. In 2014, it was the cause of death for 51,000 people. In Australia, heart disease is also the leading cause of death. 29% of deaths in 2015, had an underlying cause of heart disease. Heart disease causes one in four premature deaths in the United Kingdom and in 2015 heart disease caused 26% of all deaths in that country.\n\nPeople of lower socio-economic status are more likely to have cardiovascular disease than those who have a higher socio-economic status. This inequality gap has occurred in developed countries because people who have a lower socio-economic status often face many of the risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use, obesity as well as having a sedentary lifestyle. Further social and environmental factors such as poverty, pollution, family history, housing and employment contribute to this inequality gap and to risk of having a health condition caused by cardiovascular disease. The increasing inequality gap between the higher and lower income populations continues in countries such as Canada, despite the availability of health care for everyone.\n\nDementia is a chronic syndrome which is characterized by deterioration in the thought process beyond what is expected from normal aging. It affects the persons memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, behavior and ability to perform everyday activity. There are many different forms of dementia . Alzheimer is the most common form which contributes to 60-70 % of the dementia cases. Different forms of dementia can co-exist.Young onset dementia which occurs in individuals before the age of 65 contributes to 9% of the total cases. It is the major cause of disability and dependency among old people.\n\nWorldwide, there are 50 million people who are suffering from dementia and every year 10 million new cases are being reported. The total number of people with dementia is projected to reach 82 million by 2030 and 152 million in 2050 .\n\nAccording to CDC, Alzheimer is the 6th leading cause of death in U.S adults and 5th leading cause of death in adults over the age of 65. In 2014, 5 million Americans above the age of 65 were diagnosed with Alzheimer. This number is predicted to triple by the year 2060 and reach up to 14 million. Dementia and Alzheimer has been shown to go unreported on death certificates, leading to under representation of the actual mortality caused by these diseases. Between 2000 and 2015, mortality due to cardiovascular diseases has decreased by 11%, where as death from Alzheimer has increased by 123%. 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 die from Alzheimer or other forms of dementia. Furthermore, 200,000 individuals have been affected by young onset dementia. In United States, Alzheimer affects more women than men. It is twice more common in African-Americans and Hispanics than in whites. As the number of older Americans increases rapidly, the number of new cases of Alzheimer will rise too .\n\nEast Asia has the most people living with dementia (9.8 million) followed by Western Europe (7.5 million ), South Asia (5.1 million) and North America (4.8 million).  In 2016, the prevalence of Alzheimer was 5.05% in Europe. Like in United States, it is more prevalent in women than in men. In the European Union, Finland has the highest mortality among both men and women due to dementia. In Canada, over half a million people are living with dementia. It is projected that by 2031 the number will go up by 66% to 937,000. Every year 25,000 new cases of dementia are diagnosed .\n\nDementia is the second leading cause of death in Australia. In 2016, it was the leading cause of deaths in females. In Australia 436,366 people are living with dementia in 2018. 3 in 10 people over the age of 85 and 1 in 10 people over the age of 65 have dementia. It is the single greatest cause of disability in older Australians . Rates of dementia are higher for indigenous people. In people from the northern territory and western Australia the prevalence of dementia is 26 times higher in the 45-69 year old group and about 20 times greater in 60-69 year old group.\n\nThe risk factors for developing dementia or Alzheimer's include age, family history, genetic factors, environmental factors, brain injury, viral infections,neurotoxic chemicals, and various immunological and hormonal disorders.\n\nA new research study has found an association between the affluence of a country, hygiene conditions and the prevalence of Alzheimer in their population. According to the Hygiene Hypothesis, affluent countries with more urbanized and industrialized areas have better hygiene, better sanitation, clean water and improved access to antibiotics. This reduces the exposure to the friendly bacteria, virus and other microorganisms that help stimulate our immune system. Decreased microbial exposure leads to immune system that is poorly developed, which exposes the brain to inflammation as is seen in Alzheimer's disease.\n\nCountries like the UK and France that have access to clean drinking water, improved sanitation facilities and have a high GDP show a 9% increase in Alzheimer's disease as opposed to countries like Kenya and Cambodia. Also countries like UK and Australia, where three quarters of their population lives in urban areas, have a 10% higher Alzheimer's rate than in countries like Bangladesh and Nepal where less than one tenth of their population live in urban areas.\n\nAlzheimer's risk changes with the environment. Individuals from the same ethnic background living in an area of low sanitation will have a lower risk as compared to the same individuals living in an area of high sanitation who will be exposed to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's. An African-American in U.S. has a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's as compared to one living in Nigeria. Immigrant populations exhibit Alzheimer disease rates intermediate between their home country and adopted country. Moving from a country of high sanitation to a country of low sanitation reduces the risk associated with the disease.\n\nPeople that face poverty have more risks related to having a mental illness and also do not have as much access to treatment. The stressful events that they face, unsafe living condition and poor physical health lead to cycle of poverty and mental illness that is seen all over the world. According to the World Health Organization 76%-85% of people living in lower and middle income countries are not treated for their mental illness. For those in higher-income counties, 35%-50% of people with mental illness do not receive treatment. It is estimated that 90% of deaths by suicide are caused by substance use disorders and mental illness in higher income countries. In lower to middle income countries, this number is lower.\n\nOne in four people have experienced mental illness at one time in their lives and approximately 450 million people in the world currently have a mental illness. People that face poverty have more risks related to having a mental illness and also do not have as much access to treatment. The stressful events that they face, unsafe living condition and poor physical health lead to cycle of poverty and mental illness that is seen all over the world. India, China, and the United States are the countries with the highest levels of mental illnesses of anxiety, depression and schizophrenia according to WHO. The U.S. is reported to have the highest level of depression worldwide. In the U.S., approximately one in five adults has a mental illness or 44.7 million people. In 2016, it was estimated that 268 million people in the world had depression. The range of people that have depression by country is from 2% to 6% of the population with the United States, Greenland, and Australia having higher rates of depression. Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder impacted 275 million people around the world in 2016. The range of population impacted by anxiety disorders globally is from 2.5 %-6.5%. Countries, such as the Australia, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Iran, the United States and a number of countries in Western Europe appear to have a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders.\n\nCancer is a generic term for a large group of disease which is characterized by rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries. These cells can invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs causing metastases, which is a major cause of death. According to WHO, Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally. One in six deaths worldwide are caused due to cancer, accounting to a total of 9.6 million deaths in 2018.Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer is the leading form of cancer deaths across most high and middle-income countries.\n\nIn United States, 1,735,350 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in 2018. Most common forms of cancer are cancer of the breast, lung, bronchus, prostrate, colorectal cancer, melanoma of skin, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal cancer, thyroid cancer and liver cancer. Cancer mortality is higher among men than in women. African-Americans have the highest risk of mortality due to cancer. Cancer is also the leading cause of death in Australia. The most common cancers in Australia are prostrate, breast, colorectal, melanoma and lung cancer. These account for 60% of the cancer cases diagnosed in Australia.\n\nEurope contains only 1/8 of the world population, but has around one quarter of the global cancer cases, with 3.7 million new cases each year. Lung, breast, stomach, liver, colon are the most common cancers in Europe. The overall incidences among different cancers vary across countries.\n\nAbout one in two Canadians will develop cancer in their lifetime, and one in four will die of the disease. In 2017, 206,200 new cases of cancer were diagnosed. Lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer accounted for about half of all cancer diagnoses and deaths.\n\nHigh prevalence of cancer in high-income countries is attributed to lifestyle factors like obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, diet and alcohol intake. Around 40% of the cancers can be prevented by modifying these factors. \n\nThe rate of allergies around the world has risen in industrialized nations over the past 50 years. A number of public health measures, such as sterilized milk, use of antibiotics and improved food production have contributed to a decrease in infections in developed countries. There is a proposed causal relationship, known as the \"hygiene hypothesis\" that indicates that there are more autoimmune disorders and allergies in developed countries with fewer infections. In developing countries, it is assumed that the rates of allergies are lower than developed countries. That assumption may not be accurate due to limited data on prevalence. Research has found an increase in asthma by 10% in countries such as Peru, Costa Rica, and Brazil.\n\n\n"}

Filipinos form the fifth-largest migrant community in Italy, after the Romanian, Albanian, North African communities and Ukrainians. Italy is with the UK also the joint largest European migration destination for Filipinos. The Italian capital Rome is home to the largest Filipino community. Roughly 108,000 documented Filipinos reside in Italy as temporary workers or permanent residents, and estimates on the number of undocumented Filipinos vary widely from 20,000 to 80,000. In 2008, ISTAT (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica), Italy’s statistics office, reported that there were 113,686 documented Filipinos living in Italy whereas the number had been 105,675 in 2007.\n\n63% of Filipino Italians are women, and they mostly work as domestic assistants. The Filipino Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) says that Italy allows 5000 non-seasonal/regular workers, up from 3000 in 2007. The DOLE said that the change was \"a sign of appreciation of the good bilateral cooperation with the Philippines in migratory issues.\" There are approximately 60 Filipino organisations in Italy, most of which are church-based, although there are several cultural and civic groups as well. One of such groups is the Filipino Women's Council with the aim of educating Filipino women migrants about their rights and lobbying on their behalf.\n\nIn 2007, Italy gave Filipinos with a Filipino driver's license a free Italian driver's license.\n\nIn 2007, Filipinos in Italy sent the equivalent of US$500 million back to the Philippines, making it the fourth-largest source of remittances after the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Canada. The town of Mabini in Batangas has extensively benefited from Italian Filipinos; the town has the most former residents living abroad than any other Filipino town or city. Most of those living abroad work in Italy, and a section of Mabini today that has large homes built from remittance money is named \"Little Italy\". However, due to the economic slump in 2008, remittance money from Italy grew at a much slower pace than usual.\n\n\n\n"}

The Philippine community have set up a school for their children in downtown Athens.\n\nA large proportion are women (81% ), who generally find employment as domestic workers. The association between Filipinas and domestic work is so strong that a Greek dictionary published in 1998 even defined \"Filippineza\", a term which literally means Filipina, to be \"a domestic worker from the Philippines or a person who performs non-essential auxiliary tasks\". Migrants and the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs protested to the Greek government about the dictionary.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43957234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43957234", "title": "Fisheries co-management", "text": "Fisheries co-management\n\nFisheries co-management is flexible and cooperative management of the aquatic resources by the user groups and the government.\n\nThe responsibility of the resource is shared between the user groups and the government, both the community and the government are involved during the decision making, implementation and enforcement processes.\n\nDepending on the level of participation between the government and the community, five different types of co-management have been identified.\nInstructive management is top down management from the government. The government instructs the fishermen as to what laws and policies they are required to follow. Information is only shared with the community towards the end of the planning process.\nIn consultative management, the government consults with the community either through public hearings or advisory boards. The government is not required to implement any of the suggestions or comments into the policy. This consultation can also serve merely as a symbolic gesture rather than something that the government will necessarily implement.\nIn cooperative management, there is a degree of co-management of the resource by the government and the user group. The responsibility is shared by both parties. Certain areas such as access rules may be the responsibility of the user group.\nIn advisory management, users decide what decisions should be made and advise the government as such, the government than endorses the decision.\n\nIn informative management, the user group makes all of the decisions, and informs the government once they have decided.\n\nCo-management developed due to an attempt to improve the success of fisheries management as many of the aquatic resources risked being or were already depleted. The aim was to involve the community in the decision making process so that there may be an increased adherence to the regulations set by the government.\n\nThe top down approach of fisheries management has frequently failed as it often goes against the community and their internal structure. Furthermore, the reason for the new governmental regulations and laws such as a decrease in total allowable catch (TAC) or catch per unit effort (CPUE) were often poorly understood by the community due to lack of education. Without proper enforcement or co-management the community would often disregard the law and continue as they previously were, often despite the detrimental impact this may have on the ocean.\n\nCo-management is different from community management as the government plays an important part in the decision making process. In community management the laws are generally not enforced as governmental laws, rather a community guide and framework, this can make prosecution difficult. In co-management the user group and the government develop laws and regulations together and works towards implementing them as a unit. If community based management forms part of national legislation, or developmental plans than it is classified as co-management.\n\nThe community, specifically the users of the resource often possess knowledge that can aid the government in the decision making process, therefore co-management is the combination of scientific and traditional knowledge, this process ensures the best possible outcome.\n\nIn dynamic environments conditions can vary at a rapid rate. The Arctic environment is a good example of a fast changing environment. If a good co-management structure is already implemented, it allows for quick decisions and implementations based on the required modification.\n\nCo-management is known to be time consuming, as one must spend time collecting surveys and gaining trust within the community. Strong lines of communication between the government and the community is essential. Educating the community is often necessary so that more informed decisions can be made.\n\nMany of the more isolated communities have a different language and communication can be slow and lack vital information. Existing laws and policies may need to be altered, or new ones created so as to allow for the structure of co-management.\nConflicting views and economic versus conservation issues appear to be some of the main limitations to a successful co-management process. Lack of funding, data and resources are also main contributing factors to un-successful co-management. Co-management requires constant communication and effort, and therefore long term sustainability can be difficult.\n\nThird party involvement such as non-governmental organizations (NGO’s), or student groups, often forms an essential part of a successful co-management.\n\nCommunity management,\nTop down,\nBottom up.\n\nBerkes F.

In 1970, he received the Padma Shri award, India's fourth highest civilian award for his contribution to Indian cinema. According to \"The Hindu\" and \"The Indian Express\", Ghantasala was \"Such a divine talent and with his songs he could move the hearts of the people.\" \"Ghantasala's blending of classical improvisations to the art of light music combined with his virtuosity and sensitivity puts him a class apart, above all others in the field of playback singing\".\" \"Gifted with what Indian Film Historian V. A. K. Ranga Rao called \"the most majestic voice\", Ghantasala helped Telugu film music develop its own distinct character which remains unparalleled\". He is referred to as the \"Gaana Gandharva\" for his mesmerising voice and musical skills.\n\nGhantasala performed in the United States, England and Germany, and for the United Nations Organisation. The government of Andhra Pradesh marked the occasion of 25 years of his film career as \"Silver Jubilee Celebrations of Ghantasala\" in Hyderabad on 1 February 1970. More than 30,000 people attended the function held at the Lal Bahadur Stadium, Hyderabad. Ghantasala continues to be popular. Statutes of his likeness have been installed across Andhra Pradesh. Every year, the anniversaries of his birth and death are celebrated in India and overseas.\n\nGhantasala was born in 1922 into a Telugu speaking Brahmin family of Soorayya Ghantasala, a professional singer in Chowtapalli, a village in Gudivada taluk of Krishna District. During his childhood, Ghantasala used to dance to his father's Tarangams. His father died when Ghantasala was a child, and he was brought up by his maternal uncle. He took formal music training from Patrayani Sitarama Sastry, and joined Maharajah's Government College of Music and Dance in Vijayanagram.\n\nGhantasala participated in the Quit India Movement of 1942, for which he was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months at the Alipore (Allipura) Jail, Bellary. After leaving jail, he met Samudrala Raghavacharya, who advised him to try his luck in the film industry as a singer. Ghantasala married Savitri, who lived in a village called Pedapulivarru. In that village, Ghantasala met lyricist Samudrala Raghavacharya, who was impressed with his voice and inducted him into the Madras film industry. Before Ghantasala found fame, he was already an accomplished Carnatic music singer.\n\nGhantasala's first break as a singer came from All India Radio. Later on, Peketi Siva Ram from HMV studios recorded Ghantasala's private songs. Ghantasala debuted as a chorus singer and for a character role in \"Seeta Rama Jananam\" by Pratibha Films. After this, he worked with well-known music directors \"Gali Penchala\" and C. R. Subbaraman. Ghantasala's first film as a music director was \"Laxmamma\". He introduced the technique of changing the vocal pitch and diction to suit the actor singing the songs. Ghantasala was peerless at Padyam renderings and his way with the Telugu padyam was incomparable.\n\nProducer Krishnaveni gave Ghantasala his first job as full-time music director for her film \"Mana Desam\", which was N. T. Rama Rao's first film. It established Ghantasala as a music composer-cum-playback singer. He was the most prolific film composer and playback singer in Telugu cinema until the mid-1970s. He composed music for many popular Telugu movies, including \"Patala Bhairavi\", \"Mayabazaar\", \"Lava Kusa\", \"Pandava Vanavasam\", \"Rahasyam\",\"Gundamma Katha\", \"Paramanandayya Shishyula Katha\" and \"Pelli Chesi Chudu\", and also for popular Tamil and Kannada films in the 1950s and 1960s. Ghantasala sang for and directed the music for a Hindi film \"Jhandaa ooncha Rahe Hamara\" (1964). The song \"Siva Sankari\" from the film Jagadeka Veeruni Katha (1961) was sung by Ghantasala in a single take.\n\nGhantasala served as the \"Aaasthana Gaayaka\" (court musician) for the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. He recorded private albums, including Bhagawad Gita, Patriotic Songs, Padyalua unique genre of Telugu, singing the verses in dramatic stylePushpa Vilapam, Devotional and folk songs. His recording of \"Bhagawad Gita\", which he directed and sang, can now be heard daily in the Tirumala temple. According to music director Pendyala Nageswara Rao and playback singer P Susheela, \"Ghantasala alone is the foremost among playback singers who had a full-fledged melodious powerful voice range which could accommodate in uniformity, all the three octaves in music quite comfortably\".\n\nPendyala Nageswara Rao channelled Ghantasala's classical musical knowledge and skills in classical renditions and in Telugu films including siva sankari from film \"Jagadekaveeruni Katha\", Rasika Raja taguvaramu kama from film \"Jayabheri\", and Syamala Dandakam – Manikya Veena from film \"Mahakavi Kalidasu\". Pendyala said these renditions were recorded only in one take by Ghantasala.\n\nGhantasala died on 11 February 1974, two months after his 51st birthday, due to cardiac arrest at a hospital in Chennai. The last song he recorded was for a documentary – Bhadrachala Ramadasu Vaibhavam ( music by Master Venu ) from the hospital bed the day before his death.\n\nThe Indian government released a postage stamp and first day cover to celebrate Ghantasala's work on 11 February 2003. He is the first movie singer-composer of the south to be accorded this honour. The US Postal Department has released a postal stamp on Ghantasala on 6 October 2014. The postal stamp was jointly released by the North American Telugu Society (NATS) in collaboration with Telugu Literary and Cultural Association (TLCA) in New York.\nVarious awards named after Ghantasala are given every year, including the \"Ghantasala melody king award\". Recipients of this award include playback singers K J Yesudas and P Suseela, and Indian Idol Sri Ramachandra. Ghantasala Arts Academy has instituted the \"Ghantasala National Award\"; the first winner was playback singer S. P. Balasubrahmanyam.\n\nGhantasala was honoured with the \"Padmashri\" by the Government of India. He won the best playback singer award in Andhra Pradesh every year for nearly 30 years, a feat unachieved by any other playback singer.\n\nAfter the saint poet Annamacharya in the 15th century, Ghantasala has been the only singer to perform devotional songs inside the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple near the Lord Moola Virat.\n\"Kala Pradarshini Ghantasala Puraskar\", the only award instituted directly by the Ghantasala Family curated by his second son Ravi Ghantasala and his wife, acclaimed dancer Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala, which aims to honor legends who have contributed to \"Arts and Philanthropy\". the Inaugural awards were presented to Dr.S.P.Balasubramanyam (music), Dr. Padma Subramaniam (Dance) and Dr. Nalli Kuppusamy Chetty (Philanthropy). \n\nThe late singer remains an inspiration for many aspiring singers even to this day. A lot of books based on the life of Ghantasala have been published over the years. As a tribute, CH Rama Rao has written the script for the telefilm based on the life and time of the great singer, to be directed by award-winning documentary filmmaker Karri Balaji. The film will be based on the discography of the legendary singer titled, \"Ghantasala Patasala\", that comprises 555 songs sung by Ghantasala.\n\n\"It is an honour to be directing the film based on Ghantasala. We will begin shooting for the film on December 4, which happens to be the 92nd birth anniversary of the great singer. The film will cover all aspects of the great man's life,\" said Karri Balaji.\n\n\"The Ghantasala Puraskar Award\" 2014, given every year by Sharan Incorporation, has been conferred on Rao Bala Saraswathi Devi, who was the first Telugu playback singer.\nThe Government music college in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, is named after Ghantasala. Ghantasala Sangeetha Kalasala college in Hyderabad and Vizag offers six-month and one-year diploma courses on Ghantasala's light music, songs and music.\n\nGhantasala Venkateswararao was married to Savitri and ( Late ) Saraladevi. He was blessed with 8 children : 4 Daughters ( Shyamala, Suguna, Shanthi, Meera ) and 4 Sons ( Vijaya Kumar, Ratna Kumar, Ravi Kumar, Sankar Kumar ).\n\nIt is said that Ghantasala named his eldest son “Vijaya” Kumar after Vijaya Productions out of gratitude towards the organization being employed as a permanent artist. Sri Chakrapani, one of then producers of Vijaya Productions, presented Ghantasala a purse with Rs. 25,000 realizing such faith towards the organization.\n\nGhantasala recorded songs as playback singer for the movies under popular composers – S Rajeswara Rao, Pendyala Nageswara Rao, M S Viswanathan, K V Mahadevan, Adi Narayana Rao, Master Venu, T V Raju, T Chalapathi Rao, S P Kodandapani, Shankar Jai Kishan, Susarla Dakshina Murthy, Galipenchala Narasimha Rao etc.\n\n\n\n"}

LeSueur (died 1938) and Anna Bell Johnson (died 1958). His older sister was Daisy LeSueur (1901/1902 – 1904), and his younger sister was Lucille Fay LeSueur, later the Oscar-winning film star Joan Crawford. After Thomas LeSueur had abandoned the family, Anna wed businessman Henry J. Cassin (1868–1922), who nicknamed Lucille \"Billie\". She was known for a while as \"Billie Cassin\". The family lived in Lawton, Oklahoma, then moved to Kansas City, Missouri, around 1916. Hal LeSueur moved from Kansas City around 1928 to Los Angeles. He found work in the stock department at MGM in bit parts or as an extra.\n\nHe was married twice. His first wife was Jessie Burress (July 17, 1903 – December 2, 1977). They wed on October 21, 1922 in Kansas City, Missouri (age given as 21) and divorced some time later on an unknown date. His second wife was Kasha Haroldi (March 31, 1907 – June 26, 1992), whom he married in 1931. Hal and Kasha LeSueur had one child, a daughter, named Joan Crawford LeSueur , who was named for Hal's sister (December 2, 1933 – December 15, 1999), who became a dancer on Broadway, known professionally as Joan Lowe. Hal and Kasha married in Santa Ana, California on September 16, 1931, with Hal's age given as 30. Kasha and Hal LeSueur divorced in 1935. She won custody of their daughter. She remarried and became Mrs. Kasha Lowe; her daughter became Joan Lowe, the name by which she was known professionally, later Mrs. Joan Fowler.\n\nOn November 9, 1935, LeSueur was in a head-on collision at the top of Cahuenga Pass. The other car caught fire and the three people inside, Earl Gose, who was driving, his wife, Golda, and his unmarried sister, Grace, were pulled from the blaze. Their car burned to a charred hulk. LeSueur suffered severe cuts and bruises on his hands, face, arms and legs. The other people were also seriously injured. All were taken to a hospital in Hollywood. The injuries of Grace Gose proved fatal three days later. His mother, Anna, and his ex-wife, Kasha, accompanied him to the coroner's inquest on November 15. Earl and Golda Gose were unable to appear. LeSueur testified that he was driving near the center of the highway when the other car suddenly pulled out from behind another car into his lane and he was unable to avoid the collision. The Coroner's jury exonerated him of blame for the crash, returning a verdict of accidental death.\n\nIn February 1936, Earl and Golda Gose sued him, seeking $86,400 in damages. Golda, who was taken into court on a hospital stretcher, which was placed before the jury box, testified that LeSueur was driving on the wrong side of Cahuenga Boulevard when his car collided with theirs. LeSueur not only denied responsibility for the accident, but in his cross-complaint for $10,000 charged that the crash came about through Gose's negligent driving. The suit was then abruptly dropped, however, when a settlement was reached. LeSueur agreed to pay them $8,500, one tenth of what they had originally sought.\n\nTired of being an uncredited actor in the films on which he worked, he decided to try his hand at make-up work at MGM for a while. When he left that job, he worked as a sporting goods salesman. LeSueur made one final movie appearance, playing a reporter in \"Jeanne Eagels\" (1957), the only role for which LeSueur received screen credit. He made one TV appearance in an episode of the series \"State Trooper\", titled \"No Fancy Cowboys\", which aired on March 13, 1957. When he left the sporting goods business, LeSueur began working as a desk clerk at a Los Angeles hotel, and supplemented his income working as a switchboard operator at the motel where he lived.\n\nHal LeSueur died of a ruptured appendix at General Hospital. He was interred in Forest Lawn Cemetery, Glendale, California. He was originally believed to have been 59 years old, but may have been 61.

{"id": "36910318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36910318", "title": "Hampden Clubs", "text": "Hampden Clubs\n\nThe Hampden Clubs were political campaigning and debating societies formed in England in the early 19th century as part of the Radical Movement. They were particularly concentrated in the Midlands and the northern counties, and were closely associated with the popular movements for social and political reform that arose in the years following the end of the Napoleonic wars. They were forced underground, and eventually disbanded, in the face of legislation and pressure from the authorities.\n\nThe original Hampden Club was formed in London in 1812. John Cartwright is generally regarded as the originator and founder, although evidence has been offered that Cartwright's friend Thomas Northmore actually initiated the clubs. Edward Blount (MP) was another founder member. Cartwright certainly dominated the movement from 1813 onwards. A former naval and militia officer with a long record of political activism, he toured northwest England to promote the idea of a forum for political debate among ordinary people . There had been no similar institutions since the London Corresponding Society, which had disbanded in 1794. The clubs were intended to bring together middle class moderates and lower class Radicals in the reform cause, and were named for John Hampden, an English Civil War Parliamentary leader. \n\nIn 1813 Cartwright was arrested in Huddersfield while promoting the Clubs. He made a further promotional tour in 1815. \n\nThe first Hampden Club outside London was formed in 1816 by William Fitton at Royton. Other clubs in the north-west soon followed; in Middleton the radical weaver-poet Samuel Bamford started one. Other clubs were formed in Oldham, Manchester, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne and Stockport.\n\nClub members paid a penny per week subscription, and usually met weekly for political discussion and debate. Radical pamphlets were read, and newspaper articles by prominent reformers like William Cobbett. Samuel Bamford describes the activities of club members in positive terms, emphasising them as a peaceful alternative to riot and destruction of property. \n\nHampden clubs were now established in many of our large towns, and the villages and districts around them. Cobbett's books were printed in a cheap form; the labourers read them, and thenceforward became deliberate and systematic in their proceedings. Nor were there wanting men of their own class, to encourage and direct the new converts. The Sunday Schools of the preceding thirty years had produced many working men of sufficient talent to become readers, writers, and speakers in the village meetings for parliamentary reform. Some also were found to possess a rude poetic talent, which rendered their effusions popular, and bestowed an additional charm on their assemblages; and by such various means, anxious listeners at first, and then zealous proselytes, were drawn from the cottages of quiet nooks and dingles, to the weekly readings and discussions of the Hampden clubs.\n\nIn January 1817, regional Hampden Clubs and similar political debating societies sent 70 delegates to a convention at the Crown & Anchor tavern in Strand, London, well known as a meeting-place of radicals. The assembly was called by Cartwright and Jones Burdett, brother of Sir Francis Burdett. To avoid falling foul of the Seditious Societies Act, the convention met in public session and described itself as a gathering of deputies from petitioning communities, discussing how to achieve constitutional reform. The wording proposed by the Hampden Clubs' leadership included votes for all householders, electoral boundary reform and annual elections. However, the moderates were outvoted by those who favoured more radical reforms, and there were angry words from those who felt the Clubs' plans had been hijacked by others. The final resolutions of the meeting carried no reference to the Hampden Clubs. Reports of the meeting in \"The Times\" criticised both the meeting and its outcome, and accused the delegates of attempting to overthrow the Constitution.\n\nThe clubs were regarded with suspicion by the authorities, which saw them as breeding grounds for the growing radicalism of the times. On 9 February 1817 a secret Parliamentary Committee report concluded that the real object of the Hampden Clubs and similar institutions was to foment \"an insurrection, so formidable from numbers, as by dint of physical strength to overpower all resistance\". The government began to introduce legislation, such as the Seditious Meetings Act 1817, and it became more difficult for political clubs to meet. For example, the Birmingham Hampden Club, founded in September 1816 and boasting 300 regular attendees by the following January, had a moderate ethos and publicly condemned violence after a local riot, but struggled to find venues as publicans were pressured not to permit club meetings on their premises. Private rooms were found, but by April 1817, in an atmosphere of suspicion and with the government spy and \"agent provocateur\" Oliver active in the city, regular club meetings were suspended. In Manchester the movement's leaders were targeted by the city's deputy constable, Joseph Nadin, who arrested many of them, including Samuel Bamford, after the unrest of March 1817 and sent them to London in irons, where some spent months in prison before their release without charge. With the Hampden clubs stifled, the Lancashire leadership formed the Patriotic Union Society, and it was this body that called the 1819 public meeting for political reform that became the Peterloo Massacre.\n"}

They are also known as Sangtarash and Hansiri. A few were also found in Panipat and Karnal in Haryana, most of whom are now found in Pakistan. They generally refer themselves as Khumra Shaikh. The community has been granted Other Backward Classes status in Uttar Pradesh.\nThe community was traditionally associated with the manufacture of millstones (chaki in Urdu), which they then peddled throughout North India and Punjab. According to their traditions, they descend from the Muslim soldiers, who are said to have settled in India sometime at the start of Muslim rule in North India. Like other Indian Muslim artisan communities, they have suffered from a decline in their traditional occupation as a result of growing mechanization, and many are now involved in daily wage labour.\nThe Khumra speak Urdu, and the Khari boli dialect of Hindi. They are exclusively Sunni, and claim to be of Shaikh status. They are found mainly in Rohilkhand, in particular the districts of Bareilly, Bijnor, Moradabad and Rampur. The Khumra are largely an urban community, occupying their own distinct quarters. A small number of Khumra are found in the Awadh region of Uttar Pradesh, mainly in the districts of Hardoi, Unnao and Sitapur.\n\nThe community is endogamous, and consists of several biradaris, all whom inter-marry and are of equal status. Of the several biradaris, the main ones are the Bahmani, Ghori, Hataiwale, Quraishi, Multani, Nawabar, Pacchawi, Pathan, Siddiqi and Tayar. In theory, all the biradari members descend from a common ancestor. The biradari name is also used as there surnames. Their customs are similar to other Muslims artisan castes, and this includes the presence of a caste council, known as a biradari panchayat, which deals with intra community disputes and acts as an institution of social control. Historically, the panchayat was extremely powerful, but this is no longer the case.\nThe Khumra in India have now set up an India wide caste association, the All India Khumra Hansiri/ Sangtarash Biradari, which acts as pressure group and community welfare organization. Many Khumra are involved in the manufacture of fans and mats from date leaves, grinding of stones and flour milling. Others are employed as industrial labourers or agricultural workers. Only a very small number own land, and are cultivators. The community has been granted Other Backward Class status, which allows it to obtain the benefit of a number of Government of India affirmative action programmes. \nThe Khumra of Haryana were mainly weavers, with peddling being a subsidiary occupation. They had much in common with the Bhatra Sikhs, whom they competed with, especially in the canal colonies of the Punjab. Like other Muslim communities of Haryana, they were expelled at the time of partition, and ended up settling in Pakistani Punjab. They now been assimilated by the Ansaris, a much larger weaving caste.\n\n"}

{"id": "36408400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36408400", "title": "Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning", "text": "Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning\n\nMetropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning (also known as 'CT' planning - see below) is an approach to managing the growth of metropolises. It is a type of regional planning, as it deals with issues beyond strict city limits. It was first applied to the Madrid Metropolitan Plan in 1996 and has since been applied to a number of other metropolises.\n\nThe methodology has two principal components: linearity and scale.\n\nMetropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning detected that, counter to Walter Christaller’s Central Place Theory, metropolises and urban systems do not exist in ‘featureless plains’. This notion is the precondition to the application of Christaller's theory. To the contrary, Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning analyzes that most metropolises develop in a particular geographical site, a strategic location for economic and social relations. A strategic location is one that has a comparative advantage mostly related to a point of transition between two geographical systems: the comparative advantage at the border between two ecosystems.\n\nStrategic locations are places like seaports, river crossings, mountain passages or foothills. Often each ecosystem requires a different mode of transportation. The geographical comparative advantage that requires a logistic intermodal node has been the economic and social base on which metropolises grow.\n\nGeographical features are most commonly linear: a coast, river, ridge, etc. Metropolises are thus naturally determined by a linear direction inconsistent with the circular or hexagonal approach taken by Christaller’s theories and most common historical urban planning.\n\nThe proper response to linearity is the development of a gradient approach: parallel lines to the main linear feature produce a transversal force gradient. The reticula vertebrates the system in a natural way and responds to the location needs better than the hexagonal or orbital systems.\n\nAs an aggregation of urban units, the metropolis has a different scale. The integration of the urban and metropolitan scales is the focus of most metropolitan planning conflicts. A scale dialogue has to be articulated. It builds beyond the urban (1:5,000) and metropolitan (1:50,000) scales upwards to the national (1:500,000) and continental (1:5,000,000), as well as downwards to the urban design (1:500) and architecture (1:50) scales.\n\nMetropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning has been described as the ‘Chess on a Tripod’ (CT) Method. The Method consists of two principles:\n\nChess: (Also called Chessboard Planning) The Grey infrastructure (transportation) reticula form the basic chessboard pattern. Every municipality located in the core of this cellular structure plays a different role in the metropolitan system. The role played, decided in dialogue between the municipality and the regional-metropolitan authority, can be visualized as the role of the pieces in the Chess Game.\n\n\nAs in Chess, the location of these figures (which represent metropolitan functions) determines the results of the 'game,' i.e. control of the territory and the capacity to build up an economically efficient, socially equitable and environmentally sustainable metropolis.\n\nTripod: The development of a metropolis is based on a three-legged system: economy, sociology and environment. The three legs are under the control of the governance system, which is what unites the policy making of the three realms. The stool represents the government and the three legs constitute the tripod.\n\nThe objective of economic policies is to achieve efficiency. The objective of social policies is to achieve equity. The objective of environmental policies is to achieve sustainability (often involving implementing Green infrastructure. The objective of institutional governance is to achieve equilibrium (‘Ethical Equilibrium’) among the three areas.\n\nIt is upon this tripod mechanism that metropolitan planning must evolve its spatial integrative policies to maintain the efficiency, equity, sustainability and equilibrium in the 5 subsystems (Environment, Transport, Housing, Productive Activities and Social Facilities) that constitute the metropolitan system.\n\nThe mechanisms of the CT planning method require dialogue beyond that among the 3 legs of the stool, the Fabric and Form, and the 5 sub-systems. There are other realms of metropolitan decision making dialogues included in the method:\n\n\n\nThe Reticula, like a music pentagram, are the structural framework to hold the notes. The cells of the Matrix are the substantive units. They constitute the uniqueness of metropolitan space: the architecture of the metropolis.\n\nThe elements of the CT Method (mentioned above) make it a markedly different system than the common methodologies of urban planning.\n\n\nThe CT Method argues that while urban planning relates the administration (local authority) and the administrated (citizens), Metropolitan Planning relates the various administrations among themselves. The indicative (versus compulsory) procedure, consensus building emphasis and the mechanisms (variability, adaptability, time and sectors) are different, as is reflected both in process and outcome. Addressing metropolitan mechanisms with common urban planning methods is at the origin of the failures of metropolitan planning.\n\nThe CT Method has been applied within the World Bank for strategic analysis of rapidly growing metropolises, allowing for both long term development vision as well as short term decision making for structural projects, as is the case of NaMSIP (Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Project).\n\nOther World Bank 'D4D Propositive Analyses' include:\n\n\nInfluences of the system also may be seen in the Panama Metropolitan Plan (Panama 1997) and the Strategic Plan of Colombo (Sri Lanka 1996).\n\nThe method has been used in some academic institutions and universities to develop urban projects in Bari, Dar es Salaam, Cairo and Tehran within a consistent metropolitan context.\nThe Madrid Metropolitan Plan was the first application, under the direction of Pedro B. Ortiz, of the CT method, approved administratively in 1996 and backed by the Madrid Regional Parliament in May 1997.\n\nThe Plan was the physical continuation of a previously developed exercise of Strategic Urban Planning in 1989-1994 and established a framework for the future development of the Metropolis of Madrid. The numerous territorial decisions taken during the enforcement period until the new Planning Law of 2001 required revision and approval, have been determinant to the actual shape and efficiency of the metropolitan structure of Madrid.\n\nUnder the plan, to respond to the rapid growth Madrid was experiencing (50% every 20 years), the Metropolitan Reticular Matrix Planning methodology was set in place. The CT Method principles are the foundation of the design, implementation and management of this Metropolitan Plan.\n"}

Originated from ovtsa (oвца, sheep in Russian), ovtchar (sheep herder, or farm employee maintaining sheep). \n\nThough the term itself does not specify whether the dog is a herding dog or a livestock guardian dog, it refers in this case to livestock guardian and protection breeds of Russian origin for the simple reason that there are no herding breeds originating from Russia. At the same time, it is used as a part of breed name in Russian for shepherds or sheepdogs imported into the country. \n\nWhen Russian cynologists named dog breeds, they often used a combination of country of origin and the term Ovtcharka, meaning that this shepherd dog came from a specific region. For example, a shepherd of German origin is known in Russian as \"Nemetskaja Ovtcharka\", which translates as German Shepherd. \n\nOver the years, the term Ovtcharka has become common outside Russia and other countries where Russian is commonly spoken because of three livestock guardian breeds of Russian origin: Caucasian Ovtcharka, Central Asian Ovtcharka and South Russian Ovtcharka. The reason for the continuing use of this term instead of “shepherd” or “sheepdog” is the necessity to differentiate between a livestock guardian dog (especially of Russian origin) and a herding dog (commonly called Shepherd in English). All three breeds have different mentalities and much greater protection instincts than a German Shepherd or other popular herding dogs and use of a different breed name avoiding a common and potentially misleading term helps to distinguish such traits. \n\n"}

These options involved a public listing of either:\n\n\nHistorically, in the United States, there had been a group of publicly traded private equity firms that were registered as business development companies (BDCs) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\n\nTypically, BDCs are structured similar to real estate investment trusts (REITs) in that the BDC structure reduces or eliminates corporate income tax. In return, REITs are required to distribute 95% of their income, which may be taxable to its investors.\n\nAs of the end of 2008, among the largest BDCs (by market value, excluding Apollo Investment Corp, discussed elsewhere) are: American Capital Strategies , Ares Capital Corp. , BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp, Gladstone Investment Corp and Kohlberg Capital Corp .\n\nA Venture Capital Trust or VCT is a highly tax efficient UK closed-end collective investment scheme designed to provide capital finance for small expanding companies and capital gains for investors. VCTs are companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, which invest in other companies which are not themselves listed.\n\nFirst introduced by the Conservative government in the Finance Act, 1995 they have proved to be much less risky than originally anticipated. The last created VCTs to encourage investment into new UK businesses.\n\nAlthough there had previously been certain instances of publicly traded private equity vehicles, the convergence of private equity and the public equity markets attracted significantly greater attention when several of the largest private equity firms pursued various options through the public markets. Taking private equity firms and private equity funds public appeared an unusual move since private equity funds often buy public companies listed on exchange and then take them private. Private equity firms are rarely subject to the quarterly reporting requirements of the public markets and tout this independence to prospective sellers as a key advantage of going private.\n\nOn March 22, 2007, the Blackstone Group filed with the SEC to raise $4 billion in an initial public offering. On June 21, Blackstone swapped a 12.3% stake in its ownership for $4.13 billion in the largest U.S. IPO since 2002. Traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BX, Blackstone priced at $31 per share on June 22, 2007.\n\nIn May 2006, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts raised $5 billion in an initial public offering for a new permanent investment vehicle (KKR Private Equity Investors or KPE) listing it on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam (ENXTAM: KPE). KKR raised more than three times what it had expected at the outset as many of the investors in KPE were hedge funds seeking exposure to private equity but could not make long term commitments to private equity funds. Because private equity had been booming in the preceding years, the proposition of investing in a KKR fund appeared attractive to certain investors.\nHowever, KPE's first-day performance was lackluster, trading down 1.7% and trading volume was limited. Initially, a handful of other private equity firms and hedge funds had planned to follow KKR's lead but shelved those plans when KPE's performance continued to falter after its IPO. KPE's stock declined from an IPO price of €25 per share to €18.16 (a 27% decline) at the end of 2007 and a low of €11.45 (a 54.2% decline) per share in Q1 2008. KPE disclosed in May 2008 that it had completed approximately $300 million of secondary sales of selected limited\npartnership interests in and undrawn commitments to certain KKR-managed funds in order to generate liquidity and repay borrowings.\n\nLess than two weeks after the Blackstone Group IPO, in 2007 Kohlberg Kravis Roberts filed with the SEC in July 2007 to raise $1.25 billion by selling an ownership interest in its management company. KKR had previously listed its KKR Private Equity Investors (KPE) private equity fund vehicle in 2006. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market would dampen the prospects of obtaining a valuation that would be attractive to KKR and the flotation was repeatedly postponed.\n\nThe initial public offering completed by Blackstone intensified the level of attention directed toward the private equity industry overall as media commentators focused on the large payout received by the firm's CEO Steve Schwarzman. Schwarzman received a severe backlash from both critics of the private equity industry and fellow investors in private equity. An ill-timed birthday event around the time of the IPO led various commentators to draw comparisons to the excesses of notorious executives including Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom) and Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco International). David Bonderman, a co-founder of the private equity firm TPG Capital, remarked, \"We have all wanted to be private\n– at least until now. When Steve Schwarzman's biography with all the dollar signs is posted on the web site none of us will like the furor that results – and that's even if you like Rod Stewart.\"\n\nMeanwhile, other private equity investors would also seek to realize a portion of the value locked into their firms. In September 2007, the Carlyle Group sold a 7.5% interest in its management company to Mubadala Development Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for $1.35 billion, which valued Carlyle at approximately $20 billion. Similarly, in January 2008, Silver Lake Partners sold a 9.9% stake in its management company to CalPERS for $275 million.\n\nAdditionally, Apollo Management completed a private placement of shares in its management company in July 2007. By pursuing a private placement rather than a public offering, Apollo would be able to avoid much of the public scrutiny applied to Blackstone and KKR.\ncompanies. The Company also invests in the securities of public companies.\n\n"}

Bearer English), Babu English, and Bazaar English and several code-mixed varieties of English.\n\nThe formation of these regional/socio-economic dialects is the same form of language contact that has given rise to Scottish English.\n\nBabu English (a.k.a. Baboo English), the name originally coming from the Bengali word for a gentleman, is a dialect of English that first developed as an occupational dialect, amongst clerks in the Bengali-speaking areas of pre-Partition India. Originally characterised as a markedly ornate form of administrative English, it is now no longer confined solely to clerks, and can be found in Nepal, north India, and in some social circles in south India.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristics of Babu English are the florid, excessively polite, and indirect manner of expression, which have been reported for amusement value, in works such as Cecil Hunt's \"Honoured Sir\" collections (see Further reading), and lampooned, in works such as F. Anstey's \"Baboo Jabberjee, B.A.\", for over a century.\n\nButler English, also known as Bearer English or Kitchen English, is a dialect of English that first developed as an occupational dialect in the years of the Madras Presidency, but that has developed over time and is now associated mainly with social class rather than occupation. It is still spoken in major metropolitan cities. \n\nThe dialect of Butler English is singular. Therefore, the present participle is used for the future indicative, and the preterite. For example, for the preterite indicative \"done\", \"I telling\" translates to \"I will tell\", \"I done tell\" to \"I have told\", and \"done come\" to \"actually arrived\". This form of Indian English was used both by masters for speaking to their servants as well as by servants to speak to their masters.\n\nHinglish (the name is a combination of the words \"Hindi\" and \"English\") is a macaronic language, a hybrid of British English and South Asian languages – it is a code-switching variety of these languages whereby they are freely interchanged within a sentence or between sentences. While the name is based on the Hindi language, it does not refer exclusively to Hindi, but \"is used in India, with English words blending with Punjabi, and Hindi, and also within British Asian families to enliven standard English.\" It is predominantly spoken in North India and some parts of Mumbai and Bangalore with large North Indian populations.\n\nModern phonologists often divide Indian English into five major varieties.\n\nAssamese English refers to the English spoken by Assamese speakers.\nSome major difference between Assamese English and British English are mostly seen in some consonants. In Assamese English all vowels are usually short. \nBengali English (or eastern Indian English) here refers collectively to the varieties of the West Bengal state and neighbouring country of Bangladesh, which has been greatly influenced by Bengali. Its main subdivisions are Calcutta English as well as Dhaka English.\n\n\nWest Indian English here refers to a traditional variety spoken in the western part of India. \n\nCultivated Indian English here refers collectively to non-localised, non-working class, and more recent varieties of India and the surrounding region of India. It includes mainstream Indian English, a widely common, upper-class variety that preserves a few local Indian features while setting the basis for an otherwise General Indian English accent as well as new Cultivated Indian English, a youthful variety beginning in the 2000s.Though both are found rare in India.\n\nSouthern Indian English here refers to rural, broad varieties of India's south Regions. \n\nGeneral Indian English here refers to a variety originating outside of the island's eastern regions and southern regions, crossing regional boundaries throughout the Republic of India. As mentioned earlier, Cultivated Indian English is almost entirely this General Indian dialect but with a few features more Received Pronunciation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "186073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186073", "title": "Robert Hanssen", "text": "Robert Hanssen\n\nRobert Philip Hanssen (born April 18, 1944) is a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who spied for Soviet and Russian intelligence services against the United States from 1979 to 2001. His espionage was described by the Department of Justice as \"possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history.\" He is currently serving 15 consecutive life sentences at ADX Florence, a federal supermax prison near Florence, Colorado.\n\nHanssen was born in Chicago. His father, a police officer, was emotionally abusive to him during his childhood. In 1968 Hanssen married his wife Bonnie, a strict Roman Catholic. He converted to Catholicism and became heavily involved in the conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei. He hovered between varying academic pursuits and jobs before joining the FBI in 1976. Three years after joining, Hanssen approached the Soviet GRU to offer his services, launching his first espionage cycle which lasted until 1981. Hanssen restarted his espionage activities in 1985 and continued until 1991 when he broke off communications during the collapse of the Soviet Union, fearing he would be exposed. He restored communications the next year and continued until his arrest. Throughout his spying, Hanssen remained anonymous to the Russians.\n\nHanssen sold thousands of classified documents to the KGB which detailed U.S. strategies in the event of nuclear war, developments in military weapons technologies, and aspects of the U.S. counterintelligence program. He was spying at the same time as Aldrich Ames in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Both Ames and Hanssen compromised the names of KGB agents working secretly for the United States, some of whom were executed for their betrayal. Hanssen also revealed a multimillion dollar eavesdropping tunnel built by the FBI under the Soviet Embassy in Washington. After Ames' arrest in 1994, some of these intelligence breaches still remained unsolved. The FBI paid $7 million to a KGB agent to obtain a file on an anonymous mole, whom the FBI later identified as Hanssen through fingerprint and voice analysis.\n\nHanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at Foxstone Park near his home in Vienna, Virginia after leaving a package of classified materials at a dead drop site. He was charged with selling U.S. intelligence documents to the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia for more than US$1.4 million in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period. To avoid the death penalty, he pleaded guilty to 14 counts of espionage and one of conspiracy to commit espionage. He was sentenced to 15 life terms without the possibility of parole.\n\nHanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a family who lived in the Norwood Park community. His father Howard, a Chicago police officer, was emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood. He graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and went on to attend Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1966.\n\nHanssen applied for a cryptographer position in the National Security Agency, but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. He enrolled in dental school at Northwestern University but switched his focus to business after three years. Hanssen received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971 and took a job with an accounting firm. He quit after one year and joined the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. In January 1976, he left the police department to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nHanssen met Bernadette \"Bonnie\" Wauck, a staunch Roman Catholic, while attending dental school at Northwestern. The couple married in 1968, and Hanssen converted from Lutheranism to his wife's Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in the conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei.\n\nUpon becoming a special agent on January 12, 1976, Hanssen was transferred to the FBI's Gary, Indiana, field office. In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to New York City when the FBI transferred him to its field office there. The next year, Hanssen was moved into counter-intelligence and given the task of compiling a database of Soviet intelligence for the Bureau.\n\nIn 1979, only three years after joining the FBI, Hanssen approached the Soviet GRU and offered his services. He never indicated any political or ideological motive for his actions, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was profit. During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen told the GRU a significant amount, including information on the FBI's bugging activities and lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak was the betrayal of Dmitri Polyakov, a CIA informant who passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while he rose to the rank of General in the Soviet Army. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act against Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA mole Aldrich Ames in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, while Hanssen's attempt was not revealed until after his 2001 capture.\n\nIn 1981, Hanssen was transferred to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. and moved to the suburb of Vienna, Virginia. His new job in the FBI's budget office gave him access to information involving many different FBI operations. This included all the FBI activities related to wiretapping and electronic surveillance, which were Hanssen's responsibility. He became known in the Bureau as an expert on computers.\n\nThree years later, Hanssen transferred to the FBI's Soviet analytical unit, which was responsible for studying, identifying, and capturing Soviet spies and intelligence operatives in the United States. Hanssen's section was in charge of evaluating Soviet agents who volunteered to give intelligence to determine whether they were genuine or re-doubled agents. In 1985, Hanssen was again transferred to the FBI's field office in New York, where he continued to work in counter-intelligence against the Soviets. It was after the transfer, while on a business trip back to Washington, that he resumed his career in espionage.\n\nOn October 1, 1985, Hanssen sent an anonymous letter to the KGB offering his services and asking for US$100,000 in cash. In the letter, he gave the names of three KGB agents secretly working for the FBI: Boris Yuzhin, Valery Martynov, and Sergei Motorin. Although Hanssen was unaware of it, all three agents had already been exposed earlier that year by Ames. Martynov, Motorin, and Yuzhin were recalled to Moscow, where they were arrested, charged, tried, and convicted of espionage against the USSR. Martynov and Motorin were condemned to death and executed via a gun-shot to the back of the head. Yuzhin was imprisoned for six years before he was released under a general amnesty to political prisoners, and subsequently emigrated to the U.S. Because the FBI blamed Ames for the leak, Hanssen was not suspected nor investigated. The October 1 letter was the beginning of a long, active espionage period for Hanssen.\n\nHanssen was recalled yet again to Washington in 1987. He was given the task of making a study of all known and rumored penetrations of the FBI in order to find the man who had betrayed Martynov and Motorin; this meant that he was looking for himself. Hanssen ensured that he did not unmask himself with his study, but in addition, he turned over the entire study—including the list of all Soviets who had contacted the FBI about FBI moles—to the KGB in 1988. That same year, Hanssen, according to a government report, \"committed a serious security breach\" by revealing secret information to a Soviet defector during a debriefing. The agents working underneath him reported this breach to a supervisor, but no action was taken.\n\nIn 1989, Hanssen compromised the FBI investigation of Felix Bloch, a State Department official who had come under suspicion for espionage. Hanssen warned that Bloch was under investigation, causing the KGB to abruptly break off contact with Bloch. The FBI was unable to produce any hard evidence, and as a result, Bloch was never charged with a crime, although the State Department later terminated his employment and denied his pension. The failure of the Bloch investigation, and the FBI's investigation of how the KGB found out they were investigating Bloch, drove the mole hunt that eventually led to the arrest of Hanssen.\n\nLater that year, Hanssen handed over extensive information about American planning for Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), an umbrella term for intelligence collected by a wide array of electronic means, such as radar, spy satellites, and signal intercepts. When the Soviets began construction on a new embassy in 1977, the FBI dug a tunnel beneath their decoding room. The FBI planned to use it for eavesdropping, but never did for fear of being caught. Hanssen disclosed this detailed information to the Soviets in September 1989 and received a US$55,000 payment the next month. On two occasions, Hanssen gave the Soviets a complete list of American double agents.\n\nIn 1990, Hanssen's brother-in-law, Mark Wauck, who was also an FBI employee, recommended to the Bureau that Hanssen be investigated for espionage; this came after Bonnie Hanssen's sister Jeanne Beglis had found a pile of cash sitting on a dresser in the Hanssens' house. Bonnie had previously told her brother that Hanssen once talked about retiring in Poland, then part of the Eastern Bloc. Wauck also knew that the FBI was hunting for a mole and so spoke with his supervisor, who took no action.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in December 1991, Hanssen, possibly worried that he could be exposed during the ensuing political upheaval, broke off communications with his handlers for a time. The following year, after the Russian Federation took over the defunct USSR's spy agencies, Hanssen made a risky approach to the GRU, with whom he had not been in contact in ten years. He went in person to the Russian embassy and physically approached a GRU officer in the parking garage. Hanssen, carrying a package of documents, identified himself by his Soviet code name, \"Ramon Garcia,\" and described himself as a \"disaffected FBI agent\" who was offering his services as a spy. The Russian officer, who evidently did not recognize the code name, drove off. The Russians then filed an official protest with the State Department, believing Hanssen to be a triple agent. Despite having shown his face, disclosed his code name, and revealed his FBI affiliation, Hanssen escaped arrest when the Bureau's investigation into the incident did not advance.\n\nHanssen continued to take risks in 1993, when he hacked into the computer of a fellow FBI agent, Ray Mislock, printed out a classified document from Mislock's computer, and took the document to Mislock, saying, \"You didn't believe me that the system was insecure.\" His superiors were not amused and launched an investigation. In the end, officials believed Hanssen's claim that he was merely demonstrating flaws in the FBI's security system. Mislock has since theorized that Hanssen probably went onto his computer to see if his superiors were investigating him for espionage, and invented the document story to cover his tracks.\n\nIn 1994, Hanssen expressed interest in a transfer to the new National Counterintelligence Center, which coordinated counter-intelligence activities. When told that he would have to take a lie detector test to join, Hanssen changed his mind. Three years later, convicted FBI mole Earl Edwin Pitts told the Bureau that he suspected Hanssen was dirty due to the Mislock incident. Pitts was the second FBI agent to mention Hanssen by name as a possible mole, but superiors were still unconvinced. No action was taken.\n\nIT personnel from the National Security Division's IIS Unit were sent to investigate Hanssen's desktop computer following a reported failure. NSD chief Johnnie Sullivan ordered the computer impounded after it appeared to have been tampered with. A digital investigation found that an attempted hacking had taken place using a password cracking program installed by Hanssen, which caused a security alert and lockup. Following confirmation by the FBI CART Unit, Sullivan filed a report with the Office of Professional Responsibility requesting further investigation of Hanssen's attempted hack. Hanssen claimed that he was attempting to connect a color printer to his computer, but needed the password cracker to bypass the administrative password. The FBI believed his story and Hanssen was let off with a warning.\n\nDuring the same time period, Hanssen would search the FBI's internal computer case record to see if he was under investigation. He was indiscreet enough to type his own name into FBI search engines. Finding nothing, Hanssen decided to resume his spy career after eight years without contact with the Russians. He established contact with the SVR (the successor to the Soviet-era KGB) in the fall of 1999. He continued to perform highly incriminating searches of FBI files for his own name and address.\n\nThe existence of two Russian moles working in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment simultaneously—Ames at the CIA and Hanssen at the FBI—complicated counterintelligence efforts in the 1990s. Ames was arrested in 1994; his exposure explained many of the asset losses American intelligence suffered in the 1980s, including the arrest and execution of Martynov and Motorin. However, two cases—the Bloch investigation and the embassy tunnel—stood out and remained unsolved. Ames had been stationed in Rome at the time of the Bloch investigation, and could not have had knowledge of that case or of the tunnel under the embassy, as he did not work for the FBI.\n\nThe FBI and CIA formed a joint mole-hunting team in 1994 to find the suspected second intelligence leak. They formed a list of all agents known to have access to cases that were compromised. The FBI's codename for the suspected spy was \"Graysuit.\" Some promising suspects were cleared, and the mole hunt found other penetrations such as CIA officer Harold James Nicholson. But Hanssen escaped notice.\n\nBy 1998, using FBI criminal profiling techniques, the pursuers zeroed in on an innocent man: Brian Kelley, a CIA operative involved in the Bloch investigation. The CIA and FBI searched his house, tapped his phone and put him under surveillance, following him and his family everywhere. In November 1998, they had a man with a foreign accent come to Kelley's door, warn him that the FBI knew he was a spy and tell him to show up at a Metro station the next day in order to escape. Kelley instead reported the incident to the FBI. In 1999, the FBI even interrogated Kelley, his ex-wife, two sisters and three children. All denied everything. He was eventually placed on administrative leave, where he remained falsely accused until after Hanssen was arrested.\n\nFBI investigators later made progress during an operation in which they paid off disaffected Russian intelligence officers to deliver information on moles. They paid $7 million to KGB agent Alexandr Shcherbakov who had access to a file on \"B.\" While it did not contain Hanssen's name, among the information was an audiotape of a July 21, 1986, conversation between \"B\" and KGB agent Aleksander Fefelov. FBI agent Michael Waguespack felt the voice was familiar, but could not remember who it was. Rifling through the rest of the files, they found notes of the mole using a quote from General George S. Patton about \"the purple-pissing Japanese.\" FBI analyst Bob King remembered Hanssen using that same quote. Waguespack listened to the tape again and recognized the voice as belonging to Hanssen. With the mole finally identified, locations, dates and cases were matched with Hanssen's activities during the time period. Two fingerprints collected from a trash bag in the file were analyzed and proved to be Hanssen's.\n\nThe FBI placed Hanssen under surveillance and soon discovered that he was again in contact with the Russians. In order to bring him back to FBI headquarters, where he could be closely monitored and kept away from sensitive data, they promoted him in December 2000 and gave him a new job supervising FBI computer security. In January 2001, Hanssen was given an office and an assistant, Eric O'Neill, who in reality was a young FBI agent who had been assigned to watch Hanssen. O'Neill ascertained that Hanssen was using a Palm III PDA to store his information. When O'Neill was able to briefly obtain Hanssen's PDA and have agents download and decode its encrypted contents, the FBI had its \"smoking gun.\"\n\nDuring his final days with the FBI, Hanssen began to suspect that something was wrong; in early February 2001 he asked his friend at a computer technology company for a job. He also believed he was hearing noises on his car radio which indicated that it was bugged, although the FBI was later unable to reproduce the noises Hanssen claimed to have heard. In the last letter he wrote to the Russians, which was picked up by the FBI when he was arrested, Hanssen said that he had been promoted to a \"do-nothing job ... outside of regular access to information,\" and that, \"Something has aroused the sleeping tiger.\"\nHowever, his suspicions did not stop him from making one more dead drop. After dropping his friend off at the airport on February 18, 2001, Hanssen drove to Virginia's Foxstone Park. He placed a white piece of tape on a park sign, which was a signal to his Russian contacts that there was information at the dead drop site. He then followed his usual routine, taking a package consisting of a sealed garbage bag of classified material and taping it to the bottom side of a wooden footbridge over a creek. When FBI agents spotted this highly incriminating act they rushed in to catch Hanssen red-handed and arrest him. Upon being arrested, Hanssen asked, \"What took you so long?\" The FBI waited two more days to see if any of Hanssen's SVR handlers would show up at Foxstone Park. When they failed to appear, the Justice Department announced the arrest on February 20.\n\nWith the representation of Washington lawyer Plato Cacheris, Hanssen negotiated a plea bargain that enabled him to escape the death penalty in exchange for cooperating with authorities. On July 6, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 14 counts of espionage and one of conspiracy to commit espionage in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On May 10, 2002, he was sentenced to fifteen consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. \"I apologize for my behavior. I am shamed by it,\" Hanssen told U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton. \"I have opened the door for calumny against my totally innocent wife and children. I have hurt so many deeply.\"\n\nHanssen is Federal Bureau of Prisons prisoner #48551-083. He is serving his sentence at the ADX Florence, a federal supermax prison near Florence, Colorado, in solitary confinement for twenty-three hours a day.\n\nHanssen never told the KGB or GRU his identity and refused to meet them personally, with the exception of the abortive 1993 contact in the Russian embassy parking garage. The FBI believes the Russians never knew the name of their source. Going by the alias \"Ramon\" or \"Ramon Garcia,\" Hanssen exchanged intelligence and payments through an old-fashioned dead drop system in which he and his KGB handlers would leave packages in public, unobtrusive places. He refused to use the dead drop sites that his handler, Victor Cherkashin, suggested and instead picked his own. He also designated a code to be used when dates were exchanged. Six was to be added to the month, day, and time of a designated drop time, so that, for example, a drop scheduled for January 6 at 1 pm would be written as July 12 at 7 pm.\n\nDespite these efforts at caution and security, he could at times be reckless. He once said in a letter to the KGB that it should emulate the management style of Mayor of Chicago Richard J. Daley – a comment that easily could have led an investigator to look at people from Chicago. He took the risk of recommending to his handlers that they try to recruit his closest friend, a colonel in the United States Army. In an early letter to Cherkashin, he claims, \"As far as the funds are concerned, I have little need or utility for more than the $100,000.\"\n\nAccording to \"USA Today\", those who knew the Hanssens described them as a close family. They attended Mass weekly and were very active in Opus Dei. Hanssen's three sons attended The Heights School in Potomac, Maryland, an all-boys preparatory school. His daughters attended Oakcrest School for Girls in Vienna, Virginia, an independent Roman Catholic school. Both schools are associated with Opus Dei. Hanssen's wife Bonnie still teaches theology at Oakcrest.\n\nA priest at Oakcrest said that Hanssen had regularly attended a 6:30 a.m. daily mass for more than a decade. Opus Dei member Father C. John McCloskey III said he also occasionally attended the daily noontime mass at the Catholic Information Center in downtown Washington. After going to prison, Hanssen claimed he periodically admitted his espionage to priests in confession. He urged fellow Catholics in the Bureau to attend mass more often and denounced the Russians, even though he was spying for them, as \"godless\".\n\nHowever, at Hanssen's suggestion, and without the knowledge of his wife, a friend named Jack Horschauer, a retired Army officer, would sometimes watch the Hanssens having sex through a bedroom window. Hanssen then began to secretly videotape his sexual encounters and shared the videotapes with Horschauer. Later, he hid a video camera in the bedroom that was connected via closed-circuit television line so that his friend could observe the Hanssens from his guest bedroom. He also explicitly described the sexual details of his marriage on Internet chat rooms, giving information sufficient for those who knew them to recognize the couple.\n\nHanssen frequently visited D.C. strip clubs, and spent a great deal of time with a Washington stripper named Priscilla Sue Galey. She went with Hanssen on a trip to Hong Kong, and on a visit to the FBI training facility in Quantico, Virginia. He gave her money, jewels, and a used Mercedes-Benz, but cut off contact with her before his arrest, when she fell into drug abuse and prostitution. Galey claims that although she offered to sleep with him, Hanssen declined, saying that he was trying to convert her to Catholicism.\n\nThe story is mentioned in Ronald Kessler's book \"The Secrets of the FBI\", both in Chapter 15, \"Catching Hanssen,\" and Chapter 16, \"Breach.\"\n\nEric O'Neill's role in the capture of Robert Hanssen was dramatized in the 2007 film \"Breach\", in which Chris Cooper played the role of Hanssen and Ryan Phillippe played O'Neill.\n\nThe 2007 documentary \"Superspy: The Man Who Betrayed the West\" describes the hunt to trap Hanssen. He also was the subject of a 2002 made-for-television movie, \"\", with the teleplay by Norman Mailer and starring William Hurt as Hanssen. Hanssen's jailers allowed him to watch this movie, but he was so angered by it that he turned it off.\n\nHanssen is mentioned in chapter 5 of Dan Brown's book \"The Da Vinci Code\", as the most noted Opus Dei member to non-members. Because of his sexual deviancy and espionage conviction, the organization's reputation was badly hurt.\n\nHanssen's story is reviewed on season 2, episode 4 of \"Mysteries at the Museum\". Actual footage of his arrest by FBI agents is included. His story is the last segment of four included in this episode.\n\nThe American Court TV (now TruTV) television series \"Mugshots\" released an episode on the Robert Hanssen case titled \"Robert Hanssen - Hanssen and the KGB\".\n\n\n"}

Critics of how Romani people have been portrayed in popular culture point out similarities to portrayals of Jewish people, with both groups stereotyped negatively as wandering, spreading disease, abducting children, and violating and murdering others.\n\nRomani people were portrayed in Victorian and modern British literature as having \"sinister occult and criminal tendencies\" and as associated with \"thievery and cunning\", and in English Renaissance and baroque theatre as incorporating \"elements of outlandish charm and elements which depict [them] as the lowest of social outcasts,\" connected with \"magic and charms,\" and \"juggling and cozening.\" In opera, literature and music, throughout Europe, Romani women have been portrayed as provocative, sexually available, gaudy, exotic and mysterious. Hollywood and European movies, as well as popular music and other forms of pop culture, have promoted similar stereotypes.\n\nParticularly notable representations of Romani people appear in classics like \"Carmen\" by Prosper Mérimée and adapted by Georges Bizet, Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" and Miguel de Cervantes' \"La Gitanilla\".\nThe Romani were also heavily romanticized in the Soviet Union, a classic example being the 1975 \"Tabor ukhodit v Nebo\".\nA more realistic depiction of contemporary Romani in the Balkans, featuring Romani lay actors speaking in their native dialects, although still playing with established clichés of a Romani penchant for both magic and crime, was presented by Emir Kusturica in his \"Time of the Gypsies\" (1988) and \"Black Cat, White Cat\" (1998). Another realistic depiction of Romanies in Yugoslavia is \"I Even Met Happy Gypsies\" (1967).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomani characters are frequently depicted in werewolf films, including Maleva the fortuneteller (Maria Ouspenskaya) in \"The Wolf Man\" and the Romani clan of female werewolves in \"Cry of the Werewolf\".\n"}

She won the U.S. State Department's 2015 International Women of Courage Award for her efforts in seeking justice for Pakistani women.\n\nTabassum Adnan was born in 1977 and grew up in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. She was a child bride at 13, mother of four and a victim of domestic violence, when she divorced her husband of 20 years. Finding herself homeless and without means of support, Adnan attended a women's empowerment program run by a local aid group. It inspired her to work to change women's ability to participate in decision-making processes. Initially she approached the male-only, main Swat Aman Jirga, but was rejected. Jirgas are traditional informal judicial councils which enforce \"qisas\", retribution laws, and though not intended to replace formal judicial systems or police procedures, decisions of the elders are socially respected and do often impact the judiciary.\n\nIn May 2013, Adnan started her own jirga, the first run by women in the country. Traditionally, women in the region have been used as chattel to settle disputes of men, traded in marriage to absolve debts, claims of honor, and retribution for crimes. Because women have little power, Adnan recognized that her group would need to pressure authorities to act. Her 25-member all-female jirga pressures police and the traditional court system to act while providing legal assistance to the victims. The \"Khwendo Jirga\", or Sister’s Council, in addition to providing justice support for women advocate for free education for girls; protection of women and girl's health; training in both traditional domestic and non-traditional vocational skills; microfinancing, access for women to peace negotiations, justice, and voting; and laws which protect women from violence, specifically, honor killings, dowry harassments, acid attacks, and torture. Initially the \"Khwendo Jirga\" was opposed both by men's jirgas and prominent women's rights activists.\n\nIn 2014 an event happened, which changed the public perception of Adnan's group. A child was raped and the authorities failed to act. \"Khwendo Jirga\" organized a protest walk bringing visibility to the case. The suspects were apprehended and for the first time in Pashtun history, a woman, Adnan, was asked to sit on the male jirga and assist with dispensing justice in the case. Since the first protest, the women have repeated the success and in July, 2014, Adnan and Khwendo Jirga were lobbying for the passage of a law prohibiting child marriages. Despite strong protest from religious factors, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a ban on marriages for anyone under the age of eighteen and in December, 2014 the Punjab Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to work on amending the present law.\n\nSince their first success with the men's jirga, Adnan has been invited to participate on other cases dealing with \"women's issues.\" Though she still receives threats Adnan continues, as she believes that women should be part of the decision-making processes that effect their lives.\n\nIn 2013, Adnan was awarded the Human Defenders Award,\nShe has won the Nelson Mandela Award 2016.\n"}

Rudolph notes that as early as in 1833, the Vanniyar, who were then known as Pallis, had ceased to accept their \"low caste\" status, more specifically described as that of shudra by Christophe Jaffrelot and Kathleen Gough. They tried to get an order in Pondicherry that by descent they were not a low agricultural caste. In preparation for the 1871 Indian census they petitioned to be recognised as being of the kshatriya (warrior) \"varna\" of Hindu society. By 1931, due to their successful politicking (a process known as sanskritisation), the term \"Palli\" was removed from the Madras census, with the term \"Vanniya Kula Kshatriya\" appearing instead.\n\nThe Pallis formed a number of caste organisations using their preferred name, with the Vanniyakula Kshatriya Maha Sangam appearing in Madras in 1888.\n\nTraditionally, most Vanniyars are agricultural labourers. Increasingly, however, they are benefiting from political influence and organisation and they now own 50 per cent of the lands of the traditional landowners. The Vanniyars who previously were of the Backward Class category, were now designated as a Most Backward Caste after successful agitations by them in the 1980s. The reason for the agitation and subsequent re-classification was to avail more government benefits for the community.\n\nThe Pattali Makkal Katchi political party was formed from the Vanniyar Sangam, a caste association. It has been known on occasion for its violent protests against Dalit people.\n\nThe Vannimai chieftains in what is now Sri Lanka arose from a multi-ethnic and multi-caste background. A primary source, the \"Yalpana Vaipava Malai\", states that some were descended from Vanniyar caste immigrants from modern Tamil Nadu. Some Sri Lankan historians derive the title \"Vannimai\" from the Tamil word \"vanam\", meaning \"forest\", with \"Vannia\" or \"Wannia\" meaning \"person from the forest\", and \"Vannimais\" being large tracts of forested land.\n\nMany castes today claim descent from Malayaman. Dennis B. McGilvray states \"Malayaman is a section of the Udaiyar caste in South Arcot today, but Burton Stein also finds the title in a thirteenth-century inscription identifying Vanniyar subcastes of South Arcot in the left-right caste classification typical of the Chola empire.\"\n\n\n"}

He remained a strong critic of President Pervez Musharraf, eventually taking up a leading role in Lawyer's movement in 2007 to oppose President Musharraf. Ultimately, he unsuccessfully ran for the presidential elections held in 2007. Since 2011, he has been active in national politics through Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), being the party's candidate for the presidential election 2013. He lost the election on 30 July 2013 to Mamnoon Hussain of Pakistan Muslim League (N).\n\nWajihuddin Ahmed was born into an Urdu-speaking practising lawyer family in New Delhi, British India, on 1 December 1938. His father, Waheeduddin Ahmed, was also a jurist and had held a prestigious in Delhi High Court; his family migrated to Pakistan after independence in 1947. His father, Waheeduddin Ahmed, rose up to become a respected judge, eventually securing appointments as Chief Justice of Sindh High Court and subsequently appointed as senior justice of Supreme Court of Pakistan.\n\nUpon settling in Karachi, Wajihuddin Ahmed attended and matriculated from Sindh Islamic Monastery, moving Lahore Punjab for his further studies. He enrolled at the Forman Christian College University where he attained BA in Liberal Arts in 1962. In 1963, he enrolled in Sindh Muslim College to read law and eventually graduated with LLB degree in 1966. In 1967, he began his doctoral studies in law at the Karachi University; he was awarded JD degree by Karachi University in 1971.\n\nHe avoided holding any judicial office, whether elected or appointed, during his father's tenure as a judge. Therefore, he remained associated with the SM College as a professor of law, delivering lectures and teaching law for undergraduate and post-graduate level courses.\n\nSon of highly reputed Chief Justice of West Pakistan High Court and Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Justice \"Waheeduddin Ahmed\", Justice Wajih enrolled as an advocate of the Sindh High Court and remained Lecturer at the SM Law College for LL. B. and LL. M. classes. He was consecutively elected as president Sindh High Court Bar Association unopposed in 1977 and 1978 and elected President of Karachi Bar association in 1981. Advocate Wajih was appointed Standing Council for Federal Government in 1984 and Advocate General Sindh on 19 November 1986 and elevated to the Bench of the SHC as a Judge in 1988. He became the Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court from 5 November 1997 to 4 May 1998 and moved to the Supreme Court in 1998. During his tenure as SHC CJ, most sou moto actions were taken. He acted as Returning Officer during 1997 Presidential Elections and then appeared as presidential candidate against Musharraf in 2007.\nJustice Wajih joined the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on 10 January 2011.\n\nHe is deeply involved in human rights issues and judicial education, and has spent much of his private time since retirement on dealing with constitutional concerns.

{"id": "401875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401875", "title": "Welfare reform", "text": "Welfare reform\n\nWelfare reforms are changes in the operation of a given welfare system, with the goals of reducing the number of individuals dependent on government assistance, keeping the welfare systems affordable, and assisting recipients become self-sufficient. Classical liberals, libertarians, and conservatives generally argue that welfare and other tax-funded services reduce incentives to work, exacerbate the free-rider problem, and intensify poverty. Socialists, on the other hand, generally criticize welfare reform because it usually minimizes the public safety net, and strengthens the capitalist economic system. Welfare reform is constantly debated because of the varying opinions on the government's determined balance of providing guaranteed welfare benefits, and promoting self-sufficiency.\n\nWithin the last two decades, welfare systems have been under extreme scrutiny around the world. Demographic changes like the post-war \"baby boom\" followed by the subsequent “baby bust,” coupled with economic shifts such as the 1970 oil shocks, led to aging populations and a dwindling working force. In turn, there became an increased dependency on social welfare systems, which inevitably brought up the issue of welfare reform. U.S systems primarily focused on reducing poor single-parents need for welfare, through employment incentives. The U.K focused primarily on reducing general unemployment through the New Deal. The Netherlands emphasized reforming disability programs, and Latin America focused primarily on pension reforms.\n\nGerman Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was one political leader who attempted to put an end to socialism by proposing government healthcare. He approved the 1883 Health Insurance Act which was the first to introduce compulsory government-monitored health insurance. The German legislation ensured contributory retirement and disability benefits. Participation became mandatory. Many historians trace the beginnings of contemporary welfare in Europe and America to Bismarck's Health Insurance law. However, this welfare program intended for the working class was practiced by the Roman Empire, China's Song Dynasty, and the 7th Century Islamic System. In the United States, the Great Depression and 1929 crash of the stock market contributed significantly to the formation of the concept of welfare as many Americans struggled economically during those times.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson declared his administration's War on Poverty in 1964 as the poverty rate increased by 19%. He funded welfare programs like Social Security, Food Stamps, Job Corps, and Head Start. The War on Poverty included programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. It provided the first direct federal assistance for school districts, milestone environmental law, urban renewal, civil rights, subsidy for bilingual education, and national donations for arts and humanities.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon's administration proposed the 1969 Family Assistance Plan, which would require all welfare recipients, excluding mothers with children under the age of three, to work. This program stopped in 1972 and liberals criticized the plan for providing too little support, and requiring too strict of work regulations. Instead of welfare reforms, the government ended up providing major expansions to welfare programs during this presidency.\n\nIn 1980, President Ronald Reagan cut Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) spending and gave states the option of requiring welfare recipients to participate in workfare programs. Charles Murray's book Losing Ground: American Social Policy, 1950–1980 (1984) argued that the Welfare state actually harms the poor, especially single-parent families, by making them increasingly dependent on the government, and discouraging them from working. Murray proposed that current welfare programs be replaced by short-term local programs. \nOn August 22, 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA). Clinton's reform aligned closely with Charles Murray. In his 1992 campaign Clinton promised to “end welfare as we have come to know it.” Staying true to his promise, he instated one of the most well-known welfare reforms in US History. PRWORA instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF) to replace the AFDC, the former welfare program providing cash to poor families since 1935. TANF instated work restrictions in order for recipients to qualify for aid. TANF also shifted welfare to the state governments, where each state was given an allocation of money to be used for this program, as long as there existed work requirements, and a five-year limit for families on welfare. The general premise behind this reform was that aid should not be a one-way handout.\n\nState governments have established and currently administer welfare programs for the welfare of the impoverished but operating in accordance with guidelines of the federal government. Funds for these programs are remitted to states in the form of block grants giving them more flexibility in making decisions on how money will be allocated among different welfare programs.\n\nIn recent years reform of the welfare system in Britain began with the introduction of the New Deal programme introduced by the Labour government in 1997. The aim of this programme was to increase employment through requiring that recipients make serious efforts to seek employment. The Labour Party also introduced a system of tax credits for low-income workers.\n\nThe Welfare Reform Act 2007 provides for \"an employment and support allowance, a contributory allowance, [and] an income-based allowance.\".\nThe objectives of the Welfare Reform Act of 2007 were to increase the employment rate to 80% from 75%, to assist 300,000 single parents find employment, to increase the number of workers over 50 by 1 million, and to reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefits by 1 million.\n\nThis welfare reform proposed an increase of personal responsibility within the welfare system. The reform eliminated Income support, and allocated funds over to the Jobseeker's allowance, to encourage employment. It also encouraged increased parental responsibility by amending child support laws, and requiring births be registered jointly by both parents.\n\nThis welfare reform proposed changes to the Housing Benefit, which reduced the benefit paid to recipients depending on the size of their living space. This act got the nickname of the “Bedroom Tax.” from the media. It was stated that similarly to other welfare reforms, this act would reduce welfare dependency.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1970s, a deficit in the social insurance program began to appear. The deficit saw peaks at 27.75% of the social insurance budget in 1992. This led to a major push by the government to cut back spending in the welfare program. By the end of the 1990s the deficit had been almost completely eradicated. The often large deficits that the program has endured has led to a tremendous amount of opposition to the program as it stands.\n\nDuring the 2015–2018 Brazilian economic crisis, there has been both economic and political turmoil. President Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached and replaced by President Michel Temer, strived to expand the social welfare program Bolsa Família instated by her predecessor Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. As a social-democrat, Rousseff pledged that \"Brazil will continue to grow, with social inclusion and mobility.\" When Michel Temer took office, to cope with the severe economic recession, he proposed social welfare reforms to change labor rules and the social security pension system. Temer's plan included limiting pension benefits and raising the retirement age in order to save money and fix the economy. Additionally, under his reform, companies have greater power to require longer work days and use part-time workers. In response to this reform, labor unions, rural workers, and government employees held protests all over Brazil. The vote to approve the pension reform was first suspended until February 2018, and now has been further postponed as a campaign issue in this year's election. Temer's critics believe that the reason for the postponed reform is its vast public disapproval.\n\n"}
