However, the preceding year, 1984, actually had more arrests for espionage in the United States.\n\nThe eight major agents who became infamous in 1985 for espionage against the United States were John Anthony Walker, Richard Kelly Smyth, Sharon W. Scranage, Larry Wu-Tai Chin, Jonathan Jay Pollard, Ronald William Pelton, Randy Miles Jeffries, and Edward Lee Howard.\n\nThe majority of these operatives were spying for Communist nations. Their arrests in 1985 heightened tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union at a crucial point in the Cold War; Mikhail Gorbachev rose to power as Soviet general secretary in the same year.\n\nThese high-publicity cases added to the American public's suspicion of the Soviets at a time when the Soviet Union was transitioning into new leadership and reforms under Gorbachev. Even Gorbachev's meeting with President Ronald Reagan at the November Geneva Summit did little to reduce uncertainty as to the future of U.S.-Soviet relations.\n\nThe arrest of so many foreign spies working within the United States Intelligence Community sparked two demands among the American public: more internal government security and protection against infiltration, and more and better public access to government information.\n\nAs a result, journalists and researchers who had been demanding and obtaining government information sought to store it in one central location and in 1985 created the National Security Archive at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.\n\nJohn Anthony Walker was born on July 28, 1937, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Margaret Scaramuzzo and James Vincent Walker. James drank heavily and frequently beat Margaret and their children.\n\nAs a child, John Anthony Walker was a rebellious practical joker. At his Catholic high school, he performed poorly academically and did not participate in sports. When he was 17, he was arrested for robbing a gas station, and he admitted to six other burglaries. In court his older brother, a US Navy petty officer, urged the judge to give him probation so that he might enlist in the Navy and gain discipline.\n\nWalker enlisted in the Navy in 1956.\n\nIn 1967, he walked into the Soviet embassy in Washington, DC and offered to steal codes, code machines, and classified documents from the Navy for the initial price of $500 to $1000 per week.\n\nHe later recruited his wife Barbara, his friend Jerry Whitworth, his older brother Arthur, and his son Michael to aid him in his espionage activities.\n\nBarbara eventually disclosed the ring's activities to the FBI. After completing a dead drop coordinated with a Soviet operative north of Washington, DC, Walker searched for $200,000 that the Soviet operative was supposed to have dropped five miles away. He could not find the package, and checked into a local inn to regroup. The FBI had arranged a sting. The hotel's front desk worker lured him from his room at 3:30 a.m. on May 20, 1985, with a phone call about damage to his van in the hotel’s parking lot, at which point two FBI agents apprehended him.\n\nThe Walker case stunned America as the last major spy case involving Americans was the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case of the 1950s.\n\nRichard Kelly Smyth was an American physicist, businessman, and NATO and NASA consultant on aerospace guidance technology. His Huntington Beach, California, business, Milco International Incorporated, was a leading contractor to the US government on aerospace technology and an exporter of this technology.\n\nBetween January 1980 and December 1982, Smyth allegedly illegally exported 15 shipments of 810 krytrons total to alleged Israeli-intermediary, businessman (and film producer) Arnon Milchan of the Israeli company Heli Trading Company. Milchan then allegedly mediated the transfer of the krytrons to the Israeli government.\n\nBecause krytrons are electronic switches capable of triggering nuclear explosive devices, the US government deems them munitions and only allows their legal export via a stringent licensing process, though krytrons much smaller than those Smyth exported are central components of common items like copy machines and strobe lights.\n\nOperation Exodus, a US Customs program, was instrumental in Smyth’s capture. Ronald Reagan's administration designed Operation Exodus to cut off smuggling of technology and goods to Soviet countries and funded the program by taking $30 million from the Department of Defense and giving it to Customs.\n\nSmyth was arrested in May 1985 but he fled with his wife while awaiting trial. The couple was discovered in Málaga, Spain in July 2001. After his extradition to the US, he pleaded guilty in December 2001 to violating the Arms Export Control Act and to making false statements to US Customs. His sentence included 40 months in prison and a $20,000 fine, though he was immediately eligible for parole because of his old age. He was 72 at the time of sentencing.\n\nThe high drama of the covert relationship between Richard Kelly Smyth, Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan, and the entire episode that became known as the Krytron affair, was documented in the 2011 book \"Confidential, The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan\".\n\nSharon W. Scranage was a young American CIA secretary serving in Accra, the capital of Ghana. The Ghanaian government used Michael Agbotui Soussoudis, a young male intelligence officer to target her, romance her, and solicit US intelligence from her.\n\nScranage disclosed to Soussoudis the identities of undercover CIA agents working in Ghana as well as plans for a coup against the Ghanaian government by dissidents. Soussoudis then passed the information to Ghanaian intelligence chief and Marxist Kojo Tsikata, who then passed it to Cuba, Libya, and East Germany.\n\nAccording to a study by the Adjudicative Desk Reference, the US government’s guidelines for a person’s eligibility for access to classified information, it is not uncommon for foreign intelligence agents, especially in Communist nations, to use the promise of sex and romance against operatives to gain trust and obtain information.\n\nOn September 27, 1985 Scranage began her sentence of 5 years in prison for espionage and violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act. She earned parole after serving 18 months. Soussoudis received a sentence of 20 years but permanently left the US in exchange for a suspended sentence.\n\nCongress passed the Intelligence Identities Protection Act in 1982 in response to the murder of Athens, Greece CIA station chief Richard Welch by Marxist group The 17 November Organization. The legislation made it illegal to disclose the identities of or personal information about intelligence officers.\n\nLarry Wu-Tai Chin was born in Beijing. He began his US government career as translator for the US Army during World War II. He performed the same job for the US Consulate in Shanghai, the State Department, and the CIA’s Foreign Broadcast Information Service.\n\nHe spied for China for 30 years. He told the Chinese government Richard Nixon's secret diplomatic goals before Nixon's visit to China, and China was able to strategically prepare for negotiations. Chinese intelligence agents then passed Chin’s secrets on to the Vietnamese.\n\nChina paid Chin between $500,000 and $1 million, with which he accumulated 29 rental properties and Las Vegas gambling debts totaling more than $96,000. Chin channeled his compulsive gambling habit and used it as a way to hide his espionage profits.\n\nAfter federal district judge Robert Mehrige found him guilty of spying for China on February 7, 1986, Chin suffocated himself with a plastic bag in his Virginia prison cell.\n\nJonathan Jay Pollard, son of a microbiology professor, grew up in South Bend, Indiana. As a child he loved to read and tell stories. His family lost 70 relatives during the Holocaust, and he dreamed of avenging these wrongs. He attended Stanford University where he falsely boasted that Israeli intelligence paid his tuition and his father worked for the CIA.\n\nAfter leaving graduate school at Tufts University, he became a civilian US Naval intelligence officer in 1979. He earned a promotion in 1984 and immediately passed satellite imagery and CIA reports to Israeli agents, unsolicited. Apart from cash, he received jewelry and a honeymoon on the Orient Express for his wife Anne Henderson.\n\nPollard reportedly admitted to selling materials that could fill a 10-foot by 6-foot by 6-foot space to the Israeli Intelligence, from where, it is claimed some intelligence specialists believe that the Soviet moles then passed those secrets along to Moscow.\n\nPollard’s need to constantly handle classified materials drew too much attention, and he was arrested by the FBI on November 18, 1985. He pleaded guilty to espionage and received a sentence of life in prison on June 4, 1986. After Anne served her 5-year sentence for unauthorized possession of government documents, she divorced Pollard.\n\nIn April 2008, federal prosecutors accused 84-year-old retired US Army engineer and New Jersey resident Ben-Ami Kadish of passing intelligence to an Israeli official who also received information from Pollard.\n\nRonald William Pelton was born in 1942. After attending Indiana University, he joined the US Air Force and analyzed SIGINT in Pakistan. He had a photographic memory.\n\nHe began working for the National Security Agency as a communications specialist in 1966. He personally went to the Soviet embassy in Washington, DC and volunteered to spy after he retired in 1979.\n\nHe eventually disclosed to the Soviets intelligence about Operation Ivy Bells, a plan to monitor underwater Soviet communication cables. At the time, the information Pelton had disclosed was so sensitive that CIA director Bill Casey and NSA director William Odom asked the media to report any leaked information to them before going to press.\n\nAlleged Soviet defector Vitaly Yurchenko was a KGB colonel who revealed Pelton’s identity during an interrogation by the CIA.\n\nPelton received three concurrent life sentences in 1986.\n\nRandy Miles Jeffries worked as a clerk for the FBI from 1978 to 1980. In 1983 he received a one-year suspended sentence for heroin possession and attended rehab. A social service worker referred him to Acme Reporting Company, a stenography and reporting company that frequently contracted with federal agencies. Here Jeffries was responsible for photocopying, bundling, and handling classified documents and later disposing of them, unshredded, in a dumpster.\n\nOn December 14, 1985, Jeffries conspired with a coworker to attempt to sell to the Soviet Military Office in northwest Washington three classified documents including one titled “US House of Representatives, Department of Defense Command Control Communication and Intelligence Programs, C31, Closed Session, Subcommittee on Armed Services, Washington, DC.” At 4:45 p.m. he hand-delivered sample documents to the Soviet Military Office. He returned on December 17, at which time Soviet agents paid him $60. On December 20 he met with an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a Soviet. Law enforcement arrested Jeffries later that night.\n\nA subsequent federal audit of Acme Reporting Company revealed that their security system was a total failure. Background checks were inadequate, employees worked on classified materials from home, and no proper document destruction procedures were in place.\n\nIn response to the Jeffries case, the Defense Investigative Service started Project Insight in 1986 to gather and analyze industrial security data and develop recommendations for new techniques.\n\nOn March 13, 1986, a federal judge sentenced Jeffries to 3 to 9 years imprisonment.\n\nEdward Lee Howard was a Boy Scout, an altar boy, and a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer who served in Colombia. After a period spent doing international development work with USAID, Howard went to work for the CIA in 1981.\n\nOn May 2, 1983, the CIA fired him after noting discrepancies in his polygraph tests regarding past drug use and petty theft. Howard promptly made drunken phone calls to the US embassy in Moscow using a phone line he knew Soviets were monitoring, and thereby exposed his former supervisor as a CIA employee.\n\nIn 1984 Howard allegedly sold US intelligence to KGB agents in Austria. In 1985 he vanished into the New Mexico desert after Soviet defector and KGB deputy chief Vitaly Yurchenko gave the FBI information which caused them to heavily surveil Howard. Howard escaped with the help of his wife Mary, who drove home from the desert with a dummy decoy in the passenger seat of the car, and played a recording of Howard's voice on a phone line she knew the FBI was tapping.\n\nHoward defected to Russia where the Soviets granted him asylum, an apartment, and a new identity.\n\nHoward died on July 12, 2002, at the age of 50, according to former KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and State Department spokesman Richard A. Boucher.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3025600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3025600", "title": "American Coaster Enthusiasts", "text": "American Coaster Enthusiasts\n\nAmerican Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) is a non-profit organization focusing on the enjoyment, knowledge, and preservation of roller coasters as well as recognition of some as architectural and engineering landmarks. Dues paying members receive the quarterly magazine \"RollerCoaster!\" and bi-monthly newsletter \"ACE News\". Amusement parks have also invited members to exclusive ride events at amusement parks as well as sneak peek events at new roller coasters under construction. \n\nThe organization maintains an online database of roller coasters including ride specifications and archives of published news articles. The club also recognizes of historically significant roller coasters with Coaster Classic and ACE Roller Coaster Landmark statuses.\n\nOrganization founders Roy Brashears, Paul Greenwald and Richard Munch met at a roller coaster riding marathon event promoting of the 1977 movie \"Rollercoaster\" at the \"Rebel Yell\" roller coaster (now titled Racer 75) at Kings Dominion amusement park in Doswell, Virginia. The three discovered they shared the same passion for roller coasters and decided to form a club that would allow others that shared the same interests to join. They organized Coaster Con I the following year at Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park in June 1978. On the final day of the event during a business meeting, the name American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) was chosen as the club's name. Coaster Con events have been held annually ever since \n\nThe organization is almost entirely run by volunteers, with the exception of an independent contractor who runs certain day-to-day operations regarding mailings, receipt of event payment/membership dues and merchandise. ACE members are required to pay annual membership dues that are available in individual, couple, family and corporate packages. The organization fulfills one of its primary goals of providing education through its publications. Other goals include promoting the conservation, appreciation, and enjoyment of roller coasters and their place in history as architectural and engineering landmarks.\n\nACE is governed by an executive committee of five officers and six directors. Four of the officer positions are directly elected and one indirectly elected by the club's membership. These officers are the President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary and Immediate Past President. The six directors are appointed by the president and approved by a majority vote of the remaining officers. The Regional Representation Director, oversees a system of ACE regions, which sponsors events and publishes regional websites and newsletters.\n\nACE Regions\n\nThe national organization sponsors the annual Coaster Con convention, international tours, seasonal conferences, and a conference focused on coaster preservation. \n\nCoaster Con, usually features one to as many as six theme parks where exclusive ride time is made available to members on selected coasters outside of times when the park is open to the public. Coaster Con also features photo and video contests, carnival games competitions, as well as an annual business meeting, banquet (with presentations, awards, industry keynote speaker, and auction to benefit ACE's funds), workshops, discussion groups, displays, and memorabilia sales tables.\n\nThe ACE Coaster Classic award was developed during a period when changes in the design, equipping, and operation of wood coasters threatened to erase these time-honored experiences and rituals. The award is designed to recognize coasters that still adhere to these principles, while allowing riders to safely experience the thrill of the classic wooden roller coaster ride. To be eligible for ACE Coaster Classic status, the coaster must meet the following criteria:\n\nThe amusement park or theme park operating a coaster that is recognized as a Coaster Classic is usually presented a custom plaque. The plaque typically states:\nIt has been noted, however, that most coasters usually have disqualifying ratcheting lap bars, seat dividers and head rests to prevent people from trying to stand up during ride. For example, Rolling Thunder at Six Flags Great Adventure had buzz bars which meet traditional lap bar Coaster Classic requirements, but it is \"not\" a classic because of headrests and seat dividers being added in 1981 to prevent people from standing up during the ride.\n\nIn 2002, ACE introduced the Roller Coaster Landmark award. The award is designed to recognize coasters of historic significance that may not qualify for ACE Coaster Classic status.\n\nThe Golden Age Coaster award, a prequel to the Roller Coaster Landmark award, was established to recognize significant roller coasters that were built during the 1920s. Giant Dipper at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk received the Golden Age Coaster award in addition to the Roller Coaster Landmark award. Giant Dipper at Belmont Park (San Diego) also received the Golden Age Coaster award.\n\nACE takes an active role in the preservation of endangered roller coasters. Since 1985, the club has either directly or indirectly helped save more than half a dozen. One of the most notable include the Phoenix located at Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, Pennsylvania. The wooden coaster was relocated from Playland Park in San Antonio, Texas. Another the organization saved was Leap the Dips, the world's oldest operating wooden coaster, located at Lakemont Park in Altoona, Pennsylvania. In addition to preservation, some parks have also sought the opinions of ACE members regarding roller coaster design, as was the case with The Legend at Holiday World in Santa Claus, Indiana.\n\n"}

On February 24, 2015 Anthem raised the number to 78.8 million people whose personal information was affected. According to Anthem, Inc., the data breach extended into multiple brands Anthem, Inc. uses to market its healthcare plans, including, Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Amerigroup, Caremore, and UniCare. Healthlink says it was also a victim. Anthem says the medical information and financial data was not compromised. Anthem has offered free credit monitoring in the wake of the breach. According to Bloomberg News, China may be responsible for this data breach. Michael Daniel, chief adviser on cybersecurity for President Barack Obama, said he would be changing his own password. According to \"The New York Times\" about 80 million company records were hacked, and there is fear that the stolen data will be used for identity theft. The compromised information contained names, birthdays, medical IDs, social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data.\n\nThe data was stolen over a period of weeks the month before the data breach was discovered.\n\nAnthem was not required by law to encrypt the data.

Anthem had a million insurance policy for cyber problems from American International Group. One report suggested that all of this money could be consumed by the process of notifying customers of the breach.\n\nAnthem advised people whose data was stolen to monitor their accounts and remain vigilant.\n\nAnthem retained Mandiant to review their security systems.\n\nThe theft of the data raised fears generally about the theft of medical information. A writer from Harvard Law School suggested that this data breach might spark reform of security practices and government data safety regulation.\n\nAn investigation conducted by several state insurance commissioners blames the breach on an attacker whose identity was withheld, and claims that the breach was likely ordered by a foreign government whose name was withheld. It also concluded that Anthem had taken reasonable measures to protect its data before the breach and that its remediation plan was effective at shutting down the breach once it was discovered. It also marks the starting date of the breach as February 18, 2014.\n\nA class action settlement is in the process of notifying potential victims on a rolling basis through October 30, 2017, see Data Breach Litigation\n\n"}
{"id": "50213084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50213084", "title": "Anti-union violence in the United States", "text": "Anti-union violence in the United States\n\nAnti-union violence in the United States is physical force intended to harm union officials, union organizers, union members, union sympathizers, or their families. It has most commonly been used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.\n\nViolence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, intimidation, impersonation, disinformation, and sabotage. Violence in labor disputes may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated, for example the hiring and deployment of goon squads to intimidate, threaten or even assault strikers.\n\nHistorically, violence against unions has included attacks by detective and guard agencies, such as the Pinkertons, Baldwin Felts, Burns, or Thiel detective agencies; citizens groups, such as the Citizens' Alliance; company guards; police; national guard; or even the military. In particular, there are few curbs on what detective agencies are able to get away with. In the book \"From Blackjacks To Briefcases\", Robert Michael Smith states that during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, anti-union agencies spawned violence and wreaked havoc on the labor movement. One investigator who participated in a congressional inquiry into industrial violence in 1916 concluded that,\nEspionage is closely related to violence. Sometimes it is the direct cause of violence, and, where that cannot be charged, it is often the indirect cause. If the secret agents of employers, working as members of the labor unions, do not always investigate acts of violence, they frequently encourage them. If they did not, they would not be performing the duties for which they are paid, for they are hired on the theory that labor organizations are criminal in character.\nIn U.S. Senate testimony in 1936 about an employer who wanted to contract with the Pinkerton agency. Known personally to the author of the book \"The Pinkerton Story\", this employer was characterized as a \"sincerely upright and Godly man.\" Yet Pinkerton files record that the employer wanted the agency \"to send in some thugs who could beat up the strikers.\" In 1936, the Pinkerton agency changed its focus from strike-breaking to undercover services. Pinkerton declined the request from this employer.\n\nAccording to Morris Friedman, detective agencies were themselves for-profit companies, and a \"bitter struggle\" between capital and labor could be counted upon to create \"satisfaction and immense profit\" for agencies such as the Pinkerton company. Such agencies were in the perfect position to fan suspicion and mistrust \"into flames of blind and furious hatred\" on the part of the companies.\n\nHarry Wellington Laidler wrote a book in 1913 detailing how one of the largest union busters in the United States, Corporations Auxiliary Company, had a sales pitch offering the use of provocation and violence. The agency would routinely tell employers — prospective clients — of the methods used by their undercover operatives,\nOnce the union is in the field its members can keep it from growing if they know how, and our man knows how. Meetings can be set far apart. A contract can at once be entered into with the employer, covering a long period, and made very easy in its terms. However, these tactics may not be good, and the union spirit may be so strong that a big organization cannot be prevented. In this case our man turns extremely radical. He asks for unreasonable things and keeps the union embroiled in trouble. If a strike comes, he will be the loudest man in the bunch, and will counsel violence and get somebody in trouble. The result will be that the union will be broken up.\"\n\nSome anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the 1912 textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing Anna LoPizzo.\n\nAnti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the hanging of union organizer Frank Little from a railroad trestle in Butte, Montana. A note was pinned to his body which said, \"Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!\" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the \"L\" for Frank Little circled.\n\nAnti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the Anaconda Road Massacre. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.\n\nThe unprovoked attack was similar to another event, which had occurred twenty-three years earlier in Pennsylvania. During the Lattimer massacre, nineteen unarmed immigrant coal miners were suddenly gunned down at the Lattimer mine near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 1897. The miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and German ethnicity, were shot and killed by a Luzerne County sheriff's posse. In this group as well, all of the miners had been shot in the back. The shooting followed a brief tussle over the American flag carried by the miners. Their only crime was asserting their right to march in the face of demands that they disperse.\n\nIn 1927, during a coal strike in Colorado, state police and mine guards fired pistols, rifles and a machine gun into a group of five hundred striking miners and their wives in what came to be called the Columbine Mine Massacre. In this incident as well, many of the miners were immigrants, and there had been a disagreement over the question of trespassing onto company property in the town of Serene, with the miners asserting it was public property because of the post office. There was, once again, a tussle over American flags carried by the strikers.\n\nWhile the Columbine mine shooting was a surprise, newspapers played a deadly role in conjuring the atmosphere of hate in which the violence occurred. Lurid editorials attacked the ethnicity of the strikers. Newspapers began calling for the governor to no longer withhold the \"mailed fist\", to strike hard and strike swiftly, and for \"Machine Guns Manned By Willing Shooters\" at more of the state's coal mines. Within days of these editorials, state police and mine guards fired on the miners and their wives, injuring dozens and killing six.\n\nIn all of the above incidents, the perpetrators were never caught, or went unpunished. An exception resulted from a shooting of strikers at the Williams & Clark Fertilizing Company near the Liebig Fertilizer Works at Carteret, New Jersey in 1915. One striker was killed outright, and more than twenty were injured in an unprovoked attack when deputies fired on strikers who had stopped a train to check for strikebreakers. The strikers found no strikebreakers, and were cheering as they exited the train. Forty deputies approached and suddenly fired on them with revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. As the strikers ran, \"the deputies ... pursued, firing again and again.\" According to attending physicians, all the strikers' wounds were on the backs or legs, indicating the guards were pursuing them. A local government official who witnessed the shooting called it entirely unprovoked. Four more of the strikers, all critically injured, would die. Twenty-two of the guards were arrested and the crime was investigated by a Grand Jury; nine deputies were subsequently convicted of manslaughter.\n\nOther anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the Ludlow Massacre. During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the \"Death Special\". At the Forbes tent colony,\n\"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes...\" \nAfter deaths of women and children at Ludlow,\n[T]he backlash was vicious and bloody. Over the next ten days striking miners poured out their rage in attacks across the coalfields... \nThe U.S. Army was called upon to put an end to the violence, and the strike sputtered to an end that December.\n\nAnti-union violence may be devious and subtle, as when union busting specialist Martin Jay Levitt assigned confederates to scratch up cars in the parking lot of a nursing home during an organizing drive, and then blamed it on the union as part of an anti-union campaign.\nAs a result of Operative Smith's \"clever and intelligent\" work, a number of union organizers received severe beatings at the hands of unknown masked men, presumably in the employ of the company.\nFriedman offers examples of these incidents:\nAbout February 13, 1904, William Farley, of Alabama, a member of the [UMWA] National Executive Board ... and the personal representative of [UMWA] President Mitchell ... addressed coal miners' meetings ... [on their return trip] eight masked men held them up with revolvers, dragged them from their wagon, threw them to the ground, beat them, kicked them, and almost knocked them into insensibility.\nAnd,\nOn Saturday, April 30, 1904, W.M. Wardjon, a national organizer of the United Mine Workers, while on board a train en route to Pueblo, was assaulted by three men at Sargents, about thirty miles west of Salida. Mr. Wardjon was beaten into unconsciousness.\nMorris Friedman accused the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I), operated by John D. Rockefeller and his lieutenant in Colorado, Jesse Welborn, of responsibility for the beatings during the 1903-04 strike.\n\nSometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by Victor Reuther and others in 1937, \"[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized tear gas attacks and mounted charges.\"\n\nA study of industrial violence in 1969 concluded, \"There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904.\"\n\nAbout the middle of February, 1904, leadership of the Colorado National Guard became concerned that the Mine Owners were failing to cover the payroll of the soldiers. General Reardon ordered Major Ellison to take another soldier he could trust to \"hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine\" in order to convince the mine owners to pay. The implication of the secrecy was, the incident would then be blamed on the union.\n\nHowever, Major Ellison reported that the miners took a route out of the mine that would not make ambush possible. Reardon ordered Ellison to pursue an alternative plan, which was shooting up one of the mines. Major Ellison and Sergeant Gordon Walter fired sixty shots into two mine buildings. The plan worked, and the mine owners paid up. Ellison would later testify (in October 1904) that General Reardon informed him \nAdjutant General Sherman Bell and Colorado Governor James Peabody knew about the plan. Major Ellison's testimony about the shooting plot, and about the staged attacks on striking miners, was corroborated by two other soldiers.\n\nProfessor James H. Brewster, a faculty attorney with the University of Colorado who was investigating the strike for Governor Ammons, was aware that militia Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt was guilty of abuse and beatings of innocent citizens, including a small Greek boy \"whose head was split open\". Professor Brewster sent a telegram to Governor Ammons requesting Linderfelt's removal. No action was taken. In a subsequent face to face meeting with the governor, three months prior to the Ludlow Massacre, Brewster again insisted that Linderfelt be removed, but again, Ammons declined. In later testimony, Professor Brewster stated that Linderfelt was the reason for the massacre. On the day that the Ludlow Massacre occurred, Lieutenant Karl Linderfelt, commander of one of two companies of the Colorado National Guard, had Louis Tikas, leader of the Ludlow tent colony of striking miners, at gunpoint. Tikas was unarmed, and the miners would later explain that he approached the militia to ask them to stop shooting. While two militiamen held Tikas, Linderfelt broke a rifle butt over his head. Tikas and two other captured miners were later found shot dead. Tikas had been shot in the back. Their bodies lay along the Colorado and Southern railroad tracks for three days in full view of passing trains. The militia officers refused to allow them to be moved until a local of a railway union demanded the bodies be taken away for burial. A court martial found Lieutenant Linderfelt guilty of assaulting Tikas with a Springfield rifle, \"but attaches no criminality thereto. And the court does therefor acquit him.\"\n\nIn 1916, the Commission on Industrial Relations, created by the U.S. Congress, issued a final report on its investigation of industrial unrest. On the question of violence in industrial disputes, the Commission stated, in part,\nMany instances of the use of physical force by the agents of employers have ... come before the Commission, indicating a relatively wide use, particularly in isolated communities.\n\nBy the early 1900s, public tolerance for violence during labor disputes began to decrease. Yet violence involving strikebreaking troops and armed guards continued into the 1930s. The level of violence that anti-union agencies engaged in eventually resulted in their tactics becoming increasingly public, for there were a very great number of newspaper and muckraking articles written about such incidents. Resources that once were allocated to overt control over workforces began to be assigned to other methods of control, such as industrial espionage. After the Great Depression in 1929, the public no longer considered companies unassailable. Yet legislation related to employer strategies such as violent strike breaking would have to wait until after World War II. Beginning in the 1950s, employers began to embrace new methods of managing workers and unions which were still effective, but much more subtle.\n\nA 1969 study of labor conflict violence in the United States examined the era following the 1947 passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, and noted that attacks on strikers by company guards had all but disappeared. Violence still occurs in labor disputes, for example, when one side miscalculates. Bringing in outside security forces, as one example, can lead to violence in modern labor disputes.\n\nThe use of cameras and camcorders may affect levels of violence in labor disputes today.\n\n\nSometimes, threats of violence cause damage to union members or supporters. Other times, threats against unions or their members may backfire. For example, Indiana Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Cox was fired after suggesting that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker should use live ammunition against pro-union protesters involved in the 2011 Wisconsin protests. More recently, a Deputy Prosecutor in Indiana's Johnson County, Carlos Lam, suggested that Governor Walker should mount a \"false flag\" operation which would make it \"appear\" as if the union was committing violence. After initially claiming that his email account was hacked, Lam admitted to sending the suggestion and resigned.\n\nCullen Werwie, press secretary for Governor Walker, states that Walker's office was unaware of Lam's email. According to CBS News, Werwie also commented, \"Certainly we do not support the actions suggested in (the) email. Governor Walker has said time and again that the protesters have every right to have their voice heard, and for the most part the protests have been peaceful. We are hopeful that the tradition will continue.\"\n\n"}

As a noun, the law of ayni states that everything in the world is connected, and is the only commandment that rules daily life in many communities like the Q'ero. As a verb, this often refers to the cooperation between the members of a community when one member gives to another, he or she is entitled to receive something back. Well-known practitioners of Ayni include the Quechuas and Aymara, as well as numerous other tribes that live in the Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia.\n\nIn communities like the Q'ero, five principles define the Andean way of life: \"munay\" (to love), \"yachay\" (to learn, know, and remember), \"llan'kay\" (to work), \"kawsay\" (life), and \"ayni\" (reciprocity). Among them, ayni is regarded as the most important principle, as it provides the backbone of life. This is because ayni is not limited to being compensated for earlier help; a more broad definition of ayni would be the exchange of energy between humans, nature, and the universe.\n\nAn example of this would be ayni between a human and a tree: A tree is watered by a human, and the tree uses this water to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. The oxygen is used by humans to perform respiration and survive, and some glucose may eventually find its way into products that humans use such as fruits. In return, humans convert oxygen back to carbon dioxide for use by the tree, as well as plant seeds the tree produced to create more trees. The simple of act of watering a tree can also reap in rewards including by not limited to: creating shade, wind barriers, soil anchors, and more. The relationships that can be defined as ayni thus extend to everything beneficial involving two parties.\n\nIn practice, Quechua and Aymara communities apply ayni through human to human interaction. This is thought to have originated from the harsh climate of the Andean mountain region and the mutualism thus demanded for the survival of the people living there.\n\nMembers of a community help other members for private purposes when support is needed for activities such as construction and planting. Participants are supplied with food and drink by the hosting party. The party that was helped returns the favor by assisting those who helped them or others in need of aid, completing the reciprocity.\n\nThis is not to be confused with Mink'a, also native to the Andean region, in which participants are typically paid for services such as harvesting crop.\n\nThere are many concepts globally that show similarly to ayni. While none of them are exactly the same as ayni, they all show mutualism to a certain extent.\n"}

In English, the word \"Bohemian\" was used to denote the Czech people as well as the Czech language before the word \"Czech\" became prevalent in the early 20th century.\n\nIn a separate meaning, \"Bohemian\" may also denote \"a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts\" according to Oxford Dictionaries Online. (See Bohemianism).\n\nThe name \"Bohemia\" derives from the name of the Boii, a Celtic tribe who inhabited that area towards the latter La Tène period. The toponym \"Boiohaemum,\" first attested by Tacitus, is commonly taken to mean \"home of the Boii\" (from the Germanic root *\"haima-\" meaning \"world, home\"). \n\nThe word \"Bohemian\" has never been widely used by the local Czech population. In Czech, the region since the early Middle Ages has been called \"Čechy\" but also, especially during the period of restoration/emancipation of the Czech language and nation, as \"Čechie.\" Another term, stressing the importance of the state/nation, is \"Království české\" (\"Czech Kingdom\") in Czech, or \"Böhmen\" (Königreich) in German. Its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants were called \"Čechové\" (in modern Czech \"Češi\").\n\nIn most other Western European vernaculars and in Latin (as \"Bohemi\"), the word \"Bohemian\" or a derivate was used. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations such as \"Bohemian of Bohemian language\" (\"Čech českého jazyka\"), \"a real Bohemian\" (\"pravý Čech\"), etc. were used.\n\nIt was not until the 19th century that other European languages began to use words related to \"Czechs\" (as in English, \"Tschechien\" in German, \"Tchèques\" in French) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between ethnic Slavic-speaking Bohemians and other inhabitants of Bohemia. The latter were mostly ethnic Germans, who identified as \"German Bohemians\" (\"Deutschböhmen\") or simply as \"Bohemians\" (\"Böhmen\"). In many parts of Europe, state citizenship was not identical with ethnicity and language, and the various peoples were usually identified by their language. Ethnic boundaries in Bohemia were not always sharp, and people very often were bilingual. Intermarriages across language borders were also common. Native Czech speakers often spoke German and many native German speakers spoke Czech with varying fluency, particularly in areas with many Czech speakers.\n\nCurrently, the word \"Bohemians\" is sometimes used when speaking about persons from Bohemia of all ethnic origins, especially before the year 1918, when the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist. It is also used to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part (Bohemia proper) of the state, and the eastern (Moravia) or north-eastern (Silesia) parts.\n\nThe different term \"Bohemianism\" was associated with \"a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts\", that comes from the French word \"bohémien.\"\n\n\n"}

As such, the council allows the private broadcasting industry to be self-regulating; it acts as an intermediary in the regulatory process, which is governed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The CRTC itself generally hears complaints against only the few CBSC non-members (most notably public broadcasters such as the CBC), as well as reviews of CBSC decisions; the latter rarely lead to any additional action.\n\nAlthough first suggested by private broadcasters as early as 1968, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council was not created until 1990.\n\nThe council has five primary objectives:\n\n\nCitations have been issued not only for violations of the content guidelines themselves but also for failing to provide sufficient information to viewers, i.e. missing or inadequate viewer advisories, or missing ratings icons.\n\nIf after receiving an unsatisfactory response from a broadcaster about concerns involving content broadcast by one the members of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, members of the public may file a complaint with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. The process takes some time after the complaint is raised. There is no dialogue within their process as it is purely an administrative review based on the council's own Broadcast Standards and past decisions. The exercise does not examine or re-examine the appropriateness of the current standards by the panel so community standards are not addressed. One of the many criticisms of the process is that it does not meet with stated objectives of the council as it fails to inform broadcasters of emerging and changing societal trends or develop ways to adjust broadcast standards to meet them. A written decision is supplied to the complainant citing past decisions.\n\nIn January 2011, the council's Atlantic Regional Panel ruled against CHOZ-FM in a complaint regarding the song \"Money for Nothing\" by Dire Straits (CBSC Decision 09/10-0818). The council ruled that Canadian radio stations must mute or otherwise edit out the word \"faggot\" before airing the original version of the song. The CRTC has asked the council to review their ban after they received numerous complaints about the ban. On August 31, the CBSC reiterated that it found the slur to be inappropriate; however, because of considerations in regard to its use in context, the CBSC has left it up to the stations to decide whether to play the original or edited versions of the song. Most of the CBSC panelists thought the slur was inappropriate, but it was used only in a satirical, non-hateful manner.\n\nIn 2016-10-19, CBSC's French language panel ruled video clips showing dildos and macaroni and cheese being stirred in a pot and making 'squishy' noise from MusiquePlus program CTRL broadcast on 2015-11-11 were not considered as sufficiently explicit to be classified as 'explicit sexual content'. The original complaint claimed the CTRL episode exposed complainer's children to sexual material because MusiquePlus failed to provide viewer advisories, and the cable provider rated the material as 8+. The council ruled the macaroni video failed to meet the explicit sexual content standard, and the use of f-word in the dildo video did not have the vulgar connotation it can have in English, which allowed the word to be used if it was used only on occasion and was not used to insult or attack an individual or group. However, the council determined MusiquePlus didn't post a viewer advisory warning of explicit language and sexual content during the episode in question. But MusiquePlus has since established the proper advisories, according to the council. The council also found the episode should be rated 13+, but the 8+ rating was erroneously issued by the cable company, not MusiquePlus.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1421127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1421127", "title": "Damara people", "text": "Damara people\n\nThe Damara, plural Damaran (Khoekhoegowab: ǂNūkhoen, \"Black people\", , referring to their extended stay in hilly and mountainous sites, also called at various times the Daman or the Damaqua) are an ethnic group who make up 8.5% of Namibia's population. They speak the Khoekhoe language (like the Nama people) and the majority live in the northwestern regions of Namibia, however they are also found widely across the rest of the country. They have no known cultural relationship with any of the other ethnicities anywhere else in Africa, and very little is known of their origin. It has been proposed that the Damara are a remnant population of South-Western Africa hunter-gatherers, otherwise only represented by the Cimba, Kwisi, and Kwadi, who adopted the Khoekhoe language of the immigrant Nama people. However, recent genetic studies have found that Damara are closely related to neighbouring Himba and Herero people, consistent with an origin from Bantu speakers who shifted to a different language and culture.\n\nTheir name in their own language is the \"Daman\" (where the \"-n\" is just the Khoekhoe plural ending). The name \"Damaqua\" stems from the addition of the Khoekhoe suffix \"-qua/khwa\" meaning \"people\" (found in the names of other Southern African peoples like the Namaqua and the Griqua).\n\nPrior to 1870 the hunter-gatherer Damaran occupied most of central Namibia they used to practice pastoralism with sheep and cattle, but were also agriculturalist planting pumpkins, corn, tobacco. The Damaran were also copper-smiths known for their ability to melt copper and used to make ornaments, jewellery, knives and spear heads out of iron. The Damaran just like the Sān believed in communal ownership of land meaning that no individual owned land as God had given land to everyone. Thus, rather than one person owning good grazing land and another seeking out an existence, all would live in harmony. It was for this reason that many were displaced when the Nama and Herero began to occupy this area in search of better grazing. Thereafter the Damara were dominated by the Namaqua and the Herero, most living as servants in their households.\n\nIn 1960, the South African government forced the Damara into the bantustan of Damaraland, an area of poor soil and irregular rainfall. About half of their numbers still occupy Damaraland.\n\nThe supreme deity of the Damaran (ǂNūkhoen) is ǁGamab, also referred to as \"ǁGammāb\" (provider of water), \"ǁGauna\" (Sān), \"ǁGaunab\" (Khoekhoe) and Haukhoin () by the Khoekhoe.\n\nHe lives in a high heaven, even above the heaven of the stars. ǁGamab, from ǁGam, , and mā, is provider of the water and thus associated with the rising clouds, thunder, lightning and water. He ensured the annual renewal of nature being the cycle of the seasons and supplied game animals to the ǃgarob () and the Damaran. One of his chief responsibilities is to warrant the growth of crops.\n\nǁGamab is also the God of Death, directing the fate of mankind. He shoots arrows at humans from his place above the skies and those struck fall ill and die. After death, the souls of the dead make their way to ǁGamab's village in the heaven above stars and gather around him at a ritual fire. Then he offers them a drink from a bowl of liquid fat to drink, as a reward.\n\nǁGamab's arch-enemy is the evil ǁGaunab.\n\nSince time immemorial, before the Nama migration from Southern Africa into what is today known as Namibia, and even before the arrival of the Bantu groups from North and Eastern Africa to the present-day Namibia the Damaran were living in this south-western part of Africa.\n\nAccording to written accounts of the history of the Damaran which dates back to the leadership of the Damaras as far back as the 14th century (1390), substantiated by archaeological and ethnological evidence reflected to those records, the Damaran next to the Sān, are the first inhabitants of what is today known as Namibia. Oral tradition has it that the Damaran came to Namibia from ǁKhaus (Equatorial Rainforest) through ǃĀǂkhib centuries ago.\n\nThe Damaran initially settled between Huriǂnaub (Kunene River) and ǃGûǁōb (Kavango River), before entering what later-on centuries long after became known as ǀNaweǃhūb (Ovamboland). The Damaran moved southwards and were living peacefully as a single group in the area that is a stone's throw and an eagle's flight in the surrounding of Dâureb (Brandberg Mountain), Paresis Mountains, ǃHōb (Waterberg), the Omatako Mountains, Otavi Mountains and ǃOeǂgâb (Erongo Mountains). Oral and written historical records have it that intruders, reportedly under the leadership of a certain Mukumbi (Mûtsixubi) invaded that area in 1600, and clashed with the Damaran.\n\nThe Damaran dispersed in splinter groups as a result of the aftermath of this battle wherein the then Damara Gaob (King), Gaob ǀNarimab succumbed due to injuries sustained in the battle. The Damara, besides the ǀGowanîn, splinter groups then settled all over the country in areas where there was an abundant water and shelter in the form of mountains.\n\nRemnants of the group that was led by Gaob ǀNarimab who dispersed moved eastwards and settled in the ǀGowas, also known as ǀŪmâs (Kalahari Desert) and got the name ǀGowanîn (Damaran of the Kalahari- later referred to as the Sand Kaffers by the imperialist Germans). Another group fled to mountainous central Namibia seeking shelter in ǀKhomas (Khomas Hochland), ǃAoǁaexas Mountains, ǂĒros (Eros Mountains) and ǀAu-ās (Auas Mountains) and became known as the ǀKhomanin (Damaran of the [ǀKhomas] mountains), later referred to as the Berg Damara.\n\nThe group that remained in and around ǃOeǂgâb (Erongo Mountains) and settled nearby present-day ǀÂǂgommes (Okombahe) got to be known as the ǃOeǂgân (Damaran of the Erongo Mountain).\n\nThere were also two other groups that moved down the Tsoaxub (Swakop River) and ǃKhuiseb (Kuiseb River) respectively, namely the Tsoaxudaman and the ǃKhuisedaman.\n\nAnother group, the |Gaiodaman, moved towards the area of ǃKhuidiǁgams (Omaruru) and Parase!homgu (Paresis Mountains), and later-on moved back to area west of ǃHob (Waterberg). During the 1904 wars with the German colonial forces, some members of the ǀGaiodaman fled with the Ovaherero to Piriǃhūb (Botswana), whereas some settled at ǀŪgowas in the vicinity of ǃHob (Waterberg Mountain).\n\nThe major group of Damaras fled down towards the south, as far as the ǃGarib (Orange River) and settled in that area, and installed Gaob !Gariseb as their leader. This group moved back northwards around 1670, and settled at ǂKhanubes, wherefrom they moved and split into two groups, one of which settled in the vicinity of ǂAixorobes (Tsumeb) and the other one led by Gaob ǀNarirab settled at |Haigomab!gaus, south-east of Otjituuo. The latter-mentioned group split up in four (4) factions:\n\n\nThe remainder of clans not mentioned above came into existence as a result of fractions in they already mentioned clans.\n\n\nThe Damara consist of 34 clans:\n\nAt least 12 Damara clans were recorded by the beginning of 1800 with various identities and leadership styles.\n\n\nA separate group was created in the 1970s when Damara people living at Riemvasmaak in South Africa were expelled to Khorixas in the Damara bantustan in order to make space for a military installation. This group became known as the Riemvasmakers. They were given land by Damara King Justus ǁGaroëb to settle on. When in 1994 with the independence of South Africa a process of land restitution allowed the return of families and communities, some of the Riemvasmakers returned but a residual group founded their own traditional authority. They are recognition from the Namibian government to be recognised as a separate Damara clan.\n\nThe Damara are divided into clans, each headed by a chief, with a King, Justus ǁGaroëb, over the whole Damara people. Prince ǀHaihāb, Chief Xamseb, and ǁGuruseb were among the richest and most powerful chiefs.\n\nDamara males were not circumcised. However, groups of boys were initiated into manhood through an elaborate hunting ritual. This ritual is repeated twice, for teenagers and grown men, after which the initiates are considered clan elders.\n\nTheir traditional clothing colors are green, white, and blue. Green and blue identify the different sub-groups. Some women may wear white and blue or white and green, the white representing peace and unity among all Damara-speaking people.\n\nThe women do household chores like cooking, cleaning, and gardening. Their primary duty is milking the cows in the morning and nurturing the young. Men traditionally hunt and herd the cattle, leaving the village as early as the sunrise, patrolling their area to protect their cattle and grazing ground as tradition dictates. Men can be very aggressive towards intruders if not notified of any other male presence in a grazing area.\n\nThough many Damara people own and live on rural farms, the majority live in the small towns scattered across the Erongo region or in Namibia's capital city of Windhoek. Those that still live on farms tend to live in extended family groups of as many as one hundred, creating small villages of family members.\n\nThe Damara are rich in cattle and sheep. Some chiefs possess up to 8,000 head of horned cattle.\n\nThe Damara made use of animal hides for clothing. The principal animal hides that were used were those of springbok and goats for clothing and sheep and jackal for blankets. Damaran traditional attires differentiated between a girl, an unmarried or married woman and an elderly woman in the same manner that it differentiated between boys, unmarried and married men and men of age. Some outfits were reserved for special ceremonies in contrast to everyday garments.\n\nA girl in a Damara context is any female that has not yet undergone the menstrual cycle while a boy is any male that has not yet undergone the first hunting ritual. A hunting ritual was performed in the Damara culture as Damara males were not circumcised. The first hunting ritual was performed by boys in order to become man and the second by man to become community elders. All Damara children regardless of sex wore a \"ǃgaes\", an apron like loin-cloth that covers genitalia. Girls would at a tender age undergo the \"ǂgaeǂnoas\" (have earring holes made) after which black thread would be inserted until such a time they will first start wearing \"ǃgamdi\" (earrings).\n\nA man in the Damara context is any male that has undergone the first hunting ritual while a woman is any female that has experienced the menstrual cycle. The Damara culture would continue to differentiate between a married and unmarried man or woman. An unmarried man is called an \"axa-aob\" while a woman is an \"oaxaes\". An unmarried man would simply wear a \"ǁnaweb\" which is a loin-cloth that is tucked in between the legs while an unmarried woman wore a \"ǃgaes\" to cover genitalia and a \"ǀgâubes\" to cover the rears.\n\nA married man that has a child or children is called an \"aob\", while a married woman with children is a \"taras\". Such a man would wear a \"sorab\" which is a strip of soft leather worn between legs. Both ends are tucked under thong around waist and flapped over at front and the back. They would also wear a \"danakhōb\" which is the skin of any smallish animal that the wife presents to her husband at their wedding to wear on his head. The men would were the \"head hide\" to ceremonies and on auspicious occasions to show that he is the head of a household. The hide would preferably be of a \"ǃnoreb\" (a common genet). Married women just like girls would wear a \"ǀgâubes\" (rear loincloth) and would wear a \"ǀawiǃgaes\" (loincloth consisting of strips) instead of a regular \"ǃgaes\". A \"ǁkhaikhōb\" would also be worn only to ceremonies and on auspicious occasions, but mostly during pregnancy and by elder women on a daily basis. The ǁkhaikhōb is the hide of a medium-sized antelope most preferably a \"ǀhauib\" (a Damara dik-dik) or a \"dôas\", \"ǀnâus\" (Duiker) that is worn to cover breast and the abdomen (during pregnancy).\n\nAn elderly man, \"kaikhoeb\", is any Damara male that has undergone the second and last hunting ritual. An elderly woman, a \"kaikhoes\", is a female that has concluded her menstrual cycle. All elderly men and women would wear a \"ǃgūb\", which is a skirt-like loin-cloth or traditional skirt for men and women. Elderly women would also wear a \"ǁkhaikhōb\" and sometimes a \"khōǃkhaib\" (headgear fashioned of soft hide).\n\nWomen being more aware of beautification would wear \"ǃgamdi\" (small traditional earrings made from iron and or copper) and wear necklaces made of ostrich egg shells known as a ǁnûib in Khoekhoegowab. Women wore ǃganudi (arm bangles) and ǃgoroǃkhuidi (ornamental anklets) they also originally made from iron and or copper later replaced by beads and or ostrich egg shells. An anklet made from moth larvae (ǀkhîs) was also worn but only during performances/dances along with a tussled apron known as a ǀhapis (for females) and or ǀhapib (for males)\n\nǃNau-i (traditional facial foundation) also played a significant part in Damara and the wider Khoekhoe cosmetics. Women would ǀīǃnâ (perfume) hides and blankets by stewing buchu on hot stones placed under a ǀīǃnâs (dome-shaped basket) after which they would boro themselves (smear red ochre on their faces) early in the morning. They would also sprinkle some sâ-i (buchu powder) on their hides and blankets with a ǃūro-ams (powder-puff made from a piece of hare fur used to pluck ǃūros (tortoise-shell container, carried by women for holding sâ-i) to power oneself.)\n\nMan also wore arm bangles (ǃganugu) and ǃgoroǃkhuigu (anklets) which were unadorned in design and denser than those of women. A strand of beads that criss-crossed the chess known as a karab was also worn by men. Tsaob (ash) was used as an anti-perspiring agent by the Damaran as they believe that it is the purest substance on Earth.\n\nThe replacement of animal hides with fabrics has also been visible in the Damara culture as the aforementioned outfits are mostly worn to cultural ceremonies and on auspicious occasions. Thus the Damaran sought for a perfect substitution for animal hides and introduced the Damarokoes (Damara dress). The Damarokoes was adopted form missionary wives in the mid-19th century and was introduced due to the Christianisation of the Damaran as missionaries saw the animal hides as \"primitive and exposing\". The dress adopted to cover up the \"nude\" Damara women ensured just that with its ankle-lengthiness and long sleeves and a ǃkhens (shawl) to ensure maximum coverage.\n\nThe Dama ǃkhaib (headgear) is a unique innovation of the Damara women as they shaped a headgear that can be fashionable yet work effective as they still could ǂkhao (carry/load something on head) water containers and firewood. It is not only the ǃkhaib that was fashionable and work effective but also the sleeves as the sleeves have a protruding elbow design allowing the elbow to contract and release without constrains. The length of the dress is also fashionable and work effective as it is not too long so as to be caught by twigs, branches and or thorns.\n\nDamara men on the other hand were shirts, coats and or blazers with Damara colours being blue, white and green, sometimes with print or embroidery.\n"}

By the middle of the seventeenth century, days of thanksgiving were celebrated in New England annually in November.\n\nA day of humiliation or thanksgiving might be proclaimed in response to a drought, flood, fire, military defeat, or plague. They might also be held before the undertaking of a difficult endeavor. People were expected to search themselves for sin and to repent in order to appease God's wrath. Everyone between the ages of sixteen and sixty was expected to spend the entire day in fasting, church attendance, listening to sermons of exhortation and meditating on their sin. \n\nA day of thanksgiving might be held in response to signs of God's mercy, such as rain allowing a good harvest, arrival of needed supplies, or recovery from sickness. They might also be held after a long period of general success and lack of disaster. On days of thanksgiving, the faithful would also spend the day in church attendance, but would pray thankfully, sing psalms of praise, and feast. Puritan feast days were more solemn and demanding than traditional Christian feasts. Days of thanksgiving were celebrated with joy in thanks for recent blessing, but Puritans also saw them as days to look forward to the coming of the Kingdom of God.\n\nPuritans rejected the traditional Christian liturgical calendar of holy days, including Easter and Christmas, as well as saints' days, but set aside special days in response to current events. However, natural cycles caused penance and rebirth to continue to be associated with Spring, as had been the case with Easter. Thanksgiving days were normally celebrated in Autumn following the harvest.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9505", "title": "Elias Canetti", "text": "Elias Canetti\n\nElias Canetti (; ; 25 July 1905 – 14 August 1994) was a German-language author, born in Ruse, Bulgaria to a merchant family. They moved to Manchester, England, but his father died in 1912, and his mother took her three sons back to the continent. They settled in Vienna. \n\nCanetti moved to England in 1938 after the Anschluss to escape Nazi persecution. He became a British citizen in 1952. He is known as a modernist novelist, playwright, memoirist, and non-fiction writer. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981, \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". He is noted for his non-fiction book \"Crowds and Power\", among other works.\n\nBorn in 1905 to businessman Jacques Canetti and Mathilde \"née\" Arditti in Ruse, a city on the Danube in Bulgaria, Canetti was the eldest of three sons. His ancestors were Sephardi Jews. His paternal ancestors settled in Ruse from Ottoman Adrianople. The original family name was \"Cañete\", named after Cañete, Cuenca, a village in Spain.\n\nIn Ruse, Canetti's father and grandfather were successful merchants who operated out of a commercial building, which they had built in 1898. Canetti's mother descended from the Arditti family, one of the oldest Sephardi families in Bulgaria, who were among the founders of the Ruse Jewish colony in the late 18th century. The Ardittis can be traced to the 14th century, when they were court physicians and astronomers to the Aragonese royal court of Alfonso IV and Pedro IV. Before settling in Ruse, they had migrated into Italy and lived in Livorno in the 17th century.\nCanetti spent his childhood years, from 1905 to 1911, in Ruse until the family moved to Manchester, England, where Canetti's father joined a business established by his wife's brothers. In 1912, his father died suddenly, and his mother moved with their children first to Lausanne, then Vienna in the same year. They lived in Vienna from the time Canetti was aged seven onwards. His mother insisted that he speak German, and taught it to him. By this time Canetti already spoke Ladino (his native language), Bulgarian, English, and some French; the latter two he studied in the one year they were in Britain. Subsequently the family moved first (from 1916 to 1921) to Zürich and then (until 1924) to Frankfurt, where Canetti graduated from high school.\n\nCanetti went back to Vienna in 1924 in order to study chemistry. However, his primary interests during his years in Vienna became philosophy and literature. Introduced into the literary circles of First-Republic-Vienna, he started writing. Politically leaning towards the left, he was present at the July Revolt of 1927 – he came near to the action accidentally, was most impressed by the burning of books (recalled frequently in his writings), and left the place quickly with his bicycle. He gained a degree in chemistry from the University of Vienna in 1929, but never worked as a chemist.\n\nHe published two works in Vienna before escaping to Great Britain. He reflected the experiences of Nazi Germany and political chaos in his works, especially exploring mob action and group thinking in his novel \"Die Blendung\" (\"Auto-da-Fé\", 1935) and non-fiction \"Crowds and Power\" (1960). He wrote several volumes of memoirs, contemplating the influence of his multi-lingual background and childhood.\nIn 1934 in Vienna he married Veza (Venetiana) Taubner-Calderon (1897–1963), who acted as his muse and devoted literary assistant. Canetti remained open to relationships with other women. In 1938, after the \"Anschluss\" with Germany, the Canetti couple moved to London. He became closely involved with the painter Marie-Louise von Motesiczky, who was to remain a close companion for many years. His name has also been linked with the author Iris Murdoch (see John Bayley's \"Iris, A Memoir of Iris Murdoch\", which has several references to an author, referred to as \"the Dichter\", who was a Nobel Laureate and whose works included \"Die Blendung\" [English title \"Auto-da-Fé\"]). \n\nAfter Veza died in 1963, Canetti married Hera Buschor (1933–1988), with whom he had a daughter, Johanna, in 1972. Canetti's brother Jacques Canetti settled in Paris, where he championed a revival of French chanson. Despite being a German-language writer, Canetti settled in Britain until the 1970s, receiving British citizenship in 1952. For his last 20 years, Canetti lived mostly in Zürich.\n\nA writer in German, Canetti won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981, \"for writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power\". He is known chiefly for his celebrated trilogy of autobiographical memoirs of his childhood and of pre-Anschluss Vienna: \"Die Gerettete Zunge\" (The Tongue Set Free); \"Die Fackel im Ohr\" (The Torch in My Ear), and \"Das Augenspiel\" (The Play of the Eyes); for his modernist novel \"Auto-da-Fé\" (\"Die Blendung\"); and for \"Crowds and Power\", a psychological study of crowd behaviour as it manifests itself in human activities ranging from mob violence to religious congregations. \n\nIn the 1970s, Canetti began to travel more frequently to Zurich, where he settled and lived for his last 20 years. He died in Zürich in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

SIL Ethnologue reports more than 130 distinct languages spoken in Chad.\n\nThe 14 million Chad people belong to some 200 ethnicities, who speak numerous languages. The southern part of the country was historically the cross roads of the caravan routes below the Sahara, forming a link between West Africa and the Arabic region, as well as one between North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa. The slave trade between sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East passed through the slave markets of Chad and Western Sudan, slave-trading was a key component of Chad's historic economy, and this brought people of various ethnicities into Chad. The CIA Factbook estimates the largest ethnic groups in 2009 as:\n\nThe peoples of Chad carry significant ancestry from Eastern, Central, Western, and Northern Africa.\n\n\nThe population can be broadly divided between those in the east, north and west who follow Islam, and the peoples of the south, by which is meant the five southernmost prefectures, who are mostly Christian or animist.\n\nIslamization began as early as the 8th century and was mostly complete by the 11th, when Islam became the official religion of the Kanem-Bornu Empire. The Arab invaders established an economy of slave trade across the Sudan region, and in Chad there was a tradition of slave raids (ghazw) under the Ouaddai and Baguirmi which persisted well into the 20th century.\n\nThe Arabs of Chad form a relatively homogeneous group, localized in the regions of Chari Baguirmi and Ouaddai, but mostly seminomadic. \nOther Muslim groups include the Toubou, Hadjerai, Fulbe/Fulani, Kotoko, Kanembou, Baguirmi, Boulala, Zaghawa, and Maba. \nSome indigenous groups, such as the Salamat and the Taundjor, were largely Arabized by intermarriage over the years.\n\nAmong the non-Muslim indigenous peoples, the most important (and the largest single group in Chad) are the Sara, about 30 percent of the population. They live in the valleys of the Chari and Logone rivers and are farmers of considerable skill. Others include the Ngambaye, Mbaye, Goulaye, Moundang, Moussei, and Massa. \n\nEthno-linguistically, the groups may be divided into:\n"}
{"id": "936945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=936945", "title": "Fante people", "text": "Fante people\n\nThe Mfantsefo or Fante (\"Fanti\" is an older spelling) are an Akan people. The Fante subgroup is mainly gathered in the central coastal region of Ghana, with some also in Ivory Coast. Originally, \"Fante\" referred to tiny states within a radius of Mankessim. The states that made up the Fante were Kurantsi, Abura, Anyan, Ekumfi, Nkusukum, Ajumako and Gomoa.\n\nThe main Fante city is Cape Coast, Central region, and Mankessim is the traditional headquarters. The Fante people are one of the Akan group, along with the \"Asantefo\" or Ashantis, the Akuapem, the Akyem, the Baoule, Nzema, and others. Despite the rapid growth of the Ashanti Empire in historic times, the Fante have always retained their state to this day. Currently, they number about 3.5 million, the third largest grouping of Akan peoples. Inheritance and succession to public office among the Fante are traditionally determined by matrilineal descent, as is common among Akan peoples.\n\nWhen the Portuguese arrived in the 15th century, the Fante prevented them from venturing inland and leased properties for Portuguese trading missions. But when the Portuguese objected to Fante rules and regulations, the Fante expelled them. Thereafter the Dutch arrived, followed by the British. The Fante served as middlemen in the commerce between the interior and British and Dutch traders on the coast.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Fante Confederacy was formed, with the aim of establishing themselves as a nation to be taken seriously by their European counterparts. So in 1844 a bond was written between the Fante, on behalf of the Gold Coast, and the British, allowing the Gold Coast to gain independence without war one hundred years later. Several Ashanti-Fante wars followed. On one occasion, the Fante were aided by the British, who, however, destroyed the strong Fante confederation established between 1868 and 1872, believing it a threat to their hegemony on the coast.\n\nThe Fante have produced numerous illustrious and prominent people, notable among whom are Kofi Annan (former UN Secretary General), Jacob Wilson Sey (first indigenous multimillionaire on the Gold Coast), British journalist and writer Ekow Eshun, Ottobah Cugoano (abolitionist and natural rights philosopher), Sam Jonah (ex-CEO of AngloGold Ashanti), John Atta Mills (Ghana's late former president), and a number of the advocates of independence, not only in Ghana but also in the West African sub-region, such as John Mensah Sarbah, James Kwegyir Aggrey and J. E. Casely Hayford.\n\nOne of the social contexts of names among the Akan, including the Fante, is that they are used as social tags to indicate personal and group identity. This is so with family names derived from the patrilineal clans of the fathers that are given to children. Each of the 12 patrilineal clans has its peculiar family names. It is thus possible to use one’s name to trace his/her patrilineal clan. Children who trace their genealogy to one patrilineal father may therefore share similar family names. Typical family names include Yankah, Osam, Aidoo, etc. There have also been innovations as a result of westernisation, education and foreign religion. Multiple names have also developed out of this phenomenon. Also, some Fante names are translated literally into English and such anglicised names have come to stay as family names. One can argue that the Fantes living on the coast were the first to be in contact with the Europeans. It is therefore possible that the trend is a western influence. Examples of such anglicised transformational name are:\n\nAccordingly, some family names can also be identified by the suffix, for example:\nOtherwise, Fante (Akan) typological family names indicate various contexts. They may be circumstantial, manner of birth, theophorous, weird names, insinuating and proverbial names, gang and nicknames, status, occupational, professional, religious, matrimonial, and western names. There can be a combination of two or more of these typological names.\n\n"}
{"id": "23942007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23942007", "title": "Feminist views on pornography", "text": "Feminist views on pornography\n\nFeminist views on pornography range from condemnation of all of it as a form of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms as a medium of feminist expression. This debate reflects larger concerns surrounding feminist views on sexuality, and is closely related to those on prostitution, on BDSM, and other issues. Pornography has been one of the most divisive issues in feminism, particularly in anglophone countries. This deep division was exemplified in the feminist sex wars of the 1980s, which pitted anti-pornography activists against sex-positive ones.\n\nFeminist opponents of pornography—such as Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon, Robin Morgan, Diana Russell, Alice Schwarzer, Gail Dines, and Robert Jensen—argue that pornography is harmful to women, and constitutes strong causality or facilitation of violence against women.\n\nCatharine McKinnon and Andrea Dworkin had separately staked out a position that pornography was inherently exploitative toward women, and they called for a civil law to make pornographers accountable for harms that could be shown to result from the use, production, and circulation of their publications. When Dworkin testified before the Meese Commission in 1986, she said that 65 to 75 percent of women in prostitution and hard-core pornography had been victims of incest or child sexual abuse.\n\nAndrea Dworkin's activism against pornography during the 1980s brought her to national attention.\n\nAnti-pornography feminists, notably Catharine MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic coercion of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves. It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. Gail Dines holds that pornography, exemplified by gonzo pornography, is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.\n\nAnti-pornography feminists point to the testimony of well known participants in pornography, such as Traci Lords and Linda Boreman, and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography, either by somebody else, or by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of \"Ordeal\", in which Linda Boreman (who under the name of \"Linda Lovelace\" had starred in \"Deep Throat\") stated that she had been beaten, raped, and pimped by her husband Chuck Traynor, and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in \"Deep Throat\", as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence, to make other pornographic films. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches.\n\nOn-face ejaculation and anal sex are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn. MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as \"the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words\".\n\nThe effects produced by those who view pornography are mixed and still widely debated. Generally, research has been focused around the effects of voluntary viewing of pornography. There have also been studies analyzing the inadvertent exposure to explicit sexual content, including: viewing naked photographs of people, people engaging in sexual acts, accidental web searches, or opening online links to pornographic material. It has been found that most exposure to pornography online is unsolicited and by accident. 42% of those who view online pornography are ages ranging between 10 and 17; 66% have experienced inadvertent exposure.\n\nJae Woong Shim of Sookmyung Women's University along with Bryant M. Paul of Indiana University published a controlled study looking at such inadvertent exposure to pornography in regards to the feeling of anonymity titled \"The Role of Anonymity in the Effects of Inadvertent Exposure to Online Pornography Among Young Adult Males.\" The study consisted of 84 male students, ages 18 and older, volunteering from a large American university in the Midwest. After completing an arbitrary survey, they were shown a 10-second pop-up clip consisting either of sexual or nonsexual content. Half of the subjects exposed to either clip believed they were viewing the content nonanonymously. The other half believed they were anonymous, and they were not being monitored. They were then asked if they would rather view hardcore pornography, softcore pornography, or nonsexual material. The hardcore pornography depicted women as sexual objects, and male-superiority. The softcore pornography was less graphic. The nonsexual material was a video of a professor's lecture unrelated to sexual content.\n\nAfter being exposed to the inadvertent pop-up clip, researchers noted which of the three above content choices the subjects selected. Researchers then measured the participants’ sexist attitudes towards women using a questionnaire asking the agreeability of statements to women gaining more control over men. The higher the score, the higher the subjects are thought to hold sexist views. Those who believed they were anonymous were less likely to be conscious of their monitoring compared to the nonanonymous group. It turns out, those who were exposed to sexual content and believed they were anonymous, were the most likely to choose the hardcore pornography that depicts the most objectification of women. The next highest choice for the hardcore pornography was the group exposed to nonsexual material, yet believed to be anonymous. These two groups were the most likely to hold hostile sexist attitudes towards women after the 10 second inadvertent exposure to sexual content compared to before the study.\n\nThis indicates negative opinions towards women. It is concluded that being exposed to sexual content, even when it is unwanted, leads men to develop harsher sexist attitudes towards women. The greater intrigue for men to view hardcore and unusual pornography was greater when they believed to be doing so anonymously. This is most likely tied to the theory of deindividuation. The theory states that a person detaches his or her self from personal responsibility and awareness as an individual, and is more likely to act differently than when their behaviors are socially attached to his or her character. \"When individuals perceive that no one knows what they are viewing, they are likely to experience reduced self-awareness, which, in turn, leads to being less considerate toward others\". This implies that these men would be less likely to view the pornography which harshly objectifies women if they know others would be aware if they do so, due to the perceived social consequences.\n\nSince the feeling of anonymity disregard social norms, there is a higher chance of pursuing more extreme stimuli. This study does not prove that the men willing to watch the hardcore pornography and hold more sexist views are more likely to act out these desires and beliefs toward women. Valerie Webber in her article \"Shades of Gay: Performance of Girl-on-Girl Pornography and mobile authenticities\" differentiates the sex depicted in porn and personal, private sexual encounters. At first, she argues that performing sex produces normative ideas about what makes sex authentic. These normative beliefs then transfer into personal experiences where people feel an obligation to perform sex as they have viewed it in pornography.\n\nWebber discovered that there is no true authenticity surrounding sex. Sex through the lens of pornography is still legitimate, yet most performers exaggerate the act to make it more rousing and intimate to the audience. She explains that \"performance…does not preclude authenticity. Performance is the means by which ‘authenticity’ is established as a category\". Yet the women interviewed had wide beliefs about what made sex authentic, most of which included a sense of intimacy. One interviewee pointed out that pornography is stigmatized for not being genuine, which is not true for all performers. Some are completely satisfied with the sex performed for porn, while others report low satisfaction. Those who perform in pornography have different intentions for doing so, much like any other job. Some performers do it because they like pleasing their audience, some do it for personal pleasure, and some feel they are creating something of artistic value. As Webber puts it, \"if fake equals ‘bad’, then good must equal ‘real’. The motives can be ‘pure’, but what those motives are can differ dramatically\". Performers are usually aware of what their audience expects from them and what viewers enjoy. Webber could theorize that women use this knowledge and personal intentions to produce pornography in which men anonymously consume, which then authenticates the normality of such depictions of sex as being appropriate and desirable.\n\nAnti-pornography feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of rape and other forms of violence against women. Robin Morgan summarizes this idea with her often-quoted statement, \"Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice.\"\n\nAnti-pornography feminists charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment. MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering rape myths. Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no. Additionally, according to MacKinnon, pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women, and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused, an effect she claims is well documented.\n\nRape of a prepubescent child followed \"habitual\" consumption of child porn \"within six months\" although the men were previously \"horrified at the idea\", according to Gail Dines, that interviewed men in prison.\n\nGerman radical feminist Alice Schwarzer is one proponent of this point of view, in particular in the feminist magazine \"Emma\". Many opponents of pornography believe that pornography gives a distorted view of men and women's bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing the performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure, as well as fetishes that are not the norm, such as watersports, being presented as popular and normal.\n\nHarry Brod offered a Marxist feminist view, \"I [Brod] would argue that sex seems overrated [to men] because men look to sex for fulfillment of nonsexual emotional needs, a quest doomed to failure. Part of the reason for this failure is the priority of quantity over quality of sex which comes with sexuality's commodification.\"\n\nGail Dines said, \"'[p]ornography is the perfect propaganda piece for patriarchy. In nothing else is their hatred of us quite as clear.'\"\n\nFrom the mid 1970s into the early 1980s, public rallies and marches protesting pornography and prostitution drew widespread support among women and men from across the political spectrum. Beginning in the late 1970s, anti-pornography radical feminists formed organizations such as Women Against Pornography, Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media, Women Against Violence Against Women, Feminists Fighting Pornography, and like groups that provided educational events, including slide-shows, speeches, guided tours of the sex shops in areas like New York's Times Square and San Francisco's Tenderloin District, petitioning, and publishing newsletters, in order to raise awareness of the content of pornography and the sexual subculture in pornography shops and live sex shows.\n\nSimilar groups also emerged in the United Kingdom, including legislatively focused groups such as Campaign Against Pornography and Campaign Against Pornography and Censorship, as well as groups associated with radical feminism such as Women Against Violence Against Women and its direct action offshoot Angry Women.\n\nMany anti-pornography feminists—Dworkin and MacKinnon in particular—advocated laws which defined pornography as a civil rights harm and allowed women to sue pornographers in civil court. The Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance that they drafted was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council in 1983, but vetoed by Mayor Donald Fraser, on the grounds that the city could not afford the litigation over the law's constitutionality.\n\nThe ordinance was successfully passed in 1984 by the Indianapolis city council and signed by Mayor William Hudnut, and passed by a ballot initiative in Bellingham, Washington in 1988, but struck down both times as unconstitutional by the state and federal courts. In 1986, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' rulings in the Indianapolis case without comment.\n\nMany anti-pornography feminists supported the legislative efforts, but others objected that legislative campaigns would be rendered ineffectual by the courts, would violate principles of free speech, or would harm the anti-pornography movement by taking organizing energy away from education and direct action and entangling it in political squabbles.\n\nDworkin and MacKinnon responded to the alleged violation of free speech principles by pointing out that the Ordinance was designed with an explicit goal of preventing its misinterpretation and abuse for the purpose of censorship or discrimination against sexual minorities. Their publication \"Pornography and Civil Rights\" serves as a manifesto backing the law, providing an extensive self-analysis and explanation of its intended meaning, and declaring the exact circumstances under which the law would apply.\n\nAnother feminist approach was designed to permit survivors of crime when the crime was the result of pornographic influence to sue the pornographers. The Pornography Victims' Compensation Act of 1991 (previously known as the Pornography Victims Protection Act) was supported by groups including Feminists Fighting Pornography. Catharine MacKinnon declined to support the legislation, though aspects of it were based on her legal approach to pornography. The bill was introduced in Congress, thus, had it passed, it would have applied nationwide.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada's 1992 ruling in \"R. v. Butler\" (the Butler decision) fueled further controversy, when the court decided to incorporate some elements of Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In \"Butler\" the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law \"could\" be enforced constitutionally against some pornography on the basis of the Charter's guarantees of sex equality.\n\nThe Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with MacKinnon's support and participation. Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, arguing that feminists should not support or attempt to reform criminal obscenity law.\n\n\"Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards\" was a sexual harassment Federal district court case. It recognized as law that pornography could illegally contribute to sexual harassment through a workplace environment hostile to women. The court's order included a ban on \"displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, promotional materials, reading materials, or other materials that are sexually suggestive, sexually demeaning, or pornographic, or bringing into the JSI [the employer's] work environment or possessing any such material to read, display or view at work.\" \"A picture will be presumed to be sexually suggestive if it depicts a person of either sex who is not fully clothed or in clothes that are not suited to or ordinarily accepted for the accomplishment of routine work in and around the shipyard and who is posed for the obvious purpose of displaying or drawing attention to private portions of his or her body.\" It is not clear whether the decision was directly attributable to the anti-pornography feminist analysis, if the influence was indirect, or if the outcome was coincidental, but counsel Legal Momentum was historically associated with the National Organization for Women (NOW), a leading feminist organization, suggesting that counsel was likely to have had knowledge of the feminist theory.\n\nIn this view, pornography is seen as being a medium for women's sexual expression. Sex-positive feminists view many radical feminist views on sexuality, including views on pornography, as being equally oppressive as those of patriarchal religions and ideologies, and argue that anti-pornography feminist discourse ignores and trivializes women's sexual agency. Ellen Willis (who coined the term \"pro-sex feminism\") states \"As we saw it, the claim that 'pornography is violence against women' was code for the neo-Victorian idea that men want sex and women endure it.\"\n\nSex-positive feminists take a variety of views towards existing pornography. Many of these feminists see pornography as subverting many traditional ideas about women that they oppose, such as ideas that women do not like sex generally, only enjoy sex in a relational context, or that women only enjoy vanilla sex. They also argue that pornography sometimes shows women in sexually dominant roles and presents women with a greater variety of body types than are typical of mainstream entertainment and fashion, and that women's participation in these roles allows for a fulfillment of their sexual identity and free expression.\n\nMany feminists regardless of their views on pornography are opposed on principle to censorship. Even the feminists who see pornography as a sexist institution, also see censorship (including MacKinnon's civil law approach) as an evil. In its mission statement, Feminists for Free Expression argues that censorship has never reduced violence, but historically been used to silence women and stifle efforts for social change. They point to the birth control literature of Margaret Sanger, the feminist plays of Holly Hughes, and works like \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" and \"The Well of Loneliness\" as examples of feminist sexual speech which has been the target of censorship. FFE further argues that the attempt to fix social problems through censorship, \"divert[s] attention from the substantive causes of social ills and offer a cosmetic, dangerous 'quick fix.'\" They argue that instead a free and vigorous marketplace of ideas is the best assurance for achieving feminist goals in a democratic society.\n\nCritics of anti-pornography feminism accuse their counterparts of selective handling of social scientific evidence. Anti-pornography feminists are also critiqued as intolerant of sexual difference and is characterized as often indiscriminately supporting state censorship policy and are accused of complicity with conservative sexual politics and Christian Right groups.\n\nSeveral feminist anti-censorship groups have actively opposed anti-pornography legislation and other forms of censorship. These groups have included the Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce (FACT) and Feminists for Free Expression in the US and Feminists Against Censorship in the UK.\n\nAndrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon responded with a statement claiming that the idea that these raids reflected the application of pre-\"Butler\" standards and that it was actually illegal under \"Butler\" to selectively target LGBT materials. However, opponents of \"Butler\" have countered that the decision simply reinforced an existing politics of censorship that pre-dated the decision.\n\nAnti-censorship feminists question why only some forms of sexist communication (namely sexually arousing/explicit ones) should be banned, while not advocating bans against equally misogynist public discourse. Susie Bright notes, \"It's a far different criticism to note that porn is sexist. So are all commercial media. That's like tasting several glasses of salt water and insisting only one of them is salty. The difference with porn is that it is people fucking, and we live in a world that cannot tolerate that image in public.\"\n\nPornography produced by and with feminist women is a small, but growing segment of the porn industry.\n\nAccording to Tristan Taormino, \"Feminist porn both responds to dominant images with alternative ones and creates its own iconography.\"\n\nSome pornographic actresses such as Nina Hartley, Ovidie, Madison Young, and Sasha Grey are also self-described sex-positive feminists, and state that they do not see themselves as victims of sexism. They defend their decision to perform in pornography as freely chosen, and argue that much of what they do on camera is an expression of their sexuality. It has also been pointed out that in pornography, women generally earn more than their male counterparts.\n\nFeminist porn directors include Candida Royalle, Tristan Taormino, Madison Young, Shine Louise Houston, and Erika Lust. Some of these directors make pornography specifically for a female or genderqueer audience, while others try for a broad appeal across genders and sexual orientations.\n\nSome anti-pornography feminists, such as Gloria Steinem and Page Mellish, distinguish between \"pornography\" and \"erotica\", as different classes of sexual media, the former emphasizing dominance and the latter emphasizing mutuality. Steinem holds that, \"These two sorts of images are as different as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.\" Feminists who subscribe to this view hold that erotica promotes positive and pro-woman sexual values and does not carry the harmful effects of pornography.\n\nOther anti-pornography feminists are more skeptical about this distinction, holding that all sexual materials produced in a patriarchal system are expressions of male dominance. Andrea Dworkin wrote, \"erotica is simply high-class pornography: better produced, better conceived, better executed, better packaged, designed for a better class of consumer.\"\n\nHowever, some feminists tend not to make a distinction between pornography and erotica, and those who have addressed the distinction made by Steinem and others find it problematic. Ellen Willis holds that the term 'erotica' is needlessly vague and euphemistic, and appeals to an idealized version of what kind of sex people should want rather than what arouses the sexual feelings people actually have. She also emphasizes the subjectivity of the distinction, stating, \"In practice, attempts to sort out good erotica from bad porn inevitably comes down to 'What turns me on is erotica; what turns you on is pornographic.'\"\n\nSome feminists make an analogous distinction between mainstream pornography and feminist pornography, viewing mainstream pornography as problematic or even wholly misogynistic, while praising feminist pornography.\n\nThe work of feminist pornography includes studying women, children and men in the industry. Some feminists argue against pornography because it can be viewed as demeaning and degrading to women and men. Some argue that pornography is used by men as a guide to hate, abuse, and control women.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Annie Sprinkle, Candida Royalle, and Nina Hartley were some of the first feminist-identified performers in the porn industry.\n\nIn 2002, Becky Goldberg produced the documentary \"Hot and Bothered: Feminist Pornography,\" a look at women who direct, produce, and sell feminist porn. Feminist pornography is whenever the women is in control of the sexual situation, she is in control of what is being done to her and she enjoys it. Goldberg's views on feminism and pornography is, \"if you don't like what you see make your own\".\n\nCourtney Trouble is a feminist performer and producer of queer porn. Her films feature \"sexual and gender minorities.\" Trouble began in the business when she decided she did not see enough diversity in the business, and wanted to make a positive change.\n\nShine Louise Houston, owner of Pink and White Productions, produces porn that features reflect different types of sexuality, different genders, and queer people of color.\n\nLorraine Hewitt is the creative director of the Feminist Porn Awards based in Toronto, Canada.\n\nTristan Taormino is both a sex educator and feminist pornographer who has helped produce films, written books, owns her own website and has published many articles on topics related to sexuality, gender and articles on sex positive relationships. Taormino views porn as a positive part of life.\n\n\n"}

She is active on social networks and has over 800 friends on Facebook. She lives with three friends, Olivia (Brit Morgan), Isabelle (Brooke Markham) and Gustavo (Sean Marquette). She is also close friends with Kobe (Connor Paolo) and is dating Tyler (William Moseley).\n\nLaura receives a friend request from a student at her campus, Marina Mills. Seeing her talents in animation, she accepts the request and begins a friendship with the lonely girl. However she soon notices that Marina's Facebook profile is plastered in bizarre and disturbing images and her obsessive behavior begins to make Laura feel uncomfortable. When Laura shares pictures of herself at her birthday dinner – to which Marina was not invited – Marina publicly and angrily confronts her at her college campus. During the quarrel, Laura accidentally pushes Marina and her hood falls off, revealing her bald spot, a result of hair pulling disorder, causing Marina to run away. Laura notices Marina's several comments, who tries to apologize to her, Laura eventually unfriends Marina on Facebook. Seeing her number of friends once again down to zero, a heartbroken Marina angrily closes her laptop. That night, Laura notices a black mirror, which shows a forest where a dark figure is seen walking. As Laura is staring at it, a terrifying demonic face appears behind her, but quickly disappears when Olivia turns on the light. In the next morning, teacher reveals that Marina has committed suicide, much to Laura's astonishment.\n\nAnother night, Marina uploads a video, showing she burns the drawing of Laura and commits suicide by hanging herself, terrifying Laura.\n\nThe next morning, Laura receives a message from Marina containing the video of her suicide. Later on, it is posted to her Facebook page. Laura is unable to remove the video, and her friend count drops. Left with no choice, she tries to delete her account, but an unknown error occurs. Realizing that she is being stalked, Laura goes to Kobe's apartment for help. When Kobe and Laura investigate Marina's Facebook page, they realize that the source code where it has been written is not the normal code.\n\nThat night, Marina adds Gustavo as a friend and posts a distorted picture of his face. The lights suddenly cut off, he is then terrorized by a spirit, while seeing things that were posted on Marina's page. Gustavo rushes into the elevator for safety, only to be attacked by a swarm of wasps; as the elevator doors opens, he is seen smashing his face against the elevator walls by an unseen force, and is discovered by Isabelle, who was sent to a hospital and begins to blame Laura for Gustavo's death.\n\nThe recorded video of the elevator attack is posted on Laura's Facebook page. Her friends subsequently turn against her by posting angry and disgusted comments, effectively making her an outcast. Laura attempts to text her friends that she didn't, but to her confusion, the texts suddenly changes to \"u will know what it feels to be lonely :)\". Laura goes to the orphanage where she meets the woman, who reveals that Marina's real last name is Nedifar; Marina was ruthlessly bullied and tormented by some boys when she was seven-years old. However, they were murdered by an unknown assailant. Meanwhile, Kobe is looking for the black mirror on a website. He learns that they were used by witches. Suddenly, several faces of Marina appear on the monitors as the lights begin flickering, but everything quickly reverts when the custodian arrives.\n\nA devastated Isabelle is going through pictures on her phone, she begins hallucinating and notices the burnt body of a woman and rushes to get help but finds that nobody is there. Horrified after seeing the two men with their mutilated faces coming toward her, she rushes into the bathroom and locks herself. To make matters worse, she finds the body of herself before being killed by Marina. Laura goes with Detective Cameron and his officer to watch the recorded footage of Isabelle which showed that the hospital staff were there revealing that she was hallucinating and slits her own throat out of madness, controlled by Marina. The footage was later posted on Laura's Facebook page. Tyler, Kobe and Olivia are unable to delete the videos, unfriend Laura or deactivate their account as unknown errors keep occurring, Laura's Facebook friend count continues to drop, while Tyler is looking for the address of Marina's home. Olivia turns off her phone, alongside laptop and moved out, fearing that she would share the same fate as Gustavo and Isabelle before bids farewell to Laura. Later, Laura notices the picture of Olivia from Marina's page, the picture slowly melts, implying that she is next. Laura and Tyler rushes in to save her, but Olivia is already attacked by Marina with wasps, hurled out of her window and hospitalized in stable condition. When Tyler and Detective Cameron are talking, Marina possesses Olivia through the heart monitor and lunges at Detective Cameron's officer, taking the gun from him. Instead of shooting the officer, she shoots herself in the head, killing Olivia.\n\nMeanwhile, Laura hunts down the place where Marina committed suicide in order to destroy the black mirror that turned Marina into an evil spirit, she and Kobe go to Marina's house which was burnt down and attempt to look for her. While there, Kobe sees an ethereal entity come out of the basement and approaches him, but disappears when Laura bumps into him. Laura tells him that Marina is not there, but he suggests that they look in the basement.\n\nMarina is not found in the basement, but while searching, Kobe is separated from Laura, who finds him staring into a black mirror. When she turns him around and asks what's wrong, he apologizes to Laura and says that she can't be lonely if she died. Kobe suddenly stabs her in the stomach, hoping to kill her in order to save himself and Tyler. Laura hits him with her flashlight and escapes from the basement as Kobe gives the chase but loses her. Laura then realizes through one of Marina's posts that Marina committed suicide in one of the nearby factories.\n\nMeanwhile, Tyler finds a deranged Kobe looking for Laura. After getting a call, Tyler and Kobe head to the factories as well, but he tells Kobe to stay in the car while he tried to find Laura. Once getting to the factories, a wounded Laura starts looking for Marina's body, she receives a video call from her mother, Caroline, who informs that she's been seeing Marina too. Laura's video call begins to glitch out as her mother begins to act strangely, a sign that she may be attacked by Marina. Caroline takes a knife from the table and goes to the other room, presumably killing herself as the connection times out. Devastated by her mother's presumed death, Laura begins to cry after seeing everyone she's loved being taken away. Tyler soon finds her, only their reunion is cut short when Kobe appears and stabs Tyler in the throat, killing him. Laura attempts to escape Kobe once again but reaches a dead end. However, before he can kill Laura, Kobe is violently attacked and killed by the swarm of wasps.\n\nLaura, feeling dazed, sees an apparition of two men (presumably the boys that bullied Marina in the orphanage). Laura yells at Marina, asking what she wants from her, the spirit of younger Marina appears and says that she wanted to be best friends with her as she leads Laura to Marina's rotten corpse and her laptop which transports Laura into one of Marina's earlier posts. Laura is then lunged at by a demonic Marina.\nSome time has passed and there are fresh batch of students. Laura is seen looking at some girls in the same way that Marina looked at Laura and her friends in the beginning. Laura then faces her laptop (which actually is Marina's laptop) and is shown to have zero friends, just like Marina before she met Laura. Then her new account which shares the same dark, grotesque images and renamed as Lau Ra is revealed. The camera shows Laura's eyes are green and blue, implying that Marina has possessed Laura.\n\n\nOriginally titled \"Unknown Error\", the film was later renamed to \"Friend Request\" internationally, to avoid confusion with the 2014 film \"Unfriended\". In Germany, the film is titled \"Unfriend\", since \"Unfriended\" was released as \"Unknown User\" in Germany.\n\nThe film was shot in Cape Town at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Though the film was produced by German director Simon Verhoeven and German production companies, the largely English-speaking cast required the film to be shot in English. Filming ended in March 2014.\n\nThe film was released in Germany on 7 January 2016, 20 April 2016 in the United Kingdom and in the United States on 22 September 2017.\n\n, \"Friend Request\" has grossed $3.5 million in the United States and Canada and $6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $9.5 million, against a production budget of $9.9 million.\n\nIn North America, the film was released alongside \"\" and \"The Lego Ninjago Movie\", and was initially projected to gross around $5 million from 2,569 theaters in its opening weekend. However, after grossing just $750,000 on its first day, weekend projections were lowered to $1.5–2 million. It ended up grossing $2 million, finishing 7th at the box office, and passing \"Victor Frankenstein\" for the worst opening gross for a film playing in over 2,500 theaters.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 17% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Friend Request\"s attempts to update old-school teen horror for the digital age do not, sadly, include memorable characters, fresh scares, or novel storytelling twists.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nFrank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the film for being \"visually stylish and imaginative\" but criticized it for becoming less interesting as the film went on. Jessica Kiang of \"Variety\" was impressed by the practical effects, but criticized the way the film had little to do with the \"technology that it ostensibly exists to critique\". Ally Wybrew of \"Empire\" gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, praising Debnam-Carey, who \"[stood] out [amongst] otherwise mediocre performances\" in contrast to the poorly written character of Marina. Wybrew went on to criticize the clunky lines, overenthusiastic score, and the protracted final act.\n"}

He was an avid reader from his childhood and used to read literary books, poetry, novels, autobiographies and was especially attracted towards the subject of history. However, due to early death of his father he was not able to pursue his education further and was compelled by the circumstances to go back to his hometown and lead his tribe along with taking care of his agricultural lands, fish farms and other businesses. Nevertheless, his devotion for academics and books made him read rich literature ranging from socialism to economics; this led him to become a polite, humble and upright man. He never compromised on principles and is regarded as one of the most upright politicians in Larkana.\n\nHis passion for books made him become discontent with the feudal mindset and prevailing wadera culture at that time. Hence, he joined Tehrik e Istiqlaal as a young leader and was appointed as member of Central working committee. He followed the footsteps of his father by revolting against the local feudals who used to suppress and exploit the masses. He went against the local feudals and protested against the dictatorial regime of Zia ul Haq; therefore, he embarked on a courageous journey to purge his area from feudals and as well as continued his struggle to revive democracy in Pakistan during the dictatorial regime of Zia ul Haq when he led the like minded people in protests. During the course of which it was discovered that he had dynamic oratory and was a passionate speaker. He was a leading member in the movement to restore democracy (MRD). For which, he was imprisoned in jail for one year without being given any right of trial. Unflinched by his resolve to restore democracy, all the cases against him were dismissed and he was freed following which he became a prominent local political leader in Larkana. His passion to serve people made him contest for the election of chairman baldia warah where he got elected unopposed. He served the people with utmost devotion and was called upon by the chief of PML-N, Mian Nawaz Sharif to join his party. Following which he formally joined the PML-N and was made the divisional president of Larkana and member central working committee of PML- N. From then onwards, there was no going back and Imdad Hussain Chandio emerged as one of the most prominent politicians of Sindh.\n\nImdad Hussain Chandio is regarded as one of the most respected and humble politicians of Sindh. It is because of his crystal clear past record and good reputation among the locals and politicians that he is said to earn nothing but respect. He is humble yet vociferous which could be judged by the fact that he stood like a might oak tree during the times of turmoil in the Musharraf era when every effort was made to lure him to join the PML-Q, but he refused categorically. His unwavering stance to stand by his parent political party (PML-N) strengthened democratic culture and showed the young party workers the way to pursue one's political commitments and ideology even in the face of grave threats and hardships. His speeches in various conferences, seminars, public rallies, demonstrations and television talk shows elicit that he is an epitome of a true leader who stands by his principles. He continues to stand by the democratic values of statesmanship, humbleness and uprightness. Mr. Imdad Hussain Chandio is considered to be persevering, steadfast and patient as he is considered as a pillar of MPL-N in Sindh, despite all the hardships he has faced in his political life be they: political cases, financial problems caused by the opposition, or tribal entanglements caused by a few notorious people.\n\nHis main contribution is to unite a very large number of Sindhi workers under the banner of his party and making PML(N) a popular mass party is Sindh.He is also called as Chief of Cholyani tribe. He also contributed a lot to resolve the tribal feuds among different tribes, and set the tradition of taking delegations to rival groups to convince and encourage them to resolve their bloody feuds through traditional dispute resolution mechanisms through the involvement of notables.Such community based dispute resolution is one of the main alternate to rival groups in the absence of rule of law and very corrupt judiciary and administration.\n\n"}

{"id": "871169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871169", "title": "Marty McSorley", "text": "Marty McSorley\n\nMartin James McSorley (born May 18, 1963) is a Canadian former professional hockey player, who played in the National Hockey League from 1983 until 2000. A versatile player, he was able to play both the forward and defense positions.\n\nA former head coach of the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League (2002–04), aside from his hockey career, McSorley has worked as an actor, appearing in several film and television roles. McSorley was a valued teammate of Wayne Gretzky during their years playing together for the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings, where he served as an enforcer. In 2000, his on-ice assault of Donald Brashear with his stick, in which Brashear suffered a severe concussion, led to McSorley's suspension and eventual retirement from the NHL.\n\nMcSorley was born in Hamilton, Ontario, but grew up near Cayuga, Haldimand County, Ontario. He made his NHL debut in October 1983 with the Pittsburgh Penguins, but rose to fame after a trade in September 1985 brought him to the Edmonton Oilers. His arrival and physical presence soon made Edmonton's incumbent enforcer Dave Semenko expendable, and McSorley inherited the title of \"Wayne Gretzky's bodyguard\".\n\nThis title would follow him to Los Angeles in 1988, when both he and Gretzky, along with Mike Krushelnyski, were obtained by the Kings. With the Kings, McSorley's bruising style made him a fan favorite; but he strove to improve his game beyond being primarily known as an enforcer, earning great respect around the league for his hard work ethic, his fine team play, and his articulate intelligence off the ice.\n\nIn the 1992–93 NHL regular season, McSorley led all defensemen in shorthanded goals with three.\n\nThe Kings reached the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Canadiens, but in Game 2 with the Kings up 2–1, McSorley was caught with an illegal stick, contributing to the Canadiens game-tying goal. Montreal ending up winning that game in overtime and ultimately took the series in five games. McSorley otherwise had ten points in the playoffs, and was the only King to score during the final game. Some suggested that he was the second most dominant King after Gretzky in the playoffs.\n\nMcSorley remained with the Kings until an August 1993 trade sent him to Pittsburgh in exchange for offensive forward Shawn McEachern; however, his stay in Pittsburgh would be brief (only 47 games). The Kings re-acquired him on February 16, 1994. Back with the Kings, he assisted on Gretzky's goal which broke Gordie Howe's all-time goal-scoring record. On March 14, 1996, McSorley left the Kings' organization for good, traded to the New York Rangers as part of a multi-player deal.\n\nAfter completing the 1995–96 season with the Rangers, McSorley returned to the West Coast after being acquired by the San Jose Sharks in August 1996. He spent two injury-plagued seasons with the Sharks before returning to Edmonton as a free agent in October 1998. Confined to a part-time role in his second stint in Edmonton, he left after one season and signed with the Boston Bruins in December 1999. As a Bruin, his NHL career would come to a sudden and infamous end in a game against the Vancouver Canucks on February 21, 2000.\n\nIn a game between the Bruins and the Canucks in Vancouver on February 21, 2000, McSorley swung his stick and hit Donald Brashear in the head with 4.6 seconds left in the game. Brashear fell backwards and hit his head hard on the ice, losing consciousness and suffering a Grade III concussion. McSorley was charged with assault and suspended by the NHL for the remainder of the 1999–2000 season (including the playoffs) missing 23 games. On October 6, 2000, Judge William Kitchen of the Provincial Court of British Columbia found him guilty of assault with a weapon for his attack on Brashear. He was sentenced to 18 months probation. The trial was the first for an on-ice attack by an NHL player since Dino Ciccarelli's 1988 trial.\n\nAfter his assault conviction, his NHL suspension was extended to one full year through February 21, 2001. McSorley would never play in another NHL game.\n\nDuring his suspension, he attempted to continue playing hockey in the United Kingdom with the London Knights, where his elder brother Chris was coaching, but this move was blocked by the International Ice Hockey Federation, in deference to the NHL suspension. A similar intention to play in Germany for the Munich Barons also failed, but he then played for the Grand Rapids Griffins in their final IHL season, dressing for 14 games.\n\nIn the autumn of 2001, following the completion of his suspension, McSorley again looked towards the other side of the Atlantic. He considered purchasing the then struggling Cardiff Devils team with his brother, in order to pursue a new player-coach role and to develop interest in the sport in the UK.\n\nMcSorley appeared as a guest player for both Great Britain and the Cardiff Devils during a series of games in November 2001, but the business deal failed to materialise.\n\nMcSorley coached the American Hockey League team the Springfield Falcons between 2002 and 2004.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1997, McSorley also appeared in four movies in small roles: \"Bad Boys\" (1995), \"Forget Paris\" (1995), \"Con Air\" (1997) and \"Do Me A Favor\" (1997).\n\nDuring the 2005–06 NHL season, McSorley worked for Fox Sports West in Los Angeles, providing in-studio analysis of games involving the Los Angeles Kings or the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He provided color commentary for the San Jose Sharks games on FSN Bay Area during 2006–07 NHL season. McSorley's time in that role ended mysteriously midway through the Sharks playoff series with Detroit, when the Sharks announced McSorley would not return for a Game 3 broadcast for personal reasons. No further explanation was given.\n\nHe appeared in one episode of \"CSI: Miami\" in 2005 as rink manager Andrew Greven. On July 30, 2007, McSorley guest starred on ABC Family's \"Greek\" as himself playing a hockey goaltender. In February 2008, McSorley was featured as one of the pros on \"Pros vs Joes\" on Spike TV.\n\nCanadian singer-songwriter Kathleen Edwards referred to McSorley in her song \"I Make the Dough, You Get the Glory\", with the lyric, \"You're the Great One, I'm Marty McSorley..., I make the dough, but you get the glory.\" McSorley appears in the song's music video.\n\nMcSorley is currently a TV analyst for Sportsnet and occasionally \"Hockey Night in Canada\". He is a regular at Staples Center during Kings hockey games.\n\nMcSorley currently resides in Hermosa Beach, California. He married beach volleyball player Leanne Schuster in August 2002. They have three children.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The funds allegedly came from state-owned companies' advertising budgets, funneled through an advertising agency owned by Marcos Valério. The investigation has since uncovered members of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, DEM, Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and seven other political parties also involved. Many key advisers to Lula resigned, and several deputies were faced with the choice of resignation or expulsion from congress, though the president himself went on to be re-elected in 2006, and in 2010 Brazil elected his chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff, as president. Much of PT's leadership was affected in some way, with many resigning or failing to win re-election. Brazil's economy was widely perceived as not having been substantially impacted by the scandal.\n\nRoberto Jefferson, who initially sparked the scandal, was expelled from the Chamber of Deputies on September 14, 2005 for ethical violations determined by the Congressional Council of Ethics. Despite continued additional resignations, in October the scandal died down somewhat as Brazil held a contentious referendum on a banning gun sales, an initiative soundly rejected by voters.\n\nOn September 18, 2004 Brazilian weekly magazine \"Veja\" printed a cover story entitled \"Scandal: PT's buyout of PTB\". The article described an alliance between the Workers Party (PT) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). According to \"Veja\", PT promised to pay R$150,000 to each PTB deputy if they would support the executive branch . Allegedly because these promises were not kept, a storm of corruption allegations against PT began in May 2005.\n\nOn September 24, 2004, the Rio de Janeiro newspaper \"Jornal do Brasil\" published an article citing \"Veja\" which also said that former Minister of Communications Miro Teixeira had revealed the monthly payments to the Ministry of Public Prosecution.\n\n\"Jornal do Brasil\" then published another story saying that the president of the Chamber of Deputies João Paulo Cunha (PT) promised to fully investigate the claims and quoted president of the Popular Socialist Party (Brazil) Roberto Freire saying: \"This subject has been circulating for months in Congress but nobody has the courage to approach it.\"\n\nOn May 14, 2005, \"Veja\" published a new story describing an apparent corruption scheme in the Brazilian Postal Service, describing a 110-minute video recording, made with a hidden camera, that showed former Post Office Chief apparently receiving a bribe from a businessman. The full bribery scheme involving government contracts was allegedly administered by Post Office administrative director Antônio Osório Batista and by Jefferson, a Post Office manager as well as a federal deputy. On the tape, Marinho receives then pockets R$3,000 (about $1,259 US) in cash. The recording was aired by the major Brazilian television stations.\n\nAgents from the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN) investigated. As the scandal developed, it was argued that this was linked to an attempt to destroy PT's former allies without the scandal exploding upon the government. However, a major political battle began when the government tried to systematically obstruct the creation of a Parliamentary Commission of Investigation (CPI) to investigate the growing corruption scandal.\n\nOn June 3, 2005 the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo published a story saying that the government was tying funds for various projects to support for the creation of the CPI. Because of these allegations, part of the government's base joined the opposition to support the creation of a Parliamentary Commission of Investigation. Abandoned by his allies, Jefferson began to counterattack. On June 6, \"Folha de S.Paulo\" published an interview with Jefferson claiming that Delúbio Soares, treasurer of the Workers' Party, made monthly payments of R$30,000 to certain Congressional deputies, to influence them to vote with the government. Jefferson said that those who received the monthly payment called it mensalão, derived from the Portuguese word for a monthly payment. \"Mensalão\" quickly became the adopted popular label for the scandal, now identified as the \"escândalo do mensalão.\"\n\nAccording to Jefferson, businessman Marcos Valério, owner of the advertising agencies and DNA, which had large government contracts, operated the scheme. After the investigative commission was set up, the government allegedly tried to control it by installing government allies Senator Delcídio do Amaral (PT) as president of the commission and Deputy Osmar Serraglio (PMDB) as the key \"rapporteur\", responsible for writing the final report. \n\nAlthough the investigation of the Post Office scandal was officially restricted in scope to irregularities in Post Office's administration, it began to investigate the expanding monthly payment claims because of apparent connections between the cases. An additional commission was created to investigate the broader scandal on July 20. Allies of the government occupied key posts. The president of the CPI was Senator and the \"rapporteur\" was Deputy Ibrahim Abi-Ackel. Abi-Ackel was minister of justice in the government of João Baptista Figueiredo, and was also accused of involvement in the corruption scandal.\n\nJosé Dirceu, once a leftist student leader who organized against the right-wing military dictatorship after it took power in a 1964 coup, was arrested in 1968, then released at the demand of the kidnappers of the US ambassador. He was exiled to Cuba. Later, he secretly returned to Brazil, under a false identity and had plastic surgery to disguise his face. He hid in Paraná and opened a shop. During this time, he became involved as a student union leader. He married but did not reveal his true identity even after he had a son with his wife. Only after 1979, when political amnesty was declared, did he openly return to political life, campaigning for democratic elections and the end of the dictatorship regime.\n\nAs a consequence of the \"mensalão scandal\", Dirceu resigned in 2005 as chief of staff to President Lula.\n\nIn early July 2005, an advisor to a Congressional deputy and brother of Workers’ Party President José Genoíno, was stopped at an airport with $100,000 in his underwear and additional funds in his luggage. The wives and secretaries of key figures testified in the numerous and overlapping Congressional panels, including Valério's secretary, , and the ex-wife of Valdemar Costa Neto, Maria Christina Mendes Caldeira, who later fled to the United States with nothing but her clothes and a support animal. She applied for asylum under a secret identity.\n\nCongressional hearings were often marked by fiery rhetoric and emotional outbursts, including numerous incidents of crying by witnesses and Workers' Party deputies. Although still murky and unclear, reported links between the scandal, its key figures, the murder of Santo André's mayor Celso Daniel and various mafia and criminal figures only intensified its sensational tone and societal impact. One key event that broadened the scandal into a more general investigation of the Workers' Party history as whole was the testimony of Duda Mendonça, public relations specialist and campaign manager for Lula's 2002 campaign, on August 11. He said he was paid using off-shore bank accounts and possibly illegal funds connected to Valério.\n\nThe scandal, which had at that time not yet involved Brazil's finance minister, said to be popular with the international finance community, threatened Antonio Palocci's standing after lawyer and former advisor testified that Palocci was involved in corrupt activities while he was mayor of Ribeirão Preto in the mid-90's.\n\nLula's popularity waxed and waned, but no definite proof emerged that he orchestrated or had knowledge of the payments. Much of PT's leadership was affected in some way, with many resigning or failing to win re-election. Brazil's economy was widely perceived as not having been substantially impacted by the scandal.\n\nRoberto Jefferson, who initially sparked the scandal, was expelled from the Chamber of Deputies on September 14, 2005 after the Congressional Council of Ethics determined that he had committed ethical violations. Despite continued resignations of those implicated, in October the scandal died down somewhat and Brazil had a referendum on gun sales that resulted in a loss for the government's position. At the end of October, \"Veja\" published a new story claiming that the Workers' Party had received illegal campaign funds from Cuba—threatening to re-intensify the scandal once again, though that was not ultimately the case.\n\nThe investigations into Post Office corruption and vote-buying unanimously approved their first joint preliminary report on September 1, 2005.\n\nThe report accused 18 Brazilian deputies of involvement in the corruption scandal:\n\nThe report accused them of misdeeds ranging from illegal campaign finance activity, placing cronies in strategic positions in government-owned businesses in return for kickbacks, to taking cash payments for voting with the government in the Brazilian Congress.\n\nThe report states that as to the charges initially made by deputy Roberto Jefferson (PTB):\n\nThe report added that several documents had been identified and validated which proved that large sums of money were withdrawn from agencies of the Rural Bank in Brasilia and Belo Horizonte, as well as from the bank accounts of the enterprises and DNA. According to the documents, the beneficiaries were federal deputies who received funds in person or through relatives, advisers, or individuals chosen by Marcos Valério. Some payments were made monthly, and others either more or less frequently. \nThe report called the defense made by some parliamentarians that the funds were used to settle debts from electoral campaigns a \"lame excuse\".\n\nThe following CPIs were involved in investigating issues related to the cash-for-votes scandal.\n\n\nMembers of the opposition also wanted a fourth CPI to investigate off-book accounts held by all parties in during the most recent elections. Due to serial allegations of this kind of operation in many campaigns in 2002, including President Lula's, many believed this CPI could result in a legal and concrete reason to start his impeachment process. However this process was aborted.\n\nThe Council of Ethics and Parliamentary Decorum of the House is responsible for processing and disciplining members for behavior not in concordance with parliamentary decorum.\n\nTo expel a deputy, 257 votes out of 513 are needed. Expelled deputies lose their seats and also their parliamentary privileges and immunity. Members can also be barred from holding public office for eight years. Jefferson for example cannot run for office again until 2015.\n\nOn August 24, 2007, the Supreme Federal Court, responsible for criminal proceedings against parliamentarians due to parliamentary immunity, accepted the indictments of 40 individuals related to the Mensalão scandal, most of them former or current federal deputies, and all of whom were or are allies of former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe trial began in August 2012.\n\nIn the first 23 sessions of the trial the Supreme Court found that misuse of public money and bank loans did occur. Ten of the 37 defendants received sentences, including Marcos Valério, a ringleader. Three were acquitted.\n\nOn 15 September 2012 \"Veja\" published a new story alleging that Valério had told friends that former president Lula masterminded the corruption scheme. José Dirceu's allies called this a lie and said Valério was out of his head and desperate, a convict facing prison.\n\nOn September 17 the court began to examine the primary accusation, which included allegations that Dirceu led of the vote-buying scheme which laundered and then disbursed millions in public and private money to secure votes in Congress from 2003 to 2005. The \"rapporteur\" found clear evidence that such activities occurred, saying \"there is no doubt that this scheme existed.\"\n\nOn 9 October 2012, the court found Dirceu, José Genoino and Delúbio Soares guilty of bribery (\"Corrupção Ativa\"). On 15 November 2013 the STF president ordered them imprisoned. This coincided with the anniversary of the proclamation of the Republic so there was much debate about Barbosa's reasons for waiting until then. Some days later Genoino was transferred to house arrest out of concerns about his health.\n\nDocuments from the Conselho de Controle de Atividades Financeiras (COAF) indicate that between July and May 2003, withdrawals of 27 million reais were made from the accounts of businessman Marcos Valério.\n\nAccording to deputy Roberto Jefferson, the money for the mensalão came from Banco Rural and the Banco do Brasil. Documents from COAF validate the withdrawals from Banco Rural; the withdrawals from the Banco do Brasil have not yet been traced.\n\nThe table below shows a side-by-side description of some of the withdrawals and allegedly connected votes in the Senate and Chamber of Deputies.\nSource:\"Reuters\".\n\n\nThe following members of other parties that gave political support to the Workers' Party before the scandal: PTB, PP, PL, and the PMDB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Established in 1993, as the educational arm of human rights organization, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, MOT also deals with atrocities in Cambodia and Latin America, along with issues like bullying and hate crimes. The MOT has an associated museum and professional development multi-media training facility in New York City.\n\nThe original museum in Los Angeles, California opened in 1993, built at a cost of $50 million by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, named after Simon Wiesenthal, Holocaust survivor. The museum receives 350,000 visitors annually, about a third of which are school-age children. The museum's most talked-about exhibit is \"The Holocaust Section\", where visitors are divided into groups to take their own place in some of the events of World War II. These experiences are then discussed afterwards. The museum also features testimonies of Holocaust survivors, often from live volunteers who tell their stories and answer questions. People also get cards with pictures of Jewish children on them and at the end of the museum trip, it is revealed whether the child on the card survived or died in the Holocaust.\n\nIn addition, the museum features a \"Tolerancenter\" that discusses issues of prejudice in everyday life, a Multimedia Learning Center, Finding Our Families – Finding Ourselves, a collection of archives and documents, various temporary exhibits such as Los Angeles visual artist Bill Cormalis Jr's \"A\" Game In The B Leagues,\" which documents through paintings, the Civil Rights movement during the segregation of colored people in Major League Baseball, and an Arts and Lectures Program.\n\nA classroom visit to the museum is featured in the 2007 movie \"Freedom Writers\", based on the real-life story of high school teacher Erin Gruwell and her students. The museum was parodied in an episode of \"South Park\" called \"The Death Camp of Tolerance\".\n\nThe birth of the museum was related to the leadership of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, an international Jewish human rights organization named in honor of famed Nazi hunter, the late Simon Wiesenthal. With the impetus to promote tolerance and understanding among today's world and to educate more young people, the Simon Wiesenthal Center made a decision to create a museum. In February 1993, the Museum of Tolerance opened to the public, which carries the mission to not only remind us of the past, but remind us to act. It soon received both national and international acclaims, and became a “must-see” attraction in Southern California. Today over 250,000 people visit the MOT annually, including 130,000 students.\n\nThe Holocaust\n\nA seventy minute dramatic presentation that takes visitors back to the period between 1920s and 1945 in Nazi-dominated Europe. Each visitor receives a photo passport card with the story of a child living during the Holocaust. As visitors explore different areas, such as a recreation of a Berlin Outdoor Café and a specially designed Hall of Testimony, the passport cards keep updating with the drastic changes in the children's lives. At the end of the tour, the ultimate fate of the child is revealed. Some artifacts of Auschwitz are displayed.\n\nTolerancenter\n\nVisitors focus on the major issues of intolerance in daily life through seven exhibits: the Point of View Diner, the Millennium Machine, \"Ain't You Gotta Right?\", In Our Time, GlobalHate.com, We the People, Making Your Mark. These exhibits feature some recreations of historical places, films, visual walls, writing forums.\n\nAnne\n\nExhibit of Anne Frank's life and legacies through rare artifacts, unique documents, and photographs presented with multi-media technology. Visitors can experience the 260-degree filmic dramatization of Anne’s room in the Secret Annex. In the Interactive Action Lab visitors can reflect on what they have learned, relate the historical issues back to today's world, and write a pledge to share on social media through multi-touch tables. A reproduction of Anne's original diary and facsimile of handwritten loose leaf sheets are displayed.\n\nFinding Our Families, Finding Ourselves\n\nThe exhibit showcases several noted Americans with diverse personal histories. Their journeys examine those family members that inspired them, and encourages visitors to seek out their own histories, mentors and heroes.\n\nPara Todos Los Niños / For All The Children\n\nThis exhibition shares the story of the landmark struggles of Latino families in Southern California and shows the history of segregation and discrimination in California that targeted all non-White citizens, in housing, jobs, and schools. Visitors can learn of those, including Mendez v. Westminster, who battled segregated schools for all.\n\nMany major  corporations, educators, police agencies, and professionals from throughout the region have experienced the MOT’s specialized programs. The MOT’s unique interactive exhibits provide a hands-on learning experience that inspires visitors of all ages to learn from the past, engage in the present and assume responsibility for the future through the exploration of the meaning of tolerance.\n\nMOT's customized Youth Programs include introduction about the Holocaust and anti-bullying workshops, specially designed for different age groups. Special Speakers section offers an opportunity of daily presentations for visitors to hear live personal testimonies from Holocaust Survivors. MOT also provides online Teacher Resources to help teachers optimize the learning experiences for their students as well as sustain the learning long after the Museum visit, which includes lesson plans, vocabulary, bibliographies, and much more. Professional Development Programs challenges adult learners to see the world differently and redefine their roles in it. Lifelong Learners Programs include arts and lectures events, special exhibitions, and volunteer training education. Library and Archives facilitates more in-depth research about the Holocaust and offers rare collections, a digital archives, and reference staff and volunteers who offer support. Since the opening of the museum, collection of materials has expanded to include tolerance, racism, multiculturalism, civil rights, and human rights.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7083789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7083789", "title": "Muslim minority of Greece", "text": "Muslim minority of Greece\n\nThe Muslim minority of Greece is the only explicitly recognized minority in Greece. It numbers 97,605 (0.91% of the population) according to the 1991 census, and unofficial estimates ranged up to 140,000 people or 1.24% of the total population, according to the United States Department of State. \n\nLike other parts of the southern Balkans that experienced centuries of Ottoman rule the Muslim minority of mainly Western Thrace in Northern Greece consists of several ethnic groups, some being Turkish and some Bulgarian-speaking Pomaks, with smaller numbers descended from Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam and Muslim Romas. The precise identity of these groups is in contention with Turkey insisting that most Muslims in Western Thrace are ethnically Turkish, and Greece claiming many are Pomak and others of local origin who converted to Islam and adopted the Turkish language and identity in the Ottoman period. These arguments have territorial overtones, since the self-identity of the Muslims in Western Thrace could conceivably support territorial claims to the region by Turkey.\n\nThe Muslims of Western Thrace were exempt from the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey (when all of the 1.5 million surviving Anatolian Greeks or Pontic Greeks and Caucasus Greeks were required to leave Turkey, and the 356,000 Muslims outside of Thrace were required to leave Greece, including the Muslim Greek Vallahades of western Greek Macedonia. Consequently, most of the Muslim minority in Greece resides in the Greek region of Thrace, where they make up 28.88% of the population. Muslims form the largest group in the Rhodope regional unit (41.77%) and sizable percentages in the Xanthi (31.19%) and Evros regional units (4.65%).\n\nNearly 300 Turks remain on the island of Rhodes and 200 on the island of Kos, as the islands were part of the Italian Dodecanese when the population exchange between Turkey and Greece happened (and so were not included in it).\n\nUnder the Treaty of Lausanne, 1923, Greece and Turkey conducted a population exchange: all the Greek Orthodox Christians of Turkey would be resettled in Greece apart from the Greeks of Istanbul (Constantinople), Imbros (Gökçeada) and Tenedos (Bozcaada), and all Turks of Greece would be resettled in Turkey apart from the Muslims of Greek Thrace.\nThe exchanged populations were not homogenous; the Christians resettled in Greece included not only Greek speakers, but also Georgian speakers, Arabic speakers and even Turkish speakers. Similarly, the Muslims resettled in Turkey included not only Turkish speakers, but also Albanian speakers, Bulgarian speakers, Vlach speakers and also Greek speakers like the Vallahades from western Greek Macedonia (see also Greek Muslims). This was in correspondence with the Millet system of the Ottoman Empire, where religious and national allegiance coincided, and thus Greece and Turkey were considered the parent state of each group respectively.\n\nIn 1922, the Muslim minority left in Western Thrace, in Northern Greece, numbered approximately 86,000 people, and consisted of three ethnic groups: Turks (here usually referred to as Western Thrace Turks), Pomaks (Muslim Slavs who speak Bulgarian), and Muslim Roma, each of these groups having its own language and culture. The official Greek text of the Treaty of Lausanne refers to \"muslim minorities\" in article 45 However, unofficial texts of the Greek State refer to one Muslim minority. According to the Greek government, Turkish speakers form approximately 50% of the minority, Pomaks 35% and Muslim Roma 15%.\nThe minority enjoys full equality with the Greek majority, and prohibition against discrimination and freedom of religion are provided for in Article 5 and Article 13 of the Greek constitution. In Thrace today there are 3 muftis, approximately 270 imams and approximately 300 mosques.\n\nThe minority is always represented in the Greek parliament, and is currently represented by PASOK members Çetin Mandacı and Ahmet Hacıosman. During the 2002 local elections, approximately 250 Muslim municipal and prefectural councillors and mayors were elected, and the Vice-Prefect of Rhodope is also a Muslim. The main minority rights activist organization of the Turkish community within the minority is the \"Turkish Minority Movement for Human and Minority Rights\" (Greek: Τούρκικη Μειονοτική Κίνηση για τα Ανθρώπινα και Μειονοτικά Δικαιώματα, \"Toúrkiki Meionotikí Kínisi yia ta Anthrópina kai Meionotiká Dikaiómata\", ).\n\nIn Thrace today there are 235 minority primary schools, where education is in the Greek and Turkish languages, and there are also two minority secondary schools, one in Xanthi and one in Komotini, where most of the minority is concentrated. In the remote mountainous areas of Xanthi where the Pomak element is dominant, the Greek government has set up Greek language secondary education schools in which religious studies is taught in Turkish and the Quran is taught in Arabic. The Pomak language (which is essentially considered a dialect of Bulgarian), however, is not taught at any level of the education system. The government finances the transportation to and from the schools for students who live in remote areas, and in the academic year 1997-98, approximately 195,000 USD was spent on transportation.\n\nThere are two Islamic theological seminaries, one in Komotini, and one in Echinos (a small town in Xanthi regional unit inhabited almost exclusively by Pomaks), and under Law 2621/1998, the qualification awarded by these institutions has been recognized as equal to that of the Greek Orthodox seminaries in the country.\n\nFinally, 0.5% of places in Greek higher education institutions are reserved for members of the minority.\n\nAll the aforementioned institutions are funded by the state.\n\nThe main minority grievance regards the appointment of muftis. The Greek government started appointing muftis instead of holding elections after the death of Mufti of Komotini in 1985, although the Greek government maintained that as the practice of state-appointed muftis is widespread (including in Turkey), this practice should be adhered to in Greece, and as the muftis perform certain judicial functions in matters of family and inheritance law, the state ought to appoint them. Human Rights Watch alleges that this is against Lausanne Treaty which grants the Muslim minority the right to organize and conduct religious affairs free from government interference (although it is unclear whether issues such as inheritance law are religious matters). As such, there are two muftis for each post, one elected by the participating faithful, and one appointed by Presidential Decree. The elected Mufti of Xanthi is Mr Aga and the government recognized one is Mr Sinikoğlu; the elected Mufti of Komotini is Mr Şerif and the government recognized one is Mr Cemali. According to the Greek government, the elections by which Mr Aga and Mr Şerif were appointed were rigged and involved very little participation from the minority. As pretension of (religious) authority is a criminal offence against the lawful muftis under the Greek Penal Code, both elected muftis were prosecuted and on conviction, both were imprisoned and fined. When, however, the case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights, the Greek government was found to have violated the right to religious freedom of Mr Aga and Mr Şerif.\n\nAnother controversial issue was Article 19 of the Greek Citizenship Code, which allowed the government to revoke the citizenship of non-ethnic Greeks who left the country. According to official statistics 46,638 Muslims (most of them being of Turkish origin) from Thrace and the Dodecanese islands lost their citizenships from 1955 to 1998, until the law was non-retroactively abolished in 1998.\n\nThe final controversial issue is the use of the ethnic terms \"Turk\" and \"Turkish\" when describing the religious minority as a whole. The Greek government is not referring to the Muslim minority by a specific ethnic background such as Turks, as it is a multi-ethnic minority that includes Pomaks and Roma Muslims as well. However, a number of organizations which are doing so, including the \"Turkish Union of Xanthi\", have been banned for using those terms in their title. In 2008 after a decision of the European Court of Human Rights ruled the re-legalization of the association and convicted Greece of violating the freedom of association, however, the Greek authorities refused to re-legalize it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "143846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143846", "title": "Old boy network", "text": "Old boy network\n\nAn old boy network, or society (also old boys' club), can refer to social and business connections among former pupils of male-only private schools. The term originated from much of the British elite having attended certain public schools as boys, thus former pupils are \"old boys\".\n\nThis can apply to the network between the graduates of a single school regardless of their gender. It is also known as an \"old boy society\" and is similar to an alumni association. It can also mean a network of social and business connections among the alumni of various prestigious schools. In popular language, \"old boy network\" or \"old boy society\" has come to be used in reference to the preservation of social elites in general; such connections within the British Civil Service formed a primary theme in the British Broadcasting Corporation's satirical comedy series \"Yes Minister\". The phrase \"It's not what you know, it's who you know\" is associated with this tradition.\n\nIn Australia, the term \"Old Boy\" is used to describe a male alumnus of some prestigious state and private schools. The term \"Old Girl\" is similarly used for a female alumna of such schools.\n\nThe term is also used in Canada, where the alumni of such schools as St. Andrew's College, Trinity College School, Crescent School, St George's School, Bishop's College School, Hillfield Strathallan College, Lower Canada College, and Upper Canada College are known as Old Boys. Other influential private schools with powerful alumni networks may have become co-ed, such as Appleby College or University of Toronto Schools, but operate similarly in which large numbers of alumni all work for the same organization. The old boy network of Upper Canada College has been so influential in the political and business realms of Canada that it became the focus of James Fitzgerald's 1994 book \"Old Boys: The Powerful Legacy of Upper Canada College\" ().\n\nIn Finland, the Finnish term hyvä veli -verkosto (literally \"dear brother network\") is used to refer to the alleged informal network of men in high places whose members use their influence to pervert or circumvent official decision-making processes to the members' mutual benefit. As such, the term is pejorative.\n\nThe term derives from the salutation \"Hyvä veli!\", or \"Dear brother!\", traditionally used to open a letter to a not quite intimate friend. The implication is that since the elites of all fields are drawn from a fairly small pool of people who are mostly more or less acquainted with each other, they can and often do manage public and private affairs amongst themselves, off the record, and outside public scrutiny as they like. As the word \"brother\" implies, the network is usually presumed to be consisting of males, and thus the term is also sometimes used to refer to the marginalization of women and their exclusion from high positions in both the public and private spheres. There is an equivalent term, \"hyvä sisko\" (\"dear sister\"), used in reference to informal networks of women in high positions.\n\nPresident Urho Kekkonen was notable for directly communicating with senior officials (past his cabinets) by means of letters, which famously began with the salutation \"Hyvä veli\". These have been published in three volumes.\n\nThe Doon School maintains its own old boys' society (The Doon School Old Boys' Society) for social connections and fundraising on behalf of the School. Graduates of The Doon School are known as \"Doscos\", or simply, as Old Boys. \n\nFormer students of the Welham Boys School refer to their society as the Welham Old Boys Society. Though the school was founded in 1937, the society was not founded until 1983. The group is intended to encourage Welham graduates to aid in the school's success through their union; they have established scholarships and bursaries for deserving students. The Welham Old Boys Network has established definite membership criteria, as well as requiring a subscription fee.\n\nSimilarly the Old Boys of Sainik School Rewa in Madhya Pradesh call their Old Boys Association as \"Sainwinians.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the \"old boy network\" is seen as existing primarily among those educated at the fee-paying independent schools of the Eton Group and the Rugby Group (including, but not limited to, Harrow School, Eton College, Shrewsbury School, Charterhouse School, Westminster School, Winchester College, Radley College, Wellington College, and Rugby School, as well as at the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, although to some extent such networks exist for all institutions producing large numbers of \"old boys\" and girls. The existence of \"old boy\" networks is often blamed for the high proportion of former pupils of high-status schools and universities in high-status positions in government, business, and other professions. For instance, between them, Harrow and Eton have 26 British prime ministers among their old boys. In practice, attendance at certain educational institutions is typical of the British \"ruling class\" and upper middle class, and where nepotism exists it may be driven more often by personal relationships than by educational networks.\n\nAn organisation called Future First promotes the use of such networks among those educated at state schools.\n\nThe term can also refer to the networks that are set up in the more elite secondary schools, such as Diocesan Boys' School, Queen's College, Ying Wa College, La Salle College and Saint Joseph's College.\n\nIn New Zealand, many schools maintain old boys/girls/students associations, however the term 'Old boy network' is typically used in reference to the elite public and private secondary schools such as Auckland Grammar School, King's College, Christ's College and Scots College\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13821882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13821882", "title": "Payroll giving", "text": "Payroll giving\n\nPayroll Giving, Workplace Giving or Give As You Earn (GAYE) is a tax free way for UK taxpayers to give money to UK Registered Charities.\n\nIntroduced in 1987, Payroll Giving is a simple, tax efficient scheme which allows employees to give money to the UK registered charity of their choice by having a deduction taken straight from their gross pay. There is no tax for the charity to claim back, as no tax was deducted.\n\nSome companies have put in place a matching gift programme to match or part match their employee donations via Payroll Giving.\n\nMore than 8,500 employers in the UK currently operate the scheme, and circa 2% of UK employees participate. Participating employers deduct agreed sums of money from their employees pay before calculating tax, and forward the money to a payroll giving agency; the agency then distributes the money to registered UK charities in accordance with the employees wishes (minus an administration fee, which may vary considerably between agencies). Approximately 40% of employers cover this administration fee on behalf of their employees.\n\nPayroll giving is operated by several agencies which do the administration and processing to link the donations to the correct charities. Employers have to choose which agency to operate with and may not pay the charities directly.\n\nPayroll Giving is promoted within workplaces by a number of Professional Fundraising Organisations or charities\n\nThe UK has a progressive Income Tax system with a top rate in 2015 of 45%. For higher rate tax payers this is a simpler way to donate to charity tax effectively than Gift Aid, as Gift Aid assumes all donations are from Basic rate Taxpayers (20% rate).\n\nIt is nonetheless possible to achieve the same result using Gift Aid, regardless of which tax band the donor is in, because the Gift Aid scheme allows higher rate taxpayers to reclaim the difference between higher and basic rate taxes. For example, if a donor gives £80 via Gift Aid, this is equivalent to donating £100 via Payroll Giving. In both cases, the benefit to the charity is £100 (disregarding the Transitional Relief payable until April 2011). The cost to a basic rate taxpayer is £80 in both cases, as the £100 paid by Payroll Giving would otherwise have been taxed at 20%. The cost to a higher rate taxpayer is £60 for the Payroll Giving donation (£100 less 40%), and initially £80 for the Gift Aid donation, although the higher rate taxpayer can later reclaim the £20 difference through his/her tax return.\n\nAs part of a broader corporate social responsibility policy, Payroll Giving offers employees the opportunity to channel their support for their social concerns whilst at the same time demonstrating the company’s credentials as a socially responsible business.

{"id": "51511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51511", "title": "Prince", "text": "Prince\n\nA prince is a male ruler ranked below a king and above a duke or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. \"Prince\" is also a title of nobility, often hereditary, in some European states. The feminine equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word \"prince\", from the Latin noun \"princeps\", from \"primus\" (first) + \"capio\" (to seize), meaning \"the chief, most distinguished, ruler, prince\".\n\nThe Latin word \"prīnceps\" (older Latin *prīsmo-kaps, literally \"the one who takes the first [place/position]\"), became the usual title of the informal leader of the Roman senate some centuries before the transition to empire, the \"princeps senatus\".\n\nEmperor Augustus established the formal position of monarch on the basis of \"principate\", not \"dominion\". He also tasked his grandsons as summer rulers of the city when most of the government were on holiday in the country or attending religious rituals, and, for that task, granted them the title of \"princeps\".\n\nThe title has generic and substantive meanings:\n\nThe original, but now less common use of the word, originated in the application of the Latin word \"princeps\", from late Roman law, and the classical system of government that eventually gave way to the European feudal society. In this sense, a prince is a ruler of a territory which is sovereign, or quasi-sovereign, i.e., exercising substantial (though not all) prerogatives associated with monarchs of independent nations, as was common, for instance, within the historical boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire. In medieval and Early Modern Europe, there were as many as two hundred such territories, especially in Italy, Germany, and Gaelic Ireland. In this sense, \"prince\" is used of any and all rulers, regardless of actual title or precise rank. This is the Renaissance use of the term found in Niccolò Machiavelli's famous work, \"Il Principe\".\n\nAs a title, by the end of the medieval era, \"prince\" was borne by rulers of territories that were either substantially smaller than or exercised fewer of the rights of sovereignty than did emperors and kings. A lord of even a quite small territory might come to be referred to as a \"prince\" before the 13th century, either from translations of a native title into the Latin \"princeps\" (as for the hereditary ruler of Wales), or when the lord's territory was allodial. The lord of an allodium owned his lands and exercised prerogatives over the subjects in his territory absolutely, owing no feudal homage or duty as a vassal to a liege lord, nor being subject to any higher jurisdiction. Most small territories designated as principalities during feudal eras were allodial, e.g. the Princedom of Dombes.\n\nLords who exercised lawful authority over territories and people within a feudal hierarchy were also sometimes regarded as \"princes\" in the general sense, especially if they held the rank of count or higher. This is attested in some surviving styles for e.g., British earls, marquesses, and dukes are still addressed by the Crown on ceremonial occasions as \"high and noble princes\" (cf. Royal and noble styles).\n\nIn parts of the Holy Roman Empire in which primogeniture did not prevail (e.g., Germany), all legitimate agnates had an equal right to the family's hereditary titles. While this meant that offices, such as emperor, king, and elector could only be legally occupied by one dynast at a time, holders of such other titles as duke, margrave, landgrave, count palatine, and prince could only differentiate themselves by adding the name of their appanage to the family's original title. Not only did this tend to proliferate unwieldy titles (e.g. Princess Katherine of Anhalt-Zerbst, or Karl, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken-Neukastell-Kleeburg, or Prince Christian Charles of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön-Norburg), but as agnatic primogeniture gradually became the norm in the Holy Roman Empire by the end of the 18th century, another means of distinguishing the monarch from other members of his dynasty became necessary. Gradual substitution of the title of \"Prinz\" for the monarch's title of \"Fürst\" occurred, and became customary for cadets in all German dynasties except in the grand duchies of Mecklenburg and Oldenburg. Both \"Prinz\" and \"Fürst\" are translated into English as \"prince\", but they reflect not only different but mutually exclusive concepts.\n\nThis distinction had evolved before the 18th century (Liechtenstein long remained an exception, cadets and females using \"Fürst/Fürstin\" into the 19th century) for dynasties headed by a \"Fürst\" in Germany. The custom spread through the Continent to such an extent that a renowned imperial general who belonged to a cadet branch of a reigning ducal family, remains best known to history by the generic dynastic title, \"Prince Eugene of Savoy\". Note that the princely title was used as a prefix to his Christian name, which also became customary.\n\nCadets of France's other \"princes étrangers\" affected similar usage under the Bourbon kings. Always facing the scepticism of Saint-Simon and like-minded courtiers, these quasi-royal aristocrats' assumption of the princely title as a personal, rather than territorial, designation encountered some resistance. In writing \"Histoire Genealogique et Chonologique\", Père Anselme accepts that, by the end of the 17th century, the heir apparent to the House of La Tour d'Auvergne's sovereign duchy bears the title, \"prince de Bouillon\", but he would record in 1728 that the heir's \"La Tour\" cousin, the Count of Oliergues, is \"\"known as\" the Prince Frederick\" (\"\"dit\" le prince Frédéric\").\n\nThe post-medieval rank of \"gefürsteter Graf\" (princely count) embraced but elevated the German equivalent of the intermediate French, English and Spanish nobles. In the Holy Roman Empire, these nobles rose to dynastic status by preserving from the Imperial crown (\"de jure\" after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648) the exercise of such sovereign prerogatives as the minting of money; the muster of military troops and the right to wage war and contract treaties; local judicial authority and constabular enforcement; and the habit of inter-marrying with sovereign dynasties. By the 19th century, cadets of a \"Fürst\" would become known as \"Prinzen\".\n\nThe husband of a queen regnant is usually titled \"prince consort\" or simply \"prince\", whereas the wives of male monarchs take the female equivalent (e.g., empress, queen) of their husband's title. In Brazil, Portugal and Spain, however, the husband of a female monarch was accorded the masculine equivalent of her title (e.g., emperor, king), at least after he fathered her heir. In previous epochs, husbands of queens regnant were often deemed entitled to the crown matrimonial, sharing their consorts' regnal title and rank \"jure uxoris\",\n\nHowever, in cultures which allow the ruler to have several wives (e.g., four in Islam) or official concubines (e.g., Imperial China, Ottoman Empire, Thailand, KwaZulu-Natal) these women, sometimes collectively referred to as a harem, there are often specific rules determining their relative hierarchy and a variety of titles, which may distinguish between those whose offspring can be in line for the succession or not, or specifically who is mother to the heir to the throne.\n\nTo complicate matters, the style \"His/Her (Imperial/Royal) Highness\", a prefix often accompanying the title of a dynastic prince, may be awarded/withheld separately (as a compromise or consolation prize, in some sense, e.g., Duke of Cádiz, Duchess of Windsor, Princesse de Réthy, Prince d'Orléans-Braganza).\n\nAlthough the arrangement set out above is the one that is most commonly understood, there are also different systems. Depending on country, epoch, and translation, other usages of \"prince\" are possible.\n\nForeign-language titles such as Italian \"principe\", French \"prince\", German \"Fürst\" and \"Prinz\" (non-reigning descendants of a reigning monarch), Russian \"knyaz\", etc., are usually translated as \"prince\" in English.\n\nSome princely titles are derived from those of national rulers, such as tsarevich from tsar. Other examples are (e)mirza(da), khanzada, nawabzada, sahibzada, shahzada, sultanzada (all using the Persian patronymic suffix \"-zada\", meaning \"son, descendant\"). However, some princely titles develop in unusual ways, such as adoption of a style for dynasts which is not pegged to the ruler's title, but rather continues an old tradition (e.g., \"grand duke\" in Romanov Russia or \"archduke\" in Habsburg Austria), claims dynastic succession to a lost monarchy (e.g. \"prince de Tarente\" for the La Trémoïlle heirs to the Neapolitan throne), or descends from a ruler whose princely title or sovereign status was not, \"de jure\", hereditary, but attributed to descendants as an international courtesy, (e.g., Bibesco, Poniatowski, Ypsilanti).\n\nIn some dynasties, a specific style other than prince has become customary for dynasts, such as \"fils de France\" in the House of Capet, and \"Infante\". \"Infante\" was borne by children of the monarch other than the heir apparent in all of the Iberian monarchies. Some monarchies used a specific princely title for their heirs, such as Prince of Asturias in Spain and Prince of Brazil in Portugal.\n\nSometimes a specific title is commonly used by various dynasties in a region, e.g. Mian in various of the Punjabi princely Hill States (lower Himalayan region in British India).\n\nEuropean dynasties usually awarded appanages to princes of the blood, typically attached to a feudal noble title, such as Prince of Orange in the Netherlands, Britain's royal dukes, the \"Dauphin\" in France, the Count of Flanders in Belgium, and the Count of Syracuse in Sicily. Sometimes appanage titles were princely, e.g. Prince of Achaia (Courtenay), \"prince de Condé\" (Bourbon), Prince of Carignan (Savoy), but it was the fact that their owners were of princely \"rank\" rather than that they held a princely \"title\" which was the source of their pre-eminence.\n\nFor the often specific terminology concerning an heir apparent, see Crown prince.\n\nOther princes derive their title not from dynastic membership as such, but from inheritance of a title named for a specific and historical territory. The family's possession of prerogatives or properties in that territory might be long past. Such were most of the \"princedoms\" of France's \"ancien régime\", so resented for their pretentiousness in the memoirs of Saint-Simon. These included the princedoms of Arches-Charleville, Boisbelle-Henrichemont, Chalais, Château-Regnault, Guéménée, Martigues, Mercœur, Sedan, Talmond, Tingrey, and the \"kingship\" of Yvetot, among others.\n\nA prince or princess who is the head of state of a territory that has a monarchy as a form of government is a reigning prince.\n\nThe current princely monarchies include:\n\nIn the same tradition, some self-proclaimed monarchs of so-called micronations style themselves as princes:\n\nVarious monarchies provide for different modes in which princes of the dynasty can temporarily or permanently share in the style and / or office of the monarch, e.g. as regent or viceroy.\n\nThough these offices may not be reserved legally for members of the ruling dynasty, in some traditions they are filled by dynasts, a fact which may be reflected in the style of the office, e.g. \"prince-president\" for Napoleon III as French head of state but not yet emperor, or \"prince-lieutenant\" in Luxembourg, repeatedly filled by the crown prince before the grand duke's abdication, or in form of \"consortium imperii\".\n\nSome monarchies even have a practice in which the monarch can formally abdicate in favor of his heir, and yet retain a kingly title with executive power, e.g. \"Maha Upayuvaraja\" (Sanskrit for \"Great Joint King\" in Cambodia), though sometimes also conferred on powerful regents who exercised executive powers.\n\nIn several countries of the European continent, such as France, prince can be an aristocratic title of someone having a high rank of nobility or as lord of a significant fief, but not ruling any actual territory and without any necessary link to the royal family, which makes it difficult to compare with the British system of royal princes.\n\nFrance and the Holy Roman Empire\n\nThe kings of France started to bestow the style of prince, as a title among the nobility, from the 16th century onwards. These titles were created by elevating a \"seigneurie\" to the nominal status of a principality—although prerogatives of sovereignty were never conceded in the letters patent. Princely titles self-assumed by the \"princes du sang and by the princes étrangers\" were generally tolerated by the king and used at the royal court, outside the Parlement of Paris. These titles held no official place in the hierarchy of the nobility, but were often treated as ranking just below ducal peerages, since they were often inherited (or assumed) by ducal heirs:\nThis can even occur in a monarchy within which an identical but real and substantive feudal title exists, such as \"Fürst\" in German. An example of this is:\nSpain, France and Netherlands\n\nIn other cases, such titular princedoms are created in chief of an event, such as a treaty of a victory. An example of this is:\n\nPoland and Russia\n\nIn Poland specifically, the titles of prince dated either to the times before the Union of Lublin or were granted to Polish nobles by foreign kings, as the law in Poland forbade the king from dividing nobility by granting them hereditary titles: see The Princely Houses of Poland.\nIn the Russian system, \"knyaz\", translated as \"prince\", is the highest degree of official nobility. Members of older dynasties, whose realms were eventually annexed to the Russian Empire, were also accorded the title of \"knyaz\" — sometimes after first being allowed to use the higher title of tsarevich (e.g. the Princes Gruzinsky and Sibirsky). The many surviving branches of the Rurik dynasty used the \"knyaz\" title before and after they yielded sovereignty to their kinsmen, the Grand Princes of Muscovy, who became Tsars and, under the House of Romanov, Emperors of Russia.\n\nIn each case, the title is followed (when available) by the female form and then (not always available, and obviously rarely applicable to a prince of the blood without a principality) the name of the territory associated with it, each separated by a slash. If a second title (or set) is also given, then that one is for a Prince of the blood, the first for a principality. Be aware that the absence of a separate title for a prince of the blood may not always mean no such title exists; alternatively, the existence of a word does not imply there is also a reality in the linguistic territory concerned; it may very well be used exclusively to render titles in other languages, regardless whether there is a historical link with any (which often means that linguistic tradition is adopted)\n\nEtymologically, we can discern the following traditions (some languages followed a historical link, e.g. within the Holy Roman Empire, not their language family; some even fail to follow the same logic for certain other aristocratic titles):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Hungary the title of \"prince\" has also been used as the highest title of nobility (without membership in a ruling dynasty), above the title of \"duke\", while the same usage (then as \"fürst\") has occurred in Germany and Austria but then one rank below the title of \"duke\" and above \"count\".\n\nThe above is essentially the story of European, Christian dynasties and other nobility, also 'exported' to their colonial and other overseas territories and otherwise adopted by rather westernized societies elsewhere (e.g. Haiti).\n\nApplying these essentially western concepts, and terminology, to other cultures even when they don't do so, is common but in many respects rather dubious. Different (historical, religious...) backgrounds have also begot significantly different dynastic and nobiliary systems, which are poorly represented by the 'closest' western analogy.\n\nIt therefore makes sense to treat these per civilization.\n\n\nIn ancient China, the title of prince developed from being the highest title of nobility (synonymous with duke) in the Zhou Dynasty, to five grades of princes (not counting the sons and grandsons of the emperor) by the time of the fall of the Qing Dynasty.The Chinese word for prince \"Wang\" (, literally, King) as Chinese believe the emperor \"Huang Di\" () is the ruler of all kings. The most accurate translations of the English word \"prince\" are \"Huang Zi\" (, lit. Son of the Emperor) or \"Wang Zi\" (, lit. Son of the King). \n\nIn Japan, the title \"Kōshaku\" () was used as the highest title of \"Kazoku\" ( Japanese modern nobility) before the present constitution. \"Kōshaku\", however, is more commonly translated as \"Duke\" to avoid confusion with the following royal ranks in the Imperial Household: \"Shinnō\" ( literally, Prince of the Blood); \"Naishinnō\" ( lit., Princess of the Blood in her own right); and \"Shinnōhi\" lit., Princess Consort); or \"Ō\" ( lit., Prince); \"Jyo-Ō\" ( lit., Princess (in her own right)); and \"Ōhi\" ( lit., Princess Consort). The former is the higher title of a male member of the Imperial family while the latter is the lower.\n\nIn Joseon Dynasty, the title \"Prince\" was used for the king's male-line descendant. Prince translated generally into three divisions. The king's legitimate son used title \"daegun\" (대군, 大君, literally Grand Prince). A son born of a concubine and king's great-great-grand son used title \"gun\" (군, 君, lit. Prince). But the title of \"gun\" wasn't limited to royal family. Instead, it was often granted as an honorary and non-hereditory title.\nPresently, as noble titles are no more granted or even recognized by the people, the English word \"Prince\" is usually translated as \"wangja\" (왕자, 王子, lit. king's son), only rendering the usage in foreign royal families. Princes and principalities in continental Europe are almost always confused with dukes and duchies, both being translated as \"gong\" (공, 公, lit. duke) and \"gongguk\" (공국, 公國, lit. duchy).\n\nThe title 'Prince' was used for the King's son in Sinhalese generation in Sri Lanka.\n\n\"See\" princely states for the often particular, mainly Hindu titles in former British India, including modern Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, and Nepal.\n\n\"See\" Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos\n\n\"See\" Principalia, the Sultanate of Maguindanao and the Sultanate of Sulu.\n\nIn Thailand (formerly Siam), the title of Prince was divided into three classes depending on the rank of their mothers. Those who were born of a king and had a royal mother (a queen or princess consort) are titled \"Chaofa Chai\" (: literally, \"Male Celestial Lord\"). Those born of a king and a commoner, or children of Chaofas, are tilted \"Phra Ong Chao\" (พระองค์เจ้า). The children of Phra Ong Chaos are titled \"Mom Chao\" (หม่อมเจ้า), abbreviated as M.C. (or ม.จ.).\n\nA Western model was sometimes copied by emancipated colonial regimes (e.g. Bokassa I's short-lived Central-African Empire in Napoleonic fashion). Otherwise, most of the styles for members of ruling families do not lend themselves well to English translation. Nonetheless, in general the princely style has gradually replaced the colonialist title of \"chief\", which does not particularly connote dynastic rank to Westerners, e.g. Swazi Royal Family and Zulu Royal Family. Nominally ministerial chiefly titles, such as the Yoruba \"Oloye\" and the Zulu \"InDuna\", still exist as distinct titles in kingdoms all over Africa.\n\nIn states with an element of theocracy, this can affect princehood in several ways, such as the style of the ruler (e.g. with a secondary title meaning son or servant of a named divinity), but also the mode of succession (even reincarnation and recognition).\n\nFurthermore, certain religious offices may be considered of princely rank, or imply comparable temporal rights. The Prince-Popes, Pope, Hereditary Prince-Cardinals, Cardinals, Prince-Lord Bishops, Prince Bishops, Lord Bishops, Prince-Provost, and Prince-abbots are referred to as Princes of the Church. \n\nAlso in Christianity, Jesus Christ is sometimes referred to as the \"Prince of Peace\". Other titles for Jesus Christ are \"Prince of Princes\", \"Prince of the Covenant\", \"Prince of Life\", and \"Prince of the Kings of the Earth\". Further, Satan is popularly titled the \"Prince of Darkness\"; and in the Christian faith he is also referred to as the \"Prince of this World\" and the \"Prince of the Power of the Air\". Another title for Satan, not as common today but apparently so in approximately 30 A.D. by the Pharisees of the day, was the title \"Prince of the Devils\". \"Prince of Israel\", \"Prince of the Angels\", and \"Prince of Light\" are titles given to the Archangel Michael. Some Christian churches also believe that since all Christians, like Jesus Christ, are children of God, then they too are princes and princesses of Heaven. Saint Peter, a disciple of Jesus, is also known as the Prince of the Apostles.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15453514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15453514", "title": "Ruska Roma", "text": "Ruska Roma\n\nThe Ruska Roma (), also known as Russian Gypsies () or as \"Xaladitka Roma\" (\"i.e.\" \"Roma-Soldiers\"), are the largest subgroup of Romani people in Russia and Belarus. Initially known as \"Ruska Roma\", they live mostly in Russia and Belarus, but also in Eastern and Central Ukraine, France, Canada, and the United States.\n\nThe Ruska Romani language contains some German, Polish, and Russian words, as well as a small amount of Ukrainian and Russian grammar. Most Ruska Roma are Orthodox Christians, while those living in predominantly Muslim areas (such as the Caucasus) tend to be Muslim.\n\nTheir traditional professions include horse trading, music, dancing, and fortune-telling. most Romani singers, actors, dancers, and musicians in Russia are of the Ruska Roma. Their musical culture is considered to be the leading Romani culture in Russia, and is copied by other Roma.\n\nThe Ruska Roma traditional clothing is based on Russian and Kalderash traditional clothing, and is used actively by singers and dancers.\n\nModern Ruska Roma are one of the most educated Romani groups in Russia. They have many professions.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century there already existed several Romani choruses consisting of Ruska Roma who were servants. They were considered to be so talented that their owners emancipated them. Romani choruses of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg were very popular during the 19th century. Russian noblemen sometimes married Romani chorus girls.\n\nIn Russia, Ruska Roma were mostly nomadic horse traders and singers. They traveled during the summer and stayed in cottages of Russian peasants during the winter. They paid for their lodging with money or with work on the horses. Ruska Roma were very popular among peasants who liked their music and dances and considered Roma to be beautiful.\n\nIn 1812, when Napoleon I invaded Russia, the Romani diaspora of Moscow and Saint Petersburg gave large sums of money and good horses for the Russian army. Many young Romani men took part in the war as uhlans.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century Rusko Rom Nikolai Shishkin created a Romani theater troupe. One of its plays was in the Romani language.\n\nAfter the October Revolution, some Romani families left Russia. Some young Romani men took part in the civil war.\nIn the 1920s and '30s, Roma of the Soviet Union produced a literary norm of the Romani language that was based on a dialect of Ruska Roma.\n\nRomani literature and press appeared; most of the poets, writers and journalists were from the Ruska Roma.\nIn the 1930s the Roma of the U.S.S.R. were subjected to mass repressions. Romani press and literature were forbidden.\n\nDuring World War II some of the Ruska Roma entered the army, by conscription and as volunteers. They took part in the war as soldiers, officers, infantrymen, tankmen, artillerymen, aviators, drivers, paramedics and doctors. Some teenagers, old men and adult men were also partisans. Romani actors, singers, musicians, dancers (mostly women) performed for soldiers in the front line and in hospitals. A huge number of Roma, including many of the Ruska Roma, died or were murdered in territories occupied by the enemy, in battles, and in the siege of Leningrad.\n\nAfter World War II Ruska Roma's music became very popular. Romen Theatre, Romani singers and ensembles prospered. All Roma of the U.S.S.R. began to perceive Ruska Roma's culture as the basic Romani culture. After the Decree of nomadic life interdiction (1956), the second wave of Ruska Romani settling happened.\n\nIn the 1980s, some representatives of artistic Ruska Romani families made a considerable contribution to \"informal\" music: jazz (Valentina Ponomaryova), rock (Valentina Ponomaryova, Mikhail Zhemchuzhny Junior), \"Russian chanson\" (Alexei Dulkevich Junior).\n\nIn the 1990s, Ruska Roma's music lost its popularity and now have quite a small audience, but is still popular at Russian weddings and birthday celebrations.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1013769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1013769", "title": "Systemic risk", "text": "Systemic risk\n\nIn finance, systemic risk is the risk of collapse of an entire financial system or entire market, as opposed to risk associated with any one individual entity, group or component of a system, that can be contained therein without harming the entire system. It can be defined as \"financial \"system\" instability, potentially catastrophic, caused or exacerbated by idiosyncratic events or conditions in financial intermediaries\". It refers to the risks imposed by \"interlinkages\" and \"interdependencies\" in a system or market, where the failure of a single entity or cluster of entities can cause a cascading failure, which could potentially bankrupt or bring down the entire system or market. It is also sometimes erroneously referred to as \"systematic risk\".\n\nSystemic risk has been associated with a bank run which has a cascading effect on other banks which are owed money by the first bank in trouble, causing a cascading failure. As depositors sense the ripple effects of default, and liquidity concerns cascade through money markets, a panic can spread through a market, with a sudden flight to quality, creating many sellers but few buyers for illiquid assets. These interlinkages and the potential \"clustering\" of bank runs are the issues which policy makers consider when addressing the issue of protecting a system against systemic risk. Governments and market monitoring institutions (such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and central banks) often try to put policies and rules in place with the justification of safeguarding the interests of the market as a whole, claiming that the trading participants in financial markets are entangled in a web of dependencies arising from their interlinkage. In simple English, this means that some companies are viewed as too big and too interconnected to fail. Policy makers frequently claim that they are concerned about protecting the resiliency of the system, rather than any one individual in that system. Systemic risk arises because of the interaction of market participants, and therefore can be seen as a form of endogenous risk. See also .\n\nThe risk management literature offers an alternative perspective to notions from economics and finance by distinguishing between the nature of systemic failure, its causes and effects, and the risk of its occurrence. It takes an \"operational behaviour\" approach to defining systemic risk of failure as: \"A measure of the overall probability at a current time of the system entering an operational state of systemic failure by a specified time in the future, in which the supply of financial services no longer satisfies demand according to regulatory criteria, qualified by a measure of uncertainty about the system’s future behaviour, in the absence of new mitigation efforts.\" This definition lends itself to practical risk mitigation applications, as demonstrated in recent research by a simulation of the collapse of the Icelandic financial system in circa 2008.\n\nSystemic risk should not be confused with market or price risk as the latter is specific to the item being bought or sold and the effects of market risk are isolated to the entities dealing in that specific item. This kind of risk can be mitigated by hedging an investment by entering into a mirror trade.\n\nInsurance is often easy to obtain against \"systemic risks\" because a party issuing that insurance can pocket the premiums, issue dividends to shareholders, enter insolvency proceedings if a catastrophic event ever takes place, and hide behind limited liability. Such insurance, however, is not effective for the insured entity.\n\nOne argument that was used by financial institutions to obtain special advantages in bankruptcy for derivative contracts was a claim that the market is both critical and fragile.\n\nSystemic risk can also be defined as the likelihood and degree of negative consequences to the larger body. With respect to federal financial regulation, the systemic risk of a financial institution is the likelihood and the degree that the institution's activities will negatively affect the larger economy such that unusual and extreme federal intervention would be required to ameliorate the effects.\n\nA general definition of systemic risk which is not limited by its mathematical approaches, model assumptions or focus on one institution, and which is also the first operationalizable definition of systemic risk encompassing the systemic character of financial, political, environmental, and many other risks, was put forth in 2010.\n\nThe Systemic Risk Centre at the London School of Economics is focused on the study of systemic risk. It finds that systemic risk is a form of endogenous risk, hence frustrating empirical measurements of systemic risk.\n\nAccording to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, there are two key assessments for measuring systemic risk, the \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) and the \"too interconnected to fail\" (TICTF) tests. First, the TBTF test is the traditional analysis for assessing the risk of required government intervention. TBTF can be measured in terms of an institution's size relative to the national and international marketplace, market share concentration, and competitive barriers to entry or how easily a product can be substituted. Second, the TICTF test is a measure of the likelihood and amount of medium-term net negative impact to the larger economy of an institution's failure to be able to conduct its ongoing business. The impact is measure beyond the institution's products and activities to include the economic multiplier of all other commercial activities dependent specifically on that institution. The impact is also dependent on how correlated an institution's business is with other systemic risks.\n\nToo Big to Fail: The traditional analysis for assessing the risk of required government intervention is the \"Too Big to Fail\" Test (TBTF). TBTF can be measured in terms of an institution's size relative to the national and international marketplace, market share concentration (using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index for example), and competitive barriers to entry or how easily a product can be substituted. While there are large companies in most financial marketplace segments, the national insurance marketplace is spread among thousands of companies, and the barriers to entry in a business where capital is the primary input are relatively minor. The policies of one homeowners insurer can be relatively easily substituted for another or picked up by a state residual market provider, with limits on the underwriting fluidity primarily stemming from state-by-state regulatory impediments, such as limits on pricing and capital mobility. During the recent financial crisis, the collapse of the American International Group (AIG) posed a significant systemic risk to the financial system. There are arguably either no or extremely few insurers that are TBTF in the U.S. marketplace.\n\nToo Interconnected to Fail: A more useful systemic risk measure than a traditional TBTF test is a \"Too Interconnected to Fail\" (TICTF) assessment. An intuitive TICTF analysis has been at the heart of most recent federal financial emergency relief decisions. TICTF is a measure of the likelihood and amount of medium-term net negative impact to the larger economy of an institution's failure to be able to conduct its ongoing business.\nNetwork models have been proposed as a method for quantifying the impact of interconnectedness on systemic risk.\nThe impact is measured not just on the institution's products and activities, but also the economic multiplier of all other commercial activities dependent specifically on that institution. It is also dependent on how correlated an institution's business is with other systemic risk.\n\n\"Criticisms of systemic risk measurements:\" Danielsson et al. express concerns about systemic risk measurements, such as SRISK and CoVaR, because they are based on market outcomes that happen multiple times a year, so that the probability of systemic risk as measured does not correspond to the actual systemic risk in the financial system. Systemic financial crises happen once every 43 years for a typical OECD country and measurements of systemic risk should target that probability.\n\nA financial institution represents a systemic risk if it becomes undercapitalized when the financial system as a whole is undercapitalized. In a single risk factor model, Brownlees and Engle, build a systemic risk measure named SRISK. SRISK can be interpreted as the amount of capital that needs to be injected into a financial firm as to restore a certain form of minimal capital requirement. SRISK has several nice properties: SRISK is expressed in monetary terms and is, therefore, easy to interpret. SRISK can be easily aggregated across firms to provide industry and even country specific aggregates. Last, the computation of SRISK involves variables which may be viewed on their own as risk measures, namely the size of the financial firm, the leverage (ratio of assets to market capitalization), and a measure of how the return of the firm evolves with the market (some sort of time varying conditional beta but with emphasis on the tail of the distribution). Because these three dimensions matter simultaneously in the SRISK measure, one may expect to obtain a more balanced indicator than if one had used either one of the three risk variables individually.\n\nWhereas the initial Brownlees and Engle model is tailored to the US market, the extension by Engle, Jondeau, and Rockinger allows for various factors, time varying parameters, and is therefore more adapted to the European market. One factor captures worldwide variations of financial markets, another one the variations of European markets. Then this extension allows for a country specific factor. By taking into account different factors, one captures the notion that shocks to the US or Asian markets may affect Europe but also that bad news within Europe (such as the news about a potential default of one of the countries) matters for Europe. Also, there may be country specific news that do not affect Europe nor the USA but matter for a given country. Empirically the last factor is found to be less relevant than the worldwide or European factor.\n\nSince SRISK is measured in terms of currency, the industry aggregates may also be related to Gross Domestic Product. As such one obtains a measure of domestic systemically important banks.\n\nThe SRISK Systemic Risk Indicator is computed automatically on a weekly basis and made available to the community. For the US model SRISK and other statistics may be found under the Volatility Lab of NYU Stern School website and for the European model under the Center of Risk Management (CRML) website of HEC Lausanne.\n\nA vine copula can be used to model systemic risk across a portfolio of financial assets. One methodology is to apply the Clayton Canonical Vine Copula to model asset pairs in the vine structure framework. As a Clayton copula is used, the greater the degree of asymmetric (i.e., left tail) dependence, the higher the Clayton copula parameter. Therefore, one can sum up all the Clayton Copula parameters, and the higher the sum of these parameters, the greater the impending likelihood of systemic risk. This methodology has been found to detect spikes in the US equities markets in the last four decades capturing the Oil Crisis and Energy Crisis of the 1970s, Black Monday and the Gulf War in the 1980s, the Russian Default/LTCM crisis of the 1990s, and the Technology Bubble and Lehman Default in the 2000s.\n\nOne problem when it comes to the valuation of derivatives, debt, or equity under systemic risk is that financial interconnectedness has to be modelled. One particular problem is posed by closed valuations chains, as exemplified here for four firms A, B, C, and D:\n\nFor instance, the share price of A could influence all other asset values, including itself.\n\nSituations as the one explained earlier, which are present in mature financial markets, cannot be modelled within the single-firm Merton model, but also not by its straightforward extensions to multiple firms with potentially correlated assets. To demonstrate this, consider two financial firms, formula_1, with limited liability, which both own system-exogenous assets of a value formula_2 at a maturity formula_3, and which both owe a single amount of zero coupon debt formula_4, due at time formula_5. \"System-exogenous\" here refers to the assumption, that the business asset formula_6 is not influenced by the firms in the considered financial system.\nIn the classic single firm Merton model, it now holds at maturity for the equity formula_7 and for the recovery value formula_8 of the debt, that\n\nand\n\nEquity and debt recovery value, formula_11 and formula_12, are thus uniquely and immediately determined by the value formula_6 of the exogenous business assets. Assuming that the formula_6 are, for instance, defined by a Black-Scholes dynamic (with or without correlations), risk-neutral no-arbitrage pricing of debt and equity is straightforward.\n\nConsider now again two such firms, but assume that firm 1 owns 5% of firm two's equity and 20% of its debt. Similarly, assume that firm 2 owns 3% of firm one's equity and 10% of its debt. The equilibrium price equations, or liquidation value equations, at maturity are now given by\n\nThis example demonstrates, that systemic risk in the form of financial interconnectedness can already lead to a non-trivial, non-linear equation system for the asset values if only two firms are involved.\n\nIt is known that modelling credit risk while ignoring cross-holdings of debt or equity can lead to an under-, but also an over-estimation of default probabilities. The need for proper structural models of financial interconnectedness in quantitative risk management – be it in research or practice – is therefore obvious.\n\nThe first authors to consider structural models for financial systems where each firm could own debt of any other firm were Eisenberg and Noe in 2001. In their model, no equity could be cross-owned, and debt had to be of one seniority level, only. In 2002, Suzuki published a model in which equity could be cross-owned as well. His model was developed independently of Eisenberg and Noe's. Elsinger's publication of 2009 was the first in which debt could be of different seniorities, hence allowing to model, for instance, senior and junior debt, while correctly accounting for the order of priority. His model allowed equity cross-ownership, too. With Fischer (2014), the first model which also allowed derivatives was introduced. The fact that Elsinger was unaware of Suzuki's publications, Fischer was unaware of Elsinger's, and the fact that other authors re-discovered parts of Suzuki's and Elsinger's results shows that\nthe research in this field is still somewhat unconsolidated.\n\nGenerally speaking, risk-neutral pricing in structural models of financial interconnectedness requires unique equilibrium prices at maturity in dependence of the exogenous asset price vector, which can be random.\nWhile financially interconnected systems with debt and equity cross-ownership without derivatives are fairly well understood in the sense that relatively weak conditions on the ownership structures in the form of ownership matrices are required to warrant uniquely determined price equilibria, the Fischer (2014) model needs very strong conditions on derivatives – which are defined in dependence on any other liability of the considered financial system – to be able to guarantee uniquely determined prices of all system-endogenous liabilities. Furthermore, it is known that there exist examples with no solutions at all, finitely many solutions (more than one), and infinitely many solutions. At present, it is unclear how weak conditions on derivatives can be chosen to still be able to apply risk-neutral pricing in financial networks with systemic risk. It is noteworthy, that the price indeterminacy that evolves from multiple price equilibria is fundamentally different from price indeterminacy that stems from market incompleteness.\n\nFactors that are found to support systemic risks are:\n\nRisks can be reduced in four main ways: avoidance, diversification, hedging and insurance by transferring risk. Systematic risk, also called market risk or un-diversifiable risk, is a risk of a security that cannot be reduced through diversification. Participants in the market, like hedge funds, can be the source of an increase in systemic risk and the transfer of risk to them may, paradoxically, increase the exposure to systemic risk.\n\nUntil recently, many theoretical models of finance pointed towards the stabilizing effects of a\ndiversified (i.e., dense) financial system. Nevertheless, \nsome recent work has started to\nchallenge this view, investigating conditions under which diversification may have ambiguous effects on systemic risk.\nWithin a certain range, financial interconnections serve as a\nshock-absorber (i.e., connectivity engenders robustness and risk-sharing prevails). But beyond the tipping\npoint, interconnections might serve as a shock-amplifier (i.e., connectivity engenders fragility and risk-spreading\nprevails).\n\nOne of the main reasons for regulation in the marketplace is to reduce systemic risk. However, regulation arbitrage – the transfer of commerce from a regulated sector to a less regulated or unregulated sector – brings markets a full circle and restores systemic risk. For example, the banking sector was brought under regulations in order to reduce systemic risks. Since the banks themselves could not give credit where the risk (and therefore returns) were high, it was primarily the insurance sector which took over such deals. Thus the systemic risk migrated from one sector to another and proves that regulation of only one industry cannot be the sole protection against systemic risks.\n\nIn the fields of project management and cost engineering, systemic risks include those risks that are not unique to a particular project and are not readily manageable by a project team at a given point in time. These risks may be driven by the nature of a company's project system (e.g., funding projects before the scope is defined), capabilities, or culture. They may also be driven by the level of technology in a project or the complexity of a project's scope or execution strategy.\n\nIn February 2010, international insurance economics think tank, The Geneva Association, published a 110-page analysis of the role of insurers in systemic risk.\n\nIn the report, the differing roles of insurers and banks in the global financial system and their impact on the crisis are examined (See also CEA report, \"Why Insurers Differ from Banks\"). A key conclusion of the analysis is that the core activities of insurers and reinsurers do not pose systemic risks due to the specific features of the industry:\n\nApplying the most commonly cited definition of systemic risk, that of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), to the core activities of insurers and reinsurers, the report concludes that none are systemically relevant for at least one of the following reasons:\n\nThe report underlines that supervisors and policymakers should focus on activities rather than financial institutions when introducing new regulation and that upcoming insurance regulatory regimes, such as Solvency II in the European Union, already adequately address insurance activities.\n\nHowever, during the financial crisis, a small number of quasi-banking activities conducted by insurers either caused failure or triggered significant difficulties. The report therefore identifies two activities which, when conducted on a widespread scale without proper risk control frameworks, have the potential for systemic relevance.\n\nThe industry has put forward five recommendations to address these particular activities and strengthen financial stability:\n\nSince the publication of The Geneva Association statement, in June 2010, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) issued its position statement on key financial stability issues. A key conclusion of the statement was that, \"The insurance sector is susceptible to systemic risks generated in other parts of the financial sector. For most classes of insurance, however, there is little evidence of insurance either generating or amplifying systemic risk, within the financial system itself or in the real economy.\"\n\nOther organisations such as the CEA and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America (PCI) have issued reports on the same subject.\n\nSystemic risk evaluates the likelihood and degree of negative consequences to the larger body. The term \"systemic risk\" is frequently used in recent discussions related to the economic crisis, such as the Subprime mortgage crisis. The systemic risk of a financial institution is the likelihood and the degree that the institution's activities will negatively affect the larger economy such that unusual and extreme federal intervention would be required to ameliorate the effects. The failing of financial firms in 2008 caused systemic risk to the larger economy. Chairman Barney Frank has expressed concerns regarding the vulnerability of highly leveraged financial systems to systemic risk and the US government has debated how to address financial services regulatory reform and systemic risk.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In \"Trials in Burma\" he gives special attention to the political trial of J. M.

Wealth is the status of being the beneficiary or proprietor of a large accumulation of capital and economic power. Religion is a cultural system that often involves belief in supernatural forces and may intend to provide a moral system or a meaning of life.\n\nThe GDP of countries generally correlates negatively with their religiosity, i.e. the wealthier a population is the more secular it is.\n\nAccording to a study from 2015, Christians hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by Muslims (5.0%), Hindus (3.3%), and Jews (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification Irreligion or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.\n\nA study done by the nonpartisan wealth research firm New World Wealth found that 56.2% of the 13.1 million millionaires in the world were Christians, while 6.5% were Muslims, 3.9% were Hindu, and 1.7% were Jewish; 31.7% were identified as adherents of \"other\" religions or \"not religious\".\n\nA study in the United States (based on data from 1985–1998), conducted by the sociologist Lisa A. Keister and published in the \"Social Forces\" journal, found that adherents of Judaism and Episcopalianism accumulated the most wealth, believers in Catholicism and mainline Protestants were in the middle, while conservative Protestants accumulated the least; in general, people who attend religious services accumulated more wealth than those who do not (taking into account variations of education and other factors). Keister suggested that wealth accumulation is shaped by family processes.\n\nIn the United States, 48% of Hindus have a household income of $100,000 or more, and 70% make at least $75,000, which is the highest among all religions in United States. The median net worth of people believing in Judaism is calculated at 150,890 USD, while the median net worth of conservative Protestants (including Baptists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Christian Scientists) was 26,200 USD. The overall median in the dataset was 48,200 USD.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Jewish ranked as the most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 44% of Jewish living in households with incomes of at least $100,000, followed by Hindu (36%), Episcopalians (35%), and Presbyterians (32%). Amongst Jews, in 2016, Modern Orthodox Jews had a median household income of $158,000, while Open Orthodoxy Jews had a median household income of $185,000 (compared to the American median household income of $59,000 in 2016).\n\nAccording to the same study there is correlation between education and income, about 77% of American Hindus have an undergraduate degree, followed by Jews (59%), Episcopalians (56%), and Presbyterians (47%).\n\nA study published in the \"American Journal of Sociology\" by Lisa Keister, found that \"religion affects wealth indirectly through educational attainment, fertility, and female labor force participation\" but also found some evidence of direct effects of religion on wealth attainment. Keister notes that certain religious beliefs (\"one should have many children\", \"women should not work\") lower wealth accumulation, both on the micro- and macro-scale.\n\n"}

In essence, the phrase means that all exploits during the tour must be kept strictly confidential, never to be discussed with anyone outside the group. In more recent years, the phrase has also been applied to men attending music gigs, going on business trips and fishing holidays. The term is commonly used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and the United States and is also known as \"what goes on tour stays on tour\", \"what happens on the road stays on the road\", and, among members of the United States military, speaking of temporary duty assignment, \"what happens TDY stays TDY\".\n\nThe phrase has been described by Samantha Brett, a writer for \"The Age\", as an \"unspoken male pact that for centuries can never be broken\". In essence, if you were there you may discuss the events, but if you were not there, you get nothing. In contrast, \"Rugby for Dummies\" describes the phrase as meaning that particularly funny, embarrassing, or debauched moments are for consumption only by the tourists themselves and not casual listeners back home.\n\nIt is believed that the phrase originated in 1970 during an overseas rugby union trip, and quickly cascaded into many other sporting codes such as cricket and football. The phrase has subsequently evolved into a \"code of honour\" amongst those males participating in the trip or tour. Many groups or teams travelling interstate or overseas have adopted the phrase, that mainly relates to sexual conquests and binge drinking. However, the phrase can also relate to other forms of unacceptable behaviour and etiquette.\n\nIt has been stated that there are two rules embedded in the code. Firstly, it must be a group of males in team environment, travelling away from home, where they are unconstrained from the usual forms of acceptable behaviour. The second rule is that all exploits must be kept strictly confidential, never to be discussed with anyone outside the group, particularly wives and girlfriends (also known as WAGs). \n\nThe phrase however, is not restricted to males. Australian Hockeyroo player Sarah Taylor when asked what her most memorable thing to ever happen whilst away on tour responded, \"What goes on tour stays on tour\". Anna Coogan, a writer for the \"Evening Herald\" in Ireland, stated that the code of honour also applied to women as much as men.\n\nIn the United States, the term has close connotations among touring musicians and their road crews and is expressed as \"what happens on the road, stays on the road\". American singer Mike Doughty listed the concept as number four of his \"Rules of the Road\", and the reason he wasn't going to tell stories of debauchery, drug abuse, and sexual exploits. Other musicians who have expressed the term include Jimmy Gnecco, Andrew Schwab, and Jes Steinegar of Coalesce. Author Trev Wilkins wrote in his gigging and touring guide that the concept \"is a kind of unwritten rule\", and that the professional gigger should never \"destroy the trust\" of coworkers by telling tales of their \"crazy and out-of-character\" activities. Wilkins emphasized that it was easy to ruin not only another's career but one's own, when the trust of gigging companions disappears.\n\nAmerican heavy-metal musician Tommy Lee wrote in 2005 that the phrase \"what happens on the road stays on the road\" was \"an old saying that's been said many ways\" and he expressed his view that its origin lay in rock concert touring by writing \"Las Vegas stole that shit from us...\". Lee was referring to the catch phrase \"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\", which was in common circulation before Billy Crystal used it to close the 76th Academy Awards show in 2004 and was spoken variously by people such as Laura Bush and Ben Affleck on television broadcasts.\n\n"}

Because of this, Portuguese women received the right to vote and full equality in marriage. By the early part of the 1990s, many women of Portugal became professionals, including being medical doctors and lawyers, a leap from many being merely office employees and factory workers. \n\nDuring the Estado Novo, a conservative authoritarian political regime which was in place in Portugal from 1932 to 1974, women's rights were restricted. The Concordat of 1940 between the government and the Roman Catholic Church meant that women's role was legally and socially subservient to men.\n\nAs a country where the predominant religion is Roman Catholicism, Portugal has traditionally been conservative with regards to family life. Divorce was legalized in 1975. Adultery was decriminalized in 1982. Divorce laws were overhauled in October 2008, when a new divorce law liberalized the process (see Divorce_law_by_country#Portugal).\nIn the 21st century, family dynamics have become more liberal, with cohabitation growing in popularity, and the link between fertility and marriage decreasing. In 2017, 54.9% of births were to unmarried women.\nLike most Western countries, Portugal has to deal with low fertility levels: the country has experienced a sub-replacement fertility rate since the 1980s.\n\nThe age at first marriage in 2012 was 29.9 years for women and 31.4 years for men. Cohabitants have rights under laws dealing with \"de facto\" unions in Portugal.\n\nAbortion laws in Portugal were liberalized on April 10, 2007, after the Portuguese abortion referendum, 2007. Abortion can be performed on-demand during the first ten weeks of pregnancy, and at later stages only for specific reasons (rape, risk of birth defects, risk to woman's health). However, obtaining a legal abortion is often difficult in practice, because many doctors refuse to perform abortions (which they are allowed to do under a conscientious objection clause) as Portugal remains a country where the Catholic tradition has a significant influence.\n\nThe maternal mortality rate in Portugal is 8.00 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010). This is low by global standards, but is still higher than many other Western countries. Portugal's HIV/AIDS rate is, at 0.6% of adults (aged 15-49), one of the highest in Europe. Since 2001, immigrants in Portugal are entitled to free health care, including free care during pregnancy and postnatal period, as well as use of family planning facilities, regardless of their legal immigration status - this policy is deemed important because HIV/AIDS is prevalent among some immigrant groups. \n\nThe literacy rate is still lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 94% for females (aged 15 or older, data from 2011), while for males it is 97%.\nDomestic violence is illegal in Portugal. It is specifically addressed by Article 152 of the Criminal Code of Portugal. The article, which has been amended several times throughout the years, reads: \"Whoever, whether in a repetitive manner or not, inflicts physical or mental maltreatment, including bodily punishments, deprivation of liberty and sexual abuses: a) On the spouse or ex-spouse; b) On a person of the same or another gender with whom the offender maintains or has maintained a union, even if without cohabitation; c) On a progenitor of a common descendant in first degree; or d) On a particularly helpless person by reason of age, disability, disease, pregnancy or economic dependency, who cohabitates with the offender; shall be punished (...)\". \nPortugal has also ratified the Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. Accurate data on violence against women is difficult to obtain, but according to a study published in 2008, 38% of women have experienced physical, psychological and/or sexual violence since the age of 18. \n\nTraditionally, in Portugal, as in other countries, politics was considered the domain of men. However, in recent years more women have been involved. As of 2014, there were 31.3% women in parliament.\n\n"}
