The American manufacturing economy switched from producing war-related items to consumer goods at the end of World War II, and by the end of the 1950s, one in six working Americans were employed either directly or indirectly in the automotive industry. The United States became the world's largest manufacturer of automobiles, and Henry Ford's goal of 30 years earlier—that any man with a good job should be able to afford an automobile—was achieved. A new generation of service businesses focusing on customers with their automobiles sprang up during the decade, including drive-through or drive-in restaurants and more drive-in theaters (cinemas).\n\nThe decade began with 25 million registered automobiles on the road, most of which predated World War II and were in poor condition; no automobiles or parts were produced during the war owing to rationing and restrictions. By 1950, most factories had made the transition to a consumer-based economy, and more than 8 million cars were produced that year alone. By 1958, there were more than 67 million cars registered in the United States, more than twice the number at the start of the decade.\n\nAs part of the U.S. national defenses, to support military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate highways, beginning in 1955, across many parts of the United States. The wider, multi-lane highways allowed traffic to move at faster speeds, with few or no stoplights on the way. The wide-open spaces along the highways became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.\n\nThe dawning of the Space Age and were reflected in contemporary American automotive styling. Large tailfins, flowing designs reminiscent of rockets, and radio antennas that imitated Sputnik 1 were common, owing to the efforts of design pioneers such as Harley Earl.\n\nThe Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways (commonly called the Interstate system or simply the Interstate) is a network of freeways that forms a part of the National Highway System of the United States. While serving as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II, Eisenhower had gained an appreciation of the German Autobahn network as an essential component of a national defense system, providing transport routes for military supplies and troop deployments. Construction was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, and the original portion was completed 35 years later. The system has contributed in shaping the United States into a world economic superpower and a highly industrialized nation.\n\nThe Interstate grew quickly, along with the automobile industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their social standing and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.\n\nThe United States' investment in infrastructure such as highways and bridges coincided with the increasing availability of cars more suited to the higher speeds that better roads made possible, allowing people to live beyond the confines of major cities, and instead commute to and from work.\nAfter World War II, land developers began to buy land just outside the city limits of larger cities to build mass quantities of inexpensive tract houses. One of the first examples of planned suburbanization is Levittown, Pennsylvania, which was developed by William Levitt beginning in 1951 as a suburb of Philadelphia. The promise of their own single-family home on their own land, together with a free college education and low-interest loans given to returning soldiers to purchase homes under the G.I. Bill, drove demand for new homes to an unprecedented level. Additionally, 4 million babies were born every year during the 1950s. By the end of the baby boom era in 1964, almost 77 million \"baby boomers\" had been born, fueling the need for more suburban housing, and automobiles to commute them to and from the city centers for work and shopping.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, one-third of Americans lived in the suburbs. Eleven of the United States's twelve largest cities recorded a declining population during the decade, with a consequent loss in tax revenues and city culture. Only Los Angeles, a center for the car culture, gained population. Economist Richard Porter commented that \"The automobile made suburbia possible, and the suburbs made the automobile essential.\"\n\nMore people joined the middle class in the 1950s, with more money to spend, and the availability of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them as an extension of their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.\nAs more middle-class and affluent people fled the city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629 percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20 percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.\n\nIn some instances, the automotive industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90 percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued that this was a deliberate destruction of streetcars as part of a larger strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In \"United States v. National City Lines, Inc.\", many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", \"Taken for a Ride\" and \"The End of Suburbia\".\n\nThe automobile unions played a leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.\n\nThe increasing popularity of hot rodding cars (modifying them to increase performance) is reflected in part by the creation of special-interest magazines catering to this culture. \"Hot Rod\" is the oldest such magazine, with first editor Wally Parks, and founded by Robert E. Petersen in 1948, with original publication by his Petersen Publishing Company. \"Hot Rod\" has licensed affiliation with Universal Technical Institute.\nThe relative abundance and inexpensive nature of the Ford Model T and other cars from the 1920s to 1940s helped fuel the hot rod culture that developed, which was focused on getting the most linear speed out of these older automobiles. The origin of the term \"hot rod\" is unclear, but the culture blossomed in the post-war culture of the 1950s.\n\n\"Hot Rod\" magazine's November 1950 cover announced the first hot rod to exceed 200 mph. The hand-crafted car used an Edelbrock-built Mercury flathead V8 and set the record at the Bonneville Salt Flats. This region has been called the \"Holy Grail of American Hot Rodding\", and is often used for land speed racing, a tradition that grew rapidly in the 1950s and continues today.\n\nHot rodding was about more than raw power. Kustom Kulture started in the 1950s, when artists such as Von Dutch transformed automobile pin striping from a seldom-used accent that followed the lines of the car into a freestyle art form. Von Dutch was as famous for his \"flying eyeball\" as he was for his intricate spider-web designs. As the decade began, hand-drawn pin striping was almost unheard of, but by 1958 it had become a popular method of customizing the looks of the hot rod. As the decade progressed, hot rodding became a popular hobby for a growing number of teenagers as the sport literally came to Main Street.\n\nDrag racing has existed since the first cars, but it was not until the 1950s that it started to become mainstream, beginning with Santa Ana Drags, the first drag strip in the United States. The strip was founded by C. J. \"Pappy\" Hart, Creighton Hunter and Frank Stillwell at the Orange County Airport auxiliary runway in southern California, and was operational from 1950 until June 21, 1959.\n\n\"Hot Rod\" editor Wally Parks created the National Hot Rod Association in 1951, and it is still the largest governing body in the popular sport. , there are at least 139 professional drag strips operational in the United States. One of the most powerful racing fuels ever developed is nitromethane, which dramatically debuted as a racing fuel in 1950, and continues as the primary component used in Top Fuel drag racing today.\n\nThe National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is the second most popular spectator sports in the United States behind the National Football League (NFL). It was incorporated on February 21, 1948, by Bill France, Sr. and built its roots in the 1950s. Two years later in 1950 the first asphalt \"superspeedway\", Darlington Speedway, was opened in South Carolina, and the sport saw dramatic growth during the 1950s. Because of the tremendous success of Darlington, construction began of a 2.5-mile, high-banked superspeedway near Daytona Beach, which is still in use.\n\nThe Cup Series was started in 1949, with Jim Roper winning the first series. By 2008, the most prestigious race in the series, the Daytona 500 had attracted more than 17 million television viewers. Dynasties were born in the 1950s with racers like Lee Petty (father of Richard Petty, grandfather of Kyle Petty) and Buck Baker (father of Buddy Baker).\n\nNASCAR, and stock car racing in general, has its roots in bootlegging during Prohibition. Junior Johnson was one of many bootleggers who took part in the sport during the 1950s, equally well known for his arrest in 1955 for operating his father's moonshine still as he is for his racing success. He ended up spending a year in an Ohio prison, but soon returned to the sport before retiring as a driver in 1966.\n\nAs more Americans began driving cars, entirely new categories of businesses came into being to allow them to enjoy their products and services without having to leave their cars. This includes the drive-in restaurant, and later the drive-through window. Even into the 2010s, the Sonic Drive-In restaurant chain has provided primarily drive-in service by carhop in restaurants within 43 U.S. states, serving approximately 3 million customers per day. Known for its use of carhops on roller skates, the company annually hosts a competition to determine the top skating carhop in its system.\n\nA number of other successful \"drive up\" businesses have their roots in the 1950s, including McDonald's (expanded c. 1955), which had no dine-in facilities, requiring customers to park and walk up to the window, taking their order \"to go\". Automation and the lack of dining facilities allowed McDonald's to sell burgers for 15 cents each, instead of the typical 35 cents, and people were buying them by the bagful. By 1948, they had fired their carhops, installed larger grills, reduced their menu and radically changed the industry by introducing assembly-line methods of food production, similar to the auto industry, dubbing it the \"Speedee Service System\". They redesigned their sign specifically to make it easier to see from the road, creating the now familiar yellow double-arch structure. Businessman Ray Kroc joined McDonald's as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth.\n\nOther chains were created to serve the increasingly mobile patron. Carl Karcher opened his first Carl's Jr. in 1956, and rapidly expanded, locating his restaurants near California's new freeway off-ramps. These restaurant models initially relied on the new and ubiquitous ownership of automobiles, and the willingness of patrons to dine in their automobiles. , drive-through service account for 65 percent of their profits.\n\nThe drive-in theater is a form of cinema structure consisting of a large outdoor movie screen, a projection booth, a concession stand and a large parking area for automobiles, where patrons view the movie from the comfort of their cars and listen via an electric speaker placed at each parking spot.\nAlthough drive-in movies first appeared in 1933, it was not until well after the post-war era that they became popular, enjoying their greatest success in the 1950s, reaching a peak of more than 4,000 theaters in the United States alone. Drive-in theaters have been romanticized in popular culture with the movie \"American Graffiti\" and \"Grease\" and the television series \"Happy Days\". They developed a reputation for showing B movies, typically monster or horror films, and as \"passion pits\", a place for teenagers to make out. While drive-in theaters are rarer today with only 366 remaining and no longer unique to America, they are still associated as part of the 1950s' American car culture. Drive-in movies have seen somewhat of a resurgence in popularity in the 21st century, due in part to baby boomer nostalgia.\n\nRobert Schuller started the nation's first drive-in church in 1955 in Garden Grove, California. After his regular 9:30 am service in the chapel four miles away, he would travel to the drive-in for a second Sunday service. Worshipers listened to his sermon from the comfort of their cars, using the movie theater's speaker boxes.\n\nThe first modern shopping malls were built in the 1950s, such as Bergen Mall, which was the first to use the term \"mall\" to describe the business model. Other early malls moved retailing away from the dense, commercial downtowns into the largely residential suburbs. Northgate in Seattle is credited as being the first modern mall design, with two rows of businesses facing each other and a walkway separating them. It opened in 1950. Shopper's World in Framingham, Massachusetts, was the two-story mall, and opened a year later. The design was modified again in 1954 when Northland Center in Detroit, Michigan, used a centralized design with an anchor store in the middle of the mall, ringed by other stores. This was the first mall to have the parking lot completely surrounding the shopping center, and to provide central heat and air-conditioning.\n\nIn 1956, Southdale Center opened in Edina, Minnesota, just outside Minneapolis. It was the first to combine all these modern elements, being enclosed with a two-story design, central heat and air-conditioning plus a comfortable common area. It also featured two large department stores as anchors. Most industry professionals consider Southdale Center to be the first modern regional mall.\n\nThis formula (enclosed space with stores attached, away from downtown and accessible only by automobile) became a popular way to build retail across the world. Victor Gruen, one of the pioneers in mall design, came to abhor this effect of his new design; he decried the creation of enormous \"land wasting seas of parking\" and the spread of suburban sprawl.\n\nThe 1950s jump started an industry of aftermarket add-ons for cars that continues today. The oldest aftermarket wheel company, American Racing, started in 1956 and still builds \"mag wheels\" (alloy wheels) for almost every car made. Holley introduced the first modular four-barrel carburetor, which Ford offered in the 1957 Ford Thunderbird, and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts. Edelbrock started during the Great Depression and expanded after the war. They provided a variety of high performance parts for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for setting speed records at Bonneville Salt Flats. Owners were no longer restricted to the original equipment provided by manufacturers, helping not only create the hot rod culture but also the foundation for cosmetic modifications. The creation and rapid expansion of the aftermarket made it possible for enthusiasts to personalize their automobiles.\n\nMost new cars were sold through automobile dealerships in the 1950s, but Crosley automobiles were still on sale at any number of appliance or department stores, and Allstate (a rebadged Henry J) could be ordered at any Sears and Roebuck in 1952 and 1953. By mid-decade, these outlets had vanished and the automobile dealer became the sole source of new automobiles.\n\nStarting in the mid-1950s, new car introductions in the fall once again became an anticipated event, as all dealers would reveal the models for the upcoming year each October. In this era before the popularization of computerization, the primary source of information on new models was the dealer. The idea was originally suggested in the 1930s by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression, as a way of stimulating the economy by creating demand. The idea was reintroduced by President Dwight Eisenhower for the same reasons, and this method of introducing next year's models in the preceding autumn lasted well into the 1990s.\n\nDuring the decade, many smaller manufacturers could not compete with the Big Three and either went out of business or merged. In 1954, American Motors was formed when Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in a deal worth almost $200 million, the largest corporate merger in United States history at that time.\n\nThe muscle-car era is deeply rooted in the 1950s, although there is some debate as to the exact beginning. The 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88, created in response to public interest in speed and power, is often cited as the first muscle car. It featured America's first high-compression overhead valve V8 in the smaller, lighter Oldsmobile 76/Chevy body for six-cylinder engines (as opposed to bigger Olds 98 luxury body). \"Old Cars Weekly\" claims it started with the introduction of the original Chrysler \"Firepower\" hemi V8 engine in 1951, while others such as \"Hot Rod\" magazine consider the first overhead valve engine by Chevrolet, the 265 cid V8, as the \"heir apparent to Ford flathead's position as the staple of racing\", in 1955. The \"small block Chevy\" itself developed its own subculture that exists today. Other contenders include the 1949 Oldsmobile V8 engine, the first in a long line of such powerful V8 engines, as well as the Cadillac V8 of the same year.\n\nRegardless how it is credited, the horsepower race centered around the V8 engine and the muscle-car era lasted until new smog regulations forced dramatic changes in OEM engine design in the early 1970s. This in turn opened up new opportunities for aftermarket manufacturers like Edelbrock. Each year brought larger engines and/or increases in horsepower, providing a catalyst for customers to upgrade to newer models. Automobile executives also deliberately updated the body designs yearly, in the name of \"planned obsolescence\" and added newly developed or improved features such as automatic transmissions, power steering, power brakes and cruise control, in an effort to make the previous models seem outdated and facilitate the long drive from the suburbs. Record sales made the decade arguably the \"golden era\" of automobile manufacturing.\n\nHarley Earl and Bill France Sr. popularized the saying \"Race on Sunday, sell on Monday\", a mantra still heard today in motorsports, particularly within NASCAR. During the muscle-car era, manufacturers not only sponsored the drivers, but designed stock cars specifically to compete in the fast-growing and highly popular sport.\n\nAs the automobile became more and more an extension of the individual, it was natural for this to be reflected in popular culture. America's love affair with the automobile was most evident in the music of the era.\n\n\nOther songs recorded during the decade also reflect the automobile's place in American culture, such as \"Brand New Cadillac\", Sonny Burgess's \"Thunderbird\" and Bo Diddley's \"Cadillac\". A 1955 Oldsmobile was celebrated in the nostalgic \"Ol' '55\" by Tom Waits (1973).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12582266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12582266", "title": "Abbamele", "text": "Abbamele\n\nAbbamele (also known as abbattu in Sardinian) is a honey-based product from the rural culture of Sardinia (Italy). It is also sometimes called \"abbathu\", \"abazu\" or \"honey sapa\".\n\nAccording to the traditional methods of preparation, honeycombs are crushed, and the balls of wax containing 20-30% of honey are collected in generic containers. In the days immediately after all the honey extract has settled, the remaining combs containing honey and pollen are dipped in hot water (~ 50 °C), so that the water dissolves all the honey still present in the combs. At this point, any remaining lumps of wax and pollen are broken up through the use of a suitable mixer or by hand. The remaining wax is then pressed further to squeeze out any remaining liquid and is then stored in appropriate containers. The remaining liquid from the previous step is filtered, for example with a linen cloth, at least twice, and then placed in a suitable high-capacity boiler (sometimes made of copper) where it is boiled and concentrated via decoction. During this concentration process, finely cut lemon or orange rinds are added, and any impurities on the surface of the liquid are removed. The content of the boiler becomes gradually syrupy and must be kept in constant motion to prevent the product from sticking on the bottom and developing a smokey flavour. The liquid also becomes caramelized, becoming dark like molasses but much more complex, with a toasty flavour that has hints of coffee and caramel. When the liquid assumes a consistency similar to that of honey, the heating is interrupted, and the boiler is deposited in a secluded place and allowed to cool before the abbamele is drained.\n\nThe resulting abbamele has a concentrated honey flavour, and can be eaten with cheese, for example salted or smoked Sardinian ricotta cheese, with fresh fruit, or even with pasta or vegetables.\n\n"}
{"id": "49059404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49059404", "title": "American University of Malta", "text": "American University of Malta\n\nThe American University of Malta (AUM) is a private, American-style liberal arts college in Cospicua, Malta. The establishment of the educational institution was announced in May 2015, and the project is meant to regenerate the South of Malta and give said area an economic and social boost. Since the proposal was announced, Dock 1 in Cospicua was chosen for the head campus, while extensions are being planned for other sites in Cospicua and Żonqor, Marsaskala. It was officially established on 16 September 2016, and it opened in September 2017.\n\nOn 5 May 2015, the Jordanian contracting company Sadeen Group and the Government of Malta signed an agreement at Auberge de Castille for the former to set up a private educational institution called the American University of Malta (AUM). The university was planned to be set up in Spain, but Prime Minister of Malta Joseph Muscat persuaded the chairman of Sadeen, Hani Salah, to set it up in Malta. The university is to accommodate 4000 students, primarily from the Middle East, North Africa and Europe.\n\nBy the time all campuses are complete, it is to have schools of business, architecture and design, engineering, arts, sciences, and information technology. \n\nThe original curricula of the AUM are provided by the DePaul University. The latter did not commit any financial resources for the construction of the AUM, and it was not involved in any discussions with the Government of Malta.\n\nThe proposed university is meant to create a social and economic boost to localities in the South Eastern Region of Malta, which is regarded as being less developed than the rest of the island. The project has an investment of over €115 million, and it is to create around 400 to 750 jobs. The project's estimated economic output rests at about €48 to €85 million. Ripple effects of these changes are already being felt. As of September 2016, demand for property in Cospicua has reportedly increased as a result of the university project.\n\nThe university originally planned to take in its first students in October 2016, with lectures at SmartCity Malta until the head campus was completed. The beginning of the first academic year was later moved to 28 August 2017, with lectures held at the Dock No. 1 campus in Cospicua.\n\nIn January 2016, John Ryder was named as the head of the American Institute of Malta.\n\nWhen the university project was announced in May 2015, the government offered the Sadeen Group of Outside Development Zone (ODZ) land near Żonqor Point in Marsaskala on which to build the university. A natural park, partially funded by the university, would be set up nearby. The proposal to use ODZ land raised concerns among environmentalists, including the NGOs Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, Friends of the Earth Malta, Ramblers Association, Din l-Art Ħelwa, NatureTrust Malta, Birdlife Malta, Malta Organic Agriculture Movement and Greenhouse. The Malta Developers Association also stated that a better site should be found, while the Church criticized the process used to select the land for the university. Meanwhile, residents of Marsaskala and southern Malta supported the university project by signing a petition in its favour. \n\nThe government initially planned to include the 19th-century Fort Leonardo within the university campus. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat also stated that constructing the university in Marsaskala would pressure the owners of the former Jerma Palace Hotel to redevelop the site, which has fallen into disrepair since being closed down in 2007.\n\nMuscat responded to the environmentalists' criticism by stating that the Malta Environment and Planning Authority would consider other sites as long as they are located in the southern part of the island. A public consultation process was subsequently made in order to select an alternative site for the university campus.\n\nOn 23 May 2015, the Front Ħarsien ODZ (Maltese for \"Front for the Protection of ODZ\") was set up in response to the proposed development at Żonqor Point. The group aims to protect all ODZ land in Malta, and it includes then-Labour MP, turned Democratic Party (PD) members, Marlene Farrugia, government whip Godfrey Farrugia and former Alternattiva Demokratika politician, turned Nationalist Party (PN) member, Michael Briguglio. On 20 June, the front held a protest in Valletta against the development, and it was attended by 3000 people.\n\nOn 20 August, Muscat announced that the government had reached an agreement with the Sadeen Group that the campus be split between the former Dock No. 1 in Cospicua and a reduced site at Żonqor Point. The campus at Żonqor is much smaller than the one originally planned, and it will occupy the site of the water polo pitch and of adjoining ODZ fields. This campus is to consist of three faculties and student dormitories, with a maximum height of five stories. A new water polo pitch is also to be built to replace the one that will be demolished to make way for the university. The campus at Cospicua will occupy two former warehouses at Dock No. 1 which were built during Hospitaller and British rule. Additional buildings are to be constructed, but they are to keep with the architectural style of the area. This restoration project is bringing an otherwise run down Dock no. 1 back on its feet, which had been abandoned with the end of the rule of the British. The government will rent out both campuses to Sadeen Group for around €200,000 a year. \n\nFront Ħarsien ODZ said that the proposal of splitting the campus was better than the original one, but said that it was still unacceptable to build on ODZ land. The University Students' Council also expressed its disappointment at the government building part of the campus at Żonqor Point. On the other hand, the move was welcomed by the Cospicua Heritage Society, who said that the Three Cities and Kalkara would greatly benefit from the project.\n\nThe government approved the granting of land for the AUM after a 15-hour long debate in parliament on 15 December 2015. Front Ħarsien ODZ called this parliamentary sitting \"surreal\" and said that it shows terrible governance.\n\nOn 25 August 2016, the Planning Authority approved the restoration of the British Building at Dock No. 1, and its conversion into a campus to house part of the AUM. Parts of the building which were destroyed during World War II will be rebuilt, while an intermediate level and a new second floor with a contemporary glass-and-steel design will be constructed. The renovation of the building is entrusted to the architect Edwin Mintoff, and it is expected to be completed by April 2018.\n\nThere are plans to restore the Knights' Building at Dock No. 1 and convert it into part of the campus, and this renovation is planned to be completed by 2017–18. The Marsaskala campus is to be ready by 2019–20.\n\nIn December 2015, Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil stated that since the AUM applied for the licence of a \"Higher Education Institution\", its marketing of itself as a \"University\" is illegal. In January 2016, the National Commission for Further and Higher Education announced that Sadeen Education Investment Ltd had been given a licence to operate a Higher Education Institution under the name \"American Institute of Malta\". This was the first step in the process to acquire a university licence. The commission has stated that a degree issued by the American Institute would have the same value as one issued by the University of Malta.\n\nHowever, on 11 March 2016, Sadeen Education Investment Ltd was notified by a judicial letter that licensed higher education institutions are prohibited from using the word \"university\" in their advertising and publicity, unless they have been granted that status formally. On 6 May 2016, Economy Minister Christian Cardona said that he had \"no doubt that this will be a University and not an institute. This is part of a process, but the project will result in a University\".\n\nThe National Commission for Higher Education officially accredited the AUM on 30 June 2016, after a 14-month process which included financial and academic evaluations. The commission imposed a number of conditions on the AUM, including an annual audit by the Clemson University. Sadeen asked for a compromise on these conditions, but the commission insisted that they were not negotiable. After the conditions were accepted, the commission issued a 5-year university licence on 16 September 2016.\n\nSome questions have been raised by Maltese media about whether AUM is actually American. This is especially due to the company behind the project being Jordanian. In response to this, AUM's provost John Ryder stated that the university is \"not a brand or offshoot, or run by any American university ... [but it is] American in curriculum and organisation.\" The curricula are officially provided by DePaul University, Chicago. A spokesperson for DePaul University issued a statement, qualifying the officiality of AUM’s curricula, saying that; \"Faculty designed degree programs in areas that were requested, with the dual goals of being academically well-designed and meeting regulatory requirements in Malta. Individual faculty members were selected with the help of teams -- composed of associate deans, school directors and department chairs -- in the relevant colleges. Faculty then were asked to design the curriculum, and they were compensated for their work,\" also adding; \"[t]he right to use our name (DePaul University) is specifically in connection to the curriculum. While specifics of any DePaul contract are proprietary, I can tell you that it went through the usual, internal multi-step review process.\"\n\nMuscat was accused of a lack of transparency with regards to how agreements on the AUM were made, but he responded by saying that the public was informed on the first occasion. NGOs have called for the publication of the agreement between the government and Sadeen Group.\n\nThe AUM has also generated controversy with regard to the practicality of having another university in the small country of Malta. The government stated that the AUM would end the monopoly that the University of Malta has on higher education, In response to this, lecturers at the University of Malta disagreed with the use of the term \"monopoly\", stating that the university already competes with other institutions such as MCAST. \n\nThe AUM's early phase, low student intake and initial refusals to release the official enrollment figures became flashpoints of controversy. An early promotional video presented the new university's plan to admit 1,000 students in its first year, eventually reaching a total enrollment of 4,000 students by its fourth year. The AUM officially began offering classes on Tuesday September 12, 2017, rather than Monday September 11, to avoid association with the September 11 attacks anniversary. Asked how many students the AUM admitted for the Fall semester, Provost John Ryder would only say that student recruitment was “proving to be challenging.\" In November, the Times of Malta reported that the AUM's revised plan was to enroll 330 students in its first semester, but the \"university managed to attract 15 students\" The figure was denied by university officials. Four days later, Ryder acknowledged in a Television Malta interview that the AUM student body numbered 23.\n\nAUM personnel decisions have also generated controversy, raising concerns about the legality of the new institution's employment policies and practices. Within a period of 7 months, 10 university employees were terminated, either by dismissal or resignation: (1) Deputy (Construction Project) Manager (dismissal), (2) Admissions Director (dismissal), (3) Marketing and Public Relations Director (dismissal), (4) Vice President for Administrative Affairs (dismissal), (5) IT Technician (dismissal), (6) Webmaster (resignation), (7) Admissions Counselor (resignation), (8) Human Resources Director (dismissal), (9) Professor of Finance (dismissal) and (10) Dean of Student Affairs (resignation). The dismissed deputy manager filed a judicial protest against Sadeen Education. The former admissions director sued the university for unfair dismissal. On 4 January 2018, Provost John Ryder informed the twelve remaining AUM faculty members by e-mail that their employment with the university had been terminated without cause.\n\nDespite the university's small student body, high employee turnover and growing legal troubles, Malta's Education Minister Evarist Bartolo insisted that the AUM is not a “garage operation” \n\nOther sources of controversy include allegations of legal and ethical wrongdoing by members of the AUM's board of trustees. The board members are (1) Prince Jean of Luxembourg (chair), (2) John Ryder (ex officio), (3) Taddeo Scerri (Chairman of the Board at the Bank of Valletta), (4) Hani Salah (Chief Executive Officer of Sadeen Group), (5) Taher al-Masri, (6) Derrick Gosselin and (7) Adrian Hillman (former Allied Group managing director). Hillman was appointed while under criminal investigation for laundering money and receiving kickbacks from the Maltese Prime Minister's chief of staff Keith Schembri, who has been implicated in a tax evasion scheme by the Panama Papers. Scerri was accused of ignoring conflicts of interest between his AUM board appointment and his current and past professional positions in Malta's financial sector.\n\n"}

{"id": "25325865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25325865", "title": "Bakla", "text": "Bakla\n\nIn the Philippines, a baklâ (), bayot (Cebuano) or agi (Hiligaynon) is a person who was assigned male at birth, but usually, have adopted feminine mannerisms and usually dress as women. They are often considered a third gender. Many bakla are exclusively attracted to men, but are not necessarily gay. Some self-identify as women.\n\nBakla are socially and economically integrated into Filipino society. However, some Filipinos disapprove or reject of baklas, usually on religious grounds or related social and political reasons. The stereotype of a baklâ is a \"parlorista\"–a flamboyant, camp cross-dresser who works in a beauty salon.\n\nSame-sex marriage is not recognised in the Philippines, preventing many baklâs from getting married. Legislation attempting to legalise same-sex marriage in the Philippines has been presented to Congress, but none have passed thus far.\n\nThe Philippines is predominantly Christian, with over 80% of Filipinos belonging to the Roman Catholic Church. Church doctrine officially tolerates persons with such orientations but condemns homosexual activity as \"intrinsically disordered\". This condemnation of homosexuality presents a problem for baklâ because of potential discrimination in a Catholic-dominated society. As a result, baklâ youth in particular are at a higher risk for suicide, depression and substance abuse than their heterosexual peers, with risk increasing as parental acceptance decreases.\n\nWhile a significant minority, baklâ adherents of Protestantism face varying degrees of acceptance based on the denomination to which they belong. The Philippine Independent Church, which is in full communion with the worldwide Anglican Communion, officially does not endorse homosexuality. Various Evangelical churches and the Iglesia Ni Cristo are more fundamentalist in doctrine, and thus strongly condemn homosexual acts and suppress such identities within their congregations.\n\nNon-Christian Filipinos who profess Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and other faiths also present a wide range of doctrinal views. Islam, the second largest religion in the Philippines, comprises roughly 5.57% of the population. Islam shares views with other Abrahamic Faiths in that homosexual acts are held to be sinful. According to the Delhi High Court, Hinduism does not officially condemn homosexuality. As for Buddhism, the Dalai Lama has maintained that homosexuality is \"sexual misconduct\" for Buddhist followers but does not condemn it for non-believers.\n\nIn Pre-colonial Philippines, the bakla, especially those who crossdress (\"asog\", \"bayoc\" or \"bayoquin\" in Spanish sources), were commonly shamans (\"babaylan\"), a role usually taken by women. \"Babaylan\" were highly respected members of the community who functioned as healers, keepers of oral histories, sorcerers, and as spirit mediums for communicating with ancestral and nature spirits (\"anito\").\n\nIn Cebuano, the term \"baklâ\" means \"homosexual\". In modern Filipino, it can mean either \"effeminate man\" or \"homosexual\" but the word itself has been used for centuries, albeit in different contexts. The Tagalog poet Francisco Balagtas used the word \"bacla\" in reference to \"a temporary lack of resolve\", as seen in his popular works \"Florante at Laura\" and \"Orosman at Zafira\".\n\nThey are also called bayot in Cebuano and agi in Hiligaynon/Ilonggo.\n\nIn narrating the Agony in the Garden, the traditional religious epic \"Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa\" (The History of the Passion of Jesus Christ Our Lord that Surely Shall Ignite the Heart of Whosoever Readeth), which is often chanted during Holy Week, has a passage that reads \"Si Cristo'y nabacla\" (\"Christ was confused\"). During Balagtas' time, when the Philippines was a Spanish colony, homosexual men were called \"binabae\" or \"bayogin\" like Alejandro Penunuri. Pre-World War II Tagalog meanwhile used \"baklâ\" to mean \"fearful\" or \"weakened\".\n\nBaklâ is commonly believed to be a portmanteau of the words babae, meaning woman, and lalaki, meaning man.\n\nBakla generally dress and act like women, grow their hair long, have breast implants, take hormone pills and make other changes to look more feminine. Some go so far as to undergo sex reassignment surgery, but this is uncommon.\n\nBaklâ are often considered a third gender. J. Neil C. García recalls a children's rhyme that begins by listing four distinct genders: \"girl, boy, baklâ, tomboy.\" (In the Philippines, tomboy explicitly refers to a lesbian.)\n\nNowadays, in almost every city and town in the Philippines there is at least one baklâ (in general many baklâs) living a normal life, accepted (at least by some) as a member of the third sex. This general acceptance of the baklâ sexuality does not, however, imply that they are considered equal to the other genders. García states that the ordering \"girl, boy, baklâ, tomboy\" implies \"[The differing gender's] hierarchical positioning relative to each other\". Although Filipino society is surprisingly tolerant of baklâ, there is an implied superiority of the \"traditional\" sexes over the other two.\n\nDespite this supposed \"hierarchy of the sexes,\" baklâ have become recognized and accepted by most of society; they have become an integral part it. There are successful ones, such as some \"parlorista\" who own or work at beauty salons and are considered more meticulous and detail-oriented than female peers. A few prominent social icons are also baklâ, such as television personality Boy Abunda, hairdresser and entrepreneur Ricky Reyes, actor-comedian Vice Ganda, Filipino fashion designer Michael Cinco and the world's first LGBT political party called Ladlad which means \"coming out\".\n\nIn the second edition of the now-defunct gay lifestyle magazine \"Icon Magazine\", editor Richie Villarin quoted one of the magazine's advertisers as saying \"We cannot remain oblivious to your market\".\n\nBaklâs have been instrumental in the opening of badong clubs in the Philippines and can also be found in service, retail, and both sexual and non-sexual entertainment industries. Despite their high visibility, acceptance of baklâs is limited, especially for gay professionals.\n\nBaklâ communities are renowned for beauty pageants, with Miss Gay Philippines being a national beauty pageant for baklâs. The participants model swimsuits and dresses, as in other beauty pageants worldwide.\n\nBaklâs have an argot, or secret language, called \"swardspeak\". It is used by both masculine and feminine baklâs and incorporates elements from Filipino, Philippine English and Spanish, spoken with a hyper-feminised inflection. It was widespread and popular until the 1990s, but is now considered unfashionable in most parts of Manila. It has been argued that it is more appropriate to call modern swardspeak \"gayspeak\" instead; despite being strongly identifiable as gay lingo, it is also used by heterosexuals.\n\n\n"}

It was widely used in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and the bordering areas of modern-day Croatia (southern and middle Dalmatia and Dubrovnik regions). It was particularly used by the Bosnian Church community. Its name in Serbo-Croatian is \"bosančica\" and \"bosanica\" the latter of which can be translated as \"Bosnian script\". Serbian scholars consider it as part of variant of Serbian Cyrillic because of a lot of mentions of Bosnian Cyrillic as \"Serbian letters\" or \"Serbian characters\" in sources among Catholics and Muslims in Bosnia and Southern Dalmatia. Croat scholars also call it \"Croatian script\", \"Croatian–Bosnian script\", \"Bosnian–Croat Cyrillic\", \"harvacko pismo\", \"arvatica\" or \"Western Cyrillic\". For other names of Bosnian Cyrillic, see below.\n\nThe use of Bosančica amongst Bosnians was replaced by Arebica upon the introduction of Islam in Bosnia Eyalet, first amongst the elite, then amongst the wider public. The first book in Bosančica was printed by Frančesko Micalović in 1512 in Venice.\n\nIt is hard to ascertain when the earliest features of a characteristic Bosnian type of Cyrillic script had begun to appear, but paleographers consider the Humac tablet (a tablet written in Bosnian Cyrillic) to be the first document of this type of script and is believed to date from the 10th or 11th century. Bosnian Cyrillic was used continuously until the 18th century, with sporadic usage even taking place in the 20th century.\n\nHistorically, Bosnian Cyrillic is prominent in the following areas:\n\n\nIn conclusion, main traits of Bosnian Cyrillic include:\n\n\nThe polemic about \"ethnic affiliation\" of Bosnian Cyrillic started in the 19th century, then reappeared in the mid-1990s. Without going into nuances and details, the polemic about attribution and affiliation of Bosnian Cyrillic texts seems to rest on further arguments:\n\n\nThe irony of the contemporary status of Bosnian Cyrillic is as follows: scholars are still trying to prove that Bosnian Cyrillic is ethnically their own, while simultaneously relegating the corpus of Bosnian Cyrillic written texts to the periphery of national culture. This extinct form of Cyrillic is peripheral to Croatian paleography which focuses on Glagolitic and Latin script corpora.\n\nIn 2015, a group of artists started a project called \"I write to you in Bosancica\" which involved art and graphic design students from Banja Luka, Sarajevo, Široki Brijeg, and Trebinje. Exhibitions of the submitted artworks will be held in Sarajevo, Trebinje, Široki Brijeg, Zagreb, and Belgrade. The purpose of the project was to resurrect the ancient script and show the \"common cultural past\" of all the groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first phase of the project was to reconstruct all of the ancient characters by using ancient, handwritten documents.\n\nNames used in scholarship and literature (chronological order, recent first):\n\n\n\n"}

The coronation was carried out by church officials.\n\nThe ritual of crowning a new ruler (royal enthronement) is attested in the 12th century. The coronation of Serbian monarchs took place in the most prominent of churches in the country. The coronation of the Grand Princes of Serbia was likely held at the church in Ras. The successors of Stefan Nemanja adopted Byzantine ideas on self-rule and acts on the ruler's anointment and coronation. The church official (archbishop, patriarch) anointed and crowned the ruler in the same ceremony. Through the archiereus, with the act of crowning, God's grace transits to the ruler.\n\nThe ritual of crowning a new ruler is attested in the 12th century. The coronation of Serbian monarchs took place in the most prominent of churches in the country. Stefan (r. 1196–1228), the son of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, was crowned with a crown sent by Pope Honorius III in 1217. According to Fine Jr., he was crowned by a papal legate. It is unknown where the coronation took place. J. Kalić believes that it was Peter's Church, Ras. It has been assumed that Stefan was crowned a second time by Archbishop Sava, his brother. In the second charter to the Žiča monastery dated to ca. 1224, King Stefan ordered for all future kings to be crowned at that monastery. His contemporaries and successors called him \"the First-Crowned King\".\n\nSerbia's last and only modern coronation was in 1904, when King Peter I was crowned in an Eastern Orthodox Christian ceremony at the Cathedral of the Host of Holy Archangels in Belgrade. Serbia became a part of the state of Yugoslavia after World War I, but Peter did not hold a second coronation and neither of his two successors, the Yugoslav monarchs Alexander and Peter II, were crowned. This was due to the religious diversity of the new state.\n\nStefan's crown was called \"the holy wreath\" (\"sveti venac\") by Domentijan. Later, it was called \"the god-gifted wreath of the Serbian kingdom\" (\"bogodarovani venac kraljevstva srpskog\").\n\nModern Serbian regalia were created in Paris by the famous Falise brothers jewellers in 1904 for coronation of king Peter I Karađorđević, and consisted of a royal crown, orb, sceptre, mantle, and mantle buckle. The crown, known as the \"Karađorđević Crown\", was partially made out of a cannon that Karađorđe had used during the First Serbian Uprising, and was adorned with details such as the Serbian eagle and Serbian cross. The crown, scepter, and orb were decorated with gemstones extracted in Serbia and enameled in the Serbian national colours (red, blue, and white). The mantle was made out of purple velvet, embroidered with gold and lined with ermine fur.\n\nThe sacredness of the Serbian throne is frequently stressed in medieval sources. Apart from the throne, the crown was one of the most important royal insignia in the Middle Ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For an adult, summary trials take place in a magistrates' court, while trials on indictment take place in the Crown Court. Despite the possibility of two venues for trial, almost all criminal cases, however serious, commence in the magistrates' courts.\nOffences may also be deemed 'either way', depending on the seriousness of the individual offence. This means they may be tried in either the Magistrates or Crown Court depending on the circumstances. A person may even be convicted by the Magistrates court and sent to the Crown for sentence (where the magistrates feel they do not have adequate sentencing powers). Further more, even if the Magistrates retain the jurisdiction of an offence, the defendant has the right to elect for a Crown Court trial by jury. The jury is selected independently of the prosecution and the defence.\n\nRural crime has increased in England and Wales, criminals have become more organized and more sophisticated while budget cuts have reduced the effectiveness of police response. Expensive agricultural equipment is stolen and taken out of the country or used in ram raids, also livestock is stolen. It is suspected stolen livestock is slaughtered illegally outside licensed slaughterhouses and then illegally enters the food chain.\n\nCrime in London was the highest in England and Wales in 2009 (111 per 1000 of the population), followed by Greater Manchester (101 per 1000). Crime by women in London is usually caused by poverty, drug or alcohol addiction or psychiatric illness. Other types of intervention are frequently more effective than prison at preventing women reoffending. Specialist centres can help women avoid offending or reoffending. Prison has disastrous effects on the women's children and after their release makes it harder for the women to find work and lead honest lives.\n\nThe Sheriff Court is the main criminal court; this sits locally. The procedure followed may either be solemn, where the Sheriff sits with a jury of 15; or summary, where the Sheriff sits alone. From 10 December 2007, the maximum penalty that may be imposed in summary cases is 12 months' imprisonment or a £10,000 fine, in solemn cases 5 years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine. The highest criminal court in Scotland is the High Court of Justiciary.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, magistrates' courts hear less-serious criminal cases and conduct preliminary hearings in more serious criminal cases. The Crown Court in Northern Ireland hears more serious criminal cases. These are indictable offences and \"either way\" offences which are committed for trial in the Crown Court rather than the magistrates' courts.\n\nIn England and Wales, there were 618,000 recorded \"violence against the person\" crimes which caused an injury in 2015. Other areas of crime included robbery (124,000), burglary (713,000) and vehicle theft (874,000). England and Wales has a prison population of over 80,000 (2007 estimate), equivalent to 149 people per 100,000. This is considerably less than the USA (762) but more than the Republic of Ireland (76). and a little more than the EU average (123).\n\nIn 2007–8, there were 114 homicide victims in Scotland, a slight decrease on the previous year. In the third quarter of 2009, there were a little over 17,000 full time equivalent serving police officers. There were around 375,000 crimes in 2008–9, a fall of 2% on the previous year. These included around 12,500 non-sexual violent acts, 168,000 crimes of dishonesty (housebreaking, theft and shoplifting are included in this category) and 110,000 acts of fire-raising and vandalism. In the 2008–9 period, there was a prison population in Scotland of about 7,300, equating to 142 people per 100,000 population, very similar to England and Wales.\n\nBetween April 2008 and 2009, there were just over 110,000 crimes recorded by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, an increase of 1.5% on the previous year. Northern Ireland has around 7,500 serving full-time equivalent police positions, and a prison population of 1,500, 83 per 100,000 of the population, lower than the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nRecorded crime rose 11% in the year to March 2018 while sexual offenses rose 24%, 5% of sex offenses and 3% of rape cases lead to a charge or summons. Crime detection rates are falling from 15% in 2015 to 9% recently. 75% of theft cases and 57% of robberies including muggings were closed without a suspect identified. Homicides rose 12% during the year to March 2018. Reduction in the numbers of police officers could be a factor. Police officer numbers fell to 122,404 in England and Wales, the lowest since comparable records began in 1996.\n\nIn Early Modern Britain, real crime stories were a popular form of entertainment. These stories were written about in pamphlets, broadsides, and chapbooks, such as \"The Newgate Calendar\". These real crime stories were the subject of popular gossip and discussion of the day. While only a few people may have been able to attend a trial or an execution, these stories allowed for the entertainment of such events to be extended to a much greater population. These crime stories depicted the gruesome details of criminal acts, trials and executions with the intent to \"articulate a particular set of values, inculcate a certain behavioral model and bolster a social order perceived as threatened\".\n\nThe publication of these stories was done in order for the larger population to learn from the mistakes of their fellow Englishmen. They stressed the idea of learning from others wrongdoings to the extent that they would place warnings within the epitaphs of executed criminals. For example, in the epitaph of John Smith, a highway thief and murderer, said, \"thereto remain, a Terrour to affright All wicked Men that do in Sins delight...this is the Reason, and the Cause that they May Warning take.\" The epitaph ends with the Latin phrase \"Faelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cantum” which means “fortunate the man who learns caution from the perils of others.\"\n\n\nRegional:\n\nCities:\n\n"}

It is a member of the central branch of the Tucanoan languages. Cubeo has borrowed a number of words from the Nadahup languages, and its grammar has apparently been influenced by Arawak languages. The language has been variously described as having a subject–object–verb or an object–verb–subject word order, the latter quite rare. It is sometimes called \"Pamiwa\", the ethnic group's autonym, but it is not to be confused with the Pamigua language, sometimes called Pamiwa.\n\nThere are six oral vowels and six nasal vowels. is pronounced as in \"roses.\n\nUnusually, Cubeo has a velar fricative /x/ but no strident fricative /s/.

Colombian Spanish ).\n\nThe stressed syllable is the first syllable with high tone in the phonological word (usually the second syllable of the word).

{"id": "57827358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57827358", "title": "Cyber-flashing", "text": "Cyber-flashing\n\nCyber flashing is a crime which involves sending obscene pictures to strangers through AirDrop. The term can also apply to the same action carried out entirely through Bluetooth.\n\nThe mainstream initial usage of the term occurred around the 13th August 2015, after a female commuter was AirDropped two pictures of a penis. The case was reported to the British Transport Police who indicated that as the pictures were declined insufficient data was recorded by the receiving phone to provide suitable evidence. \n\nAirDrop is a hybrid communication method of Bluetooth and Wifi. Bluetooth passes communication via use of UHF radio waves. AirDrop seeks out potential communication partners by use of Bluetooth and then uses it to establish a secure peer-to-peer \"Wifi channel\" over which the actual information is passed - usually photographs, documents and videos.\n\nAn appropriately equipped device can seek out any active peers within about 10 metres. The harassing individual can make an initial connection with any device that is open to all users. A photo can then be sent with a preview of the photo being shown to the device's owner at the same time as a request to allow connection. Therefore the harassment (The \"flashing\") can occur before a specific connection is authorised.\n\nPrevention requires reverting to the iPhone's default conditions - either turn AirDrop off or set it only to allow connections with contacts. Police forces have suggested pushing AirDrop to program an automatic reversion to this condition after a set time of configured open access. \n\nIf harassing photographs are received then keeping them allows the victim to provide a much greater set of information to cyber crime units with the police. This does cause the issue that the most effective methods of catching the cyber-flashers risks causing additional harassment and pain to the victims. \n\nFrequency of the crime has been difficult to assess with significantly stronger anecdotal evidence than indicated by crime figures. \n\nOn August 13, 2017, the \"New York Post\" reported that at least two women were sent nude pictures while commuting. A Huffington Post reporter in the UK was also sent more than a 100 sexual pictures while commuting. This case was reported to the British Transport Police and when these news stories were published a number of women indicated to the publications that they had suffered similar harassment. However UK police forces indicates very few complaints for these actions despite \"a growing awareness\" of it occurring. This indicates a wide-level of under-reporting and thus few arrests and prosecutions.\n\nIn Australia, May 2018, it was reporting that cyber-flashing was increasingly common as a prank used by children, popular due to its ease to target multiple individuals very rapidly in a fairly unidentifiable fashion.\n\nAs with other technological-based abuses, such as Deepfake pornography, revenge porn and upskirting there was no specific pre-existing law designed to criminalise and prevent cyber-flashing. This means that many police forces were and are required to fallback on more generalised crimes such as harassment and outraging public decency. \n\nIn New South Wales, Australia, The Crimes Amendment (Intimate Images) Bill 2017 was implemented to make it an offence to \"intentionally record or distribute, or threaten to record or distribute, an intimate image of a person without their consent\". This legislation would cover cyber-flashing by its prohibition on distributing intimate images without consent.\n\nIn the UK there has been criticism that \"upskirting laws\" under consideration would not cover cyber-flashing, as well as other forms of image-based abuse, such as revenge porn. The proposed laws also have a stronger intent prohibition, and it is unclear whether it would cover non-harassment circumstances as well as issues where the receiver of the images has not consented but the \"image subject\" has.\n\n"}

Wars with the Dahomey, in which the Egbas were successful partly due to the protection afforded by the Olumo Rock, led to the founding of the city of Abeokuta, which literally means \"under the rock\".\n\nThe Egba nation is made up of the following sub-divisions - the Ake, Owu, Oke Ona and Gbagura each with its own king (historically, the Egba nation is made up of four divisions; Ibara, though geographically located in Abeokuta, is part of Yewaland). During colonial rule the British recognised the Alake (or King of Ake) as the paramount ruler of the whole clan and their territory, and so, his successor is referred to as the Alake of Egbaland now. The titles of the kings of the aforementioned sub-divisions are therefore \"Alake of Egbaland\", \"Oshile of Oke Ona\",\"Agura of Gbagura\", and \"Olowu of Owu\" in order of settlement and seniority in Egba nation (the Olubara is not an Egba king; he is a Yewa king although his domain is located geographically within the present day Abeokuta). It is worthy of note that the original town and settlement of the Egba nation was under and around Olumo rock, which is in Ikija/Ikereku area of the Egba Oke Ona. The Jagunna of Itoko, is the Chief Priest of Olumo. The area in Ikija, which is Oke Ona, is only an amusement park created as an entrance to the park. The entire Olumo Rock is in the territory of, and under the control of the Itokos. Another reference name for Abeokuta by the founding fathers is Oko Adagba (Adagba's Farm or Bush) in reference to the hunter that founded / discovered Olumo rock. Adagba went hunting in search of game animal / food from the Obantoko township where his fellow Itoko citizens were stationed while wandering for a settlement. \nEgbaland was not only where Henry Townsend lived but also boasted of being the home of the first newspaper in Nigeria (\"Iwe Irohin\").

{"id": "8283285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8283285", "title": "Euthanasia in the Netherlands", "text": "Euthanasia in the Netherlands\n\nEuthanasia in the Netherlands is regulated by the \"Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act\" which was passed in 2001 and took effect in 2002. It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life. To demonstrate their compliance, the Act requires physicians to report euthanasia to a review committee.\n\nThe legal debate concerning euthanasia in the Netherlands took off with the \"Postma case\" in 1973, concerning a physician who had facilitated the death of her mother following repeated explicit requests for euthanasia. While the physician was convicted, the court's judgment set out criteria when a doctor would not be required to keep a patient alive contrary to their will. This set of criteria was formalised in the course of a number of court cases during the 1980s.\n\n\"Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act\" was passed in April 2001 and took effect on 1 April 2002. It legalises euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances. The law was proposed by Els Borst, the D66 minister of Health. The procedures codified in the law had been a convention of the Dutch medical community for over twenty years.\n\nThe law allows medical review board to suspend prosecution of doctors who performed euthanasia when each of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\nThe doctor must also report the cause of death to the municipal coroner in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Burial and Cremation Act. A regional review committee assesses whether a case of termination of life on request or assisted suicide complies with the due care criteria. Depending on its findings, the case will either be closed or, if the conditions are not met, brought to the attention of the Public Prosecutor. Finally, the legislation offers an explicit recognition of the validity of a written declaration of will of the patient regarding euthanasia (a \"euthanasia directive\"). Such declarations can be used when a patient is in a coma or otherwise unable to state if they wish to be euthanised.\n\nEuthanasia remains a criminal offense in cases not meeting the law's specific conditions, with the exception of several situations that are not subject to the restrictions of the law at all, because they are not considered euthanasia but normal medical practice:\n\nEuthanasia of children under the age of 12 remains technically illegal; however, Dr. Eduard Verhagen has documented several cases and, together with colleagues and prosecutors, has developed a protocol to be followed in those cases. Prosecutors will refrain from pressing charges if this Groningen Protocol is followed.\n\nIn 2016 the number of official cases of euthanasia in the Netherlands was 6,091 which was 4% of total deaths in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2010, the number had been 4,050, and according to research done by the Vrije Universiteit, University Medical Center Utrecht and Statistics Netherlands, and published in \"The Lancet\", that was not more than before the \"Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act\" took effect in 2002; and the study concluded that In effect, the legislation did not lead to more cases of euthanasia and assisted suicide on request.\n\nIn 2003, in the Netherlands, 1,626 cases were officially reported of euthanasia in the sense of a physician assisting the death (1.2% of all deaths). Usually the sedative sodium thiopental is intravenously administered to induce a coma. Once it is certain that the patient is in a deep coma, typically after less than a minute, pancuronium is administered to stop breathing and cause death.\n\nOfficially reported were also 148 cases of physician-assisted dying (0.14% of all deaths), usually by drinking a strong (10g) barbiturate potion. The doctor is required to be present for two reasons:\n\nIn two cases the doctor was reprimanded for not being present while the patient drank the potion. They said they had not realised that this was required.\n\nForty-one cases were reported to combine the two procedures: usually in these cases the patient drinks the potion, but this does not cause death. After a few hours, or earlier in the case of vomiting, the muscle relaxant is administered to cause death.\n\nBy far, most reported cases concerned cancer patients. Also, in most cases the procedure was applied at home.\n\nA study in 2000 found that Dutch physicians who intend to provide assistance with suicide sometimes end up administering a lethal medication themselves because of the patient's inability to take the medication or because of problems with the completion of physician-assisted suicide.\n\nIn 2010 there were 3,136 cases reported of a physician assisting the death of a patient. When categorised there were, 2,910 cases of \"end of life on request\", 182 cases of assisted suicide, and in 44 cases it was a combination. The evaluation commissions decided that in 9 cases the procedures were not according to protocol and referred the cases to the Public Prosecution Service and the Health Care Inspectorate. The number of reported cases was rising by 8% each year. In 2017, the number of reported euthanasias had increased to 6,585; 99.8% of them being performed carefully. The reason for this rise is not clear.\n\nUnder current Dutch law, euthanasia by doctors is only legal in cases of \"hopeless and unbearable\" suffering. In practice this means that it is limited to those suffering from serious medical conditions like severe pain, exhaustion or asphyxia. Sometimes, psychiatric patients that have proven to be untreatable, can get euthanasia. There is much discussion about people with early dementia who have previously stated in a written will that if they ever got dementia, they would want to get euthanasia.\n\nIn February 2010 a citizens' initiative called \"Out of Free Will\" further demanded that all Dutch people over 70 who feel tired of life should have the right to professional help in ending it. The organisation started collecting signatures in support of this proposed change in Dutch legislation. A number of prominent Dutch citizens supported the initiative, including former ministers and artists, legal scholars and physicians. However, this initiative has never been legalised.\n\nIn 2016, the Dutch Health Minister of the Second Rutte cabinet announced plans to draft a law that would allow assisted suicide in cases without a terminal illness, if the person feels they have completed life.\n\nIn 2012, United States Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum falsely claimed that forced euthanasia accounted for 5% of all deaths in the Netherlands and that elderly Dutch people wear a bracelet reading “Do not euthanize me.” This claim was mocked by various Dutch sources and prompted the Dutch embassy to respond with relevant statistics disproving Santorum's claim, but the lack of a formal statement by Dutch officials angered Dutch politician Frans Timmermans, who demanded minister of foreign affairs Uri Rosenthal to take a public stance against such assertions.\n\n"}

{"id": "53906118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53906118", "title": "International Archives for the Women's Movement", "text": "International Archives for the Women's Movement\n\nInternational Archives for the Women's Movement () was founded in Amsterdam in 1935, as a repository to collect and preserve the cultural heritage of women and make the documents of the movement available for study. The entire collection was stolen by the Nazis in 1940 and only small portions were recovered after the war. In 1988, the part of the archival collection which had not been looted by the Nazis became the foundational collection of the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement. A substantial portion of the archive was discovered in Moscow in 1992 and returned to Amsterdam in 2003. In 2013, the institution which houses the collection was renamed as the Atria Institute on Gender Equality and Women's History\n\nThe International Archives for the Women's Movement was founded in 1935 by three Dutch feminists, Rosa Manus, Johanna Naber and Willemijn Posthumus-van der Goot. Manus was a conference organizer for the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA), a secretary of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and was involved with many of the leading feminists of her day, including Aletta Jacobs and Carrie Chapman Catt. When Jacobs died in 1929, her books and papers were bequeathed to Manus. Naber was one of the founders of the IWSA and a historian dedicated to writing about the history of the women's movement, including writing biographies of prominent women. As a member of the National Dutch Women's Council , Naber had begun to collect publications on feminism and create an archive for the NVN and by 1921, had urged creation of a resource for other women to study. Posthumus-van der Goot was an economist and after she attended a 1934 conference arranged by the Dutch Association for Women's Interests and Equal Citizenship (DAWIEC) to study government policies on paid employment for women, she realized that there was inadequate information on the history of women working.\n\nThe three women's different skill-sets and ages, which constituted three-generations of the Dutch women's movement, combined to persuade the founders of the newly established International Institute of Social History (IISH) (which included Posthumus-van der Goot's husband) to give them two rooms in their building at Keizersgracht 264 for their project. On 3 December 1935, the International Archives for the Women's Movement () was founded with Manus as president and Posthumus-van der Goot as the secretary. Within a year, the official opening of the IAV was held and by 1937 they had established a multi-lingual Yearbook to confirm the international nature of collecting and studying documents about women. The international advisory board, included such members as Margery Corbett Ashby, British feminist and IWSA president from 1926-1946; Cécile Brunschvicg, French feminist, International Council of Women (ICW) member and IWSA delegate; Carrie Chapman Catt, American founder of the IWSA; Dorothy Heneker, Canadian feminist, lawyer and Secretary of the Women's International Organizations' Peace and Disarmament Committee; Bertha Lutz, Brazilian feminist and IWSA board member; Baroness Marthe Boël, Belgian feminist and president of ICW between 1936 and 1947; and Elsie Zimmern, British feminist and ICW general secretary from 1925.\n\nThe women corresponded with women's groups in English, French and German, encouraging them to forward articles, books, brochures, periodicals and the like for inclusion in the archive. They also had reciprocity agreements with other women's facilities, like the Bibliothèque Marguerite Durand in Paris and The Fawcett Library of London. By the end of the 1930s, the archive contained approximately 4500 books and brochures, as well as a collection of around 150 periodicals from twenty countries. Most of these journals were contemporary publications, though there was a complete collection of the \"Tribunes des femmes\" from 1833. Several first edition books were part of the archive, including \"A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, for the Advancement of Their True and Greatest Interest\" (1694) by Mary Astell and \"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1792) by Mary Wollstonecraft. There were original documents by Jane Austen and a manuscript copy of 's novel, \"Hilda van Suylenburg\" (1897).\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II the situation in Europe curtailed the sharing of items from the archive. The uncertainty also propelled Manus to merge her private library and documents into the IAV holdings for safety. This proved to be a costly miscalculation, as when the Nazis invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the archive became a target. By June, German officials had inspected IAV twice and on 12 July 1940 the Security Police confiscated forty boxes of materials, as well as the furnishings and fixtures. The only item which was not taken was the safe, which contained money, other valuables and some of Jacob's papers. The reasons the documents were taken has been obscured. The Germans claimed that the Berlin women's movement wanted them, which the German women later denied, though Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, head of the National Socialist Women's League did admit to having received around 500 books from IAV in 1942. Francisca de Haan a professor of gender studies at Budapest's Central European University, believes that the actual reason the archives were taken had more to do with the facts that Manus, the president was Jewish, both an international feminist and pacifist, and suspected of Communist leanings because of her left-leaning views and activities; Manus would later be executed at Ravensbrück concentration camp in 1943.\n\nThe confiscated records were initially sent to Berlin, and then later were moved to Sudetenland for security reasons. At the end of the war, the Red Army took the documents from German-occupied Czechoslovakia and in 1945-46, stored them in the KGB's (), meaning special archive, which was housed in Moscow. In 1947, Posthumus-van der Goot, the only one of the founders who survived the war, became president of the IAV and reopened the archive. She immediately began making inquiries as to what had happened to their stolen collection, following the lead that women's groups in Berlin had wanted them. , a German philosopher living in Munich wrote her that it was unlikely that any German women, except possibly Scholtz-Klink had any interest in obtaining the materials. In 1947, Dirk Graswinckel, a member of the committee to recover and repatriate Nazi plunder, returned a few boxes, representing about 1/10th of IAV's pre-war holdings. Then in 1966, a librarian from Hradec Králové, Czechoslovakia found four books stamped by the IAV and returned them. In the 1960s, the organization filed for reparations under the Wiedergutmachung program and assumed its remaining holdings were lost.\n\nThe period of actively acquiring materials ceased effectively in 1939 and through the 1970s no efforts were made to expand the collection beyond what had been retrieved, unless an individual or organization donated materials. Though some minor works were published in the 1950s and 1960s by IAV, and they moved several times, little effort was made to reach those beyond Posthumus-van der Goot's circle. In the 1970s during the Second-wave of feminism institutions and organizations began to flourish again. Women's history groups at several Dutch universities began seeking out records on women and re-discovered IAV. Growing interest in preserving women's records and specifically evaluating the history of ordinary women, led to the decision to begin acquiring documents again in the early 1980s, with the specific focus of obtaining journals, letters and diaries from working class women, instead of just women's movement elites. The Dutch government began to subsidize the collection efforts, causing the archive to exponentially expand.\n\nWanting better access to the materials, the first professional inventory was completed in 1980 and the following year, having outgrown their space, IAV moved to Keizersgracht 10 in Amsterdam, sharing offices with three other women's organizations: the Documentation Centre for the Women's Movement (), the journal \"Lover\", and the Foundation of Women in the Visual Arts (). In 1988, the IAV, IDC and \"Lover\" organizations were merged to form the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women's Movement () with the IAV archival collection underpinning the new institution's holdings.\n\nIn 1992, a report which appeared in \"NRC Handelsblad\", a major Dutch newspaper, written by historian Marc Jansen, noted that some of IAV's materials had been located in Russia. He reported that the Russians were willing to return more than thirty collections, including those of the IAV. Almost immediately the state archivists of both countries met in Moscow and signed an agreement to return the twenty-five boxes of IAV's documents found in Russia, but there were delays because the Russian Parliament refused to ratify the agreement. In 1993, Heleen Massee of the photograph division of IIAV was allowed to go to Moscow and take notes on the content of six boxes.\n\nIn the spirit of Perestroika and Glasnost policy reforms, historian Mineke Bosch and a colleague, Myriam Everard, went to Moscow in 1994 to try to discover what records were held in the Osobyi Archive. Bosch discovered a leather bound volume of newspaper clippings, photographs and translations which had been prepared by Hungarian women for a visit by Carrie Chapman Catt and Aletta Jacobs, following the 1906 Copenhagen Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. The Hungarians had invited Catt to visit in October, and advised her to bring a German-speaking companion, who was not German to assist her. To commemorate the visit, Rosika Schwimmer had helped them bind the volume marked with the inscription \"1906 October 12–14\". Upon finding the booklet, Bosch brought it to Everard and they approached the director and asked if they could return it to Amsterdam. Though sympathetic, the director denied their request, claiming that all items had to be counted before they could be returned.\n\nBosch and Everard spent four days in Moscow and inventoried 203 dossiers containing 28,051 documents, discovering hundreds of pictures dated to the 1890s. They found a large portion of Manus' documents but also noted that the collection did not represent the entirety of the stolen artifacts, as most of the 150 periodicals and all of the 4,500 books of the pre-war IAV were absent. When the delays caused concern that the IAV archives might not be returned quickly, the International Institute for Social History microfilmed 14 reels of 33,663 individual images, making the documents accessible once again. Though officials continued to press for the return of the documents bureaucracy delayed any action until an announced 2001 visit by Queen Beatrix to Russia. Finally in January 2002, twenty-two boxes of materials were returned to the Netherlands. Nine boxes, including some of the IAV records were retained because they had not been properly processed. In March 2003, the final nine boxes were sent, and rejoined the archival collection in May.\n\nIn December 2015, nine books, including \"Beroepsarbeid der gehuwde vrouw\" (Occupational work of the married woman, 1921) by Betsy Bakker-Nort were returned from the Berlin Central and Regional Library, bearing the stamp of IAV or Rosa Manus.\n\n"}
{"id": "32421158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32421158", "title": "Kkonminam", "text": "Kkonminam\n\nSince the mid-2000s, the term kkonminam (; \"kkot/n\" [꽃] = flower, \"minam\" [미남] = handsome man) has been commonly used in South Korea to refer to young men with a great sense of personal style and fashion, popularized by pop idols, who may seem effeminate, in part because they are often shown with make-up, such as eye-liner or lip gloss. Another cause may be that as most of them are in their late teens to early twenties they look rather boyish. Although they are sometimes regarded as Korean bishōnen, their gender is not commonly questioned, nor their sexual orientation.\n\nThe \"Hwarang\", or \"flower youths\"/\"flowering knights/gentlemen\" were an elite group of male warriors in Silla, an ancient Korean kingdom. Chinese sources referred only to the physical beauty of the \"Flower Boys\", known for their use of make-up and cosmetic decorations and accessories. he emergence of \"kkonminam\" is a socio-cultural phenomenon associated with the influence of Japanese bishōnen or yaoi manga that became available after the ban on the import of Japanese culture was lifted in Korea in 1998. Professor Kim Hyun Mee at Yonsei University attributes this to the growing independence and confidence of Asian women: \"[they] can afford to be more selective when choosing a mate\".\n\nThe National Security Act affected South Korea in the 1990s as there were regulations placed on international imports. Due to The National Security Act, Korea experienced a lack of television programming. This allowed television companies to turn to K-pop by establishing channels such as Mnet. Mnet is a South Korean pay television music channel which has a variety of programs through talk, game, and live music shows.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Kkonminam images became notable in the Korean entertainment industry. There came the glorification of pretty boys, with smooth, fair skin, silky hair, and a feminine manner. This replaced the previous images of tough and aggressive Korean men in television commercials, dramas, and on billboards.The kkonminam phenomenon is existent in many of Korean popular culture. It can be seen in fashion, music, photography, advertising, or television.\n\nIn 2009, \"Boys over Flowers\" a Korean television series based on a Japanese \"shojo\" manga \"Hana yori dango\" which gained much popularity in South Korea and across Asia. The series and manga is about an average high school girl who gets involved in the lives of an arrogant rich boy and his friends. In \"Boys over Flowers\", the male leads bear childlike and boyish features with contrast of muscular and strong bodies. Due to its broadcast the drama influenced South Korean Men to take their appearances more seriously. This led to an increase in South Korean males wearing cosmetics, preppy and cruise like outfits, and sporting traditionally more feminine looks, colors, and prints.\n\n= Korean Boy Pop Bands =\nCrystal S. Anderson, a Research Scholar of Cultural Studies at Longwood University, found the variety of ways of which global fans talked about masculinities of male K-pop groups. One respondent wrote, “I am also really curious about flower boys and the varying expressions of masculinity in Korean boy bands.” Another respondent noted, “The first thing that attracted me when I was small is that Korean artists are exceptionally handsome/beautiful and possessed unique style, both in their music and fashion,” linking appearance to a certain style.\n\nKorean boy bands that have appeared to adopt forms of this phenomenon are 2PM, B2ST, and MBLAQ. These Korean boy bands draw on elements of \"gangster\" and hip-hop themes in their performances. The hybridized aspects are made to appeal to other audiences and their taste based on these elemental features. Scholars that have analyzed these boys bands note that the Korean boy bands display masculinity of both kawaii and kkonminam elements.These boy bands emphasize stereotypical masculinity in their performances. \n\nDue to their display and maximization of the tough masculine image 2PM has been nicknamed by local Korean media and netizens as Jimseungdol.\n2PM, in their on-stage performances showcase total wildness and manliness. In the various end performances of \"Heartbeat\", the title song of their first full-length album, the hyper masculine beast- like performance is displayed. In the performances Taecyeon tears off his shirt off; Nichkhun rips out Taecyeon’s heart out, symbolically and in a brutal manner; while Chan-Sung breathes fiercely while lifting Nichkhun over his head.\n\n"}
{"id": "38626357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38626357", "title": "Kosovar civil society", "text": "Kosovar civil society\n\nKosovar civil society has had many incarnations since the early 1990s. It is a product of the occupation of the Kosovo province by the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia through 1999, then expanded when the Republic of Kosovo was under UNMIK and KFOR control, and now how it has evolved since the unilateral declaration of independence on February 17, 2008. It consists of the former civil society organizations from before the 1999 conflict, the local NGOs that came about post conflict, and the international NGOs that have either dispersed money or opened local branches within Kosovo.\n\nIt has a majority ethnic Albanian population, while having a minority Serbian, Roma, Ashkali, Egyptian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, and Croatian population. Prior to 2008, the government functions were administered by UNMIK and it was protected by KFOR. UNMIK and KFOR started their missions in 1999 after the NATO-led bombing of Yugoslavia and Serbian positions.\n\nThe province of Kosovo was a part of Yugoslavia since its creation in 1943. After the 1974 Yugoslavian constitution, it was made an autonomous province that had status similar to the other Yugoslavian republics without giving it full rights. This lasted until Slobodan Milošević came into power in 1988, when he changed the legal status of the province and started a campaign to purge Albanians from the government and education system. The response was the creation of parallel societies in Kosovo, one controlled from Belgrade and one created by the local Albanian population. A few of these organizations still exist, but all were focused on providing basic services, such as education and healthcare.\n\nThis period of time is characterized by a legal environment that severely restricted the amount of NGOs and their effectiveness. In addition to the legal constrictions, there were also security concerns that limited the number of NGOs.\n\nThe Mother Teresa Society was one such organization that provided health care services; The Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms collected and recorded information about human rights violations. These NGOs lasted through the war and are still active in the community to date.\n\nThis period is characterized by the increased effectiveness of NGOs due to changes in the legal and security situation in Kosovo. The focus of the NGOs was on reconstruction, of infrastructure and residences, and humanitarian aid.\n\nDirectly after the war, there was a large surge in international NGOs and money donated into the post-conflict area. After the NATO-led intervention and the signing of Regulation 1999/22 on May 9, 2000, the legal and security situation surrounding NGOs vastly improved. This allowed the international NGOs that had rushed into the country to operate with local counterparts; it also permitted the establishment and regulation of Kosovo-based NGOs.\n\nWith the 5th anniversary of Kosovo, the focus of the civil society in Kosovo has shifted from reconstruction to governance and nation building. There has also been a shift in focus towards the protection of minority rights, specifically women, Roma, and Serbs.\n\nAs Kosovo has moved past the initial reconstruction phase, there has also been a decrease in the amount of available funds and donors. It is estimated that there are only approximately 500 \"active\" NGOs, from the 4882 registered; the others have been deemed either dormant or do not have the \ncapacity to have any sort of meaningful effect on the country.\n\nThe civil society of Kosovo is generally made up of ethnic Albanians. After the NATO-led intervention, the influx of international NGOs changed the demographics of the civil society. There were a large amount of internationals from NATO member countries especially, that were based in Kosovo. Since the declaration of independence, there has been a shift to include the minorities into the process of building a democratic society.\n\nDue to the Republic of Kosovo's young population and high unemployment rates, there have been few instances of a shortage in engaging with the local population. However, NGOs cannot sustain large numbers of employees, most have between three and five employees and very few have more than 10, so while there are plenty, they are unable to provide employment for large \nportions of the population.\n\nThe civil society in the 1990s was focused on education, health care, women's rights, and the recording of human rights violations. Post-conflict Kosovo civil society was again focused on health care, women's rights, community development, and human rights; there were additional focuses on reconstruction of infrastructure and residences and humanitarian aid. Since the declaration of independence, the focus has been on the legal system, especially the judiciary and rule of law, community development, and good governance. Majority of the NGOs are focused on transparency in both the legal system and governance.\n\nKosovo recognizes two types of domestic organization, associations and foundations. Both organizations can apply for Public Beneficiary Status, though both types are still responsible for VAT, with minor exceptions.\n\nAn association is a membership organization established by at least three domestic or foreign legal or natural persons. At least one member must reside in the Republic of Kosovo.\n\nA foundation is an organization without members, whose main function is to manage property or assets. It would be created by at least one legal or natural, foreign or domestic person. It can be created by a will. There has to be at least one agent who has residence in Kosovo.\n\nThe NGOs have been the major agents of change throughout Kosovo since before the war. They were able to provide basic services during the 1990s and help UNMIK rebuild the country after the 1999 conflict. According to UNDP's Human Development Report in 2008, every fourth Kosovar family has had their life impacted by a civil society activity and that there are more people benefiting from the system than those who are participating in the system. This latter aspect is seen more with other minorities and seen least among Kosovar-Serbs, the report states; however it does mention that Kosovar Serbs answered \"don't know\" when surveyed, so there could be confusion about the benefits and if they are receiving more than they know.\n\nThe report also states that assistance with housing is the most common form of benefit, followed by infrastructure, education, and health care respectively.\n\nThe structure of the civil society has affected the impact tremendously. There are, generally, strong organizational features of the civil society of Kosovo. However, there are areas of improvement, especially in the implementation aspect. It also states that while democratization and transparency are emphasized in internal documents and memorandums, it does not consistently translate into practice.\n\nThere are only five local grant making organizations, so a vast majority of the money has been from international donors. 86% of that money comes from United States donors while the other 14% comes from the European Union. There has been little movement towards fundraising from local businesses, due to a lack of need and tax policies that do not encourage donation.\n\nSince 1999, NGOs have had to deal with a two-tiered system of government. They were regulated by the PISG and UNMIK. This has created problems, as UNMIK has been unresponsive to local level civil society activities compounded by the seeming distrust between civil society and PISG.\n\nSince 2002, the international community has been reducing the amount of money flowing into Kosovo to ensure that the PISG and NGOs would be forced to work together. However, this has not happened to a large extent. Only with international pressure does the PISG really consult with NGOs on the formation of new laws and regulations, with the notable exception of the National Action Plan for Gender Equality between politicians and women's civil society organizations. This happened over 10 weeks in 2003.\n\nNormal interactions between the government and NGOs are done through personal contacts. There are no institutional mechanisms in place to facilitate or require cooperation between the two entities.\n\nIt has been speculated that the PISG still has views of the civil society as a supportive role from the pre-war era, while also viewing NGOs as competitors for the ever-shrinking international monetary fund. The reverse is the traditional Kosovar suspicion of government authorities. This cycle has impaired the process of state building, reconstruction, and development.\n\nMajority of the funding for NGOs is project-based and generally has individual donating bodies. There is still a good amount of money that comes from UNDP, EULEX, and OSCE. UNDP focuses on projects and proposals that will affect the development of Kosovo, from infrastructure to education. EULEX focuses on projects and proposals that will increase the effectiveness of rule of law in Kosovo. OSCE works with elections and ethnic relations. They try and increase government accountability, transparency, and good governance.\n\nThink Tanks or Research Institutes: \nGrass-root Organisations:\nActivist Organisations: \nRegional: \nSpecific Funding Sources:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54496", "title": "Lawrence Lessig", "text": "Lawrence Lessig\n\nLester Lawrence Lessig III (born June 3, 1961) is an American academic, attorney, and political activist. He is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and the former director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. Lessig was a candidate for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, but withdrew before the primaries.\n\nLessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright, trademark, and radio frequency spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded Creative Commons, a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at Stanford Law School, where he founded the Center for Internet and Society, and at the University of Chicago. He is a former board member of the Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups Public Knowledge and Free Press; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nAs a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a Second Constitutional Convention. In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded political action committee which he termed Mayday PAC with the purpose of electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform. Lessig is also the co-founder of Rootstrikers, and is on the boards of MapLight and Represent.Us. He serves on the advisory boards of the \"Democracy Café\" and the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nIn August 2015, Lessig announced that he was exploring a possible candidacy for President of the United States, promising to run if his exploratory committee raised $1 million by Labor Day. After accomplishing this, on September 6, 2015, Lessig announced that he was entering the race to become a candidate for the 2016 Democratic Party's presidential nomination. Lessig has described his candidacy as a referendum on campaign finance reform and electoral reform legislation. He stated that, if elected, he would serve a full term as president with his proposed reforms as his legislative priorities. He ended his campaign in November 2015, citing rule changes from the Democratic Party that precluded him from appearing in the televised debates.\n\nLessig earned a B.A. degree in economics and a B.S. degree in management (Wharton School) from the University of Pennsylvania, an M.A. degree in philosophy from the University of Cambridge (Trinity) in England, and a J.D. degree from Yale Law School in 1989. After graduating from law school, he clerked for a year for Judge Richard Posner, at the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, Illinois, and another year for Justice Antonin Scalia at the Supreme Court.\n\nLessig started his academic career at the University of Chicago Law School, where he was professor from 1991 to 1997. As co-director of the Center for the Study of Constitutionalism in Eastern Europe there, he helped the newly-independent Republic of Georgia draft a constitution. From 1997 to 2000, he was at Harvard Law School, holding for a year the chair of Berkman Professor of Law, affiliated with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. He subsequently joined Stanford Law School, where he established the school's Center for Internet and Society.\n\nLessig returned to Harvard in July 2009 as professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. In 2013, Lessig was appointed as the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership; his chair lecture was titled \"Aaron's Laws: Law and Justice in a Digital Age.\"\n\nLessig was portrayed by Christopher Lloyd in \"The Wake Up Call\", during season 6 of \"The West Wing\".\n\nLessig has been politically liberal since studying philosophy at Cambridge in the mid-1980s. By the late 1980s, two influential conservative judges, Judge Richard Posner and Justice Antonin Scalia, selected him to serve as a law clerk, choosing him for his supposed \"brilliance\" rather than for his ideology and effectively making him the \"token liberal\" on their staffs. Posner would later call him \"the most distinguished law professor of his generation.\"\n\nLessig has emphasized in interviews that his philosophy experience at Cambridge radically changed his values and career path. Previously, he had held strong conservative or libertarian political views, desired a career in business, was a highly active member of Teenage Republicans, served as the Youth Governor for Pennsylvania through the YMCA Youth and Government program in 1978, and almost pursued a Republican political career.\n\nWhat was intended to be a year abroad at Cambridge convinced him instead to stay another two years to complete an undergraduate degree in philosophy and develop his changed political values. During this time, he also traveled in the Eastern Bloc, where he acquired a lifelong interest in Eastern European law and politics.\n\nLessig remains skeptical of government intervention but favors some regulation, calling himself \"a constitutionalist.\" On one occasion, Lessig also commended the John McCain campaign for discussing fair use rights in a letter to YouTube where it took issue with YouTube for indulging overreaching copyright claims leading to the removal of various campaign videos.\n\nIn computer science, \"code\" typically refers to the text of a computer program (the source code). In law, \"code\" can refer to the texts that constitute statutory law. In his 1999 book \"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace\", Lessig explores the ways in which code in both senses can be instruments for social control, leading to his dictum that \"Code is law.\" Lessig later updated his work in order to keep up with the prevailing views of the time and released the book as \"\" in December 2006.\n\nLessig has been a proponent of the remix culture since the early 2000s. In his 2008 book \"Remix\" he presents this as a desirable cultural practice distinct from piracy. Lessig further articulates remix Culture as intrinsic to technology and the Internet. Remix culture is therefore an amalgam of practice, creativity, \"read/write\" culture and the hybrid economy.\n\nAccording to Lessig, the problem with the remix comes when it is at odds with stringent US copyright law. He has compared this to the failure of Prohibition, both in its ineffectiveness and in its tendency to normalize criminal behavior. Instead he proposes more lenient licensing, namely Creative Commons licenses, as a remedy to maintain \"rule of law\" while combating plagiarism.\n\nOn March 28, 2004 he was elected to the FSF's board of directors. He proposed the concept of \"free culture\". He also supports free and open-source software and open spectrum. At his free culture keynote at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2002, a few minutes of his speech was about software patents, which he views as a rising threat to free software, open source software and innovation.\n\nIn March 2006, Lessig joined the board of advisors of the Digital Universe project. A few months later, Lessig gave a talk on the ethics of the Free Culture Movement at the 2006 Wikimania conference. In December 2006, his lecture \" On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code\" was one of the highlights at 23C3 \"Who can you trust?\".\n\nLessig claimed in 2009 that, because 70% of young people obtain digital information from illegal sources, the law should be changed.\n\nIn a foreword to the Freesouls book project, Lessig makes an argument in favor of amateur artists in the world of digital technologies: \"there is a different class of amateur creators that digital technologies have ... enabled, and a different kind of creativity has emerged as a consequence.\"\n\nLessig is also a well-known critic of copyright term extensions.\n\nLessig has long been known to be a supporter of net neutrality. In 2006, he testified before the US Senate that he believed Congress should ratify Michael Powell's four Internet freedoms and add a restriction to access-tiering, i.e. he does not believe content providers should be charged different amounts. The reason is that the Internet, under the neutral end-to-end design is an invaluable platform for innovation, and the economic benefit of innovation would be threatened if large corporations could purchase faster service to the detriment of newer companies with less capital. However, Lessig has supported the idea of allowing ISPs to give consumers the option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, \"Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong.\"\n\nDespite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need for legislative enforcement of copyright. He has called for limiting copyright terms for creative professionals to five years, but believes that creative professionals' work, many of them independent, would become more easily and quickly available if bureaucratic procedure were introduced to renew trademarks for up to 75 years after this five-year term.\nLessig has repeatedly taken a stance that privatization through legislation like that seen in the 1980s in the UK with British Telecommunications is not the best way to help the Internet grow. He said, \"When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place,\" \"My claim is that we should focus on the values of liberty. If there is not government to insist on those values, then who?\" \"The single unifying force should be that we govern ourselves.\"\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Lessig represented a high-profile challenge the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. Working with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Lessig led the team representing the plaintiff in \"Eldred v. Ashcroft\". The plaintiff in the case was joined by a group of publishers who frequently published work in the public domain and a large number of \"amici\" including the Free Software Foundation, the American Association of Law Libraries, the Bureau of National Affairs, and the College Art Association.\n\nIn March 2003, Lessig acknowledged severe disappointment with his Supreme Court defeat in the Eldred copyright-extension case, where he unsuccessfully tried to convince Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who had sympathies for de-regulation, to back his \"market-based\" approach to intellectual property regulation.\n\nIn August 2013, Lawrence Lessig brought suit against Liberation Music PTY Ltd., after Liberation issued a takedown notice of one of Lessig's lectures on YouTube which had used the song \"Lisztomania\" by the band Phoenix, whom Liberation Music represents. Lessig sought damages under section 512(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which holds parties liable for misrepresentations of infringement or removal of material. Lessig was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Jones Day. In February 2014, the case ended with a settlement in which Liberation Music admitted wrongdoing in issuing the takedown notice, issued an apology, and paid a confidential sum in compensation.\n\nIn October 2014, \"Killswitch\", a film featuring Lawrence Lessig, as well as Aaron Swartz, Tim Wu, and Edward Snowden received its World Premiere at the Woodstock Film Festival, where it won the award for Best Editing. In the film, Lessig frames the story of two young hacktivists, Swartz and Snowden, who symbolize the disruptive and dynamic nature of the Internet. The film reveals the emotional bond between Lessig and Swartz, and how it was Swartz (the mentee) that challenged Lessig (the mentor) to engage in the political activism that has led to Lessig's crusade for campaign finance reform.\n\nIn February 2015, \"Killswitch\" was invited to screen at the Capitol Visitor's Center in Washington DC by Congressman Alan Grayson. The event was held on the eve of the Federal Communications Commission's historic decision on Net Neutrality. Lessig, Congressman Grayson, and Free Press (organization) CEO Craig Aaron spoke about the importance of protecting net neutrality and the free and open Internet.\n\nCongressman Grayson states that Killswitch is \"One of the most honest accounts of the battle to control the Internet -- and access to information itself.\". Richard von Busack of the Metro Silicon Valley, writes of \"Killswitch\", \"Some of the most lapidary use of found footage this side of The Atomic Café\". Fred Swegles of the Orange County Register, remarks, \"Anyone who values unfettered access to online information is apt to be captivated by \"Killswitch\", a gripping and fast-paced documentary.\" Kathy Gill of GeekWire asserts that \"\"Killswitch\" is much more than a dry recitation of technical history. Director Ali Akbarzadeh, producer Jeff Horn, and writer Chris Dollar created a human centered story. A large part of that connection comes from Lessig and his relationship with Swartz.\"\n\nIn December 2016 Lawrence Lessig and Laurence Tribe established The Electors Trust under the aegis of EqualCitizens.US to provide pro bono legal counsel as well as a secure communications platform for those of the 538 members of the United States Electoral College who are regarding a vote of conscience against Donald Trump in the presidential election \n\nAt the iCommons iSummit 07, Lessig announced that he would stop focusing his attention on copyright and related matters and work on political corruption instead, as the result of a transformative conversation with Aaron Swartz, a young internet prodigy whom Lessig met through his work with Creative Commons. This new work was partially facilitated through his wiki, Lessig Wiki, which he has encouraged the public to use to document cases of corruption. Lessig criticized the revolving door phenomenon in which legislators and staffers leave office to become lobbyists and have become beholden to special interests.\n\nIn February 2008, a Facebook group formed by law professor John Palfrey encouraged him to run for Congress from California's 12th congressional district, the seat vacated by the death of U.S. Representative Tom Lantos. Later that month, after forming an \"exploratory project\", he decided not to run for the vacant seat.\n\nDespite having decided to forgo running for Congress himself, Lessig remained interested in attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption. To this end, he worked with political consultant Joe Trippi to launch a web based project called \"Change Congress\". In a press conference on March 20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress website would help provide technological tools voters could use to hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of money on politics. He is a board member of MAPLight.org, a nonprofit research group illuminating the connection between money and politics.\n\nChange Congress later became \"Fix Congress First\", and was finally named Rootstrikers. In November 2011, Lessig announced that Rootstrikers would join forces with Dylan Ratigan's \"Get Money Out\" campaign, under the umbrella of the United Republic organization. Rootstrikers subsequently came under the aegis of Demand Progress, an organization co-founded by Aaron Swartz.\n\nIn 2010, Lessig began to organize for a national Article V convention. He co-founded \"Fix Congress First!\" with Joe Trippi. In a speech in 2011, Lessig revealed that he was disappointed with Obama's performance in office, criticizing it as a \"betrayal\", and he criticized the president for using \"the (Hillary) Clinton playbook\". Lessig has called for state governments to call for a national Article V convention, including by supporting Wolf PAC, a national organization attempting to call an Article V convention to address the problem. The convention Lessig supports would be populated by a \"random proportional selection of citizens\" which he suggested would work effectively. He said \"politics is a rare sport where the amateur is better than the professional.\" He promoted this idea at a September 24–25, 2011, conference he co-chaired with the Tea Party Patriots' national coordinator, in Lessig's October 5, 2011, book, \"Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress—and a Plan to Stop It,\" and at the Occupy protest in Washington, DC. Reporter Dan Froomkin said the book offers a manifesto for the Occupy Wall Street protestors, focusing on the core problem of corruption in both political parties and their elections. An Article V convention does not dictate a solution, but Lessig would support a constitutional amendment that would allow legislatures to limit political contributions from non-citizens, including corporations, anonymous organizations, and foreign nationals, and he also supports public campaign financing and electoral college reform to establish the one person, one vote principle.\n\nThe New Hampshire Rebellion is a walk to raise awareness about corruption in politics. The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire. In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.\n\nFrom January 11 to 24, 2014, Lessig and many others, like New York activist Jeff Kurzon, marched from Dixville Notch, New Hampshire to Nashua (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling \"the systemic corruption in Washington\". Lessig chose this language over the related term \"campaign finance reform,\" commenting that \"Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic as someone who has a liquid intake problem.\" The walk was to continue the work of NH Native Doris \"Granny D\" Haddock, and in honor of deceased activist Aaron Swartz. The New Hampshire Rebellion marched 16 miles from Hampton to New Castle on the New Hampshire Seacoast. The initial location was also chosen because of its important and visible role in the quadrennial \"New Hampshire primaries\", the traditional first primary of the presidential election.\n\nLessig announced the launch of his presidential campaign on September 6, 2015.\nOn August 11, 2015, Lessig announced that he had launched an exploratory campaign for the purpose of exploring his prospects of winning the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Lessig pledged to seek the nomination if he raised $1 million by Labor Day 2015. The announcement was widely reported in national media outlets, and was timed to coincide with a media blitz by the Lessig 2016 Campaign. Lessig was interviewed in \"The New York Times\" and Bloomberg. Campaign messages and Lessig's electoral finance reform positions were circulated widely on social media. His campaign was focused on a single issue: The Citizen Equality Act, a proposal that couples campaign finance reform with other laws aimed at curbing gerrymandering and ensuring voting access. As an expression of his commitment to the proposal, Lessig initially promised to resign once the Citizen Equality Act became law and turn the presidency over to his vice president, who would then serve out the remainder of the term as a typical American president and act on a variety of issues. In October 2015, Lessig abandoned his automatic resignation plan and adopted a full policy platform for the presidency, though he did retain the passage of the Citizen Equality Act as his primary legislative objective.\n\nHe announced the end of his campaign on November 2, 2015.\n\nIn 2017, Lessig announced a movement to challenge the winner-take-all Electoral College vote allocation in the various states, called \"Equal Votes\". Lessig is counsel for plaintiffs in \"Nemanich v. Williams\", an electoral law case in Colorado.\n\nIn 2002, Lessig received the Award for the Advancement of Free Software from the Free Software Foundation (FSF). He also received the Scientific American 50 Award for having \"argued against interpretations of copyright that could stifle innovation and discourse online.\" Then, in 2006, Lessig was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn 2011, Lessig was named to the Fastcase 50, \"honoring the law's smartest, most courageous innovators, techies, visionaries, and leaders.\" Lessig was awarded honorary doctorates by the Faculty of Social Sciences at Lund University, Sweden in 2013 and by l'Université Catholique de Louvain in 2014. Lessig received the 2014 Webby Lifetime Achievement award for co-founding Creative Commons and defending net neutrality and the free and open software movement.\n\nLessig was born in Rapid City, South Dakota, the son of Patricia, who sold real estate, and Lester L. \"Jack\" Lessig, an engineer. He grew up in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn May 2005, it was revealed that Lessig had experienced sexual abuse by the director at the American Boychoir School, which he had attended as an adolescent. Lessig reached a settlement with the school in the past, under confidential terms. He revealed his experiences in the course of representing another student victim, John Hardwicke, in court. In August 2006, he succeeded in persuading the New Jersey Supreme Court to restrict the scope of immunity radically, which had protected nonprofits that failed to prevent sexual abuse from legal liability.\n\nLessig is married to Bettina Neuefeind, a German-born Harvard University colleague. The two married in 1999. He and Neuefeind have three children: Willem, Teo, and Tess.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since 2001, the president had been indirectly elected by Parliament, with a supermajority of 61 seats (three-fifths of the membership) required for election.. The voters are asked to answer the following question \"Would you agree with the Constitutional amendment, which would allow the election of the President of the Republic of Moldova by the entire population?\", voting for one of the proposed options: “Yes (for)” or “No (against)”. Of those who had cast their vote, 87.83% chose \"Yes\". However, the referendum did not pass because only 30.29% of voters turned out, short of the necessary 33% for the referendum to be considered valid.\n\nAs the constitution cannot be changed by parliamentary vote against the will of the opposition Communist Party (PCRM), which holds enough seats to block any constitutional changes by parliamentary vote, the ruling coalition decided to bypass it by holding a referendum on the question.\n\nThe new Constitution was initially adopted by the Parliament by 50+1 votes. A national referendum was then approved by a simple majority in parliament for the people to express their opinion on the new Constitution.\n\nThe proposal also changed the name of the state language from \"Moldovan\" to \"Romanian.\" According to Ghimpu, the Romanian language must be the official language of Moldova.\n\nThe Venice Commission of the Council of Europe reacted initially favorably to a proposed constitutional reform, in particular to revise the existing procedure of electing president of the republic. However, after a plenary meeting in March 2010, the Commission suggested to hold early parliamentary elections instead of conducting a constitutional referendum. The Commission also stressed that the current parliament should be dissolved after adopting the proposal for constitutional reform and that this proposal should take effect for the next parliament.\n\nOn 9 March 2010, the four leaders of the Alliance for European Integration (AEI) decided to organize the referendum before June 16, 2010 in order to adopt the 2010 constitution. Ghimpu stated that he was not going to dissolve the Parliament in case of defeat on September 2010.\n\nThe opposition Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) suggested to lower the validity threshold for future presidential elections from 61 to 51, a simple majority. However, the communists insisted that this change would be in force only after the next parliamentary elections, whereas the ruling coalition wanted to introduce the changes before such elections. After negotiations with the communists have failed, the AEI used its simple majority advantage in the parliament on 7 July 2010 to pass the referendum proposal. In addition, the electoral code was amended by lowering the necessary voter turnout from 60% to 33%, reducing the effectiveness of a boycott\n\nThe PCRM together with several other parties urged the voters to boycott the referendum, hoping to push the turnout below the 33% necessary for validation of the referendum’s result.\n\nMoldovan citizens living abroad were allowed to participate in the referendum. The deputy prime minister, Iurie Leancă, said that 130,000 ballot papers were requested for the 78 polling stations which opened abroad, 1,600 for each of them.\n\nAccording to the Chişinău-based Institute of Marketing and Polls IMAS-INC, a poll held between July 26 and August 12 showed that 91% of the people will vote \"yes\" (for) and that about 73% of Moldova's population was ready to take part in the referendum.\n\nPolitical parties were not registered as electoral contestants in the referendum, but they could register as participants in the referendum, with the Central Election Commission of Moldova having required them to declare their position via two options: “yes (for)” or “no (against)”.\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\"The Council of Europe and a European Union delegation financed 20 teams of observers on behalf of NGOs from Moldova, which went abroad. At the same time, the Council of Europe and the EU sent at least 20 observers to monitor the holding of the referendum in the country,\" Iurie Leancă said.\n\nThe head of the observer mission from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Andreas Gross, praised the referendum as being well organised and corresponding to democratic standards.\n\nPrime Minister Vlad Filat suggested that the referendum's failure was due not only to the boycott called by the Communists, but also to splits within the governing alliance.\n\nAfter the referendum failed to meet the 33% turnout required to validate the results, the Alliance for European Integration announced that it would consult the Constitutional Court of Moldova on dissolving parliament and holding new elections. After the Constitutional court has confirmed the need for new elections, these were scheduled for 28 November 2010.\n\n\n"}

He operated in Virginia and the Carolinas before the war, and in Kentucky and Illinois afterward. He was associated with Cave-in-Rock and his son, outlaw Peter Alston, and counterfeiter John Duff. He was an early American settler in Natchez, as well as in the Cumberland and Red River valleys in Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nPhilip Alston was born Feb. 18, 1740 or 1741, the son of Solomon Alston and Sarah Ann \"Nancy\" Hinton. He had at least one brother named John. Alston was probably born in the British Royal colony of the Province of South Carolina, where the Alston family first settled in North America. The Alston surname was very common in this colony. His family moved to the Province of North Carolina when he was quite young. \n\nAlston was believed to have married in 1765 in North Carolina to a woman named either Temperance Smith, granddaughter of Captain Nicholas Smith and great-great granddaughter of Robert Bell, or Mary Molly Temple. He may have married again to Mildred McCoy, after whom his second son received his middle name.\n\nPhilip Alston and his wife were known to have had five surviving children:\n\n\nIt is not known when the senior Philip Alston learned and started counterfeiting. In 1770–1771 he and his brother John Alston were wanted by the law for counterfeiting activities in North Carolina and in 1773 in the colony of Virginia. As authorities were targeting counterfeiters in North Carolina, as well as the neighboring colonies of Virginia and South Carolina, the Alston brothers fled in 1772 or 1773 to Natchez, British West Florida, on the Mississippi River. This former French colonial city was located about 200 miles upriver from New Orleans.\n\n \nUpon arriving in the Natchez District of British West Florida, in 1772 or 1773, Alston became \"a prosperous land speculator and wealthy planter, and, in 1776, possessed some of the finest palatial mansions in that gay city.\" On April 22, 1781, under the overall leadership of John Blommart, Alston, his brother John, and other pro-British Loyalist settlers formed the \"Natchez Volunteers\". Along with allied Choctaw Indians, they led an uprising in 1783 against Spanish authorities, who officially took possession of British territory in this area of North America that year, under the Treaty of Paris. Soon after they captured Fort Panmure, the rebels split into pro-American and pro-British factions. Alston, his brother, and John Turner wanted to execute the Spanish garrison and raise the American flag. Led by Blommart and Thomas Hutchins, the other side won the argument and sent the garrison away. \n\nMeanwhile, Spanish forces defeated a British attack on Pensacola, which had been intended to relieve the settlers at Natchez. On June 23, 1783, Spanish soldiers retook Fort Panmure without firing a shot, capturing Blommart and John Alston. Other leaders had fled, Hutchins to the Carolinas and Philip Alston to the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee, where he had already established a second home. Before fleeing Natchez, Alston was reported to have stolen a crucifix from the Catholic Church. Alston is referred to in Spanish records as Phelipe Alston.\n\nOn May 13, 1780, Philip Alston was a signatory, with other settlers, on the Cumberland Compact, a forerunner of the Tennessee State Constitution, at Fort Nashborough, Virginia (now Nashville, Tennessee). This was the first governing document for settlers of the Cumberland Valley. Alston may have been living at Mansker's Station, now Goodlettsville, Tennessee.\n\nFollowing his escape from New Madrid, Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory, Philip Alston and John Turner joined James Logan Colbert, a Chickasaw leader, and a mixed, roving band of Natchez refugees, Cumberland settlers, and Chickasaw. These numbered about 600 men who were river pirates attacking Spanish shipping on the Mississippi River in 1781 and 1782. The \"Pennsylvania Gazette\", a colonial newspaper, in Philadelphia, reprinted a letter in the fall of 1783 that said Alston was the \"famous money counterfeiter\" and a leader of the band raiding Spanish shipping on the Mississippi.\n\nAround 1783 or, at least, by the summer of 1784, Alston moved northwest from Natchez. He settled in what is now Logan County, Kentucky, in the western part of the state, where he built Alston's Station, or fort, near the Red River. It was downstream of the mouth of the Big Whippoorwill. He farmed in the summer of 1784 and manufactured salt at Moate's Lick that autumn, assisted by old John Stuart. \"He traded his salt for skins and then traded the skins off at Natchez or the Eastern States for goods, and he also, became the first merchant. Shortly afterwards, he and James Dromgoole did business together\". In 1795, the settlers around Alston's Station included Jesse and William Green, Dromgoole (also spelled Drumgole), and Stuart and Matthew McClean.\n\nAlexander Finley, in his book \"The History of Russellville and Logan County, Ky\" (1876), described Alston and his activities: \"He fled from Natchez to Kentucky and settled in Logan County, where he established a salt works and store at Moat's Lick. While running these he managed the Cedar House, a tavern near Russellville. He also farmed, preached, and taught school, and incidentally \"flooded the country with spurious money.\" Thus he became, not only the first farmer, manufacturer, and exchange, but he established the first depot of exchange and the first bank, and also the first mint in western Kentucky.\"\n\nIn 1786, Alston began counterfeiting again. Alston and Drumgole celebrated Independence Day that year by stealing his former slave King, who had been sold by Spanish authorities from Alston's estate after he fled Natchez earlier in the decade. Spanish records from Natchez listed Alston as the \"robber\".\n\nAlston got into trouble for counterfeiting in Logan County, Kentucky, and was banished. In 1789, he moved to the area of Alston's Creek, in northern Logan County but, did not remain there long. Fearing for his safety, Alston moved around often over the next two years. First, he went to Alston's Lick, now in Muhlenberg County, and shortly thereafter, to Livingston County and finally, to Henderson County, all in western Kentucky. In 1790 he crossed the Ohio River to the north into Illinois.\n\nIn 1790, Alston was at Cave-in-Rock, Illinois, then a part of Knox County, Northwest Territory, with Duff. Finley wrote that Alston became a \"fast friend and disciple of the notorious counterfeiter, Sturdevant\". But historian Otto A. Rothert said that Roswell or \"Bloody Jack\" Sturdivant did not arrive at Cave-in-Rock for at least another generation. \"Duff the Counterfeiter\", considered notorious during the 1790s, is believed to be the same man who was associated with Alston. According to Finley, Alston soon moved back to Tennessee and from there to Natchez, picking up with former associates. \n\nAlston was appointed as an empresario in New Madrid, by the governor of the Spanish Louisiana Territory. He was responsible for administering land grants and recruiting new settlers. He died there. \n\nIn 1790, Alston was working with James O'Fallon in the Yazoo land scandal, which was intended to settle Americans in southern Mississippi, who would have been aligned with the Spanish. On September 16, 1790, O'Fallon had organized the Yazoo Battalion, a militia to secure the land. Both Alston and Drumgold (Drumgoole) were listed as captains, and John Alston, Philip's brother, was a lieutenant of infantry riflemen.\n\nAlston fades out of American records in the 1790s. On January 22, 1793, he sold goods to his son-in-law, John Gilbert in Logan County, Kentucky. He was recorded in county records on October 22, 1799, to prove another deed involving Gilbert. One account notes that Alston and his son, Peter conducted their counterfeiting operation at Stack Island, in the lower Mississippi River valley about 170 miles upriver from Natchez. This would have been around 1799, at the same time that river pirates were operating from there under the leadership of Samuel Mason, who had been at Cave-in-Rock.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25144466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25144466", "title": "Pkharmat", "text": "Pkharmat\n\nPkharmat (, Creator of the nation, language or land) is a legendary hero of the Vainakh people who brought fire to mankind and was chained to the Mount Kazbek. This allowed them to forge metal, cook and illuminate their houses. As a result of this, the people united and became a nation. Pkharmat is the Vainakh equivalent of the Greek hero Prometheus and the Georgian mythology hero Amirani, among others.\n\nPkharmat was a demi-god, or Nart, who loved and pitied his people, for they had no fire. The fire was kept by the cruel god Sela in his realm to show the Narts his strength and power and to suppress them. Sela, the god of the stars, thunder and lightning, drove his fire-chariot about the heavens and criss-crossed the Sky, making a terrible noise. With his bow he fired bolts of lightning down to earth.\n\nBecause they had no fire, Narts ate raw food and cold milk, and had no agriculture. For a long time the Narts led a miserable life. Sela knew it and was glad to see them so miserable as all the other gods were except Sela's wife \"Sata\". Sata cared for Narts, but she was afraid of her husband.\n\nOne day, there appeared a brave hero, Pkharmat. Pkharmat knew of the fire in hell () on the top of Mount Bashlam, thought to be a volcano. One day he decided to steal it. He forged without heat for his journey a coat, a sword and a shield out of Bronze. He mounted his horse \"Turpal\" and began his journey.\n\nSata took bird's form and alighted upon the mount's summit. She spoke to Pkharmat with a human voice: \"O powerful Nart, you have not reached the summit of Bashlam by chance. You have come to fetch Fire.\" Pkharmat answered \"The people are in need of heat, of light. I shall only return to Earth to bring back Fire!\". Having seen how strong the Nart and his horse were, Sata promised to help him in his quest for Fire. She advised him how to go about obtaining some, and warned him of the possible danger and of Sela's cruelty.\n\nPkharmat also received help from his older brother, who Pkharmat informed of his quest. He gave his dear younger brother the \"carz\", a reed-like plant with a soft-inner core, with a piece of coal in it. The coal was very much attracted to the fire, and it burned, and with its sparks boring into the \"carz\", eventually boring eight holes of different length. Finally, the \"carz\" had been made into the reedpipe, which could make music, formerly unknown to the Narts. It was eventually given to the Narts.\n\nPkharmat leaped over hell and seized a burning piece of wood. Sela was angered that a Nart acted against his will and tried to catch him. Because he was unable to reach him, he untied his skein in which he kept night. Pkharmat quickly lost his way in the darkness, but \"Sata\" came to help, guiding him in bird form. Sela saw Pkharmat escaping and untied two skeins in which he kept storm and terrible cold. Pkharmat overcome these difficulties and struggled to the great cave in all Narts were gathered together for protection from cold, storm and darkness. He gave them the fire and told \"Here is Fire for you! Multiply and become a great tribe. Warm yourselves; illuminate your homes, the caves, the towers; cook, prepare food from now on. Rejoice!\"\n\nAfter that Sela sent his servant cyclops \"Uja\" to punish the unfaithful Pkharmat. \"Uja\" chained Pkharmat to the peak of Mount Bashlam with chains of bronze. The falcon \"Ida\" comes to Pkharmat every morning. According to the will of Sela, it sits upon Pkharmat's knees and tears at his liver with his beak.\n\n\"Turpal\" was a legendary horse capable of outrunning lightning, which always roamed free, grazing among seven mountains, and drinking sea-water. Pkharmat wanted Turpal as his horse. Not even Sela's lightning bolts allowed Pkharmat to catch Turpal, which forced him to untie his skeins. Another miracle of \"Turpal\"'s miracles was leaping over burning hell on Bashlam's peak when Pkharmat took fire. \"Turpal\" means \"Hero\" in Nakh languages and is used as a male name.\n\nBashlam is known to most of the world as Mount Kazbek. Nowadays frozen Mount Bashlam is the place on top of which Sela's burning hell was placed. Bashlam is a dormant stratovolcano and one of the chief mountains of the Caucasus located in Georgia. Bashlam's last eruption was circa 750 BC. Events occurring in the legend may be memories of the chaos reigned in those days. Bashlam is the Nakh name of the Mount Kazbek, translated as Molten Mount. Bashlam has always been a sacred site for the Nakh and home of the Akkhi and Nart-Orsxtoi Tukkhums.\n\nPkharmat is usually identified as the Vainakh equivalent of similar figures in various other traditions (Greek, Armenian, Circassian, Abkhaz, Georgian, Ossete, Roman and so on).\n\nThere are notable differences between the different versions of the so-called \"Prometheus\".\n\nIn all versions, the \"Prometheus\" figure fights against a powerful god who has denied humanity fire. However, other characteristics of this god vary:\n\nGreek version- Prometheus and Zeus\nIn the Greek version, the god Prometheus confronts is in fact the main head of the patriarchal pantheon, Zeus, who is almost always viewed in a positive light, as the loving All-Father, as the wise ruler of all, etc. The tale of Prometheus is one of the few instances where he is viewed negatively. Zeus guards the fire to keep humanity down, because he knows that once humanity has fire, it can make weapons, and progress, leading eventually to an ability to overthrow his rule. In some versions he also reasons that humanity is better off in ignorance and backwardness, without fire, often symbolized by its destructive nature contrasting its use for industry.\n\nGreek version- Kronos and Ouranos\nIn another Greek tale, Ouranos, Zeus' grandfather was originally the ruler of the universe. He ruled with an iron fist and had a paranoid fear of being overthrown, leading him to oppress his own children, the First Generation Titans (6 males-including Kronos, the youngest- and 6 females). This tale did not involve any stealing of fire, but, rather, the overthrow of Ouranos by Kronos (Uranus by Saturn in the highly similar Latin version) brought the knowledge of agriculture to humankind. For Greeks and other Indo-Europeans, agriculture did not require fire, so the tales of how humankind acquired them are separate.\n\nVainakh version\nFor the most part, the Vainakh version is extremely similar to the Greek version of Prometheus. However, rather than the head of the pantheon, as Zeus is, Sela is a major god, but he is not the head of the pantheon (which would be Dela). Like Zeus, Sela owns thunder and lightning and uses lightning as a weapon. However, he shares certain characteristics with the Greek Uranus: he is the god of stars and the sky. Sela's personality also resembles that of Uranus.\n\nThe Pkharmat-character is variously a god, a demigod or a mortal.\n\nVainakh Version\nHumankind attains both fire and agriculture as a result of the conflict between Pkharmat and Sela. Humankind also attains its first instrument- the reedpipe - from the affair, and with it, music, which in Vainakh culture is considered very important and was thought to have mystical properties. In addition to fire, agriculture, the reedpipe, and music, the origin of coal (given to Pkharmat while inside the \"carz\") and how man obtains it is also explained.\n\nGreek Version\nHumankind is only given fire- with which it can make tools. This exemplifies the importance of the forge in Indo-European culture.\n\nAll the indigenous religious traditions with a figure equivalent to Pkharmat were practiced by peoples of the Caucasus and some Indo-European peoples (who sometimes resided in the Caucasus, as is the case with the Armenians and Ossetes, but often didn't, as is the case with the Greeks, Latins, Celtic peoples, etc.). This seems to support the hypothesis that the original homeland of the Indo-European peoples lay to the immediate north of the Caucasus touching both the Black and Caspian Seas and possibly extending north along the Volga some length as well as somewhat west into Ukraine. This hypothesis is now the most widely accepted, rather than the hypotheses that the Indo-European languages originated in the Anatolian plains, in the Armenian highland, India, Balkans or the ancestral Slavic homelands, or that they were a sprachbund. Comparison of the various versions of the stories also support that the original Indo-Europeans probably had more intense cultural exchange with the North Caucasus than the South Caucasus- the forms most close to the Indo-European versions of the tale are, in fact, the Circassian version and the Vainakh version. The Circassian and Abkhaz name for the hero is Pataraz, which shows very noticeable similarity to the Greek name Prometheus, which is similar to most other Indo-European versions; comparing these two, it is also possible to note Pkharmat's similarity. It is possible that Pataraz, Prometheus, Pkharmat and possibly others are all roots from the same original name.\n\n\n"}

Prarthana Samaj was founded by Atmaram Pandurang in 1867 when Kesab Chandra sen visited Maharashtra, with an aim to make people believe in one God and worship only one God. It became popular after Mahadev Govind Ranade joined. The main reformers were the intellectuals who advocated reforms of the social system of the Hindus.It was spread to south India by Telugu reformer,Viresalingam.\n\nThe movement was started as a movement for religious and social reform in Maharashtra and can be seen much more alike Brahmo Samaj. The precursor of the Prarthana Samaj in Mumbai was the Paramahamsa Sabha, a secret society for the furtherance of liberal ideas by Ram Balkrishna Jaykar and others in Mumbai. It was secret in order to avoid the wrath of the powerful and orthodox elements of\n\nBy comparison with the parallel Brahmo Samaj of Bengal, and the ideals of rational or theistic belief and social reform, the Prarthana Samaj(ists) were followers of the great religious tradition of the Marathi Sant Mat like Namdev, Tukaram. The Brahmo Samaj founders examined many world religions, including ancient Vedic texts, which subsequently were not accepted to be infallible or divine. Although the adherents of Prarthana Samaj were devoted theists, they also did not regard the Vedas as divine or infallible. They drew their nourishment from the Hindu scriptures and used the hymns of the old Marathi \"poet-saints\" in their prayers. Their ideas trace back to the devotional poems of the Vitthalas as part of the Vaishnava bhakti devotional movements of the thirteenth century in southern Maharashtra. The Marathi poets had inspired a movement of resistance to the Mughals. But, beyond religious concerns, the primary focus of the Prarthana Samaj was on social and cultural reform.\n\nPrarthana Samaj critically examined the relations between contemporary social and cultural systems and religious beliefs and gave priority to social reform as compared with the political changes already initiated by the British government. Their comprehensive reform movement has led many impressive projects of cultural change and social reform in Western India, such as the improvement of the lot of women and depressed classes, an end to the caste system, abolition of child marriages and infanticide, educational opportunities for women, and remarriage of widows. Its success was guided by Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, a noted Sanskrit scholar, Dr. Atmaram Pandurang, Narayan Chandavarkar, and Justice Mahadev Govinda Ranade. Ranade emphasized that \"the reformer must attempt to deal with the whole man and not to carry out reform on one side only\".\n\n\n"}

He was arrested by Britain's National Crime Agency after a tip-off from Australian Police and convicted of 71 counts of serious sexual assaults against children while posing as a teacher, photographer and devout Christian in Malaysia.\n\nHuckle has been described as one of Britain's worst ever paedophiles, placing him alongside Robert Black, Sidney Cooke, Ian Watkins and Jimmy Savile, despite being only 28 years old at the time of his arrest. On 6 June 2016, he was given 22 life sentences with a minimum prison term of 25 years before being eligible to apply for parole.\n\nHuckle was born into a middle-class family in Ashford, Kent, on 14 May 1986. He was educated at the Harvey Grammar School, Folkestone, where he was described as \"a bit of a loner, but nothing out of the ordinary\" by friends. At the age of 16, he took part in a month-long expedition to visit a school in Namibia before leaving the Harvey Grammar School to study at the nearby South Kent College.\n\nHuckle was a regular worshipper at Ashford Baptist Church, where he was described as a quiet man. He was also a member of a church in London, which he continued to attend up until the time of his re-arrest in January 2015.\n\nAfter leaving education, Huckle spent a gap year in Malaysia from 2005 to 2006. He returned regularly, helping out at local churches and among local communities, before moving there permanently in 2010.\n\nHuckle enrolled onto a short CELTA course with the British Council before starting work as a freelance photographer working in local communities around Kuala Lumpur. He also enrolled onto an IT course with a local university, hoping to further his career and status within the community.\n\nIn addition to Malaysia, where all of the crimes he was convicted of occurred, and Cambodia, which was also mentioned in the trial, Huckle travelled extensively around south-east Asia to countries including Singapore, Laos and India. It has been revealed that, while in India, he persuaded a pastor to invite him to an orphanage in Bangalore to take photos and make videos with the children, posing as a teacher in order to gain trust.\n\nOn 19 December 2014, following an earlier tip-off from Task Force Argos, a highly specialised branch of Australia's Queensland Police Service responsible for the investigation of on-line child exploitation and abuse, Huckle was arrested by officers from Britain's National Crime Agency at London's Gatwick Airport and questioned on suspicion of a number of serious offences against children. He initially refused to answer officers' questions and was bailed under the condition that he stay at his parents' house, while his camera, laptop and hard drives were seized.\n\nPolice officers from Task Force Argos had been aware of a network of paedophiles operating on a dark web network called The Love Zone (TLZ) for some time. They noticed one member who always made posts using the unusual greeting \"hiyas\" and had a distinctive freckle on one of his fingers. Officers explored the Internet and social media, and eventually found a Facebook page matching the profile of the individual they were looking for, including the greeting and freckle. The profile was fake but photos of a vehicle led police to Shannon McCoole, a care worker from Adelaide. A warrant was issued for the arrest of McCoole. Upon entering his house, police discovered that McCoole, who was subsequently sentenced to 35 years in prison, was actually online and running his dark website at the time.\n\nPolice assumed the identity of McCoole and ran his site, which has since been closed down, in an unusual move in order to catch other paedophiles. In running the site, police rescued 85 children from ongoing abuse and arrested hundreds. One member that stuck out was Huckle, due to the number of children he had abused and the attitude of his posts. After discovering his real identity, and exploring the open Internet, they discovered that he was due to return to the United Kingdom shortly to spend Christmas with his family and then immediately alerted the National Crime Agency, who arrested him when he arrived in the UK.\n\nHuckle had been granted bail under the conditions that he live at his parents' address whilst investigations were ongoing. Huckle had no criminal record and was in no positions of responsibility concerning minors. The police therefore after interviewing him released him temporarily, as it would take time to analyse and retrieve evidence from seized computer equipment. In his initial police interview, Huckle made no comment throughout. When out on bail, he was confronted by his parents about the allegations, to which he claimed his innocence. Huckle later admitted to the allegations, at which point his parents refused to allow him to remain in the house and he returned to police custody.\n\nAfter leaving his parents' house Huckle was re-arrested and charged with 91 counts including creation and possession of child pornography, rape of a child under the age of 12, digital penetration, child abuse, and facilitating the commission of child sexual offences by creating a paedophile manual. He was denied bail by the police and remanded to court where his latest application for bail was also denied, Huckle was now in prison custody, initially at HMP Lewes before, due to the severity of the charges, being transferred to HMP Belmarsh in London to await trial.\n\nAt an initial hearing at the Old Bailey, in January 2016, Huckle pleaded not guilty to all 91 charges, which took over an hour to read in court, and prosecutors started to prepare three separate trials as they did not believe a jury should be subjected to all of the graphic evidence that would be presented in a single trial. In April, during a preliminary trial hearing, Huckle pleaded guilty to 71 of the 91 charges he was facing after a particularly disturbing request to watch all of the evidence against him in court. As a result of his confession, prosecutors decided not to pursue a prosecution against the remaining 20 charges, and asked that they lie on file, in order to spare a jury the horror of having to watch graphic images and videos of child abuse since the 71 charges which Huckle admitted to would be sufficient for a lengthy sentence.\n\nDuring the hearings, the full scale of Huckle's crimes became apparent for the first time. Prosecutors, led by Brian O'Neill QC, showed evidence of a long line of horrific crimes that started during Huckle's gap year in 2006 and continued for eight to nine years until he was apprehended in 2014. They included rape of children under the age of 12, possession and distribution of child pornography, creation of child pornography, child abuse, creating a paedophile manual entitled \"Paedophiles And Poverty: Child Lover Guide\", digital penetration of a child under the age of 12, and raising money for his activities via a crowd-funding website. His victims ranged in age from 6 months to 12 years old; one was abused while wearing a nappy, and another was abused for a number of years between the ages of 5 and 12. Huckle belonged to a website called The Love Zone on the dark web, which is obscured from general discovery and only accessible by anonymised means. On the site, he shared photos of his crimes with other members. He boasted about his crimes to other paedophiles, posting such comments as \"Hit the jackpot, a three-year-old girl as loyal to me as my dog and nobody seemed to care\" and \"impoverished kids are definitely much easier to seduce than middle-class kids\". In total, prosecutors unveiled 29 victims and over 20,000 photos, but believe there could be up to 200 victims all over Southeast Asia and thousands more photos in encrypted areas of Huckle's laptop, which authorities have so far been unable to access.\n\nThe hearings revealed some of the stratagems Huckle employed to procure victims, such as taking children out on day trips from orphanages and escorting them home from their own birthday party. Huckle had even talked about marrying one of his young victims so that he could set up a foster home and abuse \"a cycle of children\" who would pass through his home and turn paedophilia into a full-time job. Huckle also created a ledger of his abuses and where he scored the scale of abuse each victim suffered. It was from this ledger that the estimated number of children abused, 200, was gained, although so far authorities have only discovered photographic evidence of the abuse of 29 children due to Huckle refusing to give officers the passwords for encrypted areas of his hard drives.\n\nHuckle was prosecuted under Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which allows British nationals to be tried and convicted in the United Kingdom for child sex crimes committed while overseas in an effort to prevent child sex tourism, known as extraterritorial jurisdiction, a move welcomed by child protection charities.\n\nIt is a rarely used section of the Act: while no official tally is kept, it is believed that Huckle is only the seventh person to be prosecuted under the measure, and that his crimes are the most serious to be prosecuted under it.\n\nHuckle's sentencing hearing began at the Old Bailey on 1 June 2016 and lasted until 3 June 2016, with the sentence itself being passed on 6 June 2016. At the start of the hearing, the judge stated that Huckle should expect to go to prison for a very long time, as he was considering multiple life sentences due to the gravity of the offences committed.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Huckle's lawyer, Philip Sapsford QC, read a statement from Huckle where he blamed his crimes on his immaturity:\nSapsford continued by asking the judge to take into consideration his client's young age, his claims of remorse, and the fact that he has no previous convictions. He also quoted from a psychiatric report that said Huckle had limited sexual experience with women and suffered depression as a teenager. He also stated that, despite the mitigating circumstances, this is the most extensive case of child sex crimes that he has ever been involved in.\n\nIt was also noted during the hearing, in a statement made by the prosecution, how convictions were only sought against crimes for which there was complete photographic evidence. It was noted how Huckle's ledger contained details of 200 children that had been abused but that they have been unable to access certain encrypted sections of his hard drive in order to obtain evidence.\n\nAt the Old Bailey on 6 June 2016, Judge Peter Rook QC sentenced Huckle to life imprisonment on 22 counts with a minimum prison term of 25 years before being eligible to apply for parole. He will be first eligible for parole in 2041, assuming good behaviour and a belief by the Parole Board for England and Wales that he no longer poses a risk to children or the public at that time. However, he could be first eligible for parole in 2040 if time served on remand while awaiting trial is taken into account. Before passing down the sentence, the judge stated that Huckle carried out a campaign of rape and was driven by his own sexual gratification:\nHuckle stood in prayer as he was sentenced. As he was sent down, a woman in the public gallery shouted, \"1,000 deaths is too good for you\".\n\nThe National Crime Agency received criticism from the Malaysian Government, as well as a number of child protection charities in Malaysia, for their handling of the case. Officers from the NCA travelled to Malaysia to engage local charities, who performed child protection workshops in the community where Huckle lived, but they were kept in the dark about the gravity of his crimes. The Malaysian Government stated that they would like further details of the victims so they can offer counselling. On 4 June 2016, the Attorney General of Malaysia, Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali, stated that he was in the process of contacting his counterpart in the UK, and the British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur, in order to obtain information about the case, which would help his investigation into the crimes and his efforts to help Huckle's victims.\n\nThe National Crime Agency responded to the comments from the Malaysian authorities, stating that they revealed enough details to be able to help the charities but were unable to provide full details until the prosecution was completed. For the same reason, severe media restrictions were put in place, which prevented anybody from reporting the story until the British Government had taken steps to ensure that all of Huckle's material had been taken down and that steps had been taken to protect his victims from other predators. On 6 June 2016, however, the National Crime Agency referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, due to the fact that they were aware of Huckle's continued attendance at two churches in the UK up until the time of his re-arrest in January 2015 but did not contact them until sentencing had already begun. The IPCC will look into whether the NCA had acted appropriately and whether more could have been done to determine whether Huckle abused any children in the UK through his relationship with the churches.\n\nThe British Council issued a statement saying that they had reviewed their dealings with Huckle:\n\nThey also stated that procedures would be reviewed, but that pre-employment checks are the responsibility of future employers not their education provider.\n\nAfter the gravity of Huckle's crimes became known, the Malaysian Government set up a telephone hotline for people to call if they have any information about Huckle or if they were abused themselves. The Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, added that he was angered and saddened by Huckle's sexual violation of Malaysian children and called for all parties involved to ensure that children are not exposed to situations where irresponsible people can take advantage of them. In August 2016, in response to the criticism following the Huckle case, Najib Razak announced that a special task force had been set up to investigate how Malaysia's child protection laws could be redrafted to take into account the new ways that child sexual predators such as Huckle were preying on Malaysian children, with the aim of having a new version ready by the end of the year.\n\nFollowing the discovery of Huckle's crimes, the Malaysian Government came under fire from child protection charities for their lack of laws against child abuse and child pornography. James Nayagam, chairman of Suriana Welfare Society for Children, was particularly critical of his government's relaxed nature in dealing with such crimes:\n\nIn the article, Nayagam continued by pointing out that Section 292 of the Penal Code only deals with sale and distribution of obscene material.\n\nWhile the media in the UK were largely supportive of Huckle's sentencing, the Malaysian press widely stated that the punishment was not severe enough, with statements such as \"a thousand years is not enough\", \"We are horrified that the sex fiend [Huckle] will be eligible to appear before a parole board after 23 years\", and \"this monster could be out in 24 years\" appearing in the days after his sentence was announced.\n\n"}

Its legalization became possible on February 19, 1981, when officials of the government of the People's Republic of Poland signed the so-called \"Rzeszów - Ustrzyki Dolne Agreement\" with striking farmers. Previously, Communist government had refused farmers’ right to self-organize, which caused widespread strikes, with the biggest wave taking place in January 1981. The Rural Solidarity was officially recognized on May 12, 1981, and, strongly backed by the Catholic Church of Poland, it claimed to represent at least half of Poland's 3.2 million smallholders.\n\nAfter World War II, Poland became a communist country, a satellite of the Soviet Union. Since collective farming is a key component of communist notion of agriculture, in June 1948, the Polish United Workers' Party decided to begin the process. From the very beginning, compulsory collectivization faced strong resistance of Polish farmers, who did not want to give up their land. Despite using different methods of persuasion, the progress was slow. By 1951, only 1% of arable land was collectivized, with some 23 000 farmers working there. Altogether, in that year there were some 2200 collective farms. Most of them were located in western and northern Poland, in the Recovered Territories, where population consisted of people resettled from former eastern borderlands of Poland. \n\nAfter the Polish October, Władysław Gomułka officially declared that private farms were part of the so-called \"Polish road to Socialism\" and the government gradually changed its stance. In the late 1950s, number of collective farms fell to 1 800, and Poland was the only country of the Soviet Bloc which tolerated private ownership of the arable land. In 1958, Moscow ordered the resumption of collectivization, but unlike her neighbors, Poland refused. By 1960, collectivization in Poland was ended, never to be resumed, and Engels' opinion that peasants would spontaneously create collective forms of agricultural production because of the threat of the big landed estates was not confirmed in Poland.\n\nPreservation of individual agriculture was a key factor in future events. Nevertheless, forced collectivization of farmland had disastrous consequences, as Poland, traditionally a grain exporter, had to import food, including grain, to prevent famine.\n\nIn August 1980, workers of the Vladimir Lenin Gdańsk Shipyard began a strike, which resulted in creation of Solidarity (see: History of Solidarity). After this event, a group of farmers, gathered in the Farmers Self-Defence Committees decided to set up their own, parallel union called Rural Solidarity. At that time, other similar farmers organizations emerged, such as Peasants Solidarity and Union of Agricultural Producers Solidarity. Their objectives were:\n\nOn September 24, 1980, representatives of Polish individual farmers submitted documents to the Warsaw Provincial Court for registration as Rural Solidarity. However, after one month, at the end of October, the court ruled that private farmers were self-employed and as such, were not entitled to organize their own labor union. The disappointed farmers turned to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn November 30, Deputy Minister of Agriculture Andrzej Kacala met with a group of 30 representatives of farmers' unions founding committees from the Warsaw, Lublin, Siedlce, Skierniewice, and Wałbrzych Voivodeships, as well as from the Września–Konin, Golub-Dobrzyń–Kujawy, and the Holy Cross Mountains regions. The representatives informally called themselves Rural Solidarity.\n\nSupported by Lech Wałęsa and the factory workers, the farmers organized on December 14, 1980, the founding congress of Rural Solidarity in Warsaw. It was attended by 1000 delegates, who represented around 600 000 private farmers. Among their demands, there was a call for formal registration of their independent union. However, on December 30, 1980, the Supreme Court announced that its ruling on Rural Solidarity had been postponed. As a result, tensions rose rise between the peasants and local governments across the country.\n\nSoutheastern part of Poland was the area in which individual farmers were very numerous and where position of the Roman Catholic Church was the strongest. Therefore, in early 1981, main center of farmers’ protests was established in the city of Rzeszów, where the strike and the sit-in began on January 5, 1981 and where the center of the movement was established. As Time magazine reported on Monday, February 2, 1981, members of Solidarity and Rural Solidarity occupied \"Headquarters of the old official trade union\" (in fact, it was The House of the Railroad Worker), where they placed a sign which said: \"SOLIDARITY IS MORE THAN JUST A NAME\". The united front of both organizations demanded negotiations toward legitimizing the farmers' union.\n\nOther centers of farmers protests were also located in southeastern Poland, in the towns of Ustrzyki Dolne and Nowy Sącz, but Solidarity members had been evicted from occupied buildings there. It must be noticed that the Solidarity trade union, and its leaders, such as Lech Wałęsa, fully supported demands of it the peasants. As one Solidarity official said, \"We got in touch with our people in all of the major factories around here and let them know that if the police interfered here there would be a general strike without further notice\".\n\nAt the beginning of 1981, peasants striking in Rzeszów joined forces with their comrades from Ustrzyki Dolne, who had been on strike since December 28, 1980, occupying the local government office. The strike in Ustrzyki became known across the country. In different locations in Poland, several strikes broke out (including a hunger strike in Świdnica), and on February 18, 1981, negotiations began. The peasants were helped by such personalities, as Lech Wałęsa, Andrzej Gwiazda, Andrzej Stelmachowski and Jadwiga Staniszkis. Also, among supporters of the peasants, was Primate Stefan Wyszyński, who on February 6, 1981, confirmed \"the right of the farmers to found freely their own associations\".\n\nThe Rzeszów-Ustrzyki Agreement was signed in the night of February 18/19 (in Ustrzyki) and February 20 (in Rzeszów). The government, represented by Minister of Agriculture Andrzej Kacala, did not give permission to creation of a free trade union of the peasants, but legal protection of inheritance of land was confirmed. Other concessions included permission to construct more churches in the countryside and promise of equal treatment of individual farmers. Another concession won by the farmers was the government's promise to reduce its \"pleasure lands\" and reduce the number of facilities selling alcohol. Nevertheless, the state refused to register the organization, stating that the farmers were not wage earners and therefore could not be unonized.\n\nThe Agreement was signed by Minister Kacala, who represented the Government, and Jozef Slisz, Jan Kulaj, Antoni Kopaczewski, Bogdan Lis and Lech Wałęsa. Due to its significance, it is sometimes called the \"Constitution of the Polish Countryside\".\n\nHowever, Rural Solidarity was not legalized until May 12, 1981, after another farmers strike, this time in Bydgoszcz, where it resulted in a major incident, which sparked off the 1981 warning strike in Poland. Its first leader became Jan Kulaj, and the union was banned on December 13, 1981 (see: Martial Law in Poland). Among those who supported restoration of the Rural Solidarity, was Pope John Paul II, who called for it during his 1987 visit to Poland, saying: \"A Pope cannot remain quiet about this even if he were not a Pole\". \n\nRural Solidarity returned in 1989 (see: Polish Round Table Agreement), and has existed since then. Among its leaders, there are Gabriel Janowski, Artur Balazs, Roman Bartoszcze, and Roman Wierzbicki.\n\n"}

Politically, they live in either Okinawa Prefecture or Kagoshima Prefecture. Their languages make up the Ryukyuan languages, considered to be one of the two branches of the Japonic language family, the other being Japanese and its dialects.\n\nRyukyuans are not a recognized minority group in Japan, as Japanese authorities consider them just a subgroup of the Japanese people, akin to the Yamato people and Ainu. Although unrecognized, Ryukyuans constitute the largest ethnolinguistic minority group in Japan, with 1.3 million living in Okinawa Prefecture alone. There is also a considerable Ryukyuan diaspora. As many as 600,000 more ethnic Ryukyuans and their descendants are dispersed elsewhere in Japan and worldwide; mostly in Hawaii and, to a lesser extent, in other territories where there is also a sizable Japanese diaspora. In the majority of countries, the Ryukyuan and Japanese diaspora are not differentiated so there are no reliable statistics for the former.\n\nRecent genetic and anthropological studies indicate that the Ryukyuans are significantly related to the Ainu people and share the ancestry with the indigenous prehistoric Jōmon period (pre 10,000–1,000 BCE) people, who arrived from Southeast Asia, and with the Yamato people who are mostly an admixture of the Yayoi period (1,000 BCE–300 CE) migrants from East Asia (specifically China and the Korean peninsula). The Ryukyuans have a specific culture with some matriarchal elements, native religion, and cuisine which had fairly late 12th century introduction of rice. The population lived on the islands in isolation for many centuries, and in the 14th century from the three divided Okinawan political polities emerged the Ryukyu Kingdom (1429–1879) which continued the maritime trade and tributary relations started in 1372 with Ming dynasty China. In 1609 the kingdom was invaded by Satsuma Domain which allowed its independence being in vassal status because the Tokugawa Japan was prohibited to trade with China, being in dual subordinate status between both China and Japan.\n\nDuring the Meiji period, the kingdom became Ryukyu Domain (1872–1879), after which it was politically annexed by the Empire of Japan. In 1879, after the annexation, the territory was reorganized as Okinawa Prefecture with the last king Shō Tai forcibly exiled to Tokyo. China renounced its claims to the islands in 1895. During this period, Okinawan ethnic identity, tradition, culture and language were suppressed by the Meiji government, which sought to assimilate the Ryukyuan people as Japanese (Yamato). After World War II, the Ryūkyū Islands were occupied by the United States between 1945–1950 and 1950–1972. During this time, there were many violations of human rights. Since the end of World War II, there exists strong resentment against the Japanese government and US military facilities stationed in Okinawa, as seen in the Ryukyu independence movement.\n\nUnited Nations special rapporteur on discrimination and racism Doudou Diène in his 2006 report, noted perceptible level of discrimination and xenophobia against the Ryukyuans, with the most serious discrimination they endure linked to their dislike of American military installations in the archipelago. An investigation into fundamental human rights was suggested.\n\nTheir usual ethnic name derives from the Chinese name for the islands, \"Liuqiu\" (also spelled as Loo Choo, Lew Chew, Luchu, and more), which in the Japanese language is pronounced \"Ryukyu\". The indigenous term for the island of Okinawa is \"Uchinaa\", the people \"Uchinaanchu\", and their language \"Uchinaaguchi\". These terms are rarely used, and are politicized markers of a distinct culture.\n\nAccording to the recent genetic studies, the Ryukyuan people share more alleles with the Jōmon period (16,000–3,000 years ago) hunter-gatherers and Ainu people than the Yamato Japanese, have smaller genetic contributions from Asian continental populations, which supports the dual-structure model of K. Hanihara (1991), a widely accepted theory which suggests that the Yamato Japanese are more admixed with Asian agricultural continental people (from the Korean Peninsula) than the Ainu and the Ryukyuans, with major admixture occurring in and after the Yayoi period (3,000-1,700 years ago). Within the Japanese population the Ryukyu make a separate and one of the two genome-wide clusters along the main-island Honshu. The Jomon ancestry is estimated at approximately 28% or 50-60%, depending to various studies. The admixture event which formed the admixed Ryukyuans was estimated at least 1100–1075 years ago, which corresponds to the Gusuku period, and is considered to be related to the arrival of migrants from Japan. Thus, the Ryukyuans appear to be genetically closest to the Ainu from the Ainu viewpoint, whereas it is exactly the opposite from the Ryukyuans' viewpoint who are closest to the Yamato Japanese.\n\nThe comparative studies on the dental diversity also showed long-term gene flow from outside source (main-island Honshu and from the southern part of East Asia), long-term isolation, and genetic drift which produced the morphological diversification of the modern Ryukyuans. However, the analysis contradicts the idea of direct genetic continuity and affinity between the Jomon (i.e., Ainu) and the Ryukyuans, although several genetic, cranial, dental analyses, and viral infection studies indicated their close relationship, while according to anthropological data are consistently between the Yamato Japanese and Ainu people.\n\nAccording to archaeological evidence, there's prehistoric cultural differentiation between the Northern Ryukyu Islands (Amami Islands and Okinawa Islands) and the Southern Ryukyu Islands (Miyako Islands and Yaeyama Islands). The genome-wide differentiation was pronounced, especially between Okinawa and Miyako. It is considered to have arisen due to genetic drift rather than admixture with people from neighboring regions, with the divergence dated to the Holocene, and without major genetic contribution of the Pleistocene inhabitants to the present-day Southern Islanders. The Amami Islanders are also slightly more similar to the mainland population than the Okinawa Islanders.\n\nThe female mtDNA and male Y chromosome markers are used to study human migrations. The research on the skeletal remains from the Neolithic Shell midden period (also known as Kaizuka period) in Okinawa, as well from the Gusuku Period, showed predominance of female haplogroups D4 and M7a and their genetic continuity in the contemporary female population of Okinawa. It is assumed that M7a represents \"Jomon genotype\" introduced by a Paleolithic ancestor from Southeast Asia or the southern region of the Asian continent, around the Last Glacial Maximum with the Ryukyu Islands as one of the probable origin spots, in contrast, the frequency of the D4 haplogroup is relatively high in East Asian populations, including in Japan, indicating immigrant Yayoi people, probably by the end of the late Kaizuka period, while haplogroup B4 presumably ancient aboriginal Taiwanese ancestry. However, as in the contemporary Japanese population M7 showed a decrease, whereas the frequency of the haplogroup N9b showed an increase from the south to north direction, it indicates that the mobility pattern of females and males was different as the distribution of Y haplogroups do not show a geographical gradient in contrast to mtDNA, meaning mainly different maternal origins of the contemporary Ryukyuan and Ainu people.\n\nThe research on the contemporary Okinawan male Y chromosome showed, in 2006; 55.6% of haplogroup D-P37.1, 22.2% O-P31, 15.6% O-M122, 4.4% C-M8, and 2.2% others. It is considered that the Y haplogroups expanded in a demic diffusion. The haplogroups D and C are considered of Paleolithic origin, with coalescence time of c. 19,400 YBP and expansion 12,600 YBP, i.e. 14,500 YBP and 10,820 YBP respectively, and were isolated for thousands of years once land bridges between Japan and continental Asia disappeared at the end of the last glacial maximum c. 12,000 YBP. The haplogroup O began its expansion circa 4,000-3,810 years ago, and thus the haplogroups D1b and C1 belong to the Jomon's male lineage, and haplogroup O belongs to the Yayoi's male lineage. Haplogroup M12 is considered as mitochondrial counterpart of Y chromosome D lineage. This rare haplogroup was detected only in Yamato Japanese, Koreans, and Tibetans, with the highest frequency and diversity in Tibet.\n\nThe Ryukyu Islands were inhabited from at least 32,000-18,000 years ago, but their fate and relation with contemporary Ryukyuan people is uncertain. During the Jōmon period (i.e., Kaizuka) or so-called shell midden period (6,700-1,000 YBP) of the Northern Ryukyus, the population lived in a hunter-gatherer society, with similar mainland Jōmon pottery. In the latter part of Jōmon period, archaeological sites moved near the seashore, suggesting the engagement of people in fishery. It is considered that from the latter half of Jōmon period, the Ryukyu Islands developed their own culture. Some scholars consider that the language and cultural influence was more far-reaching than blending of race and physical types. The Yayoi culture, traditionally dated from 3rd century BCE and recently from around 1000 BCE, is notable for the introduction of Yayoi-type pottery, metal tools and cultivation of rice, however although some Yayoi pottery and tools were excavated on the Okinawa Islands, the rice was not cultivated before the 12th century CE, nor the Yayoi and the following Kofun period (250–538 CE) culture expanded into the Ryukyus. The Southern Ryukyus culture was isolated from the Northern, and its Shimotabaru period (4,500–3,000 YBP) was characterized by a specific style of pottery, and the Aceramic period (2,500–800 YBP), during which no pottery was produced in this region. Their prehistoric Yaeyama culture showed some intermingled affinities with southern Indonesian and Melanesian cultures, broadly, that the Sakishima Islands have some traces similar to the Southeast Asian and South Pacific cultures. The Amami Islands seem to be the islands with the most mainland Japanese influence. However, both north and south Ryukyus were culturally unified in the 10th century.\n\nThe finding of ancient Chinese knife money near Naha in Okinawa indicate a probable contact with the ancient Chinese state Yan as early as the 3rd century BCE. According to the \"Shan Hai Jing\", the Yan had relations with the Wa (dwarf, short) people living southeast of Korea, who could be related to both the mainland Japanese or Ryukyuan people. The futile search for the elixir of immortality by Qin Shi Huang, the founder of Qin dynasty (221 BC–206 BC), in which the emperor tried to cooperate with \"happy immortals\" who dwelt on the islands, could be related to both Japan and Ryukyu Islands. There's lack of evidence that the missions by Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) reached the islands, however as the Japanese did reach Han's capital, notes from 57 CE do mention a general practice of tattooing among the people of \"hundred kingdoms\" in the eastern islands, a practice which was widespread and survived only among the Okinawan's women, Ainu in Hokkaido, and Atayal people in Taiwan. Cao Wei (220–265) and Han dynasty record show that the inhabitants of western and southern Japan and Okinawa had a lot in common regarding political-social institutions until the 2nd century CE - they were of small stature, bred oxen and swine, as well were ruled by women, with special influence of women sorceresses, which is related to the Ryukyuan Noro priestesses which were closely associated with local political power until the 20th century, as well the Ryukyuan swine economy culture until World War II. It is suggested that the mention of a specific sorceress Pimeku, her death and successive conflict, is related to some socio-political challenges of the ancient matriarchal system.\n\nThe first certain mention of the islands and its people by the Chinese and Japanese is dated in the 7th century. Emperor Yang of Sui, due to previous tradition, between 607-608 held expeditions in search of the \"Land of Happy Immortals\". As the Chinese envoy and the islanders linguistically could not understand each other, and the islanders did not want to accept the Sui rule and suzerainty, the Chinese envoy took many captives back to the court. The islands, by the Chinese named Liuqiu, would be pronounced by the Japanese as Ryukyu. However, when the Japanese diplomat Ono no Imoko arrived at the Chinese capital he noted that the captives probably arrived from the island of Yaku south of Kyushu. In 616 the Japanese annals for the first time mention the \"Southern Islands people\", and for the half-century were noted some intruders from Yaku and Tanu. According to \"Shoku Nihongi\", in 698 a small force dispatched by Japanese government successfully claimed the Tane-jima, Yakushima, Amami, Tokunoshima and other islands. \"Nihongi\" recorded that the Hayato people in southern Kyushu still had female chieftains in the early 8th century. In 699 are mentioned islands Amami and Tokara, in 714 Shingaki and Kume, in 720 some 232 persons who had submitted to the Japanese capital Nara, and at last Okinawa in 753. Nevertheless the mention or authority, over the centuries the Japanese influence spread slowly among the communities.\n\nThe lack of written record resulted with later, 17th century royal tales both under Chinese and Japanese influence, which were efforts by local chieftains to explain the \"divine right\" of their royal authority, as well the then-political interests of Tokugawa \"shōguns\" from Minamoto clan who wanted to legitimize Japanese domination over Okinawa. The tradition states that the founder of Tenson Dynasty was a descendant of goddess Amamikyu, and the dynasty ruled 17,000 years and had 25 kings i.e. chieftains. However, the 24th throne was usurped from one of Tenson's descendants by a man named Riyu, who was defeated in revolt led by Shunten (1187 – 1237), lord of Urasoe. Shunten's parental origin is a matter of debate, according to 17th century romantic tales he was a son of a local Okinawan chief's (\"anji\") daughter and some Japanese adventurer, usually considered Minamoto no Tametomo, while historical and archeological-traditional evidence indicate men from the defeated Taira clan who fled Minamoto's clan vengeance. Shunten Dynasty made two additional chieftains, Shunbajunki (1237-1248) and Gihon (1248–1259). As Gihon abdicated, his sessei Eiso (1260–1299), who claimed Tenson's descent, founded the Eiso Dynasty.\n\nDuring the Gusuku period (c. 1187–1314), with recent chronology dated from c. 900-950 CE, Okinawans made significant political, social and economical growth. As the center of power moved away from the seashore to inland, the period is named after many \"gusuku\", castle-like fortifications which were built in higher places. This period is also notable, compared to mainland Japan, for fairly late introduction of agricultural production of rice, wheat, millet and the overseas trading of these goods, as well during Shubanjunki's rule the introduction of Japanese kana writing system in its older and simple phonetic form. After the years of famine and epidemic during the Gihon's rule, Eiso introduced regular taxation system (of weapons, grains and cloth) in 1264 and as the government gained strength, the control extended from Okinawa toward the islands of Kume, Kerama, Iheya, and Amami Oshima (1266). Between 1272 and 1274, as the Mongol invasions of Japan began, Okinawa on two occasions rejected the Mongols' authority demands. To Eiso's reign period is also ascribed the introduction of Buddhism into Okinawa.\n\nDuring the rule of Eiso's great-grandson, Tamagusuku (1314–1336), Okinawa became divided into three polities and began the so-called Sanzan period (1314–1429). The north and largest Hokuzan polity was the poorest due to forest and mountainous terrain (in which isolation was an advantage), with primitive farming and fishing. The central Chūzan polity was the most advantaged due to its developed castle towns and harbor facilities. The south Nanzan polity was the smallest, but endured because of good castle positions and sea merchants.\n\nIn this period another rapid economical, social and cultural development of Ryukyu began as the polities had developed formal trade relations with Japan, Korea and China. During the Satto's reign, Chūzan made tributary relations with China's Ming dynasty in 1374 as the [Hongwu Emperor]] sent envoys in 1372 to Okinawa. In the next two decades Chūzan made nine official missions to the Chinese capital, and the formal relations between them endured until 1872 (see Imperial Chinese missions to Ryukyu Kingdom). Despite significant Chinese economical, cultural and political influence, the polities continued to maintain strong autonomy. In 1392, all three polities began to send extensive missions to the Korean Joseon kingdom. In 1403, Chūzan made formal relations with the Japanese Ashikaga shogunate, and an embassy was sent to Thailand in 1409. The contacts with Siam continued even in 1425, and were newly made with places like Palembang in 1428, Java in 1430, Malacca and Sumatra in 1463.\n\nAs in 1371, China initiated its maritime prohibition policy (Haijin) to Japan, Ryukyu gained a lot from its position as intermediary in the trade between Japan and China. They shipped horses, sulphur and seashells to China, from China brought ceramics, copper, and iron, from southeast Asian countries bought tin, ivory, spices (pepper), wood (sappanwood), which they sold to Japan, Korea or China, as well as transporting Chinese goods to Hakata Bay from where swords, silver and gold were brought.\n\nIn 1392, 36 Chinese families from Fujian were invited by the chieftain of Okinawa Island's central polity (Chūzan) to settle near the port of Naha and to serve as diplomats, interpreters, and government officials. Some consider that many Ryukyuan officials were descended from these Chinese immigrants, being born in China or having Chinese grandfathers. They assisted the Ryukyuans in advancing their technology and diplomatic relations. From the same year onward Ryukyu was allowed to send official students to China i.e. Guozijian. The tributary relationship with China later became a basis of the 19th century Sino-Japanese disputes about the claims of Okinawa.\n\nBetween 1416 and 1429, Chūzan chieftain Shō Hashi successfully unified the principalities into the Ryukyuan Kingdom (1429–1879) with the castle town Shuri as royal capital, founded the First Shō Dynasty, and the island continued to prosper through maritime trade, especially tributary relations with the Ming dynasty. The period of Shō Shin's (1477–1526) rule, descendant from the Second Shō Dynasty, is notable for peace and relative prosperity, peak in overseas trade, as well as expansion of the kingdom's firm control to Kikaijima, Miyako-jima and Yaeyama Islands (1465–1524), while during Shō Sei (1526-1555) to Amami Ōshima (1537).\n\nAfter the Kyūshū Campaign (1586–1587) by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, his assistant Kamei Korenori, who was interested in southern trade, wanted to be rewarded with the Ryukyu Islands. A paper fan found during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) mentioning a title \"Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu\", reveals that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post although he had not any legitimate claim upon the islands. In 1591, Kamei ventured with a force to reclaim the islands, but the Shimazu clan stopped him as they guarded their special relationship with the Ryukyu kingdom. Hideyoshi was not very concerned about the quarrel because the invasion of Korea was more important in his mind. As the Ming's influence weakened due to disorder in China, Japanese established posts in Southeast Asia, and the Europeans (Spanish and Portuguese) arrived, the kingdom's overseas trade began to decline.\n\nIn the early 17th century during the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867), the first \"shōgun\" Tokugawa Ieyasu intended to subject the kingdom to enable intermediary trade with China, and in 1603 ordered the Ryukyuan king to pay his respect to the shogunate. As the king did not react, with the instruction of the \"shōgun\", the Satsuma feudal domain of the Shimazu clan in Kyūshū incorporated some of kingdom's territory during the 1609 Invasion of Ryukyu. They nominally let a certain level of autonomy and independence to the kingdom due to Ming's prohibition of trade with the shogunate, but forbade them trade with other countries except China. The Amami Islands became part of Shimazu's territory, taxes were imposed, making them subordinate in the relations between Japan and China. Until the invasion, the Shimazu clan lords for four centuries had a vague title of the \"Lords of the Twelve Southern Islands\" or \"Southern Islands\", although initially meaning the near Kyushu islands, then covering all the Ryukyu Islands. Later in the 1870s this was used as a \"justification\" of Japan's sovereignty. From 1609 the Ryukyuan missions to Edo started which lasted until 1850.\n\nDuring the rule of kings Shō Shitsu (1648–1668) and Shō Tei (1669–1709) i.e. sessei Shō Shōken (1666–1673) were recovered the internal social and economical stability with many laws about government organisation, and affairs like sugarcane production, and tax system with emphasis on agricultural production. The production was encouraged because Satsuma's annual tax deprived Ryukyu's internal resources. Although the production of sweet potatoes and sugar industry grew, the peasants were not allowed to enlarge their fields. The agricultural reforms especially continued under king Shō Kei (1713–1752) and his sanshikan advisor Sai On (1728–1752) whose \"Nomucho\" (Directory of Agricultural Affairs) from 1743 became the basis of the agricultural administration until the 19th century. In the Sakishima Islands great part of the tax was paid in textiles made of ramie. The relations with Qing dynasty improved after their second mission when the first Ryukyuan official students were sent to China in 1688.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, French politicians like Jean-Baptiste Cécille unsuccessfully tried to conclude a French trade treaty with Ryukyu, with only a promise by Shuri government about the admission of Christian missionaries. However, due to extreme measures in teaching, Bernard Jean Bettelheim's propagation of Protestantism between 1846–1854 was obscured by the government.\n\nDuring the Meiji period (1868–1912) the \"Ryukyu shobun\" process started, according to which the kingdom became under jurisdiction of Kagoshima Prefecture in 1871, and then became the Ryukyu Domain (1872–1879) of the Meiji Japan. However, this way of events were done to avoid Ryukyu and China revolt, and the Shuri government was not aware of their importance including when Japan decided to politically represent the Ryukyuan islanders involved in the Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874). In 1875, the Ryukyus were forced to terminate their tribute relations with China against their wish for the status of dual subordination to China and Japan, something weakened China was unable to stop, with the proposition by U.S. 18th president Ulysses S. Grant about sovereign Okinawa and division of other islands between China and Japan rejected as the Chinese court at the last minute decided not to ratify the agreement. The king did not submit on three occasions between 1875–1879, and in 1879 the domain was formally abolished and established as Okinawa prefecture, forcing the last Ryukyu king Shō Tai to move to Tokyo, with the reduced status of viscount. The Ryukyu's aristocratic class resisted annexation for almost two decades (e.g. Kōchi Chōjō, Rin Seikō), but after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), China's and the Ryukyus' sovereignty interests faded as China renounced its claims. Many historians criticized the Meiji's consideration as a simple administration change rather than being Japan's first colony and inner colonialism.\n\nDuring the Meiji period, like with the Ainu in Hokkaido, the Ryukyuans had their own culture, religion, traditions, and language suppressed by the Meiji government and faced forced assimilation. Since the 1880s, schools forbade display of their culture, dress, hairstyle and other considering them backward and inferior and introducing them to the Japanese culture and fashion. The militaristic indoctrination and emperor-centered ideology started from elementary school. The ultimate goal of education was the unification into Yamato people (embodied with the myth of ethnic purity, with on-going ideological Nihonjinron ignoring the minorities), and often faced prejudice, work humiliation and ethnic discrimination. The local elite was divided into factions who opposed or supported the assimilation. Around and especially after the Japanese annexation of Taiwan in 1895, the development was shifted away from Okinawa which resulted with famine period known as \"Sotetsu-jigoku\" (\"Cycad hell\"). In 1920–1921, the drop of sugar prices which continued until 1931 as well transfer of sugar production to Taiwan, being the poorest prefecture yet had heaviest tax burden, resulted with economical crisis and people were forced to find labor in Japan (often Osaka and Kobe) or abroad in Taiwan. By 1935, approximately 15% of population emigrated.\n\nDuring World War II and battles like the Battle of Okinawa (1945) approximately 150,000 civilian people (1/3 of population) were killed in Okinawa alone. After the World War II, the Ryukyu Islands were occupied by the United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands (1945–1950), but the U.S. maintained control even after the 1951 Treaty of San Francisco, which went into effect on April 28, 1952, as was replaced by the USCAR (1950–1972) government. During this period U.S. military requisitioned private land for the building of their facilities, with the private owners put into refugee camps, and its personnel statistically committed thousands of crimes against the civilians. Only twenty years later, on 15 May 1972, Okinawa and near islands were returned to Japan. As the Japanese had post-war political freedom and economic prosperity, the facilities had a negative economical impact and people felt to be cheated, used for the purpose of Japanese and regional security against communist threat, while others considered it a national disgrace. Since 1972 are held extensive plans to bring Okinawa's economy to national level, as well continued support of the local culture and revival of traditional arts started by the USCAR.\n\nOkinawa comprises just 0.6% of Japan's total land mass, yet about 75 percent of all U.S. military installations stationed in Japan are assigned to bases in Okinawa. The presence of the military remains a sensitive issue in local politics. Feelings against the mainland Government, Emperor (especially Hirohito due to his involvement in the sacrifice of Okinawa and later military occupation), and U.S. military (USFJ, SACO) have often caused open criticism and protests, for example of 85,000 people in 1995 after the U.S. military rape incident, or 110,000 people in 2007 due to Ministry of Education's textbook revisions (see MEXT controversy) of the Japanese military forced mass suicide of the civilians during the Battle of Okinawa. For many years the Emperors avoided visiting Okinawa, with the first ever in history done by Akihito in 1993, since it was assumed that his visits would likely cause uproar rather than respect, like in July 1975 when Akihito as a crown prince visited Okinawa and a firebomb was thrown at him, although these tensions have eased in recent years. Discrimination against Okinawans both past and present on part of the mainland Japanese is the cause of their smoldering resentment against the government, seen in the post-war Ryukyu independence movement.\n\nRyukyuans tend to see themselves as bound together by their home island and, especially among older Ryukyuans, usually consider themselves from Okinawa first and Japan second. The average annual income per resident of Okinawa in 2006 was ¥2.09 million, placing the prefecture at the bottom of the list of 47.\n\nThe Okinawans have a very low age-adjusted mortality rate at older ages and among the lowest prevalence of cardiovascular disease and other age-associated diseases in the world. Furthermore, Okinawa has long had the highest life expectancy at older ages, as well has had among the highest prevalence of centenarians among the 47 Japanese prefectures, also the world, since records began to be kept by the Ministry of Health in the early 1960s despite the high birth rate and expanding population of Okinawa prefecture. This longevity phenotype has been in existence since records have been kept in Japan, and despite the well-known dietary and other nongenetic lifestyle advantages of the Okinawans (Blue Zone), there may be some additional unknown genetic influence favoring this extreme phenotype. The Okinawa Centenarian Study (OCS) research team began to work in 1976, making it the world's longest ongoing population-based study of centenarians\n\nSimilarities between the Ryukyuan and Japanese languages suggests a common origin, possibly of immigrants from continental Asia to the archipelago. Previously ideologically considered by the Japanese scholars as a dialect and descendant from the Old Japanese language, the Ryukyuan languages are a sister and mutually unintelligible branch of Japanese and sometime Hachijō language, and a branch of Japonic languages. As the Jōmon-Yayoi transition (c. 1000 BCE) represents the formative period of the contemporary Japanese people, it is argued that the Japonic languages are related to the Yayoi migrants. The estimated time of separation between Ryukyuan and mainland Japanese is a matter of debate due to methodological problems; older estimates (1959–2009) varied between 300 BCE–700 CE, while novel (2009-2011) around 2nd century BCE-100 CE, which has a lack of correlation with archeology and new chronology according to which Yayoi period started around 950 BCE, or the proposed spread of the Proto-Ryukyuan speakers to the islands in the 10-12th century from Kyushu. Based of linguistic differences, they separated at least before the 7th century, before or around Kofun period (c. 250–538), while mainland Proto-Ryukyuan was in contact with Early Middle Japanese until 13th century. The Northern Ryukyuan does not, while Southern Ryukyuan does show north-to-south expansion and thus exist several scenarios. It is generally considered that the likely homeland of Japonic and Proto-Ryukyuan expansion was in Kyushu, compared to another hypothesis of expansion from Ryukyu to mainland Japan.\n\nAs the Japanese (or Yamato people) learned to write and read a thousand years before the Ryukyuans and absorbed many Chinese language forms, the early literature which records the language of the Old Japanese imperial court show archaisms which are closer to Okinawan dialects. The Ryukyuan language is divided into two main groups, Northern Ryukyuan languages and Southern Ryukyuan languages, and generally are considered the existence of five Ryukyuan languages; Amami, Okinawa, Miyako, Yaeyama and Yonaguni, while the sixth Kunigami is added due to diversity. Within them and on specific islands exist local dialects, of which many vanished. Despite the use of Shuri Okinawan in the Shuri Court and its reputation, there's no standard variety. Thus, the Ryukyuan languages constitute a cluster of local dialects termed as unroofed abstand languages, \"unroofed\" meaning without written standard.\n\nDuring the Meiji and post-Meiji period the languages were identified as dialects of Japanese, and viewed negatively were suppressed by the Japanese government which forced assimilation and standard Japanese language. From 1907, the children were prohibited to speak Ryukyuan languages in school, and since the mid-1930s there existed dialect cards, a system of punishment for the students who spoke in a non-standard language. Speaking a Ryukyuan language was deemed an unpatriotic act, by 1939 a speaker was denied service and employment in government offices, while by the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 the military was commanded to consider Ryukyuan speakers as spies (death penalty) with many reports that such action was carried out. After WW II, during the United States occupation the Ryukyuan languages and identity were distinctively promoted, also because of ideo-political reasons to separate the Ryukyus from Japan, however as the resentment against the occupation intensified their rapport and unification with Japan, since 1972 followed re-incursion of the standard Japanese and further diminution of the Ryukyuan languages.\n\nIt is considered that contemporary people older than 85 exclusively use Ryukyuan, between 45 and 85 use Ryukyuan and standard Japanese depending on family or working environment, younger than 45 are able to understand Ryukyuan, while younger than 30 mainly are not able to understand and speak Ryukyuan languages. The Ryukyuan languages are on the UNESCO's list of endangered languages since 2009, as they could disappear by the mid-century. It is unclear whether this recognition was too late, despite some positive influence by the Society of Spreading Okinawan.\n\nNative Ryukyuan religion places strong emphasis upon the role of the women in the community, with women holding positions as shamans and guardians of the home and hearth. The status of women in traditional society is higher than in China and Japan. Although the contemporary kinship system is patrilineal and patrilocal, until the 20th century it was often bilateral and matrilocal, with common village endogamy. Shisa statues can often be seen on or in front of houses—this relates to the ancient Ryukyuan belief that the male spirit is the spirit of the outside and the female spirit is the spirit of the inside. Godhood is mimicked with many attributes, and its in ease without any underlying symbolic order.\n\nThe village priestesses, Noro, until the 20th century used the white cloth and magatama beads. The noro's duty was to preserve the generational fire in the hearth, a communal treasure, resulting with tabu system about the fire custodian in which they had to be virgins to maintain close communication with the ancestors. The office became hereditary, usually of the noro's brother's female child. The center of worship was represented by three heartstones within or near the house. The belief in the spiritual predominance of the sister was more prominent in Southern Ryukyus.\n\nThe introduction of Buddhism is ascribed to a 13th century priest from Japan (mostly funeral rites), while the 14th century trade relations resulted with Korean Buddhism influences (including some in architecture), as well Shinto practices from Japan. Buddhism and native religion were ideological basis until 18th century, when Confucianism gradually and officially became government ideology during Shō On (1795–1802), much to the dismay of Kumemura. It was mostly important to the upper class families. Among the Catholic converts was not lost the former religious consciousness.\n\nUntil the 18th century, the Ryukyuan kings visited the Sefa-utaki (historical sacred place) caves for worship. Another traditional sacred places are springs Ukinju-Hain-ju, where was placed the first rice plantation, and small island Kudaka, where the \"five fruits and grains\" were introduced by divine people, perhaps strangers with agricultural techniques. The foremost account, which claimed common origin between the Japanese and Ryukyuan people, was made-up by Shō Shōken in the 17th century, to end up the pilgrimage of the Ryukyu king and chief priestess to the Kudaka island.\n\nDuring the Meiji period the government replaced Buddhism with Shintoism as the islands' state religion, and ordered; rearrangement of statues and redesign of shrines and temples to incorporate native deities into national Shinto pantheon; Shinto worship preceded native, Buddhist, or Christian ritual; transformation of local divinities into guardian gods. In the 1920s was ordered building of Shinto shrines and remodelling of previous with Shinto architectural symbols, paid by local tax money, which was a financial burden due to the collapse of sugar prices in 1921 which devastated Okinawa's economy. In 1932 were ordered to house and support Shinto clergy from the mainland.\n\nMost Ryukyuans of the younger generations are not serious adherents of the native religion anymore. Additionally, since being under Japanese control, Shinto and Buddhism are also practiced and typically mixed with local beliefs and practices.\n\nOkinawan food is rich in vitamins and minerals and is a good balance of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Although rice is a staple food (taco rice mixes it with beef), pork (\"mimigaa and chiragaa\", dishes Rafute and Soki), seaweed, rich miso (fermented soybean) pastes and soups (Jūshī), sweet potato and brown sugar all feature prominently in native cuisine. Most famous to tourists is the \"Momordica charantia\", \"gōya\" (bitter melon), which is often mixed into representative Okinawan stir fry dish known as champurū (Goya champuru). Kōrēgusu is a common hot sauce condiment used in various dishes including noodle soup Okinawa soba. Some specifically consumed algae include Caulerpa lentillifera. Traditional sweets include chinsuko, hirayachi, sata andagi, and muchi. Local beverages include juice from \"Citrus depressa\", turmeric tea (\"ukoncha\"), and the alcoholic beverage awamori.\n\nThe weight-loss Okinawa diet derives from their cuisine and has only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.\n\nThe techniques of self-defense and using farm tools as weapons against armed opponents—called Karate by today's martial artists—was created by Ryukyuans who probably incorporated some gong fu and native techniques from China into a complete system of attack and defense known simply as \"Ti\" (literally meaning \"hand\"). These martial arts varied slightly from town to town, and were named for their towns of origin, examples being Naha-te (currently known as Goju-Ryū), Tomari-te and Shuri-te.\n\nThe Kabura-ya (Japanese signal arrow) still has a ceremonial use for house, village or festival celebration in Okinawa.\nIt is considered that the rhythms and patterns of dances, like Eisa and Angama, represent legends and prehistoric heritage. Ryūka genre of songs and poetry originate from the Okinawa Islands. From the Chinese traditional instrument sanxian in the 16th century developed the Okinawan instrument sanshin from which ultimately derives Kankara sanshin and the Japanese shamisen.\n\nWomen frequently wore indigo tattoos known as \"hajichi\" on the backs of their hands, a sign of adulthood and talisman to protect them from evil. These tattoos were banned in 1899 by the Meiji government. In remote districts their \"katakashira\" off-center topknot, similar to Yami and Filipinos of Malay descent in Mindanao and elsewhere, among men and women also disappeared in the early 20th century.\n\nThe \"bashôfu\", literally meaning \"banana-fibre cloth\", is designated as a part of Ryukyu and Japan \"important intangible cultural properties\". The weaving using indigenous ramie was also widespread in the archipelago, both originated before the 14th century.\n\nOriginally living in thatching houses, townsmen developed architecture modeled after Japanese, Chinese and Korean structures. Other dwellings suggest a tropical origin, and some villages have high stone walls, with similar structural counterpart in Yami people at Orchid Island.\n\nFor the listed categories of Cultural Properties see; archaeological materials, historical materials, crafts, paintings, sculptures, writings, intangible, and tangible.\n\nThe most notable people of Ryukyuan birth or descendance in Japan include:\n\nIn karate martial arts, Matsumura Sōkon, Ankō Itosu, Ankō Asato, Kenwa Mabuni (Shitō-ryū), Gichin Funakoshi (Shotokan), Chōjun Miyagi (Gōjū-ryū), Chōki Motobu (Motobu-ryu), Tatsuo Shimabuku (Isshin-ryū), Kanbun Uechi (Uechi-ryū), Kentsū Yabu (teacher of Shōrin-ryū).\n\nIn scholar studies, journalism or literature, Sai On, Shō Shōken, Tei Junsoku, Iha Fuyū, Higashionna Kanjun, Ōta Chōfu (journalist), Tatsuhiro Oshiro (novelist).\n\nIn music, female solo singers Namie Amuro (quarter-Italian), Cocco, Beni (American father), Chitose Hajime, male solo singer-songwriter and actor Gackt, members of band Begin, Orange Range, Mongol800, Stereopony and High and Mighty Color, members of group Speed, MAX and Da Pump (four original members).\n\nIn the entertaining business, female actress Yui Aragaki, notably for the television drama Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu.\n\nIn sport, baseball players Nagisa Arakaki and Hideki Irabu (mother), bicycle racer Yukiya Arashiro, footballer Kazuki Ganaha, boxers Yoko Gushiken, Akinobu Hiranaka Katsuo Tokashiki, and golf player Ai Miyazato.\n\nThe most notable people of Ryukyuan origin or mixed ancestry in diaspora include:\n\nIn Hawaii, U.S. World War II soldier and Medal of Honor receiver Yeiki Kobashigawa, Olympic gold medalist Yoshi Oyakawa, singer Ethel Azama, current Governor of Hawaii David Ige, ukulele player Jake Shimabukuro, and Youtuber Ryan Higa.\n\nIn other parts of the United States, musicians James Iha and Kishi Bashi (mother), singer Yuki Chikudate, actors Tamlyn Tomita and Brian Tee (father), storyboard artist Natasha Allegri (mother), baseball player and coach Dave Roberts (mother).

{"id": "8127579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8127579", "title": "Sakhalin Koreans", "text": "Sakhalin Koreans\n\nSakhalin Koreans are Russian citizens and residents of Korean descent living on Sakhalin Island, who trace their roots to the immigrants from the Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces of Korea during the late 1930s and early 1940s, the latter half of the Japanese colonial era. At the time, the southern half of Sakhalin Island, then known as Karafuto Prefecture, was under the control of the Empire of Japan; the Japanese government both recruited and forced Korean labourers into service and shipped them to Karafuto to fill labour shortages resulting from World War II. The Red Army invaded Karafuto days before Japan's surrender; while all but a few Japanese there repatriated successfully, almost one-third of the Koreans could not secure permission to depart either to Japan or their home towns in South Korea. For the next forty years, they lived in exile. In 1985, the Japanese government offered transit rights and funding for the repatriation of the original group of Sakhalin Koreans; however, only 1,500 of them returned to South Korea in the next two decades. The vast majority of Koreans of all generations chose instead to stay on Sakhalin.\n\nDue to differing language and immigration history, Sakhalin Koreans may or may not identify themselves as Koryo-saram. The term \"Koryo-saram\" may be used to encompass to all Koreans in the former USSR, but typically refers to ethnic Koreans from Hamgyŏng province whose ancestors emigrated to the Russian Far East in the 19th century, and then were later deported to Central Asia. The issue of self-identification is complicated by the fact that many Sakhalin Koreans feel that Koreans from Central Asia look down on them.\n\nKorean immigration to Sakhalin began as early as the 1910s, when the Mitsui Group began recruiting labourers from the peninsula for their mining operations. In 1920, ten years after the annexation of Korea by Japan, there were fewer than one thousand Koreans in the whole of Karafuto Prefecture, overwhelmingly male. Aside from an influx of refugees from the Maritimes, who escaped to Karafuto during the Russian Revolution of 1917, the number of Koreans in the province did not rise very rapidly; as late as the mid-1930s, there were fewer than 6,000 Koreans in Karafuto. However, as Japan's war effort picked up, the Japanese government sought to put more people on the ground in the sparsely-populated prefecture in order to ensure their control of the territory and fill the increasing demands of the coal mines and lumber yards. Recruiters turned to sourcing workers from the Korean peninsula; at one point, over 150,000 Koreans were relocated to work on the island. Of those, around 10,000 mine workers were relocated to Japan prior to the war's end; present-day Sakhalin Koreans' efforts to locate them proved futile.\nThe Imperial Japanese Army in Karafuto frequently used local ethnic minorities (Oroks, Nivkhs, and Ainu) to conduct intelligence-gathering activities, because, as indigenous inhabitants, their presence would not arouse suspicion on the Soviet half of the island. Ethnic Koreans could also be found on both sides of the border, but the use of Koreans as spies was not common, as the Karafuto police were wary of the support for the independence movement among Koreans. Soviet suspicion towards Korean nationalism, along with fears that the Korean community might harbour Japanese spies, led to the 1937 deportation of Koreans from Soviet-controlled northern Sakhalin and the Russian Far East.\n\nThe Soviet Union invaded the Japanese portion of Sakhalin on August 11, 1945, resulting the deaths of 20,000 civilians (see Soviet–Japanese War (1945)). In the confusion that ensued, a rumour began to spread that ethnic Koreans could be serving as spies for the Soviet Union, and led to massacres of Koreans by Japanese police and civilians. Despite the generally limited amount of information about the massacres, two examples of massacres are comparatively well-known today: the incident in Kamishisuka (now Leonidovo) on August 18, 1945, and the incident in Mizuho Village (now Pozharskoye), which lasted from August 20 to August 23, 1945.\n\nIn Kamishisuka, the Japanese police arrested 19 Koreans on charges of spy activities; 18 were found shot within the police station the next day. The sole survivor, a Korean known only by his Japanese name Nakata, had survived by hiding in a toilet; he later offered testimony about the event. In Mizuho Village, Japanese fleeing Soviet troops who had landed at Maoka (now Kholmsk) claimed that the Koreans were cooperating with the Red Army and that they were pillaging Japanese property. Though Koreans and Japanese worked alongside each other in the village on farms and construction projects, the Japanese civilians turned against their Korean neighbors, killing 27 between August 20 and 23. Other individual Koreans may have been killed to cover up evidence of Japanese atrocities committed during the evacuation: one woman interviewed by a US-Russian joint commission investigating the issue of Allied prisoners of war held by the Imperial Japanese Army in camps on Sakhalin reported that her ethnic Korean lover had been murdered by Japanese troops after he had witnessed mass shootings of hundreds of American prisoners of war.\n\nIn the years after the Soviet invasion, most of the 400,000 Japanese civilians who had not already been evacuated during the war left voluntarily under the auspices of the US-USSR Agreement on Repatriation of those left in the USSR, signed in December 1946. Many of the 150,000 Koreans on the island safely returned to mainland Japan, and some went to the northern half of the Korean peninsula; however, roughly 43,000 were not accepted for repatriation by Japan, and also could not be repatriated to the southern half of the Korean peninsula due to the political situation; The Soviet government initially had drawn up plans to repatriate the Koreans along with the Japanese, but the local administration on Sakhalin objected, arguing that incoming Russians from the mainland would not be sufficient to replace the skilled labourers who had already departed. The indecision about the ultimate fate of the Sakhalin Koreans persisted until the outbreak of the Korean War, after which repatriation became a political impossibility. Some sources claim Stalin himself blocked their departure because he wanted to retain them as coal miners on the island. In 1957, Seoul appealed for Tokyo's assistance to secure the departure of ethnic Koreans from Sakhalin via Japan, but Tokyo took no real action on the request, and blamed Soviet intransigence for the lack of progress in resolving the issue; Japan continued its earlier policy of granting entrance only to Sakhalin Koreans who were married to Japanese citizens, or had a Japanese parent.\n\nDuring the late 1940s, the ranks of ethnic Koreans on the island were augmented by another 8,000 North Korean expatriates, recruited by the Soviet government to work in state-owned fisheries.\n\nIn an effort to integrate the Korean labourers, who were unfamiliar with the Soviet system and unable to speak Russian, local authorities set up schools using the Korean language as the medium of instruction. However, the Sakhalin Koreans were believed to have been \"infected with the Japanese spirit\", and so for the most part the authorities did not trust them to run any of their own collective farms, mills, factories, schools, or hospitals. Instead, these tasks were left to several hundred ethnic Koreans imported from Central Asia, who were bilingual in Russian and Korean. Resentment towards the social dominance of Koreans from Central Asia over the Sakhalin Koreans led to tensions between the two groups; the latter developed a number of disparaging terms in Korean to refer to the former.\n\nThe Sakhalin government's policy towards the Sakhalin Koreans continued to shift in line with bilateral relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union. During the 1950s, North Korea demanded that the Soviets treat Sakhalin Koreans as North Korean citizens, and, through their consulate, even set up study groups and other educational facilities for them (analogous to Chongryon's similar, more successful efforts among the Zainichi Koreans). During the late 1950s, it became increasingly difficult for the Sakhalin Koreans to obtain Soviet citizenship, and a growing proportion chose instead to become North Korean citizens rather to than deal with the burdens of remaining stateless, which included severe restrictions on their freedom of movement and the requirement to apply for permission from the local government in order to travel outside of Sakhalin. As of 1960, only 25% had been able to secure Soviet citizenship; 65% had declared North Korean citizenship, with the remaining 10% choosing to remain unaffiliated despite the difficulties this entailed. However, as relations between the Soviet Union and North Korea deteriorated, the authorities acted to de-emphasise Korean language education and reduce the influence of North Korea within the community; by the early 1970s, Sakhalin Koreans were once again encouraged to apply for Soviet citizenship.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the situation of the Sakhalin Koreans improved as the outside world began to pay much more attention to their situation. Starting in 1966, Park No Hak, a former Sakhalin Korean who had earlier received permission to leave Sakhalin and settle in Japan by virtue of his having a Japanese wife, petitioned the Japanese government a total of 23 times to discuss the issue of the Sakhalin Koreans with the Soviet government. His actions inspired 500,000 South Koreans to form an organisation to work towards the repatriation of their co-ethnics; in response, the South Korean began radio broadcasts targeted at the Sakhalin Koreans, in an effort to assure them that they had not been forgotten. At the same time, Rei Mihara, a Tokyo housewife, formed a similar pressure group in Japan, and 18 Japanese lawyers attempted to sue the Japanese government to force them to accept diplomatic and financial responsibility for the transportation of the Sakhalin Koreans and their return to South Korea.\n\nAdditionally, the Soviet government finally began to permit the Sakhalin Koreans to naturalize. However, as many as 10% continued to refuse both Soviet and North Korean citizenship, and demanded repatriation to South Korea. By 1976, only 2,000 more of their population had been able to obtain permission to depart from Sakhalin, but that year, the Sakhalin government made a public announcement that people seeking to emigrate to South Korea could simply show up at the Immigration Office to file an application. Within a week, they had received more than 800 such applications, including some from North Korean citizens; this caused the North Korean embassy to complain to their Soviet counterparts about the new emigration policy. The Soviet authorities in the end chose for unspecified reasons to refuse to issue exit visas to most of those concerned, leading to the unusual case of public demonstrations about the refusals by Korean families. This level of open dissent provoked the authorities to completely reverse their liberalising stance towards the Sakhalin Koreans; they arrested more than 40 protestors, and in November 1976 deported them, but to North Korea rather than to the South as they desired. Further purges and intimidation of those seeking to emigrate also followed. Through to the early 1980s, locally born Korean youth, increasingly interested in their heritage, were seen as traitors by their Russian neighbours for wanting to know more about their ancestral land and for seeking to emigrate. The nadir of ethnic relations came after the 1983 shooting-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1985, Japan agreed to approve transit rights and fund the repatriation of the first generation of Sakhalin Koreans; the Soviet Union also began to liberalize their emigration laws in 1987. As of 2001, Japan spends US$1.2 million a year to fund Sakhalin Koreans' visits to Seoul. The Foreign Ministry allocated about $5 million to build a cultural centre in Sakhalin, which was intended to feature a library, an exhibition hall, Korean language classrooms, and other facilities, but , the project had not begun, causing protests among the Sakhalin Koreans.\n\nOn April 18, 1990, Taro Nakayama, Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated:\n\nThe foreign trade of Sakhalin with Japan is still roughly four times that with Korea, and Japanese companies greatly outnumber their Korean on the island. As a result, while members of the first generation still carry anti-Japanese sentiment, the younger generations have developed an interest in Japanese culture and have taken up the study of the Japanese language, much to the consternation of their elders. On October 28, 2006, a Korean student from the Sakhalin State University placed second in the All-CIS Japanese Language Students Competition.\n\nDuring the 1990s, commerce, communication, and direct flights opened up between Sakhalin and South Korea, and the two Koreas began to vie openly for influence among the Sakhalin Koreans. Television and radio programmes from both North and South Korea, as well as local programming, began to be broadcast on Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting, the only Korean television station in all of Russia. North Korea negotiated with Russia for closer economic relations with Sakhalin, and sponsored an art show in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in 2006. They have also permitted delegations of Sakhalin Koreans to visit relatives in North Korea. Scholarly studies suggest that roughly 1,000 Sakhalin Koreans have opted to repatriate to North Korea, but the rise of the South Korean economy combined with the ongoing economic and political turmoil in the North have made this option less attractive. Sakhalin Koreans have also provided assistance to refugees fleeing North Korea, either those who illegally escaped across the border, or those who escaped North Korean labour camps in Russia itself.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan jointly funded the building of a nursing home for elderly Sakhalin Koreans in Ansan, a suburb of Seoul, and under the auspices of the Korean Red Cross, 1,544 people had settled there and in other locations , while another 14,122 had travelled to South Korea on short-term visits at Japanese government expense. South Korean investors also began to participate in the international tenders for works contracts to develop the Sakhalin Shelf, as they are interested in the potential supply of liquefied natural gas. By the year 2000, South Korean missionaries had opened several churches, and South Koreans comprised the majority of international students at the Sakhalin State University. The Korean Residents' Association on Sakhalin, an ethnic representative body, is generally described as being pro-South Korean, analogous to Japan's Mindan. In addition to the elderly, a few younger Koreans have also chosen to move to South Korea, either to find their roots, or for economic reasons, as wages in South Korea are as much as three times those in Sakhalin. However, upon arrival, they often find that they are viewed as foreigners by the South Korean locals, despite their previous exposure to Korean culture in Sakhalin. As one returnee put it, \"Sakhalin Koreans live in a different world than Sakhalin Russians but that world isn’t Korea\". In general, younger Sakhalin Koreans, especially those lacking fluency in the Korean language, prefer to stay on Sakhalin. Of the 1,544 Koreans who repatriated to South Korea , nearly 10% eventually returned to Sakhalin. Conversely, some foreign students from Korea studying in Sakhalin also reported difficulties in befriending local Koreans, claiming that the latter looked down on them for being foreigners.\n\nIn the late 1980s, suspicions against the Sakhalin Koreans remained. With the relaxation of internal migration controls and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russians began moving \"en masse\" back to the mainland, making ethnic Koreans an increasing proportion of the population; there were fears that they might become a majority of the island's population, and seek an autonomous republic or even independence. However, the rise of the regional economy and the cultural assimilation of the younger generations drove more than 95% of Koreans to stay in Sakhalin or move to the Russian Far East rather than leave for South Korea, as they have come to consider Russia their home country. The Sakhalin Koreans' family connections in South Korea have benefited even those who remained on Sakhalin with easier access to South Korean business and imports; trade with South Korea has brought the Sakhalin Koreans a better economic standing than the average resident of Sakhalin. By 2004, inter-ethnic relations between Russians and Koreans had improved greatly and were generally not described as being a problem on Sakhalin. However, Sakhalin Koreans who have travelled to the mainland of Russia, or have relocated to there (a population of roughly 10,000), report that they have encountered various forms of racism.\n\nAmong the Koreans who remain on Sakhalin, roughly 7,000 of the original generation of settlers survive, while their locally born descendants make up the rest of the local Korean population. They are highly urbanized; half live in the administrative centre of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, where Koreans constitute nearly 12% of the population. Around thirty per cent of Sakhalin’s thirty thousand Koreans still have not taken Russian citizenship.\nUnlike ethnic Russians or other local minority groups, Sakhalin Koreans are exempted from conscription, but there have been calls for this exemption to be terminated.\n\nKorean surnames, when Cyrillized, may be spelled slightly differently from the romanisations used in the US; the resulting common pronunciations also differ, as can be seen in the table at right. Furthermore, Korean naming practices and Russian naming practices conflict in several important ways. While most members of the older generations of Sakhalin Koreans used Korean names, members of the younger generations favor their Russian names. However, with the increasing exposure to South Korean pop culture, some younger Koreans have named their children after characters in Korean television dramas. The use of patronymics is not widespread.\n\nIn addition to Korean names, the oldest generation of Sakhalin Koreans are often legally registered under Japanese names, which they had originally adopted due to the \"sōshi-kaimei\" policy of the Japanese colonial era. After the Soviet invasion, the Sakhalin authorities conducted name registration for the local Koreans on the basis of the Japanese identity documents issued by the old Karafuto government; as of 2006, the Russian government uniformly refused requests for re-registration under Korean names.\n\nDue to their greater population density and expectation that they would one day be allowed to return to Korea, the Sakhalin Koreans have kept something of a sojourner mentality rather than a settler mentality, which influenced their relation to the surrounding society; even today, they tend to speak much better Korean than those who were deported to Central Asia. A weekly Korean language newspaper, the \"Saegoryeo Shinmun\" (새고려 신문), has been published since 1949, while Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting began operation in 1956. Korean-language television programmes are broadcast locally, but typically with Russian subtitles. Additionally, during the Soviet era, Sakhalin Koreans were often hired to act as announcers and writers for official media aimed at the Koryo-saram in Central Asia. However, unlike the Koryo-saram, the spoken Korean of Sakhalin is not very closely related to Hamgyŏng dialect or Koryo-mar, but is instead descended from Jeolla and Gyeongsang dialects. As a result of the diplomatic situation up until the 1980s, during which South Korea had no relations with the Soviet Union, Korean-language instructional materials were provided by North Korea or developed domestically. Oddly enough, as a result, Sakhalin Koreans' writing, like that of Koryo-saram, follows the North Korean standard, but their spoken Korean in radio broadcasts has come to resemble the Seoul dialect of South Korea.\n\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there has been significant growth in religious activities among the Sakhalin Koreans; the establishment of churches was noted in scholarly articles as early as 1990. Christian hymns have become popular listening material, supplementing the more typical Russian, Western, and Korean pop music. Korean churches also broadcast religious content through Sakhalin Korean Broadcasting; a Baptist church run by ethnic Koreans sponsors a journalist there. However, large-scale religious events can be subjected to restriction by the government authorities: in June 1998 the local Russian Orthodox Church and the regional administration of Sakhalin successfully pressured Korean Presbyterian missionaries to cancel a conference of more than 100 Presbyterian and other Protestant missionaries from around the former Soviet Union.\nEthnic Koreans are numerous among the church-goers of St. James Cathedral, seat of the Apostolic Prefecture of Yuzhno Sakhalinsk, in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Catholic missions in Kholmsk and Aniva have also a fair number of Korean parishioners.\n\nIn one survey, a third of the Sakhalin Korean population expressed a preference for traditional Korean music, a far higher proportion than in any other ethnic Korean community surveyed. However, despite their better knowledge of Korean language, the same survey showed that Korean pop music is less widespread among Sakhalin Koreans than among ethnic Koreans in Kazakhstan, possessing about the same degree of popularity as in Uzbekistan. Sakhalin Koreans also reported listening to Western popular and classical music at much lower rates than Koreans in the rest of the former Soviet Union. Study of traditional Korean musical instruments has also been gaining popularity across all generations. The Ethnos Arts School was established in 1991 in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to teach children's classes in traditional Korean dance, piano, sight singing, and the \"gayageum\", a zither-like instrument supposedly invented around the time of the Gaya confederacy.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the grandson of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, a British MP and social reformer, and the son of Sir Edward North Buxton, also an MP.\n\nHe attended Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He married Lady Victoria Noel on 12 June 1862 and they had a total of 13 children, ten surviving infancy. She was crippled by a spinal condition in 1869.\n\nHe was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for King's Lynn at the 1865 general election, but was defeated at the 1868 election. After his defeat, he stood again for Parliament unsuccessfully on several other occasions: in Westminster at the 1874 general election, in Western Essex at the 1880 general election and at the by-elections in Northern Norfolk in 1876 and 1879. He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1876.\n\nWhen Buxton was appointed governor, the Premier of South Australia, Charles Kingston was angry that the South Australian government had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's invalid carriage). Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor. He eventually returned to England due to the ill health of his wife.\n\nTheir second son, Noel Buxton acted as aide-de-camp to his father as governor, and later was a human rights campaigner and British Member of Parliament.\n\nA memorial to Sir Thomas and his wife Victoria was erected in St Thomas' Church in Upshire in Essex in 1917, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8414200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8414200", "title": "The Heathen Chinee", "text": "The Heathen Chinee\n\n\"The Heathen Chinee\", originally published as \"Plain Language from Truthful James\", is a narrative poem by American writer Bret Harte. It was published for the first time in September 1870 in the \"Overland Monthly\". It was written as a parody of Algernon Charles Swinburne's \"Atalanta in Calydon\" (1865), and satirized anti-Chinese sentiment in northern California.\n\nThe poem became popular and was frequently republished. To Harte's dismay, however, the poem reinforced racism among his readers instead of challenging it as he intended. Nevertheless, he returned to the character years later. The poem also inspired or influenced several adaptations.\n\nThe narrative of the poem focuses on a Chinese immigrant character named Ah Sin who is playing the card game euchre with two white men on August 3 of an unspecified year. \"Truthful James\", one of the men who narrates the poem, observes that the other white man, Bill Nye, is cheating with a stacked deck, and with cards up his sleeve. They both seemed to think Ah Sin was childlike and did not understand the game. Nevertheless, Ah Sin plays well and soon puts down the same card that Nye had dealt to the narrator. Concluding their opponent is \"also\" cheating, Nye fights Ah Sin and discovers he has several decks hidden in his clothes.\n\nMark Twain later recalled that Harte initially wrote the poem \"for his own amusement\", without intending to publish it. According to Twain, he \"threw it aside, but being one day suddenly called upon for copy he sent that very piece in.\" In writing the poem, Harte echoed and, therefore, lampooned Algernon Charles Swinburne's 1865 verse tragedy \"Atalanta in Calydon\". Ambrose Bierce claimed Harte originally sent it to him to include in his San Francisco-based \"News Letter\", but he suggested it was better suited for Harte's own journal, the \"Overland Monthly\". It appeared there under its original title, \"Plain Language from Truthful James\" in the September 1870 issue. Its adapted name, \"The Heathen Chinee\", (though it echoed Harte's phrases \"the heathen Chinee\" and \"that heathen Chinee\" in the poems text) became a title in a republication in a Boston newspaper in 1871.\n\nThe poem was republished several times within a short period, including in \"New York Evening Post\", \"Prairie Farmer\", \"New York Tribune\", \"Boston Evening Transcript\", \"Providence Journal\", \"Hartford Courant\", and \"Saturday Evening Post\" (published twice). The poem was also included in a book by Harte titled \"Poems\", released in January 1871. Several periodicals and books would republish the poem with illustrations. \n\nIn April 1870, James Thomas Fields had published a collection of Harte's stories, \"The Luck of Roaring Camp and Other Sketches\" through the Fields, Osgood, & Co. imprint.After the sudden success of \"The Heathen Chinee\", Fields rushed a to produce a collection of Harte's poetry in time for the Christmas market. That book sold out of its first six editions in five days.\n\nThe character of Ah Sin was revived for a theatrical play co-written by Harte and Twain, \"Ah Sin\". The two writers had a rift by February 1877 just before completing a final draft. Twain took over the project and, as he wrote to William Dean Howells, he \"left hardly a foot-print of Harte in it\". Harte nevertheless attended the play's opening at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. on May 7, 1877.\n\nNear the end of his life, Harte used the characters of both Truthful James and Ah Sin in his poem \"Free Silver at Angel's\", a satirical response to the silver plank in the 1896 Democratic National Convention platform. Even so, when asked about the original poem in later years, Harte called the poem \"trash\", and \"the worst poem I ever wrote, possibly the worst poem anyone ever wrote.\"\n\n\"Plain Language from Truthful James\" (or \"The Heathen Chinee\") was very popular among general readers. One New York newspaper reported on the frenzy over the poem: \"Strolling down Broadway... we saw a crowd of men and boys, of high and low degree, swarming about a shop-window, pushing, laughing, and struggling... Elbowing our way through the crowd, we discovered an illustrated copy of Bret Harte's poem 'The Heathen Chinee.'\"\n\nThe poem's popularity came, in part, from the ambiguity over its race-related message. The narrator implies that the cheating of the Chinese man was no worse than that of the white man, but the irony was too subtle for general readers. The message matched one Harte had written elsewhere in exposing white people's hypocrisy. As he wrote later, the Chinese \"did as the Caucasian did in all respects, and, being more patient and frugal, did it a little better\". Harte repeatedly opposed anti-Asian discrimination since as early as 1863, both privately and publicly. In 1866, for example, he wrote a letter defending the \"peaceable citizens\" of San Francisco's Chinatown who were \"patient under abuse, and that patience, I am ashamed to say, they have to exercise continually in California\". After the discovery of a murdered woman in Chinatown, whose cause of death was uncertain, Harte wrote, \"as her head was caved in it is thought by some physicians that she died of galloping Christianity of the malignant California type\".\n\nIn this vein, Harte intended \"Plain Language from Truthful James\" to be a satire of the prevalent prejudice among Irish laborers in northern California against the Chinese immigrants competing for the same work. However, the predominantly white middle-class readership of the \"Overland\" and the periodicals that reprinted it interpreted and embraced the poem as mocking the Chinese. These immigrants had been drawn in by the California Gold Rush and a boom in labor jobs, but relations with American-born citizens were tense. The more recent economic downturn in California had made tensions even worse. Readers took certain phrases of the poem out of context, including \"we are ruined by Chinese cheap labor!\", and used the poem to reinforce their own racism.\n\nThe poem was also frequently parodied. The poem \"Three Aces\", signed \"Carl Byng\", was published in the \"Buffalo Express\" in December 1870, not long after \"Plain Language from Truthful James\" first appeared. The poem was widely attributed to Mark Twain and labeled a \"feeble imitation\" of Harte. Twain angrily denied the charge and demanded a retraction, writing to the editor Thomas Bailey Aldrich, \"I am not in the imitation business\". Harte, in turn, targeted Twain years later in his 1893 story \"Ingénue of the Sierras\" by creating an unsavory character named \"Charley Bing\", modeled after Twain. The incident was one of several in a long rivalry between the two authors. In 1898, \"The Overland Monthly\" ran a poem making fun of Harte himself, who had moved to Europe in 1871 and never returned, for forgetting what life was like in the west.\n\n\"The Heathen Chinee\", as the poem was most often called, was recited in public among opponents to Chinese immigration, and Eugene Casserly, a Senator from California who was \"vehemently opposed to the admission of Chinese labour\", apparently thanked Harte in writing for supporting his cause. The confusion was furthered by the altered title, which allowed for a more literal reading, and the illustrations in later republications. Harte's poem shaped the popular American conception of the Chinese more than any other writing at the time, and made him the most popular literary figure in America in 1870. The poem was especially relevant to Harte's fame as his other popular works \"The Luck of Roaring Camp\" and \"The Outcasts of Poker Flat\" which were originally published without the author's name.\n\nIt inspired a series of west coast songwriters, for example, to produce songs which looked at Chinese immigrants through negative stereotypes and questioned their place in America. Some used Harte's poem word-for-word. In November 1875, Union Porcelain Works in Long Island announced the release of a pitcher decorated with figures from \"The Heathen Chinee\". The title character was depicted with four aces falling from his sleeve.\n\nThe influence continued for decades and spread into other authors' writings. In 1895, for example, Adeline Knapp published her short story \"The Ways That Are Dark\", quoting a line from the poem. In 1931, Earl Derr Biggers considered the same quote from the poem as a title for his sixth Charlie Chan novel, inspired by a movie studio executive's suggestion, \"Incidentally, could you use the Bret Harte—heathen Chinee phrase of 'Ways that are dark' as a possible title for some forthcoming exploits?\" Ralph Townsend used the same line for his anti-Chinese book \"Ways That Are Dark\".\n\n"}

By Turkish roots, this could mean roots linking back to Turkey, the island of Cyprus or the communities of the Turkish diaspora.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Irish census, there are 1,029 Turkish nationals living in Ireland. During the time of a 2005 strike against the GAMA Turkish Construction Company, socialist news websites reported that they alone employed 900 to 2,000 Turkish workers. The Turkish embassy may have an investment in down-playing the number of Turks in Ireland given the negative reception of Turks in other European countries, such as German Turks, Dutch-Turks and French-Turks. Thus, overall the number of Turkish descendants living in Ireland is estimated at 2,000-3,000.\n\n\n\n\n"}
