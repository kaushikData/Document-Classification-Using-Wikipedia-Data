The United States Attorney General simultaneously announced the unsealing of the indictments and the prior guilty pleas by four football executives and two corporations.\n\nThe investigation mostly revolved around collusion between officials of continental football bodies CONMEBOL (South America) and CONCACAF (Caribbean, Central and North America), and sports marketing executives. The sports marketing executives were holders of media and marketing rights for high-profile international competitions including the Americas' FIFA World Cup qualifying tournaments, and showpiece tournaments CONCACAF Gold Cup and Copa América.\n\nCONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb, also serving president of the Cayman Islands Football Association, was arrested in connection with the investigation, as were two sitting FIFA Executive Committee members: Eduardo Li of the Costa Rican Football Federation and Eugenio Figueredo, formerly of the Uruguayan Football Association, and former CONMEBOL President Nicolás Leoz. The investigation lasted several years, with the first arrest, of former CONCACAF president Jack Warner's son Daryll, made in July 2013.\n\nIn total, seven current FIFA officials were arrested at the Hotel Baur au Lac in Zürich on 27 May. They were preparing to attend the 65th FIFA Congress, which was scheduled to include the election of the president of FIFA. They are expected to be extradited to the United States on suspicion of receiving in bribes. There was also a simultaneous raid on the CONCACAF headquarters in Miami, and later, two further men handed themselves in to police for arrest: Jack Warner and marketing executive Alejandro Burzaco. Two further arrests of FIFA officials at the hotel occurred in December 2015.\n\nThe arrests case triggered Australia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany and Switzerland to open or intensify separate criminal investigations into top FIFA officials for corruption.\n\nThe 2015 arrests centre on the alleged use of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights for FIFA games in the Americas, estimated at $150 million, including at least $110 million in bribes related to the Copa América Centenario to be hosted in 2016 in the United States. In addition, the indictment handed down by the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that bribery was used in an attempt to influence clothing sponsorship contracts, the selection process for the 2010 FIFA World Cup host, and the 2011 FIFA presidential election. Specifically, an unnamed sports equipment company – identified in multiple sources as Nike, Inc. – is alleged to have paid at least $40 million in bribes to become the sole provider of uniforms, footwear, accessories, and equipment to the Brazil national team.\n\nIn December 2010, federal law enforcement agents secured the undercover cooperation of American football executive and CONCACAF official Chuck Blazer. The FBI's New York office had begun its probe as a spin-off of an unrelated organised crime investigation, and in August 2011, IRS-CI's Los Angeles office began investigating Blazer's alleged failure to file personal income tax returns. In December 2011, IRS-CI became aware of what the FBI was up to from news reports and the two offices began a joint investigation of Blazer. They were investigating Blazer's involvement in the bidding process for host countries for the FIFA World Cups from the early 1990s onwards. (The United States is one of two countries that broadly exercise worldwide jurisdiction to tax the net income of its citizens from any source in the world; it also requires taxpayers to report and pay tax on illegal income, and exercises worldwide jurisdiction over all financial institutions with U.S.-based account holders.) Blazer agreed to cooperate almost immediately after two agents approached him in New York and confronted him with proof of his tax crimes.\n\nIn December 2010, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup was discussed.\n\nIn November 2013, Blazer pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges including wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and offenses involving income tax and banking. Blazer's guilty plea had aimed to stave off a more serious charge of racketeering, which carried a potential 20-year prison sentence. Blazer would later make secret recordings of meetings with FIFA officials, and allegedly carried a recording device concealed in a key ring during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The information against Blazer (the charging document used in lieu of an indictment for a plea bargain) was revealed on 27 May 2015, the same day that the arrests were made in Zurich.\n\nIn 2011, Phaedra Al-Majid, who was part of the successful 2022 Qatari World Cup Bid, came forward as a whistle-blower. She claimed that Qatar paid $1.5 million to African Football Confederation president Issa Hayatou, Ivory Coast FIFA member Jacques Anouma and Nigeria's suspended official Amos Adamu to vote for Qatar; all three denied the allegations. She later stated that she had fabricated her claims for media attention. Al-Majid co-operated with the Garcia Report. In November 2014, she stated that she was coerced into withdrawing her allegations as she feared for her safety and due to her lack of legal representation. As of June 2015, she was in FBI protective custody, when she stated, \"The FBI have everything... There are people who are annoyed with me [for speaking out], and what really irks them is that I'm a female, Muslim whistleblower... I just don't think Blatter actually intends to quit. Everything he does is very calculated. He'll try very hard to save himself, I'm sure of it.\"\n\nIn May 2011, \"The Sunday Times\" published claims from a whistle-blower that President of CAF Issa Hayatou had, along with fellow Executive Committee member Jacques Anouma, accepted $1.5 million bribes from Qatar to secure his support for their bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn 2013, former FIFA President João Havelange and the Brazilian Football Confederation President Ricardo Teixeira were both found to have taken bribes worth millions of dollars. FIFA executive committee member was sanctioned with a lifetime ban for bribery and corruption.\n\nIn the wake of the corruption case, it was reported that in 2008 the general secretary of FIFA, Jérôme Valcke was alleged to have transferred $10 million that had been given to FIFA by Danny Jordaan, president of the South African Football Association, to accounts controlled by Jack Warner, then head of CONCACAF. The payment is a key piece of the American prosecutors' indictment that accuses Warner of taking a bribe in exchange for helping South Africa secure the right to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The payment from the South African Football Association had been intended to support the development of football in the Caribbean. $1.6 million of the South African payment was used by Warner to pay personal loans and credit cards and a further $360,000 was withdrawn by people connected to Warner. The Trinidadian supermarket chain JTA Supermarkets also received $4,860,000 from the FIFA payment.\n\nThe FBI also investigating the 2014 World Cup.\n\nThe Department of Justice has not charged anybody at FIFA with bribery. Prosecutors have instead alleged racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracies under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) Act, which was intended for use against the Mafia. In addition, officials have been charged with violations of the Travel Act. The relevant part of the law essentially says that it is illegal to engage in interstate or foreign travel, or use the mails or \"any facility in interstate commerce\" to promote, manage, establish or carry on an illegal activity. That activity can be illegal under either federal or state law. Bribery is definitely included on the list of what is considered an illegal activity under the Travel Act. Any relevant transaction, even if it is only tangentially related to America, can be targeted. In one instance, a representative of First Caribbean International Bank in the Bahamas flew to New York to pick up a cheque for $250,000 (the alleged bribe) from the bribe recipient to transport it safely back to the defendant's bank account.\n\nFIFA commissioned former United States Attorney Michael J. Garcia to investigate and report on the bidding processes behind the awarding of the 2018 FIFA World Cup to Russia and the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar. In November 2014, FIFA made a copy of Garcia's report available to the Attorney General of Switzerland, who then stated that there were \"grounds for suspicion that, in isolated cases, international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland took place which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities\".\nSepp Blatter had been president of FIFA since 1998 (until his removal in December 2015). \"The Guardian\" said that FIFA's actions would \"... inevitably be viewed with cynicism given Blatter's track record of using the Swiss courts and FIFA's regulatory processes to kick problematic issues into the long grass and deflect attention onto individuals who have already left football\".\n\nIn May 2015, on the same day as the arrests resulting from the FBI's investigation and in a separate action, the Swiss prosecuting authorities launched a criminal inquiry on \"suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering\" concerning the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes. The Swiss authorities seized \"electronic data and documents\" in a raid on FIFA's Zürich headquarters. The Swiss police also planned to question ten members of the FIFA Executive Committee who participated in the December 2010 votes that chose the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 world cups.\n\nIn September 2015, Switzerland was investigating a payment Blatter authorised in 2011 to the president of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Michel Platini for work done between 1999 and 2002. They also launched an investigation of possible \"criminal mismanagement\" by Blatter in a 2005 TV rights deal he signed with Jack Warner.\n\nIn March 2017 FIFA submitted 1300 pages of reports to the Swiss Attorney General's office. The investigation is expected to take up to 5 years to complete.\n\nIn September 2015, Swiss public television channel SRF published that Blatter would have sold the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup rights in North America for US$600,000, a small fraction of their market value.\n\nTorneos & Traffic (T&T) is a subsidiary of Fox International Channels since 2005 (with investments since 2002) is the same company involved in corrupt practices in the acquisition of rights to major South American football tournaments.\n\nA total of 18 individuals and two corporations have been indicted, including nine FIFA officials and five businessmen.\n\nThe December indictment included the following 16 individuals:\n\nIn 2001, FIFA affiliate International Sports and Leisure went bankrupt in what were viewed in some circles as suspicious circumstances. In 2002 a FIFA whistleblower contacted British journalist Andrew Jennings relating to alleged corruption within FIFA itself.\n\nFollowing investigations Swiss magistrate Thomas Hildbrand seized documents from FIFA offices in 2005 and in 2007 Jennings published a book – \"Foul\" – and broadcast the BBC \"Panorama\" documentary \"The Beautiful Bung: Corruption and the World Cup\". \"Panorama\" later aired the \"Fifa and Co\" documentary in 2007, which contained an allegation of soliciting a bribe against Jack Warner and a court judgement that Jérôme Valcke had lied in FIFA business dealings. These reports led the FBI to contact Jennings in 2009.\n\nOn 29 November 2010 the BBC broadcast \"FIFA's Dirty Secrets\", a second documentary by Jennings. This was aired just days before the results of the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids in Zurich, Switzerland. Following the bidding process, FIFA announced that Russia and Qatar had won the rights to stage the 2018 and 2022 World Cups respectively. The result immediately caused controversies, as Russia is accused of a high level of racism in football and because of its involvement in the Ukrainian crisis. After it was announced that Russia would host 2018 FIFA World Cup, Dr Rafał Pankowski, a head of UEFA FARE Monitoring Centre, accused the Russian Football Union of downplaying racist chants in stadiums. The annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 led to several British and American politicians calling on FIFA to overturn its decision of hosting the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Criticism from a number of media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups also highlighted problems such as Qatar's limited football history, the high expected cost, the local climate, and Qatar's human rights record. Since in summer temperature will reach more than 50 °C (122 °F) in Qatar, it was announced on 24 February 2015 that a winter world cup would go ahead in favour of the traditional summertime event.\n\nIn 2011, former MI6 spy Christopher Steele began providing information and sources to the FBI, which helped advance the investigation.\n\nIn May 2011 a whistleblower, later revealed to be Phaedra Almajid who was a member of the Qatari bid team for the 2022 World Cup, claimed that money was paid to FIFA's executive committee in order to buy votes. However, she retracted these claims in July 2011, later claiming that she had been coerced into making these retractions.\n\nOn May 2013, former CONCACAF executive Chuck Blazer was arrested (and later indicted) on bribery charges. Jack Warner and Blazer were suspended from FIFA at around the same time. Then on 17 October 2014 FIFA announced that the Garcia Report into alleged bribery during the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids could not be released in full for legal reasons. Garcia later claimed that a summary of the report that \"was\" released misrepresents his findings.\n\nOn the morning of 27 May 2015, seven FIFA officials were arrested just before the start of the 65th FIFA Congress. Two days later Sepp Blatter comfortably defeated Prince Ali bin Hussein to remain as President of FIFA. David Gill threatened to resign his newly elected role as FIFA Vice-President and member of the FIFA Executive Committee.\n\nLater on 27 May, former FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner surrendered himself to police in his native Trinidad, where a court granted him bail. He spent a night in custody while bail was processed.\nOn 31 May he posted a self-defence video on his Facebook page in which he proclaimed innocence while citing an article from satirical newspaper \"The Onion\". However, on 3 June and following both the resignation of Sepp Blatter and the revelations of the former FIFA Executive Chuck Blazer, Warner declared in a televised political address that he was no longer prepared to \"keep secrets for them who actively seek to destroy the country\" (Trinidad and Tobago) and that the \"gloves [were] off\". He also claimed to have \"compiled a comprehensive and detailed series of documents including cheques and corroborating statements\" which he said revealed his \"knowledge about certain transactions at FIFA including, but not limited to its president Sepp Blatter\". Claiming further that he feared for his life, he declared, \"(N)ot even death will stop the avalanche that is coming. The die is cast. There can be no turning back. Let the chips fall where they fall.\" l\n\nThe existence of a U.S. federal investigation and grand jury based in Brooklyn was first made public in November 2014 by The New York Daily News.\n\nOn 27 May 2015, during the FIFA annual meeting at the Baur au Lac hotel in Zurich, authorities charged 14 officials, including nine current or former FIFA executives, including FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb. All faced extradition to the United States. On the same day, the Swiss attorney general's office said that other FIFA executives were being questioned on suspicion of \"criminal mismanagement\" and money laundering.\n\nOn 2 June 2015 a letter was published, claiming that Jérôme Valcke was party to a potential bribe paid to former FIFA executive Jack Warner in relation to votes for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Despite his win just four days previously, Sepp Blatter announced his resignation as FIFA President. \n\nThe following day, South Africa sports minister Fikile Mbalula denied the $10 million payment to Warner was a bribe.\n\nLater that day, the FBI unsealed the transcript of the allocution made by former FIFA member and head of CONCACAF, Chuck Blazer which he had made when he pleaded guilty in 2013 to various charges as part of an apparent plea bargain. In Blazer's partially-redacted allocution, he claimed that he \"and others, while acting in our official capacities, agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud FIFA and CONCACAF of the right to honest services by taking undisclosed bribes\" and that he had \"agreed with others in or around 1992 to facilitate the acceptance of a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the 1998 World Cup. I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup\".\n\nOn 6 June, Phaedra Almajid, who had been placed under the protective custody of the FBI, claimed that FIFA would be forced to strip Qatar from hosting the 2022 World Cup.\n\nOn 9 June, Italian-Argentinian Alejandro Burzaco was arrested in Italy. The two remaining Argentinian businessmen indicted, Hugo Jinkis and Mariano Jinkis, surrendered to a court in Buenos Aires on 18 June.\n\nOn 17 September 2015, FIFA stated that Jérôme Valcke had been put on leave and released from his duties until further notice. The decision was made by the FIFA Emergency Committee after a series of allegations implicated Valcke of selling World Cup tickets for above face value.\n\nOn 25 September, criminal proceedings were started against Blatter by Swiss prosecutors on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation. Blatter denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOn 8 October 2015, FIFA President Sepp Blatter, Secretary General Jerome Valcke and UEFA President Michel Platini were suspended for 80 days by FIFA's Ethics Committee. Blatter appealed the suspension but lost the appeal on 18 November 2015.\n\nGerman police searched the headquarters of the German Football Association over allegations of illegal deals before the 2006 World Cup. The head of president of the German Football Association, Wolfgang Niersbach, resigned. Marco Polo del Nero of Brazil, president of the Brazilian football federation announced his resignation from FIFA Executive Committee on 26 November 2015.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, FIFA vice-presidents Alfredo Hawit and Juan Angel Napout were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May 2015. Hours later, the U.S. Department of Justice revealed an additional 16 indictments for criminal schemes; as well, former CONCACAF president Jeffrey Webb pleaded guilty to money laundering, wire fraud and racketeering.\n\nOn 21 December, the FIFA Ethics Committee banned both Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini for eight years from all football-related activity organised by FIFA after being found guilty of a £1.3 million ($2 million) \"disloyal payment\" made to Platini in 2011. Blatter said he would appeal the verdict.\n\nOn 9 January 2016, the FIFA Emergency Committee decided to dismiss Jérôme Valcke as FIFA Secretary General and to terminate his employment relationship.\n\nOn 26 February 2016, an extraordinary FIFA Congress was held and elected UEFA Secretary General Gianni Infantino as the new president of FIFA while also passing a major reform package.\n\nOn 29 May 2015 Sepp Blatter won re-election to the FIFA presidency at the 65th FIFA Congress in Zurich amid growing criticism over his position. Four days later, however, he announced that he would continue as president only until a new election would be conducted at a 2016 FIFA Extraordinary Congress on 26 February 2016. Blatter said that he would not be a candidate for election at that time. Blatter maintained \"I did not resign, I put myself and my office in the hands of the FIFA congress.\"\n\nUpon the decision of the FIFA Adjudicatory Chamber of the Independent Ethics Committee to provisionally ban Blatter, FIFA recognizes Issa Hayatou as the interim president of FIFA in accordance with article 32 (6) of the FIFA Statutes.\n\nOn 10 June 2015, FIFA announced that they would be delaying the 2026 FIFA World Cup bidding process, amidst allegations surrounding bribery in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes. Secretary general Valcke stated that \"Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being.\"\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice web site, the following defendants previously pleaded guilty under seal and agreed to forfeit more than $40 million.\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2015, four major FIFA sponsors, Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa and Budweiser, called for Blatter to stand down immediately as FIFA president.\n\nOn 12 June 2015, international law enforcement agency Interpol announced it was suspending a 20 million euro donation by FIFA to fund an anti-gambling and match fixing program. Four million euros was spent in the first two years on prevention and education and another 1.5 million euros was set to be spent in the remaining eight years.\n\nAn Interpol spokesman said, \"The agreement with FIFA includes a clause which states that 'the Funding Party declares notably that its activities are compatible with the principles, aims and activities of Interpol'. All external partners, whether public or private, must share the fundamental values and principles of the organisation, as well as the wider law enforcement community.\"\n\nFIFA said it was disappointed by the decision.\n\nThe donation for the 10-year Integrity in Sport program was originally accepted in 2011 by former Interpol Secretary-General Ronald Noble.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5540528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5540528", "title": "AIDS service organization", "text": "AIDS service organization\n\nAIDS service organizations are community-based organizations that provide support for people affected by HIV/AIDS. This article focuses on HIV/AIDS service organizations in the United States only.\n\nThere is a huge variety of these organizations in order to provide for the wide variety of needs of HIV/AIDS patients and their families. The majority of these organizations are healthcare-based, providing assistance with testing, treatment, preventative medicines like Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), needle and syringe exchanges and more. Another prominent type of AIDS service organization is education-based, working to raise awareness and public understanding of topics like the transmission of HIV, safe sex, treatment resources, as well as eliminating rampant misconceptions about HIV/AIDS. Other organizations provide services like legal advice and/or advocacy, mental health and counseling services, and fundraising and community outreach.\n\nThese organizations are vital in providing for patients needs, as well as reducing the economic impact of HIV/AIDS, strengthening global health, and countering the social and political imbalances which disproportionately impact HIV/AIDS patients.\n\nThe discovery of AIDS patients in the United States in the 1980s created a need for resources to be provided to patients and others affected by the disease. This is not unique to HIV/AIDS, there are organizations providing similar services for other diseases like and .\n\nMany HIV/AIDS organizations are expansions of previously-existing LGBTQ , which are present in 32 states and have evolved over time to serve the shifting needs of the LGBTQ community. These organizations were created to serve LGBTQ people's specific healthcare concerns as well as counteract the impact of social determinants, stigma, and bias. They readily adapted to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One example is the Los Angeles LGBT Center, the largest LGBT service organization in the world. But not all AIDS service organizations were first LGBT centers. One of the most prominent early AIDS-specific organizations was/is New York's Gay Men's Health Crisis.\n\nCommunity-based AIDS organizations also worked collaboratively with widespread activist efforts to demand federal and social support, recognition, and equality.\n\nThese organizations provide a wide array of services to match the wide array of need, which is attributable to the interconnectedness of healthcare with poverty and social issues.\n\nMedical services are the priority of most of these organizations, due to factors which prevent many HIV/AIDS patients from receiving adequate care from mainstream healthcare providers. These factors include real or perceived discrimination in healthcare facilities and insurance companies, lack of cultural competence among healthcare providers about LGBT issues, and patients not wanting to be associated with AIDS, and/or, in some cases, the LBGT community. This is still widely occurring today but was especially prevalent during the HIV/AIDS crisis. \"The optimal provision of health care and prevention services to sexual and gender minorities requires providers to be sensitive to historical stigmatization, to be informed about continued barriers to care and the differential prevalence of specific risk factors and health conditions in these populations, and to become aware of the cultural aspects of their interactions with LGBT patients.\" Especially during the AIDS crisis, this was just not reality and AIDS service organizations were forced to fill in the gap. AIDS organizations provide testing, treatment, symptom management, mental health services, and more.\n\nAdditionally, AIDS service organizations provide resources beyond medical services. \nThe lack of knowledge about AIDS and the resulting panic and misinformation was the motivating force behind many community service organizations who worked to provide education and dispel myths about the disease. This continues to be an enormous issue today and is one of the most important services AIDS organizations provides. They also can provide community health and wellness education, personal and family counseling, and sexually transmitted infection prevention awareness, safe sex materials, and legal advice and services.\n\nAIDS service organizations face the same obstacles that all health and social service organizations face: struggles for funding, labor, and resources, as well as the constant battle against a devastating illness. But there are many things which specifically hinder the efforts of AIDS organizations. HIV/AIDS \"plagues the world's most vulnerable people\" and they are highly dependent on service organizations due to marginalization, stigma, and fear of social and legal retribution, both currently but especially during the height of the AIDS crisis. \"Health disparities are very evident\" as HIV/AIDS patients are disproportionately MSM, transgender women, low-income, and/or people of color. HIV/AIDS also heavily impacts people suffering from IV drug addiction and/or homelessness. These are the people who are dependent on community centers and service organizations.\n\nThe AIDS crisis was shadowed by constant politicization which magnified the struggles of HIV/AIDS patients, as well as heavily hindered research and the search for treatment and/or a cure. The HIV virus wasn't discovered to be the cause of AIDS until 1984, and the first treatment, AZT, was not approved until 1987. So there were long periods of time following the emergence of HIV/AIDS in which there was no treatment, and community organizations could only focus on symptom management and social activism to push for a cure. Once treatment was discovered and approved, it was sold for an extraordinary price. In 1989, AZT was the most expensive prescription drug in history. Very few patients could afford to be treated or remain on the treatment for the long-term plan that was necessary to sufficiently lower patient's viral loads.\n\nMany AIDS organizations faced pushback from local communities as fear of GRID or the gay cancer was rampant and coupled with widespread political, legal, and social discrimination and homophobia. The case of Ryan White gained enormous media attention due to his experience with community alienation.\n\nThere was a huge disparity between resources depending on geographic location within the United States. Organizations stemming from pre-existing LGBT centers were really isolated to urban coastal spaces.\n\nCommunity-based health organizations, especially HIV/AIDS organizations are extremely dependent on volunteer labor. 21% of LGBT community organizations rely completely on volunteer labor, and 57% have fewer than five paid staff positions.\n\nAnother obstacle is the immediacy of need. HIV/AIDS is an infectious disease, therefore treatment is necessary both for the patients own health and wellbeing but also to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nService Organizations and HIV/AIDS Resources\n\n"}
{"id": "1139577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1139577", "title": "Agricultural show", "text": "Agricultural show\n\nAn agricultural show is a public event exhibiting the equipment, animals, sports and recreation associated with agriculture and animal husbandry. The largest comprise a livestock show (a judged event or display in which breeding stock is exhibited), a trade fair, competitions, and entertainment. The work and practices of farmers, animal fanciers, cowboys, and zoologists may be displayed. The terms \"agricultural show\" and \"livestock show\" are synonymous with the North American terms county fair and state fair.\n\nAgricultural shows are an important part of cultural life in small country towns, and a popular event in larger towns and cities. Shows range from small events in small country towns usually lasting two days, through medium-sized events of three days, to large shows, which may run for up to two weeks and combine elements of an amusement park with those of an agricultural show. Although in many countries agriculture shows are increasingly under financial pressure, many towns or areas have a show society and in some areas, several towns and villages in the area all have an annual show. Larger shows often include live entertainment and fireworks in the main arena.\n\nThe first known agricultural show was held by Salford Agricultural Society, Lancashire, in 1768.\n\nSince the 19th century, agricultural shows have provided local people with an opportunity to celebrate achievements and enjoy a break from day-to-day routine. With a combination of serious competition and light entertainment, annual shows acknowledged and rewarded the hard work and skill of primary producers and provided a venue for rural families to socialise. City shows also provide city people with an opportunity to engage directly with rural life and food production.\n\nAgriculture shows are often enlivened with competitive events, including sheaf tossing, show jumping, food competitions, and tent pegging. Demolition Derbys and rodeos are popular in the US and campdrafting and wood chopping are often held in Australia.\n\nStuds are generally available for a fee.\n\nA livestock show is an event where livestock are exhibited and judged on certain phenotypical breed traits as specified by their respective breed standard. Species of livestock that may be shown include pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, llamas, and alpacas. Poultry such as chickens, geese, ducks, turkeys, and pigeons are also shown competitively. There are also competitive shows for dogs, sheepdogs, and cats.\n\nPrize-winners at agricultural shows are generally awarded inscribed medals, cups, rosettes or ribbons. The National Museum of Australia has a rare collection of medals documenting the history of agricultural shows and rural industries across Australia. The 111 medals range in date from the mid-19th to the early 20th century and many are associated with significant individuals and organizations.\n\nRelated to a show is the \"field day\", with elements of a trade show for machinery, equipment and skills required for broadacre farming. Field days typically do not involve livestock, showbags or sideshows, but may include events such as ploughing competitions not usually associated with shows due to the larger space required. In some communities in northern England Field Days (or Club Days) have lost their agricultural character and have become community celebrations.\n\nThe events are good sources of agricultural information, as organizers can arrange for guest speakers to talk on a range of topics, such as the talk on the yellow-flowering alfalfa at the South Dakota field day. Pecan growers were given a talk on insect control by an entomologist at a recent field day at LSU AgCenter’s Pecan Research/Extension Station in Shreveport, La.\n\nA Landcare survey conducted in 1992/93 revealed that field days in Australia have a high value among local farmers. New Zealand's National Agricultural Fieldays is held annually in June at Mystery Creek, near Hamilton, New Zealand, and attracts 1,000 exhibitors and over 115,000 visitors through its gates. Smaller shows, held annually in New Zealand's towns and communities, are generally called \"agricultural and pastoral shows\" (A&P shows).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncomplete list of shows in Australia:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Thanks to volunteers, the ARCS has implemented and continues to implement its humanitarian mission.\n\nThe title of Honorary ARCS member is awarded by the Presidium to the individuals, who had provided exceptional service to the organization.\n\nThe title of Sponsoring ARCS member is awarded by the Presidium to those distinguished state and public figures, who permanently support the development and implementation of goals and objectives.\n\nIn the hard situation, following 1988 Spitak earthquake, the Armenian Red Cross Society, adopting the experience and skills of foreign National Societies and using its’ own professional and organizational capacities, managed to make a tremendous progress in a relatively short period, becoming a competent and reliable partner for those Societies and many other organizations.\n\nAfter all the necessary organizational changes, ARCS became the largest and the most competent humanitarian organization, which aims at support the vulnerable social groups, help disaster victims and distribute humanitarian ideas in the society, as well as implement other activities for the benefit of people, provided by law, regardless of nationality, racial, gender, religious and class affiliations and political views.\n\nRed Cross humanitarian mission started activities in Armenia back in 1877, when in the Erivan province Finnish Red Cross hospitals were established, as well as in 1896, when American Red Cross volunteer Clara Barton was providing assistance to Armenian population doomed to disaster under Ottoman Turkish rule. Red Cross history shows that in a chronological sense formation of National Societies very often coincides with the country's being in a military actions, and this is logical, because the Red Cross was originally designed to urgently assist sick and wounded soldiers. In this regard the formation of the Armenian Red Cross Society was not an exception.\n\n1920 ... It was a difficult period of time for the country, fight for independence. On the one hand poor agriculture and industry, on the other hand, war that resulted many refugees from Western Armenia. Hunger, squalor, disease, mottled, typhoid, cholera, malaria, dysentery were taking many lives.\n\nAnd regardless of the fact, that numerous and diverse problems facing the newly independent state, to have such a structure as the Red Cross was not so easy, however, a group of social workers with the help of doctor, scientist, public figure Spandarat Kamsarakan, established Armenian Red Cross National Society. On 19 March in 1920 Parliament of the First Republic of Armenia approved the charter and the company was named as \"Red Cross Society of Armenia \".\n\nFrom the first day of its existence, the newly established Red Cross Society of Armenia, despite limited conditions, started the difficult task of healing the sufferings. With minor conditions the company managed to open a hospital in Keshishkend (now Eghegnadzor), medical point and grocery in Norashen. Red Cross activists did a lot in the battlefront, where they had delivered invaluable aid to sick and wounded soldiers.\n\nHowever, Red Cross Society of Armenia, as well as the independent Republic of Armenia, did not have a long life. On 29 of November in 1920 The Soviet regime was established, and as number of institutions in independent Armenia, Red Cross Society of Armenia also has temporarily stopped its activities.\n\nOn 15 October in 1921, the Council of People's Commissars signed an agreement, according to which Armenia Red Cross Society activities were marked as very important, and was decided to resume the activities of the Society. And in May 1922 the charter of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) Red Cross Society was again reaffirmed and decided for the support of the activities and its regulations of the company to provide 5% of a general tax, 15% of foreign passports formulations, 2% of the income of leisure facilities and donations received from abroad.\n\nThus, with the use of government patronage and public and trade union organizations support, Armenian Soviet Red Cross Society first began to work by organizing material aid for refugees and orphans. It helped to immigrants refugees from Turkey, orphans, and by its own means opened orphanages for 100 children in Yerevan and Ejmiatsin, children's health care services, opened clinics and hospitals. Great achievements for the company were the first nursing courses, later was created a two-year nursing school.\n\nIn 1925 creates the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Association, which represents the interests of National Societies before the Soviet government, coordinates various activities of companies within its composition. Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of Soviet Union consisted of Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Armenian Red Cross Societies and Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan Red Crescent Societies.\n\nThe Great Patriotic War broke the rhythm of life. The frontline and fight back were fighting with the \"everything for front, everything for victory\" slogan. During all years of war Armenia Red Cross Society has provided an invaluable service for the protection of the country and sick and wounded soldiers. The company supported immigrant families and orphaned children. Hundreds of Red Cross volunteers were helping the wounded, taking care of orphans health and education. Thousand members of the company were taking part in the volunteer works.\n\nAfter the end of the war new problems appeared. It was necessary to strengthen the company and help healthcare bodies, engross the ranks of donors, to help the citizens to find relatives that were lost during the war. ARCS members many worthy things have done, and many of them were awarded. The company had about six hundred thousand members; it means that every fourth citizen of Republic was a member of the Red Cross Society.\n\nDecember 1988 ... The earthquake struck around the world, 25,000 dead, 19,000 wounded, destroyed homes, schools and hospitals. Earthquake destroyed 40% of Armenia's territory of about 1 million population. In the evening of December 8 the first plane of Red Cross arrived to Armenia.\n\nThe earthquake in 1988 left its unprecedented impact on ARCS restructuring and development. In the disaster zone began major humanitarian investments. A lot of international humanitarian organizations began their activities in Armenia.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (that time - League), in particular, did its most contribution concerning the disaster during its entire existence. Huge activities showed Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Union, which with its relief programs, one of the firsts rushed to the disaster zone. Number of Red Cross National Societies started participate quite active. These and other similar organizations carried out their activities through Armenian Red Cross Society (ARCS).\n\nJust 10 days after the earthquake, was made a decision to build the post-traumatic rehabilitation center in Yerevan that will serve for disabled people suffering from spinal injuries. In August 1992 the new center putted into operation-equipped with modern facilities, with the highest international standards, the only one in the former Soviet Union, which was built by the help of Red Cross 26 National Societies and 6 governments.\n\nThe center continues its work till today, where a lot of disabled have received and continue to receive treatment. Now the main activities of the center are spinal cord, spine, treatment of diseases of the locomotive apparatus, general and posttraumatic recovery, patient’s vocational training, psychosocial rehabilitation, sanatorium-spa treatment. It also takes a huge amount of work for teaching the disabled craft. These activities help the disabled integrate into society as quickly as possible and become its full members.\n\nMission\nTo reduce vulnerability of the population through mobilization of the power of humanity. To be prepared to cope with situations, which may cause vulnerability among the population. To provide essential support by assisting people made vulnerable by harsh socio-economic conditions.\n\nGoal\nThe overall goal of the Society is to prevent and alleviate human suffering, regardless of nationality, race, sex, religious beliefs, class and political opinions.\n\n"}

AMPS is an international club headquartered in the United States\n\nClubs centered around the hobby of modeling have existed since the 1950s. The Armor Modeling and Preservation Society, Inc. was founded in 1993 by armor modelers as a means of promoting the hobby using the 'open system' of contest judging.\n\nAMPS was formed as a membership club to promote the hobby of armor modeling, with bylaws that prevented any officer from deriving their income from the hobby of military vehicle modeling. The club operated without incorporation until early 2007, when it was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation in the state of New York. In 2011 AMPS gained recognition from the US federal government as a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization.\n\nAMPS has several purposes: \n\nThe AMPS bylaws and constitution provide for an Executive Board consisting of a President, First Vice-President, eight regional Second Vice Presidents, and a Secretary. Additional non-elected officers include Treasurer, Publications Editor, and Marketing Director/Public Information Officer, Web Master and Chief Judge. The founder and first President of AMPS was Steven \"Cookie\" Sewell. The current president is John Charvat.\n\nMembership is open to anyone with an interest in the hobby. Annual membership fees are $30 for members in the United States, $35 in Canada and $40 in other countries. Almost all members are located in the USA, Canada, the UK and Mexico. Currently, AMPS has just over 700 members.\n\nAMPS members often form local 'chapters' of the society. These local clubs operate as part of AMPS but their local base allow their members to meet (usually monthly) and share hobby skills, materials and references.\n\nCurrent active AMPS chapters and affiliate chapters include:\n\nMembership in AMPS gives the modelers several benefits: \n\nAMPS publishes a semi-monthly journal, \"Boresight\". Articles in \"Boresight\" are written by the members, and the publication itself is edited by volunteers. The journal typically provides several articles on real armored vehicles for reference purposes, along with modeling articles and how-to guides. AMPS accepts advertising in \"Boresight\" as a means of providing discounted hobby products to its members. Initially the publication was produced in a black and white format, the magazine is now a professionally produced publication an all color format.\n\nAMPS also has an official society Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/AMPSArmor/\n\nThe major event hosted by AMPS is the annual International Convention, held each April. This three-day show brings together hundreds of members and non-members to view models, participate in a model contest, buy hobby products, view actual military vehicles, and attend seminars. Recent international conventions have included over 500 scale models on display. The most recent international show was held April 7–9, 2016 in Sumter, South Carolina. Seminar speakers usually include tank crew veterans, well-known modelers and researchers, and industry representatives from firms such as Tamiya and AFV Club. The 2010 show was the most successful AMPS show ever with 634 models entered as well as club display tables.\n\nSmaller regional and local contests are also held from time to time, typically attracting 100+ scale models for single-day events. \n\nThe scale models entered in the contest are judged according to the AMPS Contest Rules, and may be awarded Gold, Silver or Bronze medals. Scale models are judged for accuracy, level of detail, skill in construction, and paint/markings finish. Some of these models take hundreds of hours to complete. Each modeler is provided with a feedback form showing the points given in each area and what areas need to improve. An 'open' system of judging is used in which each model competes against a standard, not against other entries. Thus, instead of 1st, 2nd and 3rd-place medals, awards are given to all models that reach specified cutoff scores. Since participants are not competing against one another, there is no disincentive to the sharing of techniques and ideas.\n\nThe feedback provided in these events is a key factor in helping modelers improve. The AMPS system provides formal feedback, giving specific information about what to improve in the model.\n\nAn 'AMPS Master' is a modeler who has either won \"Best of Show\" at the AMPS convention or who is recognized by AMPS as a Master-level modeler due to other accomplishments.\nThe current AMPS Masters (recognized as masters although never 'Best of Show' winners) are:\n\nTony Englehart\n\nMark Ford\n\nPaul Gaertner\n\nDave Kahn\n\nDave Lockhart\n\nMike McFadden\n\nMark Muller\n\nMike Roof\n\nStephen 'Cookie' Sewell\n\nDan Tisoncik\n\nSteve Zaloga\n\nMasters awarded at conventions are:\n\n1995: Ken Davis\n\n1996: Bob Collignon\n\n1997: Dave Dean\n\n1998: Bob Clifton\n\n1999: Mike Siggins and Chris Mrosko\n\n2000: Roger Lang\n\n2001: Lynn Kessler\n\n2002: Charlie Prichett\n\n2003: Jason Jennings\n\n2004: Douglas Lee\n\n2005: Alexander DeLeon\n\n2006: Don Barclay\n\n2007: Mark Hazzard\n\n2008: Steve Milstone-Turner\n\n2009: Tom Jett\n\n2010: Mark Corbett\n\n2011: Cesar (Manny) Rodriguez\n\n2012: Jim Weschler\n\n2013: John Kesner\n\n2014: Chris Durden\n\n2015: Dave Vickers\n\n2016: Tony Zadro\n\nAMPS recently launched a clearinghouse project to gather donations of plastic model kits and supplies for shipment to United States military personnel deployed to combat areas. Nearly 2000 kits and hundreds of supply items and books have been sent overseas to help morale and alleviate stress and boredom; additional shipments will follow.\n\n\n"}

However, with increased ethnic and religious persecution in their homeland, which is located in present-day southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria, Assyrian immigration to Sweden increased. Those who had lived in Sweden for a longer period of time were granted residency for humanitarian reasons given the conflicts in their place of origin.\n\nSödertälje is seen as the unofficial Assyrian/Syriac capital of Europe due to the city's high percentage of Assyrians/Syriacs. According to Assyrian organization estimates, there are approximately 150,000 Assyrians in Sweden. The Syriac Orthodox Christians number an estimated 30–40,000 people (2016), while higher estimations is 70–80,000, out of which an estimated 18,000 live in Södertälje.\n\nAccording to Statistics Sweden, as of 2016, there 22,663 are citizens of Iraq (12,705 men, 9,958 women) and 116,384 citizens of Syria (70,060 men, 46,324 women) residing in Sweden.\n\nThe first Assyrians arrived in 1967 from Lebanon, numbering some 200 people. The migration to Sweden may be broken up into a number of distinct periods. The first group consisted of those that came to work at Swedish manufacturing plants, such as Scania. There were then the subsequent waves after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, The Lebanese Civil War in 1975, the rise of Baathism in Iraq & Syria, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and more recently, from Iraq and Syria as a result of the Iraq Wars (Gulf War in 1991, Iraq War in 2003, Iraqi Civil War in 2014–present) and the Syrian Civil War in 2011–present.\n\nThere is an ideological division of this group in Sweden between\nTo account for this division, official Swedish sources refer to the group as \"Assyrier/Syrianer\", with a slash (similar to the US census, which opted for \"Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac\").\n\nThe Swedish authorities have granted many rights for Assyrian including their own professional football (soccer) teams like Assyriska FF and Syrianska FC.

{"id": "2346308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2346308", "title": "Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity", "text": "Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity\n\nUnity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith. The Bahá'í teachings state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people regardless of race or colour. Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment. Thus the Bahá'í view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation. The teaching, however, does not equal unity with uniformity, but instead the Bahá'í writings advocate for the principle of \"unity in diversity\" where the variety in the human race is valued.\n\nThe Bahá'í teaching of the \"unity of humanity\" (also known as the \"oneness of humanity\") stems from the teaching that all humans have been created equal in the image of God, and that God does not make any distinction between people. The teaching emphasizes the unity of humanity transcending all divisions of race, nation, gender, caste, and social class, while celebrating its diversity. The Bahá'í writings states that since the human race is one unified organic unit, all people have the same basic capacities, and that the physical differences, such as skin colour, are superficial and do not make one ethnic group superior to another.\n\nIn the Bahá'í view, humanity has always constituted one group, but that ignorance, prejudice and power-seeking have prevented the recognition of the oneness of humanity. The historical differences that have existed between different ethnic groups is attributable to differences in education and cultural opportunities over a long-term, as well as to racial prejudice and oppression.\n\nIn the Bahá'í view, unity does not equal uniformity, but instead the Bahá'í writings advocate for the principle of unity in diversity where the variety in the human race is valued. `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, compared the human race to a flower garden where the garden was made more beautiful by its diversities of colour and form.\n\nThe Bahá'í writings note that unity will not be arrived at through the suppression of difference, but instead when each respects the intrinsic value of other individuals and cultures. In this view, it is not the diversity that causes conflict, but rather people's intolerance and prejudice towards diversity.\n\nThe cultural norms in the religion have gone through major transitions. In the later 1930s and 1940s Bahá'ís in the West began a systematic implementation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan towards Latin America. At a certain stage of the process regional coordinating committees were appointed and a stated purpose for them was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American leading guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin leading guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. By 1961 most Latin and South American countries had their own national assembly. See Bahá'í Faith in Latin America. Almost in parallel with this process in the West in the East Bahá'ís in India were embarking on a comparable process. The Bahá'í message had for decades been primarily addressed to Indian Muslims and Parsees (Zoroastrians), a re-interpretation of the Bahá'í message in accordance with Hindu ideas was undertaken to reach the masses of Hindus. In two more years almost as many people converted as had been Bahá'ís through regions of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. By 1970 there were 3,350 assemblies and over 312,000 believers. See Bahá'í Faith in India.\n\nWhile those early processes continued locally international attention shifted to Africa for Bahá'ís in the West and East. In Africa there was widespread conversions to the religion following the 1950s. It was emphasized that pioneers be self-effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans - and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background. See Bahá'í Faith in Africa.\n\nSince then other examples of this pattern of growing respect for cultures has taken hold in specific instances. Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country, in the United States, the Bahá‘í Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed, in 1960 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised the great past of the native peoples. And in 1963 anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Bahá‘í Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin. See Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans. In Papua New Guinea whereas Christian missionaries openly opposed traditional funerary art and performances, the Bahá'ís encouraged their production as a form of worship. Thus while Nalik Bahá'ís are regarded by other Naliks as arbiters of traditional knowledge and practices, the Christian missions and their followers are seen as antagonistic to kastom. See Bahá'í Faith in Papua New Guinea.\n\nOne of the main principles of the Bahá'í Faith that comes about from the unity of humanity is the elimination of all forms of prejudice, and it entails non-discrimination against individuals on such things like race, religion, gender or class. `Abdu'l-Bahá states that while the challenge is large, social prejudices including religious, political, and patriotic lead to war, and thus the elimination of prejudice was essential for human well-being. In that regard, the Bahá'í teachings state that the elimination of all forms of prejudice is a fundamental requirement to achieve world unity and peace. Two prime examples of this in action exist - one comes from the American South, and the other from South Africa. Arriving in the face of the rise of Jim Crow laws and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan as a broad-based national movement and in contrast to Protestant, Catholic and Jewish organizations in South Carolina, the Bahá’ís explicitly promoted racial integration from the local level up. Called by the scriptures of their faith to “associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance,” they deliberately sought converts from diverse backgrounds, forging bonds of shared religious identity across traditional social boundaries even when their meetings were raided. By the end of the twentieth century, the Bahá’í Faith was the largest non-Christian religion in South Carolina, and it was well known for its longstanding commitment to promoting racial harmony, interfaith dialogue, and the moral education of children and youth. In South Africa, faced with the segregated social pattern and laws of Apartheid, the integrated population of Bahá'ís had to decide how to be composed in their administrative structures – whether the National Spiritual Assembly would be all black or all white. The Bahá'í community decided that instead of dividing the South African Bahá'í community into two population groups, one black and one white, they instead limited membership in the Bahá'í administration to black adherents, and placed the entire Bahá'í community under the leadership of its black population. In 1997 the National Spiritual Assembly presented a Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa which said in part:\n\nAbhorring all forms of prejudice and rejecting any system of segregation, the Bahá'í Faith was introduced on a one-to-one basis and the community quietly grew during the apartheid years, without publicity. Despite the nature of the politics of that time, we presented our teachings on unity and the oneness of humankind to prominent individuals in politics, commerce and academia and leaders of thought including State Presidents... [b]oth individual Bahá'ís and our administrative institutions were continually watched by the security police... Our activities did not include opposition to the previous Government for involvement in partisan politics and opposition to government are explicitly prohibited by the sacred Texts of our Faith... During the time when the previous Government prohibited integration within our communities, rather than divide into separate administrative structures for each population group, we opted to limit membership of the Bahá'í Administration to the black adherents who were and remain in the majority of our membership and thereby placed the entire Bahá'í community under the stewardship of its black membership... The pursuit of our objectives of unity and equality has not been without costs. The \"white\" Bahá'ís were often ostracized by their white neighbours for their association with \"non-whites\". The Black Bahá'ís were subjected to scorn by their black compatriots for their lack of political action and their complete integration with their white Bahá'í brethren. The most tragic loss to our community was the brutal execution of four of our adherents, at our places of worship, three in Mdantsane and one in Umtata.\n\nAn essential mission in Bahá'u'lláh's, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, teachings was to bring about a consciousness in the peoples of the world regarding the oneness of humankind. However, Bahá'u'lláh stated that along with the increase in individual and collective consciousness of the oneness of humanity, new social structures are also needed for the oneness of humanity to be achieved. He wrote:\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings thus state that it is not sufficient that humanity acknowledge its oneness and still live in a disunited world that contains prejudice and conflict. In Bahá'í belief, humanity has gone through a process of progressive revelation through various different messengers of God, including Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad and others, where humanity has grown collectively. In this belief, society has been steadily organizing itself with higher levels of unity through the various messengers of God; going from the unity of the family, the tribe, the city-state and the nation. The Bahá'í writings state that the next stage of the collective growth is that of world unity and the organization of society as a planetary civilization. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, wrote:\n\nThus in the Bahá'í view, unity must be expressed by building a universal and unified social system that is based on spiritual principles. In this view, the fundamental purpose of society is spiritual and is to create a society that is favourable to the healthy development of all its peoples.\n\n\n\n\n"}

These games typically take place in the morning of the wedding at the bride's family home, before the groom is allowed to receive the bride in the bride's room. The groom typically receives the help of his groomsmen in completing the tasks. \n\nCommon games include the consumption of unpleasant foods, answering of questions pertaining to the bride and the bride and groom's relationship, and performance of song and dance. Negotiations are commonly made regarding the bridesmaids' demands, accompanied almost always by bargaining concerning the red envelope offerings to the bridesmaids. These games originated in ancient Chinese folk customs, and have been elaborated on in modern times. \n\nThese games are distinct from the practice of \"\" () in China, sometimes confusingly also known as wedding games, in which the couple, particularly the bride, is teased by their guests during or after the wedding.\n\nDoor games are known in Chinese in mainland China as \"games with which to receive the groom\" ' or \"games with which to block the door\" ' . In Hong Kong, the process is known in Cantonese as \"playing with the groom\" ().\n\nIn Malaysia, these games are called \"heng dai\" games, after the Cantonese word referring to the groomsmen (), while in Singapore, the process is known as the wedding gatecrash.\n\nBefore the games start, the groom and groomsmen must first pay a fee in order for the bridesmaids to open the door. It is common for the groom and groomsmen to prepare red envelopes filled with cash that they use to negotiate with the bridesmaids who guard the door. These amounts are usually in multiples of auspicious numbers, such as the number 8 that signifies wealth, or 9, that signifies a long-lasting union. Groomsmen often will carry ample amounts of red envelopes and try to negotiate with the bridesmaids as to the amount of red envelopes that is required before they agree to open to the door. \n\nDoor games usually include the consumption of unpleasant or strange food or drink. In particular, grooms are made to consume foods that are sour, sweet, bitter and spicy () in succession, to signify his resolve to weather the joys and sorrows of marriage with his partner. Bitter foods used for this purpose include bitter tea and bitter gourd, while spicy foods include wasabi and chilli padi. In addition, declarations of love through words, songs and poems from the groom may also be requested. It is not uncommon for door games to also include physical tests, such as push-ups, and cross-dressing, especially in Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nWedding door games are an opportunity for grooms to demonstrate their resolve and commitment, which some brides appreciate. The practice is also seen by some as a valued tradition and a rite of passage. Wedding games may also add to the fun and excitement of the wedding.\n\nHowever, the prospect of these challenges may induce anxiety in grooms before the wedding. In addition, many couples are becoming disillusioned about the meaning provided by such games, noting that the games are humiliating and labour-intensive to prepare. Some couples set boundaries on the games, such as excluding sexual elements. One wedding photographer estimated in 2016 that roughly 20% of Singaporean Chinese couples do away with such wedding door games, even while retaining the other elements of a traditional Chinese wedding.\n"}

Azerbaijan ratified a United Nations convention in 1995, and a Gender Information Center opened in 2002. A committee on women's issues was established in 1998. \n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares that women and men should have equal human rights. However, women are still in need of additional protection to help them attain gender equality. In simple terms, gender equality means reinforcing the protection and promotion of women’s human rights.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Azerbaijan, men and women are equal before the law. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender, including workplace discrimination.\n\nThe 21-article Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan On State Guarantees of Equal Rights for Women and Men, adopted on 10 October 2006, aims to eliminate all forms of gender-based discrimination and ensure gender equality in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres. All human rights are guaranteed to women and men. To implement the law, public authorities must regularly review legislation related to gender equality and amend it as necessary. The dissemination of information about gender equality and education in the field has been defined by the law as essential.\n\nA law to prevent domestic violence was adopted on 22 June 2010. The law focuses on domestic violence between close relatives to mitigate its negative legal, medical and social outcomes and provide legal and social assistance for victims. Although it does not state that its aim is to protect women, women are the victims in most cases of domestic violence. The law accepts the prohibition of discrimination against women as a core principle, enumerating three types of domestic violence: physical, psychological and sexual.\n\nAzerbaijan ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1995, and signed its optional protocol in 2000. The first government report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was published on 16 September 1996. The convention clarifies the meaning of \"discrimination against women\" and assigns the state organizations responsible for taking appropriate measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. \n\nCooperation between UNIFEM and Azerbaijan has taken the form of the Women for Conflict Prevention and Peace Building in the Southern Caucasus regional project. The first phase of the project, aiming to promote the activities of women’s organizations and support activists, leaders, and youth in gender equality, peace-building and conflict prevention, took place between 2001 and 2004. The project's second phase, from 2004 to 2007, built on the first phase and reinforced women’s rights based on CEDAW, UN Security Council Resolution 1325, Millennium Development Goals and the Beijing Platform for Action.\n\nThe Open Society Fund introduced the Azerbaijan Gender Information Center (AGIC) in 2002. The AGIC is made up of several women organizations: the Research Center of Modern Social Processes; the Association of Creative Women and the Azerbaijan Association of Organizational and Technical Development, both in Baku; the Shams Women and Youth Center in Mingechaur, and the Hudat Center of Youth Programme Development.\n\nThe Research Center for Modern Social Processes is responsibility for the center. APEAT has conducted studies in collaboration with other organizations, including women’s business cooperation in the southern Caucasus (for the Eurasia Foundation in 1999); women in social conflict (for the World Bank in 2000); women in Azerbaijan society (for Altair in 2000); women against violence (for ISAR-Gorizonte in 2001); women in the local community (for ISAR-Gorizonte in 2002), and gender resources and development of the third sector in Azerbaijan (for ISAR in 2002). \n\nThe Organizational and Technical development Association (an AGIC member) has implemented the following projects in cooperation with the Eurasia Foundation (which supported the association's creation): incubating nongovernmental women's organizations (2000) and women's businesses (2002), and marketing the third sector in Azerbaijan (2001).\n\nThe State Committee on Women's Affairs]] was established by presidential decree on 14 January 1998, and was replaced with the State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs by another decree on 6 February 2006. The committee charter was approved by presidential decree on 9 August of that year. \n\nThe committee, a ministerial-level body in Baku (the Azerbaijani capital), is financed by the government budget and is responsible for implementing state policy on family, women and children’s affairs. It may propose legislation and sign agreements with the relevant bodies of foreign countries and international organizations, in accordance with the Constitution of Azerbaijan, international agreements to which Azerbaijan is a party, and relevant laws.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10892972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10892972", "title": "Integer factorization records", "text": "Integer factorization records\n\nInteger factorization is the process of determining which prime numbers divide a given positive integer. Doing this quickly has applications in cryptography. The difficulty depends on both the size and form of the number and its prime factors; it is currently very difficult to factorize large semiprimes (and, indeed, most numbers which have no small factors).\n\nThe first very large distributed factorisation was RSA129, a challenge number described in the Scientific American article of 1977 which first popularised the RSA cryptosystem. It was factorised between September 1993 and April 1994, using MPQS, with relations contributed by about 600 people from all over the Internet, and the final stages of the calculation performed on a MasPar supercomputer at Bell Labs.\n\nBetween January and August 1999, RSA-155, a challenge number prepared by the RSA company, was factorised using GNFS with relations again contributed by a large group, and the final stages of the calculation performed in just over nine days on the Cray C916 supercomputer at the SARA Amsterdam Academic Computer Center.\n\nIn January 2002, Franke et al. announced the factorisation of a 158-digit cofactor of 2+1, using a couple of months on about 25 PCs at the University of Bonn, with the final stages done using a cluster of six Pentium-III PCs.\n\nIn April 2003, the same team factored RSA-160 using about a hundred CPUs at BSI, with the final stages of the calculation done using 25 processors of an SGI Origin supercomputer.\n\nThe 174-digit RSA-576 was factored by Franke, Kleinjung and members of the NFSNET collaboration in December 2003, using resources at BSI and the University of Bonn; soon afterwards, Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama, Sonoda and Ueda announced that they had factored a 164-digit cofactor of 2+1.\n\nA 176-digit cofactor of 11+1 was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between February and May 2005 using machines at NTT and Rikkyo University in Japan.\n\nThe RSA-200 challenge number was factored by Franke, Kleinjung et al. between December 2003 and May 2005, using a cluster of 80 Opteron processors at BSI in Germany; the announcement was made on 9 May 2005. They later (November 2005) factored the slightly smaller RSA-640 challenge number.\n\nOn December 12, 2009, a team including researchers from the CWI, the EPFL, INRIA and NTT in addition to the authors of the previous record factored RSA-768, a 232-digit semiprime. They used the equivalent of almost 2000\nyears of computing on a single core 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron.\n\n12 − 1, of 542 bits (163 digits), was factored between April and July 1993 by a team at CWI and Oregon State University.\n\n2 + 1, of 774 bits (233 digits), was factored between April and November 2000 by 'The Cabal', with the matrix step done over 250 hours on the Cray also used for RSA-155.\n\n2 − 1, of 809 bits (244 digits), had its factorisation announced at the start of January 2003. Sieving was done at the CWI, at the Scientific Computing Institute and the Pure Mathematics Department at Bonn University, and using private resources of J. Franke, T. Kleinjung and the family of F. Bahr. The linear algebra step was done by P. Montgomery at SARA in Amsterdam.\n\n6 − 1, of 911 bits (275 digits), was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between September 2005 and January 2006 using SNFS.\n\n2 − 1, of 1039 bits (313 digits) (though a factor of 23 bits was already known) was factored between September 2006 and May 2007 by a group including K. Aoki, J. Franke, T. Kleinjung, A. K. Lenstra and D. A. Osvik, using computers at NTT, EPFL and the University of Bonn.\n\n2 − 1, of 1061 bits (320 digits) was factored between early 2011 and 4 August 2012 by a group headed by Greg Childers at CSU Fullerton, using the nfs@home BOINC project for about 300 CPU-years of sieving; the linear algebra was run at the Trestles cluster at SDSC and the Lonestar cluster at TACC and needed additional 35 CPU-years.\n\nAll unfactored parts of the numbers 2 − 1 with n between 1000 and 1200 were factored by a multiple-number-sieve approach in which much of the sieving step could be done simultaneously for multiple numbers, by a group including T. Kleinjung, J. Bos and A. K. Lenstra, starting in 2010. To be precise, n=1081 was completed on 11 March 2013; n=1111 on 13 June 2013; n=1129 on 20 September 2013; n=1153 on 28 October 2013; n=1159 on 9 February 2014; 1177 on May 29, 2014, n=1193 on 22 August 2014, and n=1199 on December 11, 2014; the first detailed announcement was made in late August 2014. The total effort for the project is of the order of 7500 CPU-years on 2.2 GHz Opterons, with roughly 5700 years spent sieving and 1800 years on linear algebra.\n\nAs of the end of 2007, thanks to the constant decline in memory prices, the ready availability of multi-core 64-bit computers, and the availability of the efficient sieving code (developed by Thorsten Kleinjung of the Bonn group) via ggnfs and of robust open-source software such as msieve for the finishing stages, special-form numbers of up to 750 bits and general-form numbers of up to about 520 bits can be factored in a few months on a few PCs by a single person without any special mathematical experience. These bounds increase to about 950 and 600 if it were possible to secure the collaboration of a few dozen PCs for sieving; currently the amount of memory and the CPU power of a single machine for the finishing stage are equal barriers to progress.\n\nIn 2009, Benjamin Moody factored a 512-bit RSA key used to sign the TI-83 graphing calculator using software found on the internet; this eventually led to the Texas Instruments signing key controversy.\n\nIn September 2013, the 696-bit RSA-210 was factored by Ryan Propper using institutional resources; between March 2013 and October 2014, another 210-digit number (the 117th term in the 'home prime sequence' starting with 49) was completed by a user known as WraithX, using $7600 worth of processing time on Amazon EC2 machines for the sieving, and four months on a dual Xeon E5-2687W v1 for the linear algebra.\n\nThe largest number factored by Shor's algorithm is 21 in 2012. 15 had previously been factored by several labs.\n\nIn April 2012, the factorization of formula_1 by a room temperature (300K) NMR adiabatic quantum computer was reported by a group led by Xinhua Peng. In November 2014 it was discovered by Nike Dattani and Nathan Bryans that the 2012 experiment had in fact also factored much larger numbers without knowing it. In April 2016 the 18-bit number 200099 was factored using quantum annealing on a D-Wave 2X quantum processor. Shortly after, 291311 was factored using NMR at higher than room temperature.\n\n"}

Rawles is a former U.S. Army Intelligence officer. He is the founder and Senior Editor of SurvivalBlog.com, which covers survival and preparedness topics, and has published collected material from this in two books. He also works as a survival retreat consultant. Rawles is a Constitutionalist Christian libertarian. On his book covers, in his signature, on his checks, in his blog, and as his legal name, he presents his name as \"James Wesley, Rawles\", using a comma to distinguish between his given and family names.\n\nJames Wesley, Rawles was born James Wesley Rawles in California in 1960 and attended local public schools. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism from San Jose State University.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1993, he served as a United States Army Military Intelligence officer. He resigned his commission as a U.S. Army Captain immediately after Bill Clinton was inaugurated as President of the United States.\n\nRawles worked as an Associate Editor and Regional Editor (Western U.S.) with \"Defense Electronics\" magazine in the late 1980s and early 1990s Concurrently he was Managing Editor of \"The International Countermeasures Handbook.\"\n\nHe worked as a technical writer through most of the 1990s with a variety of electronics and software companies, including Oracle Corporation. In 2005, he began blogging full-time. He has since given up day-to-day blogging in order to devote more time to writing books.\n\nRawles is now a freelance writer, blogger, and survival retreat consultant. He was described as the \"conscience of survivalism.\" He is best known as the author of the survivalist novel \"\".\n\nRawles published a defense of his anti-racist views in a blog entry entitled \"Race, Religion, and Reason\" in 2010.\n\nRawles believes that survivalists see a high risk of a coming societal meltdown and the need to prepare for the repercussions. He has said that the popular media has developed an incorrect far-right \"lunatic fringe\" image in part because of the actions of a radical few. He called this a distortion of the true message of survivalism. Unlike the handful of fringe proponents, Rawles focuses instead on family preparedness and personal freedom. He explains that the typical survivalist does not actually live in a rural area, but is rather a city dweller worried about the collapse of society who views the rural lifestyle as idyllic. He cautions that rural self-sufficiency actually involves \"a lot of hard work\". In 2009, he said: \"There's so many people who are concerned about the economy that there's a huge interest in preparedness, and it pretty much crosses all lines, social, economic, political and religious. There's a steep learning curve going on right now.\" In a December 2014 interview with \"The Economist\" magazine, Rawles described the survivalist movement as decentralized and full of people who value their privacy. He said: \"You don't want to be known as the guy who has 3-4 years' supply of food in the basement. Because one day you could see it confiscated by the government or stolen by neighbours like hungry locusts.\"\n\nRawles is the Senior Editor of SurvivalBlog.com, a blog on survival and preparedness topics. It has been described as \"the guiding light of the prepper movement\" and \"the grandaddy of survival blogs\". He concentrates on encouraging family preparedness for many possible threats toward society. He has turned over day-to-day editing of the blog to others. In his various writings, Rawles has warned about socio-economic collapse, pandemics, X-class solar flares taking down power grids, terrorist attacks, and food shortages.\n\nRawles has seven books in print that are sold by mainstream booksellers: five novels and two nonfiction survival books. His second nonfiction book, titled \"Tools for Survival\", was published in late 2014.\n\nHis novels tend to be heavy on acronyms and technical jargon, while his non-fiction books concentrate on practical skills and tools. In the Acknowledgments note to his book \"Tools For Survival\", Rawles credits David Brin, Algis Budrys, Tom Clancy, Bruce D. Clayton, Colonel Jeff Cooper, Frederick Forsyth, Pat Frank, Gordon Dickson, Friedrich Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, Ernest Hemingway, Dean Ing, Elmer Keith, Herbert W. McBride, Ludwig von Mises, Dr. Gary North, Arthur W. Pink, John Piper, Jerry Pournelle, Ayn Rand, Lew Rockwell, Murray Rothbard, George R. Stewart and Mel Tappan as influential to his writing. In his blog, Rawles also cites Robert A. Heinlein as an influence, and often quotes him.\n\nHis first novel was a work of speculative fiction set in a near future including hyperinflation and socioeconomic collapse. Initially titled: \"Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse\", and later re-titled: \"\". The book was originally released in draft form as shareware under the title \"Triple Ought\" in the early 1990s. It was released in a printed edition by Huntington House. After Huntington House went out of business, the book was re-released by Xlibris, a \"print on demand\" publisher. Starting in April 2009, the novel was published in a paperback edition by Ulysses Press. It was updated to include a glossary and index.\n\nIn early April 2009, shortly after its release, it was ranked number 6 in Amazon.com's overall book sales rankings, but fell to number 33 a week later. By the end of the month it had fallen to number 98. The book's initial popularity caught librarians unprepared because it was considered a niche title and had not been reviewed by the major book review publications. According to \"Library Journal\", the topic struck a chord with \"a small but vociferous group of people concerned with survivalism\" who share a sense of societal anxiety associated with the economic recession. The journal went on to say that \"Patriots\" was \"reportedly originally conceived as a nonfiction guide. According to a number of Amazon.com reviewers, the novel will not win any literary prizes; its strength lies in its practical reassurances, focus on guns, and Christian ideology.\" Librarians then scrambled to purchase copies of the book to meet the unanticipated demand.\n\n\"Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse\" is a contemporaneous sequel novel that parallels the events that occur in \"Patriots\", following a hyperinflationary socioeconomic collapse and the subsequent events known as \"The Crunch\". The novel follows several new characters (and some characters from \"Patriots\") as they attempt to survive in the United States following The Crunch as they deal with criminal gangs, a provisional American government, and the general breakdown of society. The book was released on 4 October 2011. It rose to #2 in Amazon's overall book sales ranks, the same day. On 23 October 2011, it was listed at #3 in the \"New York Times\" Best Sellers list in the fiction hardback category. Less than a month after publication, the novel had gone through four printings and had 52,500 copies in print. A Spanish edition (titled \"Superviventes\"), was released in 2014.\n\n\"Founders: A Novel of the Coming Collapse\" is a contemporaneous sequel that parallels the events that occur in \"Patriots\" and \"Survivors\". It was released on 25 September 2012. The book peaked at #4 in Amazon's overall book sales ranks, on its release day. The book premiered on the \"New York Times\" Best Sellers list at #11, but dropped to #27 a week later.\n\n\"Expatriates: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse\" is a contemporaneous sequel novel that parallels the events that occur in \"Patriots\", \"Survivors\", and \"Founders\" including perspectives from Melanesia and Australasia as well as the USA. This 301-page novel was released on 1 October 2013. The book debuted at #21 in hardback fiction category on the \"New York Times\" Bestsellers List.\n\n\"Liberators: A Novel of the Coming Global Collapse\" is a contemporaneous sequel novel that parallels the events that occur in \"Patriots\", \"Survivors\", \"Founders\", and \"Expatriates\". It is the final novel in the series. This 416-page novel (the longest in the series) was released in October 2014.\n\nHis \"How to Survive the End of the World as We Know It: Tactics, Techniques, and Technologies for Uncertain Times\" is a non-fiction book drawn primarily from his posts on SurvivalBlog.com. The book was described as \"The preppers' Bible\", by a Reuters journalist. His blog addresses preparing for the multitude of possible threats toward society. Rawles describes how to prepare against a post-disaster society that suffers looting, armed violence and food shortages. He recommends establishing rural safe havens at least 300 miles from the nearest major city, financial planning for a future barter-based economy, water retrieval and purification, food production and storage, security and self-defense techniques and strategies.\n\nThe book received a mixed review from the \"New York Journal of Books:\"\n\nFor a neutral assessment of the huge efforts put in by the author, the book has its own strengths and weaknesses; however, the former outweigh the latter by a huge margin. One of its crystal clear strengths is the author's obsession with precision and a clinical eye for relevant details.\n\nIt received a favorable book review on the weblog of Orville R. Weyrich Jr. A summary of the book was published in the March–April 2010 issue of \"The Futurist\" magazine, under the headline: \"Alarmingly Practical Advice For Doomsday.\"\n\nSyndicated radio talk show host G. Gordon Liddy interviewed Rawles and said that his book \"posits a collapse of civilization.\" When Rawles was interviewed by radio host Laura Ingraham, she described the book as going \"through point-by-point the basics of being prepared and heightening your chances of surviving some type of major crisis.\" Ingraham said that \"there is a thin line between order and total anarchy in time of a crisis, when peoples' lives are on the line—and all the niceties and the rules go out the door.\"\n\n\"How to Survive the End of the World as We Know It\" has 14 chapters and three appendices, 336 pages, . September 2009. First Printing (September 2009): 20,000 copies. Second Printing (October 2009): 6,000 copies. Third Printing (October 2009): 25,000 copies. An unabridged audiobook edition is also available (), produced by Brilliance Audiobooks. It was narrated by Dick Hill. As of March 2011, there were 132,000 copies of the book in print, and it had gone through 11 printings. As of April 2012, there were 12 foreign publishing contracts in place to produce editions in 11 languages, and the book was still in Amazon.com's Top 250 titles, overall. The German edition, \"Überleben in der Krise\" was translated by Angelika Unterreiner and published in 2011 by Kopp Verlag. The French edition, \"Fin du Monde: Comment survivre?\" was translated by Antony Angrand. It was released in September 2012. The Spanish edition: \"Cómo Sobrevivir al Fin del Mundo tal Como lo Conocemos\" was translated by Juan Carlos Ruiz Franco in Spain and Javier Medrano in the United States. It was released in April 2012. A Romanian translation (\"Ghid De Supravietuir\") from Editura Paralela 45 in Bucharest was released in November 2013. It was translated by Ioan Es. Pop, a well-known Romanian poet, political figure, translator, and academic.\n\nHis \"Tools For Survival: What You Need to Survive When You're on Your Own\" (2014) is another non-fiction book drawn primarily from his SurvivalBlog.com posts. The publisher describes the book as \"a guide to the selection, use, and care of tools.\" It was released on December 30, 2014, by Penguin Books, and immediately jumped to #1 in Amazon's Survival & Emergency Preparedness books category. The paperback book's ISBN is 978-0-452-29812-5. It is also sold as an e-book and audiobook.\n\nOn December 1, 2015, Rawles released the novel \"Land of Promise\", the first book in the \"Counter-Caliphate Chronicles\" novel series. This science fiction novel is a geopolitical thriller that is a considerable departure from his previous \"Patriots\" thriller novel series. Set in the late 2130s, \"Land of Promise\" fictionally describes the world under the economic and military domination of a Global Islamic Caliphate, brought about by a fictional new branch of Islam, called The Thirdists. The novel also describes the establishment of a Christian nation of refuge called The Ilemi Republic, in East Africa. This is the first book in a planned six-novel series. It is the first release from Liberty Paradigm Publishing, a publishing venture launched by Rawles in partnership with his literary agent Robert Gottlieb of Trident Media Group.\n\nRawles is an proponent of family preparedness, especially regarding food storage and advocates relocating to lightly populated rural \"retreat\" areas. His preparedness philosophy emphasizes the fragility of modern society, the value of silver and other tangibles for barter, recognition of moral absolutes, being well-armed, maintaining a \"deep larder,\" relocation to rural retreats, and Christian charity. In an interview in \"The New York Times\", Rawles identified himself as a \"guns and groceries\" survivalist.\n\nRawles interprets the 2nd Amendment as supporting citizens' individual rights to bear and keep arms. He believes they should be able to take arms to public events.\n\nRawles is opposed to racism. He supports abolition of modern slavery in the world.\n\nIn March 2011, Rawles formulated the American Redoubt movement. Rawles proposes five western states (Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, eastern Oregon, and eastern Washington) as a safe haven for conservative Christians and Jews. The concept was endorsed by former Presidential candidate Chuck Baldwin, who had recently relocated his entire extended family to western Montana. One of its adherents, John Jacob Schmidt, started a weekly podcast called \"Radio Free Redoubt\" to help further the movement.\n\nRawles is a proponent of Citizen Journalism. In April 2014, along with his son Robert, Rawles co-founded The Constitution First Amendment Press Association (CFAPA), a private free press advocacy group that distributes press credentials to any literate adult U.S. Citizen, free of charge.\n\nRawles has lived in San Jose, California; near Orofino, Idaho; near Smartsville in Fremont, California; and near New Washoe City, Nevada. An article published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 2008 incorrectly asserted that Rawles lived in California, but later in that article, Rawles noted that the location of his ranch in the United States is kept secret, but that he lives somewhere west of the Rockies. The German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" asserts that the ranch is in northern Idaho. Others have claimed that the \"undisclosed location\" of the ranch is in Nevada, Utah, Wyoming or even in Central America. A CNN Europe article written before his first wife died noted that Rawles \"... lives on a ranch in an undisclosed location with his wife (who he refers to in his blog affectionately as 'the Memsahib') and their children. Their life is almost entirely self-sufficient: They keep livestock, hunt elk and the children are schooled at home. Stored away in the ranch somewhere is a three-year supply of food.\" In an article titled \"The Most Dangerous Novel in America\", Rawles told \"The Daily Beast\": \"I'm not at liberty to discuss where I live. It's part of an agreement I made with my wife. I really can't go into the details. We live in a very remote area. I embrace technology. We don't live in a cellphone area, but I'm online constantly. We're just prepared to live off-grid, if the power grid goes down. Because of the nature of my blog and my novel, I don't just want anonymity, I \"need\" anonymity. I could wake up some morning in the aftermath of some crisis and look out in my barnyard and see five Winnebagos and some television news crews. I don't want fans of my books to descend on my property, so I have to be perspicacious.\" In 2009, Rawles told an Agence France-Presse reporter: \"I'm surrounded by national forest. A river runs through the back end of the property, so there's no shortage of water and no shortage of fish or game to shoot. If Western civilization were to collapse tomorrow, I'd have to read about it on the Internet. I just wouldn't notice.\" His U.S. mail address is a post office box in Newcastle, Wyoming, but his main web site server is in Sweden.\n\n\n"}

In a broad sense, it means border countries—any group of neighbors of a given nation which border each other thus forming a rim around that country. The English term derives from \"pays limitrophes\", a term in diplomatic French. \n\nIn ancient Rome, the term referred to provinces at the borders of the Roman Empire (), which were obliged to provide billeting of the \"limitanei\" legions deployed on their territory, mostly in \"limes\".\n\nIn modern history, it was used to reference provinces which seceded from the Russian empire at the end of World War I, during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922), thus forming a kind of belt separating the Soviet Russia from the Western powers.\n\nBefore the Treaty of Versailles was signed on and even after it was not clear yet, which territories of the Russian Empire, either occupied by German troops or engaged in the Civil War in Russia, may maintain their independence, which they started to proclaim from late 1917. Thus the very composition of the Limitrophe zone was uncertain and varied widely. Arguing that these nations were then \"the cards to change hands in big political games\", among them the Baltic peoples, Poles, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and so on.\n\nThe usage of term \"limitrophe states\" continued after World War I.

The \"Small Soviet Encyclopedia\" (1929) defines the limitrophe states as \"states formed from the outskirts of the former Tsarist Russia, mainly from the western provinces\". It includes in their list Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, adding \"and, partially, Poland and Finland\". Nine years later the Ushakov's Explanatory Dictionary (1938) also syntactically 'separates' Finland from the three Baltic States: (\"Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Finland as well\").

Prior to its prohibition, U.S. politicians known for growing hemp include some of the nation's Founding Fathers and presidents. Politicians who have admitted to recreational use of the drug during prohibition include mayors, governors, members of the House of Representatives, Senators and presidents.\n\n\nIn the U.S., cannabis was initially grown for industrial reasons, though it quickly became a staple medicinal product in the early 19th century and recreational use became more prevalent during the 20th century. Harry J. Anslinger, Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, responded to political pressure to ban marijuana at a nationwide level. The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 created an expensive excise tax, and included penalty provisions and elaborate rules of enforcement to which marijuana, cannabis, or hemp handlers, were subject. Mandatory sentencing and increased punishment were enacted when the United States Congress passed the Boggs Act of 1952 and the Narcotics Control Act of 1956.\n\nDuring the counterculture of the 1960s, attitudes towards marijuana and drug abuse policy changed as marijuana use among \"white middle-class college students\" became widespread. In \"Leary v. United States\" (1969), the Supreme Court held the Marihuana Tax Act to be unconstitutional since it violated the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, privilege against self-incrimination. In response, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which repealed the Marihuana Tax Act. In 1972, the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse concluded that marijuana should be decriminalized, but that public use and driving while intoxicated should remain illegal. By the end of the decade, several states had decriminalized the drug, while many others weakened their laws against cannabis use.\n\nHowever, a wave of conservatism during the 1980s allowed president Ronald Reagan to accelerate the War on Drugs during his presidency, prompting anti-drug campaigns such as the \"Just Say No\" campaign of First Lady Nancy Reagan. Federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana were increased by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act (1984), the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986), and the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendment Act (1988). Since California voters passed the Proposition 215 in 1996, which legalized medical cannabis, several states have followed suit. However, \"United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative\" (2001) rejected the common-law medical necessity defense to crimes enacted under the Controlled Substances Act because Congress concluded that cannabis has \"no currently accepted medical use\" and \"Gonzales v. Raich\" (2005) concluded that the Commerce Clause of the Article I of the Constitution allowed the federal government to ban the use of cannabis, including medical use. Today, cannabis remains classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and possession is punishable by up to one year in jail and a minimum fine of $1,000 for a first conviction.\n\nPoliticians that have reported using cannabis during prohibition include mayors, governors, members of the House of Representatives, Senators and presidents.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tongs and outlaw motorcycle gangs, as well as terrorist, militant, and paramilitary groups are mentioned if they are involved in criminal activity for funding. However, since their stated aim and genesis is often ideological rather than commercial, they are distinct from mafia-type groups.\n\nIn several drug-producing or transit countries, drug traffickers have taken advantage of local corruption and lack of law enforcement to establish cartels turning in millions if not billions of dollars each year. Sometimes if government enforcement is particularly poor, the cartels become quasi-paramilitary organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItalian immigrants to the United States in the early 20th century formed various small-time gangs which gradually evolved into sophisticated crime syndicates which dominated organized crime in America for several decades. Although government crackdowns and a less-tightly knit Italian-American community have largely reduced their power, they remain an active force in the underworld\n\n\n\n\n\"Certain members of the Black Panther Party, particularly the Oakland chapter, also engaged in criminal activities such as drug dealing and extortion.\"\n\n\n\nOrganized crime in Italy, especially the south, has existed for hundreds of years and has given rise to a number of notorious organizations with their own traditions and subculture which have managed to infiltrate almost every part of Italian society. The Italian mafia is often thought of as being the archetype for organized crime worldwide.\n\n\n\n\nBalkan organized crime gained prominence in the chaos following the communist era, notably the transition to capitalism and the wars in former Yugoslavia.\n\n\nAlthough organized crime existed in the Soviet era, the gangs really gained in power and international reach during the transition to capitalism. The term Russian Mafia, 'mafiya' or mob is a blanket (and somewhat inaccurate) term for the various organized crime groups that emerged in this period from the 15 former republics of the USSR and unlike their Italian counterparts does not mean members are necessarily of Russian ethnicity or uphold any ancient criminal traditions, although this is the case for some members.\n\n\n\"See also Caucasus Emirate\"\n\n\n\n\n\"See also Kenji Doihara's criminal activities and Aum Shinrikyo\"\n\nThe yakuza of Japan are similar to the Italian mafias in that they originated centuries ago and follow a rigid set of traditions, but have several aspects that make them unique, such as their full-body tattoos and their fairly open place in Japanese society. Many yakuza groups are umbrella organizations, smaller gangs reporting to a larger crime syndicate.\n\n\n\nThe Triads is a popular name for a number of Chinese criminal secret societies, which have existed in various forms over the centuries (see for example Tiandihui). However, not all Chinese gangs fall into line with these traditional groups, as many non-traditional criminal organizations have formed, both in China and the Chinese diaspora.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs society enters the Information Age, certain individuals take advantage of easy flow of information over the Internet to commit online fraud or similar activities. Often the hackers will form a network to better facilitate their activities. On occasion the hackers will be a part of a criminal gang involved in more 'blue collar crime', but this is unusual.\n\n\nSmuggling is a behavior that has occurred ever since there were laws or a moral code that forbade access to a specific person or object. At the core of any smuggling organization is the economic relationship between supply and demand. From the organization's point of view, the issues are what the consumer wants, and how much the consumer is willing to pay the smuggler or smuggling organization to obtain it.\n\n\n\nPrisons are a natural meeting place for criminals, and for the purposes of protection from other inmates and business prisoners join gangs. These gangs often develop a large influence outside the prison walls through their networks. Most prison gangs do more than offer simple protection for their members. Most often, prison gangs are responsible for any drug, tobacco or alcohol handling inside correctional facilities. Furthermore, many prison gangs involve themselves in prostitution, assaults, kidnappings and murders. Prison gangs often seek to intimidate the other inmates, pressuring them to relinquish their food and other resources. In addition, prison gangs often exercise a large degree of influence over organized crime in the \"free world\", larger than their isolation in prison might lead one to expect.\n\n\n\nYouth gangs have often served as a recruiting ground for more organized crime syndicates, where juvenile delinquents grow up to be full-fledged mobsters, as well as providing muscle and other low-key work. Increasingly, especially in the United States and other western countries, street gangs are becoming much more organized in their own right with a hierarchical structure and are fulfilling the role previously taken by traditional organized crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5966367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5966367", "title": "Mutual credit", "text": "Mutual credit\n\n\"Mutual credit\" (sometimes called \"multilateral barter\" or \"credit clearing\") is a term mostly used in the field of complementary currencies to describe a common, usually small scale, endogenous money system. \n\nThe term implies that creditors and debtors are the same people lending to each other, but there are several nuances. Some think of mutual credit as a type of currency but this can be problematic because no currency or money is 'issued' in the sense that most people would understand it. Cash is very rarely 'issued', accounting normally taking place on a ledger, therefore it could also be called 'ledger money', a money \"system\", accounting for exchange or credit clearing system. The accounting is explained under multilateral exchange.\n\nThe practice of multilateral exchange can be a mere convenience, but once a common unit of account is agreed, the extent to which members can draw credit limited, a mutual credit system quickly resembles a money system. However, mutual credit is not one of the recognised schools of economic thought, perhaps because its egalitarian implication makes it politically unacceptable. \n\nEven so, Keynes proposed a mutual credit system called International Clearing Union instead of a gold standard, but it was rejected, likely because equal relations and payable debts would have reduced American leverage over the global economy.\n\nThe ideas can, however, be found in mutualism, which does value equitable exchange and cooperation.\n\nIn the mainstream economy, money is regarded as a scarce commodity, which is rented out many times simultaneously by those who have it, to those who don't. This practice leads directly to hoarding and thus scarcity of money, to a growing wealth gap, to the poverty trap, the boom/bust cycle the economic growth 'imperative' and many other seemingly eternal social evils.\n\nMutual credit accounting emphasises the importance of balanced exchange over the importance of property owners getting something for nothing. \nWhen every credit is matched by an equal and opposite debt, which is to say when there is no money and no interest, then supply equals demand \"a priori\", and all the problems of economic equilibrium go away. \n\nSimilarly, the very politicised question of the size of the money supply is solved because the credit is perfectly elastic; it is available in whatever quantity the debtor is trusted to repay. Without interest on deposits, there is no reason to hoard credit – all credit is treated as a short-term loan between trusted partners, though many systems make provision for default similar to insurance.\n\nThe implication of mutual credit is that anyone can access credit to the extent to which they are trusted to repay. This can be contrasted to commercial credit systems in which only banks can 'issue' credit. Similarly the risk of default is spread differently.\n\nIn a fiat money system the benefits of issuing money fall to the sovereign who can spend money out of nothing. In a commercial credit system the interest from lending money out of nothing falls to the bank. In a mutual credit system, there is no seignorage mechanism, and no interest.\n\nSince the money supply is elastic, the problem of inflation (too much money in too small economy) should never happen in a mutual credit, and if it does, it indicates a failure of governance. Some systems allow the 'house' account unlimited spending, and this destroys the equilibrium, resulting either in inflation, or in recession.\n\nNational economies are biased towards fossil fuels and multinational corporations because they represent the least risk and most profit to the bank. Depending on the meaning of 'mutual' a mutual credit economy might imply that the people who give value to the money decide which endeavours deserve the privilege of credit.\n\nAnother meaning of mutuality emerges especially in small groups because any account's failure to close on zero affects the ability of others to meet their obligations. Thus if a member is struggling, then an onus is placed on other members to help out or be lenient, because a default reduces the spending power or liquidity of the currency for everyone.\n\nIn conventional money systems there are considerable ethical concerns around lending and borrowing. A comparison of punishments meted out to the troika for loan sharking and the punishment to the Greek government for defaulting on interest repayments shows that in modern times the political and moral superiority of creditors over debtors is near absolute.\n\nIn a mutual credit system, since everyone starts the same and ends the same, it doesn't matter who is 'ahead' or 'behind' at any given moment, or even when they reciprocate, as long as they eventually do. Every transaction involves one person extending credit to another, there is a necessary moral equivalence of creditors and debtors. Similarly, just as in banking, credit is limited to the degree to which the account-holder is trusted, in mutual credit, debit is often also limited to the degree to which the account holder is trusted to spend back to zero. In mainstream economics high bank balances are rewarded (with interest), but the celebrated members of mutual credit systems are both earning and spending.\n\nMutual credit governance all stems from a single question, how much each member can be trusted. With no trust, there is no credit and therefore no transactions. But too much trust may be abused by members who are less serious about closing their accounts on zero - exactly the same as a Credit bubble. Small and egalitarian systems usually grant every account the same (positive and) negative limits. Some small systems will have a 'house' account which is collectively governed and may have greater limits. Larger systems with less trust between members, greater diversity of members or whose members' livelihoods depend on reciprocation have credit rating systems of more or less elaborate design.\n\nAn addition governance question concerns privacy. What transactions are visible to whom, and what account balances are visible to whom?\n\nPractitioners and theoreticians in the complementary currency movement have not yet offered a definition of mutual credit, (The place to do it would be the ) and while credit is well enough understood, just what is mutual is wide open to interpretation, it could be:\n\nMoney is much more than a record of what we have spent and earned. Though the definition of money itself is highly contentious, it is usually important that it be generally exchanged for useful things. What makes a mutual credit accounting system, into something like a money system is the contractual obligation of account holders to close all accounts at zero, which is to say, to depart the system neither owing nor owed.\nThe credit theory of money says clearly that money does not need to be, or be backed by, commodities like gold. Mutual credit systems can perform, reasonably well, all of the three classical functions of money, as store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. And while some heterodox economists such as Silvio Gesell argue that money should not even be used as a store of value, as a medium of exchange, mutual credit is unrivalled:\nNote that since mutual credit transactions do not involve the movement of a commodity, are by nature both traceable and reversible, in contrast to say, cash or Bitcoin.\n\nThere are three main social institutions said to use mutual credit today, trade exchanges, local exchange trading systems, and timebanking associations, each with a number of offshoots and variations, and their own understanding of what mutual credit means.\n\n"}

It involves using green parakeets which are trained to pick up Tarot like fortune cards. The parakeets are trained specifically for this. \n\nA parrot astrologer/fortune teller typically sits beneath a tree to call or by the side of the road where people congregate in numbers. He has a cage which contains one or two trained parrots. The tarot like cards are either spread out or stacked in front of him. They are 27 in number representing the Indian cosmic system. Each card contains the image of a Hindu deity and some cards contain images of Buddha or Virgin Mary with Infant Jesus. When a patron sits before the fortune teller, the latter opens the cage and lets the parrot out. He instructs the parrot to pick a card for the patron. The parrot walks over to the cards, picks one from the stack or the spread with its beak and gives it to the astrologer. It then walks back inside its cage. The astrologer opens the card and based on the image tells the fortune of the patron.\n\nThe practice of Parrot astrology is diminishing in Tamil Nadu due to lack of patronage. In Singapore it is a tourist attraction in Little India along the Serangoon Road. A variant is practiced in Pakistan.\n\n"}

They located the causes of Māori and Pacific Island oppression within the exploitative social relations of capitalism. Consequently, the Polynesian Panthers promoted a strategy of liberation based on the complete overthrow of the capitalist system and the social relations necessary for its development. The group greatly increased in profile during Rob Muldoon's immigration scare campaign in 1975, and the subsequent dawn raids under his administration.\n\nThe Polynesian Panther Movement was founded in inner city Auckland by six young Pacific Islander men: Fred Schmidt, Nooroa Teavae, Paul Dapp, Vaughan Sanft, Eddie Williams and Will 'Ilolahia. At the time many Pacific Island youth were supporters of Māori political initiatives such as the Bastion Point occupation and Waitangi Day protests, and gained skills in political lobbying and processes which they used to raise the profile of Pacific people in New Zealand. Because of the working-class background of its members the movement concerned itself with issues relating to unequal pay and unsatisfactory working conditions.\n\nHeadquarters were established in Ponsonby and the Polynesian Panthers began to organise activities, among them were homework centres for Pacific children, visiting Pacific prisoners as well as providing transport for their families to visit, and running programs educating Pacific Islanders on their rights as New Zealand citizens. Soon the movement expanded nationally with chapters in South Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin, as well as a chapter in Sydney, Australia.\n\nOne of the notable early members of the Polynesian Panthers include Niuean composer, musician and activist Tigilau Ness, who was imprisoned during anti-apartheid protests in New Zealand aimed at stopping the controversial 1981 South African Springboks rugby tour. Ness is also the father of New Zealand hip hop artist Che Fu.\n\nIn 2006 Panther members released a book to mark the 35th anniversary of the Polynesian Panther movement.\n\nOn 12 September 2009 the Polynesian Panthers held a special evening in Auckland to honour American Black Panther revolutionary artist Emory Douglas during his International Artist in Residency at Auckland University's Elam School of Fine Arts.\n\nIn 2010 a documentary film made by Nevak 'Ilolahia (niece of Will 'Ilolahia), was released telling the story of the Polynesian Panthers. It was shown on Māori Television's New Zealand documentary slot. A Facebook page shares news and events related to the Polynesian Panthers and showings of the documentary.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14464535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14464535", "title": "Prostitution in Costa Rica", "text": "Prostitution in Costa Rica\n\nProstitution in Costa Rica is legal. Costa Rica's legal system is based on Roman law rather than common law, and so for prostitution to be illegal it would have to be explicitly stated as such in a penal code, and it is not. Nevertheless, many of the activities surrounding it are illegal, as the law forbids promoting or facilitating the prostitution of another, and therefore pimping, brothels, or prostitution rings are illegal. Prostitution is common and is practiced openly throughout the country, particularly in popular tourism destinations.\n\nThe large growth in sex tourism prompted the Government of Costa Rica introduce a voluntary registration scheme for prostitutes. Prostitutes who register with the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS) carry an ID card and are entitled to a free health check every 15 days. They are also receive support and assistance There are estimated to be 15,000 prostitutes in the country. Many of them are from Colombia, Nicaragua, Argentina, Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries.\n\nThere is a red-light district in the capital, San José, known as Gringo Gulch.\n\nSex trafficking, child prostitution and HIV are problems in the country\n\nSex tourism in Costa Rica has been a consequence of the rapid growth of international tourism in the country, and the country is being promoted as a popular destination for sex tourism. Despite the government and industry efforts, child sex trade has been also a problem. A study estimated that \"up to 10% of tourists who come to Costa Rica engage in sex tourism\", with as many as 10,000 sex workers involved, many of whom are immigrants. Also it was reported that about 80% of the sex tourists are from the US. This is largely because[prostitution is not illegal but many of the activities surrounding it are indeed illegal, such as pimping.\n\nCosta Rica first began development of its tourism industry with the creation of the first private hotel, the Gran Hotel Costa Rica, in 1930. Generally, tourists came from overseas, entering the country through the Port of Limón, then commuting to San José by train. On June 16, 1931, Law 91 was passed, creating the National Tourism Board, which operated until it was replaced by the Instituto Costarricense de Turismo on August 9, 1955.\n\nCurrently, tourism ranks as Costa Rica’s second highest source of revenue. In 2000, revenue from tourism accounted for 21% of Costa Rica’s total exports. Increasingly, Costa Rica is becoming reliant upon tourism as a source of income; the number of tourists arrivals in 2000 had more than doubled compared to the number of tourists only a decade earlier.\n\nRecently, Interpol named Costa Rica the fastest-growing capital for sex tourism in Latin America. Jacó and San José are two of Costa Rica’s most prominent sex tourism locations. Money made by prostitutes is enough to keep the majority of Jacó’s businesses open during the off season, as it provides a significant economic supplement. Americans are the majority of Costa Rica’s sex tourists, composing 80% of the total number of tourists.\n\nStreet violence in Costa Rica is on the rise, and prostitutes are particularly at risk. Acts of violence committed towards prostitutes often go ignored. The issue of violence towards prostitutes is not an issue that goes unnoticed by policy-makers and physicians. Rather, many choose to disregard the plight of these women. Women seeking medical treatment or asylum are generally ignored and thought to be deserving of the violence they suffer. Physicians and doctors who were interviewed openly admitted to disliking prostitutes, with one physician stating these women are \"an embarrassment to the country\".\n\nPolice officials have expressed a dislike of prostitutes, and are, according to the accounts of some prostitutes, guilty of committing acts of violence, discrimination, and harassment towards prostitutes themselves. Examples of this include rape, false accusations, disinterest in complaints about abuse, and illegal detention.\n\nAccording to \"Transvida\", an organisation which is dedicated to defend the rights of the transsexual population, trans women who are sex workers in San José, mostly work in 2 defined areas, in 2016. One of those areas centers around \"Parque Morazán\" and the Costa Rica Institute of Technology and the other one around the \"Ministry Of Public Works & Transport\" and the Hospital Clínica Bíblica.\n\nIn June 2016, transwomen who are sex workers in San José have denounced insults and violence (such as attacks involving stones and BB gun pellets) committed against them, in a local newspaper. The newspaper article included pictures showing multiple BB gun injuries (pellets penetrated inside the bodies), as well as video interviews with the trans women sex workers.\n\nIn another newspaper article, which appeared in the same edition of the newspaper, it was made clear that, since 2015, there had also been 14 complaints filed with the Judicial Investigation Department against officers for abusing their authority against trans women. Twelve of those accusations were against officials of the \"Fuerza Pública\" (an policing instance); one against the Judicial Investigation Department; and one against the municipal police.\n\nAn estimated 13,800 people were living with HIV/AIDS in Costa Rica in 2016. Traditionally, tourism has been cited as a contributor to the spread of HIV, and other such Sexually transmitted diseases. Research has linked sex tourism to the transmission of HIV between worker and client. Teenagers and young adults are the most at risk for infection; presently, people ages 15 to 24 account for over 10% of the number of HIV infected individuals living in Costa Rica.\n\nSince the diagnosis of the first case of HIV in Costa Rica in 1984, the country has run aggressive HIV/AIDS awareness programs. In addition to this, the government has fought to reduce the cost of drugs needed to treat HIV/AIDS patients; since 2003, the government has purchased generic drugs for a much lower cost than other, brand-name drugs. The Roman Catholic Church, however, has opposed the Costa Rican Ministry of Public Health’s efforts to institute HIV prevention and sex education programs. The Church believes that married couples are not at risk for infection because adultery is prohibited. In addition, they feel that the campaign for increased condom use and sex education programs interfere with “Divine Rule.”\n\nProstitutes often associate HIV/AIDS infection with violent behavior. The prostitutes interviewed showed a unique and incorrect understanding of HIV/AIDS, in that it was inextricably linked to violence. Prostitutes see violent men as potential sources of infection, by HIV as well as other diseases such as hepatitis.\n\nWhile sex tourism is embraced in Costa Rica due to its economic benefits, there are limits to what is considered lawful conduct. Sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems resulting from the rapid expansion of the sex tourism industry that the Costa Rican government has sought to remedy. Recently, the Costa Rican government announced the approval of legislation by congress that would increase penalties for trafficking and related activities. The law also creates a fund designed to combat human trafficking. Minister of the Presidency, Carlos Ricardo Benavides, asserted that \"Costa Rica sets a good example\" though the implementation of this law, and that human trafficking \"must be fought by all possible means.\"\n\nCosta Rica is a destination for child sex tourism, even though the main source of clients was local, as reported by Tapiana Tregar, CEO of Fundacion Procal (a local NGO attempting to prevent and treat violence against women and children) in a 2000 article. In the same article, Bruce Harris, regional director of Casa Alianza (the Latin American branch of international child care agency Covenant House) said that; even though child prostitution was identified across Central America, the problem seemed to be more \"out of control\" in Costa Rica. Exact numbers of the children involved were unknown at the time, and the government of Costa Rica had not gathered detailed statistics.\n\nCosta Rican Congresswoman Gloria Bejerano cites globalization as one of the factors halting attempts to cease child prostitution, as access to communication and media technologies is widespread. While production and distribution of child pornography is a punishable offense, possession of such materials is not.\n\nThe sexual exploitation of children is a significant issue in Costa Rica, and has drawn the attention of the public. Many sex tourists prefer to target children, believing that they are less likely to be infected with HIV. However, children are more susceptible to HIV infection than other age groups. The governmental organization Alianza por tus Derechos (“Alliance for your rights”) pushes for the implementation of new, harsher laws to coincide with the heinousness of the crimes being committed. Very few instances of child prostitution are actually reported to authorities due to the poor categorization of these crimes in legislation. Since 2004 the government and the tourism industry have implemented several initiatives to curb child prostitution, including education campaigns among tourist industry workers to report any illicit activity regarding minors. Anyone convicted of buying sex from a minor can suffer prison terms of up to 10 years.\n\nChild prostitution is widespread. Street children in the urban areas of San José, Limon, and Puntarenas are particularly at risk. Costa Rica is a transit and destination point for minors and women trafficked most often for commercial sexual exploitation. Most trafficking victims originate from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.\n\nSince 2004, the government and the tourism industry have implemented several initiatives to curb child prostitution, including education campaigns among tourist industry workers to report any illicit activity regarding minors. Anyone convicted of buying sex from a minor can suffer a prison term of up to 10 years.\n\nDespite attempts by Costa Rican authorities to improve the situation in Costa Rica, their efforts have had little to no effect. Such efforts were the Law Against Organized Crime in 2009, and the Law for Protection of Victims and Witnesses in 2010. Immigration and the District Attorney’s office assert that efforts thus far have been inadequate, as there have only been two human trafficking cases ending in a strict sentence since the passing of these laws. Lawmakers have since redoubled their efforts, unanimously approving the Law Against Human Trafficking, which would raise the maximum penalty of human trafficking to 16 years.\n\nChildren find themselves involved in the sex trade through a number of different circumstances: families seeking a better life for their children are tricked by offers from pimps, who later abuse and drug the children to the point of submissiveness, or they can be sold into the trade by neighbors, relatives, or people they considered friends. Abandoned and afraid, these children seldom find their way back home, and the ones who do are usually ostracized from society. In 2016, the phenomenon of fathers \"renting\" their daughters as child prostitutes has been called common in Limón Province, but occurred throughout the country. The Ministry of Health of Costa Rica regretted that some citizens of Costa Rica do not denounce this practice.\n\nAccording to the 2017 Costa Rica Trafficking in Persons Report, “Costa Rica is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking.” Trafficking victims from other countries sometimes pass through Costa Rica on their way to other destinations in Central and South America. Girls are trafficked from Costa Rica to work as prostitutes in the United States, Canada, and Europe. High profits contribute to human trafficking being an enduring problem. In some cases, earnings of up to $10,000 have been reported for a single trafficking victim. With an estimated 25 to 40 people being trafficked into and out of Costa Rica per week, human trafficking is a large source of revenue. Minors and women trafficked most often for commercial sexual exploitation, and most trafficking victims originate from Colombia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Guatemala.\n\nIn the past few years, 76 victims of human trafficking operations have been rescued in Costa Rica. However, it is nearly impossible to know just how many victims of human trafficking there are in the country. For each person rescued from a human trafficking operation, there are at least 20 cases that go unreported, according to Costa Rican immigration authorities. This estimate places the number of trafficking victims in Costa Rica in the past few years somewhere around 1,500.\n\nDespite attempts by Costa Rican authorities to improve the situation in Costa Rica, their efforts have had little to no effect. Such efforts were the \"Law Against Organized Crime\" in 2009, and the \"Law for Protection of Victims and Witnesses\" in 2010. Immigration and the district attorney’s office assert that efforts thus far have been inadequate, as there have only been two human trafficking cases ending in a strict sentence since the passing of these laws. Lawmakers have since redoubled their efforts, unanimously approving the Law Against Human Trafficking, which would raise the maximum penalty of human trafficking to 16 years.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Costa Rica as a 'Tier 2' country.\n\nThe United Nations has been an extremely active force in efforts to prevent human trafficking and child sex tourism in Latin American countries. Article 34 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child addresses children’s fundamental right to be protected from sexual exploitation. The CRC was introduced in 1989 and is currently ratified by all but two of the world’s nations. In 2000, an Optional Protocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography was introduced. Many of the articles in the CRC concern the sexual exploitation of children, and the rights of children to be protected from such activities.\n\nIn 1999, the International Labour Organization Convention coordinated massive efforts to eradicate many forms of child labor, including the sale and trafficking of children, as well as the sexual exploitation of children for pornography or prostitution.\n\nMany countries sought to strengthen existing laws regarding the exploitation of children. Facing pressure from various child welfare groups, the United States passed the PROTECT Act in April 2003. The act made it illegal for U.S. citizens to travel to another country to have sex, or to conspire to have sex, with a minor. The law also raised the maximum sentence of individuals who either engaged in, or attempted to engage in, sex with a minor to 30 years.\n\nSince 2004, World Vision, a Christian humanitarian organization operating in nearly 100 countries, has run a campaign to prevent child sex tourism, and to raise awareness of legislation regarding child sex tourism. Under the slogan “‘Abuse a child in this country, go to jail in yours,’” World Vision launched a campaign to deter child sex tourists in Cambodia, Thailand, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Brazil. The campaign, termed the Child Sex Tourism Prevention Project, was conducted in cooperation with various U.S. government agencies. The project sought to deter sex tourists through various in-flight advertisements and brochure, billboard, and other media warning sex tourists that they are subject to prosecution.\n\nAlso in 2004, the World Tourism Organization (WTO), in conjunction with ECPAT and UNICEF, headed an effort to encourage American travel agencies to abide by a code of conduct. Under the code, hotel and travel companies commit to establishing a policy against commercial sexual exploitation of children.\n\n"}

It is often thought that the main abused substances are illegal drugs and alcohol; however it is becoming more common that prescription drugs and tobacco are a prevalent problem.\n\nSubstance-related disorders, including both substance dependence and substance abuse, can lead to large societal problems. It is found to be greatest in individuals ages 18–25, with a higher likelihood occurring in men compared to women, and urban residents compared to rural residents. On average, general medical facilities hold 20% of patients with substance-related disorders, possibly leading to psychiatric disorders later on. Over 50% of individuals with substance-related disorders will often have a \"dual diagnosis,\" where they are diagnosed with the substance abuse, as well as a psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being major depression, personality disorder, anxiety disorders, and dysthymia.\n\nCommon symptoms include:\n\nThere are many more symptoms such as physical and psychological changes, though this is often dependent on which drug is being abused. It is, however, common that abusers will experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if the drug is taken away from them.\n\nIt is also reported that others have strong cravings even after they have not used the drug for a long period of time. This is called being \"clean\". To determine how the brain triggers these cravings, multiple tests have been done on mice. It is also now thought that these cravings can be explained by substance-related disorders as a subcategory of personality disorders as classified by the DSM-5.\n\nSubstance-related disorders were originally subcategorized into \"substance use disorders\" (SUD) and \"substance-induced disorders\" (SID). Though DSM-IV makes a firm distinction between the two, SIDs often occur in the context of SUDs.\n\nSubstance-induced disorders include medical conditions that can be directly attributed to the use of a substance. These conditions include intoxication, withdrawal, substance-induced delirium, substance-induced psychosis, and substance-induced mood disorders.\n\nSubstance use disorders include substance abuse and substance dependence. In DSM-IV, the conditions are formally diagnosed as one or the other, but it has been proposed that DSM-V combine the two into a single condition called \"Substance-use disorder\".\n\nThe more recently published DSM-5 combined substance abuse and substance dependence into a single continuum; this is simply known as substance use disorder and requires more presenting symptoms before a diagnosis is made. It also considers each different substance as its own separate disorder, based upon the same basic criteria. It also distinguishes the difference between dependence and addictions as two separate disorders, not to be confused.\n\nThere are many potential complications that can arise due to substance abuse such as severe physiological damage, psychological changes and social changes that are often not desirable.\n\nPhysiological damage is often the most obvious, observed as an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism: For instance, there are several known alcohol-induced diseases (e.g. alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, alcoholic cardiomyopathy.) Substance abuse is also often associated with premature ageing, fertility complications, brain damage and a higher risk of infectious diseases due to a weakened immune system.\n\nLong term abuse has been linked to personality changes such as depression, paranoia, anxiety which can be related to psychological disorders. It is often reported that substance abuse coincides with personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder. It has also now been linked to severe brain damage leading to an inability to control behaviours, which could explain why many people who abuse substances go on to develop addictions.\n\nSubstance abuse is often regarded as negative in society and therefore those who engage in such behaviours can often be subject to social discrimination. The use of many drugs can lead to criminal convictions, whether the drug itself is illegal or abusers use unlawful methods to fund their substances. It is also more likely that someone will partake in criminal or anti-social behaviour when they are under the influence of a drug.\n\n"}

{"id": "16013178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16013178", "title": "Women in Ethiopia", "text": "Women in Ethiopia\n\nThere have been several studies concerning women in Ethiopia. Historically, elite women in Ethiopia have been visible as administrators and warriors. This never translated into any benefit to improve the rights of women, but it had meant that women could inherit and own property, and act as advisors on important communal matters. As late as the first part of the nineteenth century, Queen Menen, consort of Emperor Iyasu IV, had a decisive role in running the Ethiopian Empire. Workit and Mestayit regents to their minor sons have been held responsible for their provinces. They owed their rights to property because of a special type of land tenure that expected tenants to serve as militia to overlords, irrespective of gender. Women in the ensuing period continued in traditional family and household roles, working in the homestead, raising children, and preparing the ingredients for traditional Ethiopian cuisine. More recently, there has been a steady increase in female representation in education, politics and other fields.\n\nAs in other traditional societies, in Ethiopia a woman's worth is measured in terms of her role both as a mother and wife. Over 85 percent of Ethiopian women reside in rural areas, where households are engaged primarily in subsistence agriculture. In the countryside, women are integrated into the rural economy, which is often labor-intensive and exacts a heavy physical toll on all, including children. The Ethiopian Revolution had little impact on the lives of rural women. Land reform did not change their socioeconomic status, which was anchored in deep-rooted traditional values and beliefs. An improvement in economic conditions would improve the standard of living of women, but lasting change would also require a transformation in the attitudes of government officials and men regarding the roles of women.\n\nIn urban areas, women have greater access to education, health care and employment outside the home. According to a 1976 government survey, around 40 percent of employed women in urban areas worked in the service sector, mainly in hotels, restaurants, and bars. A few women with higher education also found professional employment. Employment in production and related areas (such as textiles and food processing) accounted for 25 percent of the female work force, followed by sales, which accounted for about 11 percent. The survey also found that women factory workers in Addis Ababa earned about a quarter of the wages men earned for the same type of work. These differences existed despite a 1975 proclamation stipulating equal pay for equal work for men and women.\n\nFollowing the Ethiopian Revolution, women made some gains in economic and political areas. The Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association (REWA), which claimed a membership of over 5 million, took an active part in educating women. It encouraged the creation of women's organizations in factories, local associations, and in the civil service. Some women participated in local organizations and in peasant associations and kebeles. However, the role of women was limited at the national level. In 1984, for example, the government selected only one woman as a full member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Ethiopia. Of the 2,000 delegates who attended the party's inaugural congress in 1984, only 6 percent were women.\n\nUnder the Derg, the enrollment of girls in primary and secondary schools increased from about 32 percent in 1974/75 to 39 percent in 1985/86; the enrollment rate among girls in urban areas far exceeded that of girls in rural areas. The adult literacy rate also rose to 60 percent following a nationwide educational campaign. After the Derg's ouster, the adult literacy rate dropped to around 39 percent as of 2007; 28.9% for females and 49.1% for males. In response, the Ministry of Education launched a new educational campaign, which targets an eventual literacy rate of 95 percent and aims to educate 17 million adults. As of 2008-2009, there was a steady increase in general enrollment and a decrease in gender disparity in access to education. The average annual growth rate of enrollment in all levels education was 27.2 percent for females and 33.7 percent for males, with an average annual growth rate of 29.7 percent for girls in Kindergarten, 13.4 percent for girls in primary school, 30.8 percent for girls in secondary school, 14.5 percent for women in TVET, and 21.4 percent for women in higher education.\n\nAfter the formation of the Federal Republic in 1995, the Ministry of Women's Affairs was also established. As of October 2009, Muferiat Kamil serves as the Minister.\n\nThe total fertility rate as of 2014 is 5.23 children born/woman. Although most women do not traditionally use contraception, there has been a marked increase in contraceptive use in the last decade; between 2000 and 2011, contraceptive prevalence increased from 8.2% to 28.6%. As of 2010, the maternal mortality is 350 deaths/100,000 live births.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS rate for both genders was estimated at 1.3% in 2012. More women are infected than men, and infections among women are partly due to their often lower socioeconomic status. Since sex between spouses is traditionally regarded as an obligation, the UNFPA argues that married women are at a greater risk of contracting HIV as they have less control over the frequency and nature of such relations.\n\nAn UN analysis of several international studies suggests that domestic violence against women is most prevalent in Ethiopia. Sexual violence is also reportedly common. However, Article 620 of the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia, defines rape differently as compelled \"sexual intercourse outside wedlock\". Article 53 of the 2000 Revised Family Code of Ethiopia also stipulates that \"they [the wife and husband] shall have with one another the sexual relations normal in marriage unless these relations involve a risk of seriously prejudicing their health\". This is interpreted as rendering marital rape a legally impossible concept. According to a 2005 WHO study, 59% of women reported lifetime sexual abuse by a partner, while one third of women reported that during the past 12 months they were physically forced to have sex against their will with their partner. This was the highest prevalence of all countries surveyed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, as of 2005, 74.3% of women aged 15 – 49 years had undergone female genital mutilation (FGM). The pre-marital custom is mainly endemic to Northeast Africa and parts of the Near East and has its ultimate origins in Ancient Egypt. Although legally proscribed under Articles 565 and 566 of the 2004 Penal Code, the procedure is still widely practiced, as it is deeply ingrained in the local culture. Encouraged and performed by women in the community, circumcision is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.\n\nBride kidnapping is practiced by certain communities in Ethiopia, mainly in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region (SNNPR). According to surveys conducted in 2003 by the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, the custom's prevalence rate in the SNNPR was estimated at 92 percent. However, the 2004 Criminal Code criminalizes this practice, as well as other forms of abuse of women, such as child marriage, trafficking and sexual harassment, at \"Chapter III – Crimes Committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices\" (Articles 561–570) and also by other provisions (Articles 587, 597, 625, 635, 637, 648). Wife-beating is also illegal: \"Article 564 – Violence Against a Marriage Partner or a Person Cohabiting in an Irregular Union\".\n\nThe 2014 gang rape and death of Hanna Lalango, as well as several other contemporaneous high-profile sexual assaults, prompted outrage from women in Ethiopia and internationally. The Yellow Movement was founded as a response to encourage women to speak out against sexual violence.\n\nGender equality has been a problem in Ethiopia for decades but has had an improvement over the past three years since when Mulatu Teshome became president. The USAID is one of the worldwide countries that have done a lot in promoting women in Ethiopia and giving them an opportunity to live a better life without discrimination. Other international organizations working with Ethiopia include All African Women For Peace (AAWP) and many others part of the UN keeping their focus on advancing the participation of women in peacemaking and strive to stop early marriages and gender-based violence. In addition to the international help and participation, the Ethiopian government has also created some organizations such as the Ethiopian Women Association (EWA) which mainly focuses on stopping some dangerous cultural practises done against women and girls like FGM which involves removing some parts of their private parts and promoting their economic, social and legal rights. The Ethiopians as individuals have also created smaller local organizations such the Women Fight in Harar, a small city in Ethiopia who have lately been trying to fight any parents who keep their from school and putting shame to men who attack, rape or try to rape girls and women. \nFurthermore, Ethiopian girls and women’s struggles and problems are mostly associated with social acceptance, access to education and child or forced marriages. To many, it seems the tragedy begins immediately when they are born because when a mother gives birth to a baby girl, the baby is considered as something unwanted but celebrations are made when a baby boy is born. Being taken as the weak creatures, parents give various excuses to keep their daughters at home doing housework instead of going to school. A school age girl won’t be allowed to attend school with an excuse that she may be raped, abducted or harmed on the way to school and on the other hand, boys are considered strong enough to protect themselves from any attack or harm. Girls also can’t choose when and who to get married to. “Either the parents will choose the bride, or the groom will marry the girl of his choice” (Womankind). Though these issues are pretty serious, the worst part of their social acceptance is that a woman who is a victim of rape will face humiliation starting from the police. Rape is not taken seriously and hence men are seen committing several atrocious violence against women, especially in villages. \n\n"}

World maps form a distinctive category of maps due to the problem of projection. Maps by necessity distort the presentation of the earth's surface. These distortions reach extremes in a world map. The many ways of projecting the earth reflect diverse technical and aesthetic goals for world maps.\n\nWorld maps are also distinct for the global knowledge required to construct them. A meaningful map of the world could not be constructed before the European Renaissance because less than half of the earth's coastlines, let alone its interior regions, were known to any culture. New knowledge of the Earth's surface has been accumulating ever since and continues to this day.\n\nMaps of the world generally focus either on political features or on physical features. Political maps emphasize territorial boundaries and human settlement. Physical maps show geographic features such as mountains, soil type or land use. Geological maps show not only the surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, fault lines, and subsurface structures. Choropleth maps use color hue and intensity to contrast differences between regions, such as demographic or economic statistics.\n\nA map is made using a map projection, which is any method of representing a globe on a plane. All projections distort distances and directions, and each projection distributes those distortions differently. Perhaps the most well known projection is the Mercator Projection, originally designed as a nautical chart.\n\nA thematic map shows geographic information about one or a few focused subjects. These maps \"can portray physical, social, political, cultural, economic, sociological, agricultural, or any other aspects of a city, state, region, nation, or continent\".\n\nEarly world maps cover depictions of the world from the Iron Age to the Age of Discovery and the emergence of modern geography during the early modern period. Old maps provide much information about what was known in times past, as well as the philosophy and cultural basis of the map, which were often much different from modern cartography. Maps are one means by which scientists distribute their ideas and pass them on to future generations.\n\n\n\n"}
