He is best known for his collaborations with the composer Harry Warren.\n\nAl Dubin came from a Russian Jewish family that emigrated to the United States from Switzerland when he was two years old. He grew up in Philadelphia. Between ages of thirteen and sixteen, Dubin played hookey from school in order to travel into New York City to see Broadway musical shows. At age 14 he began writing special material for a vaudeville entertainer on 28th Street between 5th and Broadway in New York City, otherwise known as Tin Pan Alley.\n\nDubin was accepted and enrolled at Perkiomen Seminary in September 1909, but was expelled in 1911, after writing their Alma Mater (song). After leaving Perkiomen, Dubin got himself a job as a singing waiter at a Philadelphia restaurant. He continued to write lyrics and tried selling them to area publishing firms. During this time, Dubin met composer Joe Burke. Together they wrote the song \"Oh, You, Mister Moon\" (1911), which was published by M. Witmark & Sons.\n\nIn 1917, Dubin was drafted at Camp Upton in Yaphank, Long Island, and served as a private in the 305th Field Artillery of the 77th Division, known as New York's own. During his service, he wrote the song \"They Didn’t Think We'd Do it, But We Did\" with composer Fred Rath and published by the 77th Division. On his first weekend pass, Dubin went to see a show at the Majestic Theater in New York City. There he met Broadway singer Helen McClay. They were married on March 19, 1921, at the Church of St. Elizabeth in New York City, after Dubin converted to the Catholic faith and McClay was granted an annulment of her first marriage. The year they married, Dubin was accepted in ASCAP in 1921.\n\nKnown for his larger-than-life persona, Dubin struggled with alcohol and drugs, and fell on hard times in the 1940s. Estranged from his wife, Dubin struggled to find work both in Hollywood and New York. The last show Dubin was contracted to work on was \"Laffing Room Only\", with composer Burton Lane. Dubin provided only a title for this production, \"Feudin' and a Fightin'\", for which he received 25 percent credit.\n\nDubin spent the remainder of the last few years of his life at the Empire Hotel, alone and in ill-health. On February 8, 1945, he collapsed on the street after having taken a large quantity of doctor-prescribed barbiturates. He was admitted to the Roosevelt Hospital for barbiturate poisoning and pneumonia, and later died on February 11, 1945. Famed newspaper personality Walter Winchell made the announcement of his death on the radio.\n\nOn his passing, Dubin was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.\n\nDubin sold his first set of lyrics for two songs \"Prairie Rose\" and \"Sunray\", in 1909 to the Whitmark Music Publishing Firm.\n\nIn 1925, Dubin met the composer Harry Warren, who was to become his future collaborator at Warner Bros. studio in Hollywood. The first song they collaborated on was titled, \"Too Many Kisses in the Summer Bring Too Many Tears in the Fall\". But it was another song written with Joseph Meyer that same year that became Dubin's first big hit, \"A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You\".\n\nWarner Bros. purchased the publishing firms of Witmark, Remick and Harms, and since Dubin was under contract to Harms, Warner Bros. inherited his services. In 1929 Dubin wrote \"Tiptoe through the Tulips\" with composer Joe Burke for the film \"Gold Diggers of Broadway\".\n\nIn 1932, Dubin teamed officially with composer Harry Warren on the movie musical \"42nd Street\", starring Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Warner Baxter and Bebe Daniels, with dance routines sequenced by legendary choreographer Busby Berkeley. The songwriting team of Warren and Dubin contributed four songs: \"42nd Street\", \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me\", \"Young and Healthy\" and \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\".\n\nBetween 1932 and 1939, Dubin and Warren wrote 60 hit songs for several Warner Bros. movie musicals, including \"Gold Diggers of 1933\", \"Footlight Parade\" starring James Cagney, \"Roman Scandals\" starring Eddie Cantor, \"Dames\", \"Go Into Your Dance\" and \"Wonder Bar\", both starring Al Jolson. The song \"Lullaby of Broadway\", written by Warren and Dubin for the musical film, \"Gold Diggers of 1935\", won the 1936 Academy Award for Best Original Song.\n\nIn 1980, producer David Merrick and director Gower Champion adapted the 1933 film \"42nd Street\" into a Broadway musical that won The Tony Award for Best Musical in 1981. The book for the show was written by Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble and featured a score that incorporated Warren and Dubin songs from various movie musicals including \"42nd Street\", \"Dames\", \"Go Into Your Dance\", \"Gold Diggers of 1933\" and \"Gold Diggers of 1935\".\n\nDubin was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is very close to the Oware game that spread to the Americas with the atlantic slave trade. Among modern mancalas, which are most often derived from Warri, the Kalah is a notable one that has essentially the same rules as Ayoayo.\n\nThere are games with identical rules also in other areas of Africa. One such game is the Endodoi, played by the Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nThe Ayoayo board is composed of two roles of six holes each, and 48 seeds are used; at the beginning, 4 seeds are placed in each hole. These are exactly the same equipment and setup as those of Warri and many other 2-row mancalas such as Layli Goobalay. Each player owns one of the rows.\n\nAt his or her turn, the player takes all seeds from one of his holes and relay sows them counterclockwise; during each individual sowing, the starting hole is skipped (i.e., no seeds are dropped there even if more than 12 seeds are to be sown). When the last seed is sown in an empty hole, and if this hole belongs to the player in turn, he or she will capture any seed in the opposing hole.\n\nWhen one of the players cannot move anymore, the game is over. The opponent captures all the seeds that are left on the board and the winner is the player who captured most seeds.\n\nNotice that if a player ends his or her turn with no seeds left in his or her row, the opponent \"must\" (if it is possible) choose his move in such a way to bring one or more seeds into the other's row. This scheme is found in many mancalas and sometimes referred to as \"feeding\" the opponent (i.e., save the opponent from starving).\n\n"}

According to the 2016 national census, there were 38,490 Canadian Cambodians, making them one of the smallest minority groups of Asian ancestry in the country.\n\nAside from Khmer, Canadian French and English, many Cambodian Canadians also speak Standard French, due to France's colonization and historical influence on Cambodia, when French was designated as an official language. Theravada Buddhism and Roman Catholicism are the two major religions among Cambodian Canadians.\n\nDuring the Khmer Rouge genocide of 1975-1979, Cambodians of many ethnic backgrounds escaped to refugee camps in the neighboring countries of Thailand and Vietnam. Due to the mass number of refugees, many Cambodians migrated to Canada, USA, France and Australia. In 1981, there were 13,000 Cambodian-Canadian Refugees, with most of the population settling into major cities such as Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Quebec City. The Jane and Finch neighbourhood of Toronto has a notably large Cambodian population, in which they make up about 4% of the community. By 2016, the number of Cambodians in Canada had risen to 38,490.\n\nCambodians are formally known as Theravada Buddhists, but follow a mix of a cultural adaptation of Buddhism and ancient religious views and principles. Ever since Cambodia was under French colonization, the number of Christian followers among Cambodian populations has also increased, leading to several Cambodian-Christian establishments throughout Ontario. Buddhist followers however pray throughout the year, with the celebration of Khmer New Year lasting three days centered around the 13th of April.\n\nThe religious festival of Pchum Ben, also known as Ancestor's Day, is the remembrance of the deceased. On this day is when Cambodians pay their respects to deceased relatives and ancestors. On Ancestor's day, people would offer food to the monks, who would then give their blessings to the people and their ancestors. The significance of food to this festival correlates with the belief that the ghosts of their ancestors will receive it.\n\nIn 1979, members of the Cambodian-Canadian community established the CCAO (Cambodian-Canadian Association of Ontario), alongside other notable community organizations such as the Khmer Buddhist Group.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7257", "title": "Caste", "text": "Caste\n\nCaste is a form of social stratification characterized by endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, customary social interaction, and exclusion. It is an extreme evolution of a system of legally-entrenched social classes, also endogamous and hereditary, such as that of feudal Europe. Although caste systems exist in various regions, its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today; it is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India. In biology, the term is applied to role stratification in eusocial animals like ants and termites, though the analogy is imperfect as these also involve extremely stratified reproduction.\n\nThe origins of the term 'caste' are attributed to the Spanish and Portuguese \"casta\", which, according to the John Minsheu's Spanish dictionary (1599), means \"race, lineage, or breed\". When the Spanish colonized the New World, they used the word to mean a \"clan or lineage\". It was, however, the Portuguese who first employed \"casta\" in the primary modern sense of the English word ‘caste’ when they applied it to the thousands of endogamous, hereditary Indian social groups they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498, as a direct extension of the concept of ‘casta’ in contemporary Portugal. The use of the spelling \"caste\", with this latter meaning, is first attested in English in 1613.\n\nModern India's caste system is based on the social groupings called \"jāti\" and the theoretical \"varna\". The system of \"varnas\" appears in Hindu texts dating back to 1000 BCE and envisages the society divided into four classes: Brahmins (scholars and priests), Kshatriyas (warriors and nobles), Vaishyas (farmers, merchants, and artisans) and Shudras (laborers/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in \"varna\" classification. Scholars believe that the system of \"varnas\" was a theoretical classification envisioned by the Brahmins, but never truly operational in society. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of \"jātis\" (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations. The \"jātis\" have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status. In many instances, as in Bengal, historically the kings and rulers had been called upon, when required, to mediate on the ranks of \"jātis\", which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the \"jātis\" may or may not fit into the \"varna\" classes and many prominent \"jatis\", for example the Jats and Yadavs, straddled two varnas i.e. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, and the \"varna\" status of \"jātis\" itself was subject to articulation over time.\n\nStarting with the British colonial Census of 1901 led by Herbert Hope Risley, all the \"jātis\" were grouped under the theoretical \"varnas\" categories. According to political scientist Lloyd Rudolph, Risley believed that \"varna\", however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and \"[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it.\" The terms \"varna\" (conceptual classification based on occupation) and \"jāti\" (groups) are two distinct concepts: while \"varna\" is the idealised four-part division envisaged by the Twice-Borns, \"jāti\" (community) refers to the thousands of actual endogamous groups prevalent across the subcontinent. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the \"varnas\", as it provided a convenient shorthand; but a problem arises when even Indologists sometimes confuse the two.\n\nUpon independence from Britain, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 castes across the country as Scheduled Castes in 1950, for positive discrimination. The Untouchable communities are sometimes called \"Scheduled Castes\", \"Dalit\" or \"Harijan\" in contemporary literature. In 2001, Dalits were 16.2% of India's population. Most of the 15 million bonded child workers are from the lowest castes.\n\nIndependent India has witnessed caste-related violence. In 2005, government recorded approximately 110,000 cases of reported violent acts, including rape and murder, against Dalits. For 2012, the government recorded 651 murders, 3,855 injuries, 1,576 rapes, 490 kidnappings, and 214 cases of arson.\n\nThe socio-economic limitations of the caste system are reduced due to urbanization and affirmative action. Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in endogamy and patrimony, and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalization and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. The co-existence of the middle-class and traditional members in the CPCC has created intersectionality between caste and class. There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilization of people and policy development. It is not politics that gets caste-ridden; it is caste that gets politicized.\n\nStudies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system. While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has helped the younger generation of Indians to have more control over their marriages through the use of dating apps. Hypergamy is still a common practice in India and Hindu culture. Men can marry a lower caste or a woman of an equal one. If the girl marries up, then her children will take the status of their father. If the girl marries down, her entire family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. Geographical factors also determine the loosening of the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to experience exogamous marriages, due to a lack of people within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma.\n\nThe Nepalese caste system resembles that of the Indian \"jāti\" system with numerous \"jāti\" divisions with a \"varna\" system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the Licchavi period. Jayasthiti Malla (1382–1395) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–1575). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–1636).\n\nMcKim Marriott claims a social stratification that is hierarchical, closed, endogamous and hereditary is widely prevalent, particularly in western parts of Pakistan. Frederik Barth in his review of this system of social stratification in Pakistan suggested that these are castes.\n\nThe caste system in Sri Lanka is a division of society into strata, influenced by the textbook \"varnas\" and \"jāti\" system found in India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British/Kandyan period Kadayimpoth – Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.\n\nBalinese caste structure has been described in early 20th-century European literature to be based on three categories – triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, \"dwijāti\" (twice born) in contrast to \"ekajāti\" (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently from the caste categories for India:\n\nThe Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to \"castas\" in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.\n\nDuring the period of Yuan Dynasty, ruler Kublai Khan enforced a \"Four Class System\", which was a legal caste system. The order of four classes of people was maintained by the information of the descending order were:-\n\nToday, the Hukou system is considered by various sources as the current caste system of China.\n\nThere is also significant controversy over the social classes of Tibet, especially with regards to the serfdom in Tibet controversy.\n\nIn Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merit, were rigid and highly formalized in a system called \"mibunsei\" (身分制). At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles (kuge), together with the Shōgun and daimyō. Below them, the population was divided into four classes: samurai, peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as \"furiuri\", \"tanagari\", \"mizunomi-byakusho\" among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.\n\nHowell, in his review of Japanese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.\n\nDe Vos and Wagatsuma observe that Japanese society had a systematic and extensive caste system. They discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often assumed to be different, are superficial terms, and are due to identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and elsewhere.\n\nEndogamy was common because marriage across caste lines was socially unacceptable.\n\nJapan had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracized, historically referred to by the insulting term \"Eta\", now called \"Burakumin\". While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the Buraku or Burakumin underclasses. The Burakumin are regarded as \"ostracised\". The burakumin are one of the main minority groups in Japan, along with the Ainu of Hokkaidō and those of residents of Korean and Chinese descent.\n\nThe baekjeong (백정) were an \"untouchable\" outcaste of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the Khitan invasion of Korea in the 11th century. The defeated Khitans who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion. They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads. Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.\n\nIn 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian Joseon dynasty, Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the Yangban, which literally means \"two classes\". It was composed of scholars (\"munban\") and warriors (\"muban\"). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the \"jung-in\" (중인-中人: literally \"middle people\". This was a small class of specialized professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the \"sangmin\" (상민-常民: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a serf population known as the \"nobi\". The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated, and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea. The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the Gabo Reform of 1894, but traces remained until 1930.\n\nThe opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the \"baekjeong\". However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate \"baekjeong\" into worship, with non-\"baekjeong\" finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage. Around the same time, the \"baekjeong\" began to resist open social discrimination. They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an egalitarian Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and \"commoners\", and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.\n\nWith the Gabo reform of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the Gabo government, the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal social equality, which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.\n\nWhile most Koreans by then had surnames and even bongwan, although still substantial number of cheonmin, mostly consisted of serfs and slaves, and untouchables did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term \"inmin\" (\"people\") and later, \"kungmin\" (\"citizen\").\n\nThe Committee for Human Rights in North Korea reported that \"Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life.\" Regarded as \"Songbun\", Barbara Demick describes this \"class structure\" as an updating of the hereditary \"caste system\", combining Confucianism and Stalinism. She claims that a bad family background is called \"tainted blood\", and that by law this \"tainted blood\" lasts for three generations.\n\nHeidi Fjeld has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticize a supposedly 'egalitarian' ancient Tibetan society.\n\nYezidi society is hierarchical. The secular leader is a hereditary emir or prince, whereas a chief sheikh heads the religious hierarchy. The Yazidi are strictly endogamous; members of the three Yazidi castes, the murids, sheikhs and pirs, marry only within their group.\n\nPre-Islamic Sassanid society was immensely complex, with separate systems of social organization governing numerous different groups within the empire. Historians believe society comprised four\nsocial classes:\n\n\nIn Yemen there exists a hereditary caste, the African-descended Al-Akhdam who are kept as perennial manual workers. Estimates put their number at over 3.5 million residents who are discriminated, out of a total Yemeni population of around 22 million.\n\nVarious sociologists have reported caste systems in Africa. The specifics of the caste systems have varied in ethnically and culturally diverse Africa, however the following features are common – it has been a closed system of social stratification, the social status is inherited, the castes are hierarchical, certain castes are shunned while others are merely endogamous and exclusionary. In some cases, concepts of purity and impurity by birth have been prevalent in Africa. In other cases, such as the \"Nupe\" of Nigeria, the \"Beni Amer\" of East Africa, and the \"Tira\" of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.\n\nAmong the Igbo of Nigeria – especially Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Edo and Delta states of the country – Obinna finds Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.\n\nThe \"osu\" class systems of eastern Nigeria and southern Cameroon are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the \"Osus\" people as \"owned by deities\" and outcasts.\n\nThe Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.\n\nIn a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in Ivory Coast, with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.\n\nSimilarly, the Mandé societies in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the \"jonow\" slaves as inferior. Similarly, the Wolof in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the \"geer\" (freeborn/nobles), \"jaam\" (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass \"neeno\". In various parts of West Africa, Fulani societies also have class divisions. Other castes include \"Griots\", \"Forgerons\", and \"Cordonniers\".\n\nTamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the \"Malinke\" people no later than 14th century, and was present among the \"Wolof\" and \"Soninke\", as well as some \"Songhay\" and \"Fulani\" populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the \"Sosso-Malinke\" war described in the \"Sunjata\" epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.\n\nAs West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.\n\nEthel M. Albert in 1960 claimed that the societies in Central Africa were caste-like social stratification systems. Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in Rwanda and Burundi can be best described as castes. The Tutsi, noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous Hutu and the least numerous Twa regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.\n\nIn a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the Gurage and Konso. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited. Alula Pankhurst has published a study of caste groups in SW Ethiopia.\n\nAmong the Kafa, there were also traditionally groups labeled as castes. \"Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manno). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves.\"\n\nThe Borana Oromo of southern Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the Oromo language, they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.\n\nThe traditionally nomadic Somali people are divided into clans, wherein the Rahanweyn agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the Madhiban were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts. As Gabboye, the Madhiban along with the Yibir and Tumaal (collectively referred to as \"sab\") have since obtained political representation within Somalia, and their general social status has improved with the expansion of urban centers.\n\nFor centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded Cagots who lived primarily in the Basque region of France and Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.\n\nIn July 2013, the UK government announced its intention to amend the Equality Act 2010 to \"introduce legislation on caste, including any necessary exceptions to the caste provisions, within the framework of domestic discrimination law\". Section 9(5) of the Equality Act 2010 provides that \"a Minister may by order amend the statutory definition of race to include caste and may provide for exceptions in the Act to apply or not to apply to caste\".\n\nFrom September 2013 to February 2014, Meena Dhanda led a project on \"Caste in Britain\" for the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\n\nIn view of W. Lloyd Warner relationship between Blacks and Whites in USA historically showed many features of caste like residential segregation, marriage restrictions. Discrimination based upon socio-economic factors are historically prevalent within the country. \n\nAccording to Gerald D. Berreman, in the two systems, there are rigid rules of avoidance and certain types of contacts are defined as contaminating. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis of differentiation. The caste system in India and in the United States has higher groups which desire to retain their position for themselves and thus perpetuate the system.\n\nAs a result of the increased immigration to the United States, many Indian Americans have created a similar system. A survey commissioned by Equality Labs finds that caste discrimination is playing out in the United States as well. 2/3 of the members of the lowest caste, called Dalits, said that they have faced workplace discrimination due to their caste. 41% have experienced discrimination in education because of it in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1980s, Healy worked in brothels and massage parlors.\n\nHealy and her fellow members of the NZPC initiated a campaign for decriminalisation of prostitution. Prostitution was finally decriminalised in New Zealand in 2003 after the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003; Healy was in the public gallery to witness the final vote. On 24 February 2010, she was invited by the Oxford Union at the University of Oxford to debate whether prostitution should be decriminalised. She became the second New Zealander after David Lange to be invited to debate at the university. At the university, she argued for decriminalisation of prostitution and won the debate.\n\nHealy has membership of various boards and committees. She has been invited as a speaker at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and acts as an advisory on issues and policy formulations related to prostitution.

The company calls such a system \"clean capitalism\". Founded in 2002, Corporate Knights has a media and research division, which includes the award-winning business and society magazine Corporate Knights, and a research division which produces corporate rankings, research reports and financial product ratings based on corporate sustainability performance. Its best-known rankings include the Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada and the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations. In June 2013, \"Corporate Knights\" was named \"Magazine of the Year\" by Canada's National Magazine Awards Foundation.\n\nIn addition to its two divisions, Corporate Knights Inc. spearheaded the creation in 2012 of the Council for Clean Capitalism, a multi-industry group of leading Canadian companies dedicated to advocating economic and social policy changes that reward responsible corporate behaviour and remove barriers to clean capitalism. The council's 10 members include Telus, Vancity, and Teck Resources.\n\nCorporate Knights Inc. was co-founded in 2002 by Toby A. A. Heaps and Paul Fengler. Fengler was an International Relations and Russian Language graduate, and Heaps majored in Economics and International Development. The pair created the magazine as a \"halfway house between Adbusters and Forbes\", according to Heaps.\n\nThe magazine was first published in the wake of the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom with the objective of holding companies more accountable while recognizing that \"power is where the money is, and if you want to make social change, it's through business.\" Heaps has made clear since the magazine was founded that there's no pretending that corporations are saints. \"There are no Mother Teresas here. But these are the best we've got.\" As such, two of the magazine's major goals has been to publicize positive business practices and rank the sustainability performance of companies.\n\nCK has expanded both its reach and research over the past decade.\n\n\"Corporate Knights\" magazine is a business and society publication focused on how companies, markets and governments are advancing social and environmental sustainability worldwide. Calling itself \"the magazine for clean capitalism\", it highlights and analyses trends around sustainable corporate practices and investment products. In 2012, an overhaul of the magazine's content and design was conducted. On June 6, 2013, the National Magazine Awards Foundation named \"Corporate Knights\" \"Magazine of the Year\". The publication was also nominated for having Best Feature Package and Best Artistic Package in 2012.\n\nThere are approximately 139,850 copies of \"Corporate Knights\" magazine distributed quarterly through the \"Washington Post\" and Canadian newspaper \"The Globe and Mail\". The magazine is also direct-mailed to corporate and political decision makers worldwide. Its largest presence is in North America and Europe. A digital version was launched in spring 2012 through iTunes in partnership with e-publisher PixelMags, and another 10,000 digital copies are distributed through the Globe and Mail's Globe2Go e-paper delivery service.\n\nCK Media also produces an e-newsletter and is active on social media. In 2013, the magazine launched a mobile app called CK Ranker that lets any company rank its sustainability performance and compare itself against industry peers. The magazine published its November (Winter 2013) issue on paper made from 60 per cent wheat straw, a first in North America, part of a partnership with Prairie Paper Ventures, a company co-founded by actor Woody Harrelson, who appears on the issue's cover.\n\nThe Corporate Knights research division produces corporate rankings, research reports and financial product ratings based on corporate sustainability performance. A significant portion of this research is used in the rankings and reports published in \"Corporate Knights\" magazine.\n\n\"Corporate Knights\" magazine issues annual rankings, special reports and annual awards for companies. Some of which are listed below (date indicates the year each began):\n\n\nAnnual Rankings\n\n\nIn 2005, CK started the first annual list of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations. This annual ranking is a comprehensive data driven analysis of the world's largest public firms. It has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility's Rate the Raters project. The Global 100 seeks to mainstream sustainability in the business community to demonstrate that large, successful companies in a range of industries can be fiscally responsible, financially successful and focused on sustainability.\n\n\nSince 2001, CK has published the annual list of Canada's top corporate citizens. Companies are transparently ranked on their relative carbon, water, waste and energy impacts as well as citizenship indicators including pension fund quality, board diversity, ratio of CEO-pay to lowest paid worker, and tax dollar generation, as well as sector specific indicators such as renewable energy investments (for financial companies) and respect for human rights (for resource extraction companies).\n\n\nCorporate Knights began publishing a special report on the cleantech sector in 2006, when it created its Cleantech 10 and Next 10 lists of established and up-and-coming Canadian clean technology companies. A Cleantech 10 list of U.S. companies was also created in 2012 in partnership with the Cleantech Group. In 2013 the magazine shifted gears by focusing its coverage on the Cleantech Group's Cleantech 100 list of global cleantech leaders, part of an effort to better represent its North American (and global) readership.\n\n\nThe magazine created its annual sustainability ranking of Canadian MBA schools in 2003. Called Knight Schools, the special section periodically ranked engineering and other professional schools over the years. In 2013, a decision was made to expand the ranking beyond Canada.\n\nAwards of Distinction\n\n\nThis was a one-of award. In 2006, Corporate Knights solicited the input of prominent Canadians, including Elizabeth May, Maude Barlow, Sheila Copps and Monte Hummel, to rank the environmental impact of Canadian Prime Ministers.\n\nSelected as having accomplished the most to improve Canada's environment, Brian Mulroney was honoured at an Earth Week Gala dinner in Ottawa as the 'Greenest PM in Canadian History'. The event brought together former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Quebec Premier Jean Charest, television host Ben Mulroney, US Ambassador David Wilkins and other dignitaries to recognize Mulroney's positive environmental impact. His government established the Acid Rain Accord, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the Great Lakes Action Plan, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and ratified the Montreal Protocol.\n\nCanadian comedian Rick Mercer provided commentary throughout the evening, which was broadcast live on national television.\n\nGlobal 100 Dinners\n\nAt the annual World Economic Forum in Switzerland, CK hosts the Global 100 Davos Dinner and announces the year's most sustainable companies. Each year the event has had a theme.\n\n\nBest 50 Gala\n\nThe Annual Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada are announced each summer at a gala in Toronto. Awards of distinction are also presented at this event.\n\nSpeakers at Corporate Knights events:\n\nSenior Government Representatives\n\n\nCorporate & Society Leaders\n\n\n\nCorporate Knights also undertakes initiatives to influence public policy, including a 2006 $100 billion carbon pricing plan for Canada to reach its Kyoto target, convening the first Energy Ministers' meeting on building a transcanadian grid for transporting green electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed, and the Option 13 initiative to make trade implications a central consideration of the Copenhagen meeting in November–December 2009.\n\nIn 2007 CK helped put together a working group to explore a Green Power Corridor summit.\n\nOption13 was a 2008 initiative intended to promote three choices for 2013 in the face of climate change. Ralph Nader and CK's Toby Heaps published an article about it in the \"Wall Street Journal\".\n\nIn 2010 CK supported Bill C-300 and testimony was given by Toby Heaps to support the business case for ethical mining.\n\nPrioritizing Global Reporting Initiative Indicators\n\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) created the G3 sustainability reporting guidelines as well as 14 sector-specific supplements. GRI identified these barriers to sustainable investing that must be overcome:\n\n\nG3.1 is GRI's most recent iteration of its Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.\n\nIn 2010, the Prince of Wales' Accounting for Sustainability Project (A4S) and the Global Reporting Initiative announced the formation of the International Integrated Reporting Committee (IIRC).\n\nCanadian Institute of Chartered Accountants: Environmental, Social and Governance Indicators\n\nIn 2010, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) published a report stating that mainstream institutional investors are beginning to factor environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators into their decision making.\n\nCurrent masthead\n\n\nCurrent research staff\n\n\nCorporate\n\n\nNotable contributors\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57491041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57491041", "title": "Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos", "text": "Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos\n\nCertain associates of the former Philippine president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos have benefited from their friendship with Marcos - whether in terms of legal assistance, political favours, or facilitation of business monopolies, during the latter's administration. Marcos critics, and the local and international press began referring to these individuals as \"cronies\" during the latter days of the Marcos dictatorship, and the Philippine government - especially the Presidential Commission on Good Governance (PCGG) - continued using the term after the ouster of the Marcoses in 1986.\n\nThese \"cronies\" were awarded government commissions, projects and funds, many of which were later investigated for corruption, misuse of funds, and disregard for the Philippine constitution. Marcos' cronies were given strategic positions both in the government and in private sectors, in order for the Marcoses to seize control of the major industries of the country.\n\nEnrile served the Marcos Administration under many positions. He was Commissioner of Customs in 1965, then rose to Secretary of Defense in 1970. He resigned a year later to run unsuccessfully for the senate, but he was quickly reinstated in 1972. The Marcos administration also fabricated an ambush of Enrile’s car, claiming it was done by militants. This staged act served as justification for the declaration of martial law. Enrile later admitted to the plot, revealing in a 1985 interview that the attack on his car had been faked.\n\nFor the majority of Martial Law, Enrile was in charge of all the armed forces, which were responsible for many human rights abuses and summary executions. Enrile was also involved with many cases of corruption, namely:\n\n\nBanana magnate Floirendo began his business career in Davao City in the 1940s, when he found it favorable to cultivate relationships with running politicians. He contributed to Marcos’ 1965 and 1969 presidential campaign funds, and it was in his Davao estate where Marcos launched his 1969 presidential campaign in southern Philippines.\n\nUnder the Marcos administration, Floirendo’s company Tagum Agricultural Development Company, Inc. (TADECO) leased 6,000 hectares of prime, fertile, government land and employed prison labor from the neighboring prisons. This project was formerly halted during the Macapagal Administration. It violated the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines and Philippine corporate law, which permitted only up to 1,024 land acquisition. Sen. Lorendo Tañada chaired a Blue Ribbon Committee investigation into the matter, which caused Floirendo to retreat the plan to wait for a more favorable political climate. His plan finally came into fruition after Marcos’ second term.\n\nFloirendo also served as a front for the Marcoses in purchasing international properties. With former First Lady Imelda Marcos, he purchased three condominium apartments in Olympic Tower in New York City. He purchased two expensive units at the St. James Towers in Manhattan. He purchased a $1.35 million mansion in Makiki Heights in Hawaii. The mansion, known as the Helen Knudsen estate, sits directly across the Tantoco house where the Marcoses lived in exile. He purchased the $4.5 million Lindenmere estate in Long Island New York, and a $2.5 million Beverly Hills property.\n\nFloirendo escaped the Philippines a day before Ferdinand Marcos was exiled to Hawaii. In 1987, Floirendo turned over PHP 70 million in cash to the Presidential Commission on Good Government, as well as titles for the Lindenmere Estate, the Olympic Towers apartments, and the Makiki Heights Drive property. He admitted transferring amounts of $600,000, $2 million, and $4 million to George Hamilton, an American actor involved in the Marcos’ business ties and federal fraud and racketeering cases. They were supposedly loans from Imelda Marcos, who he alleges to have ordered him these transfers. He also admitted that the Marcos-tied corporations of Ancor, Calno, Kuodo and Camelton belonged to him.\n\nEduardo “Danding” Cojuangco kept close, familial ties with the Marcoses. Aside from business and political dealings, Cojuanco and Marcos are godfathers to each other’s children — Cojuangco to Marcos’ junior, nicknamed Bongbong, and Marcos to Cojuangco’s son which he named ‘Marcos’.\n\nCojuangco, with Juan Ponce Enrile, were involved with the Coco Levy Fund Scam, which taxed small farmers with the promise of shares in the coconut investment company (Cocofund). However, farmers benefitted nothing from this levy, as the middle-men did not return receipts that proved they paid the coconut levy and were entitled to equity in the company.\n\nDue to the sudden surge of the price of coconuts in the world market, this fund became extremely profitable, amounting to as much as $785 million total profits. These funds were channeled to the private financial interests of Marcos and cronies and was consolidated in the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB).\n\nWith the backing of the Marcos government and the wealth from the levy fund, Cojuangco was able to completely vertically integrate the coconut trade industry by controlling the financing through UCPB and by buying out Unicom, which was the entity in charge of manufacturing and trading of coconut and coconut by-products. Cojuangco’s wealth increased rapidly, and by the peak of martial law, the value of all the assets he controlled was $1.5 billion, or 25% of the GNP.\n\nCojuangco then used the windfalls from the coconut levy fund and United Coconut Planters Bank to finance his purchase of the enormously profitable San Miguel Corporation. The Marcos government gave favors to San Miguel Corporation (SMC). When taxes for liquor and cigarettes were raised in January 1986, excise taxes on beer decreased. Beer is one of the main products of SMC. The tax cut gave SMC $40 million worth of savings that year.\n\nRoberto Benedicto was Marcos’ former classmate and fraternity brother at the UP Law School. When Marcos was president, Benedicto became part of his small circle in Malacañan, one of the few with full access even to private quarters.\n\nUnder the Marcos administration, he served as Ambassador to Japan and Chief of the Philippine National Bank, which was the largest state-owned bank at the time. He permitted huge loans for business of other cronies and associates. He used PNB to grant loans for his shipping company, Northern Lines, and his sugar business. His election as Japanese Ambassador allowed him to develop high-level contacts in Japan. Working with President Marcos, they ratified the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation between Japan and the Philippines, which gave Japan a “most-favored nation” status.  This agreement gave Japan undue advantage in using the country’s natural resources, which was the primary reason the Philippine Senate did not ratify the treaty for 13 years. Benedicto, understanding the business interests of the Japanese, arranged lucrative joint-venture operations between Japanese corporations and his own. His role as Ambassador also gave him control of the $550 million Japanese war reparations money.\n\nAt the prime of his career, Benedicto’s empire consisted of 85 corporations, 106 sugar farms, 14 haciendas, other agricultural lands, 17 radio stations, 16 television stations, 2 telecommunications networks, 7 buildings, 10 vessels and 5 aircraft. He also owned 14 hectares of real estate in Bacolod City, 13.5 billion shares in Oriental Petroleum, and membership shares in golf and country clubs estimated at $491,000. Overseas, he owned a sugar mill in Venezuela, a trading company in Madrid, bank deposits, mansions, and limousines in California. Marcos’ executive secretary estimated that in 1983, Benedicto’s net worth was $800 million.\n\nLucio Tan styles himself as a rags-to-riches self-made millionaire who worked his way up from sweeping and mopping floors to becoming one of the most influential people in Philippine history. However, a closer inspection at his history will reveal deep connections and cronyism to President Ferdinand Marcos, who was able to launch Tan’s immense wealth through sky-high tariff rates on imported cigarettes, under-the-table tax breaks, and government exemptions, all of which allowed Lucio Tan to have a “virtual monopoly for over 40 years in the Philippine Market”.\n\nFortune Tobacco Corp, founded in 1966 (FTC), is the epicenter of Lucio Tan’s fortune. While it is unclear how much of the market FTC cornered in 1980, estimates range from 60% to 77%. This outright dominance of the cigarette trade in just 14 short years can be attributed to the massive tariffs on imported cigarettes that Tan enjoyed. The nominal rate of protection for cigarettes was at 182% while the Effective Rate of Protection (ERP) was at a colossal rate of 18,758%. This, coupled with the fact that, according to Manapat, during the Martial Law years Lucio Tan regularly evaded taxes, as much as $50 million per year. In addition to this, Fortune Tobacco Corp lawyers were the brains behind the tax laws concerning cigarettes that allowed Tan to completely dominate the cigarette industry.\n\nLucio Tan’s virtual monopoly on cigarettes afforded him all the advantages in the world, to the detriment of the consumers and buyers and therefore, made the cigarette industry a supplier-driven industry.\n\nVelasco was the first chief of the Philippine Ministry of Energy, which was established by Marcos in 1979. The Ministry of Energy sought to remedy the skyrocketing oil and power rates brought by the 1973 global oil crisis, by building power plants from natural energy sources. During his appointment, 20 power plants using hydroelectric, thermal, geothermal energy were completed. A major controversy in his career were the government-imposed levies and taxes on the retail price of gasoline. The gross price of regular gasoline per liter was Php 2.20. After taxes, it totaled to Php5.05, which is more than 50% of the retail cost.\n\nDuring the government’s corruption probe during the Marcos regime, it was found that Velasco’s net worth was estimated to be around $50 million by 1986. He had several million-dollar real estate properties around the world, such as a $1.5 million mansion, a $675,000 condominium both in California, several houses around Metro-Manila, and a reported resort house on the Bataan peninsula only reachable by helicopter or boat. Apart from these properties, Velasco also chaired several government and private corporations, in many petroleum, coal mining, transportation, mineral exploration, and shipping businesses. During the probe, Velasco claimed that he earned his wealth before his appointment under the Marcos administration. However, probers discovered that his net worth was $5.4 million before he joined the government, and it ballooned to $50 million, which is an 825% increase in only 13 years.\n\nCruz served as Undersecretary of Finance from 1968-1970, but he is more well known for his bankrolling Imelda Marcos’ trips abroad using Philippine Air Lines funds, which he also managed. Throughout his chairmanship, the airline was poorly managed and steadily lost venture. This is due to First Lady Imelda Marcos’ indiscriminate international trips, Cruz’s mismanagement, misuse of funds, and his lack of experience. In 1979, PAL lost $33 million, and by 1983, the airline had already lost $63 million. In order to minimize the losses, Cruz asked help from Malacañan. The government increased PAL’s capitalization from $127 million to $380 million, and $63 million from the National Development Corp. was given to PAL. Despite these additions of government money, PAL continued to suffer loses due to Cruz’s mismanagement and lack of experience.\n\nCruz also served as president and general manager of the Government Service and Insurance System (GSIS). GSIS was originally established for financial aid of low-salaried government employees, providing investments, pensions, and housing loans. In 1980, under Cruz’s administration, house loans were phased out. Instead, the GSIS funded Marcos-connected companies and Imelda-inspired projects. Of GSIS’ total budget of $1.3 billion, 65% or $843 million went into Imelda’s lucrative projects, such as luxury hotels made to impress delegates of the IMF-World Bank conference.\n\nCuenca was a college dropout who campaigned and raised funds for Marcos during the 1965 presidential elections and later became Marcos’ close friend and golf partner. He later became the head of Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) which built many of the country’s dams, highways, and bridges, including the San Juanico Bridge, which was a major project that connected Leyte and Samar. CDCP also built many lucrative projects at the behest of the first lady Imelda Marcos, such as a land-reclamation project to create a 240-hectare while beach, a huge complex of native-style pavilions, all to impress foreign delegates of international events and conferences. Government probes have found documents that suggested Marcos received millions of dollars in kickbacks in government construction projects from Cuenca’s company. CDCP experienced remarkable growth and a sudden collapse. This is due to great amounts of foreign loans, dependence on the government, purchases of heavy equipment even when unnecessary, and high debt to equity ratio. In 1978, CDCP accumulated a staggering $158 million debt, which steadily rose to $650 million by 1980.\n\nAccording to Jovito Salonga in his book \"Presidential Plunder\", which details Salonga's time as head of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, these cronies helped the Marcoses amass his wealth by aiding him in one or more of what Salonga called \"Marcos' Techniques of Plunder.\"\n\nThese techniques, Says salonga, were:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9293703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9293703", "title": "Daju people", "text": "Daju people\n\nThe Daju people are a group of seven distinct ethnicities speaking related languages (see Daju languages) living on both sides of the Chad-Sudan border and in the Nuba Mountains. Separated by distance and speaking different languages, at present, they generally have little cultural affinity to each other.\n\nThe traditional area identified with the Daju are the Daju Hills in the southern portion of the Marrah Mountains located in the Darfur province of Sudan. As the Marrah Mountains are the only area in Darfur that has a temperate climate and thus could support large populations, a Daju state arose perhaps as early as the 12th century. Very little is known of this kingdom except for a list of kings and several mentions in Egyptian texts. The Daju appear to be the dominant group in Darfur from earliest times vying for control with their northern Marrah Mountain rivals, the agricultural Fur people.\n\nThe Daju, who known to Henri Barth as \"Pharaoh's Folk\", had migrated originally from the Nile valley in the aftermath of the invasion of Kingdom of Meroe by Izana, king of Axum around the middle of the fourth century A.D. Accounts refer their origins to Shendi, which means in their own language \"ewe.\" First they settled in Wadi al-Malik (Wadi Howar) and Jebel Midob in B.C. 3000 then invaded the Nile valley and Egypt where they ruled under the name of Libyan Pharaohs. An Egyptian Pharaoh expelled them southwards where they established Nepta. Then they have been driven southwards again to Meroe until Izana drove them westwards to Wadi Howar and Kordofan in western Sudan and there they re-established their kingdom around Jebel Qadir in the Nuba Mountains. After several generations, they annexed the land now called Dar Fur and beyond. Historians attribute this later expansion to the war between the Daju kingdom and the Kingdom of Dongola in 1100 AD which led King Ahmed al-Daj to relocate his headquarters to Meri in Jebel Marra massif. Meanwhile, Semia, one of Daju capitals, was completely destroyed by the Amir from Dongola.\n\nThe Daju empire is said to have spread its control as far east as Kurdufan, west of the Nuba Mountains and as far west as Chad. The Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi, writing about 1400, described \"Taju\" as being a fairly powerful kingdom lying between Kanem and the Nile kingdoms. The Daju people are said to have settled in a long belt stretching from South Kurdufan westward through Darfur and into Chad.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Daju dynasty was conquered by the Sokoro-speaking Tunjur people in the 14th century who moved from the west via the kingdoms of Bornu and Wadai. The Daju were scattered with their king escaping westward with some of his people and establishing a small new kingdom in the Dar Sila Area in Chad, becoming the Dar Sila Daju people.\n\nOther Daju moved eastward eventually settling in what is now South Kurdufan province near Muglad just north of Abyei and west of the Nuba Mountains. Records indicate that they consisted of two distinct Daju groups although it is uncertain if this migration displaced pre-existing non-Daju peoples or if one of the Daju groups was already indigenous to the area. There is one source that indicates that both the Ngok Dinka to the South and the Messiria to the North admit that the Daju were the indigenous people of Muglad. They were eventually displaced by the Messiria pushing down from the north and were forced south into Abyei where they were defeated and again dispersed by the Ngok Dinka. One group was driven westward (possibly the ancestors of the Njalgulgule people) and the other group, consisting of Dar Fur Daju, were driven east into the Nuba Hills settling near Lagowa where they developed their own distinct dialect of the Nyala language.\n\nOver time, the Tunjur introduced Islam to the region (which had previously been pagan) and gradually adopted Arabic as their administrative language. In 1596, control of Darfur passed into the hands of the hybrid Keira dynasty through intermarriage between the last sultan of the ruling Tunjur dynasty, Ahmad al-Maqur and its more populous vassals the Fur people. The resulting Fur-dominated Darfur Sultanate continued on until 1898.\n\nAs a result of their defeat at the hands of the Tunjur and then dominance by the Fur, the Daju were displaced from much of their territory and now exist in several distinct pockets in the Sudan and Chad.\n\nThe remaining Daju people exist in the following distinct groups:\n\n\nThere are also two groups located in the Nuba Mountains and due to their sharp linguistic differential from each other as well as the other Daju languages, it is generally agreed that they come from a very early migration (perhaps 2,000 years ago) out of the Daju Urheimat in the Marrah Mountains. There they carved out their own small territory in the midst of the original inhabitants of the eastern Nuba Mountains, the Kordofanian tribes, as well as amongst later migrating tribal/linguistic groupings: the Nyimang tribes, the Temein tribes, and the Kadugli tribes. The migration of the Hill Nubian tribes in the Nuba Hills is generally seen as coming after the main Daju migration. The Nuba Mountains have generally been an area of \"retreat\" for persecuted groups seeking security hence the significant linguistic diversity.\n\n\nThe Daju are primarily grain farmers (mainly millet, sorghum, and corn). Secondarily, they hunt as well as gather (mainly honey, berries and wild fruits). Women perform much of the daily work. They plant and sow the crops, ground the grain, and cook the meals. They are also the primary house-builders. The typical Daju home is round with a cone roof although in the towns, houses are often rectangular. Community chores are shared. Traditionally, Daju women tattoo their eyelids, gums, and lips with acacia thorns.\n\nThe Dar Sila Daju in Chad are arranged by male-led clans. Each clan has its own separate role in society. The Sultan is chosen from one of the clans and his advisors are drawn from other clans. The Sultanship primarily serves the role of religious leader but is also a symbol of tribal identity and unity.\n\nThe Dar Daju Daju and the Dar Sila Daju are predominantly Muslim but they still practice many of their traditional religious customs including the building of straw shrines to their traditional high god Kalge whom they equate with Allah of Islam.\n\nThe Dar Fur Daju maintain their old and original religion.

{"id": "1129167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1129167", "title": "Dental amalgam controversy", "text": "Dental amalgam controversy\n\nThis discussion of the dental amalgam controversy outlines the debate over whether dental amalgam (the mercury alloy in dental fillings) should be used. Supporters claim that it is safe, effective and long-lasting while critics argue that claims have been made since the 1840s that amalgam is unsafe because it may cause mercury poisoning and other toxicity.\n\nSupporters of amalgam fillings point out that it is safe, durable, relatively inexpensive, and easy to use. On average, amalgam lasts twice as long as resin composites, takes less time to place, is tolerant of saliva or blood contamination during placement (unlike composites), and is often about 20-30% less expensive. \"Consumer Reports\" has suggested that many who claim dental amalgam is not safe are \"prospecting for disease\" and using pseudoscience to scare patients into more lucrative treatment options.\n\nThose opposed to amalgam use suggest that modern composites are improving in strength. In addition to their claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account for as much as 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. In the United States, most dental practices are prohibited from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Critics also point to cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.\n\nIt is the position of the FDI World Dental Federation as well as numerous dental associations and dental public health agencies worldwide that amalgam restorations are safe and effective. Numerous other organizations have also publicly declared the safety and effectiveness of amalgam. These include the Mayo clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Canada, Alzheimer's Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Autism Society of America, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New England Journal of Medicine, International Journal of Dentistry, National Council Against Health Fraud, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR, American Cancer Society, Lupus Foundation of America, the American College of Medical Toxicology, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, \"Consumer Reports\" \"Prevention,\" and WebMD.\n\nDental amalgam has had a long history and global impact. It was first introduced in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the fusable metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft metal alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time. In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.\n\nThe Crawcours were a family of five Polish dentists who acquired \"superficial knowledge\" of dentistry in France before moving to England in the 1780s. They advertised extensively, proclaiming their skill, and claimed to be surgeon-dentists to European royalty. In 1833, two members of the Crawcour family invaded the growing United States of America with a cheap coin silver amalgam they called \"royal mineral succedaneum\". The Crawcours set up elegant dental \"parlours\" in New York City and competed with the ethical dentists and catered to the wealthy and influential residents of the city. The patients reclined on comfortable easy chairs and, unlike other dentists, their dentistry was painless since they did not remove any tooth decay, but rather thumbed a soft mixture of their impure amalgam material into cavities. As the Crawcours' business boomed, the conscientious practitioners, who were still working with gold and tin, lost patients. Later, as the brothers' fillings began to fall out, discolor the teeth, and cause tooth fracture because of the cheap amalgam's expansion, the public realized it had been cheated. With that, the brothers returned to Europe in 1834, leaving \"a long trail of victimized patients and exasperated dentists\". However, the damage had been done: amalgam now had a bad reputation, despite the fact that, if used properly, it would later prove to be a safe and effective restorative material.\n\nThe so-called \"Amalgam War\" raged from 1840 to 1855, \"broke up friendships and, even threatened to disrupt the profession.\" In 1841, the American Society of Dental Surgeons, which had been founded the year before as the first national dental society in the United States, appointed a committee to study the amalgam problem. The committee reported that all filling materials in which mercury was an ingredient were, \"hurtful both to the teeth and every part of the mouth, and that there was no tooth in which caries in it could be arrested, and the organ rendered serviceable by being filled, in which gold could not be employed.\" Two years later, without any scientific testing of silver amalgam, their derogatory report resulted in the society's blanket statement that, \"the use of amalgam constitutes malpractice.\" On the other hand, Dr. Christopher S. Brewster of Paris thought that to condemn the use of amalgam in all cases merely because its use was abused by some \"unprincipled quacks\" was unwise. He felt that, \"much good has been and may be done by a judicious use of this composition.\" In 1844, Dr. Parmly, one of the founding members of the American Society of Dental Surgeons, stated that, \"gold is the only substance known that can be permanently relied upon,\" and Dr. Townsend recommended, \"removal of teeth that could not be saved by gold.\" In 1844, the society's members were warned that they were to sign a pledge never to use amalgam or they would risk being expelled from the membership. Many members resigned, and by 1847 only five of New York's 200 dentists remained in the society, which Dr. Charles C. Allen said had \"gold\" for its motto. As more scientific evidence surfaced, the society rescinded the amalgam pledge. However, this came too late, and the organization folded in 1856. At this time, the American Dental Association was formed and it condoned the use of dental amalgam.\n\nIn 1855, Dr. J. Foster Flagg, a professor of dental pathology in Philadelphia, experimented with new mixtures of amalgam. In 1861, he presented his findings to the Pennsylvania Association of Dental Surgeons and, in 1881, he published his book, Plastic and Plastic Fillings (Figure 4). (Amalgam fillings were often called \"plastic fillings\" at the time.) The inevitable result of this affair was that silver amalgam was proven to be, \"an excellent filling material,\" and expanded dentistry's, \"ability to save teeth.\" Around the same time, John and Charles Tomes in England conducted research on the expansion and contraction of the various amalgam products. During the American Civil War, the debate on the merits of amalgam continued. In dental meetings, with now decades of use and dental research came the recognition of the importance of good technique and proper mixture on long-term success. It was argued that, \"the fault was not in the material but in the manipulation...Some men's amalgam is good universally, and some men's gold is bad universally; the difference lies in the preparation of the tooth and in the plug (filling).\"\n\nMore controversy came in 1872, when an amalgam filling was reported as the cause of death of a Nebraska middle-aged man, resulting in a public outcry against the use of amalgam. His physicians reported that the filling caused swelling of his mouth, throat and windpipe, completely hindering respiration. Given that the involved tooth was a lower second molar, it was later considered very likely that the patient died from Ludwig's Angina, which is a type of cellulitis, rather than mercury poisoning. Another alleged case of \"pytalism\" causing headache, fever, rapid pulse, metallic taste, loss of appetite, and generalized malaise was reported in 1872 in a female patient following the insertion of eight amalgam fillings. Later, however, another dentist examined the fillings and noted they had, in a short period of time, washed away, and that upon gentle pressure the metal crumbled away. He removed all the fillings with an explorer in three minutes; and concluded poor workmanship alone could have explained the patient's symptoms.\n\nAlfred Stock was a German chemist who reported becoming very ill in the 1920s and traced his illness to his amalgam fillings and resulting mercury intoxication. He described his recovery after the fillings were removed and believed that amalgam fillings would come to be seen as a, \"sin against humanity.\" Stock had also previously been exposed to toxic levels of mercury vapor during the course of his work, due to his use of liquid mercury in some novel laboratory apparatus he invented.\n\nIn the 1990s, several governments evaluated the effects of dental amalgam and concluded that the most likely health effects would be due to hypersensitivity or allergy. Germany, Austria, and Canada recommended against placing amalgam in certain individuals such as pregnant women, children, those with renal dysfunction, and those with an allergy to metals. In 2004, the Life Sciences Research Office analyzed studies related to dental amalgam published after 1996 and concluded that mean urinary mercury concentration (μg of Hg/L in urine, HgU) was the most reliable estimate of mercury exposure. It found that those with dental amalgam were unlikely to reach the levels where adverse effects are seen from occupational exposure (35 μg HgU). Some 95% of study participants had μg HgU below 4-5. Chewing gum, particularly for nicotine, along with more amalgam, seemed to pose the greatest risk of increasing exposure. One gum-chewer had 24.8 μg HgU. Studies have shown that the amount of mercury released during normal chewing is extremely low. It concluded that there was not enough evidence to support or refute many of the other claims such as increased risk of autoimmune disorders, but stated that the broad and nonspecific illness attributed to dental amalgam is not supported by the data. Mutter in Germany, however, concludes that \"removal of dental amalgam leads to permanent improvement of various chronic complaints in a relevant number of patients in various trials.\"\n\nHal Huggins, a Colorado dentist (previous to having his license revoked), was a notable critic of dental amalgams and other dental therapies he believed to be harmful. His views on amalgam toxicity were featured on \"60 Minutes\" and he was later criticized as a dentist, \"prospecting for disease\" and having only an \"aura of science\" by \"Consumer Reports.\" In 1996, a Colorado state judge recommended that Huggins's dental license be revoked, for tricking chronically ill patients into thinking that the true cause of their illness was mercury. \"Time\" reported the judge's conclusion that Huggins, \"diagnosed 'mercury toxicity' in all his patients, including some without amalgam fillings.\" Huggins's license was subsequently revoked by the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners for gross negligence and the use of unnecessary and unproven procedures.\n\nAccording to the WHO, all humans are exposed to some level of mercury. Factors that determine whether health effects occur and their severity include the type of mercury concerned (methylmercury and ethylmercury, commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact). The universal standard for examining mercury toxicity is usually discussed in terms of the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to creatine for long-term mercury exposure. Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than methylmercury (which is found in fish). The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors.\n\nThe greatest degree of mercury exposure occurs during filling placement and removal. However, this is not the only time mercury vapors are released. When chewing for extended periods of time (more than 30 minutes) an increased level of mercury vapor is released. Vapor levels will return to normal approximately 90 minutes following chewing cessation. This contributes to a daily mercury exposure for those with amalgam filling.\n\nAccording to one dental textbook, eating seafood once a week raises urine mercury levels to 5 to 20 µg/L, which is equivalent to two to eight times the level of exposure that comes from numerous amalgam fillings. Neither exposure has any known health effect. Scientists agree that dental amalgam fillings release elemental mercury vapor, but studies report different amounts. Estimates range from 1-3 micrograms (µg) per day according to the FDA. The effects of that amount of exposure are also disputed.\n\nNewer studies sometimes use mercury vapor analysis instead of the standard exposure test. Because this test was designed for factories and large enclosures, \"Consumer Reports\" has reported that this is not an accurate method of analysis for the mouth. It is less reliable, less consistent, and tends to greatly exaggerate the amount of mercury inhaled. Moreover, it is argued this test additionally exaggerates the amount of mercury inhaled by assuming that all the mercury vapor released is inhaled. This assumption was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and not found to be valid. Their research review found that most of the mercury vapor released from amalgam fillings is mixed with saliva and swallowed, some part is exhaled, and the remaining fraction is inhaled. Of these amounts, it is important to note that the lungs absorb about 80% of inhaled mercury whereas only about 0.01% of swallowed mercury vapour is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nA study conducted by measuring the intraoral vapour levels over a 24-hour period in patients with at least nine amalgam restorations showed that the average daily dose of inhaled mercury vapour was 1.7 μg (range from 0.4 to 4.4 μg), which is approximately 1% of the threshold limit value of 300 to 500 μg/day established by the WHO, based on a maximum allowable environmental level of 50 μg/day in the workplace. Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury body burden; (2) the workplace safety numbers are not applicable to continuous 24-hour exposure, but are limited to a normal work day and a 40-hour workweek; and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst-case patients (those most at risk).\n\nA test that was done throughout the 1980s by some opposition groups and holistic dentists was the skin patch test for mercury allergies. As part of \"prospecting for disease,\" \"Consumer Reports\" wrote that these groups had placed high doses of mercuric chloride on a skin patch which was guaranteed to produce irritation on the patient's skin and subsequent revenue for the person administering the test.\n\nThe current recommendations for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted for) are as follows: The ATSDR Action Level for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1 µg/m and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal Risk Level) for chronic exposure is 0.2 µg/m According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal Risk Level) is an estimate of the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The Action Level is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks. Breathing air with a concentration of 0.2 µg mercury/m would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4 µg/day (respiratory volume of 20m/day). About 80% of inhaled mercury vapor would be absorbed.\n\nA 2003 monograph on mercury toxicity from the WHO concluded that dental amalgam contributes significantly to mercury body burden in humans with amalgam fillings and that dental amalgam is the most common form of exposure to elemental mercury in the general population, constituting a potentially significant source of exposure to elemental mercury. Estimates of daily intake from amalgam restorations range from 1 to 12.5 μg/day, with the majority of dental amalgam holders being exposed to less than 5 μg mercury/day. They also note that this will continue to decline as the number of amalgam restorations is declining.\n\nAs public pressure demands more research on amalgam safety, an increasing number of studies with larger sample sizes are being conducted. Those who are not opposed to amalgam claim that, aside from rare and localized tissue irritation, recent evidence-based research has continued to demonstrate no ill effects from the minute amounts of mercury exposure from amalgam fillings. A 2004 systematic review conducted by the Life Sciences Research Office, whose clients include the FDA and NIH, concluded that, \"the current data are insufficient to support an association between mercury release from dental amalgam and the various complaints that have been attributed to this restoration material.\" A systematic review in 2009 demonstrated that mercury released from amalgam restorations does not give rise to toxic effects on the nervous system of children. More recently, a Cochrane Systematic review in 2014 found, \"insufficient evidence to support or refute any adverse effects associated with amalgam or composite restorations.\"\n\nThose opposed to dental amalgam suggest that mercury from dental amalgam may lead to nephrotoxicity, neurobehavioural changes, autoimmunity, oxidative stress, autism, skin and mucosa alterations, non-specific symptoms and complaints, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.\n\nBoth those opposed and those not opposed to dental amalgam recognize that amalgam has been found to be a rare contributor to localized and temporary tissue irritation known as oral lichenoid lesions. These mild, lichenoid reactions have also been reported in composite resin fillings. Those opposed to amalgam believe that amalgam fillings are also associated with increased risk of other autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis, lupus, thyroiditis, and eczema.\n\n\"Consumer Reports\" considered these alleged associations between amalgam and chronic disease made by some health practitioners as \"prospecting for diseases\". The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA) similarly has stated, \"There is no scientific evidence to connect the development or worsening of MS with dental fillings containing mercury, and therefore no reason to have those fillings removed. Although poisoning with heavy metals-such as mercury, lead, or manganese can damage the nervous system and produce symptoms such as tremor and weakness, the damage is inflicted in a different way than occurs in MS and the process is also different.\" The Lupus Foundation of America also states on their website, \"At the present time, we do not have any scientific data that indicates that dental fillings may act as a trigger of lupus. In fact, it is highly unlikely that dental fillings aggravate or cause SLE.\"\n\nIn 2006, a literature review was undertaken to evaluate the research on amalgam and its potential health effects on dentists and dental staff. It was reported that there is currently no conclusive epidemiological evidence regarding risks for adverse reproductive outcomes associated with mercury and dental professionals. It is mentioned that evidence to date fails to account for all confounding variables (such as alcohol consumption) and recommends more comprehensive and rigorous studies to adequately assess the hazards faced by dental personnel.\n\nThe American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology say that research confirms that mercury from amalgams does not cause illness because the amount of mercury that they release is not enough to cause a health problem. In response to some people wanting their existing amalgam removed for fear of mercury poisoning, these societies advise that the removal of fillings is likely to cause a greater exposure to mercury than leaving the fillings in place. These societies warn that removal of amalgam fillings, in addition to being unnecessary health care and likely to cause more mercury exposure than leaving them in place, is also expensive.\n\nFar more mercury is released when amalgam fillings are removed than over their entire lifetime if left undisturbed. This led to some dentists who advocate removal of amalgam fillings (who may describe themselves as \"holistic dentists\") to develop special techniques to counter this, such as wearing breathing apparatus, using high-volume aspiration, and performing the procedure as quickly as possible. The impact of such techniques on the dose of mercury received during filling removal is unknown, and the techniques have been criticized as merely advertising gimmicks which enable such dentists to charge far more than a normal dentist would for the same procedure. Sources of mercury from the diet, and the potential harm of the composite resins (which mimic female sex hormones) to replace the purportedly harmful amalgam fillings, are also ignored by these dentists.\n\n\"Consumer Reports\" has warned its readers on several occasions that, \"if a dentist wants to remove your fillings because they contain mercury, watch your wallet.\"\n\nAlternative materials which may be suitable in some situations include composite resins, glass ionomer cements, porcelain and gold alloys.\nMost of these materials, with the notable exception of gold, have not been used as long as amalgam, and some are known to contain other potentially hazardous compounds. Teaching of amalgam techniques to dental students is declining in some schools in favor of composite resin, and at least one school, University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, eliminated dental amalgam from the curriculum entirely in 2001. This is largely a response to consumer pressure for white fillings for cosmetic reasons, and also because of the increasing longevity of modern resin composites. These alternative dental restorative materials are not free of potential health risks, such as allergenicity, inhalation of resin dust, cytotoxicity, and retinal damage from blue curing light.\n\nAnti-amalgam sources typically promote removal of amalgam fillings and substitution with other materials. Detoxification may also be advised, including fasting, restricted dieting to avoid mercury containing foods, and quasi-chelation therapies, allegedly to remove accumulated mercury from the body. The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology recommend against chelation therapy and say that chelation therapy can artificially and temporarily elevate the levels of heavy metals in the urine (a practice referred to as \"provoked\" urine testing). They also mention that the chelating drugs may have significant side effects, including dehydration, hypocalcemia, kidney injury, liver enzyme elevations, hypotension, allergic reactions, and mineral deficiencies.\n\nBetter dental health overall coupled with increased demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, have resulted in a steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for many years to come. Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.\n\nThere is little evidence to suggest that amalgam fillings have any negative direct effects on pregnancy outcomes or on an infant post-pregnancy. A study, consisting of 72 pregnant women, was conducted to determine the effects of dental amalgam on babies in utero. Results indicated that although the amount of amalgam the mother had was directly related to the amount of mercury in the amniotic fluid, no negative effects on the fetus were found. A larger study, consisting of 5,585 women who had recently given birth, was used to determine if amalgam restorations during pregnancy had any effects on infant birthweight. Among the study group, 1,117 women had infants with low birth weights and 4,468 women had infants with normal birth weights. Approximately five percent of the women had one or more amalgam filling restorations during their pregnancy term. These women had little to no difference in infant birth weight compared to the women whom did not undergo amalgam restoration during pregnancy.\n\nA 2006 Zogby International poll of 2,590 US adults found that 72% of respondents were not aware that mercury was a main component of dental amalgam and 92% of respondents would prefer to be told about mercury in dental amalgam before receiving it as a filling. A 1993 study published in FDA Consumer found that 50% of Americans believed fillings containing mercury caused health problems. Some dentists (including a member of the FDA's Dental Products Panel) suggest that there is an obligation to inform patients that amalgam contains mercury.\n\nA prominent debate occurred in the late 20th century, with consumer and regulatory pressure to eliminate amalgam, \"at an all-time high\". In a 2006 nationwide poll, 76% of Americans were unaware that mercury is the primary component in amalgam fillings, and this lack of informed consent was the most consistent issue raised in a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel on the issue by panel members.\n\nThe broad lack of knowledge that existed among the public was also displayed when a December 1990 episode of the CBS news program \"60 Minutes\" covered mercury in amalgam. This resulted in a nationwide amalgam scare and additional research into mercury release from amalgam. The following month \"Consumer Reports\" published an article criticizing the content of the broadcast, stating that it contained a great deal of false information and that the ADA spokesperson on the program was ill-prepared to defend the claims. For example, 60 Minutes reported that Germany was planning to pass legislation within the year to ban amalgam, but the institute of German Dentists said one month later that there was no such law pending. Also, one physiologist interviewed by \"Consumer Reports\" noted that the testimonials are mostly anecdotal, and both the reported symptoms and the rapid recovery time after the fillings are removed are physiologically inconsistent with that of mercury poisoning. \"Consumer Reports\" goes on to criticize how 60 Minutes failed to interview the many patients who had fillings or teeth removed only to have the symptoms stay the same or get worse.\n\nIn 1991, the United States Food and Drug Administration concluded that, \"none of the data presented show a direct hazard to humans from dental amalgams.\" In 2002, a class action lawsuit was initiated by patients who felt their amalgam fillings caused them harm. The lawsuit named the ADA, the New York Dental Association, and the Fifth District Dental Society for deceiving, \"[the] public about health risks allegedly associated with dental amalgam.\" On February 18, 2003, the New York Supreme Court dismissed the two amalgam-related lawsuits against organized dentistry, stating the plaintiffs had, \"failed to show a 'cognizable cause of action'.\"\n\nThe proper interpretation of the data is considered controversial only by those opposed to amalgam. The vast majority of past studies have concluded that amalgams are safe. However, although the vast majority of patients with amalgam fillings are exposed to levels too low to pose a risk to health, many patients (i.e. those in the upper 99.9 percentile) exhibit urine test results which are comparable to the maximum allowable legal limits for long-term work place (occupational) safety. Two recent randomized clinical trials in children discovered no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over a five-year period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. In contrast, one study showed a trend of higher dental treatment need later in children with composite dental fillings, and thus claimed that amalgam fillings are more durable. However, the other study (published in JAMA) cites increased mercury blood levels in children with amalgam fillings. The study states, \"during follow-up [blood mercury levels were] 1.0 to 1.5 μg higher in the amalgam group than in the composite group.\" EPA considers high blood mercury levels to be harmful to the fetus and also states that, \"exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages.\" Currently, EPA has set the \"safe\" mercury exposure level to be at 5.8 μg of mercury per one liter of blood. While mercury fillings themselves do not increase mercury levels above \"safe\" levels, they have been shown to contribute to such increase. However, such studies were unable to find any negative neurobehavioral effects.\n\nEnvironmental concerns over external costs exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam is the largest source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by land application, landfilling or incineration. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, have required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.\n\nThe WHO reported in 2005 that in the United Kingdom mercury from amalgam accounted for 5% of total mercury emissions. In Canada, dental amalgam was estimated to contribute one-third of the mercury in sewer system waste, but it is believed amalgam separators in dental offices may dramatically decrease this burden on the public sewer system.\n\nThe 2005 WHO report stated that mercury from amalgam was approximately 1% of total global mercury emissions, and that one-third of the total mercury in most sewage systems was discharged from dental offices. Other studies have shown this to be a gross exaggeration or not reflective of developed countries. With respect to pollution in the United States, a study done in 1992 showed that batteries \"accounted for 86 percent of discarded mercury and dental amalgam a mere 0.56 percent\". Mercury is an environmental contaminant and the WHO, OSHA, and NIOSH have established specific occupational exposure limits. Mercury imposes health risks upon the surrounding population. In economics, this pollution is considered an external cost not factored into the private costs of using mercury-based products. Environmental risks from amalgam can be mitigated by amalgam separators and the ISO has issued standards regarding the proper handling and disposal of amalgam waste. It should be noted, however, that mercury is a naturally occurring element that is present throughout the environment and the vast majority of the pollution (about 99%) comes from large-scale human industrial activity (such as coal-fired electricity generation, hydroelectric dams, and mining, which increase both airborne and waterborne mercury levels). Eventually, the airborne mercury finds its way into lakes, rivers, and oceans, where it is consumed by aquatic life. Amalgam separators may dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system, but they are not mandatory in some jurisdictions. When mercury from these sources enters bodies of water, especially acidic bodies of water, it can be converted into the more toxic methylmercury.\n\nCremation of bodies containing amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury into the atmosphere, as the temperature in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the UK), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam-containing teeth prior to cremation to installing activated carbon adsorption or other post-combustion mercury capture technology in the flue gas stream. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, it is estimated that globally about 3.6 tonnes of mercury vapor was emitted into the air through cremation in 2010, or about 1% of total global emissions. Mercury emissions from cremation are growing in the US, both because cremation rates are increasing and because the number of teeth in the deceased are increasing due to better dental care. Since amalgam restorations are very durable and relatively inexpensive, many of the older deceased have amalgam restorations. According to work done in Great Britain, mercury emissions from cremation are expected to increase until at least 2020.\n\nThe American Dental Association (ADA) has asserted that dental amalgam is safe and has held that, \"the removal of amalgam restorations from the non-allergic patient for the alleged purpose of removing toxic substances from the body, when such treatment is performed solely at the recommendation or suggestion of the dentist, is improper and unethical\". Under the comments of the American Dental Association before the FDA's Dental Products Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, the ADA supports the 2009 FDA ruling on dental amalgam. ADA states that \"dental amalgam has an established record of safety and effectiveness, which the scientific community has extensively reviewed and affirmed.\" The ADA also supports the 2017 EPA wastewater regulation and is providing information and assistance to its members in implementation of amalgam separators. The ADA asserts the best scientific evidence supports the safety of dental amalgam. Clinical studies have not established an occasional connection between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in the general population.\n\nIn 2002, Dr. Maths Berlin of The Dental Material Commission published an overview and assessment of the scientific literature published between November 1997 – 2002 for the Swedish Government on amalgam and its possible environmental and health risks. A final report was submitted to the Swedish Government in 2003 and included his report as an annex to the full report. In the final report from 2003, Berlin states that the 1997 summary had found that \"... no known epidemiological population study has demonstrated any adverse health effects in amalgam\". \nHe reports that researchers have been able to show effects of mercury at lower concentrations than before and states that \"...the safety margin that it was thought existed with respect to mercury exposure from amalgam has been erased.\" He recommends eliminating amalgam in dentistry for medical and environmental reasons as soon as possible.\n\nAfter FDA's deliberations and review of hundreds of scientific studies relating to the safety of dental amalgam, the FDA concluded that \"clinical studies have not established a causal link between dental amalgam and adverse health effects in adults and children age six and older.\" The FDA concluded that individuals age six and older are not at risk of mercury-associated health effects from mercury vapor exposure that come from dental amalgam.\n\nIn 2009, the FDA issued a final rule which classified dental amalgam as a \"Class II\" (moderate risk) device, placing it in the same category as composite resins and gold fillings. In a press release announcing the reclassification, the agency again stated that \"the levels [of mercury] released by dental amalgam fillings are not high enough to cause harm in patients.\"\n\nAlso, in the FDA final regulation on dental amalgam in 2009, the FDA recommended the product labeling of dental amalgam. The suggested labeling included: a warning against the use of dental amalgam in patients with mercury allergy, a warning that dental professionals use appropriate ventilation when handling dental amalgam, and a statement discussion of scientific evidence on dental amalgam's risks and benefits in order to make informed decisions amongst patient and professional dentists.\n\nThe use of mercury in dental fillings is considered safe and effective in all countries practicing modern dentistry (see below). There are currently two countries, Norway and Sweden, that have introduced legislation to prohibit or restrict use of amalgam fillings; however, in both cases amalgam is part of a larger program of reducing mercury in the environment and includes the banning of mercury-based batteries, thermometers, light bulbs, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc. In many countries, unused dental amalgam after a treatment is subject to disposal protocols for environmental reasons. Over 100 countries are signatories to the United Nations \"Minamata Convention on Mercury\". Unlike mercury-based batteries, cosmetics, and medical devices (which will be banned by the year 2020), the treaty has not banned the use of dental amalgam, but allows phasing down amalgam use over a time period appropriate to domestic needs, an approach advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nFDI World Dental Federation recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. FDI is a federation of approximately 200 national dental associations and dental specialist groups representing over 1.5 million dentists. In collaboration with the WHO, they have produced an FDI position statement and WHO consensus statement on dental amalgam. Their position regarding the safety of dental amalgam is that, aside from rare allergic reactions and local side effects, \"the small amount of mercury released from amalgam restorations, especially during placement and removal, has not been shown to cause any other adverse health effects.\" The paper goes on to say that there have been \"no controlled studies published that show adverse systemic effects\" from amalgam restorations and there is no evidence that removing amalgam restorations relieves any general symptoms. More recently, FDI has published a resolution confirming that their position on the safety and effectiveness of amalgam has not changed despite the phasing-down in some countries\n\nIn the United States, numerous respected professional and non-profit organizations consider amalgam use to be safe and effective and have publicly declared such. In addition to the American Dental Association, other American organizations, including the Mayo clinic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Alzheimer's Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, Autism Society of America, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, New England Journal of Medicine, International Journal of Dentistry, National Council Against Health Fraud, The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research NIDCR, American Cancer Society, Lupus Foundation of America, \"Consumer Reports\" and WebMD have all given formal, public statements declaring that amalgam fillings are safe based on the best scientific evidence.\n\nOn July 28, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recategorized amalgam as a class II medical device, which critics claim indicates a change in their perception of safety. The ADA has indicated that this new regulation actually places encapsulated amalgam in the same class of devices as most other restorative materials, including composite and gold fillings.\n\nDespite the research regarding the safety of amalgam fillings, the state of California requires warning information given to patients for legal reasons (informed consent) as part of California's controversial and voter-driven Proposition 65. This warning also applied to resin fillings for a time, since they contain Bis-phenol A (BPA) a chemical known to cause reproductive toxicity at high doses.\n\nIn Canada, amalgam use is considered safe and effective. A 2005 position statement from the Canadian Dental Association (CDA) states that \"current scientific evidence on the use of dental amalgam supports that amalgam is an effective and safe filling material that provides a long-lasting solution for a broad range of clinical situations. The CDA has established its position based on the current consensus of scientific and clinical experts and on recent extensive reviews of strong evidence by major North American and international organizations, which have satisfactorily countered any safety concerns.\" Amalgam use is regulated by Health Canada as are all medical treatments and Health Canada has also stated that dental amalgam is not causing illness in the general population. Not all organizations in Canada share this view. In a recent publication, the Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors states that \"... mercury is the most toxic non-radioactive material on earth, and since it is constantly being released from amalgam, its use should be abandoned. They recommend a gradual detox and chelation therapy over several months to minimize the toxic effects of amalgam fillings.\n\nAustralia recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. In 2012, the Australian Dental Association published a position paper on the safety of dental amalgam. Their position is that \"Dental Amalgam has been used as a dental restorative material for more than 150 years. It has proved to be a durable, safe and effective material which has been the subject of extensive research over this time\" and that \"amalgam should continue to be available as a dental restorative material\".\n\nScientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) is a scientific committee within the European Commission. In a 2008 document of 74 pages, its research on the subject of amalgam safety concluded that \"there is no scientific evidence for risks of adverse systemic effects exist [\"sic\"] and the current use of dental amalgam does not pose a risk of systemic disease.\"\n\nEngland and Scotland recognize the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A policy statement from the British Dental Health Foundation states that they do not consider amalgams containing mercury a significant health risk.\n\nIreland recognizes the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. The Irish Dental Association has published on their website: \"Dental amalgam has been used on patients for over 150 years. All available world-wide research indicates that amalgam is not harmful to health... No Government or reputable scientific, medical or dental body anywhere in the world accepts, on any published evidence, that dental amalgam is a hazard to health.\" The Irish Dental Association provides additional detail in a published patient information letter.\n\nFrance has publicly recognized the safety and effectiveness of amalgam restorations. A position paper on the Association Dentaire Française website states that amalgam restorations have proven to have no biological or toxic effect. They also mention that no serious pathological fact has ever been observed and no general toxic action has been scientifically proven to date. The most exposed subjects remain dentists in whom it did not identify occupational diseases related to mercury and other rare that any allergies. These amalgam allergies are about 40 times less than that of resin fillings\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s in Norway, there was considerable and intense public debate on the use of dental amalgam. The Norwegian Dental Patients Association (Forbundet Tenner og Helse), made up of people who believe they suffered health effects from amalgam fillings, was a driving force in this debate. During this time, the media often featured interviews with people claiming that their health problems were caused by amalgam fillings, and who have regained their health after replacing their amalgam fillings with a different material. Some scientific studies also reported that patients have been restored to health after having had their amalgam fillings replaced. However, these studies were heavily disputed at the time and the Norwegian Board of Health still maintain there is no scientifically proven connection between dental amalgam and health problems.\n\nIn 1991, organized through the ministry of the environment, Norway began phasing out the use of most mercury-containing products (not limited to amalgam fillings but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, etc.). The ban on the import, export, and use of most mercury-based products began on 1 January 2008. The Norwegian officials stressed that this is not a decision based on using an unsafe health product, but rather that the \"overall, long term goal is to eliminate the use and release of mercury to the environment\". Despite the mercury ban, dental offices in Norway may apply for exemptions to use amalgam on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSimilar to Norway, from 1995 to 2009 the Environment Ministry of the Government of Sweden gradually banned the import and use of all mercury-based products (not limited to amalgam fillings alone, but also including mercury-based batteries, thermometers, sphygmomanometers, consumer electronics, vehicle components, lightbulbs, analytical chemicals, cosmetics, etc.). These mercury-based products were phased out for environmental reasons and precautionary health reasons. Like Norway, there was considerable public pressure in the years leading up to the ban. Since the ban, the Government of Sweden continued to investigate ways of reducing mercury pollution. The Swedish Chemicals Agency state that they may grant exemptions on the use of amalgam on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFollowing the Minimata Convention on Mercury, from July 2018 onwards, the EU Mercury Regulation prohibits the use of dental amalgam in children under 15 years old and pregnant or breastfeeding woman. Additional requirements include the use of pre-encapsulated mercury and ethical disposal of waste amalgam. The British Dental Association (BDA) has worked with the Council of European Dentists (CED) to prevent an immediate ban of amalgam until further research into practicalities has been undertaken. The European Commission will report to European Parliament by June 2020, and to the European Council by 2030 regarding the viability of ending dental amalgam use by 2030.\n\n\n"}

His real \nname was Qaboolo (or Qabool Muhammad ) He belongs to Baloch Tribe Lashari. He rose to become Madarul-Muham (Prime Minister) and was titled as Mubarak Khan Lashari.\n\nIn the days of Mongol, Sultan Hussain Mirza Baiqra, of Khurasan, on complaints of the merchants of Central Asia (Herat and Qandhar), that they were looted by Sir.dhis, the Sultan sent armed \nexpedition to Sind border, which after initial raids returned to their country. A declaration of victory was issued in Herat in 892 A.H. (1487 A.D.). It states that the infidels (Sindhis) having come to know of Mongol movements,collected a large army and wanted to make a surprise attack but the Islamic forces (Mongols) came to know of it and made offensive attacks, killing many of these Hindus (forces of Jam Nizamuddin). As a result of this success declaration of victory was issued.\n\nThis may have been an attack on Sindh border without any results. Amir Zul Noon Arghoon, then was Herat's Naib at Qandhar. He seems to have despatched his son Shah Beg on this expedition.The latter captured the Sibi Fort from Jam Nizamuddin's agent Bahadur Khan and installed his brother Sultan Mohammad, who later on was defeated ard killed by Mubarak Khan Lashari (Darya Khan Lashari Dullah) near Jalwagir in Bolan Pass, close to Bibi Nani.\n\nAfter this incident the Mongols did not turn up in Sindh during the life of Jam Nizamuddin.

At that time Jam Feroz had neglected the affairs of the state, refused the advice of Darya Khan Lashari, who had to retire to his Jagir in the village Ghaha (Kahan near Sehwan and these failures brought his defeat at the hands of Salahuduin who \nthus became the ruler of Sind. Feroz Shah along with his mother Madina Machhani went over to Ghaha to Darya Khan Lashari, who at the request of Madina agreed to help, collected troops from Sehwan, but got the first set-back at the hands of Haji, the Minister of Jam Salahuddin. As luck would have it the Minister's letter about the success of the initial battle addressed to Jam Salahuddin fell in the hands of Darya Khan Lashari, who had it replaced, conveying Salahuddin that the Minister's forces had been defeated and it was advisable for him to abandon Thatta. This was quickly done. Darya Khan Lashari then moved Feroz Shah to Thatta and installed him on 1st Shawwal, 918 A.H. (1512 A D. 12 October). Salahuddin then returned to Gujarat. He had remained in possession of Thatta for about eight months and must have collected a large sum of money from Thatta and organized another battle.\n\nThere are different versions about the last days of his life.\n\nTahiri states:<br> \n\n<br>Masumi on the other hand reports:\nBeglar Nama states that:\n\nZafar-ul-Walih states:\n<br>\n\nAn inscription at the north oi Mubarak Khan's grave calls him Al Khanul Azam Wa Shahid Mubarak Khan Ibn Sultan Nizamuddin.\n"}

Filipinos have been settling in Cuba since the 16th century and they are one of the earliest Asian communities in the country.\n\nFilipinos and other Asian workers reached Cuba by sailing in the Manila-Acapulco galleons that crossed the Pacific Ocean regularly from the late 16th century until 1815. Manila was the jump-off point for all Spanish trade coming from East Asia, while Havana was the take-off point for Spanish trading ships sailing from Latin America to Spain. Most of the Asians who landed in Cuba went on to work in \"Nueva Filipinas\" (New Philippines) which is now Pinar del Río.\n\nMost Filipinos who were brought by the Spaniards to Cuba worked in the tobacco plantations while there were others who were altar boys, catechism leaders, and church workers. Pinar del Río is famous for their cigars, which were brought over from the Philippines by the Spanish because it was much closer to Europe and easier to oversee. Afterwards, some Filipinos moved to Havana's big Barrio Chino or Chinatown. Others jumped ship to Louisiana. Others also sailed back to Sinaloa and Jalisco in Mexico. Those with money went to Spain or back to Manila (and brought with them the \"Escabeche a la Cubana\" which is a favorite dish to all Filipinos which they almost always serve using fish). The rest intermarried with the Cuban population.\n\nOver time, the Filipinos who stayed quickly lost their ties to the Philippines since many among the Filipinos were like the local Cubans. They can speak Spanish, they were Catholic, they have to pay taxes or tributos, and they were treated like slaves by their Spanish masters. Nonetheless, their children survive to this day. Filipino Cubans were generally called “Chinos Manila,\" as Manila was very famous among the Cuban population at that time.\n\nImportant Filipino Cubans include the Azcarraga Fessner family, whose patriarch was Marcelo de Azcarraga y Palmero, the first Prime Minister of Spain to be of Filipino descent, whose mother was a Filipina from the Lizarrabal and Palmero families.\n\n"}

American cities have promoted such events to bring people to historic areas perceived as dangerous, using the \"safety in numbers\" mentality to combat urban decay. In some cities this monthly event may occur on the first Saturday of each month instead of Friday or on \"Third Thursdays\".\n\nAdditionally, these are \"see and be seen\" events that serve as a block party or social gathering open to the general public. Some of these events may be centered on political networking by Republicans and Democrats, but usually First Fridays are art and entertainment destinations. They may involve pub crawling, other retail establishments such as cafes and restaurants, and performances by fire twirling acts, jazz musicians, belly dancing, street musicians, or others.\n\n\"First Fridays\" is also a nationally recognized networking event targeting African American professionals held on the first Friday of every month in various cities throughout North America. These events started in 1987 and provide urban professionals an opportunity to socially network, exchange and share ideas on professional, educational, political and social issues.\n\nSome cities hold \"gallery hops\" and \"art walks\", in which a number of the town's art galleries, museums, or artists' studios, both commercial and non-profit 501c3 organizations, will open their doors on Friday evening. The idea is that galleries will attract people to the downtown and enrich the art community by pooling their openings together, sometimes, as in the case of art6 and Artspace in Richmond, Virginia (when in Jackson Ward at 6 East Broad Street) into one monthly evening in a historically-located designated arts district .\n\nAmong the cities with art-oriented First Friday events are: Albany, Anchorage, Augusta, Bellingham, Binghamton, Boston, Burlington, Chicago, Columbus, Denver, Fort Collins Honolulu, Indianapolis, Ithaca, Juneau, Kalamazoo, Kansas City, Knoxville, Lincoln, Louisville, Las Vegas, Miami, Missoula, Peoria (Illinois), Scranton, Oakland, Olympia, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond, Rochester, San Antonio, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, Spokane, Tallahassee, Tulsa, York (PA), and Ypsilanti.\n\nRichmond, Virginia is among the largest First Fridays art walks in the nation. It draws nearly 20,000 people from all over the state of Virginia and nation, showcasing its artistic side and opening restaurants and art galleries all over Broad Street, Manchester area, and Downtown Richmond. Artspace and Art6 Gallery were two of the first anchor galleries for First Fridays on Broad Street in Richmond.\n\nOne of the oldest First Friday's is located in Boston's SoWa Arts District where more than 80 artists open their studios to the public every First Friday. The SoWa Arts District is located at Harrison Ave and Thayer Street in Boston's South End. In 2015, USA Today's 10BEST readers poll voted the SoWa as the second best arts district in the country.\n\nSome First Fridays promote arts and culture combined with social networking, like First Fridays in Tucson, AZ. Other smaller-scale First Fridays serve as social gatherings for groups of friends or people new to an area and may involve no art.\n\nThey may also include the large First Friday events such as those in Phoenix, Arizona attracting up to 20,000 attendees to hundreds of spaces.\n\nVarious cities areas have First Fridays centered on politically conservative networking. The pioneer of these events began in Washington, D.C. but similar events have found success in Virginia, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\nIn many cities, First Fridays events place an emphasis on African American networking and business opportunities for African American professionals. First Friday is the top networking event for African American professionals and consistently attracts over 16,000 people each month across North America according to First Fridays United.\n\nThe First Fridays monthly events originated in 1987 as an outlet for African American professionals to mix, mingle and network. During the 1980s it was common for an individual to be the only black professional working in their company. First Fridays happy hours become a way for these professionals to meet in a social atmosphere while exchanging useful information. The concept spread rapidly and First Fridays chapters now operate in 39 cities across North America and seven countries worldwide, including Austin, Binghamton, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Charleston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Fort Myers, Fort Lauderdale, Hattiesburg, Hartford, Hong Kong, Houston, Indianapolis, Jackson, Kansas City, Kingston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Long Beach London, Louisville, Memphis, Miami, Nashville, Nassau, New Orleans, New York, Newark, Oakland, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, Richmond, Rio de Janeiro, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, St. Louis, Normandy, Scranton, South Bend, Syracuse, Tallahassee, Tokyo, Toronto, and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2002, several First Fridays operators created First Fridays United, which is a company founded to organize the existing First Fridays chapters in 30 cities into one group to share information, resources and solicit corporate sponsors and advertisers. The organization sponsors a series of international events in addition to the monthly networking happy hours. Today, First Fridays reaches over 450,000 urban professionals through email, internet, and event marketing and has had numerous Fortune 1000 corporate clients.\n\n"}
{"id": "2602057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2602057", "title": "Freemasonry in Malta", "text": "Freemasonry in Malta\n\nFreemasonry in Malta has a lengthy history dating from the eighteenth century. The main masonic influences (and external supervision) have been from the United Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland. Today Regular Freemasonry is under the jurisdiction of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta, formed in 2004. \n\nAnother self-styled, irregular masonic body going by the name ‘Grand Lodge of Malta’ exists (whose members broke away from the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2009).\n\nThe Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta is recognized internationally by a majority of the Regular masonic jurisdictions worldwide, whilst the Grand Lodge of Malta is recognized by only two jurisdictions worldwide, one of which is the Grand Orient de France, an irregular Grand Lodge that unlike Regular Freemasonry throughout the world, admits women as masons within its ranks.\n\nFreemasonry in Malta began in 1730 when \"Parfait Harmonie\", the first warranted lodge, was formed under the Marseilles (France) masonic jurisdiction. By 1741, freemasonry was established firmly in Malta.\n\nMany knights of the Order of St. John, and some of the Maltese nobility, were freemasons. Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca was a freemason, and others (including Grand Master De Rohan) are reported also to have been freemasons, and influential in the spread of freemasonry in Malta. The first Masonic lodges operated in Malta under French warrants generally obtained from Marseilles, but under the guidance of Count von Kollowrat, the Scottish Lodge of St. John of Marseilles petitioned the Grand Lodge of the Moderns in England to obtain an English warrant on 30 June 1788. This lodge noted in its petition that the most important members of the Order of St. John ranked amongst its membership. The lodge obtained an English warrant as the Lodge of St. John of Secrecy and Harmony. This lodge ceased to function sometime before 1813.\n\nAfter the 1798–1800 French occupation of Malta, many French soldiers were incarcerated as prisoners of war. In 1811, they established a Masonic lodge named \"Les Amis en Captivite\" under a warrant from Marseilles. In that same year, the lodge was attacked by rioters, following exhortations from priests that the freemasons were responsible for the prevailing drought and disease stricken horses.\n\nFollowing repatriation of the bulk of prisoners between April and August 1814, the lodge members were essentially non-French. On 6 October 1819, the lodge obtained a warrant from United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). The lodge was permitted to work in Italian. In 1820, the British Governor on the island, Thomas Maitland, suspended the lodge by reason of infiltration by the \"carbonari\", an Italian secret society which purported to subvert Italian states. It nevertheless appears on the official list of UGLE up to 1824.\n\nAlthough some evidence has been presented to suggest that Napoleon Bonaparte was a Freemason, including a masonic apron said to have been his, and annotated with his name and masonic dates, now owned by Columbia Lodge No 2397 (London), there remains considerable uncertainty over the question. Several French sources cite similar accounts of his initiation into freemasonry in Malta in 1798 in a French Regimental Lodge, probably Army Philadelphe Lodge, but the earliest of these sources dates to some years after the events described, and there is no extant primary source, such as a Lodge minute book or attendance register. A number of masonic scholars have explored the available evidence, but none has felt able to form a definite opinion for or against the evidence.\n\nMalta came under effective British control in 1800, and was formally part of the British Empire from 1814 until 1964. During this time organised Freemasonry developed in Malta.\n\nEarly in 1815, a petition for the creation of the Lodge of St. John and St. Paul was submitted to the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). The lodge’s warrant was signed by the Grand Master, the Duke of Sussex, on 27 November 1815. This lodge is the oldest English lodge that still meets on the island. From 1822 John Hookham Frere was a member of the Lodge, becoming its treasurer in 1823. He remained part of the organization until 1843.\n\nBy 1890 there were five lodges under English (UGLE) jurisdiction, with a total of 409 masons. All of the English lodges in Malta were organised into a District Grand Lodge in 1849, and thereafter had a local District Grand Master and District officers. By 1900 the number of lodges had increased to seven, with a total of 584 members; by 1919 there were 1,484 freemasons in Malta under the UGLE constitution.\n\nDuring the same period of British rule there were three other regular lodges consecrated in Malta, two by the Grand Lodge of Ireland, and one by the Grand Lodge of Scotland.\n\nOn 21 September 1964, Malta gained independence. Following the withdrawal of British forces from the island, and the shutdown of the British naval base on 31 March 1979, a significant proportion of the active members returned to the United Kingdom. As a result, all but two of the English lodges were relocated to England; of the two lodges remaining in Malta, one was unable to survive and surrendered its warrant, leaving the Lodge of St. John and St. Paul No 349 (the oldest of the English lodges in Malta) still meeting on the island. In 1984, the English District Grand Lodge of Malta, having been relocated to England, was dissolved. Following the dissolution, UGLE appointed a Grand Inspector, a senior officer of the Grand Lodge with responsibility for supervising English Freemasonry in Malta. A further two English lodges were subsequently consecrated, taking the total to three.\n\nAt the formation of the new Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, each local lodge had to decide to remain under its home jurisdiction or join the new Maltese constitution. One of the three UGLE lodges became a founding lodge of the new Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta, leaving two (Lodge of St John & St Paul No 349, and De Rohan Installed Masters Lodge No 9670) still under English jurisdiction.\n\nDuring the colonial period, there were two Lodges warranted in Malta by the Grand Lodge of Ireland: the Leinster Lodge No 387 founded in 1851, and the Abercorn Lodge No 273 founded in 1899. Later, following independence, the Grand Lodge of Ireland warranted two further lodges: the Fenici Lodge No 906 in 1991, and Hospitalliers Lodge No 931 in 2004.\n\nOn the formation of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, all of these Irish lodges became founding members of the new Grand Lodge. As a result there is no extant Irish Freemasonry in Malta today.\n\nThere is just one lodge in Malta under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. The Lodge of St. Andrew No 966 was founded in 1904, and has continued to operate since Maltese independence. It did not join in the formation of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta in 2004, and still reports directly to the Grand Lodge of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nOn 5 September 2004, at a time of Maltese nationalist celebrations marking 40 years of Maltese independence, and 25 years since the closure of the British naval base, and in anticipation of the admission of Malta into the European Union, three of the four Irish Constitution lodges met together and resolved to form themselves into the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta. \n\nThis historic move was supported by one of the English (UGLE) lodges on the island, Count Roger of Normandy Lodge No 9285, and at a special meeting held on 30 June 2004 the lodge resolved to unite with the Irish lodges in the formation of the new Grand Lodge. The fourth Irish Constitution lodge also decided to participate.\nFollowing these events, the Grand Lodge of Ireland, in consultation with the United Grand Lodge of England and the Grand Lodge of Scotland, acceded to the petition of the five lodges. On 18 November 2004, with the Grand Master of Ireland presiding, these 5 lodges were instituted and consecrated by the Grand Lodge of Ireland into The Sovereign Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Malta (SGLoM).\n\nThe effect of having a Grand Lodge is that SGLoM has become the sovereign Masonic body for the Maltese islands, having inherent power and authority to form a Constitution as its fundamental law, and subject only to the Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry to enact laws for its own government and that of its subordinate Lodges. The remaining lodges of other constitutions (two English and one Scottish) may continue to meet in Malta, but new lodges may be founded only by the SGLoM. For months, the representatives of the five founding lodges met and drafted a Book of Constitutions which was adopted at the constituting Grand Lodge Meeting on 18 November 2004.\n\nThe first Grand Master of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta was Joseph Cordina. In April 2005, a research lodge was consecrated named \"Ars Discendi\" (Art of Learning), and in November 2005 the lodge \"Flos Mundi\" (Flower of the World) was consecrated. This latter lodge was intended to attract Maltese and Italian brethren and works in the Italian language. A further new lodge was founded in 2010, named White Sea Lodge. In April 2011 the lodge \"Mare Nostrum\" was consecrated taking the number of subordinate lodges to nine.\n\nThe Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta follows the English and Commonwealth pattern of Freemasonry (as opposed to the alternative Scottish Rite, York Rite, and Swedish Rite styles). This means that Malta recognises the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry (Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason), plus the Order of Royal Arch Freemasonry, as collectively forming the whole of \"pure ancient Freemasonry\". As in England, Royal Arch Chapters may be formed in Malta (with the consent of the Grand Master) and each such Chapter must be attached to a warranted Lodge, and bear the same name and number as that lodge.\n\nThe Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta is recognised by most regular Grand Lodges worldwide.\n\nOn 16 December 2009 a significant number of Maltese Freemasons belonging to Abercorn Lodge, Mikiel Anton Vassalli Lodge, and Logga Fenici withdrew their membership from the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta and established a new Grand Lodge of Malta. They contended that the Constitution of the Sovereign Grand Lodge had been significantly amended so that the Grand Master had been granted absolute powers. They also proposed to establish a masonic Supreme Council to have jurisdiction over the Grand Lodge, a practice which is considered irregular by the majority of the world's established Grand Lodges, including the 'home constitutions', or Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nThe Grand Lodge of Malta (2009) has been recognized by the Grand Orient de France, the Gran Loggia D'Italia and a number of other bodies practicing Continental Freemasonry, considered irregular by the Grand Lodges of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The new Grand Lodge has not been recognised by any of the Regular Masonic jurisdictions worldwide, all of which continue to recognise the Sovereign Grand Lodge of Malta (2004).\n\nThe Grand Lodge of Malta attracted newspaper headlines when Dr David Gatt (a Grand Chancellor of the body) was arrested by Maltese police and charged with a range of serious organised crime offences. He was acquitted in 2017 and all charges quashed\nSome notable residences used by the freemasons in Malta are Villa Blye in Paola, Casa Viani in Valletta, and Villa Sunshine in Ta' Xbiex.\n"}

Ecuador prohibits human trafficking in its penal code, and penalties are commensurate with other serious crimes. Despite robust law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking, conviction rates remain low. The Ecuadorian government has ensured trafficking victims' access to legal, medical, psychological, and shelter services, in large part through its partnership with a network of NGOs. The government has also undertaken advertising campaigns against human trafficking, particularly child labor and child sex tourism. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2\" in 2017.\n\nEcuador is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor. The majority of trafficking victims are believed to be women and children trafficked within the country from border and central highland areas to urban centers for commercial sexual exploitation, as well as for involuntary domestic servitude, forced begging, and forced labor in mines and other hazardous work. There have also been reports of Ecuadorian children being forced to engage in criminal activity, such as drug trafficking and robbery. Parents sometimes send their children to neighboring countries in order to earn money, and Ecuadorian children are found in conditions of forced labor in Colombia, Venezuela, Chile, and the Dominican Republic, particularly as domestic servants, forced vendors, and beggars. Ecuadorian women are subjected to forced prostitution in Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, and Western Europe. To a lesser extent, Ecuador is a destination country for Colombian, Peruvian, and Chinese women and girls in forced prostitution. Indigenous Ecuadorians are vulnerable to forced labor in domestic servitude. Child sex tourism occurs mostly in urban areas, and in tourist destinations, such as Tena and the Galapagos Islands. Ecuador is a transit country for Chinese nationals smuggled to destinations elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere; some of these migrants are trafficked.\n\nEcuador prohibits all forms of human trafficking in Article 190 of its penal code, amended in 2005; trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation carries a punishment of six to nine years' imprisonment, and trafficking for sexual exploitation carries a penalty of eight to 12 years' imprisonment. Penalties for human trafficking may be increased, by aggravating circumstances, to a maximum of 35 years' imprisonment. Such penalties are commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Other statutes, such as Article 528.13, which prohibits the commercial sexual exploitation of children, are also used to prosecute human trafficking crimes.\n\nDespite reports of trafficking-related corruption, particularly related to civil registry officials issuing false identity documents to children, no investigations, prosecutions, or convictions of potentially complicit officials took place last year. According to Ecuadorian police, brothel owners commonly use false identity documents to exploit children in prostitution, and to avoid criminal liability for immigration and trafficking violations in the event of a police raid.\n\nMost cases of human trafficking investigated in Ecuador during 2009 involved forced prostitution, particularly of children. A growing number of investigations are related to labor exploitation of children and adults, but do not appear commensurate with the incidence of forced labor in the country, particularly the large number of children exploited for forced begging and forced domestic work. The government has provided police specializing in crimes against children with specific training on trafficking in persons. Ecuadorian authorities have formed partnerships with Colombian, Venezuelan, U.S., and Chinese officials to jointly investigate several trafficking cases.\n\nThe Ecuadorian government has ensured trafficking victims' access to legal, medical, psychological, and shelter services, in large part through its partnership with a network of NGOs that received funding from the government and international organizations. Women and girls are eligible for shelter services, while the government provides boys and men with victim services on an ad hoc basis, though shelters for trafficking victims remain lacking in parts of the country. Foreign victims are eligible for the same services as Ecuadorian trafficking victims. In addition to these short-term services, the government provides victims with counseling, protection, job training, and educational training, and ensures that child victims received long-term care as needed. Through its Victim and Witness Protection Program, the Ecuadorian government operates specialized police units in the cities of Guayaquil, Machala, Portoviejo, Cuenca, and Quito. These units accompany other police authorities on brothel raids to coordinate immediate protective services toward identified trafficking victims, and assistance for victim witnesses during court proceedings. The government encourages victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. While Ecuadorian authorities have conducted raids on establishments to rescue children in prostitution, according to the U.S. government they did not demonstrate adequate efforts to identify adult trafficking victims among women exploited in brothels and other vulnerable populations. In 2009, police removed 33 children from commercial sexual exploitation and five from conditions of forced labor. Authorities did not penalize identified trafficking victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The Ecuadorian government does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution, though foreign victims are not typically deported from the country. The government provides victim services to repatriated Ecuadorian trafficking victims. Ecuadorian authorities have developed trafficking in persons protocols for consular officers abroad and have begun training their diplomatic corps in these procedures.\n\nThe Ecuadorian government has undertaken vigorous public awareness campaigns against child forced labor and prostitution. The government has forged partnerships with private telecommunications companies and a bank to combat child labor, in part through a network of schools for former child laborers. During December 2009, the government launched a national campaign against child begging and a radio soap opera series about the dangers of forced labor, which was broadcast on provincial radio stations in Spanish and Kichwa, a local language. State-owned radio stations have also donated airtime to an NGO in the highlands to broadcast messages on how to identify and avoid human trafficking situations. The Ecuadorian Ministry of Tourism has launched a nationwide campaign to prevent the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the tourism industry, and the government has continued a multimedia campaign in 20 departments to encourage citizens to identify and report trafficking cases. The government, however, has not taken steps to reduce demand for commercial sex acts purchased from adults or forced labor of adults.\n"}
{"id": "15319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15319", "title": "Inca Empire", "text": "Inca Empire\n\nThe Inca Empire (,  \"The Four Regions\"), also known as the Incan Empire and the Inka Empire, was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America. Its political and administrative structure is considered by most scholars to have been the most developed in the Americas before Columbus' arrival. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in Cusco in modern-day Peru. The Inca civilization arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century. Its last stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nFrom 1438 to 1533, the Incas incorporated a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean Mountains, using conquest and peaceful assimilation, among other methods. At its largest, the empire joined Peru, large parts of modern Ecuador, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and central Chile and a small part of southwest Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia. Its official language was Quechua. Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred \"Huacas\", but the Inca leadership encouraged the sun worship of Inti – their sun god – and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama. The Incas considered their king, the Sapa Inca, to be the \"son of the sun.\"\n\nThe Inca Empire was unique in that it lacked many features associated with civilization in the Old World. In the words of one scholar,\n\nThe Incan economy has been described in contradictory ways by scholars:\n\nThe Inca empire functioned largely without money and without markets. Instead, exchange of goods and services was based on reciprocity between individuals and among individuals, groups, and Inca rulers. \"Taxes\" consisted of a labour obligation of a person to the Empire. The Inca rulers (who theoretically owned all the means of production) reciprocated by granting access to land and goods and providing food and drink in celebratory feasts for their subjects.\n\nThe Inca referred to their empire as \"Tawantinsuyu\", \"the four \"suyu\"\". In Quechua, \"tawa\" is four and \"-ntin\" is a suffix naming a group, so that a \"tawantin\" is a quartet, a group of four things taken together, in this case representing the four \"suyu\" (\"regions\" or \"provinces\") whose corners met at the capital. The four \"suyu\" were: Chinchaysuyu (north), Antisuyu (east; the Amazon jungle), Qullasuyu (south) and Kuntisuyu (west). The name \"Tawantinsuyu\" was, therefore, a descriptive term indicating a union of provinces. The Spanish transliterated the name as \"Tahuatinsuyo\" or \"Tahuatinsuyu\".\n\nThe term \"Inka\" means \"ruler\" or \"lord\" in Quechua and was used to refer to the ruling class or the ruling family. The Incas were a very small percentage of the total population of the empire, probably numbering only 15,000 to 40,000, but ruling a population of around 10 million people. The Spanish adopted the term (transliterated as \"Inca\" in Spanish) as an ethnic term referring to all subjects of the empire rather than simply the ruling class. As such, the name \"Imperio inca\" (\"Inca Empire\") referred to the nation that they encountered and subsequently conquered.\n\nThe Inca Empire was the last chapter of thousands of years of Andean civilization. Andean civilization was one of five civilizations in the world deemed by scholars to be \"pristine\", that is indigenous and not derivative from other civilizations.\n\nThe Inca Empire was preceded by two large-scale empires in the Andes: the Tiwanaku (c. 300–1100 AD), based around Lake Titicaca and the Wari or Huari (c. 600–1100 AD) centered near the present-day city of Ayacucho. The Wari occupied the Cuzco area for about 400 years. Thus, many of the characteristics of the Inca Empire derived from earlier multi-ethnic and expansive Andean cultures.\n\nCarl Troll has argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the staple food chuño. Chuño, which can be stored for long periods, is made of potato dried at the freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern Peruvian highlands. Such link between the Inca state and chuño may be questioned as potatoes and other crops such as maize can also be dried with only sunlight. Troll did also argue that llamas, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region. It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of llamas and alpacas in Pre-Hispanic America. The link between the Andean biomes of puna and páramo, pastoralism and the Inca state is a matter of research. As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building. While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed environmental determinism arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.\n\nThe Inca people were a pastoral tribe in the Cusco area around the 12th century. Incan oral history tells an origin story of three caves. The center cave at Tampu T'uqu \"(Tambo Tocco)\" was named Qhapaq T'uqu (\"principal niche\", also spelled \"Capac Tocco\"). The other caves were Maras T'uqu \"(Maras Tocco)\" and Sutiq T'uqu \"(Sutic Tocco)\". Four brothers and four sisters stepped out of the middle cave. They were: Ayar Manco, Ayar Cachi, Ayar Awqa \"(Ayar Auca)\" and Ayar Uchu; and Mama Ocllo, Mama Raua, Mama Huaco and Mama Qura \"(Mama Cora)\". Out of the side caves came the people who were to be the ancestors of all the Inca clans.\n\nAyar Manco carried a magic staff made of the finest gold. Where this staff landed, the people would live. They traveled for a long time. On the way, Ayar Cachi boasted about his strength and power. His siblings tricked him into returning to the cave to get a sacred llama. When he went into the cave, they trapped him inside to get rid of him.\n\nAyar Uchu decided to stay on the top of the cave to look over the Inca people. The minute he proclaimed that, he turned to stone. They built a shrine around the stone and it became a sacred object. Ayar Auca grew tired of all this and decided to travel alone. Only Ayar Manco and his four sisters remained.\n\nFinally, they reached Cusco. The staff sank into the ground. Before they arrived, Mama Ocllo had already borne Ayar Manco a child, Sinchi Roca. The people who were already living in Cusco fought hard to keep their land, but Mama Huaca was a good fighter. When the enemy attacked, she threw her bolas (several stones tied together that spun through the air when thrown) at a soldier (gualla) and killed him instantly. The other people became afraid and ran away.\n\nAfter that, Ayar Manco became known as Manco Cápac, the founder of the Inca. It is said that he and his sisters built the first Inca homes in the valley with their own hands. When the time came, Manco Cápac turned to stone like his brothers before him. His son, Sinchi Roca, became the second emperor of the Inca.\n\nUnder the leadership of Manco Cápac, the Inca formed the small city-state Kingdom of Cusco (Quechua \"Qusqu', Qosqo\"). In 1438, they began a far-reaching expansion under the command of Sapa Inca (paramount leader) Pachacuti-Cusi Yupanqui, whose name literally meant \"earth-shaker\". The name of Pachacuti was given to him after he conquered the Tribe of Chancas (modern Apurímac). During his reign, he and his son Tupac Yupanqui brought much of the Andes mountains (roughly modern Peru and Ecuador) under Inca control.\n\nPachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cusco into the Tahuantinsuyu, which consisted of a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). Pachacuti is thought to have built Machu Picchu, either as a family home or summer retreat, although it may have been an agricultural station.\n\nPachacuti sent spies to regions he wanted in his empire and they brought to him reports on political organization, military strength and wealth. He then sent messages to their leaders extolling the benefits of joining his empire, offering them presents of luxury goods such as high quality textiles and promising that they would be materially richer as his subjects.\n\nMost accepted the rule of the Inca as a \"fait accompli\" and acquiesced peacefully. Refusal to accept Inca rule resulted in military conquest. Following conquest the local rulers were executed. The ruler's children were brought to Cusco to learn about Inca administration systems, then return to rule their native lands. This allowed the Inca to indoctrinate them into the Inca nobility and, with luck, marry their daughters into families at various corners of the empire.\n\nTraditionally the son of the Inca ruler led the army. Pachacuti's son Túpac Inca Yupanqui began conquests to the north in 1463 and continued them as Inca ruler after Pachacuti's death in 1471. Túpac Inca's most important conquest was the Kingdom of Chimor, the Inca's only serious rival for the Peruvian coast. Túpac Inca's empire stretched north into modern-day Ecuador and Colombia.\n\nTúpac Inca's son Huayna Cápac added a small portion of land to the north in modern-day Ecuador and in parts of Peru. At its height, the Inca Empire included Peru and Bolivia, most of what is now Ecuador and a large portion of what is today Chile, north of the Maule River. The advance south halted after the Battle of the Maule where they met determined resistance from the Mapuche. The empire's push into the Amazon Basin near the Chinchipe River was stopped by the Shuar in 1527. The empire extended into corners of Argentina and Colombia. However, most of the southern portion of the Inca empire, the portion denominated as Qullasuyu, was located in the Altiplano.\n\nThe Inca Empire was an amalgamation of languages, cultures and peoples. The components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal, nor were the local cultures all fully integrated. The Inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labour. The following quote describes a method of taxation:\n\nFor as is well known to all, not a single village of the highlands or the plains failed to pay the tribute levied on it by those who were in charge of these matters. There were even provinces where, when the natives alleged that they were unable to pay their tribute, the Inca ordered that each inhabitant should be obliged to turn in every four months a large quill full of live lice, which was the Inca's way of teaching and accustoming them to pay tribute.\n\nSpanish conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro and his brothers explored south from what is today Panama, reaching Inca territory by 1526. It was clear that they had reached a wealthy land with prospects of great treasure, and after another expedition in 1529 Pizarro traveled to Spain and received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy. This approval was received as detailed in the following quote: \"In July 1529 the queen of Spain signed a charter allowing Pizarro to conquer the Incas. Pizarro was named governor and captain of all conquests in Peru, or New Castile, as the Spanish now called the land.\"\n\nWhen they returned to Peru in 1532, a war of succession between the sons of Sapa Inca Huayna Capac, Huáscar and Atahualpa, and unrest among newly conquered territories weakened the empire. Perhaps more importantly, smallpox, influenza, typhus and measles had spread from Central America.\n\nThe forces led by Pizarro consisted of 168 men, one cannon, and 27 horses. Conquistadors ported lances, arquebuses, steel armor and long swords. In contrast, the Inca used weapons made out of wood, stone, copper and bronze, putting them at significant technological disadvantage. In addition, due to the absence of horses in the Americas, the Inca did not develop tactics to fight cavalry. However, the Inca were still effective warriors, being able to successfully fight the Mapuche, which later would strategically defeat the Spanish as they expanded further south.\n\nThe first engagement between the Inca and the Spanish was the Battle of Puná, near present-day Guayaquil, Ecuador, on the Pacific Coast; Pizarro then founded the city of Piura in July 1532. Hernando de Soto was sent inland to explore the interior and returned with an invitation to meet the Inca, Atahualpa, who had defeated his brother in the civil war and was resting at Cajamarca with his army of 80,000 troops, that were at the moment armed only with hunting tools (knives and lassos for hunting llamas).\n\nPizarro and some of his men, most notably a friar named Vincente de Valverde, met with the Inca, who had brought only a small retinue. The Inca offered them ceremonial chicha in a golden cup, which the Spanish rejected. The Spanish interpreter, Friar Vincente, read the \"Requerimiento\" that demanded that he and his empire accept the rule of King Charles I of Spain and convert to Christianity. Atahualpa dismissed the message and asked them to leave. After this, the Spanish began their attack against the mostly unarmed Inca, captured Atahualpa as hostage, and forced the Inca to collaborate.\n\nAtahualpa offered the Spaniards enough gold to fill the room he was imprisoned in and twice that amount of silver. The Inca fulfilled this ransom, but Pizarro deceived them, refusing to release the Inca afterwards. During Atahualpa's imprisonment Huáscar was assassinated elsewhere. The Spaniards maintained that this was at Atahualpa's orders; this was used as one of the charges against Atahualpa when the Spaniards finally executed him, in August 1533.\n\nAlthough \"defeat\" often implies an unwanted loss in battle, much of the Inca elite \"actually welcomed the Spanish invaders as liberators and willingly settled down with them to share rule of Andean farmers and miners.\"\n\nThe Spanish installed Atahualpa's brother Manco Inca Yupanqui in power; for some time Manco cooperated with the Spanish while they fought to put down resistance in the north. Meanwhile, an associate of Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, attempted to claim Cusco. Manco tried to use this intra-Spanish feud to his advantage, recapturing Cusco in 1536, but the Spanish retook the city afterwards. Manco Inca then retreated to the mountains of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo-Inca State, where he and his successors ruled for another 36 years, sometimes raiding the Spanish or inciting revolts against them. In 1572 the last Inca stronghold was conquered and the last ruler, Túpac Amaru, Manco's son, was captured and executed. This ended resistance to the Spanish conquest under the political authority of the Inca state.\n\nAfter the fall of the Inca Empire many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system, known as the vertical archipelago model of agriculture. Spanish colonial officials used the Inca mita corvée labor system for colonial aims, sometimes brutally. One member of each family was forced to work in the gold and silver mines, the foremost of which was the titanic silver mine at Potosí. When a family member died, which would usually happen within a year or two, the family was required to send a replacement.\n\nThe effects of smallpox on the Inca empire were even more devastating. Beginning in Colombia, smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system. Smallpox was only the first epidemic. Other diseases, including a probable Typhus outbreak in 1546, influenza and smallpox together in 1558, smallpox again in 1589, diphtheria in 1614, and measles in 1618, all ravaged the Inca people.\n\nThe number of people inhabiting Tawantinsuyu at its peak is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 4–37 million. Most population estimates are in the range of 6 to 14 million. In spite of the fact that the Inca kept excellent census records using their quipus, knowledge of how to read them was lost as almost all fell into disuse and disintegrated over time or were destroyed by the Spaniards.\n\nThe main form of communication and record-keeping in the empire were quipus, ceramics, textiles and various dialects of Quechua, the language the Incas imposed upon the peoples within the empire. While Quechua had been spoken in the Andean region, including central Peru, for several centuries prior to the expansion of the Inca civilization, the dialect of Quechua the Incas imposed was an adaptation from the Kingdom of Cusco (an early form of \"Southern Quechua\" originally named Qhapaq Runasimi, or 'the great language of the people'), or what some historians define as the Cusco dialect.\n\nThe language imposed by the Incas diverted from its original phonetics as some societies formed their own regional varieties. The diversity of Quechua at that point and even today does not come directly from the Incas, who were just a part of the reason for Quechua's diversity. The civilizations within the empire that had previously spoken Quechua kept their own variety distinct from the Quechua the Incas spread. Although these dialects of Quechua had a similar linguistic structure, they differed according to the region in which they were spoken.\n\nAlthough many of the societies within the empire spoke or learned to speak Quechua, others continued to speak their original languages, such as Aymara, which remains in use in contemporary Bolivia, where it is the primary indigenous language and in various regions surrounding Bolivia. The linguistic body of the Inca Empire was thus varied. The Inca's impact outlasted their empire, as the Spanish continued the use of Quechua.\n\nThe Incas were not known to develop a written form of communication; however, they visually recorded narratives through paintings on vases and cups (qirus). These paintings are usually accompanied by geometric patterns known as toqapu, which are also found in textiles. Researchers have speculated that toqapu patterns could have served as a form of written communication (e.g.: heraldry, or glyphs), however this remains unclear.\n\nThe high infant mortality rates that plagued the Inca Empire caused newborn infants to solely be given the term ‘wawa’ when they were born. Most families did not invest very much into their child until they reached the age of two, or most of the times three years old. Once the child reached the age of three a ‘coming of age’ ceremony occurred. This ceremony was called the \"rutuchikuy\" ritual. For the Incas this ceremony indicated that the child had entered the stage of ‘ignorance’. During this ceremony the family would invite all relatives to their house for food and dance and then each member of the family would receive a lock of hair from the young child. After each family member had received a piece of the hair, the father would then shave the child’s head. According to Covey, this stage of life was categorized by a stage of “ignorance, inexperience, and lack of reason, a condition that the child would overcome with time.” For the Incan society in order to advance from the stage of ignorance to development the child must learn the roles around the family associated with their gender.\n\nThe next important ritual was to celebrate the maturity of child. Unlike the previous ritual ceremony, the celebration of maturity was to signify the child's sexual potency. In the western world this ceremony would be known as a celebration of puberty, however for the Incas it was called \"warachikuy\" for boys and \"qikuchikuy\" for girls. The \"warachikuy\" ceremony included dancing, fasting, tasks to show their strength, and family ceremonies. The boy would also be given new clothes and taught how to act as an unmarried man. On the other hand, the girls ceremony \"qikuchikuy\" signified the onset of menstruation, therefore the girl would go into the forest alone and not return until the bleeding had ended. In the forest she would fast, and upon arrival the girl would be given a new name, adult clothing, and advice. This 'folly' stage of life was important because this was the time the young adults could have sex without having to be a parent.\n\nBetween the ages 20-30 the young adults were \"ripe for serious thought and labor\". The young adults were able to hold on to their 'youthful status' during this age by living at home and helping out their home community. The young adults only reached their 'full potential' once they were married.\n\nIn the end, the male and female terms describe the individuals loss of sexual vitality and humanity. Specifically, the decrepitude stage signifies the loss of their mental well being and further physical dystrophy.\nIn the Incan Empire, the age of marriage differed for men and women; men typically married at the age of 20, while women usually got married around 4 years earlier at the age of 16. Men who were highly ranked in society could have multiple wives, but those lower in the ranks could only take a single wife. Marriages were typically within classes and resembled a more business-like agreement. Once married, the women were expected to cook, collect food and watch over the children and livestock. Girls and mothers would also work around the house to keep it orderly to please the public inspectors. These duties remained the same even after wives became pregnant and with the added responsibility of praying and making offerings to Kanopa, who was the god of pregnancy. It was typical for marriages to begin on a trial basis with both men and women having a say in the longevity of the marriage. If the man felt that it wouldn’t work out or if the woman wanted to return to her parent’s home the marriage would end. Once the marriage was final, the only way the two could be divorced was if they did not have a child together. Marriage within the Empire was crucial for survival. A family was considered disadvantaged if there was not a married couple at the center because everyday life centered around the balance of male and female tasks. \n\nIn the eyes of the Inca, male and female roles were considered equal. The \"indigenous cultures saw the two genders as complementary parts of a whole.\" In other words, there was not a hierarchical structure in the domestic sphere for the Incas. Within the domestic sphere, women were known as the weavers. Women's everyday tasks included: spinning, watching the children, weaving cloth, cooking, brewing chichi, preparing fields for cultivation, planting seeds, bearing children, harvesting, weeding, hoeing, herding, and carrying water. Men on the other hand, \"weeded, plowed, participated in combat, helped in the harvest, carried firewood, built houses, herded llama and alpaca, and spun and wove when necessary\". On looking Spaniards did not understand the complementary nature of men and women roles within the Inca culture and believed women were treated like slaves. However, Inca women did not view themselves as slaves, nor did they do their job for the man. The women completed their daily tasks for the improvement of her household and community, to ensure her family would survive. Furthermore, women were allowed to own land and herds because inheritance was passed down from both the mother's and father's side of the family . Kinship within the Inca society followed a parallel line of descent. In other words, women ascended from women and men ascended from men. Due to the parallel descent, women had access to land and other necessities through her mother, and communities flourished because of the environmental social ties among women .\n\nInca myths were transmitted orally until early Spanish colonists recorded them; however, some scholars claim that they were recorded on quipus, Andean knotted string records.\n\nThe Inca believed in reincarnation. After death, the passage to the next world was fraught with difficulties. The spirit of the dead, \"camaquen,\" would need to follow a long road and during the trip the assistance of a black dog that could see in the dark was required. Most Incas imagined the after world to be like an earthly paradise with flower-covered fields and snow-capped mountains.\n\nIt was important to the Inca that they not die as a result of burning or that the body of the deceased not be incinerated. Burning would cause their vital force to disappear and threaten their passage to the after world. Those who obeyed the Inca moral code – \"ama suwa, ama llulla, ama quella\" (do not steal, do not lie, do not be lazy) – \"went to live in the Sun's warmth while others spent their eternal days in the cold earth\". The Inca nobility practiced cranial deformation. They wrapped tight cloth straps around the heads of newborns to shape their soft skulls into a more conical form, thus distinguishing the nobility from other social classes.\n\nThe Incas made human sacrifices. As many as 4,000 servants, court officials, favorites and concubines were killed upon the death of the Inca Huayna Capac in 1527. The Incas performed child sacrifices around important events, such as the death of the Sapa Inca or during a famine. These sacrifices were known as \"qhapaq hucha\".\n\nThe Incas were polytheists who worshipped many gods. These included:\n\n\nThe Inca Empire employed central planning. The Inca Empire traded with outside regions, although they did not operate a substantial internal market economy. While axe-monies were used along the northern coast, presumably by the provincial \"mindaláe\" trading class, most households in the empire lived in a traditional economy in which households were required to pay taxes, usually in the form of the \"mit'a\" corvée labor, and military obligations, though barter (or \"trueque\") was present in some areas. In return, the state provided security, food in times of hardship through the supply of emergency resources, agricultural projects (e.g. aqueducts and terraces) to increase productivity and occasional feasts. The economy rested on the material foundations of the vertical archipelago, a system of ecological complementarity in accessing resources and the cultural foundation of \"ayni\", or reciprocal exchange.\n\nThe Sapa Inca was conceptualized as divine and was effectively head of the state religion. The \"Willaq Umu\" (or Chief Priest) was second to the emperor. Local religious traditions continued and in some cases such as the Oracle at Pachacamac on the Peruvian coast, were officially venerated. Following Pachacuti, the Sapa Inca claimed descent from Inti, who placed a high value on imperial blood; by the end of the empire, it was common to incestuously wed brother and sister. He was \"son of the sun,\" and his people the \"intip churin\", or \"children of the sun,\" and both his right to rule and mission to conquer derived from his holy ancestor. The Sapa Inca also presided over ideologically important festivals, notably during the \"Inti Raymi\", or \"Sunfest\" attended by soldiers, mummified rulers, nobles, clerics and the general population of Cusco beginning on the June solstice and culminating nine days later with the ritual breaking of the earth using a foot plow by the Inca. Moreover, Cusco was considered cosmologically central, loaded as it was with \"huacas\" and radiating \"ceque\" lines and geographic center of the Four Quarters; Inca Garcilaso de la Vega called it \"the navel of the universe\".\n\nThe Inca Empire was a federalist system consisting of a central government with the Inca at its head and four quarters, or \"suyu\": Chinchay Suyu (NW), Anti Suyu (NE), Kunti Suyu (SW) and Qulla Suyu (SE). The four corners of these quarters met at the center, Cusco. These \"suyu\" were likely created around 1460 during the reign of Pachacuti before the empire reached its largest territorial extent. At the time the \"suyu\" were established they were roughly of equal size and only later changed their proportions as the empire expanded north and south along the Andes.\n\nCusco was likely not organized as a \"wamani\", or province. Rather, it was probably somewhat akin to a modern federal district, like Washington, D.C. or Mexico City. The city sat at the center of the four \"suyu\" and served as the preeminent center of politics and religion. While Cusco was essentially governed by the Sapa Inca, his relatives and the royal \"panaqa\" lineages, each \"suyu\" was governed by an \"Apu\", a term of esteem used for men of high status and for venerated mountains. Both Cusco as a district and the four \"suyu\" as administrative regions were grouped into upper \"hanan\" and lower \"hurin\" divisions. As the Inca did not have written records, it is impossible to exhaustively list the constituent \"wamani\". However, colonial records allow us to reconstruct a partial list. There were likely more than 86 \"wamani\", with more than 48 in the highlands and more than 38 on the coast.\n\nThe most populous \"suyu\" was Chinchaysuyu, which encompassed the former Chimu empire and much of the northern Andes. At its largest extent, it extended through much of modern Ecuador and into modern Colombia.\n\nThe largest \"suyu\" by area was Qullasuyu, named after the Aymara-speaking Qulla people. It encompassed the Bolivian Altiplano and much of the southern Andes, reaching Argentina and as far south as the Maipo or Maule river in Central Chile. Historian José Bengoa singled out Quillota as likely being the foremost Inca settlement in Chile.\n\nThe second smallest \"suyu\", Antisuyu, was northwest of Cusco in the high Andes. Its name is the root of the word \"Andes.\"\n\nKuntisuyu was the smallest \"suyu\", located along the southern coast of modern Peru, extending into the highlands towards Cusco.\n\nThe Inca state had no separate judiciary or codified laws. Customs, expectations and traditional local power holders governed behavior. The state had legal force, such as through \"tokoyrikoq\" (lit. \"he who sees all\"), or inspectors. The highest such inspector, typically a blood relative to the Sapa Inca, acted independently of the conventional hierarchy, providing a point of view for the Sapa Inca free of bureaucratic influence.\n\nThe Inca had three moral precepts that governed their behavior:\n\n\nColonial sources are not entirely clear or in agreement about Inca government structure, such as exact duties and functions of government positions. But the basic structure can be broadly described. The top was the \"Sapa Inca\". Below that may have been the \"Willaq Umu\", literally the \"priest who recounts\", the High Priest of the Sun. However, beneath the \"Sapa Inca\" also sat the \"Inkap rantin\", who was a confidant and assistant to the \"Sapa Inca\", perhaps similar to a Prime Minister. Starting with Topa Inca Yupanqui, a \"Council of the Realm\" was composed of 16 nobles: 2 from \"hanan\" Cusco; 2 from \"hurin\" Cusco; 4 from Chinchaysuyu; 2 from Cuntisuyu; 4 from Collasuyu; and 2 from Antisuyu. This weighting of representation balanced the \"hanan\" and \"hurin\" divisions of the empire, both within Cusco and within the Quarters (\"hanan suyukuna\" and \"hurin suyukuna\").\n\nWhile provincial bureaucracy and government varied greatly, the basic organization was decimal. Taxpayers – male heads of household of a certain age range – were organized into corvée labor units (often doubling as military units) that formed the state's muscle as part of mit'a service. Each unit of more than 100 tax-payers were headed by a \"kuraka\", while smaller units were headed by a \"kamayuq\", a lower, non-hereditary status. However, while \"kuraka\" status was hereditary and typically served for life, the position of a \"kuraka\" in the hierarchy was subject to change based on the privileges of superiors in the hierarchy; a \"pachaka kuraka\" could be appointed to the position by a \"waranqa kuraka\". Furthermore, one \"kuraka\" in each decimal level could serve as the head of one of the nine groups at a lower level, so that a \"pachaka kuraka\" might also be a \"waranqa kuraka\", in effect directly responsible for one unit of 100 tax-payers and less directly responsible for nine other such units.\n\nArchitecture was the most important of the Incan arts, with textiles reflecting architectural motifs. The most notable example is Machu Picchu, which was constructed by Inca engineers. The prime Inca structures were made of stone blocks that fit together so well that a knife could not be fitted through the stonework. These constructs have survived for centuries, with no use of mortar to sustain them.\n\nThis process was first used on a large scale by the Pucara (ca. 300 BC–AD 300) peoples to the south in Lake Titicaca and later in the city of Tiwanaku (ca. AD 400–1100) in present-day Bolivia. The rocks were sculpted to fit together exactly by repeatedly lowering a rock onto another and carving away any sections on the lower rock where the dust was compressed. The tight fit and the concavity on the lower rocks made them extraordinarily stable, despite the ongoing challenge of earthquakes and volcanic activity.\n\nPhysical measures used by the Inca were based on human body parts. Units included fingers, the distance from thumb to forefinger, palms, cubits and wingspans. The most basic distance unit was \"thatkiy\" or \"thatki\", or one pace. The next largest unit was reported by Cobo to be the \"topo\" or \"tupu\", measuring 6,000 \"thatkiy\"s, or about ; careful study has shown that a range of is likely. Next was the \"wamani\", composed of 30 \"topo\"s (roughly ). To measure area, 25 by 50 wingspans were used, reckoned in \"topo\"s (roughly ). It seems likely that distance was often interpreted as one day's walk; the distance between \"tambo\" way-stations varies widely in terms of distance, but far less in terms of time to walk that distance.\n\nInca calendars were strongly tied to astronomy. Inca astronomers understood equinoxes, solstices and zenith passages, along with the Venus cycle. They could not, however, predict eclipses. The Inca calendar was essentially lunisolar, as two calendars were maintained in parallel, one solar and one lunar. As 12 lunar months fall 11 days short of a full 365-day solar year, those in charge of the calendar had to adjust every winter solstice. Each lunar month was marked with festivals and rituals. Apparently, the days of the week were not named and days were not grouped into weeks. Similarly, months were not grouped into seasons. Time during a day was not measured in hours or minutes, but in terms of how far the sun had travelled or in how long it had taken to perform a task.\n\nThe sophistication of Inca administration, calendrics and engineering required facility with numbers. Numerical information was stored in the knots of \"quipu\" strings, allowing for compact storage of large numbers. These numbers were stored in base-10 digits, the same base used by the Quechua language and in administrative and military units. These numbers, stored in \"quipu\", could be calculated on \"yupanas\", grids with squares of positionally varying mathematical values, perhaps functioning as an abacus. Calculation was facilitated by moving piles of tokens, seeds or pebbles between compartments of the \"yupana\". It is likely that Inca mathematics at least allowed division of integers into integers or fractions and multiplication of integers and fractions.\n\nAccording to mid-17th-century Jesuit chronicler Bernabé Cobo, the Inca designated officials to perform accounting-related tasks. These officials were called quipo camayos. Study of khipu sample VA 42527 (Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin) revealed that the numbers arranged in calendrically significant patterns were used for agricultural purposes in the \"farm account books\" kept by the khipukamayuq (accountant or warehouse keeper) to facilitate the closing of accounting books.\n\nCeramics were painted using the polychrome technique portraying numerous motifs including animals, birds, waves, felines (popular in the Chavin culture) and geometric patterns found in the Nazca style of ceramics. In a culture without a written language, ceramics portrayed the basic scenes of everyday life, including the smelting of metals, relationships and scenes of tribal warfare. The most distinctive Inca ceramic objects are the Cusco bottles or \"aryballos\". Many of these pieces are on display in Lima in the Larco Archaeological Museum and the National Museum of Archaeology, Anthropology and History.\n\nAlmost all of the gold and silver work of the Incan empire was melted down by the conquistadors.\n\nThe Inca recorded information on assemblages of knotted strings, known as Quipu, although they can no longer be decoded. Originally it was thought that Quipu were used only as mnemonic devices or to record numerical data. Quipus are also believed to record history and literature.\n\nThe Inca made many discoveries in medicine. They performed successful skull surgery, by cutting holes in the skull to alleviate fluid buildup and inflammation caused by head wounds. Many skull surgeries performed by Inca surgeons were successful. Survival rates were 80–90%, compared to about 30% before Inca times.\n\nThe Incas revered the coca plant as sacred/magical. Its leaves were used in moderate amounts to lessen hunger and pain during work, but were mostly used for religious and health purposes. The Spaniards took advantage of the effects of chewing coca leaves. The Chasqui, messengers who ran throughout the empire to deliver messages, chewed coca leaves for extra energy. Coca leaves were also used as an anaesthetic during surgeries.\n\nThe Inca army was the most powerful at that time, because they could turn an ordinary villager or farmer into a soldier. Every able bodied male Inca of fighting age had to take part in war in some capacity at least once and to prepare for warfare again when needed. By the time the empire reached its largest size, every section of the empire contributed in setting up an army for war.\n\nThe Incas had no iron or steel and their weapons were not much more effective than those of their opponents. They went into battle with drums beating and trumpets blowing. Their armor included:\n\nThe Inca weaponry included:\n\nRoads allowed quick movement (on foot) for the Inca army and shelters called \"tambo\" and storage silos called qullqas were built one day's travelling distance from each other, so that an army on campaign could always be fed and rested. This can be seen in names of ruins such as \"Ollantay Tambo\", or My Lord's Storehouse. These were set up so the Inca and his entourage would always have supplies (and possibly shelter) ready as they traveled.\n\nChronicles and references from the 16th and 17th centuries support the idea of a banner. However, it represented the Inca (emperor), not the empire.\n\nFrancisco López de Jerez wrote in 1534:\n... todos venían repartidos en sus escuadras con sus banderas y capitanes que los mandan, con tanto concierto como turcos.(... all of them came distributed into squads, with their flags and captains commanding them, as well-ordered as Turks.) \n\nChronicler Bernabé Cobo wrote:\n\nThe royal standard or banner was a small square flag, ten or twelve spans around, made of cotton or wool cloth, placed on the end of a long staff, stretched and stiff such that it did not wave in the air and on it each king painted his arms and emblems, for each one chose different ones, though the sign of the Incas was the rainbow and two parallel snakes along the width with the tassel as a crown, which each king used to add for a badge or blazon those preferred, like a lion, an eagle and other figures.\n\n<br>(... el guión o estandarte real era una banderilla cuadrada y pequeña, de diez o doce palmos de ruedo, hecha de lienzo de algodón o de lana, iba puesta en el remate de una asta larga, tendida y tiesa, sin que ondease al aire, y en ella pintaba cada rey sus armas y divisas, porque cada uno las escogía diferentes, aunque las generales de los Incas eran el arco celeste y dos culebras tendidas a lo largo paralelas con la borda que le servía de corona, a las cuales solía añadir por divisa y blasón cada rey las que le parecía, como un león, un águila y otras figuras.)<br>-\n\nGuaman Poma's 1615 book, \"El primer nueva corónica y buen gobierno\", shows numerous line drawings of Inca flags. In his 1847 book \"A History of the Conquest of Peru\", \"William H. Prescott ... says that in the Inca army each company had its particular banner and that the imperial standard, high above all, displayed the glittering device of the rainbow, the armorial ensign of the Incas.\" A 1917 world flags book says the Inca \"heir-apparent ... was entitled to display the royal standard of the rainbow in his military campaigns.\"\n\nIn modern times the rainbow flag has been wrongly associated with the Tawantinsuyu and displayed as a symbol of Inca heritage by some groups in Peru and Bolivia. The city of Cusco also flies the Rainbow Flag, but as an official flag of the city. The Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo (2001–2006) flew the Rainbow Flag in Lima's presidential palace. However, according to Peruvian historiography, the Inca Empire never had a flag. Peruvian historian María Rostworowski said, \"I bet my life, the Inca never had that flag, it never existed, no chronicler mentioned it\". Also, to the Peruvian newspaper \"El Comercio\", the flag dates to the first decades of the 20th century, and even the Congress of the Republic of Peru has determined that flag is a fake by citing the conclusion of National Academy of Peruvian History:\n\n\"The official use of the wrongly called 'Tawantinsuyu flag' is a mistake. In the Pre-Hispanic Andean World there did not exist the concept of a flag, it did not belong to their historic context\".\n<br>National Academy of Peruvian History\n\nIncas were able to adapt to their high-altitude living through successful acclimatization, which is characterized by increasing oxygen supply to the blood tissues. For the native Inca living in the Andean highlands, this was achieved through the development of a larger lung capacity, and an increase in red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentration, and capillary beds.\n\nCompared to other humans, the Incas had slower heart rates, almost one-third larger lung capacity, about 2 L (4 pints) more blood volume and double the amount of hemoglobin, which transfers oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. While the Conquistadors may have been slightly taller, the Inca had the advantage of coping with the extraordinary altitude.\n\n\n\n"}

The all India IIP is a composite indicator that measures the short-term changes in the volume of production of a basket of industrial products during a given period with respect to that in a chosen base period. It is compiled and published monthly by the central statistical organisation (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation six weeks after the reference month ends. \n\nThe level of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is an abstract number, the magnitude of which represents the status of production in the industrial sector for a given period of time as compared to a reference period of time. The base year was at one time fixed at 1993–94 so that year was assigned an index level of 100. The current base year is 2011-2012..\n\nThe Eight Core Industries comprise nearly 40.27% of the weight of items included in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). These are Electricity , steel, refinery products, crude oil, coal, cement, natural gas and fertilisers.\n\nThe first official attempt to compute the IIP was made much earlier than even the recommendations on the subject at the international level. The Office of the Economic Advisor, Ministry of Commerce and Industry made the first attempt of compilation and release of IIP with base year 1937, covering 15 important industries, accounting for more than 90 percent of the total production of the selected industries. The all-India IIP is being released as a monthly series since 1950. With the inception of the Central Statistical Organization in 1951, the responsibility for compilation and publication of IIP was vested with this office.\n\nAs the structure of the industrial sector changes over time, it became necessary to revise the base year of the IIP periodically to capture the changing composition of industrial production and emergence of new products and services so as to measure the real growth of industrial sector (UNSO recommends quinquennial revision of the base year of IIP). After 1937, the successive revised base years were 1946, 1951, 1956, 1960, 1970, 1980–81 and 1993–94. Initially it was covering 15 industries comprising three broad categories: mining, manufacturing and electricity. The scope of the index was restricted to mining and manufacturing sectors consisting of 20 industries with 35 items, when the base year was shifted to 1946 by Economic Adviser, Ministry of Commerce & Industry and it was called Interim Index of Industrial Production. This index was discontinued in April 1956 due to certain shortcomings and was replaced by the revised index with 1951 as the base year covering 88 items, broadly categorised as mining & quarrying (2), manufacturing (17) and electricity (1) compiled by CSO. The items in this index were classified according to the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) 1948 of all economic activities.\n\nThe index was revised in July 1962 to the base year 1956 as per the recommendations of a working group constituted by the CSO for the purpose and it had covered 201 items, classified according to the Standard Industrial and Occupational Classification of All Economic Activities published by the CSO in 1962. The index with 1960 as the base year was based on regular monthly series for 312 items and annual series for 436 items. Hence, though the published index was based on regular monthly series for 312 items, weights had been assigned for 436 items with a view to using the same set of weights for the regular monthly index as well as the annual index covering the additional items. However, the mineral index prepared by the IBM excluded gold, salt, petroleum and natural gas.\n\nThe next revised series of index numbers with 1970 as the base year, had taken into account of the structural changes occurred in industrial activity of the country since 1960 and this index was released in March 1975 covering 352 items comprising mining (61), manufacturing (290) and electricity (1). The working group (set up in 1978) under the Chairmanship of the then Director General of CSO, decided to shift the base to 1980–81, to reflect the changes that had taken place in the industrial structure and to accommodate the items from small-scale sector.\n\nA notable feature of the revised 1980 index number series was the inclusion of 18 items from the SSI sector, for which the office of the Development Commissioner of Small-Scale Industries (DCSSI) could ensure regular supply of data. The production data for the small-scale sector were included only from the month of July 1984 onwards; prior to this the production data from the directorate general of technical development (DGTD) for large and medium industries alone had been utilised. For the period April 1981 to June 1984 in respect of these 18 items, average base year (1980–81) production as obtained from DGTD was utilized. From July 1984 onwards, combined average base year production both for DGTD and DCSSI products was utilised. The weights for these items were based on ASI 1980–1981 results and no separate weights for DGTD and DCSSI items were allocated in the 1980–81 series.\n\nThe next revision of IIP with 1993–94 as the base year containing 543 items (with the addition of 3 items for mining sector and 188 for the manufacturing sector) has come into existence on 27 May 1998 and ever since, the quick estimates of IIP are being released as per the norms set out for the IMF’s SDDS2, with a time lag of six weeks from the reference month. These quick estimates for a given month are revised twice in the subsequent months. To retain the distinctive character and enable the collection of data, the source agencies proposed clubbing of 478 items of the manufacturing sector into 285 item groups and thus making a total of 287 item groups together with one each of electricity and mining & quarrying. The revised series has followed the National Industrial Classification NIC-1987. Another important feature of the latest series is the inclusion of unorganised manufacturing sector (That is, the same 18 SSI products) along with organised sector for the first time in the weighting diagram.\n\nRecent revision of IIP released by CSO with 2004–05 as the base year comprises 682 items. As per chief statistician T C A Anant, this index shall give a better picture of growth in various sectors of the economy, because it is broader and includes technologically advanced goods such as cell phones and iPods. The previous base year (1993–94) was not usable as the list contained an array of outdated items such as typewriters and tape recorders.\n\nWeighted arithmetic mean of quantity relatives with weights being allotted to various items in proportion to value added by manufacture in the base year by using Laspeyres' formula:\n\nformula_1\n\nwhere I is the index, Ri is the production relative of the ith item for the month in question and Wi is the weight allotted to it.\n\n\n"}

He lived in Paris in the 1920s, as part of its famous expatriate American writers' circle, when he met his first wife, Josephine Herbst in 1924. Herbst enjoyed more success as a writer than Herrmann; the couple lived a few years in rural Pennsylvania, and were friends with Katherine Anne Porter, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, William Carlos Williams, and others.\n\nHerrmann's first novel, \"What Happens\", was original published in Paris by Robert McAlmon's Contact Editions press. Copies were seized by U.S. Customs upon their arrival in the United States on the charge of violating the 1922 Tariff Act, which banned the import of obscene materials from foreign countries. Herrmann fought the charge in a jury trial in New York City in October 1927 but ultimately lost. Despite supporters such as Genevieve Taggard, H.L. Mencken, and Katharine Anne Porter, the jury responded with a negative verdict, and the judge ordered the seized copies destroyed.\n\nAfter returning to Michigan in 1924, Herrmann wrote a manuscript about anti-German backlash during World War I but was unable to get it published. Researcher Sara Kosiba found the manuscript in the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin and arranged to have it published in 2018 under the title \"Foreign Born.\"\n\nIn 1932, Herrmann's short novel, \"The Big Short Trip,\" tied with Thomas Wolfe for the Scribner's Magazine short novel prize.\n\nIn 1934, he went to work with Harold Ware and his organization Farm Research, Inc., which worked with the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Herrmann soon was a part of the Ware group, a secret apparatus of the CPUSA and Comintern in Washington, D.C., which supplied classified information to Soviet intelligence. From early 1934 until the summer of 1935, Herrmann was a paid courier for the CPUSA, delivering material emanating from the secret cells of sympathetic government employees being cultivated by Hal Ware to New York City. Herrmann also was the person who introduced Whittaker Chambers to Alger Hiss.\n\nIn 1940, Herrmann divorced Herbst and married Ruth Tate.

Old timers referred to them as Konda Karáva another clan of the Karava similar to the Suriya clans Kurukulasuriya, Warnakulasuriya, Mihindukulasuriya, Bharathakulasuriya, Manukulasuriya, Arasakulasuriya and Kón Karávas. Konda came to mean hair in Sri Lanka only after the 15th century Kotte period. Prior to that hair was referred to in the Sinhala language as kes, varalasa, dhammilla or muhulasa.\n\nThe name Konda has been preserved to date in Sri Lankan Karava family names such as Vira Konda Árachchige, Vadana Konda Árachchige, Vira Konda Patabendige and other such names. The Kurukula Charithaya (part I 235) reproduces a copper sannasa given by King Vijayabahu, probably Vijayabahu VI, to a Konda Perumal at a time when Perumal denoted a prince. It also lists the Konda Kaurava family names: Konda Perumal Árachchigé from Koggala and Kuru Vira Kaundan, Periya Kondan, Sina Kondan, Sella Kondan, Vira Kondan, Kuru VIra Kondan, Kondagé, Vira Kondagé, Maha Kondagé, Punchi Kondagé and Sella Kondagé from other parts of Sri Lanka.\nThe prevalence of the name Konda in various parts of South India suggests that a significant group of Kondas of considerable importance lived in mediaeval South India. Similar to the other South Indian Kshatriya clans the Kondas too may have claimed descent ultimately from the Mahabharata Kauravas.\n\nThe name Konda had been widely used in the Pandya kingdom and the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa refers to Punkonda, Khuddakancha Kunda and Kanga Konda in connection with the 12th century Pandyan invasion by the General of Parákramabáhu the Great (Mahavamsa 76.94, 76.140, 76.171 & 76.184 ). Parantaka I, the Chola King who defeated the joint Sri Lankan and Pandyan armies had assumed the victory title Dorai Eelam Kondai on that account and therefore it appears that Kondai meant conqueror.\n\nChola Adithya’s victory over Kondai Mandalam shifted the balance of power between the Pallavas and Cholas and was the beginning of the Chola empire. The Pallavas and Cholas were Kshatriyas connected by intermarriage and both dynasties claimed connections to the Mahabharata kings. Konda has also been used in place names such as Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh and an inscription of the Sri Lankan King Sahasamalla states that he had spent two years in a place called Gangaikondapattana in India (EZ II 225). And, two South Indian inscriptions by a Pandyan ruler named Kónerimel Kondán say that he had a camp at Gangakondapattana (Annual report on South Indian Epigraphy 125 ). The name Gangai in the above two inscriptions from the Ramnad district of India; Chodaganga of the Mahavansa account of Sri Lanka’s Pandya invasion referred to above; the word Ganga in the names of Sri Lankan Rulers Chodaganga and Gangavasa Kalyanavati etc. point to the highly interconnected nature of mediaeval royal families in India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Kudumirissa inscription of Sri Lanka refers to a clan known as Kaundinya gothra and the Galgané copper sannasa refers to Parákramabáhu sámi’s ancestry as “ Sakala dig vijayavaliya ransa Konda Parákramabáhu piriven sámi\". Ulakkonda is a village in Gangapalatha, Udunuvara and Muthukeliyáva a hilly site in Ulakkonda, far removed from the pearl producing coast, brings to mind the mutukuda (pearl umbrellas) and other insignia of the Karavas. Maluvawatta lies to the east of Ulakkonda and nearby is an ancient Bo tree with a legend that it was planted by a Brahmin in ancient times. As such Ulakkonda may well have been an abode of Konda nobles in the past (Sahithya 72).\n\nTwo Kaurálas in a village named Kondagama in Tumpané, have signed a deed in AD 1761 as witnesses (Gazetteer I 468), further documenting the Konda and Karáva linkage of the past. The Pattini cult in Sri Lankan history is associated with the Karavas brought back on king Gajabahu I’s Indian invasion, and as expected an old Pattini Devale is still there in the village known as Kondadeniya (Gazetteer II 528). The Rajavaliya narrates that a King named Edirimanasuriya ruled from a city in Sri Lanka known as Mundakondapola (Rajavaliya 234). Mundakondapola is situated 8 miles from Kurunegala on the Puttlam road, in the Hatara Korale, the old ‘Kuru country’ (parana Kuru Rata) of the Karavas.\n\nAn old Sinhala verse which sings the praise of a king from Murakondaya who was deified as Irual Bandára says that he was from the Suryawansa, the Kshatriya Solar dynasty (Ceylon the Portuguese Era I 142). A contemporary of this Edirimanasuriya was the Karava King of Jaffna, Ethirimanasingham (AD 1592 - 1615). Ethirimanasingham was a king of the Singhe Dynasty of Jaffna, from which the Karava families of Tisseveerasinghe, Puvirajasinghe, Puvimanasinghe and Philip descend (Singhe Dynasty of Jaffnapattanam 19). The Karava Patangatim Domingo Corea also known as Edirimanasuriya was appointed by king Dharmapala in the 16th century to rule this region. Therefore, King Edirimanasuriya of Mundakondapola too appears to have been a regional Karava King, a Konda Karáva, possibly from the Kshatriya Keerawella family of the Hatara Korale.\n\nAs such it appears that Konda in mediaeval India and Sri Lanka was a branch of the interrelated South Indian Kshatriya families which were spread in the Chola, Pandya and Pallava kingdoms and Sri Lanka. Over the centuries the Kondas have virtually been forgotten and traces of the Kondas remain only in a few place names and in Karáva family names.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "515958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=515958", "title": "Lezgins", "text": "Lezgins\n\nLezgins (, \"lezgiyar\", Russian: лезгины, \"lezginy\"; Azerbaijani: \"Ləzgilər\"; also called \"Lezgins\", \"Lezgi\", \"Lezgis\", \"Lezgs\", \"Lezgin\") are a Northeast Caucasian ethnic group native predominantly to southern Dagestan and northeastern Azerbaijan and who speak the Lezgian language.\n\nThe origin of the ethnonym \"Lezgin\" requires further research. Nevertheless, most researchers attribute the derivation of \"Lezgi\" to be from the ancient \"Legi\" and early medieval \"Lakzi\".\n\nModern-day Lezgins speak Northeast Caucasian languages that have been spoken in the region before the introduction of Indo-European languages. They are closely related, both culturally and linguistically, to the Aghuls of southern Dagestan and, somewhat more distantly, to the Tsakhurs, Rutuls, and Tabasarans (the northern neighbors of the Lezgins). Also related, albeit more distantly, are the numerically small Jek, Kryts, Laks, Shahdagh, Budukh, and Khinalug peoples of northern Azerbaijan. These groups, together with the Lezgins, form the Samur branch of the indigenous Lezgic peoples.\n\nLezgins are believed to descend partly from people who inhabited the region of southern Dagestan in the Bronze Age. However, there is some DNA evidence of significant admixture during the last 4,000 years with a Central Asian population, as shown by genetic links to populations throughout Europe and Asia, with notable similarities to the Burusho people of Pakistan.\n\nPrior to the Russian Revolution, the Lezgins did not have a common self-designation as an ethnic group. They referred to themselves by village, region, religion, clan, or free society. Before the revolution, the Lezgins were called \"Kyurintsy\", \"Akhtintsy\", or \"Lezgintsy\" by the Russians. The ethnonym \"Lezgin\" itself is quite problematic. Prior to the Soviet period, the term \"Lezgin\" was used in different contexts. At times, it referred only to the people known today as Lezgins. At others, it referred variously to all of the peoples of southern Daghestan (Lezgin, Aghul, Rutul, Tabasaran, and Tsakhur); all of the peoples of southern Daghestan and northern Azerbaijan (Kryts Jek, Khinalug, Budukh, Shahdagh); all Nakh-Daghestani peoples; or all of the indigenous Muslim peoples of the Northeast Caucasian peoples (Caucasian Avars, Dargwa, Laks, Chechens, and Ingush). In reading pre-Revolutionary works, one must be aware of these different possible meanings and the scope of the ethnonym \"Lezgin\".\n\nIn the 4th century BC, the numerous tribes speaking Lezgic languages united in a union of 26 tribes, formed in the Eastern Caucasus state of Caucasian Albania, which itself was incorporated in the Persian Achaemenid Empire in 513 BC. Under the influence of initially Persian but also Parthian rule Caucasian Albania was divided into several areas - Lakzi, Shirvan, etc.\n\nThe Lezgic speaking tribes participated in the battle of Gaugamela under the Persian banner against the invading Alexander the Great.\n\nUnder Parthian rule, Iranian political and cultural influence increased in the whole region of their Caucasian Albanian province, therefore including where the Lezgic speaking tribes lived. Whatever the sporadic suzerainty of Rome of the region due to their wars with the Parthians, the country was now a part—together with Iberia (East Georgia) and (Caucasian) Albania, where other Arsacid branches reigned—of a pan-Arsacid family federation. Culturally, the predominance of Hellenism, as under the Artaxiads, was now followed by again a predominance of \"Iranianism\", and, symptomatically, instead of Greek, as before, Parthian became the language of the educated of the region. An incursion in this era was made by the Alans who between 134 and 136 attacked regions including where Lezgic tribes lived, but Vologases persuaded them to withdraw, probably by paying them.\n\nIn 252–253, rule over the Lezgic tribes changed from Parthian to Sassanid Persian. Caucasian Albania became a vassal state, now of the Sassanids, but retained its monarchy; the Albanian king had no real power and most civil, religious, and military authority lay with the Sassanid marzban (military governor) of the territory.\n\nThe Roman Empire obtained control over some of the southernmost Lezgin regions for a few years around 300 AD, but then the Sassanid Persians regained control and subsequently dominated the area for centuries until the Arab invasions.\n\nAlthough Lezgins were first introduced to Islam perhaps as early as the 8th century, the Lezgins remained primarily animist until the 15th century, when Muslim influence became stronger, with Persian traders coming in from the south, and the Golden Horde increasingly pressing from the north. In the early 16th century, the Persian Safavids consolidated their control over large parts of Dagestan for centuries onwards. As a result of the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590, the Ottomans managed to wrest control of the region for a short period of time, until it was regained by the Safavids under king Abbas I (r. 1588-1629).\n\nA notable Lezgin from the Safavid Iranian era was Fath-Ali Khan Daghestani, who served as Safavid \"grand vizier\" from 1716 to 1720, during the reign of king (\"shah\") Sultan Husayn (1694–1722). By the early course of the 18th century, the Safavid Empire was in a state of heavy decline. In 1721, the Lezgins sacked and looted the city of Shamakhi, the provincial capital of Shirvan. The Lak Kazi Kumukh Khanate controlled a part of the Lezgins for a time in the 18th century after the disintegration of the Safavid Empire\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, Persia was able to restore its full authority throughout the entire Caucasus under Nader Shah. After the death of Nader, he created the state into divided several smaller khanates. Some Lezgins were part of the Kuba Khanate in what is now Azerbaijan, while others fell under the jurisdiction of the Derbent Khanate. The main part of Lezgins united in \"free society\" (Magalim) (Akhty para, Alti-para, Kure, Dokuz-para).\nIn 1813, as a result of the Treaty of Gulistan, the Russians gained control over southern Dagestan and most of what is the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other area's where the Lezgins lived and removed Iran from the military equation. The Russian administration subsequently created the Kiurin Khanate, later to become the Kiurin district.\nMany Lezgins in Dagestan, however, participated in the Great Caucasian War that started roughly during the same time the Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century were happening, and fought against the Russians alongside the Avar Imam Shamil, who for 25 years (1834–1859) defied Russian rule. It was not until after his defeat in 1859 that the Russians consolidated their rule over Dagestan and the Lezgins.\n\nIn 1930, Sheikh Mohammed Effendi Shtulskim organized an uprising against Soviet rule, which was suppressed after several months. In the 20th century, attempts were made to create a republic of Lezgistan (independent or as an autonomous region).\n\nSome Lezgins were deported to Central Asia in the 1940s by Stalin's regime.\n\nPrior to the Russian Revolution, \"Lezgin\" was a term applied to all ethnic groups inhabiting the present-day Russian Republic of Dagestan. In the 19th century, the term was used more broadly for all ethnic groups speaking non-Nakh Northeast Caucasian languages, including Caucasian Avars, Laks, and many others (although the Vainakh peoples, who were Northeast Caucasian language speakers were referred to as \"Circassians\").\n\nWhile ancient Greek historians, including Herodotus, Strabo, and Pliny the Elder, referred to \"Legoi\" people who inhabited Caucasian Albania, Arab historians of the 9th and 10th centuries mention the kingdom of Lakz in present-day southern Dagestan. Al Masoudi referred to inhabitants of this area as Lakzams (Lezgins), who defended Shirvan against invaders from the north. The Lezgin ethnic group probably resulted from a merger of the Akhty, the Alty and Dokus Para federations, and some clans from among the Rutuls.\n\nThe Lezgins inhabit a compact territory that straddles the border area of southern Daghestan and northern Azerbaijan. It lies, for the most part, in the southeastern portion of Daghestan in (Akhtynsky District, Dokuzparinsky District, Suleyman-Stalsky District, Kurakhsky District, Magaramkentsky District, Khivsky District, Derbentsky District and Rutulsky District) and contiguous northeastern Azerbaijan (in Kuba, Qusar, Qakh, Khachmaz, Oguz, Qabala, Nukha, and Ismailli districts).\n\nThe Lezgin territories are divided into two physiographic zones: a region of high, rugged mountains and the piedmont (foothills). Most of the Lezgin territory is in the mountainous zone, where a number of peaks (like Baba Dagh) reach over 3,500 meters in elevation. There are deep and isolated canyons and gorges formed by the tributaries of the Samur and Gulgeri Chai rivers. In the mountainous zones the summers are very hot and dry, with drought conditions a constant threat. There are few trees in this region aside from those in the deep canyons and along the streams themselves. Drought-resistant shrubs and weeds dominate the natural flora. The winters here are frequently windy and brutally cold. In this zone the Lezgins engaged primarily in animal husbandry (mostly sheep and goats) and in craft industries.\n\nIn the extreme east of the Lezgin territory, where the mountains give way to the narrow coastal plain of the Caspian Sea, and to the far south, in Azerbaijan, are the foothills. This region has relatively mild, very dry winters and hot, dry summers. Trees are few here also. In this region animal husbandry and artisanry were supplemented by some agriculture (along the alluvial deposits near the rivers).\n\nThe material culture significantly influence Azerbaijan, especially Lezgins living in Azerbaijan. The folk songs a central place belongs to the lyrical songs of the dance character with vivid instrumental sections; instrumental music itself is full melizmatika. Folk art is also presented dances, among which, in particular, the famous \"Lezginka\", common among the peoples of the Caucasus. There are more calm male dance Zarb makam as well as slow-flowing dances Akhty tea Perizat Khanum Useynel, Bahtavar.\n\nFirst Lezgin theater originated in 1906 in the village of Akhty. In 1935, based on the semi-professional team was created Lezgin State Music and Drama Theatre named after S. Stalsky. In 1998, the State Lezgin theater was opened in Azerbaijan, located in Qusar.\n\nThe Lezgian language belongs to the Lezgic branch of the Northeast Caucasian language family (with Aghul, Rutul, Tsakhur, Tabasaran, Budukh, Khinalug, Jek, Khaput, Kryts, and Udi).\n\nThe Lezgian language has three closely related (mutually intelligible) dialects: Kurin (also referred to as Gunei or Kurakh), Akhti, and Kuba. The Kurin dialect is the most widespread of the three and is spoken throughout most of the Lezgin territories in Daghestan, including the town of Kurakh, which, historically, was the most important cultural, political, and economic center in the Lezgin territory in Daghestan and is the former seat of the khanate of Kurin. The Akhti dialect is spoken in southeastern Daghestan. The Kuba dialect, the most Turkicized of the three, is widespread among the Lezgins of northern Azerbaijan (named for the town of Kuba, the cultural and economical focus of the region).\n\nToday, the Lezgins are predominantly Sunni Muslims, with a Shia minority living in Miskindja village in Dagestan.\nThe main type of settlement in Lezghins - the village (\"hur\"). With regard to social groups Lezgin village, it is divided into quarters. Distributed large geographically-related settlement (one quarter - one tukhum). Each village had a mosque, rural area - Kim, a gathering of residents (male part) at the village assembly to address the most important issues of public life of the village.\n\nLezgian dance — Lezgi solo male and pair dance, common among many peoples of the Caucasus.\nThe dance uses a 2 image. The man moves in the way \"eagle\", alternates between a slow and rapid pace. The most spectacular movements are dance movements of men, when he is on his toes, throwing his hands in different directions. The woman moves in the form of \"Swan\", bewitching graceful posture and smooth hand movements. The woman increases the tempo of his dance after the man. Not surprisingly, the dance, common among all the Caucasian peoples, was named in accordance with the ancient totem of the Lezgins: the word \"Lek\" () means eagle.\n\nLezgins live mainly in the Republic of Azerbaijan and in the Russian Federation (Dagestan). The total population is believed to be around 700,000, with 474,000 living in Russia. In Azerbaijan, the government census counts 180,300. However, Lezgin national organizations mention 600,000 to 900,000, the disparity being that many Lezgins claim Azeri nationality to escape job and education discrimination in Azerbaijan. Despite the assimilationist policy of the Azeri government, the Lezgin population is undoubtedly greater than it appears.\n\nAs Svante Cornell adds;\n\nLezgins also live in Central Asia, mainly due to Stalin's deportation policies.\n\nLezgins are, \"generally speaking\", well integrated into the society of Azerbaijan. Mixed marriages are furthermore common. Lastly, Lezgins in Azerbaijan have a better level of education compared to their kin in Dagestan.\n\nIn 1992 a Lezgin organization named Sadval was established to promote Lezgin rights. Sadval campaigned for the redrawing of the Russian–Azerbaijani border to allow for the creation of a single Lezgin state encompassing areas in Russia and Azerbaijan where Lezgins were compactly settled. In Azerbaijan a more moderate organization called Samur was formed, advocating more cultural autonomy for Lezgins in Azerbaijan.\n\nLezgins traditionally suffered from unemployment and a shortage of land. A major consequence of the outbreak of the war in Chechnya in 1994 was the closure of the border between Russia and Azerbaijan: as a result the Lezgins were for the first time in their history separated by an international border restricting their movement.\n\nThe high tide of Lezgin mobilization in Azerbaijan appeared to have passed towards the end of the 1990s. Sadval was banned by the Azerbaijani authorities after official allegations that it was involved in a bombing of the Baku underground. The end of the Karabakh war, and Lezgin resistance to forced conscription, deprived the movement of a key issue on which to mobilize. In 1998 Sadval split into ‘moderate’ and ‘radical’ wings, following which it appeared to lose much of its popularity on both sides of the Russian–Azerbaijani border.\n\nHowever, Azerbaijani–Lezgin relations continued to be complicated by claims that Islamic fundamentalism enjoyed disproportionate popularity among Lezgins. In July 2000 Azerbaijani security forces arrested members of Lezgin and Avar ethnicity of a group named the Warriors of Islam, which allegedly was planning an insurgency against the Azerbaijani state.\n\nLezgins expressed concern over underrepresentation in the Azerbaijani Parliament (Milli Meclis) after a shift away from proportional representation in the parliamentary elections of November 2005. Lezgins had been represented by two members of parliament in the previous parliament, but are now represented by only one.\n\nLezgin is taught as a foreign language in areas where many Lezgins are settled, but teaching resources are scarce. Lezgin textbooks come from Russia and are not adapted to local conditions. Although Lezgin newspapers are available, Lezgins have also expressed concern over the disappearance of their rich oral tradition. The only Lezgin television broadcasting available in Azerbaijan is that received over the border from Russia.\n\nIn March 2006 Azerbaijani media reported that Sadval had formed an 'underground' terrorist unit carrying out operations in Dagestan. Security forces across the border in Dagestan in Russia, responded sceptically to these reports.\n\nAccording to reports Lezgins in Dagestan suffer disproportionately from unemployment, with unemployment rates in Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan twice the republican average of 32 per cent. This may be one contributory factor to renewed calls from within the Sadval movement in January 2006 for a redrawing of the Russian-Azerbaijani border to incorporate Lezgin-populated areas of southern Dagestan within Azerbaijan.\n\nIn March 1999 another organization, the Federal Lezgin National Cultural Autonomy, was established as an extraterritorial movement advocating cultural autonomy for Lezgins.\n\n\n"}

She was best known for her murals and for her association with the Mexican artist Diego Rivera, for whom she produced the only existing photographs of Rivera's mural \"Man at the Crossroads\", painted in 1933 and destroyed in January 1934 at Rockefeller Center in New York City.\n\nBloch was born in Geneva, Switzerland, the youngest child of composer and photographer Ernest Bloch.\n\nA multi-talented artist, Lucienne attended the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris at 14, apprenticing with sculptor Antoine Bourdelle and painter Andre Lhote. Her close friend Beniamino Bufano also influenced her sculpture.\n\nIn 1917, the Bloch family emigrated to America.\n\nIn 1929, she pioneered the design of glass sculpture for the Royal Leerdam Crystal Glass Factory in the Netherlands. When Frank Lloyd Wright saw her glass works and spoke with her in New York, he invited her to teach at his architectural school, Taliesin East, where she worked with artist and muralist Santiago Martínez Delgado and other Taliesin fellows.\n\nThen, in 1931, Bloch had met and began her apprenticeship with Diego Rivera on his frescoes in New York (1931, 1933) and Detroit (1932). She also formed a close friendship with Rivera's wife Frida Kahlo, and they became each other's companion and confidant. In 1932 she accompanied Kahlo to Mexico when Kahlo's mother became ill. She was also with Kahlo in Detroit when Kahlo had her miscarriage.\nA prolific photographer, Bloch contributed many photographs of Rivera and Kahlo to biographical works about them. She took the only existing photographs of Rivera's (controversially) destroyed mural, \"Man at the Crossroads\", in Rockefeller Center Plaza in New York City. She created five portfolios of photographs of Rivera and Kahlo, including photos of Kahlo's paintings in progress, and the artists in New York City, Detroit, and Mexico. The apprentices there were: Bloch, Stephen Pope Dimitroff, Lou Block, Arthur Niendorf, Seymour Fogel, Hideo Noda, and Antonio Sanchez Flores.\n\nOn September 5, 1935, Lucienne married Stephen Pope Dimitroff, one of Rivera's chief plasterers. Together they created fresco murals all over the United States.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1939, Bloch was employed by the WPA/FAP (Works Progress Administration/Federal Arts Project). As a WPA/FAP artist, she completed murals for public buildings, including the House of Detention for Women in New York City, and the Fort Thomas, Kentucky post office. She also worked free-lance as a photographer for \"Life\" magazine. For \"Life\" she record the desperate conditions of autoworkers during labor strikes and protests that occurred throughout the U.S. during the formation of automobile worker unions.\n\nShe and Dimitroff created nearly 50 murals across the United States for religious institutions, schools, hospitals, and businesses. Dimitroff died in 1996 on their farm in Gualala, California.\n\nBloch worked in many types of media: photography, fresco, woodblock cuts, lithographs, mosaics, egg tempera, watercolor, wood and glass sculpture, terra cotta, portraits in ink, gesso, and oil.\n\nShe also illustrated numerous children's books, of which the Library of Congress lists:\n\nBloch married Dimitroff in 1935 in Flint, Michigan.\n\nThey had three children; George Ernest Dimitroff, born July 22, 1938, Pencho Bloch Dimitroff, born August 3, 1941, and Sita Dimitroff (Milchev) born December 25, 1943.\n\nDimitroff died in 1996, and was followed by Bloch in 1999; both died on their small farm in Gualala in Northern California.\n\nOne grandchild, her namesake, Lucienne Allen, maintains her legacy from the family farm, \"Old Stage Studios,\" in Gualala. www.LucienneBloch.com\n\n"}
{"id": "2771856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2771856", "title": "Luo people (Kenya)", "text": "Luo people (Kenya)\n\nThe Luo (also called Joluo or Jonagi/Onagi, singular Jaluo, Jaonagi or Joramogi/Nyikwaramogi, meaning \"Ramogi's heirs\") are an ethnic group in western Kenya, northern Uganda, and in Mara Region in northern Tanzania. They are part of a larger group of ethno-linguistically related Luo peoples who inhabit an area ranging from South Sudan, South-Western Ethiopia, Northern and Eastern Uganda, South-Western Kenya and North-Eastern Tanzania.\n\nThe Luo are the fourth largest ethnic group (11%) in Kenya, after the Kikuyu (18%), the Luhya (14%) and the Kalenjin (12%). The Luo and the Kikuyu inherited the bulk of political power in the first years following Kenya's independence in 1963. The Luo population in Kenya was estimated to be 2,185,000 in 1994 and 3.4 million in 2010 according to Government census. However the figure was disputed by many Luos as not scientific since a significant portion of people previously considered as Luo were now counted as Suba people (of Kenya and Tanzania). The Subas eventually numbered 300,000 but most are completely assimilated Luos by culture, name, language and political orientation and have more or less the same outlook of life. This is a result of heavy intermarriage and interaction. The Luos also feel that their overall population has always been downscaled by successive Kenyan regime census in an attempt to mute the strong Luo political voice. Sample census conducted by experts estimate the total Kenyan Luo population to be currently at around 5 million. The Tanzanian Luo population was estimated at 1.1 million in 2001 and 1.9 million in 2010.\n\nThe main Luo livelihoods are fishing, farming and pastoral herding. Outside Luoland, the Luo comprise a significant fraction of East Africa's intellectual and skilled labour force in various professions. Others members work in eastern Africa as tenant fishermen, small-scale farmers, and urban workers.\n\nThey speak the Dholuo language, which belongs to the Western Nilotic branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family spoken by other Luo-speaking peoples, such as the Lango, Acholi, Adhola and Alur (all of Uganda and parts of South Sudan and Eastern Congo). The four waves of Luo migration were chiefly from the four Luo-speaking groups (Lwoo), especially Acholi and Padhola. Dholuo, spoken in Kenya, is considered to be proper and standard Luo because it contains elements from all other Lwoo languages. It is estimated that Dholuo has 90% lexical similarity with Lep Alur (Alur language); 83% with Lep Achol (Acholi language); 81% with Lango language, 93% with Dhopadhola (Padhola language), 74% with Anuak, and 69% with Jurchol (Luwo) and Dhi-Pari (Pari).\n\nThe Luo are the originators of a number of music styles, such as Benga, Ohangla, Dodo, Nyatiti, Orutu and Otenga.\n\nThe Luo of Kenya and Tanzania, even though related to other Luo groups linguistically, are classified as the only 'river lake Nilotes' having migrated and lived along the Nile river. They are indigenous to the Nile Valley and have been for thousands of years. Their cradle of civilization was the city-state of Napata or present-day Karima, Sudan in the 'Koch' kingdom (Kush kingdom).\nArguably the first inhabitants of Sudan, they entered Kenya and Tanzania via Uganda from the Bahr al Gazzal or Bahr el-Ghazal region. The Luo were the founders of the Shilluk kingdom and descendants of the ancient Egyptians who were directly linked to the Kingdom of Shilluk. In the land of Shilluk, the Luo clans of Kenya and Tanzania were called 'Ororo', while among the Dinka and Nuer they were called 'Liel'. \n\nThe present-day Kenya Luo traditionally consist of 27 tribes, each in turn composed of various clans and sub-clans (\"Jo-\" indicates \"people of\").\n\nEarly British contact with the Luo was indirect and sporadic. Relations intensified only when the completion of the Uganda Railway had confirmed British intentions and largely removed the need for local alliances. In 1896 a punitive expedition was mounted in support of the Wanga ruler Mumia in Ugenya against the Umira Kager clan led by Gero. Over 200 were quickly killed by a Maxim gun. 300 people in Uyoma resistance were killed by an expedition led by Sir Charles Horbley (Bwana Obila Muruayi) when they were confiscating Luo cattle to help feed the Coolies who were building the Uganda railway.\n\nBy 1900, the Luo chief Odera was providing 1,500 porters for a British expedition against the Nandi.\n\nIn 1915, the Colonial Government sent \"Odera Akang'o\", the \"ruoth\" of Gem, to Kampala, Uganda. He was impressed by the British settlement there and upon his return home he initiated a forced process of adopting western styles of \"schooling, dress and hygiene\". This resulted in the rapid education of the Luo in the English language and English ways.\n\nThe Luo generally were not dispossessed of their land by the British, avoiding the fate that befell the pastoral ethnic groups inhabiting the Kenyan \"White Highlands\". Many Luo played significant roles in the struggle for Kenyan independence, but the people were relatively uninvolved in the Mau Mau Uprising of the 1950s. Instead, some Luo used their education to advance the cause of independence peacefully. The lawyer C.M.G. Argwings-Kodhek, for example, used his expertise to defend Mau Mau suspects in court, although they had attacked not only whites, but also the men of other ethnic groups.\n\nKenya became independent on 12 December 1963, prominent Luo leader, Oginga Odinga, declined the presidency of Kenya, preferring to assume the vice presidency with Jomo Kenyatta as the head of government. Their administration represented the Kenya African National Union (KANU) party. However, differences with Jomo Kenyatta caused Oginga to defect from the party and abandon the vice presidency in 1966. His departure caused the Luo to become politically marginalized under the Kenyatta and subsequently the Moi administrations.\n\nIn Tanzania, Mwalimu J.K. Nyerere had personally sought to work with Hellon Ang'iela Owino of Shirati, Tanzania, as a trusted and vibrant political aide who was never ashamed of eloquently speaking his mind whenever needed. Mr. Owino was well known among the front bench politicians who exchanged fists with the then Oscar Kambona and Bhoke Munanka, whom he claimed were betraying Nyerere behind his agreed official prayers. Owino (1930s - 1988) was frequently sent many times by Nyerere (through Jaramogi Oginga A. Odinga) to mend relations with Kenya and was in particular the one who passed information (from Oginga, who was his African strategic security hub so as to calm down their badly torn relations caused by the Mau Mau war.\n\nMany years of marginalization and disastrous economic management in Kenya, particularly under the KANU party's administration of the nascent state, had tragic consequences for the people of Kenya. despite the economic potential of nearby Lake Victoria. Kenya continues to struggle with poverty and AIDS today.\n\nMore than 1,000 people were killed in Kenya's election violence amongst the Kikuyu, Luo, and several other ethnic groups following the controversial December 2007 presidential election.\n\nThe most prominent Luo politician today is Raila Odinga, the son of Oginga Odinga and former Prime Minister of the republic of Kenya. He is widely credited with enabling Mwai Kibaki to win the 2002 presidential election through the support of his Liberal Democratic Party. Other prominent politicians include James Orengo, Professor Anyang' Nyong'o whose daughter Lupita Nyong'o is a prominent Hollywood actress who has won the coveted Academy Awards and BET Awards, Peter Oloo-Aringo, Dalmas Otieno, Peter Ombija amongst others. Dr. PLO Lumumba who is the former Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission director is also a Luo. Prominent Luo doctors and scientists include the late Prof. David Peter Simon Wasawo, The first science professor in East and Central Africa and the first black East African to study and lecture science courses at Makerere university, Renown philosopher- Prof. Henry Odera OrukaDr. Joseph Aluoch a chest physician, Professor Walter Jaoko, a Tropical Diseases Specialist and leading HIV researcher, Professor George Magoha, a consultant urologist and former Vice-Chancellor of University of Nairobi, Dr. Job Bodo, an orthopeadic surgeon, Brian Jaoko Odongo, a prominent environmental scientist, Prof Sam Odingo, who received the 2007 Nobel peace prize along with Al Gore of the USA for their work in climate change among others.\n\nAnother prominent member was Barack Obama Sr., whose son, Barack Obama II, was the 44th President of the United States.\n\nTraditionally the Luos practiced the removal of six lower teeth. The practise has fallen largely out of use with the evolution of Luo culture.\n\nOne of their favourite meals includes fish(rech) especially tilapia(ngege) and omena, usually accompanied with ugali (called \"kuon\" in Dholuo) and traditional vegetables like osuga. Many of the vegetables eaten by the Luo were shared after years of association with their Bantu neighbours, the Abaluhya and the Abagusii. Traditional Luo diet consisted of kuon made of sorghum or millet accompanied by fish, meat, or vegetable stews.\n\nLike many ethnic communities in Uganda, including the Langi, Acholi, and Alur, the Luo do not practice the ritual circumcision of males as initiation.\n\nIn 1907, Johanna Owalo formed the first African independent church in Kenya called \"Nomiya\" or \"the mission I was given\". Nomiya church is a mixture of Christian, Islam and traditional African religious doctrines. The church practices \"circumcision\" for male children at the age of 8 days and they pray facing north. The church currently has a following of 800,000 in the Nyanza region. Other local churches include \"Legio Maria, Roho\" and \"Fweny\" among others.\n\nHistorically, couples were introduced to each other by matchmakers, but this is not common now. Like many other communities in Kenya, marriage practices among the Luo have been changing and some people are moving away from the traditional way of doing things. The Luo frequently marry outside their ethnic group. The traditional marriage ceremony takes place in two parts, both involving the payment of a bride price by the groom. The first ceremony, the Ayie, involves a payment of money to the mother of the bride; the second stage involves giving cattle to her father. Often these two steps are carried out at the same time, and, as many modern Luos are Christians, a church ceremony often follows.\n\nTraditionally, music was the most widely practiced art in the Luo community. At any time of day or night, music would be made. Music was not played for its own sake. Music was functional, being used for ceremonial, religious, political, or incidental purposes. Music was performed during funerals (\"Tero buru\"), to praise the departed, to console the bereaved, to keep people awake at night, and to express pain and agony. It was also used during cleansing and chasing away of spirits. Music was also played during ceremonies like beer parties (\"Dudu, ohangla dance\"), welcoming back the warriors from a war, during a wrestling match (\"Olengo\"), during courtship, etc. Work songs also existed. These were performed both during communal work like building, weeding, etc. and individual work like pounding of cereals, or winnowing. Music was also used for ritual purposes like chasing away evil spirits \"(nyawawa)\", who visit the village at night, in rain making, and during divination and healing.\n\nThe Luo music was shaped by the total way of life, lifestyles, and life patterns of individuals of this community. Because of that, the music had characteristics which distinguished it from that of other communities. This can be seen, heard, and felt in their melodies, rhythms, mode of presentation and dancing styles, movements, and formations.\n\nThe melodies in Luo music were lyrical, with a lot of vocal ornamentations. These ornaments came out clearly, especially when the music carried an important message. Their rhythms were characterized by a lot of syncopation and acrusic beginning. These songs were usually presented in solo-response style, although some were solo performances. The most common forms of solo performances were chants. These chants were recitatives with irregular rhythms and phrases, which carried serious messages. Most of the Luo dances were introduced by these chants. One example is the dudu dance.\n\nAnother unique characteristic in the Luo music is the introduction of yet another chant at the middle of a musical performance. The singing stops, the pitch of the musical instruments go down and the dance becomes less vigorous as an individual takes up the performance is self-praise. This is referred to as Pakruok. There was also a unique kind of ululation, Sigalagala, that marked the climax of the musical performance. Sigalagala was mainly done by women.\n\nThe dance styles in the Luo folk music were elegant and graceful. They involved either the movement of one leg in the opposite direction with the waist in step with the syncopated beats of the music or the shaking of the shoulders vigorously, usually to the tune of the nyatiti, an eight-stringed instrument.\n\nAdamson (1967) commented that Luos clad in their traditional costumes and ornaments deserve their reputation as the most picturesque people in Kenya. During most of their performances, the Luo wore costumes and decorated themselves not only to appear beautiful, but also to enhance their movements. These costumes included sisal skirts (owalo), beads (Ombulu / tigo) worn around the neck and waist, and red or white clay worn by the ladies. The men's costumes included kuodi or chieno, a skin worn from the shoulders or from the waist respectively to cover their nakedness, Ligisa, the headgear, shield and spear, reed hats, and clubs, among others. All these costumes and ornaments were made from locally available materials.\n\nThe Luo were also rich in musical instruments which ranged from percussion (drums, clappers, metal rings, ongeng'o or gara, shakers), strings (e.g., nyatiti, a type of lyre; orutu, a type of fiddle), wind (tung (instrument)|tung' a horn,Asili, a flute, A bu-!, to a specific type of trumpet).\n\nCurrently the Luo are associated with the \"benga\" style of music. It is a lively style in which songs in Dholuo, Swahili, or English are sung to a lively guitar riff. It originated in the 1950s with Luo musicians trying to adapt their traditional dance rhythms to western instruments. The guitar (acoustic, later electric) replaced the nyatiti as the string instrument. \"Benga\" has become so popular that it is played by musicians of all ethnicities and is no longer considered a purely Luo style. It has become Kenya's characteristic pop sound.\n\nLuo singer and nyatiti player Ayub Ogada received widespread exposure in 2005 when two of his songs were featured in Alberto Iglesias' Academy Award-nominated score for Fernando Mereilles' film adaptation of \"The Constant Gardener\".\n\nOther Luo musical greats in various genres are\nSuzanna Owiyo, Daniel Owino Misiani,Thomas Wasonga, Amolo Kong'o, Ouma Omore Ogwang' Lelo, Ogoya Nengo, Olith Ratego, Hellen-Akoth Mtawali, Achieng' Abura, Iddi Achieng', Hellon, Dan Chizi Aceda, Ricky Oyaro, JuaCali, Radikol - Kevin Okullo, Big Pin, George Ramogi, Collella Mazee, Musa Juma, John Junior, Osogo Winyo, Tony Nyadundo, Jack Nyadundo, Nina Ogot, Steve Nyabwa, Osito Kalle, Odongo Mayaka, Poxy Presha, Shirati Jazz band, Dolla Kabarry, Ochieng' Kabaselleh, Limpopo International Band, Onyi Papa Jey, Sal Davies, Atomy Sifa, Omollo K'Odingo, ((Lady Maureen)), Isaac Gem, Pete Odera, Juma Toto and Gabriel Omolo (Omolo Gaby).\n\nIn a nutshell, musical styles with Luo origin or dominance are Benga, Ohangla, Dudu, Nyatiti, Otenga, Afro-Fusion, Afro-house, Afro-jazz, Kenyan Gospel, Genge etc.\nOcholla Ayayo writes in \"Traditional Ideology and Ethics among the southern Luo\":\n\n\"When the time of the inheritance comes the ideology of seniority is respected: the elder son receives the largest share, followed in the order of seniority. If it is the land to be divided, for instance, the land of the old grandfather's homestead, the senior son gets the middle piece, the second the land to the right hand side of the homestead, and the third son takes the land on the left hand side. After the father's death the senior son takes over the responsibilities of leadership. These groups when considered in terms of genealogy, are people of the same grandfather, and are known in Dholuo as Jokakwaro. They share sacrifices under the leadership of the senior brother. If the brother is dead the next brother in seniority takes the leadership of senior brother. The responsibility and prestige position of leadership is that it puts one into the primary position in harvesting, cultivation, as well as in eating specified parts of the animal killed, usually the best parts. It is the senior brother, who is leading in the group, who can first own the fishing boat. Since it is he who will be communicating with the ancestors of their father or grandfather, it is he who will conduct or lead the sacrifices of religiousity of the boat, as we have noted earlier. [...] The system of the allocation of land by the father while he is still alive is important since it will coincide with the system of inheritance of land. The principle of the division of the land in monogamous families is rather simple and straightforward. [...] The senior son takes the centre portion of all the land of the homestead up to and beyond the gate or to the buffer zone; the second son then has the remainder of the land to divide with the other brothers. If the land is divided among the elder sons after they are married, and take to live in their lands, it often happens that a youngest son remains in the village of the father to care for him in his old age. His inheritance is the last property, called Mondo and the remaining gardens of his mother. [...] In the case of a polygamous village, the land is divided along the same lines, except that within the village, the sons claim the area contiguous to the houses of their mother. Each wife and her children are regarded as if the group constituted was the son of a single woman.By that I mean the children of the senior wife, Mikayi, are given that portion of the total area which could have been given to the senior son in a monogamous family. The sons of Nyachira, the second wife, and the sons of Reru, the third wife, lay claim to those portions which would have fallen to the second and third sons of Mikayi in a monogamous village\".\n\nPaul Hebinck and Nelson Mango explain in detail the family and inheritance system of the Luo in their article \"Land and embedded rights: An analysis of land conflicts in Luoland, Western Kenya.\" Parker MacDonald Shipton also writes extensively about kinship, family and inheritance among the Luo in his book \"Mortgaging the Ancestors: Ideologies of Attachment in Africa\":\n\n\"Outside the homestead enclosure, or (where there is no more enclosure) beyond and before its houses, Luo people have favored a layout of fields that in some ways reflects placements of houses within. The following pattern, as described in Gordon Wilson’s work from the 1950s, is still discernable in our times—not just in informants’ sketches of their ideals, but also in the allocations of real lands where space has allowed following suit. If there is more than one son in a monogamous homestead, the eldest takes land in front of or to the right of the entrance, and the second son takes land on the left. The third receives land to the right and center again, but farther from the father’s homestead. The fourth son, if there is one, goes to the left but farther from the paternal homestead than the second. Further sons alternate right and left. While elder sons might thus receive larger shares than the younger ones, the youngest takes over the personal garden (mondo) kept by the father for his own use—as if as a consolation prize\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33213818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33213818", "title": "Mamprusi language", "text": "Mamprusi language\n\nMamprusi (autonym \"Mampruli,\" also \"Mampelle, Ŋmampulli)\" is a Gur language spoken in northern Ghana by the Mamprusi people. It is partially mutually intelligible with Dagbani. The Mamprusi language is spoken in a broad belt across the northern parts of the Northern Region of Ghana, stretching west to east from Yizeesi to Nakpanduri and centred on the towns of Gambaga/Nalerigu and Walewale. In Mamprusi, one speaker is a \"Ŋmampuriga\", many (plural) are \"Ŋmampurisi\" and the land of the Mamprusi is \"Ŋmampurigu\".\n\nThe language belongs to the Gur family which is part of the Niger–Congo language family, which covers most of Sub-Saharan Africa (Bendor-Samuel 1989). Within Gur it belongs to the Western Oti–Volta subgroup, and particularly its southeastern cluster of six to eight languages (Naden 1988, 1989). Closely related and very similar languages spoken nearby are Dagbani, Nanun, Kamara and Hanga in the Northern Region, and Kusaal, Nabit and Talni in the Upper East Region. Not quite so closely related are Farefare, Waali, Dagaari, Birifor and Safalaba in the Upper East and Upper West Regions and southwest of the Northern Region.\n\nComparatively little linguistic material on the language has been published; there is a brief sketch as an illustration of this subgroup of languages in Naden 1988. A collection of Mampruli proverbs has been published by R.P. Xavier Plissart, and a translation of the New Testament is in print, a sample of which can be read and heard online. There are also beginning Mampruli lessons in which the spoken language can be heard.\n\nThere is comparatively little dialect variation. The western (Walewale to the White Volta) and Far Western (west of the White Volta, area known by those to the east as \"Overseas\") have some variant pronunciation standards. The far Eastern dialect known as Durili is most notable for pronouncing \"[r]\" and \"[l]\" where the rest of Mampruli pronounces \"[l]\" and \"[r]\" respectively, and for some characteristic intonation patterns.\n\nMampruli has ten phonemic vowels: five short and five long vowels:\n\nMampruli is written in a Latin alphabet, but the literacy rate is fairly low. The orthography currently used represents a number of allophonic distinctions. There is a description of the process of formulating the orthography.\n\nMampruli has a fairly conservative Oti-Volta grammatical system. The constituent order in Mampruli sentences is usually agent–verb–object. There is a simple, non-technical grammatical study «to be expanded»\n\nThe rather unusual trilingual (Mampruli-Spanish-English) dictionary was superseded by the more-reliable simple glossary: a full-featured Mampruli dictionary is in course of preparation. A hundred-word sample can be seen on the Kamusi project site\n"}
{"id": "42655857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42655857", "title": "Media portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis", "text": "Media portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis\n\nMedia portrayals of the Ukrainian crisis, including 2014 unrest and the 2014 Ukrainian revolution following the Euromaidan movement, differed widely between Ukrainian, western and Russian media. The Russian, the Ukrainian, and the Western media were all, to various degrees, accused of propagandizing, and of waging an information war during their coverage of the events. Russian channels were repeatedly criticized for the use of misleading images, false narratives, misrepresentation, suppression, and fabricated news stories, such as a child's crucifixion and the death of a 10-year-old in shelling. The BBC reported that Russian state television \"appears to employ techniques of psychological conditioning designed to excite extreme emotions of aggression and hatred in the viewer\", which, according to The Guardian, is part of a coordinated \"informational-psychological war operation\".\n\nA regular theme in the Russian media was that the Ukrainian army, which has many Russian-speaking members, was committing \"genocide\" against Russian-speakers and that they strongly desired Russia to \"protect\" them against Kiev. This presentation contradicted a poll showing that less than 20% of eastern residents wanted Russia's protection. They supported Russia's denials of involvement in the Crimean crisis, until Vladimir Putin boasted about the key role of Russian soldiers, and continue denying its involvement in the war in Donbass, despite evidence that Russia regularly shelled across the border.\n\nThe Russian media consistently portrayed the crisis in Ukraine as having been instigated by the post-Yanukovych Ukrainian government, and represented Euromaidan as being controlled by \"ultranationalist\", \"fascist\", \"neo-Nazi\", and \"anti-Semitic\" groups, with Right Sector a common theme. The revolution was depicted as a violent \"coup d'etat\" fomented by the West in order to overthrow an elected government. Police brutality against Euromaidan supporters was omitted. Portrayals by the Russia state media were generally close to those by the Russian government; they presented western countries, particularly the United States, as orchestrating events in Ukraine in order to harm Russia. Accusations of Russophobia were common in response to criticism of Russian actions. The Ukraine-European Union Association Agreement was depicted as a weapon against the Kremlin, protesters as paid stooges of the United States, and the Vilnius summit as akin to the Munich Agreement.\nIn addition to events in Ukraine, Russia has described other uprisings in eastern Europe which are unfavourable to the Kremlin's interests as being controlled by foreign powers and fascists. In a July 2009 open letter calling Russia \"a revisionist power\", Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, and other former leaders of central and eastern Europe criticised Russia for \"[challenging] our claims to our own historical experiences\" and \"[asserting] a privileged position in determining our security choices.\" Russian state television has described the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring of 1968, both stopped by Soviet-led invasions, as orchestrated by the United States and Western European countries. Russian TV presented the invasion of Czechoslovakia \"as brotherly help aimed to prevent an invasion by NATO and fascism\", provoking outrage in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nReporting on a Euromaidan protest attended by over a hundred thousand people, Channel One Russia said that the protests were \"dying out\" with \"only a few hundred\" attending. The head of \"Rossiya Segodnya\", Dmitry Kiselyov, said, \"Information war is now the main type of war, preparing the way for military action\" and the Russian Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu, described the media as an arm of the Russian military. Russian state media frequently reported stories that were completely made up or used distorted statements by Ukrainian and Western politicians. In 2015 European Union External Action started a periodic publication called \"Disinformation Review\" documenting such articles by Russian media accompanied by debunking information.\n\nNews published in even mainstream media and presented as actual events are frequently based on hearsay, anonymous blogs or intentionally staged shows, selectively quoted materials, usually skipping any opinions critical of Russia. Social media are also used in a coordinated way in an attempt to influence public opinion in Russia and other countries.\n\nFollowing the parliamentary vote in which Arseniy Yatsenyuk was chosen as transitional Prime Minister, \"RT\" described Ukrainian government officials as \"coup-appointed\". Continuing after the election of Petro Poroshenko as President, Russian news outlets regularly described the Ukrainian government as a \"junta, \"fascist\", and \"illegitimate\". Kiselyov's two-hour Sunday show \"Vesti Nedeli\" \"developed a near single-minded fixation on Ukraine\" and presented the post-Maidan authorities as \"fascist usurpers\" who were \"propped up\" by NATO. Ukraine was often portrayed as \"irreparably dysfunctional\", \"artificial\", \"deeply divided\", or as a failed state. Russian state media claimed that Kiev authorities had allowed total anarchy to take root in Ukraine and that the country was under the control of \"banderovtsy\", followers of Ukrainian nationalist Stepan Bandera. According to Boris Nemtsov's report, \"Putin. War\", the rhetoric of World War II was projected onto the crisis, with Russia presented as fighting against \"fascism\". Eastern Ukrainians were portrayed as desiring Russia's intervention and protection, despite a Gallup poll showing that less than 20% of residents held such views. The Ukrainian government was accused by Russian media of \"genocide\" and \"pogroms\" against the large Russian-speaking population in eastern and southern Ukraine. These \"pogroms\" were said to have been directed toward churches and synagogues, though local Jewish communities denied that any pogroms took place. Russia-1 and RIA Novosti claimed that these \"pogroms\" and \"anarchy\" resulted in a \"humanitarian crisis\" in Ukraine, and predicted that refugees would \"flood in\". In early March 2014, prior to the war in Donbass, Russian channels said large numbers of refugees were fleeing the \"chaos\" in Ukraine and portrayed the new Kyiv authorities as \"fascists,\" and an \"RT\" anchor declared that Russian military intervention was \"aimed only at saving Russian lives.\" \"Channel One\" presented footage from Shehyni, at a border crossing between Ukraine and Poland, as Ukrainians escaping to Russia. Russian state channels depicted Donbass civilians as under attack by Ukrainian forces and made no mention of insurgents firing from residential areas. They described the Ukrainian army's operations as \"punitive\" and presented the war in Donbass as a \"civil war\". On Russian citizens fighting against Ukraine, they \"repeated the official line that the troops are \"volunteers\" or travelled to Ukraine on leave rather than in any official capacity\" while describing foreigners fighting for Ukraine as \"mercenaries\". There were frequent mentions of \"Slavonic unity\" and \"Russian brotherhood\". A group of Russian nationalists prepared an international exhibition Material Evidence, presented with highly anti-Western and pro-Russian bias.\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", British historian Timothy Garton Ash said that Putin \"used television to impose his own narrative of a socially conservative, proud Russia threatened by fascists in Kiev, an expansionist NATO and a decadent EU.\" Joshua Yaffa of \"The New Republic\" reported a \"propaganda onslaught unprecedented in the post-Soviet era, implying or inventing dark suspicions about Western motives in Ukraine while painting Russia's own meddling as a heroic answer to the call of justice.\" In an interview with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, Peter Pomerantsev said, \"The Kremlin has reinvented the conflict in Ukraine as a genocide against Russians. People believe that the fascists are coming to get them, because that's what they have seen on TV, or that the CIA is behind massacres in Ukraine.\" Ingo Mannteufel of \"Deutsche Welle\" reported that \"Kremlin-run media outlets have been hammering the Russian people and foreign audiences with messages that \"fascist politicians and US intelligence agencies\" have taken over neighboring Ukraine\". The Russian media has employed \"Soviet language\", referring to \"traitors\", \"fascists\", and \"fifth columns\". In an open letter to Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian Jews, a mostly Russian-speaking community, said the Russian media had fabricated stories of forced Ukrainization, bans on the Russian language, and growth of anti-Semitism, and suggested that Putin had \"confused Ukraine with Russia, where Jewish organizations have noticed growth in anti-Semitic tendencies last year.\"\n\nThe Russian media focused particularly on Right Sector, portraying the group as powerful, fascist, and neo-Nazi and saying that it was persecuting Russian-speakers and Jews. Writing for \"Foreign Policy\", Hanna Kozlowska stated that Russian propaganda tried to demonize the Ukraine government and build a case for the annexation of Crimea by depicting Right Sector as a powerful neo-Nazi group which might take control of Ukraine. During the first half of 2014, Right Sector was the second-most mentioned political group in online Russian mass media. The Associated Press and other international news organizations found no evidence that the group had committed hate crimes. Right Sector and other far-right candidates had poor results in both the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election and parliamentary elections. Josef Zissels, chairman of the Vaad Association of Jewish Organization and Communities of Ukraine, stated: \"The failure of the ultranationalists reflects a reality which we have been trying to represent all the time despite Russian propaganda's attempt to portray Ukrainian society as intolerant.\" After the parliamentary election, Vyacheslav Likhachev of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress said that \"Russian propaganda speaks of a 'Ukrainian Fascist junta,' but in reality there are more voters for the far-right in the European Union than in Ukraine.\" Jillian Kay Melchior of the \"National Review\" found the claims of discrimination against Russian-speakers \"absurd,\" saying the Russian language was prevalent even in Kiev.\n\nDuring the Crimean crisis, Russian media supported the Russian government's assertions that Russian troops were not involved. Russian channels declared that Ukrainian nationalists from western Ukraine and Kiev were assaulting and killing Russians in Crimea; they claimed that a bus in Simferopol was carrying members of Right Sector who were attacking Crimean residents, although the footage showed a bus with Crimean license plates transporting men armed with Russian weapons, after roads to Crimea had been blocked by Russian soldiers. \"Russia 24\" used footage of Maidan square in Kiev to support its claims of chaos in Simferopol, Crimea. Claims of violence and suppression against Russian-speakers in Ukraine were used as justification for the Russian military intervention in Crimea. Russian media claimed that the western media ignored the apparent \"violence\", and that demonstrators in Crimea were protesting for democratic rights. In reference to this, Russian sources consistently refer to the events as the \"Russian Spring\", harking back to pro-democracy movements like the Prague Spring and Arab Spring. The annexation of Crimea was portrayed as the will of the people and a \"reunification\". Pro-Russian protesters in eastern Ukraine, including those who were armed and had taken journalists hostage, were portrayed as peaceful \"pro-federalization\" activists.\n\nAt the same time some Russian media were promoting anti-western and pro-war views: Channel \"Rossiya 2\" aired a short simulation of a Topol-M rocket hitting London while channel \"5\" simulated a conventional invasion on Warsaw, Berlin and Baltic states.\n\nAnti-government groups in eastern and southern Ukraine have been consistently characterized as \"local people bravely fighting for their rights\", as \"self-defence forces\", and as \"supporters of federalization\". According to broadcasts by the Russia-1 state television channel, \"Kiev threatened the citizens of Donetsk with psychological attacks from the air. Periodically, military helicopters and planes circle menacingly over the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk\". In addition, the Ukrainian army, which has launched various offensives against militants in Donetsk Oblast, has been continually portrayed as having \"low morale\", and being \"disorganized\". NTV, a television channel owned by Russian state oil company Gazprom, reported that \"Ukrainian troops refused to take orders from their commanders, and sided with pro-Russian militiamen\".\n\nIn July 2014, \"ITAR-TASS, RIA Novosti\", and \"LifeNews\" reported that pro-Russian separatists had shot down a Ukrainian military plane over Torez. When news emerged about the MH17 crash, Russian channels began promoting various theories, all of which suggested Ukraine was responsible. They considered the crash to be part of a U.S. conspiracy against Russia. Russian media claimed in late September that \"hundreds of unmarked graves of civilians executed by Ukrainian army\" were found and verified by OSCE monitors, a claim that was debunked by the OSCE and DPR officials. Other top stories, usually based on hearsay, with no accompanying evidence and illustrated by photos taken from unrelated incidents included a \"three-year-old boy crucified by Ukrainian servicemen\", \"parcel of land and two Russian slaves for Ukrainian soldiers,\" a woman with five different names and stories, \"Spanish air controller in Kiev\", \"satellite photo of Ukrainian fighter jet firing at Boeing\", \"Ukrainian fighter jet pilot confession\" (spread in Russian media as a viable explanations for the MH17 crash), Dmytro Yarosh winning the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, and Yarosh threatening to set off a grenade in Parliament. Rossiya Segodnya's \"Ukraina.ru\" website claimed that Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko had links with Lucifer. The story was later retracted from the original website. In August 2015 Komsomoloskaya Pravda published an alleged wiretap of two named CIA operatives planning an attack on MH17 but, which was ridiculed in Western media as the English used by both \"agents\" was very unnatural for a native speaker and resembled \"Google translated Russian phrases read from a script\".\n\nIn March 2015, TASS published a false report that the Carpatho-Rusyns had held a congress during which they decided to seek autonomy. Russian state media were also criticized for their reporting on Odessa Oblast, particularly claims of riots and persecution of ethnic minorities. Russia-1 presented Poroshenko's statement that Ukrainian would remain the only state language as a violation of the right to speak Russian freely, although a survey found that even Donbas and eastern oblasts preferred Russian to have the status of second official language in particular regions over \"state language\" status. In April 2015, Russian media widely reported a death of a 10-year-old girl killed by Ukrainian artillery but Russian reporters on the site interviewed by the BBC admitted that \"the girl never existed\" and they were reporting this fake story because they \"were instructed\" to do so. Further fake news in Russian media included alleged \"fascist attacks\" on Greek population in Crimea (which Greek embassy denied) and \"four American soldiers\" raping two underage girls in Ukraine. In May 2015, Izvestiya allegedly \"disclosed\" a letter from US Embassy to LGBT activists in Russia written in English with so many errors, that the US Departament of State republished it marking the errors in red with a dedication in Russian, suggesting that the authors ask for help while writing such letters next time.\n\nThe BBC reported that the Russian state media had a \"tendency to focus on events in Ukraine to the almost complete exclusion of problems at home.\" In May 2015, Slovak monitoring group \"MEMO 98, Internews Ukraine\", and \"Yerevan Press Club of Armenia\" completed a report on Russian TV channels for the Civil Society Forum of the Eastern Partnership. MEMO 98's Rasťo Kužel observed that Russian media \"diverted attention from important domestic issues and scared the population with the possibility of a war and the need of Russia to protect itself against an external enemy.\" In an interview for \"Deutsche Welle\", OSCE observer Paul Picard stated: \"We often see how Russian media outlets manipulate our statements. They say that we have not seen Russian troops crossing the borders. But that only applies to two border crossings. We have no idea what is going on at the others\" (Russia having refused to allow the OSCE to expand its mission).\n\nLeaked emails of Kristina Potupchik, former Nashi spokeswoman, later employee of President Vladimir Putin's administration, revealed wide-scale monitoring of any critical articles in Russia opposition media, placing paid comments and trolling by web brigades coordinated by Potupchik (according to earlier leaks she was involved in similar activities at least since 2012). For example, Potupchik reported to her supervisors about alleged irregularities in Alexei Navalny's passport application form, attaching its scans to the email. As noted by \"The Insider\", she had no legal way to obtain these forms as they are considered sensitive documents, and a few days later LifeNews reported exactly these irregularities as part of campaign against Navalny. According to Alexander Sytnik, a former member of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research, his organisation was one of the channels for \"illegal funding of pro-Russian analysts in Ukraine through third parties\".\n\nOn a number of occasions, Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Rogozin and Nikolai Patrushev have given examples of Western prejudice and hostility against Russia; one of these examples was an alleged statement by Madelaine Albright about Russia \"controlling too much of Siberia's resources\". As Russian independent media shortly found out, this phrase was never voiced by Albright, but instead by a former Russian security services officer Boris Ratnikov, who in 2006 gave examples of what kind of \"secret\" information he was able to extract from Western leaders using experimental \"remote mind control\" research. Even though the origins of the claim were traced in 2007, Russian leaders repeatedly used it as if it were a real statement. Asked by a journalist about this particular statement, Putin replied that \"I know this is what they think in their minds\".\n\nAccording to a linguistic analysis by Vasily Gatov, top Russian politicians started reusing classical language habits of Bolshevik leaders, such as self-questioning (\"a question arises...\"), metonymy (\"some countries...\") and expressions or anecdotes from criminal subculture.\n\nIn September 2015, Alexandr Bastrykin, head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, gave an interview in which he presented a version of events around the arrest of Nadia Savchenko that included her \"voluntarily crossing the Russian border\" and \"living for 4 days in hotels\" on the territory of Russia before she was arrested, and completely contradicted previous reports by Donetsk People's Republic militia of her being taken prisoner of war, including videos of her interrogation. In the same interview Bastrykin also accused Arseniy Yatsenyuk of taking part in the First Chechen War which, due to its surreal character was widely ridiculed in Ukrainian and Russian media, including a number of memes portraying Yatseniuk as a Chechen warlord. These accusations were based on testimonies from Mykola Karpyuk and Stanislav Klykh, Ukrainian citizens held in Russia since 2014, and forced using torture and extortion. Another Ukrainian citizen, Serhiy Litvinov, is also held in Russia and his forced testimonies were used by Russian media as a 'proof' of 'genocide of Russian nationals' as Litvinov was also charged with murdering twenty 'unidentified people' and a rape. By the end of 2014, most of the charges against him were dropped, leaving one robbery charge. According to Alexander Cherkasov, the prosecution statement in Karpyuk and Klykh contains errors and inconsistencies suggesting that it was written based on the Russian Wikipedia article on Salman Raduyev instead of any actual evidence.\n\nThemes of Russia's \"information war\" include Russia having the right to a \"sphere of influence\" and \"only laying claim to what is rightfully hers\", its neighbors being \"failed states\", Europe \"harming\" its economy and security by building ties with them, \"moral equality\" between Putin and the West, \"Western decadence\" and threats to \"traditional\" ways of life, Europe being most harmed by sanctions, Putin's government being \"legitimate\" and \"successful\", and obscuring Russia's role in post-Soviet crises by presenting them as ethnic conflicts. Descriptions of the Ukrainian government as \"illegitimate\" or \"self-appointed\" and the country as \"fascist\" were common in Russian reports during much of the conflict, but had declined sharply by the end of 2015. Ukraine was the main subject of negative reports until the Russian media shifted their attention to Turkey.\n\nAccording to war reporter and veteran of the First Chechen War Arkadiy Babchenko, Russian mass media played a significant role in starting the war in Donbass stating that \"this is the first war in history started exclusively by Goebbels-like propaganda\". Writing in March 2014 for \"Gazeta.ru\", Yekaterina Bolotovskaya said the Russian media was presenting an \"apocalyptic\" image of Ukraine. After a Russian channel claimed Ukrainians had crucified a child in Slovyansk, the former chief editor of Lenta.ru, Galina Timchenko, said, \"This is an egregious violation of professional ethics. Not only is there no proof anywhere -- this is not even being questioned.\" In March 2014, former economic minister Andrei Nechayev wrote, \"Our propaganda on state channels is really running wild.\" In July 2014, Andrei Malgin wrote in \"The Moscow Times\": \"I worked for Soviet newspapers during the terms of four Soviet leaders, from Leonid Brezhnev to Mikhail Gorbachev, and this is the first time the authorities have lied so brazenly and shamelessly. They have truly reached a new low.\" Boris Nemtsov stated that Vladimir Putin and the directors of Channel One Russia and Rossiya Segodnya employed \"Goebbels-style propaganda. If we are talking about the responsibility for spilling both Russian and Ukrainian blood, it lies not only with Putin, but also with such gentlemen as Konstantin Ernst or Dmitry Kiselyov. They operate in accordance with the simple principles of Joseph Goebbels: Play on the emotions; the bigger the lie, the better; lies should be repeated many times.\" Russian hacker group Shaltay Boltay published leaked Kremlin documents telling journalists to justify the Crimean annexation, praise Vladimir Putin's development plans, and depict Ukraine as swarming with fascists. \"Delovoi Petersburg\" and a journalist interviewed by \"Der Spiegel\" reported that several \"Ukrainian\" news sites, such as the \"Kharkov News Agency\", were based in Russia. The head of the Levada Center, Lev Gudkov, stated, \"The successful propaganda campaign we are witnessing here surrounding the Ukraine crisis is unique and highly sophisticated, even compared to Soviet standards.\" Maksim Trudolyubov, writing in \"Vedomosti\", said \"Today's state-run media in Russia is a continuation of the KGB but much smarter than previous incarnations. They use modern tools, misinformation, confusion, and conflicting signals to prevent any collective responses and actions of citizens.\" In 2016 Dmitry Kiselyov admitted using fake documents in his program.\n\nWriting for \"Sobesednik\", Dmitriy Bykov said \"the language of today's propaganda has become full of artificial connections. If you're against Russia's covert war in Ukraine then you must be for gluttony, against the motherland, and for soulless American fast food, only protesting against war because you want foie gras.\" In February 2015, Irina Prokhorova, leader of the opposition party Civic Platform, commented that nationalism and \"us vs. them\" thinking had grown among Russian media, saying: \"If I participate in some talk on television, they start accusing immediately, 'you're not patriotic, you're not a true citizen.\" Vladislav Inozemtsev wrote, \"The rhetoric of aggression and arguments justifying the use of force have become part of Russia's standard informational milieu.\" Maria Alekhina from Pussy Riot and Max Skibinsky also criticized the Russian media's style of reporting.\n\n\"Novaya Gazeta, Slon.ru, Grani.ru\" and \"Ekho Moskvy\" published some criticism of Russia's policy in Crimea and then Donbass. A number of them (such as Grani.ru) were placed on Russia's Internet blacklist as a result. Journalists who wrote commentary critical of the Russian government's actions usually experienced ostracism and were accused of being traitors or fascists by the mainstream media. Some experienced violence. In March 2014, \"Vedomosti\" published an article by a Moscow university professor, Andrey Zubov, who was subsequently fired, in which he compared Russia's military intervention in Crimea with Nazi Germany's Anschluss. Russian historians Alexandr Skobov and Andrey Piontkovski commented on the ideology of the self-declared Federal State of Novorossiya and concluded that its basic features (nationalism, imperialism) bear strong similarities with 20th century fascist movements. On 28 July, Skobov was assaulted by unknown perpetrators and received several stab wounds in St. Petersburg.\n\nCommenting for Ekho Moskvy in July 2014, a Russian military expert, Vadim Lukashevich, ridiculed the MH17 crash theories proposed by Russian media. Roskomnadzor issued a warning to the radio station after two journalists, Sergei Loiko and Timur Olevskiy, discussed the battle for Donetsk Airport. Vitaliy Portnikov, writing in \"Grani.ru\", mocked justifications of Russia's seizures of land. Alexander Podrabinek wrote that Putin had a history of using wars to increase and maintain his power and was now using a war with Ukraine to deflect opposition in Russia. In 2014, Boris Nemtsov wrote that the Kremlin demonstrated hypocrisy by advocating federalism for Ukraine, stating \"Russia itself has not had any sort of federal state for a long time, since 2004\", and said Putin sought to \"punish\" Ukraine in order to discourage a revolution against corruption from taking place in Russia. In \"Profile.ru\", Georgy Kunadze stated that \"If a country as similar to us as Ukraine will be able to overcome the post-Soviet syndrome and becomes a successful contemporary state, its example could prove infectious for Russia.\" In October 2014, Russian economic expert Stepan Demura criticized the Russian invasion of Ukraine and 2014 Crimean crisis, saying they would harm the Russian economy. Russian politician Leonid Gozman, commenting on Ekho Moskvy's blog, said that the only way to save Russia from the generals covertly sending soldiers to die in Ukraine is to \"give Ukraine advanced arms\".\n\nOn 14 February 2015 a Russian journalist Roman Saponkov published a video of separatist artillery shelling Ukrainian positions from Debaltseve, laughing in the background about \"what will RT say\", \"they must be using dummy ammunition, it's truce now\". Russian media have widely reported that and, as result, RT and TASS agencies who worked with Saponkov previously both publicly condemned his comments.\n\nIn April 2015 former Russian minister of finance Alexey Kudrin noted that the citizens are now victims of an information war started by the Russian government \"against its own citizens\", commenting on the process of pushing some independent media stations (TV Rain, Tomsk TV-2) out of the public sphere.\n\nIn June 2015 a NTV journalist, Konstantin Goldenzweig, left his position after 12 years of work, apologizing publicly for \"taking part in a collective propaganda madness\".\n\nOpponents of the war in Russia frequently face discrimination and coordinated hate campaigns, with the most extreme example being the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, which his daughter Zhanna Nemtsova blamed on Putin and Russian media. Writing for \"Vedomosti\", she stated that \"Russian propaganda kills. It kills reason and common sense but it also kills human beings.\" She said that Putin's \"information machine\" \"employs criminal propaganda techniques to sow hatred, which in turn spawns violence and terror. Its modus operandi? To dehumanise the target.\" In June 2015 Alexandr Byvshev, a poet whose anti-war works were banned as \"extremist\" earlier, was added to an official \"list of terrorists and extremists\" maintained by the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (\"Rosfinmonitoring\") and a \"spontaneous collective condemnation\" campaign, described as Soviet-style by independent media, began in his village.\n\nThe Russian media's portrayal of the unrest in Ukraine has received wide criticism from Asian, European, Ukrainian, and North American media and governments, with the coverage often described as \"propaganda\", and \"filled with omissions and inaccuracies\". The \"BBC\" reported on the use of misleading images, false narratives, misrepresentation and suppression. \"The New York Times\" referred to Russian reporting as a \"disinformation campaign\" by the Russian government and the \"Associated Press\" called it a \"Kremlin-led smear campaign.\" Critics said the coverage aimed to discredit pro-democracy protesters and justify a Russian military intervention. \"Der Spiegel\" wrote that Russian state TV \"has no qualms about blatantly fabricating the news.\" Writing for \"Reuters\", Lucian Kim said \"Lying – blatantly and repeatedly – is considered a legitimate weapon in the arsenal of hybrid warfare that Putin has unleashed in the struggle for Ukraine.\"\n\nAccording to Luc Maffre and Peter Pomerantsev, Russia's narrative has roots in Soviet dezinformatsiya and active measures. Some commentators believed that Russian state-controlled media attempted to sow confusion. Casey Michel said that they were trying \"to confuse and complicate, to muddle and muddy the facts on the ground, to create multiple realities to back manifold predispositions.\" Edward Lucas and Ben Nimmo called it \"information warfare\" designed to \"confuse, befuddle and distract\", \"to provoke doubt, disagreement and, ultimately, paralysis.\" Some said that Russian state media were disseminating hatred. Stephen Ennis of the \"BBC\" stated that Russian state TV \"appears to employ techniques of psychological conditioning designed to excite extreme emotions of aggression and hatred in the viewer.\"\n\nIn July 2014, \"The New Yorker\" reported that \"nearly all Russians derive their news and their sense of what is going on in the world\" from Russian state channels, whose broadcasts were described as \"feverish anti-Ukrainian, anti-American, and generally xenophobic\" and \"full of wild exaggeration about Ukrainian \"fascists\".\" According to Sergey Golunov, such portrayals are part of a long-term trend that started in the early 2000s:\n\nMany western and Ukrainian media outlets have accused Russian media of fabrications and misusing images and videos. Reporting for Watson.ch in Switzerland, wrote, \"For months, Russian propaganda has spread numerous false reports, fake photos and videos of Ukraine.\" In March 2014, alumni and students at the Kyiv-Mohyla School of Journalism started a project to identify false reports, \"StopFake.org\". In April 2014, Russia-1 presented a man by the name of Andrei Petkov as a pro-Russia activist who had been attacked by Ukrainians while NTV (Russia) called the same man Andrei Petkhov and said he was funding pro-Ukrainian extremists. Maria Tsypko appeared in various roles on Russian channels during the Ukrainian crisis. In May 2014, Russia-1 used footage from a 2012 conflict in the Russian region of Kabardino-Balkaria in a report alleging Ukrainian abuses against Russians; the deputy chief described it as an \"accidental error\" after a Ukrainian website, InfoResist.org, found the 2012 news report. The \"Kyiv Post\" reported that a journalist from the same channel, Yevgeni Poddubny, was involved in a plot to frame the Ukrainian army for the death of a Red Cross worker. Russian media also presented images from military conflicts in Georgia, South Ossetia, and Syria as being from Ukraine. \"Telekrytyka\" said an analysis of Russia-1's video of a gun battle in Crimea indicated it was staged. The same channel falsely presented a construction site as a \"concentration camp\" and a man critical of Euromaidan as a Ukrainian former diplomat, Andriy Veselovskyi.\n\nMultiple Russian news outlets have been criticized for producing unsubstantiated reports of atrocities. In June 2014, LifeNews aired footage which it said was evidence of Ukrainian forces using white phosphorus to attack a village named Semenyovka, near Sloviansk. Human Rights Watch analysts rejected the claim, saying that the footage was inconsistent with white phosphorus or an incendiary weapon. Other Russian news organizations aired footage of white phosphorus in Iraq to support their allegations against Ukraine. In July 2014, Channel One Russia stated that Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a three-year-old boy in Lenin Square in Sloviansk, although there is no such square in Sloviansk and the only witness to the alleged atrocity lied that she was a refugee from the town. The same channel used a 1995 photo of a mass grave in Chechnya to depict Ukraine. In August 2014, Russia's Zvezda channel was accused of editing footage of a failed rocket launch in Baikonur, Kazakhstan to use in a report claiming Ukraine attacked civilians in Makiivka. In September 2014, the BBC reported that REN TV had used images of MH17 plane crash victims to support its claims of atrocities by Ukrainian soldiers in eastern Ukraine. NTV (Russia)'s documentary \"13 Friends of the Junta\" (August 2014), which described anti-war activists and critics of Russia's policies in Ukraine as \"traitors\" and supporters of \"fascists\", also received criticism. \"The Moscow Times\" reported that footage of Andrei Makarevich's concert in Sviatohirsk \"was merged with images of the fighting that he supposedly endorsed. The program never mentions that the concert was for the benefit of Ukraine's internally displaced children.\" \"Ukrayina\" aired a documentary demonstrating how the NTV movie attributed actions of Russia-backed separatists to Ukrainian armed forces and used numerous other manipulations. \"StopFake.org\" reported that Rossiya Segodnya's Ukraina.ru mixed in images of the 2004 Beslan massacre, in southern Russia, into their documentary on Ukrainian children.\n\n\"BBC News\" found that Russian TV coverage of the 2 May 2014 Odessa clashes was misleading, noting that it \"either completely ignored or seriously misrepresented the street clashes that preceded the fatal fire, thus giving the impression that the attack by pro-Ukraine activists on Trade Union House was completely unprovoked\", made it seem that all the victims were pro-Russians, used manipulated or questionable evidence to support claims that several people had been murdered, and failed to mention that some pro-Ukrainian activists had attempted to help dying people. Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group said that the Russian state media's coverage disregarded the evidence and a United Nations report and she believed that \"fascist\" accusations were \"an attempt to justify Ukraine's dismemberment.\"\n\nParticular controversy erupted over English-language television channel \"RT\", which is owned by the Russian government. Referred to as the \"primary hub of Russian propaganda in the West\", it was accused of distortions and omissions, aligning its coverage to suit the Russian government, and fueling paranoia. The British communications authority Ofcom reviewed four news bulletins from early March 2014 and found that \"RT\" \"failed to preserve due impartiality.\" A presenter for the channel, Liz Wahl, resigned on air after saying that she disagreed with the channel's \"whitewashing\" of the Russian government's actions during the 2014 Crimean crisis. In July 2014, RT aired a controversial program, \"The Truthseeker: Genocide in Eastern Ukraine\", which it later removed after heavy criticism. Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group said it was \"full of lies\" and called it \"a truly sick broadcast\". In September 2014, Ofcom said it had launched an investigation. RT also received criticism after publishing a story based on a document found on a conspiracy website, which stated that the RAND Corporation was advising the Ukrainian government to carry out \"ethnic cleansing\" and set up internment camps for eastern Ukrainians. \"Der Spiegel\" wrote that Ivan Rodionov, the head of RT's video news agency \"Ruptly\", \"[defended] President Vladimir Putin so vehemently that one could be forgiven for confusing him with a Kremlin spokesperson.\" Having reported Rodionov's claim that the Ukrainian government held \"radical right-wing views\", \"Der Spiegel\" noted that his news site \"featured \"right-wing radicals like Britain's Nick Griffin or German far-right extremist Olaf Rose, an ideologist with the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NPD), stirring up hatred towards the European Union and its Ukraine policies.\" In 2015, \"RT\" falsely reported that Ukrainian officers had the right to shoot deserters. Glenn Greenwald said that \"RT\" was no worse than the leading British media but Casey Michel stated \"This trope – stating that all outlets are equally biased, and equally fallacious – exists firmly within the camp of whataboutism\". The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies described \"RT\" and \"Sputnik News\" as \"vital elements of the Russian propaganda machine\".\n\nIn May 2014, Cathy Young of \"The Daily Beast\" reported that journalists were being abducted and \"subjected to bizarre propaganda rituals on Russian television.\" Irma Krat, a journalist and Euromaidan activist who was held prisoner from April to July 2014 by pro-Russian militants, said that \"LifeNews\" interrogated her after she had been injected with a drug and that \"NTV (Russia)\" had manipulated footage: \"The interview was cut and spliced so that it makes me appear to have almost admitted to being a killer, a sadist, and as if I was renouncing the Maidan.\" \"Interpretermag.com\" said that some Russian reporters were involved in serious violations of journalism ethics. After pro-Kremlin station \"LifeNews\" approvingly filmed the abuse of Ukrainian POWs by pro-Russian forces, Dunja Mijatović of the OSCE said that the station's portrayal amounted to \"unethical and inadmissible reporting\" and an \"abuse of journalists' rights and privileges.\"\n\nSome Russian media have been accused of employing whataboutism as a response to criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. The firing of Galina Timchenko, chief editor of Russian news website Lenta.ru, after she published an interview with one of Right Sector's leaders, Andriy Tarasenko, was cited by western media as an incident of censorship. She also faced pressure to use material from Russia's state-run media. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty wrote that Russia-24's editing of RFERL's interviews was \"a useful case study in how a video's context can be shifted to represent one particular point of view.\" Rossiya Segodnya published an interview with Igor Girkin after removing his statements on working for Russia's Federal Security Service and chaos among pro-Russian militants.\n\nFollowing the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, an article in the Indonesian version of Business Insider described the way that Russia Today was covering the incident as \"ridiculous\" and \"in the only way it knows how: Blaming everyone except for the Russian government\" while Daniel Drezner noted how the Russian media narrative of the Malaysian airline shoot-down was a \"grab bag of conspiracy theories\" and suggested that Putin could become trapped by the nationalist rhetoric created over the incident. Moreover, an \"RT\" reporter, Sara Firth, resigned in protest against the network's coverage of the crash, which she said was heavily biased. She stated, \"We are lying every single day at RT. There are a million different ways to lie, and I really learned that at RT.\" The \"Associated Press\" reported that the theories presented by Russian broadcasters and newspapers \"vary wildly in content\" but \"all point the finger at Ukraine. None admits the possibility that Russia may bear responsibility.\" Julia Ioffe of \"The New Republic\" wrote that they were \"peddling conspiracy theories\" and \"trying to muddy the water\". Writing for \"The Atlantic\", Peter Pomerantsev said \"[Russian media] were trying not so much to convince viewers of any one version of events, but rather to leave them confused, paranoid, and passive—living in a Kremlin-controlled virtual reality that can no longer be mediated or debated by any appeal to 'truth.'\"\n\nIn early March 2014, Shaun Walker of \"The Guardian\" reported, \"Russian state television has gone out of its way to manufacture an image of the protests as a uniquely sinister phenomenon; a far-right movement backed by the west with the ultimate goal of destabilising Russia. [...] On the ground in Crimea, what is particularly odd is that the most vociferous defenders of Russian bases against supposed fascists appear to hold far-right views themselves.\" In August 2014, BBC News reported, \"Russian state TV's coverage of the crisis has been consistently sensationalist, using a wide repertoire of propaganda techniques to incite revulsion and hostility towards the authorities in Kiev.\" The Institute of Modern Russia wrote, \"Inside Russia, and in areas of eastern Ukraine where Russian television is popular, the Kremlin's political technologists have managed to create a parallel reality where \"fascists\" have taken power in Kiev, ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine are in mortal danger and the CIA is waging a war against Moscow.\" In March 2014, historian Timothy D. Snyder rejected the claims of a \"fascist coup\", stating \"Although one can certainly debate the constitutional nuances, this process was not a coup. And it certainly was not fascist. Reducing the powers of the president, calling presidential elections, and restoring the principles of democracy are the opposite of what fascism would demand.\" Some observers were critical of the Russian media's heavy focus on radical and right-wing groups during Euromaidan, finding that the protests were broad-based. Commenting in the Kyiv Post on \"fascist\" accusations against Ukraine, Lily Hyde wrote, \"Today's Russia, with its focus on a strong leader, primacy of the state, and aggressive imperial ambitions, is far more text-book \"fascist\" than Ukraine.\" The Kyiv Post's Oleg Sukhov and BBC News' Stephen Ennis accused Russian media of \"demonization\" of Ukrainians. Sukhov said Russian media regularly used fascist labels \"without pointing out the relatively low support for far-right groups among the Ukrainian population or the presence of neo-Nazis among Russian-backed insurgents,\" and he criticized their presentation of the Ukrainian crisis as \"orchestrated by the United States while ignoring Russia's direct involvement in support of separatists.\" Bernard-Henri Levy said the claims of \"fascism\" in Ukraine were part of a \"misinformation campaign.\" Sergei Loiko, a \"Los Angeles Times\" correspondent interviewed by \"Novoye Vremya Ukraine,\" criticized Russian channels, saying \"there were no reasons for [this war]. They are all fictional. They are built on lies, spread by Russian television. There was no reason for people to kill each other. It is a theatre of the absurd.\" In an article for \"The Irish Times,\" Conor O'Clery wrote, \"When leafing through Zhirinovsky's rag in Vnukovo airport it occurred to me how close his extreme outpourings are to those emanating from the mainstream Russian media.\"\n\nTimothy D. Snyder criticized the presentation of Russian-speakers in Ukraine as ethnic Russians who desired Russia's \"protection.\" In October 2014, Taras Kuzio wrote in the \"Financial Times\" that \"the world view created by Putin's state controlled media has never corresponded to reality. Putin always mixed up \"Russian speakers\" with \"Russians\" in Ukraine, believing they were one and the same. So he was always unable to fathom the fact that a large proportion of Ukrainian armed forces and National Guard are Russian speakers.\" The Russian media's depiction of the mainly Russophone city of Kharkiv as eager to join Russia was called \"wishful thinking\" by Katya Soldak of \"Forbes\", who said that events in the city and a survey conducted by Alexei Navalny did not support the portrayal. The University of Helsinki's Michael Gentile and Lucian Kim of \"Reuters\" were critical of the focus on ethnicity and language to explain the conflict in Donbas. Gentile stated that \"rather than being divided between Ukrainians and Russians, the Donbas is divided between people who believe in the concept of Ukrainian sovereign statehood and those who are nostalgic of the Soviet past.\" Kim wrote, \"As strenuously as the Kremlin propaganda machine raises the hobgoblin of Ukrainian nationalism, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia isn't about ethnicity or language — it's about the kind of country that people want to live in.\" Pierre Vaux, writing in Left Foot Forward, criticized \"the efforts of Kremlin propagandists to portray the Ukrainian government as waging a war on Russian speakers\", stating that \"large swathes of the government are Russian speakers. So are many of the military leaders in the east, including commanders of volunteer formations, such as Semyon Semyonchenko\". In addition to Russophones from Ukraine, about a hundred Russian citizens joined pro-Ukrainian forces, \"[discrediting] incessant Kremlin propaganda that Russian speakers are being persecuted in Ukraine\", according to the \"Kyiv Post\".\n\nAssertions that the West had broken an agreement against NATO enlargement were criticized by some commentators. Pavel Stroilov, who copied Kremlin documents, said that \"if the idea of a broken promise is being used as casus belli in Ukraine, it is being used fraudulently.\" Citing a 1995 article from \"The New York Times\", Anne Applebaum said the suggestion that the EU and NATO had provoked Russia was \"based on revisionist history promoted by the current Russian regime—and it is wrong. For the record: No treaties prohibiting NATO expansion were ever signed with Russia. No promises were broken.\" In 2014 interviews with \"Russia Beyond the Headlines\" and Germany's \"ZDF\", Mikhail Gorbachev also dismissed claims of a non-expansion pledge and said the idea that the West had deceived him was \"a myth. The press had a hand in it.\" According to Ben Nimmo of the Central European Policy Institute, the Russian media was \"distorting Western perceptions of the conflict. Claims that NATO promised not to expand into Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) after German reunification, and that Russia's fear of that enlargement is justifiable, have entered the mainstream media, creating the impression that the West is to blame for Russia's direct assault on Ukraine.\" Applebaum and French intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy rejected assertions that Russia had suffered \"humiliation\" and \"encirclement\". In an article for the \"Guardian\", Christopher Clark and Kristina Spohr wrote that \"misframing the past as a narrative of deceptions, betrayals and humiliations is a profoundly dangerous move\" which undermined \"the entire fabric of treaties and settlements that make up the post-cold war order.\" Accused of trying to \"encircle\" Russia and deepening divisions by accepting new members, NATO said that the statement \"ignores the facts of geography. Russia's land border is just over 20,000 kilometres long. Of that, 1,215 kilometres, or less than one-sixteenth, face current NATO members\" and referred to the \"Helsinki Final Act which says that every state has the right \"to belong or not to belong to international organizations, to be or not to be a party to bilateral or multilateral treaties including the right to be or not to be a party to treaties of alliance.\" And by signing the NATO-Russia Founding Act, Russia agreed to respect states' \"inherent right to choose the means to ensure their own security.\"\"\n\nEdward Lucas and Peter Pomerantsev noted that Russia's portrayal borrowed from Soviet narratives and terminology. \"By telling Russians that, as in 1941-45, they are fighting fascists, the Kremlin aims both to galvanize its own population but also to delegitimize any dissenters: to speak against the war is to betray Russia itself.\" Accusations of \"provocation\" appeared frequently in Russian discourse, turning \"the dynamics of the conflict [...] upside down: the attacker becomes the victim and the victim is accused of starting the conflict.\"\n\nOn 2 December 2014, the Ukrainian government created the Ministry of Information; according to its Minister, Yuriy Stets, one of its goals is \"active counteraction to the Russian information aggression\". In December 2014, Latvia's foreign minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, said that Russian news channels had become \"very aggressive in what can no longer be considered normal news or normal journalism, but is more information warfare and propaganda\" and said the EU was discussing whether \"to invest jointly in alternative sources of information — not alternative propaganda sources, but an alternative normal European TV channel, with entertainment, with news, but with very factually accurate news.\" Peter Pomerantsev said Russian reporting of the proposal sought to \"draw equivalence,\" adding, \"Just by saying, 'There's an information war,' it implies two sides doing equally naughty things, so it's OK for Russia to abuse information to spread disinformation.\" Andrew Kornbluth, writing in \"The Moscow Times\", said that \"Russian messaging has worked by exploiting vulnerabilities in precisely those mechanisms of self-criticism and skepticism which are considered so essential to the functioning of a democratic society.\" The \"Journal of Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society\" said that the Russian media \"fueled\" and \"legitimized\" the war and was \"surprisingly successful in distorting the war and the way it is perceived and understood.\" CEPI's Ben Nimmo described four Russian propaganda tactics (\"dismiss the critic, distort the facts, distract from the main issue and dismay the audience\") and reported that the campaign \"relies heavily on the Kremlin-controlled media, and paid or sympathetic commentators in the West, to pass its messages.\"\n\nRussia-1's \"Crimea: The Road to the Homeland\", which aired in March 2015, was criticized for distorting a March 2014 incident in which a man named Oleg Gorshkov attempted to stop a truck from breaking through a Crimean checkpoint, for unsupported claims of an anti-Crimean \"pogrom\" in Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi, and for a \"sycophantic\" Putin interview. The same month, three Russian channels claimed that a 10-year-old girl had been killed by shelling in the Petrovsky region of Donetsk; BBC News said that the story had been \"made up\".\n\nWriting for Lithuania's \"Delfi\", Viktoras Denisenko stated that \"Some Russian propaganda narratives are identifiable and exposed, but quite a lot of them are stealthy and reach their audience and successfully make their way into mass perception where they become entrenched.\" In April 2015, Lithuania's Radio and Television Commission banned RTR-Planeta for three months, stating that it had violated the law against \"war propaganda, hatred and inciting discord\" and ignored repeated warnings. Some Ukrainians responded to Russian reporting with humour while others found it inappropriate.\n\nIn September 2015 Linas Linkevičius called for more response and debunking to claims of Russian media, adding that \"a lie is not an alternative point of view\", which is an argument frequently used by media presenting \"Russian point of view\". According to the Centre for Eastern Studies, \"information campaigns using the stereotype of Russophobia are leading to a consolidation of political nationalism\" in Russia; \"attacking 'Russophobes' is a way of protecting Russian society itself from having any doubts about the Kremlin's policy\", \"mobilising them in the face of real or alleged threats\", and \"restoring psychological comfort\" after a failure.\n\nIn May 2016 Canal+ reviewed a number of reports by Rossiya 24 from France, verifying them with people interviewed by Russian journalists, and found out that their opinions were severely misrepresented by the Russian channel, either by manipulative editing or intentionally distorted translation. After the Canal+ program was aired, Rossiya 24 silently removed some of the most offending parts from the on-line version of their program.\n\nMany in the Western media described Ukrainian society as deeply \"divided\". Most reported the Euromaidan as a protest movement against corruption and for democracy, with a minority presence of far-right groups, though some suggested that they played the decisive role in armed confrontations. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's accumulation of wealth received coverage. Moscow's claims of fascism and western conspiracies were often included for balance.\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin was described variously as a \"bully,\" \"imperialist,\" and a \"brilliant\" and skilled leader. As of December 2014, BBC News and Reuters take no position on whether Russia is a party to the armed conflict, saying simply that Russia is \"accused\" by \"Ukraine and its Western allies.\" A few days after the OSCE's Observer Mission wrote that it \"continued to observe high numbers of dumper trucks transporting coal from the Luhansk region to the Russian Federation,\" \"Reuters\" reported on Russia's offer to sell coal to Ukraine, saying \"months of fighting a pro-Russian uprising has disrupted coal supplies\" but not mentioning the OSCE's observations. In 2015, the BBC and \"The Guardian\" continued to portray Odessa and Kharkiv as deeply divided, despite polls showing that supporters of separatism or joining Russia were a small minority. Western media avoided describing anti-Ukrainian foreign fighters as foreigners invading Ukraine, preferring to describe them as \"rebels\" or \"separatists\". \"The Daily Telegraph\" described a Russian citizen, who had no connection to Ukraine prior to taking up arms against its government, as a \"pro-Russian rebel\".\n\nSome western sources stated that the pro-Russian unrest was fomented by the Russian government and Russian special forces. Canada's \"The Globe and Mail\" accused Russia of \"manufacturing of chaos in Ukraine\" and described the chaos as \"made in Moscow.\" Some outlets proclaimed a \"new cold war\". Seeing similarities with Adolf Hitler's annexation of various lands with German-language speakers, such as Austria and the Sudetenland, some called the annexation of Crimea Russia's Anschluss. On Tony Brenton's proposal to make a deal with Putin, Con Coughlin of \"The Telegraph\" wrote, \"This seems uncomfortably similar to the appeasement arguments that were made in the 1930s – rather than confront Hitler over his threatening behaviour towards Germany's European neighbours, we should reach an accommodation with the Nazis.\" Conversely, Peter Hitchens of \"The Daily Mail\" accused the West of warmongering attitudes towards Russia: \"we think we are the heroes, setting out with brave hearts to confront the Dark Lord, and free the saintly Ukrainians from his wicked grasp\", and \"stupid, ill-informed people nowadays like to compare Mr Putin with Hitler\".\n\nIan Birrell, writing in \"The Independent\", criticized Western leaders, saying they had done \"little more than talk tough\" and \"Their failure is symbolized by verbal acrobatics as they avoid using the word \"invasion\", talking instead of \"incursion\" and \"aggression.\"\" Commenting on Barack Obama's refusal to send weapons to Ukraine as part of his policy of \"no military solution\" and avoiding escalation, \"The Washington Post\" said, \"weak U.S. and European support has allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to impose his own military solution as he has repeatedly escalated his aggression.\" \"Foreign Policy\" stated \"The West has dithered under the assumption that providing lethal aid to Ukraine would escalate the conflict. But a sanctions-dominant approach clearly has not prevented escalation. Indeed, with France's determination to sell the Mistral ships to Russia, the West is in the peculiar position of arming the aggressor and forbidding arms to the victim.\" Paul A. Goble was critical of Western governments' response, saying \"by signalling that it will not oppose a particular case of aggression, the West has taught Putin and his regime a lesson, but very much the wrong one: aggression works and after \"a decent interval\" will be ignored, have no consequences for relations with the West, and then can be repeated.\" In September 2014, \"GlobalPost\"'s Gregory Feifer commented on the Ukrainian perspective, stating, \"the arguments of some in the West who preach tolerance for Putin are generating anguish and disbelief – and increasingly outrage and hostility – toward the countries whose values Ukrainians believe they're being left alone to defend.\" In February 2015, Charles Crawford of \"The Telegraph\" concluded that Putin had been \"rewarded for his bullying.\"\n\nIn \"Foreign Policy\", Oliver Bullough said that Western countries, including the UK, Austria, and Switzerland, had enabled the theft of billions by the Yanukovych government and were making little effort to track and return Ukrainian money, concluding, \"If cynicism spreads among Ukrainians and they conclude that the West and Russia are as bad as each other -- and that, in essence, Westerners say pretty things but in reality care only for money -- then the revolution will fail.\"\n\nA number of U.K. and U.S. commentators echoed the Russian state media's portrayal of the Ukrainian crisis. Seumas Milne, John Pilger, John Mearsheimer, Stephen Cohen, and others blamed \"neo-Nazis\" in Ukraine and \"NATO expansion\", expressed understanding for Putin whom the West had \"provoked\", and presented Ukraine as a pawn which Russia was entitled to treat as its sphere of influence.\n\nSeumas Milne of \"The Guardian\" criticized NATO's eastward expansion, and stated that \"it is hardly surprising that Russia has acted to stop the more strategically sensitive and neuralgic Ukraine falling decisively into the western camp, especially given that Russia's only major warm-water naval base is in Crimea\". Likewise, John J. Mearsheimer, writing for \"The New York Times\", suggested that \"to save Ukraine and eventually restore a working relationship with Moscow, the West should seek to make Ukraine a neutral buffer state between Russia and NATO\", and \"take... NATO expansion off the table\".\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski, a former American National Security Advisor, said \"We have to convey to the Russians our concern that those words spoken by Putin are terribly reminiscent of what Hitler was saying about Austria before the Anschluss.\" Garry Kasparov criticized Western politicians, saying that many were \"lining up to become a new Chamberlain.\"\n\nThe referendum on Crimean independence was considered \"illegitimate\", \"un-democratic\", and \"under the barrel of a gun\". Many western sources state that the anti-government groups were actually Russian special forces incognito, referred to as \"little green men\", and that the unrest was intentionally fomented by the Russian government.\n\nRussian criticism frequently involved claims that the western media ignored the influence of right-wing nationalist groups like Right Sector and the right to self-determination of those in eastern and southern Ukraine, misrepresented Euromaidan as \"peaceful,\" and failed to understand that the \"corrupt\" former president Viktor Yanukovych was \"no worse\" than many of the opposition leaders, including the very wealthy Yulia Tymoshenko. Seumas Milne, writing for \"The Guardian\", perceived \"demonisation\" of Putin and Russia by the Western media: \"the anti-Russian drumbeat has now reached fever pitch\", \"Putin has now become a cartoon villain and Russia the target of almost uniformly belligerent propaganda across the western media\", and \"anyone who questions the dominant narrative on Ukraine... is dismissed as a Kremlin dupe\". In Left Foot Forward, Pierre Vaux described Milne's article as \"the distorted apologia of a Kremlin advocate, one who performs front-of-house PR duties with the president himself\" and questioned The Guardian's decision to publish it despite its own editorial criticizing moral relativism and disinformation. Some believed Western media were attempting to shore up the West's \"waning influence\". In a piece that appeared in \"The Guardian\", former British Ambassador to Russia Tony Brenton wrote that the western media \"routinely downplayed the Russian side of the story\", and that the \"confrontational course\" that the British government had taken on Ukraine \"had been undoubtedly eased by ministers knowing they are playing a largely anti-Russian press\".\n\nTo counter Russian propaganda, Ukrainian journalists suggested that the European Union support the development of \"a new generation of scholars focused on Eastern Europe as opposed to those seeing Eastern Europe through Russian lenses.\" Salome Samadashvili of the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies stated that the West's \"view of the realities in the former captive nations of the USSR is often clouded by years of exposure to the Russian point of view.\"\n\nSome writers for western newspapers, including Stephen F. Cohen of \"The Nation\" and columnists for \"The Guardian\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\", were accused of apologism for Russia—justifying its actions. According to Isaac Chotiner of the \"New Republic\", Cohen's writing implied that \"some sort of control over Ukraine is a requirement of Russian greatness. And then, after explaining this, [Cohen] says the whole crisis was \"imposed\" on Putin! This is apologetics done well: first you explain why bad behavior is actually sensible, and then you say that the bad behavior wasn't really under the control of the bad actor.\" Pomerantsev and Weiss said that Cohen was using \"willful misinterpretations\" of statements by Ukrainian officials. James Kirchick of \"The Daily Beast\" described \"The Nation\" as \"Pravda, in English\". Cohen responded to criticism by stating that he sees Washington's hostility towards Russia as counterproductive and dangerous to both Russia and the US: \"Before this began, Putin was the best potential partner we had anywhere in the world to pursue our national security\", and \"American national security still runs through Moscow\". Some critics said pro-Russian western media used whataboutism and focused disproportionately on the minority of Euromaidan protestors who belonged to the far-right. The portrayal of the situation in Ukraine as primarily a conflict between the West and Russia, minimizing Ukraine, also received criticism. Julia Ioffe of \"The New Republic\" wrote: \"Ukraine, you see, is just \"a former Soviet republic\" and a catalyst for feelings between Russia and the West. It's a thing that can be \"smuggled into NATO\" because its desire or non-desire to be in NATO is automatically less important than how that \"smuggling\" would make Russia feel.\"\n\nSome portrayals of Ukrainians were described as \"patronizing\", reducing Ukrainians to \"pawns\" of the CIA. Alexander J. Motyl of \"World Affairs\" criticized articles by Andranik Migranyan in \"The National Interest\" and Katrina vanden Heuvel and Stephen F. Cohen in \"The Nation\", saying that \"None of the texts sees Ukrainians as agents with a voice: they are marionettes, following the dictates of Washington. [...] Putin and Migranyan probably can't see that this is racism. Vanden Heuvel and Cohen, who rightly rail against racism on the pages of the Nation, should know better.\" Some commenters criticized Western media who blamed EU and NATO \"expansionism\" into Russia's \"sphere of influence\". Anton Shekhovtsov, writing for Searchlight, said Ukrainians were deprived of agency and portrayed as a \"mob allegedly manipulated by the West against Russia.\" Fabio Belafatti, a lecturer at Vilnius University, was critical of Western media: \"Reading many of the articles that accuse the West of \"causing\" the Ukrainian chaos by \"provoking\" Russia in its strategic interests and wounding its pride of great power, it's clear how the authors write from a distorted, hierarchical and, ultimately, orientalist (if not outright racist) perspective on the small countries of Eastern Europe.\"\n\nJames Bloodworth of \"The Daily Beast\" criticized British newspapers, saying a perception of Russia as mistreated \"extends deep into the Conservative press\" and added that \"the left has its own share of useful idiots.\" He felt their writing implied \"any Ukrainian desire for self-determination can go to hell: Putin is right to be concerned about the loss of his \"sphere of influence.\"\" Historian Timothy D. Snyder found that both far-right and far-left publications echoed the positions of the Kremlin and Yanukovych. Canadian historian Stephen Velychenko saw double standards, saying: \"Latin Americans or Asians who reject US-Corporate hegemony are celebrated and supported as freedom fighters while eastern Europeans who reject Russian domination are condemned as extremists and Nazis.\" In an interview with \"New Eastern Europe\", Andrew Wilson said, \"The way that the left talks about Russia's \"legitimate interests\" in Ukraine is bizarre. They would never say the same about Britain's legitimate interests in India or France's legitimate interests in Algeria.\" John Mearsheimer's article for \"Foreign Affairs\" was criticized by Anders Åslund of the Peterson Institute, Mariana Budjeryn of \"World Affairs\", Alexander J. Motyl of \"World Affairs\", and Tom Nichols of Thefederalist.com. Aslund said it showed \"contempt for democracy, national sovereignty, and international law. His thesis is that Russia has the right to decide the fate of the countries in its neighborhood in its own interest. [...] Mearsheimer is denying countries their right to self-defense or to join NATO.\" Budjeryn also dismissed Mearsheimer's argument that the EU and NATO had provoked the conflict: \"That the Russians failed to design a model of development and a security arrangement that would be equally attractive and did not require arm-twisting to keep together is not the West's fault. Turns out, democracy and rule of law is not the West's property to peddle around the world, but a political model post-Communist societies chose to pursue when they were free to do so.\" Motyl criticized Mearsheimer's article for \"empirically preposterous claims\" and \"evidentiary cherry-picking, citing only those Russian claims that support realism, while ignoring the many others that do not.\" Thefederalist.com's Tom Nichols questioned the depiction of Putin as a Russian nationalist and realist, writing that Putin had \"reminded a previously slumbering NATO why it exists,\" \"invigorated Ukrainian nationalism,\" \"[violated] almost every rule of competent strategy\" (\"needless multiplication of enemies\" and \"letting emotion overcome policy\"), and was drawing the US into the conflict, saying Barack Obama's administration \"has no interest in a fight and would just as well walk away from European affairs if only given half a chance.\"\n\nIn March 2014, Alan Yuhas wrote in \"The Guardian\", \"The occupation of Crimea by pro-Russian forces has been accompanied by a remarkable propaganda push by Moscow – an effort that has infiltrated western media and helped redefine the debate in Russia's favor.\" In \"World Affairs,\" Arthur Milikh criticized Western journalism, saying \"much of the Western media, unwittingly complicit, maintain a spirit of scepticism to avoid open accusations against [Putin]. For example, many of those labelled Ukrainian \"separatists\" are in fact Russian-trained and -equipped troops.\" Some suggested false balance in Western reports on Ukraine. Paul A. Goble wrote that \"Putin's lies have defined the situation rather than facts on the ground, and the Western media's focus on balance – on presenting all sides of the case even if one or more is untrue – gives thuggish leaders like him an opening.\" Razom said that \"Western media prides itself on showing all sides of any story, and so disseminates propaganda in a doe-eyed pursuit of unbiased reporting.\" According to Chatham House, \"the emphasis on 'balance' in many Western media ensures that Russian narratives, no matter how patently fraudulent, are repeated to European and American audiences by their own media.\"\n\nOccidental College's Agnia Grigas and the Cicero Foundation's Marcel Van Herpen wrote that Russian propaganda \"has insinuated itself into and been internalized by the Western media, complementing Russia's military tactics in achieving Putin's expansionist goals.\" Laas Leivat of \"Estonian Life\" also found that Western media were \"internalizing\" Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as an \"irreparably dysfunctional\" and \"deeply divided\" country. Interpretermag.com's Catherine A. Fitzpatrick said mainstream media ignored allegations that Russian reporters had committed serious violations of journalism ethics. In March 2015, Garry Kasparov said \"Western media inexplicably continue to air, unchallenged, statements by [Putin's] cadre of propagandists.\" According to a May 2015 report by the Atlantic Council, Moscow had succeeded in \"setting the terms of the narrative for the Ukrainian conflict: international media typically refer to the separatists in Ukraine as if they are a distinct party to the conflict rather than an instrument of the Kremlin. When the Ukrainian government or even Western governments discuss the presence of Russian weapons or soldiers in the east, the media present their statements and then the Russian denial as if they were of equal value, but they are not.\"\n\n\"Newsweek\" was criticized for articles by Damien Sharkov and Felicity Capon. Sharkov and the executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, falsely claimed that Ukrainian lawmakers had passed a motion allowing deserters to be shot. Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group found western reporting of the 2015 Ukraine bus attack lacking: \"The BBC and other western media reports present the Ukrainian side, then the militant denial, leaving out any detail about the labyrinth of different versions from the latter.\"\n\nCasey Michel stated that many Western media \"maintained a bulwark against Russian obfuscation\" but others were \"pushing Russia's fantasies\" such as \"Russia is the victim!\" Yuri M. Zhukov said that \"ethnocentric\" western and Russian portrayals of the war in Donbas, i.e. focusing on language and ethnicity, were not supported by data on the violence, which showed a stronger connection with local economic factors.\n\nUkrainian media stated that the unrest in Ukraine was manufactured by Russia. They have consistently accused Russia of being a provocateur, and of controlling the anti-government groups behind the scenes. The annexation of Crimea was viewed as illegitimate and illegal. Following the start of the War in Donbass, the Ukrainian government and some media described the armed groups of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic as \"terrorists\" and \"separatists\" and referred to the military operation against the DPR and LPR as an \"anti-terrorist\" operation.\n\nIn September 2014, \"Kyiv Post\" was critical of the West's response to the crisis, stating \"Ukraine can never surrender its nation and the West should be ashamed of its ongoing appeasement of Putin, who is trying to veto the Western, democratic aspirations of Ukrainians who do not share his warped dream of recreating a version of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian media published some fake news stories and false reports, including a dead rebel photograph with a Photoshop-painted tattoo which allegedly indicated that he belonged to Russian Special Forces, a video game screenshot disguised as a satellite image ostensibly showing the shelling of the Ukrainian border from Russia, and the threat of a Russian nuclear attack against the Ukrainian troops.\n\nHalya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group criticized Russia's calls for \"federalization\" of Ukraine while quickly suppressing autonomy initiatives within Russia. Ukrainian media widely condemned the November 2014 Donbass general elections, with comparisons to elections in the Soviet Union, and Oleksiy Matsuka, chief editor of \"Donbass News\" called the poll \"votes for vegetables.\"\n\nIn April 2014, historian Timothy D. Snyder stated that \"Ukraine is now the site of the largest and most important free media in the Russian language, since all important media in Ukraine appear in Russian, and since freedom of speech prevails. Putin's idea of defending Russian speakers in Ukraine is absurd on many levels, but one of them is this: people can say what they like in Russian in Ukraine, but they cannot do so in Russia itself.\" In August 2014, BBC News stated that Ukrainian coverage depicted Russia in a \"negative light but language has been restrained in comparison to that on Russian TV.\" They reported that Ukrainian media were increasingly airing \"direct accusations\" and \"harsh criticism\" of Russia but \"alternative opinions are also aired, and presenters make no attempt to block dissent.\" Conversely, Joseph L. Black, the Distinguished Research Professor at the Carleton University, stated that Ukrainian media used dehumanizing language towards the rebels, referring to them as \"Colorado beetles\" and calling for their \"extermination as vermin\"; in his view, the \"Russian official press releases and websites were less inflammatory in their language\". Likewise, Mikhail A. Molchanov, professor and former chair of the Department of Political Science at St. Thomas University, said that the Ukrainian media consistently portrays Russia as an Asiatic \"other\" of \"European\" Ukraine and the West, referring to it as a \"madhouse\" and \"Mordor\", and to the Russians as \"not a people, but a rabble\".\n\nIn December 2014, Reporters Without Borders condemned the creation of the Ukrainian Ministry of Information, which is intended to counteract \"Russian propaganda\", observing that \"In a democratic society, the media should not be regulated by the government.\"\n\nIn September 2014, Japan's \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" said, \"The latest ceasefire accord is defective in that it does not mention the withdrawal of thousands of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine. [...] It is essential to ensure the withdrawal of Russian troops and end Russia's provision of arms to the rebels to maintain the integrity of Ukrainian sovereignty and territory.\" France's \"Le Figaro\" wrote that Vladimir Putin's policies were \"pushing Ukraine into the arms of NATO.\" In Switzerland's \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\", Volker Pabst wrote: \"Putin needs an external enemy to suppress criticism and to keep his corrupt system going. He is therefore increasingly provoking foreign policy crises.\"\n\n\"Agence France-Presse\" presented the toppling of Communist monuments as \"anti-Russian sentiment\".\n\nIn an article published in February 2014 by RFERL, Glenn Kates said some media's maps, such as one presented by Al Jazeera, oversimplified the divisions in Ukraine. Andriy Portnov said, \"The German, as well as British or French media, quite often publish misleading maps of 'ethnic zones'\" and \"automatically [ascribe] the preferred language of everyday communication to political preferences and even ethnicity.\"\n\nIn May 2014, \"Der Spiegel\" reported that \"when German talk shows invite Russian journalists to speak about the Ukraine crisis, they are almost always pundits who could have been taken directly out of the Kremlin propaganda department.\" Munich University's Fabian Burkhardt studied the presentation of the Ukraine crisis on German talks shows, reviewing 81 guests from December 2013 to April 2014. He reported a \"heavy lean towards pro-Russia guests,\" with many having \"economic ties to Russia,\" and found that of the 27 guests who were journalists, none were from Ukraine, compared to eight from Russia, while most of the German journalists were experts on Russia rather than Ukraine. In December 2014, a statement signed by over 140 German intellectuals criticised \"superficial reporting and frequent appearances of Kremlin mouthpieces in television discussions on Ukraine\" which had resulted in \"misinformation and biased interpretations regarding Ukraine\" becoming \"anchored in the minds of many ordinary people\".\n\nBy January 2015, media coverage of events in Ukraine had decreased significantly. The former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt said, \"It's striking how most media just avoid the battles in eastern Ukraine. It's ongoing aggression in Europe. It must not be seen as normal.\"\n\nIn \"New Eastern Europe\", Sławomir Budziak stated that new pro-Russian media outlets had appeared in the Czech Republic, publishing \"far-fetched claims, speculations, conspiracy-mongering, lies, defamation and propaganda\" which fostered \"a state of doubt\" and \"mistrust\" in readers.\n\nWestern media have generally referred to armed anti-government and pro-Russian groups in Ukraine as \"rebels\" or \"separatists.\" \"Reuters\" describes the events in eastern Ukraine as an \"uprising\" and \"revolt\" by \"separatists.\" Casey Michael of \"The Moscow Times\" questioned the use of \"Ukrainian\" and \"rebels\" to describe the armed pro-Russian groups, saying that their leadership and many fighters were \"outsiders and usurpers, men with either mercenary or imperial motivations.\" Laas Leivat of \"Estonian Life\" criticised the use of the term \"separatists,\" saying it \"obscures the reality of the situation\" and \"supports the Kremlin's version of events.\" As of December 2014, \"BBC News\" and \"Reuters\" prefer the terms \"crisis\" and \"conflict\" over \"war\". The word \"invasion\" was usually avoided, a choice criticized by Garry Kasparov, Ian Birrell of \"The Independent\", and Trudy Rubin of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". In April 2015, Julian Reichelt of Bild.de wrote that the \"deceptive language of politics\" (e.g. efforts \"to prevent a war in Ukraine\") often influenced reporting, making journalists \"complicit in disguising what is actually happening in Ukraine, where a war is already in full swing.\"\n\nPeter Dickinson stated that the Western media was \"enabling\" Russian aggression against Ukraine. He called it \"absurd\" that Western media described a foreigner who had arrived from Russia to fight against Ukraine, such as Arsen Pavlov, as a \"pro-Russian separatist\" and stated that the media was \"creating the impression of a Russia-leaning local who was defending his democratic rights.\"\n\nRussia's actions were described as terrorism by Alexander J. Motyl of \"World Affairs\", Marius Laurinavičius writing for Lithuanian Delfi, and Taras Kuzio in \"New Eastern Europe\". Brian Bonner, chief editor of the \"Kyiv Post\", decided to avoid the term, stating \"While I certainly believe Russia and its proxies are committing terror in the east and are guilty of war crimes, the label \"terrorist\" does nothing to illuminate the reasons for their actions or present the combatants as human beings.\" He also avoids the term \"rebel\", finding it \"too gentle\", and \"civil war\", saying \"This conflict simply would not be happening if it were not instigated by Russia. There is no fratricidal conflict in the east among Ukrainians, nor is there much support for any kind of secessionist movement in the Donbas.\" Anne Applebaum, in \"The Washington Post\", also questioned the use of \"civil war\", describing the war in eastern Ukraine as \"an artificial conflict, run by Russian security and enhanced by a sophisticated pan-European disinformation campaign.\" Criticizing the term's use in German media, Reichelt wrote that it \"comes straight out of Putin's propaganda machine, which frames the war as a national issue rather than an act of aggression. Calling it a [civil war] is an insult to the people who are being attacked, to our readers, and to our profession.\"\n\nAccording to an April 2014 poll by the Razumkov Centre in Ukraine, the Russian media was trusted by 12.7% of respondents, the western media by 40.4%, and the Ukrainian media by 61.5%. After a survey conducted from 5–13 September 2014, the International Foundation for Electoral Systems reported 5% of Ukrainians had a \"great deal\" or \"fair amount\" of confidence in the Russian media, 42% in the Western media, and 67% in media based in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian media had more influence in parts of Donbass. Having spoken to anti-Kiev protesters in Donetsk in March 2014, Lucian Kim of Reuters said, \"In my 20 years as a journalist, I had never experienced such hostility – especially from a group that was supposedly facing persecution. [...] Besides a few stock phrases about a \"referendum\" and \"the illegitimate Kiev junta,\" I also got no answers as to their motivations. It was like trying to have a conversation with a TV – Russian state TV.\"\n\nA controversy developed over some reactions by the public to the media's coverage. In March 2014, the Polish version of \"Newsweek\" expressed suspicion that Russia was employing people to \"bombard\" its website with pro-Russian comments on Ukraine-related articles. Poland's governmental computer emergency response team later confirmed that pro-Russia commentary had \"flooded\" Polish internet portals at the start of the Ukrainian crisis. In May 2014, \"The Guardian\" noted a large number of pro-Kremlin comments on news articles relating to Ukraine, which the newspaper believed was an \"orchestrated pro-Kremlin campaign\". \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\", \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\", \"Der Spiegel\", and Reuters reported that German-language media websites had been \"flooded\" with pro-Russia comments since March 2014. \"Novaya Gazeta\", \"BuzzFeed\", \"Yle\", \"\", Agence France-Presse, Associated Press, \"Der Spiegel\", \"The New York Times\", and others reported on allegations that a Russian company, the Internet Research Agency, employed hundreds of workers to write comments in both Russian and western news sites. Dubbed a \"troll factory/house/farm\" by the media, it operates out of a building on Savushkin Street in Saint Petersburg, following a move from the outskirts of the city. The agency may also have a location in Moscow. Jürg Vollmer of \"Watson.ch\" reported that Putin had developed the company since 2011 to \"systematically manipulate public opinion on the Internet.\" Ilya Klishin of \"Dozhd\" said his sources suggested that Russian expats in Germany, India, and Thailand were also involved. Russian blogger Anton Nosik said in August 2014 that \"Comments were already serving as a well-financed Kremlin instrument of war against the opposition, even five years ago [...] But what's absolutely clear is that now they're spending more money on Ukraine than they ever spent against Aleksei Navalny, or Ekho Moskvy, \"Kommersant,\" gazeta.ru, and all the rest.\" Paid commenters may earn 45,000 roubles a month or 65,000 if they know a foreign language. Their tasks included presenting Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia, the Ukrainian government as fascist, Vladimir Putin as superior to leaders of other countries, and Western countries as depraved. The Kremlin is also active on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, LiveJournal, VK.com, and Odnoklassniki.\n\nA poll conducted in December 2014 found that 63% of Germans have \"little or no trust\" in the coverage by German media of the Ukrainian conflict. This is compared to 53% for the coverage of the Islamic State and 40% for coverage about the recent strike of German locomotive drivers. When respondents who said that they do not trust German media when it comes to Ukraine were asked why they have mistrust, 31% gave the reason as \"coverage is one-sided/not objective\", 18% said that \"the coverage does not correspond to reality\", and 9% said \"the coverage is imprecise/not sufficiently comprehensive\".\n\nSome journalists were physically assaulted or intimidated during the Ukrainian crisis. Tetiana Chornovol, a journalist who was one of the leaders of the Euromaidan protests, was severely beaten and sustained a concussion in December 2013 in Boryspil. Also during Euromaidan, Ihor Lutsenko was attacked by unknown assailants and RFERL journalists were injured by riot police. According to Reporters Without Borders, Vyacheslav Veremyi (\"Vesti\") died after he was pulled from his taxi and shot by unknown assailants and 27 other journalists were injured in Kiev on 18 and 19 February in attacks mostly by Berkut and unknown assailants. Oleksandr Yaroshenko (writing as Serhiy Levitanenko), an Odessa journalist who was critical of Vladimir Putin, was beaten on three occasions in the first half of 2014 and his apartment set on fire.\n\nJournalists were particularly vulnerable in eastern parts of Ukraine. In April 2014, staff of \"Provintsiya\", the local newspaper in Kostiantynivka, Donetsk Oblast, were threatened for reporting critically on the Donetsk People's Republic and the newsroom was burned down. In May 2014, \"The Daily Beast\" reported that pro-Russian militants were conducting \"systematic abductions\" of journalists. Irma Krat was held by insurgents from April to July 2014, accused of beheading Berkut members, and injected with a drug before being interrogated. After Oleksiy Matsuka reported on links between pro-Russian separatists and Moscow, his car was set on fire and leaflets calling him a traitor were circulated in his hometown, Donetsk. \"Pro Gorod\", a pro-Ukraine newspaper in Torez, was attacked in April 2014. On 21 April 2014, pro-Russian insurgents in Sloviansk abducted Simon Ostrovsky of \"Vice News\", holding him in a basement and beating him before releasing him on 24 April. Vyacheslav Ponomarev said Ostrovsky \"needs to learn a lesson\" and Ponomarev's spokeswoman, Stella Khorosheva, accused Ostrovsky of \"not reporting in a correct way.\" In May 2014, German journalist Stefan Scholl and Pavel Kanygin of \"Novaya Gazeta\" were abducted in Artemivsk by four men who accused Kanygin of \"failure to make it clear that the insurgents were good guys fighting fascist oppression.\" Scholl was soon released and Kanygin was also released after the abductors were paid. Serhiy Lefter, a Ukrainian journalist for Poland's Open Dialogue Foundation, was kidnapped and held for three weeks by insurgents in Sloviansk. Sergey Zakharov, an artist from Donetsk whose work satirized pro-Russian fighters, was held for six weeks and tortured.\n\nOther journalists who disappeared in militant-controlled areas included Roman Cheremsky, Valery Makeyev, Yehor Vorobyov, Yury Lelyavsky, Dmitry Potekhin, and Oleksandr Bilokobylsky. Taken prisoner by LPR militants on 9 January 2015, Luhansk journalist Maria Varfolomeyeva was accused in March of spying for the Ukrainian military in late January, although she was in captivity at the time. Sometimes family members of journalists were also seized. In August 2014, when militants of the Donetsk People's Republic were unable to find Donetsk journalist Viktoria Ishchenko, who had moved to Kiev, they took her parents. The same month, militants from the Luhansk People's Republic seized Luhansk journalist Serhiy Sakadynsky, holding him until January 2015, and his wife, Mariya Havak, holding her for two months. The Institute for Mass Information and the Independent Media Union of Ukraine – which began holding annual Enemies of the Press awards in 2007 – reported in June 2015 that the DPR and LPR were the most dangerous places in Ukraine for the media, citing 64 cases of abducted journalists, 21 cases in which journalists were beaten up, and 35 attacks on media offices which refused to cooperate with militants.\n\nSome journalists and media workers died during the war in eastern Ukraine. On 24 May 2014, an exchange of mortar fire near Sloviansk resulted in the deaths of Italian photojournalist Andrea Rocchelli and his interpreter, Andrey Mironov, and leg wounds to French photographer William Roguelon. Rossiya 24 journalist Igor Kornelyuk and sound engineer Anton Voloshin died on 17 June 2014 during mortar fire near Luhansk. Anatoliy Klyan of Channel One Russia died on 29 June 2014 in Donetsk Oblast when his bus came under fire while approaching a Ukrainian military unit in the middle of the night. Andrei Stenin died in unclear circumstances. Serhiy Nikolayev, a photojournalist for \"Segodnya\", died on 28 February 2015 from wounds sustained during shelling in Pisky, Donetsk Oblast.\n\nThe Ukrainian television journalist was arrested by Ukrainian authorities on suspicion of treason for posting a video on YouTube urging people to dodge the new military draft. He faces imprisonment of up to fifteen years. On March 18, the editor of \"The Working Class\" and former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada was arrested under paragraph 1, article 110 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine, \"Violation of territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine\", for publishing two articles in his newspaper.\n\nIn May 2016, the Ukrainian hacker website Myrotvorets, which is curated by SBU and Ukrainian authorities, published a list of journalists who received press accreditation in Donetsk People's Republic in order to cover war on both sides; the journalists have been labeled as \"collaborators with terrorists\". Since the publication, a number of these journalists (including Hromadske.TV reporter Yekaterina Sergatskova and freelance journalist Roman Stepanovich) received death threats in emails and phone calls. The data publication was condemned by David Weisbrot, the chair of the Australian Press Council, as well as G7 ambassadors to Kyiv and an international group of journalists, including the BBC, The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and The Economist.\n\nFollowing Russia's annexation of Crimea, the Committee to Protect Journalists found a rise in attacks on the press. Roskomnadzor required that news outlets register as Russian entities by 1 April 2015. The body granted registration to 232 out of 3,121 outlets (8%) by that date. The Institute for Mass Information and the Independent Media Union of Ukraine noted 32 cases of censorship, 13 abductions or illegal detentions of journalists, and 11 attacks on editorial offices. Media were threatened with denial of registration if they criticized the annexation or described the situation as an \"annexation\" or \"occupation\" of Crimea. They were prevented from taking photographs or recording video of pro-Ukrainian gatherings.\n\nSome journalists were assaulted and intimidated in Russia, including Vladimir Romensky (Dozhd), Ilya Vasyunin (Russkaya Planeta), Nina Petlyanova (Novaya Gazeta), Irina Tumakova (Fontanka.ru), Sergey Kovalchenko and Sergey Zorin (Telegraph agency). Alexandr Skobov was stabbed in July 2014 after writing an article for \"Grani.ru\" criticising the ideology of the self-declared Federal State of Novorossiya. In August 2014, Arseniy Vesnin sustained a concussion in an attack while he was reporting for Ekho Moskvy on demonstrators supporting Ukraine in Saint Petersburg. Lev Shlosberg (Pskovskaya Guberniya) was beaten unconscious in August 2014 in Pskov while investigating the alleged deaths of Russian paratroopers in eastern Ukraine. A BBC crew was attacked in September 2014 in Astrakhan, also while investigating Russian soldiers' deaths. Ksenia Batanova, a journalist and producer for \"Dozhd\", a channel which reported extensively on the deaths, was attacked the same month in central Moscow, sustaining a fractured skull and concussion. Timur Kuashev, a journalist for \"Dosh\" magazine and human rights activist, openly criticized the invasion of Eastern Ukraine as well as abuses by security services in southern Russia. On 1 August 2014 he was kidnapped in Nalchik and killed by unknown perpetrators.\n"}

They are among the earliest settlers of Sarawak. They speak in the Melanau language, which is part of North Bornean branch of Malayo-Polynesian languages. In 2010, there are estimated to be 123,410 who consider themselves Melanau, making it the fifth largest ethnic group in Sarawak (after Iban, Chinese, Malays and Bidayuh). Even though a minority in Sarawak, Melanau forms a large part of Sarawak's political sphere, 5 out of 6 of Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak is of Melanau ethnicity including the current Yang di-Pertua Tun Pehin Sri Abdul Taib Mahmud and 2 out of 5 of Chief Ministers of Sarawak are ethnic Melanau.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Melanaus settled in scattered communities along the main tributaries of the Rajang River in Central Sarawak. Melanau or problematic Kajang speaking tribes such as the Sekapan, the Rajang, the Tanjung and the Kanowit gradually moved and assimilated into Dayak migrations settling in the Rajang. The Melanau people were regarded as a sub-group of the purported Klemantan people.\n\nToday the Punan (or Punan Bah) people are also closely linked to the last riverine dwelling Melanau communities previously inhabiting the middle and upper Rejang tributaries. The Kajang language is kept relatively alive by the isolated Sekapan communities Kapit division of Sarawak.\n\nThe Melanau are considered among the earliest settlers in Sarawak. The name Melanau was not used by the Melanau to refer to themselves until recently. They call themselves \"a-likou\" meaning 'people of the river'. Legend has it that the name Melanau was given by the Malays of Brunei to the inhabitants of the coastal swamp flats and riverbanks of central Sarawak which might signifies \"coast-dweller\".\n\nEda Green, writing in 1909, referred to \"... the Milanes, whose girls are as fair as any Europeans and the belles of Borneo.\"\n\nGrouping-wise, the Melanaus can be classified into the following;\n\nThe largest group is the Matu-Daro Each group has its own characteristic dialect, but they all share the same cultural and linguistic background. An exception is the Melanau Bintulu dialect, which can hardly be understood by speakers of other dialects and is thought by many linguists to hardly fit into the Melanau language grouping. This tribe is also known as \"Vaie\" whose language is very similar to Punan Lovuk Pandan and Punan Bah. Their early establishment were from Lavang and Segan riverine areas.\nThe Melanau languages have been divided in the following five groups\n\nAnother Melanau group worth mentioning and inclusion is the Melanau Igan. They live in kampungs by the Igan River, e.g. Kampung Skrang, Kampung Tengah, Kampung Hilir, that border the Mukah - (Matu-Daro) district. The main language is Melanau. However some speak a local Malay dialect. This group of Melanau is probably all Muslim. They have mainly adopted Malay culture, while preserving some aspects of Melanau culture. It is believed that this group was originally Malays who settled in the area. However, intermarriage with Melanaus over many generations produced new generations who considered themselves Melanau.\n\nSimilar to the Igan Melanaus ancestral beginnings, many Melanaus who had migrated to different areas in Sarawak experienced the same transformation. A group of Matu Melanaus settled in Bintawa area in Kuching after World War 2. However their offspring, even though mostly Melanaus by blood, normally do not speak the language. They are considered as Malays. However, as a point of interest, the new secondary school built in Bintawa Kuching in 2007 is named SMK Matu Baru. Many areas in Kuching notably Petra Jaya, Lundu and Santubong do have a significant Melanau population. Miri, Bintulu and Sibu are also places where there is a significant Melanau population.\n\nHowever the 'Bin' which mean \"son of\" and 'Binti', meaning \"daughter of\" factors in all their names (be they are Muslim, Christian or \"Likou\") had probably confused the census workers (read the following paragraph). One of the reasons the Muslim Melanau 'migrated' to become Malay is that during the registration of birth of the newborns, they will automatically being assumed as Malay if the parents don't inform the birth and death registration officer of their racial preference.\n\nThe Melanau were traditionally fishermen as well as padi and sago farmers. Some were skilled boat builders. They used to live in tall stilt and long houses, but nowadays, they live in Malaysian kampung-style houses (individual & separated houses). Because of religious similarity, the majority of Melanaus live socially and culturally like the rest of the Malays in Malaysia.\n\nThe Melanau are one of the rare ethnic groups in Malaysia to have a population that remains more or less constant in numbers. This is because the Muslim Melanaus that have migrated to bigger towns in Sarawak have \"automatically\" become \"Malays\" especially during the National Census Operation as their names (and many times the language the elders use with their children at homes) are indistinguishable from those of the local Sarawak Malays. This has helped the Malay population of Sarawak to have significantly increased in the census.\n\nMost Melanaus have a 'Bin' (son of) and 'Binti' (daughter of) in their names similar to the Malays and it is also likely that the Christian Melanaus too were designated as Malays in the census.\n\nThe 2010 Malaysian Population Census showed the Melanaus population in Sarawak, Malaysia was about 123,410. They make up the 5th largest ethnic group in Sarawak, after the Ibans, Chinese, Malays and Bidayuh. The continuous inter-marriage between the Melanau and other races in Malaysia has also caused the disappearance of the Melanau identity. Data from some private research estimated that the actual Melanau population (in Malaysia and outside Malaysia) is much higher.\n\nBeing migrants in the early days, Melanaus are found almost everywhere in Sarawak. Sadly, though their children know their roots, many of them cannot speak or even understand their Melanau language. Intentionally or unintentionally, many of them have registered themselves as other races, mostly as Malays. In some cases, their parents, both Melanaus, prefer to speak Malay or English to their children. This language trend is mainly found in the towns and cities in Sarawak. There have been little efforts done to preserve the Melanau dialects and to teach the current Melanau generation continuous usage of their own dialects.\n\nThe gradual disappearance of the Melanau cultures and dialects is further aggravated by the absence of qualified Melanau staff members handling the documentation on the Melanau culture and history in the 'Majlis Adat Istiadat' department in Sarawak. This department is involved in the preservation and documentation of the cultures and histories of the various ethnic groups in Sarawak. The Melanau are slowly being absorbed into other cultural groups. The Melanau Kaul festival will only serve as a reminder of the Melanau Pagan ritual.\n\nWhile originally animists, the majority of the Melanaus are now Muslim, although some of them, especially among the Melanau Mukah, and Dalat are Christian. Nonetheless, many still celebrate traditional rites such as the annual Kaul Festival. Despite their different beliefs and religions, the Melanaus, like other East Malaysians (Sabah and Sarawak) are very tolerant of each other and are proud of their tolerance. One can still come across a Melanau family with different children in the family embracing Christianity and Islam while their parents still have strong animist beliefs.\n\nThe Melanaus have unique food such as jungle ferns, \"umai\", fresh fish products and \"siet\", (edible sago palm weevil larva). There is a variety of sago-based dishes such as the \"\", sago balls and the famous \"tebaloi\", also known as sago and coconut biscuits. \n\nThe Melanau have their own calendar which begins in March. The New Year is celebrated during the Kaul Festival.\n"}

The Cagadocs migrated to Canada the same year for job opportunities.\n\nIn April 2006, schoolteacher Martine Bertrand, who was assigned a role of school lunchroom monitor at École Lalande, sanctioned the then seven-year old Luc on ten separate occasions for what the school called \"disgusting\" and \"piggish\" eating habits: using a fork to push his food onto a spoon before eating it. The school board countered that the boy was punished only for disruptive behavior. The boy's mother pursued a formal apology and reported that school principal Normand Bergeron told her in a telephone conversation that in Canada, one should eat with Canadian manners \"(\"Madame, you are in Canada. Here in Canada you should eat the way Canadians eat.\")\" \n\nThe story first appeared in the \"West Island Chronicle\". According to the Montreal-area newspaper, when his mother, Theresa Gallardo Cagadoc, questioned Bergeron about punishing students for their table habits, Bergeron replied that Luc must be moved to another table if he continues to \"eat like a pig\" as it was their manner of how they discipline students.\n\nIn a \"Chronicle\" article, Bergeron expanded on his comments, claiming that the Luc was sometimes disruptive, which was the reason for his sactions and not his fork and spoon habits:\n\n[In my conversation with (the mother)] I said, \"Here, this is not the manner in which we eat.\" ...\nI don't necessarily want students to eat with one hand or with only one instrument, I want them to eat intelligently at the table ... I want them to eat correctly with respect for others who are eating with them. That's all I ask. Personally, I don’t have any problems with it, but it is not the way you see people eat every day. I have never seen somebody eat with a spoon and a fork at the same time.\nLater reporting alleged that the Luc was warned that he was tardy at the table, and so he reverted to the spoon-feeding method to save time. Luc said that he was separated from his lunchmates any time he ate that way.\n\nBergeron was subsequently restrained from speaking on the issue by the school board; spokesperson Brigitte Gavreau stated that board policy was that students could eat with any utensils.\n\nA score of protestors outside the Canadian Embassy in Manila appealed for \"respect for cultural diversity\" and affirmed \"we eat with a spoon and we're proud.\" The item was quickly picked up worldwide, especially in Filipino newspapers and websites.\n\nA security guard was assigned to the primary school, a police cruiser went on duty, and the school principal received a death threat. Fo Niemi, the Cagadocs' lawyer and the executive director for the Center for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR), had to actively discourage people from the Filipino community from protesting in front of the school board.\n\nFrance Pilon, the assistant director of the school board, said that Luc's parents were repeatedly invited to meet with school officials, but declined, reportedly on legal advice. Pilon also said that Luc's parents have instructed him to eat apart from other students.\n\nThe case was brought to the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal for formal mediation. In the meantime, Luc was transferred to a different elementary school.\n\nIn 2008 the Quebec Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission ruled that Bertrand's reprimand was an isolated incident, and found no evidence that Bergeron was biased. It found that Luc was disciplined for unsafe eating behavior, not for his cutlery etiquette.\n\nThe commission concluded that Luc was clowning around by stuffing a large amount of rice into his mouth, and that the reprimand was for his own safety. The commission concluded that it was discriminatory for Bertrand to have asked Luc if people in \"his country\" washed their hands before eating.\n\nIn November 2008 it was reported that CRARR had asked the Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission to review its decision, alleging anomalies in process that possibly prejudiced the commission's decision. The principal's newspaper comments were allegedly ignored. Theresa said that the human rights commission had interviewed representatives from the school board, but not Cagadocs. Theresa was reportedly considering an appeal to the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body, while members of the area Filipino community wanted to take the case to court.\n\nIn April 2010 the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal mandated that the school reimburse the Cagadocs CDN $17,000 in moral and punitive damages. The Tribunal stated that the school principal shared blame for not implementing an intercultural education policy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2399444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2399444", "title": "Night market", "text": "Night market\n\nNight markets or night bazaars are street markets which operate at night and are generally dedicated to more leisurely strolling, shopping, and eating than more businesslike day markets. They are typically open-air markets.\n\nThe concept of the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang government put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), night markets played a central role in Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business districts and red light districts.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, migrant urban workers made up a large base of night markets' customers. The vendors created simplified versions of banquet dishes and served xiaochi foods. The names of the towns came from the dishes they served. The serving of xiaochi foods attracted Taiwan's local elite. Stories were formed of how well-known politicians and intellectuals visited Night Market stalls.\n\nNight markets started to embody the local and the global modern popular culture because of commercial industries. Because of the global recession in the 1970s, canceled imports created more opportunities for vendors selling light industry and family made goods. This was due to more products becoming available to local markets. Night marketing networks were formed and sold Taiwan's light industry goods.\n\nBecause of the prosperity of the night markets, some traditional businesses were replaced by higher quality garment and shoe stores in the 1980s. The energetic night markets were known during this period where neon signs, loud music and light displays were used to attract customers. The new replaced the old; cafeterias instead of restaurants, gift shops instead of sundry shops, sportswear outlets instead of low quality garment stores. At Taiwan's stock market surge, chains started opening franchises that were located in or near the night markets. These included fast food outlets such as McDonald's and convenience stores such as 7-Elevens, which were then followed by garment stores. This transformation continued in the 1990s, when chains who sold higher grade merchandise replaced individually owned businesses.\n\nNight Markets changed from places that sold traditional snack food and handicrafts to modern centers of popular culture. Markets rapidly responded to new trends by producing their own versions of popular goods, especially in the 1990s, when copyright and intellectual property laws were only loosely enforced. These counterfeit items that now flooded the market attracted young customers. In recent years, these laws are now more strictly enforced so counterfeit items are usually found in traveling night markets. The night markets are now known for not personifying Taiwan as it once did. The night market was transformed to accommodate to the modern capitalist economies of present day.\n\nNight markets are popular in Chinese culture; they are especially common in East and Southeast Asia, found in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, as well as Overseas Chinese communities across Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia to the Philippines. Nevertheless, night markets are more prominent within ethnic Chinese economic and cultural activities. Some well-known night markets exist in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Bangkok, but they also exist in Chinatowns worldwide.\n\nTaiwan hosts numerous night markets in each of its major cities. The larger and more formal of these markets might take place in purpose-built marketplaces while smaller or more informal ones tend to occupy streets or roads that are normal thoroughfares by day. The temporal night markets (ones that are not housed in any permanent structure) are actually consistent in their location; in most large cities, they are on a smaller street parallel and close (a block or two away) to the primary street of that city. Though the temporal night market stalls appear at night and then vanish by day, the vendors usually return to the same location the next evening. Night markets do not close, but the individual stalls may randomly take days off due to holidays, family illness, etc. Most temporal stalls within a night market have white canvas tops and bright lights. This gives the temporary night markets a fantastical, carnival-like atmosphere.\nWhen a new night market street develops, the initial response is not always positive - they are thought to be noisy and the customers often leave trash behind that the owners of the daytime stores must deal with. As the night market becomes more well known, however, often it is looked upon more positively and the daytime stores adjust. The daytime stores then stay open later, because there are now customers at night when previously there wouldn't be. Night markets can increase profitability and often bring secondary type of consumers that are different from the daytime consumers. For example, a daytime store may normally sell herbs. At night, that same daytime store may now change its wares to include iced grass jelly and honey tea; this second item caters towards the teenage and early-twenties crowd, which is the majority of night market customers. Although some of these markets are specialized (e.g., in certain types of food), most have a mixture of individual stalls hawking clothing, consumer goods, \"xiaochi\" (snacks or fast food), and specialty drinks. The atmosphere is usually crowded and noisy with hawkers shouting and fast-paced music playing over loudspeakers. Some individual vendors may take advantage of the informality of the market to offer counterfeit, pirated or grey market consumer goods. The night markets usually open around 6pm, and are busy until past midnight.\n\nMajor night markets often have agreements and contracts where the vendors pitch in for utilities such as electricity and water hook-up. A few (such as Shilin Night Market) actually include the cost of basic cleaning in this price. There is also a greater police presence at major night markets, compared to the temporary night markets.\n\nNight markets are commonly known as \"Pasar Malam\" by the locals, which literally means \"night market\", \"pasar\" being related to \"bazaar\" in Persian or also the meaning \"market\" in Malay/Indonesian, and \"malam\" meaning \"night\". A pasar malam is a street market in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore that opens in the evening, usually in residential neighbourhoods.\n\nIt brings together a collection of stalls that usually sell goods such as fruit, vegetables, snacks, toys, clothes, movie discs and ornaments at cheap or at least reasonable prices. A pasar malam often takes place only one to a few days of the week, as the traders rotate around different neighbourhoods on different days of the week. Haggling over prices is a common practice at such markets.\n\nToday, several \"kecamatan\" (district) in Jakarta and also other provinces in Indonesia, hold weekly \"pasar malam\", usually held every Saturday night in nearby \"alun-alun\" square, open fields or marketplaces. In Indonesia, pasar malam has become a weekly recreational place for local families. Other than selling variety of goods and foods, some \"pasar malam\" also offer kiddy rides and carnival games, such as mini carousel or mini train ride.\n\nNight markets are also hosted in various areas of North America, particularly with large Overseas Chinese communities in the Pacific Northwest and the West Coast, with Taiwanese-American student organizations hosting annual night market events to emulate the jovial atmosphere and celebrate the unique culture of night markets. In San Francisco's Chinatown, a large night market with almost 100 booths takes place every autumn Saturday in Portsmouth Square. In Chinatown in Vancouver, British Columbia, large night markets take place every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from May to September, as well as in an industrial area near suburban Richmond, BC's Golden Village; the Richmond Night Market features more than 400 booths and attracts in excess of 30,000 people per night (total attendance in 2005 was almost two million). Night It Up! (formerly Toronto Night Market and Asian Night Market), has been and continues to be Power Unit Youth Organization's flagship project, attracting hundreds of thousands to a three-day celebration of Asian food and culture in Markham, Ontario (attendance was over 130,000 in 2017). The 626 Night Market, held at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, is stated to be the largest Asian night market in the United States. The Food Trust in Philadelphia operates a unique variant of a night market, with it being a temporary event only active for one night before moving somewhere else in the city; the market has thus far been held in East Passyunk, South Street, Northern Liberties, Mount Airy, Old City, Chinatown, and other places across the city. The Queens Night Market is held in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in New York City on Saturdays from April to October. It hosts as many as 100 vendors. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2427324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2427324", "title": "Nuclear power phase-out", "text": "Nuclear power phase-out\n\nA nuclear power phase-out is the discontinuation of usage of nuclear power for energy production. Often initiated because of concerns about nuclear power, phase-outs usually include shutting down nuclear power plants and looking towards fossil fuels and renewable energy. \nThree nuclear accidents have influenced the discontinuation of nuclear power: the 1979 Three Mile Island partial nuclear meltdown in the United States, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the USSR, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.\nAs of 2018, Italy is the only country that operated nuclear reactors but has since phased out nuclear power completely.\n\nFollowing the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022. Italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear. Switzerland and Spain have banned the construction of new reactors. Japan’s prime minister has called for a dramatic reduction in Japan’s reliance on nuclear power. Taiwan’s president did the same. Shinzō Abe, the prime minister of Japan since December 2012, announced a plan to re-start some of the 54 Japanese nuclear power plants (NPPs) and to continue some NPP sites under construction.\n\nAs of 2016, countries including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, and Portugal have no nuclear power stations and remain opposed to nuclear power. Belgium, Germany, Spain and Switzerland are phasing-out nuclear power.\nGlobally, more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased.\n\nItaly is the only country that has permanently closed all of its functioning nuclear plants. Lithuania and Kazakhstan have shut down their only nuclear plants, but plan to build new ones to replace them, while Armenia shut down its only nuclear plant but subsequently restarted it. Austria never used its first nuclear plant that was completely built. Due to financial, political and technical reasons Cuba, Libya, North Korea and Poland never completed the construction of their first nuclear plants (although North Korea and Poland plan to). Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ghana, Ireland, Kuwait, Oman, Peru, Singapore, Venezuela have planned, but not constructed their first nuclear plants. Between 2005 and 2015 the global production of nuclear power declined by 0.7%.\n\nA popular movement against nuclear power has gained strength in the Western world, based on concerns about more nuclear accidents and concerns about nuclear waste. Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity. The 1979 Three Mile Island accident and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster played a key role in stopping new plant construction in many countries. Major anti-nuclear power groups include Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, and Sortir du nucléaire (France).\n\nSeveral countries, especially European countries, have abandoned the construction of new of nuclear power plants. Austria (1978), Sweden (1980) and Italy (1987) voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power, while opposition in Ireland prevented a nuclear program there. Countries that have no nuclear plants and have restricted new plant constructions comprise Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Norway. Poland stopped the construction of a plant. Belgium, Germany, Spain, and Sweden decided not to build new plants or intend to phase out nuclear power, although still mostly relying on nuclear energy.\n\nNew reactors under construction in Finland and France, which were meant to lead a nuclear new build, have been substantially delayed and are running over-budget. However, China has 27 new reactors under construction, and there are also new reactors being built in Belarus, Brazil, India, Japan, Pakistan, Russia, Slovakia, South Korea, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States of America. At least 100 older and smaller reactors will \"most probably be closed over the next 10-15 years\".\n\nCountries that wish to shut down nuclear power plants must find alternatives for electricity generation; otherwise, they are forced to become dependent on imports. Therefore, the discussion of a future for nuclear energy is intertwined with discussions about fossil fuels or an energy transition to renewable energy.\n\nA nuclear power station was built during the 1970s at Zwentendorf, Austria, but its start-up was prevented by a popular vote in 1978. On 9 July 1997, the Austrian Parliament voted unanimously to maintain the country's anti-nuclear policy.\n\nBelgium's nuclear phase-out legislation was agreed in July 1999 by the Liberals (VLD and MR), the Socialists (SP.A and PS) and the Greens party (Groen! and Ecolo). The phase-out law calls for each of Belgium's seven reactors to close after 40 years of operation with no new reactors built subsequently. When the law was being passed, it was speculated it would be overturned again as soon as an administration without the Greens was in power.\n\nIn the federal election in May 2003, there was an electoral threshold of 5% for the first time. Therefore, the Green parties \nthe ECOLO got only 3.06% of the votes. , so ECOLO got no seat in the Chamber of Representatives. In July 2003, Guy Verhofstadt formed his second government. It was a continuation of the Verhofstadt I Government but without the Green parties.\nIn September 2005, the government decided to partially overturn the previous decision, extending the phase-out period for another 20 years, with possible further extensions.\n\nIn July 2005, the Federal Planning Bureau published a new report, which stated that oil and other fossil fuels generate 90% of Belgian energy use, while nuclear power accounts for 9% and renewable energy for 1%. Electricity only amounts to 16% of total energy use, and while nuclear-powered electricity amounts to 9% of use in Belgium, in many parts of Belgium, especially in Flanders, it makes up more than 50% of the electricity provided to households and businesses. This was one of the major reasons to revert the earlier phase-out, since it was impossible to provide more than 50% of the electricity by 'alternative' energy-production, and a revert to the classical coal-driven electricity would mean inability to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nIn August 2005, French SUEZ offered to buy the Belgian Electrabel, which runs nuclear power stations. At the end of 2005, Suez had some 98.5% of all Electrabel shares. Beginning 2006, Suez and Gaz de France announced a merger.\n\nAfter the federal election in June 2007, a political crisis began and lasted until the end of 2011.\n\nIn the 2010–2011 Belgian government formation negotiations, the phase-out was emphasized again, with concrete plans to shut off three of the country's seven reactors by 2015.\n\nBefore the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the plan of the government was for all nuclear power stations to shut down by 2025. Although intermediate deadlines have been missed or pushed back, on 30 March 2018 the Belgian Council of Ministers confirmed the 2025 phase-out date and stated draft legislation would be brought forward later in the year.\n\nIn 2000, the First Schröder cabinet, consisting of the SPD and Alliance '90/The Greens, officially announced its intention to phase out the use of nuclear energy. The power plants in Stade and in Obrigheim were turned off on 14 November 2003, and 11 May 2005, respectively. The plants' dismantling was scheduled to begin in 2007.\n\nThe year 2000 Renewable Energy Sources Act provided for a feed-in tariff in support of renewable energy. The German government, declaring climate protection as a key policy issue, announced a carbon dioxide reduction target by the year 2005 compared to 1990 by 25%. In 1998, the use of renewables in Germany reached 284 PJ of primary energy demand, which corresponded to 5% of the total electricity demand. By 2010, the German government wanted to reach 10%.; in fact, 17% were reached (2011: 20%, 2015: 30%).\n\nAnti-nuclear activists have argued the German government had been supportive of nuclear power by providing financial guarantees for energy providers. Also it has been pointed out, there were, as yet, no plans for the final storage of nuclear waste. By tightening safety regulations and increasing taxation, a faster end to nuclear power could have been forced. A gradual closing down of nuclear power plants had come along with concessions in questions of safety for the population with transport of nuclear waste throughout Germany. This latter point has been disagreed with by the Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety.\n\nIn 2005, Critics of a phase-out in Germany argued that the power output from the nuclear power stations will not be adequately compensated and predict an energy crisis. They also predicted that only coal-powered plants could compensate for nuclear power and CO emissions would increase tremendously (with the use of oil and fossils). Energy would have to be imported from France's nuclear power facilities or Russian natural gas. \nNumerous factors, including progress in wind turbine technology and photovoltaics, reduced the need for conventional alternatives.\n\nIn 2011, Deutsche Bank analysts concluded that \"the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways\". There were many anti-nuclear protests and, on 29 May 2011, Merkel's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by December 2022. Following the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors.\nGalvanised by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, first anniversary anti-nuclear demonstrations were held in Germany in March 2012. Organisers say more than 50,000 people in six regions took part.\n\nThe German \"Energiewende\" designates a significant change in energy policy from 2010. The term encompasses a transition by Germany to a low carbon, environmentally sound, reliable, and affordable energy supply.\nOn 6 June 2011, following Fukushima, the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy.\n\nIn September 2011, German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The company’s chairman, Peter Löscher, said that \"Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades\". Also in September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster \"caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power\".\n\nA 2016 study shows that after the nuclear phaseout, the security of electricity supply in Germany stayed at the same high level compared to other European countries and even improved in 2014. The study was conducted near the halfway point of the phaseout, 9plants having been shut and a further 8 still in operation.\n\nIn early-October 2016, Swedish electric power company Vattenfall began litigation against the German government for its 2011 decision to accelerate the phase-out of nuclear power. Hearing are taking place at the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in Washington DC and Vattenfall is claiming almost €4.7billion in damages. The German government has called the action \"inadmissible and unfounded\". These proceedings were ongoing in December 2016, despite Vattenfall commencing civil litigation within Germany.\n\nOn 5December 2016, the Federal Constitutional Court (\"\") ruled that the nuclear plant operators affected by the accelerated phase-out of nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster are eligible for \"adequate\" compensation. The court found that the nuclear exit was essentially constitutional but that the utilities are entitled to damages for the \"good faith\" investments they made in 2010. The utilities can now sue the German government under civil law. E.ON, RWE, and Vattenfall are expected to seek a total of €19billion under separate suits. Six cases were registered with courts in Germany, .\n\nNuclear power phase-out commenced in Italy in 1987, one year after the Chernobyl accident. Following a referendum in that year, Italy's four nuclear power plants were closed down, the last in 1990. A moratorium on the construction of new plants, originally in effect from 1987 until 1993, has since been extended indefinitely.\n\nIn recent years, Italy has been an importer of nuclear-generated electricity, and its largest electricity utility Enel S.p.A. has been investing in reactors in both France and Slovakia to provide this electricity in the future, and also in the development of the EPR technology.\n\nIn October 2005, there was a seminar sponsored by the government about the possibility of reviving Italian nuclear power. The fourth cabinet led by Silvio Berlusconi tried to implement a new nuclear plan but a referendum held in June 2011 stopped any project.\n\nIn the Philippines, in 2004, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo outlined her energy policy. She wants to increase indigenous oil and gas reserves through exploration, develop alternative energy resources, enforce the development of natural gas as a fuel and coco diesel as alternative fuel, and build partnerships with Saudi Arabia, Asian countries, China and Russia. She also made public plans to convert the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant into a gas-powered facility.\n\nIn 2017, responding to widespread public concerns after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, the high earthquake risk in South Korea, and a 2013 nuclear scandal involving the use of counterfeit parts, the new government of President Moon Jae-in has decided to gradually phase out nuclear power in South Korea. The three reactors currently under construction will be completed, but the government has decided these will be the last built, and as the existing plants close at a 40 years end-of-life they will be replaced with other modes of generation.\n\nA year after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 the Swedish nuclear power referendum, 1980 was held. It led to the Swedish parliament deciding that no further nuclear power plants should be built, and that a nuclear power phase-out should be completed by 2010. On 5 February 2009, the Government of Sweden effectively ended the phase-out policy. In 2010, Parliament approved for new reactors to replace existing ones.\n\nThe nuclear reactors at the Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant were shut down between 1999 and 2005. In October 2015, corporations running the nuclear plants decided to phase out two reactors at Oskarshamn and two at Ringhals, reducing the number of remaining reactors from 12 in 1999 to 6 in 2020.\n\nAn opinion poll in April 2016 showed that about half of Swedes want to phase out nuclear power, 30 percent want its use continued, and 20 percent are undecided. Prior to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, \"a clear majority of Swedes\" had been in favour of nuclear power. In June 2016 the opposition parties and the government reached an agreement on Swedish nuclear power. The agreement is to phase out the output tax on nuclear power, and allow ten new replacement reactors to be built at current nuclear plants.\n\n, the five operational Swiss nuclear reactors were Beznau 1 and 2, Gösgen, Leibstadt, and Mühleberg—all located in the German speaking part of the country. Nuclear power accounted for 36.4% of the national electricity generation, while 57.9% came from hydroelectricity. The remaining 5.7% was generated by other conventional and non-hydro renewable power stations.\n\nOn 25 May 2011, the Federal Council decided on a slow phase-out by not extending running times or building new power plants. The first power plant, Mühleberg, will stop running in 2019, the last in 2034.\n\nThere have been many Swiss referenda on the topic of nuclear energy, beginning in 1979 with a citizens' initiative for nuclear safety, which was rejected. In 1984, there was a vote on an initiative \"for a future without further nuclear power stations\" with the result being a 55 to 45% vote against. On 23 September 1990, Switzerland had two more referenda about nuclear power. The initiative \"stop the construction of nuclear power stations\", which proposed a ten-year moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants, was passed with 54.5% to 45.5%. The initiative for a phase-out was rejected with by 53% to 47.1%. In 2000, there was a vote on a green tax for support of solar energy. It was rejected by 67–31%. On 18 May 2003, there were two referenda: \"Electricity without Nuclear\", asking for a decision on a nuclear power phase-out, and \"Moratorium Plus\", for an extension of the earlier-decided moratorium on the construction of new nuclear power plants. Both were turned down. The results were: Moratorium Plus: 41.6% Yes, 58.4% No; Electricity without Nuclear: 33.7% Yes, 66.3% No.\n\nThe program of the \"Electricity without Nuclear\" petition was to shut down all nuclear power stations by 2033, starting with Unit 1 and 2 of Beznau nuclear power stations, Mühleberg in 2005, Gösgen in 2009, and Leibstadt in 2014. \"Moratorium Plus\" was for an extension of the moratorium for another ten years, and additionally a condition to stop the present reactors after 40 years of operation. In order to extend the 40 years by ten more years, another referendum would have to be held (at high administrative costs). The rejection of the Moratorium Plus had come as a surprise to many, as opinion polls before the referendum had showed acceptance. Reasons for the rejections in both cases were seen as the worsened economic situation.\n\nIn Spain a moratorium was enacted by the socialist government in 1983 and in 2006 plans for a phase-out of seven reactors were being discussed anew.\n\nIn Ireland, a nuclear power plant was first proposed in 1968. It was to be built during the 1970s at Carnsore Point in County Wexford. The plan called for first one, then ultimately four plants to be built at the site, but it was dropped after strong opposition from environmental groups, and Ireland has remained without nuclear power since. Despite opposing nuclear power (and nuclear fuel reprocessing at Sellafield), Ireland is to open an interconnector to the mainland UK to buy electricity, which is, in some part, the product of nuclear power.\n\nSlovenian nuclear plant in Krško (co-owned with Croatia) is scheduled to be closed by 2023, and there are no plans to build further nuclear plants. The debate on whether and when to close the Krško plant was somewhat intensified after the 2005/06 winter energy crisis. In May 2006 the Ljubljana-based daily \"Dnevnik\" claimed Slovenian government officials internally proposed adding a new 1000 MW block into Krško after the year 2020.\n\nGreece operates only a single small nuclear reactor in the Greek National Physics Research Laboratory in Demokritus Laboratories for research purposes.\n\nThe future of nuclear power in the United Kingdom is currently under review. The country has a number of reactors which are currently reaching the end of their working life, and it is currently undecided how they will be replaced. The UK is also currently failing to reach its targets for reduction on CO emissions, which situation may be made worse if new nuclear power stations are not built. The UK also uses a large proportion of gas-fired power stations, which produce half the CO emissions as coal, but there have been recent difficulties in obtaining adequate gas supplies. In 2016 the UK government committed to support the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station.\n\nIn the Netherlands, in 1994, the Dutch parliament voted to phase out after a discussion of nuclear waste management. The power station at Dodewaard was shut down in 1997. In 1997 the government decided to end Borssele's operating license, at the end of 2003. In 2003 the shut-down was postponed by the government to 2013. In 2005 the decision was reversed and research in expanding nuclear power has been initiated. Reversal was preceded by the publication of the Christian Democratic Appeal's report on sustainable energy. Other coalition parties then conceded. In 2006 the government decided that Borssele will remain open until 2033, if it can comply with the highest safety standards. The owners, Essent and DELTA will invest 500 million euro in sustainable energy, together with the government, money which the government claims otherwise should have been paid to the plants owners as compensation.\n\nNew Zealand enacted the \"New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987\" which prohibits the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of New Zealand and the entry into New Zealand waters of nuclear armed or propelled ships. This Act of Parliament, however, does not prevent the construction of nuclear power plants.\n\nIn Australia there are no nuclear power plants. Australia has very extensive, low-cost coal reserves and substantial natural gas and majority political opinion is still opposed to domestic nuclear power on both environmental and economic grounds.\n\nRenewable energy, mainly hydropower, is gaining share.\n\nFor North Korea, two PWRs at Kumho were under construction until that was suspended in November 2003. On 19 September 2005 North Korea pledged to stop building nuclear weapons and agreed to international inspections in return for energy aid, which may include one or more light water reactors – the agreement said \"The other parties expressed their respect and agreed to discuss at an appropriate time the subject of the provision of light-water reactor\" [sic].\n\nIn July 2000, the Turkish government decided not to build four reactors at the controversial Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, but later changed its mind. The official launch ceremony took place in April 2015, and the first unit is expected to be completed in 2020.\n\nTaiwan has 3 active plants and 6 reactors. Active seismic faults run across the island, and some environmentalists argue Taiwan is unsuited for nuclear plants. Construction of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant using the ABWR design has encountered public opposition and a host of delays, and in April 2014 the government decided to halt construction. Construction will be halted from July 2015 to 2017 in order to allow time for a referendum to be held. The 2016 election was won by a government with stated policies that included phasing out nuclear power generation.\n\nIndia has 20 reactors operating, 6 reactors under construction, and is planning an additional 24.\n\nVietnam had developed detailed plans for 2 nuclear power plants with 8 reactors, but in November 2016 decided to abandon nuclear power plans as they were \"not economically viable because of other cheaper sources of power.\"\n\nOnce a nuclear proponent, Prime Minister Naoto Kan became increasingly anti-nuclear following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. In May 2011, he closed the aging Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant over earthquake and tsunami fears, and said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. In July 2011, Kan said that \"Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy ... saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology\". In August 2011, the Japanese government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from renewable energy sources. A 2011 Japanese Cabinet energy white paper says \"public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged\" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power. , the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is still leaking low levels of radioactivity and areas surrounding it could remain uninhabitable for decades.\n\nBy March 2012, one year after the disaster, all but two of Japan's nuclear reactors were shut down; some were damaged by the quake and tsunami. The following year, the last two were taken off-line. Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments, and in all cases local opposition prevented restarting.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, reelected on a platform of restarting nuclear power, plans to have nuclear power account for 20 to 22 percent of the country’s total electricity supply by 2030, compared with roughly 30 percent before the disaster at the Fukushima complex.\n\nIn 2015 two reactors at Sendai nuclear power plant have been restarted. In 2016 Ikata-3 restarted and in 2017 Takahama-4 restarted.\n\nThe United States is, as of 2013, undergoing a practical phase-out independent of stated goals and continued official support. This is not due to concerns about the source or anti-nuclear groups, but due to the rapidly falling prices of natural gas and the reluctance of investors to provide funding for long-term projects when short term profitability of turbine power is available.\n\nThrough the 2000s a number of factors led to greatly increased interest in new nuclear reactors, including rising demand, new lower-cost reactor designs, and concerns about global climate change. By 2009, about 30 new reactors were planned, and a large number of existing reactors had applied for upgrades to increase their output. In total, 39 reactors have had their licences renewed, three Early Site Permits have been applied for, and three consortiums have applied for Combined Construction-Operating Licences under the \"Nuclear Power 2010 Program\". In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 contains incentives to further expand nuclear power.\n\nHowever, by 2012 the vast majority of these plans were cancelled, and several additional cancellations followed in 2013. Currently only five new reactors are under construction, and one, at Watts Bar, was originally planned in the 1970s and only under construction now. Construction of the new AP1000 design is underway at two locations in the United States in Georgia and South Carolina. Plans for additional reactors in Florida were cancelled in 2013.\n\nSome smaller reactors operating in deregulated markets have become uneconomic to operate and maintain, due to competition from generators using low priced natural gas, and may be retired early. The 556 MWe Kewaunee Power Station is being closed 20 years before license expiry for these economic reasons. Duke Energy's Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant in Florida closed, as it could not recover the costs needed to fix its containment building.\n\nAs a result of these changes, after reaching peak production in 2007, US nuclear capacity has been undergoing constant reduction every year.\n\nIn Brazil, nuclear energy, produced by two reactors at Angra, accounts for about 4% of the country's electricity – about 13 TWh per year. Angra III is under construction and due to come online in 2018. Brazil plans to build seven more reactors by 2025.\n\nIn Argentina, about 6% of the electricity comes from 3 operational reactors: The \"Embalse\" plant, a CANDU6 reactor, the \"Atucha 1\" plant, a PHWR German design, and the \"Atucha 2\" plant, also a PHWR German design.\nArgentina also has some other research reactors, and exports nuclear technology.\n\nThe nuclear power debate is about the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes. The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, when it \"reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies\", in some countries.\n\nProponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source which reduces carbon emissions and can increase energy security if its use supplants a dependence on imported fuels. Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel. Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course to achieve energy independence for most Western countries. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors, and the operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants.\n\nOpponents say that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment. These threats include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, and there have been many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.\n\nThe economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multi-billion dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. Nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs (with much of the costs of fuel extraction, processing, use and long term storage externalized). Therefore, comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants. Cost estimates also need to take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage costs. On the other hand measures to mitigate global warming, such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, may favor the economics of nuclear power versus fossil fuels.\nIn recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks. In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out. Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.\n\nAnalysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties. To date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies where many of the risks associated with construction costs, operating performance, fuel price, and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers. Many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks, and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered, are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants.\nFollowing the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants, due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats.\n\nThe environmental impact of nuclear power results from the nuclear fuel cycle, operation, and the effects of nuclear accidents.\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear fission power are small relative to those associated with coal, oil, gas, and biomass. They are about equal to those associated with wind and hydroelectric.\n\nThe routine health risks from nuclear fission power are very small relative to those associated with coal, oil, gas, solar, biomass, wind and hydroelectric.\n\nHowever, there is a \"catastrophic risk\" potential if containment fails, which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by over-heated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment. The public is sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable public opposition to nuclear power. Even so, in comparing the fatalities for major accidents alone in the energy sector it is still found that the risks associated with nuclear power are extremely small relative to those associated with coal, oil, gas and hydroelectric. For the operation of a 1000-MWe nuclear power plant the complete nuclear fuel cycle, from mining to reactor operation to waste disposal, the radiation dose is cited as 136 person-rem/year, the dose is 490 person-rem/year for an equivalent coal-fired power plant.\n\nThe 1979 Three Mile Island accident and 1986 Chernobyl disaster, along with high construction costs, ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity. A further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 Japanese tsunami which damaged the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns classified as a Level 7 event. The large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a 20 km exclusion zone set up around the power plant, similar to the 30 km radius Chernobyl Exclusion Zone still in effect.\n\nThe effect of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate practically since the first nuclear reactors were constructed. It has also been a key factor in public concern about nuclear facilities. Some technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimize the amount of radioactivity released to the environment have been adopted. Despite the use of such measures, human error remains, and \"there have been many accidents with varying effects as well near misses and incidents\".\nBenjamin K. Sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants. Fifty-seven accidents have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and 57% (56 out of 99) of all nuclear-related accidents have occurred in the USA. Serious nuclear power plant accidents include the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), Chernobyl disaster (1986), Three Mile Island accident (1979), and the SL-1 accident (1961). Stuart Arm states, \"apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident.\"\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency maintains a website reporting recent accidents.\n\nNuclear safety and security covers the actions taken to prevent nuclear and radiation accidents or to limit their consequences. This covers nuclear power plants as well as all other nuclear facilities, the transportation of nuclear materials, and the use and storage of nuclear materials for medical, power, industry, and military uses.\n\nAlthough there is no way to guarantee that a reactor will always be designed, built and operated safely, the nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed safer reactor designs, though many of these designs have yet to be tested at industrial or commercial scales. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.\n\nAn interdisciplinary team from MIT have estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005 – 2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period. To date, there have been five serious accidents (core damage) in the world since 1970 (one at Three Mile Island in 1979; one at Chernobyl in 1986; and three at Fukushima-Daiichi in 2011), corresponding to the beginning of the operation of generation II reactors. This leads to on average one serious accident happening every eight years worldwide. Despite these accidents, the safety record of nuclear power, in terms of lives lost (ignoring nonfatal illnesses) per unit of electricity delivered, is better than every other major source of power in the world, and on par with solar and wind.\n\nThe Energy transition is the shift by several countries to sustainable economies by means of renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development. This trend has been augmented by diversifying electricity generation and allowing homes and businesses with solar panels on their rooftops to sell electricity to the grid. In the future this could \"lead to a majority of our energy coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country\" rather than large power plants. The final goal of German proponents of a nuclear power phase-out is the abolishment of coal and other non-renewable energy sources.\n\nRenewable energy encompasses wind, biomass (such as landfill gas and sewage gas), hydropower, solar power (thermal and photovoltaic), geothermal, and ocean power. These renewable sources serve as alternatives to conventional power generation from thermal power stations run on nuclear or fossil fuels.\nA significant part of energy transition is reducing consumption by energy conservation and improvements in energy efficiency, an example is improved insulation for buildings; or improved energy efficiency by cogeneration of heat and power. Smart meters are able to charge higher prices at the time consumption peaks during the day, thereby causing electricity demand to drop slightly when the price increases.\n\nIssues exist that currently prevent a shift over to a 100% renewable technologies. There is debate over the environmental impact of solar power, and the environmental impact of wind power. Some argue that the pollution produced and requirement of rare earth elements offsets many of the benefits compared to other alternative power sources such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power. According to the 2013 \"Post Carbon Pathways\" report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints. However, according to a research paper published in 2014, renewable energy by itself, will not be able to stop climate change.\n\nGoogle spent $30 million on their RE<C project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050. \nCurrent developments towards a 100% renewable energy policy require solutions to low storage capacity, low energy density, and high cost.\n\n\n\n"}

Both are split in numerous and highly divergent dialects. They, along with Hungarian, comprise the Ugric branch of the Uralic languages.\n\nThe languages are spoken in the region between the Urals and the Ob River and the Irtysh in central Russia. The forests and forest steppes of the southern Urals are thought to be the original homeland of the Ugric branch. Beginning some 500 years ago the arrival of the Russians pushed the speakers eastward to the Ob and Irtysh. Some Mansi speakers remained west of the Urals until as late as the early 20th century. Hungarian split off during the 11th century BC.\n\nThe status of the Ob-Ugric languages as a close areal grouping is clear, with adjacent varieties regularly sharing isoglosses and having loaned vocabulary back and forth (as well as from common external sources, e.g. from eastern dialects of Komi into northern dialects of Mansi and Khanty). This effect is particularly clear between the more eastern and northern varieties of Mansi, and the more western varieties of Khanty. Modern-day Northern Mansi and Northern Khanty continue to affect each other's evolution. Some areal similarities are also shared with their eastern Samoyedic relatives, in particular between Khanty and Selkup, but also Forest Nenets.\nThe relationship to Hungarian is looser: in their current state, the Ob-Ugric languages are radically different from Hungarian in phonology, syntax, and vocabulary.\n\nTypological features distinguishing the Ob-Ugric languages include:\n\nThe Ob-Ugric languages have also been strongly influenced by nearby Turkic languages, especially Tatar.\n\nMansi has about 1,000 speakers while Khanty has about 10,000 speakers, all within Russia. Until 1930, these languages had no written or literary traditions, but since 1937 have used a modified Cyrillic alphabet. However, no significant texts have been created in these languages and they have few official usages.\n\nThe existence of a common Ob-Ugric period after the separation from Hungarian and the rest of Uralic is not universally accepted: some linguists treat all common features of Mansi and Khanty as either later convergence under mutual influence, or retentions from the common Ugric and earlier periods.\n"}

Experimentation was prevalent in British art at the time.\n\nThe main figures were Graham Bell, William Coldstream, Edgar Hubert, Rodrigo Moynihan and Geoffrey Tibble.\n\nThe movement was short-lived lasting only a few years. Many of the artists involved went on to be part of the realist Euston Road School.\n\nWilliam Townsend told the Tate Gallery that 'the style originated with Geoffrey Tibble in the latter half of 1933. It was immediately taken up by Rodrigo Moynihan [...] and at the same time or shortly after by Edgar Hubert'. According to Townsend, early paintings by the group were derived from external objects but they became increasingly abstract.\n\nThe more abstract paintings, that came to represent the movements style, were created using improvised freely applied brushstrokes. Geoffrey Tibble described them as 'not abstracted from nature, and which made no reference to and had no associations with anything outside themselves [...] the picture was an object in its own right' (Bowness, 1960:198).\n\nIn 1934, the exhibition \"Objective Abstractions\" was held at the Zwemmer Gallery showing the group's work, except Hubert's. The exhibition also included work by more representational artists, Ivon Hitchens, Victor Pasmore, and Ceri Richards.\n"}
{"id": "9291245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9291245", "title": "Pandemic severity index", "text": "Pandemic severity index\n\nThe pandemic severity index (PSI) is a proposed classification scale for reporting the severity of influenza pandemics in the United States. The PSI was accompanied by a set of guidelines intended to help communicate appropriate actions for communities to follow in potential pandemic situations. Released by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on 1 February 2007, the PSI was designed to resemble the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale classification scheme.\n\nThe PSI was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a new pandemic influenza planning tool for use by states, communities, businesses and schools, as part of a drive to provide more specific community-level prevention measures. Although designed for domestic implementation, the HHS has not ruled out sharing the index and guidelines with interested international parties.\n\nThe index and guidelines were developed by applying principles of epidemiology to data from the history of the last three major flu pandemics and seasonal flu transmission, mathematical models, and input from experts and citizen focus groups. Many \"tried and true\" practices were combined together in a more structured manner:-\n\nDuring the onset of a growing pandemic, local communities cannot rely upon widespread availability of antiviral drugs and vaccines (See Influenza research).\nThe goal of the index is to provide guidance as to what measures various organizations can enact that will slow down the progression of a pandemic, easing the burden of stress upon community resources while definite solutions, like drugs and vaccines, can be brought to bear on the situation. The CDC expects adoption of the PSI will allow early co-ordinated use of community mitigation measures to affect pandemic progression.\n\nThe index focuses less on how likely a disease will spread worldwide – that is, become a pandemic – and more upon how severe the epidemic actually is.\nThe main criterion used to measure pandemic severity will be case-fatality ratio (CFR), the percentage of deaths out of the total reported cases of the disease.\n\nThe actual implementation of PSI alerts is expected to occur after the World Health Organization (WHO) announces phase 6 influenza transmission (human to human) in the United States. This would probably result in immediate announcement of a PSI level 3–4 situation.\n\nThe analogy of \"category\" levels were introduced to provide an understandable connection to hurricane classification schemes, with specific reference to the recent aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\nLike the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, the PSI ranges from 1 to 5, with Category 1 pandemics being most mild (equivalent to seasonal flu) and level 5 being reserved for the most severe \"worst-case\" scenario pandemics (such as the 1918 Spanish flu).\n\nThe report recommends four primary social distancing measures for slowing down a pandemic:\n\nThese actions, when implemented, can have an overall effect of reducing the number of new cases of the disease; but they can carry potentially adverse consequences in terms of community and social disruption. The measures should have the most noticeable impact if implemented uniformly by organizations and governments across the US.\n\nWhile unveiling the PSI, Dr. Martin Cetron, Director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, reported that early feedback to the idea of a pandemic classification scale has been \"uniformly positive\".\n\nThe University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) reports that the PSI has been \"drawing generally high marks from public health officials and others, but they say the plan spells a massive workload for local planners\". One MD praised that the PSI were \"a big improvement over the previous guidance\"; while historical influenza expert and author John M. Barry was more critical of the PSI, saying not enough emphasis was placed on basic health principles that could have an impact at the community level, adding \"I'd feel a lot more comfortable with a lot more research [supporting them]\".\n\nDuring the initial press releases in 2007, the CDC acknowledge that the PSI and the accompanying guidelines were a work in progress and will likely undergo revision in the months following their release.\n\n"}

Named after Arctic explorers and Bowdoin College graduates Robert E. Peary (Class of 1877) and Donald B. MacMillan (Class of 1898), it is one of two museums in the United States dedicated completely to Arctic Studies.\n\nBowdoin College’s historic relationship with the Arctic dates back to 1860, when a group of Bowdoin students accompanied one professor on a research trip to Labrador and West Greenland. Peary and MacMillan made many trips to the Arctic, together and separately. Bowdoin students also accompanied MacMillan on several expeditions in the early-to-mid-20th century. To this day, professors and students of the college continue to travel to the Arctic to pursue research.\n\nThe Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum was made possible by generous donations from the Class of 1925, George B. Knox (Class of 1929), and other alumni and friends. The Museum was dedicated in 1967, and MacMillan attended the opening that same year.\n\nEstablished in 1985, the Arctic Studies Center links the resources of the museum and the library with teaching and research efforts, and hosts lectures, workshops, and educational outreach projects. \"Through course offerings, field research programs, employment opportunities, and special events, the Arctic Studies Center promotes anthropological, archaeological, geological, and environmental investigations of the North.\"\n\nThe Arctic Museum's exhibitions focus on different aspects of the Arctic, ranging from natural life, such as plants and animals, to cultural life of people native to the Arctic region. Artifacts in the Museum's collection include Peary and MacMillan's expedition equipment, anthropologic objects, Inuit art, films, archival papers, publications, and natural history specimens. The Museum's exhibitions now change approximately every two years to show as much of the collection as possible.\n\nThe exhibition 'Imagination Takes Shape' will be on display through December 2011. The exhibition is a collection of Canadian Inuit sculpture and prints from the Robert and Judith Toll Collection.\n\nBowdoin College's Departments of Sociology, Anthropology, and Geology offer a concentration in Arctic Studies. These departments, together with the Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum, provide students with opportunities to explore cultural, social, and environmental issues involving Arctic lands and peoples. The Director of the Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum & Arctic Studies Center is Susan A. Kaplan, Associate Professor of Anthropology.\n\nThe Peary–MacMillan Arctic Museum is open Tuesday – Saturday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, and on Sundays from 2:00 pm – 5:00 pm. The Museum is closed on Mondays and on national holidays. \nAdmission is free, and donations are accepted. School and group tours may be arranged.\n\n\n"}

In early 20th century among the majority of the Slavs in the region of Macedonia coexisted pro-Bulgarian ethnic sentiments and regional Macedonian identity. The partition of the Ottoman Macedonia between Balkan nation-states after the conclusion of the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the area divided mainly between Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia). As result part of the Slav inhabitants of the region emigrated to Bulgarian Macedonia. Under Serbian control in Vardar Macedonia the locals faced with the policy of forced Serbianisation. The Greek governments also began promulgating a policy of persecution of the use of Slavic dialects both in public and in private, as well of expressions of any ethnic distinctiveness. In 1919 and 1927 population exchange agreements were signed and the bulk of the Slavic-speaking population in Greece left for Bulgaria. In this way the \"Bulgarian community\" in most of the area began to reduce, either by population exchanges or by change of its ethnic identity.\n\nIn June 1931 the registrar of the Comintern Otto Kuusinen in his report on the national question to the Executive Committee, suggested that the main weakness of the Comintern was the insufficient appreciation of the national questions. Kuusinen called to discuss the national question in order to develop a new national program for each of the parties. Meanwhile, to the Balkan communist parties a directive was provided, for the gradual abandonment of the slogan of the Balkan Federation, highlighting in its foreground the \"right of the distinct peoples of self-determination to a full separation\". The reason for this political turning, was the rising of Nazism in Germany. Thus in 1932 a members of the Comintern sponsored IMRO (United), put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation. This question was discussed among them, however, there was a split when Vasil Hadzhikimov and his group, refused to agree that the Macedonians are a separate people from the Bulgarians. Nevertheless, the highest institutions of the Comintern were informed about this issue from Dino Kyosev who gave a lecture in Moscow in 1933 on the distinct Macedonian national consciousness.\n\nAs result in the autumn of 1933 the Macedonian Dimitar Vlahov - leader of the IMRO (United) and former Bulgarian diplomat, was summoned in Moscow and took part in a number of meetings. At one of them the Executive Committee ordered the leading cadres of the Balkan Secretariate, Valecki - a Pole, and Šmeral - a Czech, to draw up a special resolution on the issue. Because they had no concept of this problem, using Vlahov's help the resolution yet had been prepared. Vlahov claims, before the convening of the consultation the leadership had already its stand that the Macedonian nation exists. So on January 11, 1934, the Political Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Comintern adopted its final decision on the Macedonian Question about the existence of a Macedonian nation. The basis of the new concept was the common view that the region of Macedonia is one of the pivots of future imperialist war and therefore the Comintern seeks an option to blunt the contradictions between the countries that possess it. This decision by the Comintern was the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation. According to Vlahov, that was precisely what happened in Moscow in 1934:\n\n\"I mentioned earlier that the Comintern itself wanted the Macedonian Question to be considered at one of the consultations of its executive committee. One day I was informed that the consultation would be held. And so it was. Before the convening of the consultation, the inner leadership of the committee had already reached its stand, including the question of Macedonian nation, and charged the Balkan Secretariat with the drafting of corresponding resolution... In the resolution, which we published in the Makedonsko Delo in 1934, it was concluded that the Macedonian nation exists\".\n\nHe also mentioned that the resolution had a hostile reception both from members of the Bulgarian Communist Party and of the IMRO (United), residing in Moskow. Vlahov himself was a member of both organizations and a Soviet spy, who declared himself until then as a Bulgarian. He accepted the decision without any personal reaction or substantive comment, that confirms he was operating in fact as a Communist agent. However, the Resolution didn't ever mention the ineffectual Vlahov as a leader of the IMRO (United). The Resolution was published for the first time in the April issue of the IMRO (United) magazine \"Makedonsko Delo\". Following the decision of the Comintern, IMRO (United) took as its slogan \"the right of the Macedonian people to self-determination up to secession\" and formation of \"Macedonian Republic of working masses\". Despite the fact that this was formally a Resolution of IMRO (United), it was a document adopted by the Comintern, which was immediately published in all the mouthpieces of this international communist centre. Afterwards the mainstream Bulgarian public opinion has maintained that the Comintern is the \"inventor\" of the idea about the existence of a separate Macedonian nation.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, this views on the Macedonian issue had been of little practical importance. During the War the macedonist ideas were further developed by the Yugoslav Communist Partisans, although some researchers doubt that even at that time the Macedonian Slavs identified themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians. After the Red Army entered the Balkans in the late 1944, new communist regimes came into power in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia and their policy on the Macedonian Question was committed to the Resolution of supporting the development of a distinct ethnic Macedonian identity. A separate Macedonian language also was codified in 1945.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55615", "title": "School uniform", "text": "School uniform\n\nA school uniform is a uniform worn by students primarily for a school or otherwise educational institution. They are common in primary and secondary schools in various countries. Although often used interchangeably, there is an important distinction between dress codes and school uniforms: according to scholars such as Nathan Joseph, clothing can only be considered a uniform when it \"(a) serves as a group emblem, (b) certifies an institution's legitimacy by revealing individual’s relative positions and (c) suppresses individuality.\" An example of a uniform would be requiring white button-downs and ties for boys and pleated skirts for girls, with both wearing blazers. A uniform can even be as simple as requiring collared shirts, or restricting colour choices and limiting items students are allowed to wear. A dress code, on the other hand, is much less restrictive, and focuses \"on promoting modesty and discouraging anti-social fashion statements\", according to Marian Wilde. Examples of a dress code would be not allowing ripped clothing, no logos or limiting the amount of skin that can be shown.\n\nIt is not difficult to trace the origins of the uniform as there is no comprehensive written history, but rather a variety of known influences. School uniforms are believed to be a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom. It is believed that the Christ Hospital School in London in 1552 was the first school to use a school uniform. Students were given a uniform that most notably consisted of a long blue coat and yellow, knee-high socks. An almost identitical uniform is still worn by students attending the school today. The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the then Archbishop of Canterbury ordered the wearing of the cappa clausa.\nThis monastic and academic practice evolved into collegiate uniforms in England, particularly in charity schools where uniform dress was often provided for poor children. Universities, primary schools and secondary schools used uniforms as a marker of class and status. Although school uniforms can often be considered conservative and old-fashioned, uniforms in recent years have changed as societal dress codes have changed.\n\nIn the United States, a movement toward using uniforms in state schools began when Bill Clinton addressed it in the 1996 State of the Union, saying: \"If it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear uniforms.\" As of 1998 approximately 25% of all U.S. public elementary, middle and junior high schools had adopted a uniform policy or were considering a policy, and two thirds were implemented between 1995 and 1997.\n\nThere are an abundance of theories and empirical studies looking at school uniforms, making statements about their effectiveness. These theories and studies elaborate on the benefits and also the shortcomings of uniform policies. The issue of nature vs. nurture comes into play, as uniforms affect the perceptions of masculinity and femininity, complicate the issue of gender classification and also subdue the sexuality of girls. With uniforms also comes a variety of controversies, pros, cons and major legal implications.\n\nThere are two main empirical findings that are most often cited in the political rhetoric surrounding the uniform debate. One of these, the case study of the Long Beach Unified School District, is most often cited in support of school uniforms and their effectiveness whereas \"Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement\" is the most frequently cited research in opposition to the implementation of school uniform policies.\n\nThe case study of the Long Beach Unified School District was the study of the first large, urban school in the United States to implement a uniform policy. In 1994, mandatory school uniforms were implemented for the districts elementary and middle schools as a strategy to address the students' behaviour issues. The district simultaneously implemented a longitudinal study to research the effects of the uniforms on student behavior. The study attributed favourable student behavioral changes and a significant drop in school discipline issues to the mandatory uniform policy. This case study attributed the following noticeable outcomes to the use of uniforms throughout the district:\nOther research found that uniforms were not an effective deterrent to decrease truancy, did not decrease behavior problems, decrease substance use, or increase student achievement.\n\nA study suggested that \"instead of directly affecting specific outcomes, uniforms act as a catalyst for change and provide a highly visible opportunity for additional programs\" within schools. In fact, Brunsma et al., 1998 considered that this was the case with the Long Beach Unified School District case study as several additional reform efforts were implemented simultaneously with the mandatory uniform policy.\n\nBrunsma stated that despite the inconclusiveness of the effects of uniforms, they became more common because \"this is an issue of children's rights, of social control, and one related to increasing racial, class and gender inequalities in our schools.\"\n\nAs uniforms have become more normalised, there have also been an increasing number of lawsuits brought against school districts. According to David Brunsma, one in four public elementary schools and one in eight public middle and high schools in the USA have policies dictating what a student wears to school. The school code within states’ constitutions typically asserts that it allows the board of school directors to make reasonable rules and regulations as they see fit in managing the school’s affairs. As of 2008, there are currently 23 states that allow school districts to mandate school uniforms. The constitutional objections usually brought upon school districts tend to fall into one of the following two categories: (1) a violation of the students’ First Amendment right to free expression (2) a violation of parents' right to raise their children without government interference. Although up until this point, The Supreme Court has not ruled on a case involving school uniforms directly, in the 1968 decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the Court ruled that upon entering school, students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech.\n\nInternationally, there are differing views of school uniforms. In the Australian state of Queensland, Ombudsman Fred Albietz ruled in 1998 that state schools may not require uniforms. In the Philippines, the Department of Education abolished the requirement of school uniforms in public schools. In England and Wales, technically a state school may not permanently exclude students for \"breaching school uniform policy\", under a policy promulgated by the Department for Children, Schools and Families but students not wearing the correct uniform are asked to go home and change. In Scotland, some local councils (that have responsibility for delivering state education) do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities. Turkey abolished mandatory uniforms in 2010.\n\nIn the \"Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board\" lawsuit in 2000, a Louisiana district court ruled in favour of the school board because it did not see how the free speech rights of the students were being violated due to the school board's uniform policy. Even though the plaintiff appealed the decision, the Fifth Circuit Court also ruled in favour of the school board after implementing a four-step system that is still used today. Firstly, a school board has to have the right to set up a policy. Secondly, the policy must be determined to support a fundamental interest of the board as a whole. Thirdly, the guidelines cannot have been set for the purpose of censorship. Finally, the limits on student expression cannot be greater than the interest of the board. As long as these four policies are in place, then no constitutional violation can be claimed.\n\nIn the Forney Independent School District of Forney, Texas in 2001, the school board decided to implement a school uniform policy allowing the students to wear a polo shirt, oxford shirt or blouse in four possible colours, and blue or khaki pants or shirts, a skirt or jumper. While there was some flexibility with shoes, certain types were prohibited along with any sort of baggy clothes. The parents of the Littlefield family requested that their son be exempt from the policy, but were denied. In response, the Littlefields filed a lawsuit against the school district, under the pretenses that this uniform mandate infringed on their rights as parents to control how they brought up their children and their education. They even went as far as to cite an infringement on religious freedom, claiming that opting out of the uniforms on the grounds of religion allowed the school to rank the validity of certain religions. Before trial, the District Court dismissed the case, so the family appealed. Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the students' rights were not being violated even though the claims presented were valid. They ruled that school rules derived from the education would override the parents' right to control their children's upbringing in this specific situation. As far as the religious freedom violation accusations, the court ruled that the policy did not have a religious goal, and thus did not infringe on religious freedom rights.\n\nIn 2003, Liberty High School, a school of the Clark County School District in Henderson, Nevada, implemented a uniform policy of khakis and red, white or blue polo shirts. A junior by the name of Kimberly Jacobs was suspended a total of five times because she wore a religious shirt to school and got cited for uniform violations. Her family sued the Clark County School District under the claims that her First Amendment rights were being infringed upon and that the uniform policy was causing students to be deprived of due process. The plaintiff's requests were for injunctive relief, the expunging of suspensions from Jacob's school record and awarding of damages. The injunction was granted to the family meaning that the school could no longer discipline her for breaking the uniform policy. At this ruling, the school district appealed. The next court ruled on the side of the school district as it determined that the uniform policy was in fact neutral and constitutional, and it dismissed the claims of the plaintiff.\n\nIn 2011, a Nevada public elementary school of the Washoe County School District decided to add the school's motto, \"Tomorrow's Leaders\" embroidered in small letters on the shirt. In response, Mary and John Frudden, parents of a student sued the school district on the basis of it violating the 1st Amendment. The court ultimately dismissed the case filed by the Fruddens over the uniforms. However, the family appealed, and two years later, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case. The court ruled to reverse the previous decision of dismissing the case, and also questioned the apparent policy for students that were part of a nationally recognised group such as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who were able to wear the uniforms in place of the school ones on regular meeting days. The 9th circuit panel ruled that the school had not provided enough evidence for why it instituted this policy, and that the family was never given a chance to argue.\n\nThere are several positive and negative social implications of uniforms on both the students wearing them and society as a whole.\n\nOne of the criticisms of uniforms is that it imposes standards of masculinity and femininity from a young age. Uniforms are considered a form of discipline that schools use to control student behavior and often promote conventional gendered dress. Boys often are required to wear trousers, belts, and closed-toe shoes and have their shirts tucked in at all times. They are also often required to have their hair cut short. Some critics allege that this uniform is associated with the dress of a professional business man, which, they claim, gives boys at a young age the impression that masculinity is gained through business success. For girls, some uniforms promote femininity by requiring girls to wear skirts. Skirts are seen by some critics as a symbol of femininity because they restrict movement and force certain ways of sitting and playing. Uniforms that include an apron for girls may suggest that the appropriate feminine societal role is a primarily domestic one. Some girls' school uniforms have been criticized as having an uncomfortable design, which prevents girls from free movement and exposes girls to cold during winter.\n\nUniforms often start to increase in popularity around middle school in the United States, when students begin going through puberty. Uniforms can be seen as a way to restrict the sexualization of girls (rules on hems of skirts, no shoulders). Uniforms take the focus away from sexuality and focus it on academics in a school setting for girls.\n\nSometimes the desire to prevent overtly sexualized clothing through uniforms can fail, as uniforms, especially those that include skirts, can have the opposite effects, as in Japan or South Korea. Miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they became part of school uniforms, and they came to be worn within the Kogal culture.\n\nIn some cultures, the topic of school uniforms has sparked a multitude of controversies and debates over the years. Debates concerning the constitutionality and economic feasibility of uniforms also contribute to the controversy.\n\nIn the United States, the implementation of school uniforms began following ten years of research indicating the effectiveness of private schools. Some state-school reformers cited this research to support policies linked to private and Catholic school success. However, within the Catholic school literature, school uniforms have never been acknowledged as a primary factor in producing a Catholic school effect. Some public-school administrators began implementing uniform policies to improve the overall school environment and academic achievement of the students. This is based on the assumption that uniforms are the direct cause of behavioral and academic outcome changes.\n\nAnother area of controversy regarding school uniform and dress code policies revolve around the issue of gender. Nowadays, more teenagers are more frequently \"dressing to articulate, or confound gender identity and sexual orientation\", which brings about \"responses from school officials that ranged from indifferences to applause to bans\". In 2009, there were multiple conflicts across the United States arising from disparities between the students' perception of their own gender, and the school administrators' perception of the students' gender identity. Instances include the following:\nAlthough not all schools in the United States are required to wear school uniforms, the United States is slowly adapting the use of school uniforms. \"Almost one in five US public schools required students to wear uniforms during the 2011-2012 school year, up from one in eight in 2003-2004.\" The ideology of school uniform is that it will create a safer environment for students and help with equality. In some areas uniforms have become essential due to the poverty level that the schools reside in. \"Mandatory uniform policies in public schools are found more commonly in high-poverty areas.\"\n\nStephanie Northen of \"The Guardian\" wrote that school uniforms are less controversial in the United Kingdom compared to the United States and are usually not opposed on free speech grounds.\n\nAdvocates of uniforms have proposed multiple reasons supporting their implementation and claiming their success in schools. A variety of these claims have no research supporting them. Some of these pros include the following:\nAdvocates believe that uniforms affect student safety by:\nKathleen Wade conducted an experiment to see if bullying and gang presence was higher in uniform or non-uniform schools. The research was done with multiple schools where she gave a questionnaire to both students, and faculty to see if there was a significant difference. Her results showed that bullying and gang presence significantly decreases with students wearing school uniforms. \n\nFor example, in the first year of the mandatory uniform policy in Long Beach, California, officials reported that fighting in schools decreased by more than 50%, assault and battery by 34%, sex offenses by 74%, and robbery by 66%. \nAdvocates also believe that uniforms increase student learning and positive attitudes toward school through:\n\nWearing uniforms leads to decreased behavior problems by increasing attendance rates, lowering suspension rates, and decreasing substance use among the student body. Proponents also attribute positive psychological outcomes like increased self-esteem, increased spirit, and reinforced feelings of oneness among students to wearing uniforms. Additional proponent arguments include that school uniforms:\n\nCurrently pros of school uniforms center around how uniforms affect schools' environments. Proponents have found a significant positive impact on school climate, safety, and students’ self-perception from the implementation of uniforms.\n\nThe opposing side of uniforms have claimed their ineffectiveness using a variety of justifications, a variety of which have research supporting them. Some of the cons to school uniforms include the following legal, financial, and questionable effectiveness concerns: The primary concern with school uniforms or strict dress codes is that it limits the ability of students to express themselves. Clothing is viewed as a mean of expression – making all students wear the same clothes or limit them to what they can wear can disrupt their sense of identity. One of the main controversies can lie within Dress Code Policies vs. Freedom of Speech. This establishes that students cannot wear the latest trends, mid-drift, or clothes that the school finds that interrupts the learning environment. However, students can wear clothing artifacts that express their religion. \"Both the Constitution and most state laws protect students' rights to wear religious attire inool [\"sic\"] school, such as the wearing of a turban, yarmulke, or head scarf.\"\n\nAnother negative aspect of school uniforms is that it can be sexist. Boys and girls are not disciplined the same when it comes to dress codes. \"Transgender students have been sent home for wearing clothing different from what’s expected of their legal sex, while others have been excluded from yearbooks.\" Some schools are not advocates of females and females dressing of the opposite sex. Research on how school uniforms and school dress codes influence the student can be inconclusive, but many people oppose to school uniforms and strict dress code policies. \"In the U.S., over half of public schools have a dress code, which frequently outline gender-specific policies.\"\n\nAccording to Marian Wilde, additional opponent arguments include that school uniforms:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14891167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14891167", "title": "South African Arms Deal", "text": "South African Arms Deal\n\nThe Strategic Defence Package or the Strategic Defence Acquisition, popularly referred to as the Arms Deal was a South African military procurement programme. It involved a US$4.8 billion (R30 billion in 1999 rands) purchase of weaponry by the African National Congress government led by Nelson Mandela in 1999. It has been subject to repeated, seemingly substantive, allegations of corruption.\n\nThe South African Department of Defence's Strategic Defence Acquisition aimed to modernise its defence equipment, which included the purchase of corvettes, submarines, light utility helicopters, lead-in fighter trainers and advanced light fighter aircraft.\n\nThe South African government announced in November 1998 that it intended to purchase 28 BAE/SAAB JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft from Sweden at a cost of R10.875 billion, i.e. R388 million (about US$65 million) per plane.\n\nThe Arms Deal was plagued by accusations of corruption and in 2011 President Zuma announced a commission of enquiry \"into allegations of fraud, corruption, impropriety or irregularity in the Strategic Defence Procurement Packages\". The Commission was chaired by Judge Seriti, a judge of the Supreme Court of Appeal and became known as the Seriti Commission.\n\nIn a January 2001 report, the Attorney-General of the Western Cape and the SIU's own senior legal advisor recommended further investigation:\n\nA joint investigative team looked at the arms deal in 2000. This team consisted of the auditor general, the public defender and the national director of public prosecution. Their published November 2001 report stated that there were no grounds to believe that the government had acted \"illegally or improperly\".\n\nBut, in October 2009, documents provided by Cape Town businessman Richard Young, whose company, CCII Systems, lost the tender for the navy's new corvettes, showed their initial report had been doctored, factual bases had been removed and its conclusions changed.\n\nBritish and German investigators suspect that bribes of over one billion rand were paid to facilitate the deal. Jacob Zuma, Thabo Mbeki, Schabir Shaik and his brother Chippy Shaik, Fana Hlongwane have been mentioned. In March 2003, Tony Yengeni was convicted of defrauding parliament by accepting a bribe while handling the deal. He was sentenced to four years in prison. Andrew Feinstein, an ANC Member of Parliament and the former African National Congress leader of Parliament's public accounts watchdog Scopa, resigned when the party moved to curtail investigations into the arms deal. He wrote a book called \"After the Party\" with an insider's view of the process.\n\nWhistleblower Patricia de Lille alleged in Parliament that she had evidence of three payments by warship supplier Thyssen-Krupp on 29 January 1999, each of R500,000, to the ANC, to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and to the Community Development Foundation, a Mozambique charity associated with Mandela's wife, Graça Machel.\n\nSweden's Channel 4 investigative programme Kalla Fakta (Cold Facts) uncovered Stefan Löfven's role – a former head of the Swedish industrial union IF Metall. In 1999 Löfven was the head of Metall's international section and a good friend of Moses Mayekiso, the former general secretary of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa). Numsa and the South African National Civics Organisation (SANCO) announced their joint support for the Saab Gripen bid. Mayekiso had by then left Numsa to lead Sanco, though he remained influential within the union. Saab would support Numsa in establishing an Industrial School, supported by Metall and another big Swedish union. They allege that R30 million for the school was in reality a bribe for South African politicians.\n\nIn his book Feinstein alleges:\n\n\nFeinstein points out that this is the same sum under investigation by the German authorities, in relation to an amount allegedly solicited by South Africa's former chief of acquisitions, Chippy Shaik. Shaik has denied the allegation. Feinstein also contradicts public claims by senior government figures that there was no attempt to interfere with the probe into the arms deal once Parliament had authorised a joint investigation team (JIT). He writes: \"I was told by someone from the JIT about a meeting with the president at which they… were told who they could and could not investigate.\"\n\nElsewhere he claims: \"It was made clear to investigators that a shadowy financier close to Mbeki and Zuma who has played an ongoing role in financing the ANC, was off limits.\" He notes: \"For instance, the charge sheet for the arrest of Schabir Shaik was drawn up to charge both Shaik and Zuma. When presented to Bulelani Ngcuka, he is alleged to have responded: 'I will charge the deputy president only if my president agrees.'\"\n\nRecounting how he was hauled before the party's top brass after Parliament had authorised its own investigation, Feinstein writes: \"I was given a brief opportunity to try to explain the prima facie evidence we had and the process we were following. Within a few minutes Minister in the Presidency Essop Pahad had launched into a ferocious diatribe, spluttering 'Who the fuck do you think you are, questioning the integrity of the government, the ministers and the president?'

On November 3, 1885, a mob that consisted of prominent businessmen, police, and political leaders descended on the Chinese community. The mob marched Chinese residents to a railroad station and forced them to board a train to Portland. In the following days, the structures that remained in the Chinese community were razed. The event was the result of growing anti-Chinese sentiment and violence throughout the American West.\n\nThis organized action became known as the \"Tacoma method\", and despite national and international outcry, it was used as an example of how to forcibly remove Chinese residents from cities and towns throughout the American West. The anti-Chinese sentiment in Tacoma and Washington Territory more broadly made it so that those involved did not face repercussions for their actions.\n\nThis impacted Chinese immigration to Tacoma for decades. In 1992, the Chinese Citizens Reconciliation Committee was created. In 1993, the Tacoma City Council issued a statement on the expulsion saying that it was \"a most reprehensible occurrence\". In 2005, Chinese Reconciliation Park broke ground on the Tacoma waterfront to commemorate the event.\n\nIn 1873, the Northern Pacific Railway announced plans to situate its western terminus in Tacoma. Given the experience of Chinese laborers on other major railroad projects, they were among the laborers that were hired to work on the new construction. The Northern Pacific Railway completed its Tacoma terminal on December 27, 1873. Because there was still work to be done building wharves and smaller rail lines, Chinese workers remained in the area. The Northern Pacific Railway leased the Chinese land near the train tracks which became the Tacoma Chinatown. This was located on the Tacoma waterfront near present-day Downtown Tacoma.\n\nBy the 1880s, there were approximately 1,000 Chinese residents living in Pierce County with 700 of them in Tacoma. There was a fluctuation of the numbers of Chinese residents during this time due to the lack of record keeping and the transient nature of the industries that many Chinese residents worked in. There were several Chinese owned businesses within Chinatown selling groceries and household goods, but the majority of the Chinese were employed in laundries, small stores, hotels, restaurants, and domestic work.\n\nCalifornia became the core site of early anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States beginning in the 1850s. While Chinese immigrants enjoyed a much older history in the United States, the true expansion of Chinese immigration to the United States was with the California Gold Rush in 1848. This gave poor Chinese families the hope and opportunity to raise their families. The rate of immigration was relatively small until 18,000 Chinese came to California in 1852. As they formed communities, they developed their own benevolent societies to support them in their new lives. This gave them a connection to their homeland but it also provided them job opportunities, education, recreation, medical help, and assistance in settling disputes.\n\nAs Chinese miners began to work in California's mines, tensions began to rise between European and Chinese workers. Similar animus took place once the Chinese began to branch out into other industries. Anti-Chinese sentiment was particularly strong with labor organizations in California. Denis Kearney, an Irish immigrant and one of California's most public anti-Chinese labor leaders, popularized the call of \"The Chinese Must Go!\" This rallying cry became increasingly common throughout the American West and was used in the buildup to the Chinese expulsion in Tacoma. As anti-Chinese sentiment became common in California, corresponding incidents of violence and anti-Chinese legislation occurred throughout the state. This included several riots as well as ordinances that set limits on housing and property ownership. Racial animus and new economic opportunities led Chinese immigrants to other territories, moving to other parts of the American West and Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn the following decades, anti-Chinese sentiment began to be reflected in national policy. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, and the subsequent 1892 Geary Act, were federal laws that targeted Chinese immigrants by barring all new immigration from China. Local sentiment among anti-Chinese activists in the Washington Territory was that this legislation was not being enforced, and that Chinese migrants were entering primarily from British Columbia.\n\nThroughout the 1880s, anti-Chinese incidents became increasingly common. On September 4, 1885, the Rock Springs Massacre occurred in Rock Springs, Wyoming Territory and represented one of the deadliest anti-Chinese incidents in the United States during the nineteenth century. A group of coal miners drove out hundreds of Chinese miners and killed at least 28 of them. News of this event spread nationally and internationally and led to increased friction between the Chinese consulate and the United States government. This would become one of a string of violent incidents directed towards the Chinese population in the Pacific Northwest territories.\n\nThis violence soon spread to Washington Territory. On September 7, 1885, in Squak Valley (present-day Issaquah, Washington), a group of white and Native American laborers, fired into the tents of Chinese hop pickers and killed three of them. On September 11, 1885, another instance of anti-Chinese violence occurred in the Coal Creek mines of Newcastle, Washington Territory. There, one Chinese miner was kidnapped and the barracks of several dozen Chinese workers was set on fire. On September 19, 1885 in the coal mining community of Black Diamond, Washington Territory, white miners drove the Chinese out and injured nine of them. These events spurred a flurry of organizing activity devoted to expelling the Chinese from other communities in the Washington Territory.\n\nIn February 1885, Tacoma Mayor Jacob Weisbach (a German immigrant) met with a small group of men to discuss the Chinese question. William Christie who had witnessed the Chinese expulsion that had recently occurred in Eureka, California, was among the attendees. During this meeting, they discussed the actions taken by other localities to expel their Chinese citizens and considered how they might do the same in Tacoma. This was one of the earliest recorded instances of Tacoma citizens meeting to discuss taking direct action to expel Chinese residents.\n\nOn February 21, 1885, Mayor Weisbach called a mass meeting at the Alpha Opera House to discuss methods of expelling the Chinese population of Tacoma. Roughly 900 of Tacoma's 6,936 total citizens came to the meeting. The crowd was mostly male and white, and the crowd represented nearly half of the town's electorate. A former alderman, J. E. Burns, suggested passing sanitation laws to enable the city to evict Chinese residents and burn down Chinese homes. Reverend J. A. Ward suggested that white property owners cease selling and leasing property to the Chinese community. Weisbach roused the crowd with a closing speech, stating: \"If the people are in earnest, if they are Free Americans in fact they will not yield up their homes and business to the filthy horde.\" The crowd adopted a resolution to exclude Chinese people from Tacoma and discourage citizens from employing any Chinese people. The resolution stipulated that any citizen who did not boycott Chinese employment would have their name published.\n\nHerbert Hunt stated that during 1885, \"the discussion of the [Chinese] question was constant and it figured in many business and social affairs.\" Many groups formed in 1885 in Tacoma with the express goal of expelling the Chinese community. On September 7 of 1885, a Tacoma chapter of the Knights of Labor was formed, which helped to increase hostility against Chinese residents.\n\nThe Tacoma City Council also tried to pursue expulsion through legal means, by making residence in Tacoma more difficult for the Chinese community. The council passed an ordinance at the recommendation of Mayor Weisbach stating that all sleeping rooms needed to have 500 cubic feet of air per individual.\n\nOn September 28, 1885, an \"Anti-Chinese Congress\" met in Seattle. Tacoma's Mayor Weisbach presided over the congress, which proclaimed that all Chinese people must leave Western Washington by November 1 of that year. The congress planned for \"ouster committees\" to notify the Chinese residents in the communities assembled of the expulsion date. A meeting was held at the Alpha Opera House in Tacoma on October 3 to elect the Tacoma \"ouster committee,\" which would later become known as the Committee of Fifteen. Following the meeting, members of this committee alerted members of Tacoma's Chinese community that they had to leave the city by November 1. Other anti-Chinese community members put additional pressure on white Tacomans to fire their Chinese employees.\n\nAfter this alert, much of the Chinese community left the city, with merchants and some laborers choosing to remain behind. Some members of the Tacoma community gave their assurances to Chinese residents that they would be protected and not forced to leave.\n\nA series of events occurred in the days leading up to the expulsion. On October 31, the night prior to the deadline for the Chinese residents to leave, a final rally was held. Nearly 700 people came to show support for the expulsion. As the November 1st deadline approached, an additional 150 Chinese people left the city, leaving roughly 200 Chinese people in Tacoma. The following day, November 2, those accused in the Squak Valley massacre were acquitted, leading to a feeling that those involved in anti-Chinese actions could act with relative impunity.\n\nOn the morning of November 3 at 9:30 AM, 200 to 300 white citizens of Tacoma gathered on Pacific Avenue. The mob had shortly thereafter grown to nearly 500 people. The mob marched from Seventeenth Street to Old Tacoma, stopping at each Chinese residence and business to tell the people within to pack and be ready for a wagon to come at 1:30 PM that day to take them away. They visited the homes and businesses of white citizens who had refused to fire their Chinese employees, delivering their message to them as well. The mob acted methodically and militaristically in their action to expel the Chinese population of Tacoma, and many of the men were armed with either guns or clubs.\n\nThe expulsion was often violent. Lum May, a prominent merchant who had been in Tacoma since 1875, reported in a later deposition that the mob \"broke forcibly into the houses, smashing in doors and breaking in windows.\" The wife of Lum May refused to leave and was dragged by members of the mob out of her house. May reported that: \"From the excitement, the fright, and the losses we sustained through the riot she lost her reason. She was hopelessly insane and attacked people with a hatchet or any other weapon if not watched...She was perfectly sane before the riot.\" There were only a few instances of resistance to the actions of the mob. A few Chinese residents sent telegrams to Governor Watson Squire asking for help, but he did not take any action. Some who may have intervened against the action of the mob later reported a hesitance due to the presence of the mayor, judge, multiple members of the city council, and the fire chief in the mob. When Lum May appealed to Mayor Weisbach and noted General John W. Sprague's promise of protection for the Chinese community, Weisbach retorted that \"General Sprague has nothing to say. If he says anything we will hang him or kick him.\"\n\nAt 1:30 PM, 150 to 200 members of the Chinese community were rounded up and forced to march 8 miles to the Lake View train station in a torrential downpour. A select number of Chinese merchants were granted a stay of 48 hours to pack up their business, however, for many this was not honored and they were forced to leave with the rest of the Chinese community. Upon arriving at Lake View, the expelled Chinese people were forced to buy their own train tickets to Portland. Those who could not afford tickets rode in the boxcars of a freight train or walked the 140 miles along the rail grade. While waiting for transportation, two men died of exposure.\n\nIn the ensuing days, members of the Tacoma community preceded to burn down the city's Chinatown. On November 4, three members of the Committee of Fifteen went to inspect Chinese property along the waterfront, and shortly after their departure the buildings were engulfed in flames. No attempts were made by the Tacoma Fire Department to save the buildings. Within four days of the expulsion, all physical memory of Tacoma's Chinese community had been erased by fire.\n\nThe headline of the \"Tacoma Daily Ledger\" on November 4, the day after the expulsion, read: \"Gone! Two Hundred Chinese Leave the City – How the People's Request was Enforced.\" On November 7, a ball was held by Tacoma Turnverein, the city's German society, to celebrate the actions of Mayor Weisbach and the Committee of Fifteen. That same day, Mayor Weisbach, the fire chief, and 25 others who were involved with the expulsion were indicted on felony conspiracy charges. This group would become known as the Tacoma Twenty-Seven. They were escorted to Vancouver, Washington Territory on the morning of November 9. Community members cheered on the 27 as they left, and immediately began raising money for a legal fund. Each member of the Tacoma Twenty-Seven stated that they would plead not guilty. By the 12th, the 27 had posted bail and returned to Tacoma, where they were greeted with much fanfare. The trial of the 27 had been set for the first Monday of April in 1886.\n\nThe trial stalled for a year before the original indictments were dropped on a technicality. The United States Attorney immediately presented evidence for a new trial but only 10 of the original 27 were re-indicted. These indictments were also dropped for procedural reasons. Finally, in 1887, the case was brought before a new grand jury, but in the end, no one was indicted. The men involved in the Chinese expulsion had become local heroes and would go on to dominate city politics for years afterwards.\n\nThe Chinese consulates in San Francisco and Washington D.C. were in contact with Washington Territory officials and representatives of the federal government throughout 1885. In September, Frederick Bee, representing San Francisco's Chinese consulate, exchanged messages with Governor Watson Squire over the safety of the territory's Chinese residents. Bee noted that \"Complaints are made to this consulate from your Territory that evil-disposed persons have attacked and wounded several Chinese residents, and that further violence is threatened; that, in fact, the Chinese are to be expelled from the Territory.\" Squire assured Bee that Washington officials would be vigilant about future actions.\n\nImmediately following the expulsion, Chinese consulates in Washington D.C. and San Francisco pursued legal avenues to ensuring a just resolution. On Yang Ming, the consul general in San Francisco, messaged Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard and noted that \"Several hundred Chinese driven from Tacoma...No effort made by the governor or authorities to protect them. Prompt action must be taken, or the same outrage will be enacted all over the Territory.\" The Chinese consulate continued to make the argument that the expulsion and related acts of anti-Chinese violence were a direct violation of the Burlingame Treaty.\n\nChinese officials experienced several challenges in working with the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. President Cleveland reacted to the growing anti-Chinese sentiments by strengthening the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 under the belief that cultural differences and anti-Chinese hostility made the U.S. unsafe for Chinese immigrants. In turn, the Qing government felt that the U.S. was unable or unwilling to protect Chinese citizens living in America. In August 1886, the Chinese foreign office proposed a new Sino-American treaty be drafted with the U.S. State department. On October 1, 1888, Congress passed the Scott Act which permanently banned the immigration or return of Chinese laborers to the United States. The Qing government did not recognize the legitimacy of this act.\n\nPresident Cleveland, concerned about trade relations with China following the Tacoma expulsion and other cases of anti-Chinese violence in the United States, asked Congress to pass legislation to indemnify the Chinese who suffered from riots in the Pacific states and territories. Congress authorized a payment of $276,619.75 on October 19, 1888 to China as compensation for the Tacoma expulsion and other cases of anti-Chinese violence.\n\nAfter the Tacoma expulsion, the Portland, Oregon, newspaper \"The Oregonian\" published a piece condemning the actions of Tacoma and comparing the treatment of Chinese in Tacoma to the expulsion of the Jews and Moors from Spain. The \"Seattle Chronicle\" echoed the Oregonian's concern of the treatment of the Chinese in Tacoma, and noted that two Chinese residents who were driven out of Tacoma were British citizens who appealed to the British government for redress. The Chronicle also stated that Tacoma would not be so proud of their method once its situation became an international incident. Tacoma received criticism from several newspapers on the East Coast, including The \"New York Times, New York Herald, New York Sun\" and \"New York Tribune\". The phrase \"Tacoma method\" was coined in the aftermath of the Tacoma expulsion in a piece written by Tacoma resident George Dudley Lawson in California's \"Overland Monthly\". Lawson's piece attempted to justify the expulsion which he viewed as a boon to Tacoma.\n\nDr. David Murdock moved to Tacoma in 1982 and noticed the lack of Chinese presence in the city. After learning about the 1885 expulsion of Tacoma's Chinese citizens and worried by the lack of recognition of the event, Murdoch submitted a Citizen Suggestion Award Application to the city of Tacoma on August 27, 1991. The statement suggested that \"since the eviction [of the Chinese populace] was from the Old Town waterfront, it would be appropriate to set aside an area of reconciliation (small park with a Chinese motif) and a monument acknowledging the incident, noting Tacoma's regret and desire to move ahead in unity and respect.\"\n\nOn November 30, 1993, the Tacoma City Council approved resolution number 32415 in order to formally apologize for the Chinese expulsion of 1885. In doing so, the council recognized efforts of local citizens in promoting reconciliation and endorsed the construction of a Chinese commemorative park which would be located at the former national guard site on Commencement Bay. The city council authorized $25,000 to begin the project, and the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation was founded in spring of 1994 in order to continue the process of reconciliation in the Tacoma community. The centerpiece of the foundation has been the construction of Chinese Reconciliation Park, located on the Ruston Way shoreline. The park is very close to the former Chinese settlement of Little Canton, from which residents were expelled in 1885. The park consists of a waterfront trail, the String of Pearls Bridge, and a custom pavilion that was originally constructed in China.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9413193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9413193", "title": "The Furies Collective", "text": "The Furies Collective\n\nThe Furies Collective was a communal lesbian group in Washington, D.C. that was established in the summer of 1971. The group intended to give a voice to lesbian separatism through its newspaper, \"The Furies\". In the first issue in January 1972, contributor Ginny Berson stated her view that: \n\"... Sexism is the root of all other oppressions, and Lesbian and woman oppression will not end by smashing capitalism, racism, and imperialism. Lesbianism is not a matter of sexual preference, but rather one of political choice which every woman must make if she is to become woman-identified and thereby end male supremacy.\"\nThe Furies Collective, which lived at 219 11th St SE in Washington, D.C., was, along with the Gay Liberation House and the Skyline Collective, among Washington, D.C.'s best known communal living groups in the early 1970s. They were an example of lesbian feminism which emerged in during the women's movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. The twelve women in the collective were aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all feminists, all lesbians, all European-American, with three children among them. They shared chores and clothes, held some of their money in common, and slept on mattresses on a common floor. \n\nAll of the founding members had extensive organizing and activist experience before they started The Furies. In particular, many were members of the women's movement, specifically the DCWLM (D.C. Women's Liberation Movement). The group was modeled after other revolutionary movements such as the Black Panther Party and the Weathermen. In this sense, they aimed to promote a global revolution through the establishment of small radical groups. They wanted to abolish patriarchy, white supremacy and imperialism. They were particularly devoted to developing and exploring feminist theory, especially the way in which sexual identity is socially constructed.\n\nAs part of their mission, they started a school to teach women auto and home repair so they would not be dependent on men. Members called for other feminists to create more communes wherein women could nurture their relationships with one another away from male chauvinism. Not only men, but heterosexual women were also seen as impediments to progress. \n\nMost of the members of the collective wrote for their newspaper, \"The Furies\". From January 1972 until mid-1973, the paper was published and distributed nationally.\n\nThe group promoted a model of lesbianism for all members of the women's movement, an alternative identity which combined sexual orientation, gender identity, and radical philosophy. For member Charlotte Bunch, to be a lesbian \"is to love oneself, woman, in a culture that denigrates and despises women.\" Another Furies member, Ginny Berson, commented that \"Lesbianism is not a matter of sexual preference, but rather one of political choice.\" She also stated, \"Lesbians must become feminists and fight against woman oppression, just as feminists must become Lesbians if they hope to end male supremacy.\"\n\nAccording to Rita Mae Brown in \"Rita Will\", the members of the collective were \"Rita Mae Brown, Charlotte Bunch, Tasha Byrd [sic], Ginny Berson, Sharon Deevey, Susan Hathaway, Lee Schwin [sic], Helaine Harris, Coletta Reid, Jennifer Woodull [sic], Nancy Myron and Joan E. Biren (J.E.B.)\" The names marked \"[sic]\" are actually Tasha Petersen or Peterson, Lee Schwing, and Jennifer Woodul.\n\nThe collective did not last long but its influence was felt beyond the group's end. The first two members asked to leave were Joan E. Biren and Sharon Deevey, followed shortly thereafter by Rita Mae Brown. The newsletter survived the disbanding of the collective in the spring of 1972 by about a year. \n\nOlivia Records was founded in 1973 by the group members and by the Radicalesbians. As well, the Furies' theoretical contributions to the women's movement outlasted the collective's existence. Future feminist groups across the country cited the importance of the Furies' theoretical developments of feminism to their own organizing efforts. Former members of the collective went on to other organizing and activist positions, especially in media and publishing.\n\nIn 2016 the house at 219 11th St. SE which was home to the Furies Collective was named as the first lesbian-related historic landmark in Washington, D.C. when it was unanimously voted into the D.C. Inventory of Historic Sites. Later that same year that house became the first lesbian site on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n"}

S. Lewis readers and enthusiasts. It aims to promote the discussion of all of Lewis works, exploring the themes in his writings, and celebrating Lewis' impact on today's world.\n\nAn eclectic group, tPON's almost 300 members range from grade school pupils to university professors, from all over the Philippines and from Filipino Communities in other countries.\n\nAccording to tPON founder (and current High King) Professor RE de Leon, the group was created for Filipino or Philippines-based C.S. Lewis enthusiasts, with the term \"Filipino\" referring more to cultural, rather than national or political affiliation. Thus, tPON's officers explain, the group includes members who were raised in the Philippines but have since become citizens of other countries, and foreigners who live in the Philippines.\n\nWhile named after the Chronicles of Narnia, Lewis' most famous work, the group also appreciates Lewis' other works.\n\nThe organization is a member of the New Worlds Alliance, the alliance of different science fiction and fantasy fangroups in the Philippines. However, since not all of C.S. Lewis' works involve science fiction and fantasy, the group's interests are not limited to the science fiction and fantasy aspects of Lewis' work.\n\nAccording to the group's website:\n\n\"All of CS Lewis’ works are considered within the purview of tPON. We simply use the word “\"Narnians\"” because \"Narnia\" is by far Lewis’ most popular work. For example, Till We Have Faces has easily become a group favorite – not much of a surprise because Lewis himself considered it his best work. In fact, some of the members have never read a Narnia book! They start off from some other Lewis work such as The Screwtape Letters or The Four Loves or even Perelandra!\"\n\nIn the tradition of several New Worlds Alliance (NWA) organizations, the regular tPON meetings have been named Summons. While this was initially considered the acceptable singular and plural form of the word, the current practice on the group's mailing list is to call these meetings \"Summonses\" in the plural form.\n\nDe Leon recalls that the name was suggested by Ian Roxas, then head of tPON's NWA sister group, The Philippine Tolkien Society (TPTS), during the very first Summons. (By the same tradition, TPTS' own meetings are called \"Moots\")\n\nSummonses are currently held about once every month, with the schedule decided by members' availability and announced on the group's website and mailing list.\n\nThe decision for the Summons venue is very fluid. Most of the time, tPON meets either at Mosaic Lounge, found on the 3rd floor of Greenbelt 1 building in Makati City or at Seattle's Best Coffee at the nearby Greenbelt 3 building. Some occasions call for a South (Alabang) and North (Quezon City) Summons at times. Announcements are made via the mailing list.\n\nDuring the recent release by Walden Media and Walt Disney Pictures of the cinematic version of , tPON partnered with several organizations to promote the movie in several ways.\n\nIn November 2005, tPON partnered with the British Council and Fully Booked to hold symposium on The Chronicles of Narnia. It also invited the cast of the Trumpets' stageplay version of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and the co-writer of the libretto, Luna Griño-Inocian.\n\nIn January 2006, coinciding with the Philippine release of the movie, the organization partnered with Shangri-la Mall and Radio Station Magic 89.9 to hold a Cosplay contest and a special block screening of the movie.\n\nEvery now and then, tPON participates in Costuming Events sponsored by the NWA.\n\nPreviously an NWA member, tPON had been a regular participant of the Annual Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention.\n\nStarting from five group inactive mailing list members in July 2003, tPON grew slowly at first. But when some of the members attended the A Long Expected Party: the Second Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention in 2004, things began to heat up. New members came in, exciting discussions popped up, and the Filipino C.S. Lewis community grew. Since then, the annual New Worlds convention has become a sort of time-marker for the organization, signifying steps in the organization's history.\n\nIt was in the aftermath after the convention that tPON's had its first few meetings.\n\nThe first meeting saw only four members come to a coffeeshop in Greenbelt3, Makati City. The second, which was timed to coincide with a \"moot\" of The Philippine Tolkien Society, was better attended and saw the introduction of the name \"Summons\" to distinguish tPON meetings from those of other NWA groups.\n\nIt was also at this second meeting that names for the organization were first suggested. Names like \"The CS Lewis Society of the Philippines\" and \"Filipino Narnians\" were suggested along with humorous suggestions such as \"Lamp Post Philippines\", \"The Philippine Wardrobe Society\" and \"The Lion's Club\". \"The Philippine Order of Narnians\" eventually won out, though it took almost a year before the name was officially accepted.\n\nThe Group also began meeting at Mosaic Lounge, another venue in Makati, which now serves as the meeting place of choice for tPON.\n\nIn 2005, the group was formally invited to become a participant of New Worlds Episode III: Third Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention, and had provisionally become a member of the New Worlds Alliance (NWA), the umbrella organization of Science Fiction/Fantasy Organizations who were managed the annual convention.\n\nThe last stretch of 2005 proved very hectic for tPON. From November 2005 to January 2006, the organization was busy promoting the movie adaptation of .\n\nIn July 2006, tPON took part in 'New Worlds 4: A Broken Time Machine', which marked its second full participation in a major NWA activity and qualified it to be a full member of the organization. The organization came within a hair's breadth of bagging that year's Best Booth award for its eye-catching \"Aslan's Tent\" motiff.\n\nBecause it had become a full member of the NWA, it was selected along with another NWA member, Arkham Philippines, to become part of the NWA Council as of January 13, 2007.\n\nThe NWA Council was originally composed of the seven charter groups who were present at the formation of the New Worlds Alliance in 2003. Over time, two groups become inactive and thus forfeited their place in the Council.\n\nIn October 2007, tPON did not participate in the New Worlds 5 convention due to the concern for safety brought upon by the mall blasts at the Glorietta which happened a week before the said convention.\n\nIn early 2008, tPON left the New Worlds Alliance to concentrate more on scholarly endeavors which is one of the main purposes of the group. tPON acknowledges NWA's contribution to the Filipino-Narnian community.\n\ntPON - An acronym for the group, properly characterized by a small \"t\".\n\nSummons - tPON's regular meetings\n\nHigh King - The head of the organization, currently group founder and novelist RE de Leon.\n\nKing or Queen - Officers of tPON, somewhat analogous to Vice Presidents, but with Executive power, which is not exclusive to the high king. The current King for External Affairs is Martin Badoy, the current Queen for Financial Affairs is Crissy Montes and the current Queen for Events Management is Ilia Uy.\n\nThe Order of the Lion - An informal group of regular members, consulted by the Kings and Queens regarding most of the organization's decisions.\n\nFilipino Narnian - An alternative way of referring to the group's members, this is a reference to the members' \"dual citizenship.\" The member is both a Filipino (by heart if not by Nationality) and a \"Narnian\", a citizen of Narnia.\n\nAll material from the group website, mailing list, and message board have been taken with the express permission of the organization's leaders.\n\n"}
{"id": "38853392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38853392", "title": "Urbanization in the United States", "text": "Urbanization in the United States\n\nThe urbanization of the United States has progressed throughout its entire history. Over the last two centuries, the United States of America has been transformed from a predominantly rural, agricultural nation into an urbanized, industrial one. This was largely due to the Industrial Revolution in the United States (and parts of Western Europe) in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the rapid industrialization which the United States experienced as a result. In 1790, only about one out of every twenty Americans (on average) lived in urban areas (cities), but this ratio had dramatically changed to one out of four by 1870, one out of two by 1920, two out of three in the 1960s, and four out of five in the 2000s.\n\nThe urbanization of the United States occurred over a period of many years, with the nation only attaining urban-majority status between 1910 and 1920. Currently, over four-fifths of the U.S. population resides in urban areas, a percentage which is still increasing today. The United States Census Bureau changed its classification and definition of urban areas in 1950 and again in 1990, and caution is thus advised when comparing urban data from different time periods.\n\nUrbanization was fastest in the Northeastern United States, which acquired an urban majority by 1880. Some Northeastern U.S. states had already acquired an urban majority before then, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island (majority-urban by 1850), and New York (majority-urban since about 1870). The Midwestern and Western United States became urban majority in the 1910s, while the Southern United States only became urban-majority after World War II, in the 1950s...\n\nThe Western U.S. is the most urbanized part of the country today, followed closely by the Northeastern United States. The Southern U.S. experienced rapid industrialization after World War II, and is now over three-quarters urban, having almost the same urban percentage in 2010 as the Midwestern United States. Just four U.S. states (out of fifty) have a rural majority today, and even some of these states (such as Mississippi) are continuing to urbanize. Some U.S. states currently have an urban percentage around or above 90%, an urbanization rate almost unheard of a century ago.\n\nThe state of Maine (and Vermont, to a lesser degree) has bucked the trend towards greater urbanization which is exhibited throughout the rest of the United States.
