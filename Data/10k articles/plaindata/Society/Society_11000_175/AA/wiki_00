Abortion was illegal without exception prior to 1973. Congressional Decree 17-73 altered the penal code to allow abortion in cases in which the pregnant woman's life is endangered in September 1973. The procedure must be done by a physician and approved by a second doctor.\n\nArticle 3 of Chapter I in Title II of the Constitution of Guatemala grants the right to life from the point of conception. This article states that the government \"guarantee and protects human life since its conception, as same as the integrity and security of the person.\"\n\nArticles 133 to 140 in Guatemala's Constitution detail the imprisonment sentences for women and doctors who seek or perform abortions. The length of the sentences varies based on the context of the abortion. Some factors that affect the sentencing are: whether the involved parties had knowledge of pregnancy, if there was consent of the woman and if violence contributed to the abortion. There is an increase in the severity of punishment for nonconsensual abortions and abortions because of assault. However, abortion is strictly illegal in instances of the preservation of physical health, mental health, rape, incest, fetal impairment, economic or social reasons or by request. Abortion is only permitted in Guatemala to save the woman's life given that all other means of saving her life had been tried.\nThe government has attempted to lower the mortality rates of mothers and infants from induced abortions by advocating for the use of contraception as a preventive measure for an unwanted pregnancy. The method of contraception most commonly used is sterilization, which accounted for 60% of all the contraceptive use in Guatemala in 1995. In 1995, the contraceptive use among married women in Guatemala ages 15–44 was 27% and grew to 43% in 2002. However, unmet need for contraception among women in this age range rose from 19% to 28% from 1987 to 2002 showing how the reproductive health services in Guatemala are insufficient to help the entire population.\n\nSince 1973, the Guatemalan government has expressed concern over the number of induced abortions. This has led to discussion over the number of health clinics that treat women suffering from complications from an induced abortion. There are one hundred and eighty-three health clinics in Guatemala that treat the effects of an induced abortion. They are mainly concentrated in the Southwest and Metropolitan regions of the country, where abortion rates are the highest. However, the population in these areas is so dense that there are less health clinics per woman than there are in other areas of the country. Most areas in Guatemala have twelve to thirteen health clinics per one hundred thousand women, but in the Southwest and Metropolitan regions there are only seven facilities per one hundred thousand women. In some regions, the ratio is as low as four clinics per one hundred thousand women.\n\nRevisiting the abortion law and access to health clinics and contraception in Guatemala can be difficult, given the prominence of Catholicism in the country. In schools, there is little to no teaching on comprehensive sex education because of the influence of the Catholic Church. In 2009, it was estimated that 65-70% of the Guatemalan population was Catholic. Furthermore, the Catholic Church is very politically active. They participate in the Foro Guatemala, established in August 2001, that allows organizations and institutions to discuss issues of national importance. It provides a space for religious groups to voice views on abortion that influence the election and activities of politicians who are responsible for shaping Guatemalan law on abortion. Since the stance of the Catholic Church is conservative on abortion, Guatemala has strict abortion laws.\n\nThe law is divided into eight different articles numbered 133-140. The first article establishes Guatemala's legal definition of abortion as \"the death of the product of conception at any time of pregnancy\", while the rest address the imprisonment punishments associated with abortion.\n\nArticle 134 states that \"a woman who causes her abortion or consents to another person causing it, shall be punished with imprisonment of one to three years. If driven for reasons linked intimately to her state that produce undoubted psychic disturbance, the penalty shall be imprisonment of six months to two years\".\n\nArticle 135 concerns the role of consent in an abortion. If the woman consents to the abortion then the imprisonment term for the woman and the person who performs the procedure is one to three years. If the abortion is carried out intentionally without the consent of the woman then imprisonment is extended to three to six years. This article also addresses the nature of the abortion, stating that if \"violence, threat, or deceit has been employed, the penalty shall be imprisonment of four to eight years\".\n\nArticle 136 addresses the punishment for the person who incurred the abortion if the woman dies. If she consented and then died the punishment is three to eight years but if she did not consent then imprisonment is four to twelve years.\n\nArticle 137 states that an abortion with the consent of the woman and with the support of another doctor is not punishable if the death of the fetus was not intentional and was solely a result of trying to save the life of the mother, given that all other means of saving her were utilized.\n\nArticle 138 addresses unintended abortion. If violence occurs and an abortion is unintentionally caused while it is obvious that the victim is pregnant then imprisonment for the person responsible for the violence is one to three years. If there are injuries incurred onto the woman that are more than just an abortion then the length of imprisonment is increased by one third.\n\nArticle 139 address negligent abortion which is punished by one to three years' imprisonment given the woman knew she was pregnant.\n\nArticle 140 addresses specific aggravation related to abortion and states that \"A doctor who, abusing his or her profession, causes the abortion or cooperates in it shall be punished with the penalties provided for in Article 135, with a fine of five hundred to three thousand quetzals, with disqualification of exercising his or her profession for two to five years\".\n\nIn Guatemala, there are around 65,000 induced abortions performed each year, of which around 21,600 require hospitalization for complications. The abortion rate in Guatemala is about 24 per 1,000 women ages 15–49. The abortion rate is slightly higher in the southwest region of Guatemala, which is less developed and consists of a mostly indigenous population, and in metropolitan regions which have a high population concentration. In these areas of the country, abortions occur at a rate of about 29-30 per 1,000 women in the same age range. Nationally, the unintended pregnancy rate is around 66 per 1,000 women, meaning that about half of all unintended pregnancies result in a woman attempting an induced abortion\n\nOn February 24, 2017, a vessel docked in port of Puerto Quetzal, run by a group called Women on Waves, to provide abortions pills in international waters. The vessel, though it claimed it had permit rights to dock in Guatemala, was forced to leave by the Guatemalan army under orders from President Jimmy Morales and women were kept from boarding. The Guatemalan government justified their actions by stating that they were defending \"human life and the laws of the country\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1705609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1705609", "title": "Abul Hasan Qutb Shah", "text": "Abul Hasan Qutb Shah\n\nAbul Hasan Qutb Shah (Abul Hasan Tana Shah) was the eighth and last ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, sovereign of the kingdom of Golconda in South India. Tana Shah's reign was from 1672 to 1686.\n\nAlthough his real name was Abul Hasan, he was nicknamed 'Tana Shah' even before he became a contender to the throne of Golconda by his teacher, a Sufi saint called Syed Shah Raziuddin Multani, popularly known as Shah Raju Qattaal. Shah Raju was eighth in the lineage of the Sufi saint Syedna Khwaja Banda Nawaz Gesu daraz of Gulbarga. Abul Hassan had a good voice and sang well. He also had a certain innocence about him. Shah Raju, therefore, gave him the nickname of `Tana Shah' which means a child saint. He was also known as Tani Shah, meaning \"benevolent ruler\".\n\nHe is remembered as a popular statesman who did not discriminate against those of another ethnicity or religion. He hired Brahmins as his ministers and generals. For example, Madanna and Akkanna, Brahmin brothers from Hanamkonda, were his most important ministers. Tana Shah gained a place in Telugu literature due to Kancharla Gopanna, nephew of Madanna. Kancharla Gopanna is famously known as \"Ramadasu\". Ramadasu lived in Nelakondapalli village in Palvancha taluk. Tani Shah hired him as a \"tehsildar\" (head of a revenue department) of Palvancha taluk. Ramadasu diverted the public funds to construct a Rama temple in Bhadrachalam and for jewelry to adorn the idols of Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshmana. Tana Shah found Ramadasu guilty of misappropriation of public funds and put him in jail. After twelve years, Tana Shah released Ramadasu after getting Lord Rama in his dream and found Rammudras (golden coins with Lord Rama's image on it) beside him. Thereafter Tana Shah established a tradition to send pearls to the Badrachalam temple on every Rama Navami festival and was continued by his successors. The same tradition is continued to this day by the Government of the State of Telangana.\n\nEarlier Tana Shah's father-in-law, Abdullah Qutb Shah, was forced by Aurangzeb to acknowledge the suzerainty of Shah Jahan. His other daughter (that is, younger sister of Tana Shah's wife) was married to Aurangzeb's eldest son Sultan Muhammad.\n\nAbout the year 1683, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah appears to have become irregular in payment of taxes to the Mughals and his relations with Sikandar Adil Shah also caused concern among the Mughals. Abul Hasan Qutb Shah consequently refused to be a vassal of the Mughal Empire and prompted Aurangzeb to initiate a campaign to assert the rule of the Mughals on Golconda. He attacked Golconda with his commanders, Nawab Khwaja Abid Siddiqi (Qilich Khan) and Nawab Mir Ghaziuddin Khan Siddiqi Feroze Jung, father and grandfather of Nizam I (Asaf Jah I). Tana Shah defended the fort for eight months, but Aurangzeb succeeded in capturing Golconda at the end in September 1687. Abul Hasan Qutb Shah surrendered and handed over the Nur-Ul-Ain Diamond, the Hope Diamond, the Wittelsbach Diamond and the Regent Diamond, making the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb the richest monarch in the world.\n\nTana Shan was taken as a prisoner and was imprisoned in the Daulatabad Fort (near Aurangabad), where he would die after twelve years of captivity. When the Sultan died, he was not buried alongside his ancestors and other Qutub Shahi Kings but in a modest grave at Khuldabad near Aurangabad.\n\nShah Raju Qattal Hussaini Sent A Pomegranate For Abul Hassan Qutub Shah but Tanashah Only Ate 14 Pieces So Shah Raju Qattal Hussaini Claimed That Tanashah Will Rule For 14 Years. And Tanashah Only Ruled For 14 Years\n\nWith the defeat of Abul Hasan Qutub Shah, the Qutb Shahi dynasty ended and a new Nizam dynasty began in Hyderabad under the control of the Mughal Dynasty.\n\nAfter the fall of Golconda on 22 September 1687, it became a part of the six Mughal provinces in the Deccan. Mahabat Khan, who was initially the commander of the Qutb Shahi army and had switched loyalty to the Mughals, was appointed the governor of Golconda, laying the foundations for the Hyderabad State under the Nizams by Aurangzeb.\n\n"}
{"id": "4609721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4609721", "title": "Armenians in Lebanon", "text": "Armenians in Lebanon\n\nThe Armenians in Lebanon ( \"lipananahayer\", ) () are Lebanese citizens of Armenian descent. There has been an Armenian presence in Lebanon for centuries. According to Minority Rights Group International, there are 156,000 Armenians in Lebanon, around 4% of the population. Prior to the Lebanese Civil War, the number was higher, but the community lost a portion of its population to emigration. Prior to 1975, Beirut was a thriving center of Armenian culture with varied media production, which was exported to the Armenian diaspora.\n\nArmenians first established contact with Lebanon when Tigranes the Great conquered Phoenicia from the Seleucids and made it part of his short-lived Armenian Empire. When the Roman Empire established its rule over both Armenia and ancient Lebanon, some Roman troops of Armenian origin went there in order to accomplish their duties as Romans. After Armenia converted to Christianity in 301, Armenian pilgrims established contact with Lebanon and its people on their way to Jerusalem; some of whom would settle there.\n\nThe Armenian presence in Lebanon during the Ottoman period was minimal; however, there was a large influx of Armenians after the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Other Armenians inhabited the area of Karantina (literally \"Quarantine\", a port-side district in the Lebanese capital of Beirut). Later on, a thriving Armenian community was formed in the neighbouring district of Bourj Hammoud.\n\nIn 1939, after the French ceded the Syrian territory of Alexandretta to Turkey, Armenians and other Christians from the area moved to the Bekaa Valley. The Armenians were grouped in Anjar, where a community exists to this day. Some of these Armenian refugees had been settled by the French mandate authorities in camps in the South of Lebanon which would later make way for Palestinian refugees.\n\nDuring the Lebanese Civil War, Armenians, grouped in Bourj Hammoud and Anjar, did their best to remain neutral. There are three prominent Armenian political parties in Lebanon: the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (also Dashnak or Tashnag), Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (Hunchag) and Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (Ramgavar Party). They play significant influence in all facets of Armenian life. During this time militant organizations, such as ASALA, JCAG and ARA became active in Lebanon, and used it as a launching pad for their operations. ASALA was created by Armenian leftist nationalists in 1975 with support from allies in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The organization was headed by an Armenian militant named Monte Melkonian, who received training from several Palestinian resistance organizations that were active in Lebanon. According to sources within ASALA, the group's leader Hagop Hagopian became involved with Wadi Haddad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Hagopian Armenian Lebanese leftists also struck up an alliance with Kemal Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party. The Dashnak Party, on the other hand, had allied with Pierre Gemayel's right wing Phalangist party and the National Liberal Party of Camille Chamoun. They created the militant Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG) organization to help retain youth members after ASALA was founded. \n\nThe Armenian bloc of the Lebanese Parliament put forth a resolution, calling for the commemoration of the anniversary of the Armenian genocide; the legislature unanimously approved the resolution on 4 April 1997\n\nArmenians live in many parts of Lebanon. Historically most Armenians have lived in Beirut and Matn District. From Beirut proper we can mention grander Ashrafieh: Hadjen (Corniche Nahr), Khalil Badawi, Karm el Zeytoun (Հայաշէն), Rmeil, Jmmeyze, Soursok, and Jeitawi. Armenians have had strong presence also in other Beirut regions such as Khandaq Ghamik, Zuqaq al-Blat, Zarif, Bab Idris, Sanayeh (Kantari), Clemenceau and Hamra, among others. During the civil war many of these Armenians emigrated or fled to safer regions in Lebanon. From the Beirut suburbs, there are big concentrations in Matn District, particularly Bourj Hammoud, Dora-Amanos, Fanar, Rawda, Jdeide, Zalka, Jal El Dib, Antelias, Mzher (Dzaghgatzor), Naccash, Dbayeh, Awkar and in the regions situated from Antelias to Bikfaya. To the north, there are further Armenian populations scattered in Jounieh, Jbeil (Byblos) and Tripoli (particularly the Mina area). \n\nThere are Armenian religious centers in Antelias and Bikfaya (Armenian Apostolic Church) and Beirut and Bzommar (Armenian Catholic Church). There is an Armenian orphanage in historic sites in Jbeil (Byblos).\n\nIn the Bekaa, there are Armenians living in Zahlé and most notably Anjar.\n\nBourj Hammoud (, ) is a suburb in east Beirut, Lebanon in the Metn district. The suburb is heavily populated by Armenians as it is where most survivors of the Armenian genocide settled. Bourj Hammoud is an industrious area and is one of the most densely populated cities in the Middle East. It is divided into seven major regions, namely Dora, Sader, Nahr Beirut, Anbari, Mar Doumet, Naba'a and Gheilan. It is sometimes called \"Little Armenia\". Bourj Hamoud has a majority Armenian population but also has a notable number of other Lebanese Christians, a considerable Shi'a Muslim population, a Kurdish population, and some Palestinian refugees and newcomer Christian refugees from Iraq. Most streets in Bourj Hammoud are named after various Armenian cities such as Yerevan, mountains such as Aragats, and rivers such as Araks. A lot of streets are also named after cities and regions in modern-day-Turkey which were heavily populated by Armenians such as Cilicia, Marash, Sis, Adana, etc.\n\nMzher (or Dzaghgatzor in Armenian) is a small town located between Antelias and Bsalim, in Matn district. It is a new town, where most of the population is Armenian, along with other Christians. In Mzher the Armenian community has one of the top Armenian schools, Melankton and Haig Arslanian College (Jemaran) and a socio-cultural sport club, Aghpalian. The headquarters of SAHALCO are also situated nearby. Most of the Armenians of Mzher come from Bourj Hamoud, Ashrafieh, Anjar and the other old Armenian quarters.\n\nAnjar (, ), also known as Haoush Mousa (), is a town of Lebanon located in the Bekaa Valley. The population is about 2,400 consisting almost entirely of Armenians.\n\nAccording to the traditional Lebanese confessional representation in the Lebanese Parliament, a certain number of seats have been reserved for Armenian candidates according to their confession. Presently the Lebanese-Armenians are represented in the 128-seat Lebanese Parliament with 6 guaranteed seats (5 Armenian Orthodox and 1 Armenian Catholic) as follows:\n\nAs many Protestants in Lebanon are ethnic Armenians, the sole parliamentary slot for Evangelical (Protestant) community has at times been filled by an Armenian, making for a total of 7 Armenian deputees in the Lebanese Parliament. Lebanese Armenians have been represented in government by at least one government minister in the formations of Lebanese governments. In case of larger governments (with 24 ministers and above) Armenians are traditionally given two government ministry positions. Lebanese-Armenians also have their quota in top-level public positions. \n\nUnlike the Maronite Church and other religious groups in Lebanon, the Armenian Apostolic Church is not a political actor in its own right. Armenians do, however, enjoy political representation in Lebanon's multiconfessional government. Since the Cold War era, the Armenian Apostolic Church has participated in politics as a proxy for the ultranationalist Dashnak party.\n\nLebanon is the location of the only Armenian university outside Armenia. Haigazian University was established in Beirut by the Armenian Missionary Association of America and the Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East. Founded in 1955, Haigazian is a liberal arts Armenian institution of higher learning, which uses English as the language of instruction.\n\nMost Armenian schools are run by the three Armenian Christian denominations (Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical). Others are run by cultural associations like Hamazkayin and Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU). Notable schools include:\n\nAnatolian and kef music were a source of controversy due to the shared Ottoman past they represented in the post-genocide era. A combination of factors in Lebanon, including political independence and the strength of various Armenian institutions, created conditions that were permissive of the rise of an Armenian nationalism that was similar to the Turkish nationalism that emerged in the Ottoman Empire in the years leading up to the 1915 genocide. Music in the Lebanese diaspora became another means to separate \"us\" and \"them\", but also provided a space where Lebanese Armenians could connect with a concept of \"home\" in place of the Ottoman past and Soviet present.\n\nCommunity choirs that formed in Lebanon during the 1930s, led by former students of Komitas, utilized the imagery of Komitas as the saint and martyr of Armenian music. These choirs proved to be critical in the development of collective identity amongst Lebanese Armenians. According to Sylvia Angelique Alajaji, a professor of music who has studied music in the Armenian diaspora, \"in a literal and symbolic sense, the songs sung by the choirs articulated home and articulated belonging.\"\n\nArmenian pop music thrived in 1970s Lebanon, until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War. Many artists fled Lebanon during those years including pop singer Adiss Harmandian and classical soprano singer Arpine Pehlivanian. Songs were released about the war including one by Manuel Menengichian with the lyrics \"Brothers turned into lions against each other/ Tearing up your heart, Lebanon\".\n\nLike other cultural institutions of the Lebanese Armenian community, Armenian theater suffered during the years of the Lebanese Civil War. Many prominent figures decided to leave Lebanon; Berge Fazlian, founder of the Vahram Papazian group, was among those who fled during the wartime violence. Though theater experience a decline during the war years, it does not disappear entirely; the groups that remained in Lebanon were able to put on productions that filled the two theraters of Bourj Hammoud.\n\nFazlian is considered one of the most important figures in Lebanese theater; his theater projects were covered in Armenian, Arabic and French-language newspapers of the period. Fazlian was born in Istanbul in 1926; after obtaining his education in Turkey and directing several plays, a friendly colleague advised him to seek his fortune outside Turkey, imploring Fazlian to \"never leave the theater\", but also reminding him that an Armenian was not likely to land a leading role in Turkey. Fazlian left Istanbul in 1951 and settled in Beirut where he founded the \"Nor Pem\" (“New Stage”) theater group in 1956, Vahram Papazian in 1959, and \"Azad Pem\" (“Free Stage”) in 1971. \n\nLebanon had only one theater group in Beirut prior to Fazlian's creation of the Vahram Papazian group and that was Hamazkayin's Kasbar Ipegian theater company. Ipegian, who had settled in Beirut in 1930, was one of Hamazkayin's founders. Hamazkayin was the cultural arm of the Armenial Revolutionary Federation (ARF) or \"Dashnak\" party. The Hamazkayin Theater Association, which Ipegian founded in 1941, performed plays created by Armenian writers like Levon Shant and Papken Papazian. Their self-stated mission was to \"reestablish and spread the art of theater in the diaspora\". This included enhancing \"Armenian theater’s educational role in the preservation of national identity\".\n\nFazlian himself was a leftist and his group was associated the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU), while Ipegian's group was associated with Hamazkayin and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF). There was a rivalry between the two groups. Before Fazlian's group the only plays available were partisan plays presented by members of the ARF and their sympathesizers, who would perform in the Hamazkayin plays. On the other hand, Fazlian's Vahram Papazian group performed a variety of plays that included Western Armenian, Eastern Armenian and even non-Armenian plays.\n\nIn 1932 Siran Seza, a Lebanese-Armenian writer, began publishing the first feminist literary review for women in Lebanon called \"The Young Armenian Women\" (, \"Yeritasard Hayuhi\"). Seza was born in Constantinople (present day Istanbul) in 1903. Seza had transated Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" into Armenian when she was 15; her talent was recognized by Armenian poets of the era, such as Vahan Tekeyan, which led to her work being published in important literary journals of that time. The final issue of \"The Young Armenian Women\" was published in 1968.\n\nThe Armenian community in Lebanon developed educational institutions and organizations to address issues like poverty, which were exacerbated by the violent conflict and crisis in Lebanon. The focus of these institutions was on women's role as mothers, which is not uncommon in times of war or violent conflict. They sought to kept Armenian children connected to the community by offering cultural activies like traditional Armenian dance and music. The three main Armenian churches ran private Armenian schools for the children; even the poorest Armenian families tried to enroll their children in private Armenian schools and they often needed NGO assistance to pay for the schoolbooks.\n\nLife in the Armenian community of Bourj Hammoud was largely effected by gender. Non-Armenian men, even those who married Armenian women, rarely carried significant influence (\"wasta\") in the community's social networks. For example, access to the only low-income housing for Armenians was governed by a set of \"unofficial rules\"; in practice, this meant that Armenian men married to non-Armenian women could rent or purchase an apartment in the housing project, but Armenian women married to non-Armenian men would face significant hurdles to secure this type of housing.\n\nArmenian American historian Richard G. Hovannisian has described what he calls the \"economic vivacity\" of the Armenian community in Lebanon in terms of the hundreds of Armenian owned shops in Beirut. The city's business quarter closes down on April 24th, on the anniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n\nIn the years after World War II, between 1946 and 1948, the Soviet Union sposored a repatriation campaign encouraging Armenians living in diaspora to move to Soviet Armenia. In Beirut, which had a relatively large Armenian community, the repatriation campaign impacted the economy and destabilized the community. As Armenians emigrated from Beirut, property values deflated and lower income Arabs like Mutawali (a branch of Shi'a Islam) began to move into the Armenian quarters of the city. Hovannisian has written that \"This unwelcome infiltration of culturally less developed and rapidly multiplying Muslim elements has been bemoaned by the affected Armenians for a quarter of a century.\"\n\n\"Pyunik\" was the first Armenian newspaper in Lebanon (replaced by Aztag in 1927).\n\nThere are three Armenian daily newspapers published in Beirut all mouthpieces of the traditional Armenian political parties (Tashnag, Hunchag and Ramgavar). \n\nFrom the defunct Armenian political newspapers besides \"Pyunik\" in the 1920s, one should mention the independent non-partisan newspaper \"Ayk\" (after decades of publishing in Armenian, the licence owner Lucie Tosbat sold it to \"Monday Morning\" Publishing Group and \"Ayk\" started publishing as an English-language daily renamed \"Ike\" before folding.) \"Ayk\" daily's Lebanese-Armenian publishers Dikran and Lucie Tosbat also published the French language \"Le Soir\".\n\nSpecial mention should also be made for the Armenian leftist daily newspaper \"Joghovourti Tsayn\" (meaning Voice of the People) which had a short span of publication but remained influential during its span of publication. \n\nLebanon has a history of periodicals and weekly newspapers in the Armenian language. Notable long-running publications include:\n\n\nThe Lebanese state radio established very early on daily radio broadcasts in Armenian through its second channel consecrated to broadcasting in languages (mainly French and English). That programming goes on to date on Radio Liban. During the civil war, the Lebanese Armenians established a great number of unlicensed radio stations (some non-stop for 24 hours a day). The pioneer was the popular radio station \"Radio Paradise\" and later on \"Vana Tsayn\" (Voice of Van). However, with the Lebanese Parliament enacting laws organizing the airwaves, all the unlicensed stations (alongside the other Lebanese stations) had to close. They were replaced by two operating and fully licensed radio stations operating in Armenian in Lebanon in accordance with the new broadcast laws - \"Voice of Van\" and \"Radio Sevan\". \n\nLebanese private stations and state-owned Tele-Liban have consecrated occasionally television programming in Armenian on certain occasions. During the Lebanese civil war, an Armenian television station \"Paradise Television\" co-operated with \"Radio Paradise\" was established through a broadcast tower in Bourj Hammoud. But \"Paradise Television\" Armenian television station had to close after it failed to get a broadcasting licence according to the new laws organizing the airwaves. Al Mustaqbal Television (also known as Future Television) and OTV broadcast daily 30-minutes news and comments in Armenian in their regular programming schedule. \n\nOfficially, there are three Armenian denominations recognized by the government. The Armenians have Armenian Orthodox, Armenian Catholic, or Armenian Evangelical mentioned in their identity cards, in the denomination field. Sometimes, however, there are variations particularly in case of the Armenian Evangelicals, sometimes registered as just Evangelicals or Protestants without mention of Armenian. There are also some Armenian Catholics who are registered under the denomination Latin, sometimes Armenian Latin. \n\nThe Holy See of Cilicia is located in Antelias (a northern suburb of Beirut). It was relocated there in 1930 from Sis (historical Cilicia, now in Turkey) after the Armenian genocide. Alongside the Mother See of Holy Echmiadzin located in Armenia, it is one of the two sees of the Armenian Apostolic Church (the national church of Armenians). The Catholicos, the leader of the Holy See of Cilicia, has his summer residence in Bikfaya in the Matn District also north of Beirut. The seminary of the Armenian Apostolic Church is also on site at Bikfaya. The affairs of the Lebanese Armenian Orthodox population however are run by an independent body, the Armenian Prelacy of Lebanon (Aratchnortaran Hayots Lipanani) with its own Armenian Primate of Lebanon Bishop Shahé Panossian as head. \n\nThe Armenian Apostolic churches in Lebanon include:\n\nArmenian Catholic Church, has its patriarchate in the Lebanese capital Beirut, and represents Armenian Catholics around the world. Armenian Catholic Church also has its summer residence and its convent in Bzoummar, Lebanon.\n\nArmenian Catholic churches include:\n\nArmenian Evangelical Church, headquartered in Ashrafieh. The affairs of the Lebanese Evangelical community is run by the Union of the Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East (UAECNE).\n\nMajor Armenian Evangelical Churches:\n\nThe Armenian Evangelical Church has 5 active youth groups called \"Chanits\" which is a part of the World's Christian Endeavor Union. Children's, teenagers', and Chanits camps; women's conferences, church retreats, and educational programs take place at \"KCHAG\" which is located just outside Beirut in Mansouriyeh, Matn District.\nThere are also a number of \"Brethren\" churches of Evangelical orientation (\"Yeghpayroutyoun\" in Armenian). \n\nBikfaya is home to a commemorative plaque and monumental sculpture, honoring the victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide. Designed by Zaven Khedeshian and renovated by Hovsep Khacherian in 1993, the outdoor, freestanding sculpture rests on top of a hill that is located on the grounds of the summer retreat of the Catholicate of Cilicia.\n\nThe sculpture is a bronze abstract figure of a woman standing with hands open toward the sky. A plaque with Arabic and Armenian inscriptions reads:\"This monument, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, was erected with the cooperation of the whole Armenian Community in Lebanon, to celebrate the rebirth of the Armenian nation and to express gratitude to our country, Lebanon - April 24, 1969\"\n\nMembers of the Armenian community of Lebanon visit the monument on April 24 every other year. The pilgrimages are alternated with the memorial chapel at the Armenian Catholicossate in Antelias.\n\nThere are three predominantly Armenian sports clubs in Lebanon with a strong tradition in sports as well as Scouting.

Overall, both clubs feature in the top 5 of most titles in Lebanese football with Homenetmen Beirut winning seven Lebanese titles and Homenmen 4 titles.\n\nPagramian Sports Club was active with its football program in the 1940s and 1950s until it closure in 1960. In 1969, a new sports club Ararad Sports Association considered as a continuation of Pagramian's sports programme.\n\nArmenian clubs Antranik and Homenetmen have prominent basketball teams playing in the official first and second division basketball league in Lebanon, although the membership of the teams is mixed and is not restricted to Armenians and will usually include other Lebanese non-Armenian players as well as contracted foreign players.\nMany Lebanese Armenians have represented Lebanon in the national team. In women's sports, the Armenian basketball clubs (Homenetmen and Antranik) are traditionally considered as powerhouses in the sport, and both clubs have won the official Lebanese Basketball Championships women title on several occasions. The Armenian club Antranik's Women Basketball team went on to win the pan-Arab club championship titles. \n\nThe above mentioned Lebanese Armenian clubs also have huge influence on many other sports in Lebanon, but most notably in cycling, table tennis (ping pong) and track and fields. Individual Armenians have also excelled, most notably in weightlifting, wrestling and martial arts competitions. \n\nLebanese Armenians also have great influence in women sports in Lebanon, most notably in basketball, cycling and table tennis. The Armenian basketball clubs of Homenetmen and Antranik have won the official Lebanese Basketball Championships on several occasions. The Armenian club Antranik's Women Basketball team went on to win the pan-Arab championship titles. Homenetmen Antelias' Women Basketball team won the Lebanese championship consecutively twice in 2016 and 2017.\n\nLebanon knows a great number of Armenian notable personalities including politicians Khatchig Babikian, Karim Pakradouni, Hagop Pakradounian, media personalities like Zaven Kouyoumdjian, Paula Yacoubian, sportsmen like Wartan Ghazarian and artists like Paul Guiragossian, Pierre Chammassian, Guy Manoukian, Serj Tankian, Ara Malikian, John Dolmaian, C-rouge.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19190327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19190327", "title": "Aweer people", "text": "Aweer people\n\nThe Aweer (also known as the Waboni, Boni and Sanye) are an ethnic group inhabiting the Coast Province in southeastern Kenya. Some members are also found in southern Somalia. They are indigenous foragers, traditionally subsisting on hunting, gathering, and collecting honey.\n\nEvidence suggests that the Aweer/Boni, along with the related Dahalo and Wata, are remnants of the early Bushman hunter-gatherer inhabitants of Eastern Africa. According to linguistic, anthropological and other data, these groups later came under the influence and adopted the Afro-Asiatic languages of the Eastern and Southern Cushitic peoples who moved into the area. Dahalo has consequently retained some of the characteristic click sounds of the Khoisan languages.\n\nThe Aweer have historically been known in the literature as \"Boni\" or \"Sanye\", both of which are derogatory terms for low-caste groups. Their lives were drastically changed when the Kenyan government curtailed their traditional way of life in the 1960s, forcing them to settle in villages along the Hindi-Kiunga Road, between the Boni National Reserve and the Dodori National Reserve. Although the majority of the Aweer settled in villages located in this corridor between the two reserves, some established themselves in nearby Bajuni villages.\n\nToday, the Aweer in Kenya have been encouraged to adopt farming as their main livelihood. However, they also continue to engage in many of their traditional hunter-gatherer practices, utilizing the nearby forests for the collection of wild honey, plants for traditional medicine and building materials, and bush meat to supplement their diets. With laws banning the hunting of all wildlife in Kenya, the Aweer's traditional way of life is in danger.\n\nAccording to the 2009 Kenyan population census, around 7,500 Aweer live in Kenya, where they are an officially recognized group. They have traditionally been concentrated in forests in the Coast Province, particularly the Lamu and Tana River districts.\n\nSome Aweer also inhabit southern Somalia's Badhade district.\n\nThe Aweer speak the Aweer language, also known as Boni. It belongs to the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.\n\nAccording to \"Ethnologue\", there are around 8,000 speakers of Aweer/Boni. Most are bilingual and speak the languages of their immediate neighbors, with about 20% speaking only Aweer.\n\nAweer linguistically resembles Garre, but the speakers are physically and culturally unalike. The language is believed to be threatened by extinction.\n\nThe Aweer historically practised a traditional faith. Most have today adopted Islam.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54384", "title": "Awá (Brazil)", "text": "Awá (Brazil)\n\nThe Awá, or Guajá, are an indigenous people of Brazil living in the eastern Amazon rainforest. There are approximately 350 members, and 100 of them have no contact with the outside world. They are considered highly endangered because of conflicts with logging interests in their territory.\n\nThey speak Guajá, a Tupi–Guaraní language. Originally living in settlements, they adopted a nomadic lifestyle around 1800 to escape incursions by Europeans. During the 19th century, they came under increasing attack by settlers in the region, who cleared most of the forests from their land.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s onward, some Awá moved to government-established settlements. However, for the most part, they were able to maintain their traditional way of life of living entirely off their forests in nomadic groups of a few dozen people, with little or no contact with the outside world.\n\nIn 1982, the Brazilian government received a loan of US$900 million from the World Bank and the European Union. One condition of the loan was that the lands of certain indigenous peoples, including the Awá, would be demarcated and protected. That was particularly important for the Awá because their forests were increasingly being invaded by outsiders. There were many cases of tribespeople being killed by settlers, and the forest on which they depend was being destroyed by logging and land clearance for farming.\n\nWithout government intervention it seemed very likely that the Awá and their ancient culture would become extinct.\n\nHowever, the Brazilian government was extraordinarily slow to act on its commitment. It took 20 years of sustained pressure from campaigning organisations such as Survival International and, earlier, the Forest Peoples Programme before, in March 2003, the Awá's land was finally demarcated.\n\nMeanwhile, encroachment on their land and a series of massacres had reduced their numbers to about 300, only about 60 of whom were still living their traditional hunter-gatherer way of life.\n\nIn late 2011, illegal loggers burned an 8-year-old Awá girl alive after she wandered out of her village. The murder happened inside a protected area in the state of Maranhão. Luis Carlos Guajajaras, a leader from another people, said that the girl had been killed as a warning to other native peoples living in the protected area.\n\nAccording to the Indigenous Missionary Council about 450 indigenous people were murdered between 2003 and 2010. An investigation discovered the Awá camp in question had been destroyed by loggers. \n\nAccording to Survival International, a human rights organization which campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal peoples and considers them to be the \"earth's most threatened tribe,\" Awá forests are now disappearing faster than in any other Indian area in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nIn April 2012, Survival International launched a worldwide campaign, backed by the actor Colin Firth, to protect the Awá people. \n\nIn September 2012, Brazil's Indian Affairs Department claimed that loggers were only 6 km away from the Awa.\n\n"}

It is a horizontal, non-hierarchical network, with no permanent structures of any kind.\n\nBabels originated in the process of preparation for the 2002 ESF, a left-wing conference of the anti-globalization movement held in Florence. A small network of 'communication activists' associated with ATTAC France proposed that the conference use only volunteers to interpret the various languages of the speakers for the audience. There was some debate about the quality of volunteer translators but the cost of professionals helped sway the argument. A last-minute call went out for volunteers to which 600 people responded and which finally resulted in around 350 volunteer interpreters and translators for the Forum. The group had no official space to work from and little funds so had to squat a medieval tower.\n\nAfter the first ESF the organisers of the translation formed Babels groups in France and Italy and groups also sprang up in Germany, the UK, and Spain.These groups went on to participate in counter G8 conferences in Evian and Annemasse.\n\nFor the second ESF in Paris organisers gave Babels £200,000 funding, offices facilities and a longer preparation period. Over 1000 Babelistas (Babels translation volunteers) took part in the translation.\n\nThe Babels organisation went on to provide translation for the ESF's global partner the World Social Forum (WSF) in Mumbai and the first Social Forum of the Americas in Ecuador and the third ESF in London.\n\nBabels describes itself as \"\"not a provider of linguistic services\" but rather \"a political actor\"\" and will not work on any project unless it has been involved in contributing to the definition of the project with its ideas and demands.\n\n"}

{"id": "18246944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18246944", "title": "Broken Slavey", "text": "Broken Slavey\n\nBroken Slavey (also \"Broken Slavé, Broken Slave, Slavey Jargon, Broken Slavee,\" and \"le Jargon esclave\") was a trade language used between Native Americans and whites in the Yukon area (for example, in around Liard River and in the Mackenzie River district) in the 19th century.\n\nBroken Slavey is based primarily on the Slavey language with elements from French, Cree, and perhaps to a lesser extent English. However, there is some disagreement among sources: Petitot (1889) states that it lacks English, Dene Suline (Chipewyan), or Gwich'in (Kutchin) elements in contrast to the neighbouring Loucheux Pidgin (or Loucheux Jargon), while Dall (1870) states that it includes English elements and McClellan (1981) states that it contained Dene Suline influences. Later sources have ignored the earlier accounts and assumed that \"Broken Slavey\" is merely French vocabulary (loanwords) used in northern Athabascan languages. Michael Krauss has suggested that French loanwords in Athabascan languages may have been borrowed via Broken Slavey.\n\nA further difference among sources is that Petitot distinguishes the Broken Slavey trade language spoken along the Mackenzie River from a different trade language called Loucheux Pidgin that was spoken along the Peel (a tributary of the Mackenzie) and Yukon rivers. Other contemporary sources as well as later sources do not make a distinction between Broken Slavey and Loucheux Pidgin, which may explain their inclusion of English, Dene Suline, and Gwich'in as influences on Broken Slavey.\n\nThe native languages of speakers who used Broken Slavey (known in Alaska as 'Slavey') were Dene Suline, French, Gwich'in, Inuktitut, Slavey. One notable speaker of Slavey Jargon was Antoine Hoole, the Hudson's Bay Company translator at Fort Yukon. Hoole (or Houle) was a professional servant of the Company who served for well over twenty years at Peel River and at Fort Yukon.\n\nHaving a French-speaking father and a Métis mother, Hoole was born in 1827 and raised in a household where at least two languages were spoken. He originally came from Fort Halkett on the Liard River in what is now the southern Yukon Territory. He probably spoke South Slavey because that was the Native American language spoken around the Liard River, although Sekani and Kaska people also frequented the area. Hoole died in Fort Yukon at the age of forty-one, on October 22, 1868. The Gwich'in apparently stopped speaking the jargon in the early 20th century. The gold rush, with its massive influx of English speakers into the region beginning in 1886, probably provided a death blow. One speaker, Malcolm Sandy Roberts of Circle, Alaska, continued to use it in a diminished form until his death in 1983.\n\nThe best written historical documentation of Slavey Jargon shows its actual use was for preaching the gospel and for teasing and harassing clergymen, and for interpersonal relationships. For all these reasons, it seems inaccurate to characterize it strictly as a trade jargon.\n\nBroken Slavey has recently been documented with a few vocabulary items and phrases (collected in Petitot's work) and only a little of its grammar and lexicon. However, more information may yet be discovered in archives through missionary records and traders' journals.\n\n"}

Nearly two-thirds of the population lives in Asia and is predominantly urban and suburban, with more than 2.5 billion in the countries of China and India combined. The world's fairly low literacy rate (83.7%) is attributable to poverty. Lower literacy rates are common in South Asia, West Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe world's largest ethnic group is Han Chinese with Mandarin being the world's most spoken language in terms of native speakers.\n\nHuman migration has been shifting toward cities and urban centers, with the urban population jumping from 29% in 1950, to 50.5% in 2005. Working backwards from the United Nations prediction that the world will be 51.3 percent urban by 2010, Dr. Ron Wimberley, Dr. Libby Morris and Dr. Gregory Fulkerson estimated 23 May 2007 to be the first time the urban population outnumbered the rural population in history.\nChina and India are the most populous countries, as the birth rate has consistently dropped in developed countries and until recently remained high in developing countries. Tokyo is the largest urban conglomeration in the world.\n\nThe total fertility rate of the World is estimated as 2.52 children per woman, which is above the global average for the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.33 (as of 2003). However, world population growth is unevenly distributed, with the total fertility rate going from .91 in Macau, to 7.68 in Niger. The United Nations estimated an annual population increase of 1.14% for the year of 2000.\nThe current world population growth is approximately 1.09%\nPeople under 18 years of age made up over a quarter of the world population (29.3%), and people age 65 and over made up less than one-tenth (7.9%) in 2011.\n\nThe world population more than tripled during the 20th century from about 1.65 billion in 1900 to 5.97 billion in 1999.\n\nIt reached the 2 billion mark in 1927, the 3 billion mark in 1960, 4 billion in 1974, and 5 billion in 1987. Currently, population growth is fastest among low wealth, Least Developed Countries countries.\n\nThe UN projects a world population of 9.15 billion in 2050, which is a 32.69% increase from 2010 (6.89 billion).\n\nHistorical migration of human populations begins with the movement of \"Homo erectus\" out of Africa across Eurasia about a million years ago. \"Homo sapiens\" appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 50,000 - 60,000 years ago, and had spread across Australia, Asia and Europe by 30,000 years BC. Migration to the Americas took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, and by 2,000 years ago, most of the Pacific Islands were colonized.\n\nUntil c. 10,000 years ago, humans lived as hunter-gatherers. They generally lived in small nomadic groups known as band societies. The advent of agriculture prompted the Neolithic Revolution, when access to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements. About 6,000 years ago, the first proto-states developed in Mesopotamia, Egypt's Nile Valley and the Indus Valley. Early human settlements were dependent on proximity to water and, depending on the lifestyle, other natural resources used for subsistence. But humans have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology.\n\nSince 1800, the human population has increased from one billion to over seven billion, In 2004, some 2.5 billion out of 6.3 billion people (39.7%) lived in urban areas. In February 2008, the U.N. estimated that half the world's population would live in urban areas by the end of the year. Problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime, especially in inner city and suburban slums. Both overall population numbers and the proportion residing in cities are expected to increase significantly in the coming decades.\n\nThe World has hundreds of major cities spread across 6 continents. Most are in coastal regions.\n\n, the World had 62 metropolitan areas with a population of over 3,000,000 people each.\n\nAs of 2010, about 3 billion people live in or around urban areas.\n\nThe following table shows the populations of the top ten conglomerations.\n\nThe world's population is 7 billion and Earth's total area (including land and water) is 510 million square kilometers (197 million square miles). Therefore, the worldwide human population density is 7 billion ÷ 510 million = 13.7 per km² (35.5 per sq. mile). If only the Earth's land area of 150 million km² (58 million sq. miles) is taken into account, then human population density increases to 46.7 per km² (117.2 per sq. mile). This calculation includes all continental and island land area, including Antarctica. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to 50 people per km² (129.28 per sq. mile). Considering that over half of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human inhabitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and that population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources, this number by itself does not give any meaningful measurement of human population density.\n\nSeveral of the most densely populated territories in the world are city-states, microstates or dependencies. These territories share a relatively small area and a high urbanization level, with an economically specialized city population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and overpopulation.\n\nThe table below lists religions classified by philosophy; however, religious philosophy is not always the determining factor in local practice. Please note that this table includes heterodox movements as adherents to their larger philosophical category, although this may be disputed by others within that category. For example, Cao Đài is listed because it claims to be a separate category from Buddhism, while Hòa Hảo is not, even though they are similar new religious movements.\n\nThe population numbers below are computed by a combination of census reports, random surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example United States or France), and self-reported attendance numbers, but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count. Some organizations may wildly inflate their numbers.\n\nSince the late 19th century, the demographics of religion have changed a great deal. Some countries with a historically large Christian population have experienced a significant decline in the numbers of professed active Christians: see demographics of atheism. Symptoms of the decline in active participation in Christian religious life include declining recruitment for the priesthood and monastic life, as well as diminishing attendance at church. On the other hand, since the 19th century, large areas of sub-Saharan Africa have been converted to Christianity, and this area of the world has the highest population growth rate. In the realm of Western civilization, there has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as secular humanists. In many countries, such as the People's Republic of China, communist governments have discouraged religion, making it difficult to count the actual number of believers. However, after the collapse of communism in numerous countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, religious life has been experiencing resurgence there, both in the form of traditional Eastern Christianity and in the forms of Neopaganism and Far Eastern religions.\n\nFollowing is some available data based on the work of the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\":\n\nStudies conducted by the Pew Research Center have found that, generally, poorer nations had a larger proportion of citizens who found religion to be very important than richer nations, with the exceptions of the United States and Kuwait.\n\nThe average age of marriage varies greatly from country to country and has varied through time. Women tend to marry earlier than men and currently varies from 17.6 for women in Niger, to 32.4 for women in Denmark while men range from 22.6 in Mozambique to 35.1 in Sweden.\n\nThe average number of hospital beds per 1,000 population is 2.94. Compare to Switzerland (18.3) and Mexico (1.1)\n\n96% of the urban population has access to improved drinking water, while only 78% of rural inhabitants have improved drinking water. A total average of 87% of urban and rural have access to improved drinking water.\n\n4% of the urban population does not have access to improved drinking water, leaving 22% of rural people without improved drinking water with a total world population of 13% not having access to drinking water.\n\n76% of the urban population has access to sanitation facilities, while only 45% of the rural population has access. A total world average of 39% do not have access to sanitation facilities.\n\nAs of 2009, there are an estimated 33.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS, which is approximately 0.8% of the world population, and there have been an estimated 1.8 million deaths attributed to HIV/AIDS.\n\nAs of 2010, 925 million people are undernourished.\n\nLife Expectancy at Birth:\n\nInfant Mortality\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nAccording to the 2006 CIA World Factbook, around 27% of the world's population is below 15 years of age.\n\nAccording to a report by the Global Social Change Research Project, worldwide, the percent of the population age 0-14 declined from 34% in 1950 to 27% in 2010. On the other hand, the percent elderly (60+) increased during the same period from 8% to 11%.\n\nGlobally, the growth rate of the human population has been declining since peaking in 1962 and 1963 at 2.20% per annum. In 2009, the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1%. The CIA World Factbook gives the world annual birthrate, mortality rate, and growth rate as 1.915%, 0.812%, and 1.092% respectively The last one hundred years have seen a rapid increase in population due to medical advances and massive increase in agricultural productivity made possible by the Green Revolution.\nThe actual annual growth in the number of humans fell from its peak of 88.0 million in 1989, to a low of 73.9 million in 2003, after which it rose again to 75.2 million in 2006. Since then, annual growth has declined. In 2009, the human population increased by 74.6 million, which is projected to fall steadily to about 41 million per annum in 2050, at which time the population will have increased to about 9.2 billion. Each region of the globe has seen great reductions in growth rate in recent decades, though growth rates remain above 2% in some countries of the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, and also in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.\n\nSome countries experienced negative population growth, especially in Eastern Europe mainly due to low fertility rates, high death rates and emigration. In Southern Africa, growth is slowing due to the high number of HIV-related deaths. Some Western Europe countries might also encounter negative population growth. Japan's population began decreasing in 2005.\n\nPopulation in the world increased from 1990 to 2008 with 1,423 million and 27% growth. Measured by persons, the increase was highest in India (290 million) and China (192 million). Population growth was highest in Qatar (174%) and United Arab Emirates (140%).\n\nData required on total number of births per year, and distribution by country.\n\nAs of 2009, the average birth rate (unclear whether this is the weighted average rate per country [with each country getting a weight of 1], or the unweighted average of the entire world population) for the whole world is 19.95 per year per 1000 total population, a 0.48% decline from 2003's world birth rate of 20.43 per 1000 total population. \n\nAccording to the CIA - The World Factbook, the country with the highest birth rate currently is Niger at 51.26 births per 1000 people. The country with the lowest birth rate is Japan at 7.64 births per 1000 people. Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of China, is at 7.42 births per 1000 people. As compared to the 1950s, birth rate was at 36 births per 1000 in the 1950s, birth rate has declined by 16 births per 1000 people. In July 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline. \n\nBirth rates vary even within the same geographic areas. In Europe, as of July 2011, Ireland's birth rate is 16.5 per cent, which is 3.5 per cent higher than the next-ranked country, the UK. France has a birth rate of 12.8 per cent while Sweden is at 12.3 per cent. In July 2011, the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) announced a 2.4% increase in live births in the UK in 2010 alone. This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years. By contrast, the birth rate in Germany is only 8.3 per 1,000, which is so low that both the UK and France, which have significantly smaller populations, produced more births in 2010. Birth rates also vary within the same geographic area, based on different demographic groups. For example, in April 2011, the U.S. CDC announced that the birth rate for women over the age of 40 in the U.S. rose between 2007 and 2009, while it fell among every other age group during the same time span. In August 2011, Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that it implemented a host of approaches to encourage its citizens to have babies.\n\nBirth rates ranging from 10-20 births per 1000 are considered low, while rates from 40-50 births per 1000 are considered high. There are problems associated with both an extremely high birth rate and an extremely low birth rate. High birth rates can cause stress on the government welfare and family programs to support a youthful population. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental effects that a large population can produce. Low birth rates can put stress on the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and also the stress on families to support the elders themselves. There will be less children or working age population to support the constantly growing aging population.\n\nThe ten countries with the highest crude death rate, according to the 2015 CIA World Factbook estimates, are:\n\nSee list of countries by death rate for worldwide statistics.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the 10 leading causes of death in 2002 were:\n\n\nCauses of death vary greatly between first and third world countries.\n\nAccording to Jean Ziegler (the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food for 2000 to March 2008), mortality due to malnutrition accounted for 58% of the total mortality in 2006: \"In the world, approximately 62 millions people, all causes of death combined, die each year. In 2006, more than 36 millions died of hunger or diseases due to deficiencies in micronutrients\".\n\nOf the roughly 150,000 people who died each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—died of age-related causes in 2001, according to an article which counts all deaths \"due to causes that kill hardly anyone under the age of 40\" as age-related.<ref name=\"doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011\"></ref> In industrialized nations, the proportion was even higher according to that article, reaching 90%.\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands have the highest female ratio with 0.77 males per female. Qatar has the highest male ratio, with 2.87 males/female. For the group aged below 15, Sierra Leone has the highest female ratio with 0.96 males/female, and the Republic of Georgia and the People's Republic of China are tied for the highest male ratio with 1.13 males/female (according to the 2006 CIA World Factbook).\n\nThe value for the entire world population is 1.02 males/female, with 1.07 at birth, 1.06 for those under 15, 1.02 for those between 15 and 64, and 0.78 for those over 65.\n\nThe \"First World\" G7 members all have a sex ratio in the range of 0.95–0.98 for the total population, of 1.05–1.07 at birth, of 1.05–1.06 for the group below 15, of 1.00–1.04 for the group aged 15–64, and of 0.70–0.75 for those over 65.\n\nCountries on the Arabian Peninsula tend to have a 'natural' ratio of about 1.05 at birth but a very high ratio of males for those over 65 (Saudi Arabia 1.13, United Arab Emirates 2.73, Qatar 2.84), indicating either an above-average mortality rate for females or a below-average mortality for males, or, more likely in this case, a large population of aging male guest workers. Conversely, countries of Eastern Europe (the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia) tend to have a 'normal' ratio at birth but a very low ratio of males among those over 65 (Russia 0.46, Latvia 0.48, Ukraine 0.52); similarly, Armenia has a far above average male ratio at birth (1.17), and a below-average male ratio above 65 (0.67). This effect may be caused by emigration and higher male mortality as result of higher post-Soviet era deaths; it may also be related to the enormous (by western standards) rate of alcoholism in the former Soviet states. Another possible contributory factor is an aging population, with a higher than normal proportion of relatively elderly people: we recall that due to higher differential mortality rates the ratio of males to females reduces for each year of age.\n\nThere is an inverse correlation between income and fertility, wherein developed countries usually have a much lower fertility rate. Various fertility factors may be involved, such as education and urbanization. Mortality rates are low, birth control is understood and easily accessible, and costs are often deemed very high because of education, clothing, feeding, and social amenities. With wealth, contraception becomes affordable. However, in countries like Iran where contraception was made artificially affordable before the economy accelerated, birth rate also rapidly declined. Further, longer periods of time spent getting higher education often mean women have children later in life. Female labor participation rate also has substantial negative impact on fertility. However, this effect is neutralized among Nordic or liberalist countries.\n\nIn undeveloped countries on the other hand, families desire children for their labour and as caregivers for their parents in old age. Fertility rates are also higher due to the lack of access to contraceptives, generally lower levels of female education, and lower rates of female employment in industry.\n\n8.7% (2010 est.)\n8.2% (2009 est.)\nnote: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically 4%-12% unemployment (2007 est.)\n\nThe demonym for Earth's inhabitants is Earthling or, as either a noun or an adjective, Terran.\n\nWorldwide, English is used widely as a lingua franca and can be seen to be the dominant language at this time. The world's largest language by native speakers is Mandarin Chinese which is a first language of around 960 million people, or 12.44% of the population, predominantly in Greater China. Spanish is spoken by around 330 to 400 million people, predominantly in the Americas and Spain. Arabic is spoken by around 280 million people. Hindi is spoken by about 200 million speakers, mostly in India. Bengali is spoken by around 230 million people, predominantly in India and Bangladesh. Portuguese is spoken by about 230 million speakers in Portugal, Brazil, East Timor, and Southern Africa.\n\nThere are numerous other languages, grouped into nine major families:\n\n\nThere are also hundreds of non-verbal sign languages.\n\nTotal population: 83.7% over the age of 15 can read and write, 88.3% male and 79.2% female \nnote: over two-thirds of the world's 793 million illiterate adults are found in only eight countries (Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan); of all the illiterate adults in the world, two-thirds are women; extremely low literacy rates are concentrated in three regions, the Arab states, South and West Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, where around one-third of the men and half of all women are illiterate (2005-09 est.) \n\nAs of 2008, the school life expectancy (primary to tertiary education) for a man or woman is 11 years. \n"}

Saudi Arabia is currently the largest hirer of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), and has the largest Filipino population in the Middle East. Filipinos make up the fourth-largest group of foreigners in Saudi Arabia, and are the second-largest source of remittances to the Philippines.\n\nFilipinos first arrived in Saudi Arabia in 1973, when a group of Filipino engineers migrated to the country. Today, staff at the Saudi Arabian embassy in the Philippines process between 800 and 900 jobs for Filipinos daily. In 2008, Saudi Arabia had 300,000 job orders for Filipinos. Later, in the first time hiring Filipino medical professionals, Saudi Arabia announced intentions to hire 6,000 Filipinos as doctors and nurses between 2009 and 2011. In addition to medical professionals, Filipinos work as automotive workers, construction workers, and engineers, as well as in the fields of desalination, petroleum production and processing, telecommunications, and transportation.\n\nEvery year, an unknown number of Filipinos in Saudi Arabia are \"victims of sexual abuses, maltreatment, unpaid salaries, and other labor malpractices,\" because of Religion according to John Leonard Monterona, the Middle East coordinator of Migrante, a Manila-based OFW organization. Some Filipinos are attracted and transported to Saudi Arabia illegally, where they are left stranded without work. Between January and August 2008, approximately 800 throughout the country sought help at Migrante chapters, and 922 others were deported to the Philippines in the first three months of 2008 after overstaying their visa requirements. At one point in early 2008, 103 Filipinos stranded in Jeddah lived in a tent camp under a bridge before being able to be processed for deportation.\n\nAs of February 2006 about 75% of the Philippine international schools represented by the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) were located in Saudi Arabia. Community-owned Philippine schools, including the International Philippine School in Al Khobar (IPSA), the International Philippine School in Jeddah (IPSJ), and International Philippine School in Riyadh (IPSR), were by 2006 managed by independent school boards but were initially managed by the diplomatic missions themselves. As of 2006 Riyadh has 13 Philippine private schools and Jeddah has 5 Philippine private schools.\n\nLarge numbers of Philippine children came to Saudi after many Filipino workers arrived in Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. The first Philippine school in Saudi Arabia, Philippine School in Jeddah was established after the Philippine Consulate in Jeddah began making efforts to start a school in 1983, and Philippine schools were later established in Riyadh and other Saudi cities. In 2000 Saudi Arabia had nine accredited Philippine schools. By 2005 Jeddah alone had four Philippine international schools, with two more scheduled to open shortly. By 2006 there were 21 Philippine schools recognized by the CFO, reflecting a 133% growth rate from 2000.\n\nCommunity international schools in Saudi Arabia are not required to separate male and female students into separate campuses and are allowed to host social activities with men and women mixed. Regis and Guzman stated that in private Philippine international schools, unlike in the community schools, many Saudi rules that are not consistent with the culture of the Philippines are enforced.\n\nThe Filipino (Muslim) community has organized recreation and sometimes tournaments, to meet with fellow friends, relatives and fellow Filipinos.\n\nList of sports:\nSix (6) Teams Participated in basketball for MAISA Organizer 2017\n"}

Its collection of 72,300 titles is amongst the largest in the German speaking countries. The institution consists of a lending library, a publishing house, and a research center for barrier-free communication. It also has production facilities for braille books, audiobooks, and braille music. The DZB publishes about 250 new titles annually. Founded in 1894, the DZB is the oldest library for the blind in Germany.\n\nA private association, the Society for the Procurement of Large-print Books and Work Opportunities for the Blind (), was established in Leipzig in 1894 to provide blind persons with literature and employment. It was set up in a bookseller's house and grew into the first library for blind persons in the German Empire. Soon afterward the society established its own publishing house and printing press. A charitable foundation, the \"Verein zur Förderung der Deutschen Zentralbücherei für Blinde\", was established in 1916 to support and promote the library. By this time over 5,000 braille volumes were available and it had 1,200 regular users.\n\nFollowing World War I, the number of users rose sharply and by 1926 the DZB had 3,500 users. The Great Depression forced the library into a rigid austerity, resulting in budget cuts and layoffs. In 1935 the DZB moved into the commercial publishing house \"Druckhaus Klepzig\" on the Täubchenweg in Leipzig. This building was later destroyed in an Allied bombing raid in December 1943 and over 30,000 of the library's books were lost. What little remained of the collection was set up at an alternative site at Döbeln in 1944.\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II the DZB moved to new quarters on the Weißenfelser Straße with a collection of 1,802 books. Through a decision of the provincial government on 7 November 1946 the library was declared a public institution. By 1949 the library's collection had reached 10,000 volumes. In 1952 DZB came under the auspices of the East German Ministry of Education and in 1955 it was subject to the Ministry of Culture. In 1954 the library moved into the building still in use today in Gustav-Adolf-Straße (Gustavus Adolphus Street).\n\nFollowing German reunification the DZB became an agency of the State Ministry of Science and Arts of the new Free State of Saxony.\n\nAs of December 2011 the library holds some 72,300 titles. A research section holds books, periodicals and monographs on visual impairment. In addition, the DZB regularly publishes 18 different journals in Braille and in audio versions. The DZB's collection includes:\n\n\nEach year the DZB produces about 250 new titles. It has a staff of 77 employees, 15 of whom are persons with disabilities. According to the DZB, \"over 5,000 members use the library's different services.\"\n\nThe \"DaCapo\" project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Health, began at the DZB in 2003 to produce specialty sheet music for the blind. The goal is not only to make musical scores more widely available to the visually impaired, but also to improve career opportunities for blind musicians. The DZB's research center is also developing processes for the computer-assisted production of sheet music in Braille and as well as transmission services.\n\nThe \"MakeBraille\" rendering service accepts digital musical notation files over the Internet in CapXML and MusicXML formats to produce sheet music in Braille format, available for private, non-commercial uses only.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Josh O'Connor and Alec Secăreanu. The plot follows a young sheep farmer in Yorkshire whose life is transformed by the arrival of a Romanian migrant worker. The film was the only UK-based production to feature in the world drama category at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival where it won the world cinema directing award.\n\nIn Yorkshire, Johnny lives on the family farm with his father, Martin, and grandmother, Deirdre. Due to his father having suffered from a stroke, and his grandmother's age, much of the day-to-day running of the farm falls to Johnny. In his social time, Johnny engages in binge drinking and furtive sexual encounters with other men. Returning late to the farm after such an encounter with a young male auctioneer, he is berated by his father after a calf dies from a breech birth in his absence.\n\nGheorghe, a Romanian migrant worker, is hired as extra help for lambing season. He arrives and spends his first night in a caravan that the family has organized as his accommodation. As the ewes have moved away from the main part of the farm, and as part of the farm's boundary wall remains unrepaired by Johnny, it is decided that Johnny and Gheorghe should spend several days camping nearer to the animals. When one of the ewes gives birth to an unconscious runt, Johnny is intrigued when Gheorghe is able to resuscitate and care for it. One morning, after Johnny refers to Gheorghe yet again as a \"gypsy,\" Gheorghe tackles him to the ground and warns Johnny not to speak that way to him again.\n\nThe next day, the two men again engage in a fight that turns into rough sex. While Johnny initially does not acknowledge the encounter, the two share cigarettes and a sugar packet for their cup noodles throughout the day. That night, Gheorghe resists Johnny's aggressive move to have sex, instead patiently showing him that sex can also be tender, and the two men kiss for the first time.\n\nReturning to the farm, Johnny invites Gheorghe to stay with him in the house, but Gheorghe elects to remain in the caravan. When Martin suffers a second stroke, Johnny realizes that the running of the farm is now entirely his responsibility, and asks Gheorghe if he will stay with him. When Gheorghe expresses uncertainty over whether they can stay together and maintain the farm simultaneously, Johnny reacts poorly, over-drinking and engaging in another random sexual encounter. When Gheorghe realises what Johnny has done, he abruptly leaves the farm.\n\nMartin is released from the hospital, but is now fully debilitated. Johnny, desperate to make up with Gheorghe, tells his father that he will stay to run the farm, but that things must be run on his terms. Martin gives his tacit approval to Johnny, who sets off to bring Gheorghe back to the farm. After he finds Gheorghe working in Scotland, the two men reconcile. Gheorghe returns with Johnny; the caravan is taken away, and Gheorghe moves into the house.\n\n\nThe film is partly based on writer and director Francis Lee's own life, where he also had to make a decision to either stay and work on his family's farm or go off to drama school.\n\nThe film was shot in Yorkshire, specifically around the Silsden area of Keighley in West Yorkshire, with some other scenes being shot in Keighley Bus Station and Airedale General Hospital with Haworth and Otley also featuring as backdrops for the film.\n\nThe production was part financed through the British Film Council's iFeature programme with additional funding being secured from Creative England.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 23 January 2017. It was the only production from the United Kingdom that featured in the world drama category in the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. It went onto screen at the Berlin International Film Festival on 11 February 2017.\n\nShortly after, Picturehouse Entertainment, Orion Pictures and Samuel Goldwyn Films acquired U.K. and U.S. distribution rights respectively. It was released in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2017.\n\nThe film was banned in some Arab countries due to explicit sex scenes between the two protagonists. Likewise, Romania was the only country in Eastern Europe where the film was screened.\n\n\"God's Own Country\" received critical acclaim. It holds a 99% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 102 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A quiet, moving rumination on loneliness and newfound intimacy, \"God's Own Country\" marks an outstanding directorial debut for Francis Lee.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 85 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival's listing for \"God's Own Country\" says that \"you can smell the mud in this movie\" while also describing Francis Lee as a major new talent and the film as \"one not to be missed.\" Peter Bradshaw, writing in \"The Guardian\", gave the film four stars out of five. Bradshaw described the film as \"an almost, but not quite a Dales \"Brokeback,\"\" and also as a \"very British love story, bursting at the seams with unspoken emotions, unvoiced fears about the future, and a readiness to displace every emotion into hard physical work\".\n\nAt the 2017 Berlin International Film Festival the film received the Harvey Award, presented by the Teddy Awards programme for LGBT-related films in conjunction with a reader jury from the German LGBT magazine \"Männer\".\n\nEd Potton, writing in \"The Times\", gave the film four stars out of five and described the film as \"splendid\" and \"[a] potent film, a Yorkshire \"Brokeback Mountain\"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "167734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167734", "title": "Iranian Georgians", "text": "Iranian Georgians\n\nIranian Georgians (; ) are Iranian citizens who are ethnically Georgian, and are an ethnic group living in Iran. Today's Georgia was a subject to Iran from the 16th century till the early 19th century, starting with the Safavids in power. Shah Abbas I, his predecessors, and successors, relocated by force hundreds of thousands of Christian, and Jewish Georgians as part of his programs to reduce the power of the Qizilbash, develop industrial economy, strengthen the military, and populate newly built towns in various places in Iran including the provinces of Isfahan and Mazandaran. A certain amount, amongst them members of nobility, also migrated voluntarily over the centuries, as well as some that moved as muhajirs in the 19th century to Iran, following the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. The Georgian community of Fereydunshahr have retained their distinct Georgian identity until this day, while having to adopt aspects of Iranian culture such as the Persian language and Twelver Shia Islam in order to survive in the society.\n\nMost likely, the first extant community of Georgians within Iran was formed following Shah Tahmasp I's invasions of Georgia and the rest of the Caucasus, in which he deported some 30,000 Georgians and other Caucasians back to mainland Safavid Iran. The first genuine compact Georgian settlements however appeared in Iran in the 1610s when Shah Abbas I relocated some two hundred thousand from their historical homeland, eastern Georgian provinces of Kakheti and Kartli, following a punitive campaign he conducted against his formerly most loyal Georgian servants, namely Teimuraz I of Kakheti and Luarsab II of Kartli. Most of modern-day Iranian Georgians are the latters' descendants, although the first large movements of Georgians from the Caucasus to the heartland of the Safavid empire in Iran happened as early as during the rule of Tahmasp I. Subsequent waves of large deportations after Abbas also occurred throughout the rest of the 17th, but also the 18th and 19th centuries, the last ones by the Qajar Dynasty. A certain amount also migrated as muhajirs in the 19th century to Iran, following the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. \nThe Georgian deportees were settled by the Shah's government into the scarcely populated lands which were quickly made by their new inhabitants into the lively agricultural areas. Many of these new settlements were given Georgian names, reflecting the toponyms found in Georgia. During the Safavid era, Georgia became so politically and somewhat culturally intertwined with Iran that Georgians replaced the Qizilbash among the Safavid officials, alongside the Circassians and Armenians.\n\nDuring his travels the Italian adventurer Pietro Della Valle claimed that there was no household in Persia without its Georgian slaves, noticing the huge amounts of Georgians present everywhere in society. The later Safavid capital, Isfahan, was home to many Georgians. Many of the city’s inhabitants were of Georgian, Circassian, and Daghistani descent. Engelbert Kaempfer, who was in Safavid Persia in 1684-85, estimated their number at 20,000. Following an agreement between Shah Abbas I and his Georgian subject Teimuraz I of Kakheti (\"Tahmuras Khan\"), whereby the latter submitted to Safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region’s wāli (governor) and for having his son serve as dāruḡa (\"prefect\") of Isfahan in perpetuity, a Georgian prince converted to Islam served as governor. He was accompanied by a certain number of soldiers, and they spoke in Georgian among themselves. There must also have been some Georgian Orthodox Christians. The royal court in Isfahan had a great number of Georgian ḡolāms (military slaves) as well as Georgian women. Although they spoke Persian or Turkic, their mother tongue was Georgian.\n\nDuring the last days of the Safavid empire, the Safavids arch enemy, namely the neighboring Ottoman Turks, as well as neighboring Imperial Russia, but also the tribal Afghans from the far off easternmost regions of the empire took advantage of Iranian internal weakness and invaded Iran.\nThe Iranian Georgian contribution in wars against the invading Afghans was crucial. Georgians fought in the battle of Golnabad, and in the battle of Fereydunshahr. In the latter battle they brought a humiliating defeat to the Afghan army.\n\nIn total, the Persian sources mention that during the Safavid era 225,000 Georgians were transplanted to mainland Iran during the first two centuries, while the Georgian sources keep this number at 245,000.\n\nDuring the Afsharid dynasty, 5,000 Georgian families were moved to mainland Iran according to the Persian sources, while the Georgian sources keep it on 30,000 persons.\n\nDuring the Qajar dynasty, the last Iranian empire that would, despite very briefly, have effective control over Georgia, 15,000 Georgians were moved to Iran according to the Persian sources, while the Georgian ones mention 22,000 persons. This last large wave of Georgian movement and settlement towards mainland Iran happened as a result of the Battle of Krtsanisi in 1795.\n\nDespite their isolation from Georgia, many Georgians have preserved their language and some traditions, but embraced Islam. The ethnographer Lado Aghniashvili was first from Georgia to visit this community in 1890.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the Georgian minority in Iran was caught in the pressures of the rising Cold War. In 1945, this compact ethnic community, along with other ethnic minorities that populated northern Iran, came to the attention of the Soviet as a possible instrument for fomenting unrest in Iranian domestic politics. While the Soviet Georgian leadership wanted to repatriate them to Georgia, Moscow clearly preferred to keep them in Iran. The Soviet plans were abandoned only after Joseph Stalin realized that his plans to obtain influence in northern Iran foiled by both Iranian stubbornness and United States pressure.\n\nIn June 2004, the new Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, became the first Georgian politician to have visited the Iranian Georgian community in Fereydunshahr. Thousands of local Georgians gave the delegation a warm welcome, which included waving of the newly adopted Georgian national flag with its five crosses. Saakashvili who stressed that the Iranian Georgians have historically played an important role in defending Iran put flowers on the graves of the Iranian Georgian dead of the eight years long Iran–Iraq War.\n\nMany Iranian military commanders and administrators were (Islamized) Georgians. Many members of the Safavid and Qajar dynasties and nobility had Georgian blood. In fact, the heavily mixed Safavid dynasty (1501-1736) was of partial Georgian origins from its very beginning.\n\nMilitary: Allahverdi Khan, Otar Beg Orbeliani, Rustam Khan the \"sipahsalar\", Imam-Quli Khan, Yusef Khan-e Gorji, Grigor Mikeladze, Konstantin Mikeladze, Daud Khan Undiladze, Rustam Khan the \"qullar-aqasi\", Eskandar Mirza (d. 1711), Bektash of Kakheti, Kaikhosro of Kartli, Shah-Quli Khan (Levan of Kartli), Eskandar Mirza (Prince Aleksandre of Georgia), Prince Rostom of Kartli, Vsevolod Starosselsky\n\nArts: Aliquli Jabbadar, Antoin Sevruguin, Nima Yooshij, Siyâvash, Ahmad Beg Gorji Aktar (fl. 1819) and his brother Mohammad-Baqer Beg \"Nasati”,\n\nRoyalty/nobility: Bijan Beg Saakadze, Semayun Khan (Simon II of Kartli), Otar Beg Orbeliani, Abd-ol-Ghaffar Amilakhori, Sohrab I, Duke of Araghvi (Zurab), Pishkinid dynasty, Haydar Mirza Safavi, Safi of Persia, Dowlatshah, Gurgin Khan (George XI of Kartli), Imām Qulī Khān (David II of Kakheti), Bagrat Khan (Bagrat VII), Constantine Khan (Constantine I), Mahmād Qulī Khān (Constantine II of Kakheti), Ivan Aleksandrovich Bagration, Nazar Alī Khān (Heraclius I of Kakheti), 'Isa Khan Gorji (Prince Jesse of Kakheti), Isā Khān (Jesse of Kakheti), Princess Ketevan of Kakheti, Shah-Quli Khan (Levan of Kartli), Manuchar II Jaqeli, Eskandar Mirza (Prince Aleksandre of Georgia), Shah Nawaz (Vakhtang V of Kartli), Mustafa, fourth son of Tahmasp I, Heydar Ali, third son of Tahmasp I.\n\nAcademics: Parsadan Gorgijanidze, Jamshid Giunashvili\n\nPoliticians/officials: Shahverdi Khan (Georgian), Manouchehr Khan Gorji (\"Motamed-od-dowleh\"), Amin al-Sultan, Bahram Aryana, Vakhushti Khan Orbeliani, Ahmad ibn Nizam al-Mulk, Ishaq Beg (Alexander of Kartli, d. 1773), Bijan Beg (son of Rustam Khan the \"sipahsalar\"), 'Isa Khan Gorji, Otar Beg Orbeliani,\n\nOthers: Undiladze, Mahmoud Karimi Sibaki\n\nThe names of actors Cyrus Gorjestani and Sima Gorjestani, as well as the late Nematollah Gorji, suggest that they are/were (at least from the paternal side) of Georgian origin.

The Iranian-Australian University Professor, Dr Leila Karimi, born in a Georgian Family (originally known as Goginashvili) in Isfahan.\n\nFor a more lengthy discussion on Georgians and Persia refer to.\n\nThe Georgian language is still used by a minority of people in Iran. The center of Georgians in Iran is Fereydunshahr, a small city, 150 km to the west of Isfahan in the area historically known as Fereydan. In this area there are 10 Georgian towns and villages around Fereydunshahr. In this region the old Georgian identity is retained the best compared to other places in Iran, and most people speak and understand the Georgian language there.\n\nThere were other compact settlements in Khorasan at Abbas Abad (half-way between Shahrud and Sabzevar where there remained only one old woman who remembered Georgian in 1934), Mazandaran at Behshahr and Farah Abad, Gilan, Isfahan Province at Najafabad, Badrud, Rahmatabad, Yazdanshahr and Amir Abad. These areas are frequently called Gorji Mahalleh (\"Georgian neighborhood\"). Many Georgians or Iranians of partial Georgian descent are also scattered in major Iranian cities, such as Tehran, Isfahan, Rasht, Karaj and Shiraz. \n\nMost of these communities no longer speak the Georgian language, but retain aspects of Georgian culture and keep a Georgian conscious. Some argue that Iranian Georgians retain remnants of Christian traditions, but there is no evidence for this. Most Georgians in Fereydunshahr and Fereydan speak and understand Georgian. Iranian Georgians observe the Shia traditions and also non-religious traditions similar to other people in Iran. They observe the traditions of Nowruz.\n\nThe local self-designation of Georgians in Iran, like the rest of the Georgians over the world is \"Kartveli\" (, from Kartvelebi, Georgian: ქართველები, namely \"Georgians\"), although occasionally the ethonyms Gorj, Gorji, or even Gurj-i (from Persian \"Gorji\" which means Georgian). They call their language Kartuli (Georgian: ქართული). As Rezvani states, this is not surprising given that all other Georgian dialects in Iran are extinct.\n\nThe number of Georgians in Iran is estimated to be over 100,000. According to Encyclopaedia Georgiana (1986) some 12,000–14,000 lived in rural Fereydan c. 1896, and a more recent estimation cited by Rezvani (published 2009, written in 2008) states that there may be more than 61,000 Georgians in Fereydan. Modern-day estimations regarding the number of Iranian Georgians are that they compose over 100,000, but these numbers are obvious underestimations as it is believed that the modern Iranian Georgians are more than Georgians in Georgia. (3,500,000 +). They are also the largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation, ahead of the Circassians.\n\n\n\n"}

A distinct group of Lori were musicians and entertainers. Each occupational group is distinguished by a special appellation, for example the carpenter is known as a dar trash Lori, the blacksmith is known as asinkar Lori, and a goldsmith is known as a zargar Lori. While those groups involved in entertainment are known as dohli, or drummers and are a strictly endogamous group. The dholi are also involved in jugglery, palmistry and fortune telling.

{"id": "6392666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6392666", "title": "Mon kingdoms", "text": "Mon kingdoms\n\nMon kingdoms were political establishments by the Mon-speaking people that ruled large sections of present-day Burma (Myanmar) at various times in the last 1200 years. The kingdoms in chronological order are the Thaton Kingdom (9th century–1057), the Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1287–1539), and the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1740–1757).\n\nThe first recorded kingdom attributed to the Mon people is Dvaravati, which prospered until around 1000 CE when their capital was sacked by the Khmer Empire and a significant portion of the inhabitants fled west to present-day Lower Burma and eventually founded new polities.\n\nMainstream scholarship holds that the Mon established small polities (or large city-states) in Lower Burma. Both the city of Thaton and Pegu (Bago) are believed to have been established in the 9th century. The states were important trading ports between Indian Ocean and mainland Southeast Asia. Still, according to traditional reconstruction, the early Mon city-states were conquered by the Pagan Kingdom from the north in 1057, and that Thaton's literary and religious traditions helped to mould early Pagan civilisation. Between 1050 and about 1085, Mon craftsmen and artisans helped to build some two thousand monuments at Pagan, the remains of which today rival the splendors of Angkor Wat. The Mon script is considered to be the source of the Burmese script, the earliest evidence of which was dated to 1058, a year after the Thaton conquest, by the colonial era scholarship.\n\nHowever, recent research—still a minority view—argues that Mon influence on the interior after Anawrahta's conquest is a greatly exaggerated post-Pagan legend, and that Lower Burma in fact lacked a substantial independent polity prior to Pagan's expansion. Possibly in this period, the delta sedimentation—which now extends the coastline by a century—remained insufficient, and the sea still reached too far inland, to support a population even as large as the modest population of the late precolonial era. (The earliest evidence of Burmese script is dated to 1035, and possibly as early as 984 CE. Recent research argues that the Pyu script was the source of the Burmese script.)\n\nThough the size and importance of these states are still debated, all scholars accept that during the 11th century, Pagan established its authority in Lower Burma and this conquest facilitated growing cultural exchange, if not with local Mon, then with India and with Theravada stronghold Sri Lanka. From a geopolitical standpoint, Anawrahta's conquest of Thaton checked the Khmer advance in the Tenasserim coast.\n\nIn 1287, the Pagan Empire collapsed due to Mongol invasions, and all its vassal states became independent. In present-day Lower Burma, Wareru established a kingdom for the Mon-speaking people called Ramannadesa by unifying three Mon-speaking regions of Lower Burma: Martaban (Mottama), Pegu (Bago), the Irrawaddy delta. The kingdom's first capital was at Martaban but the capital was moved to Pegu in 1369.\n\nFor its first 100 years, the kingdom was merely a loose collection of three Mon-speaking regions. The high kings at the capital had little substantive authority over the vassals. Indeed, Martaban was in open rebellion from 1363 to 1389. A more centralised rule came with the reign of King Razadarit, who not only firmly unified the three Mon-speaking regions together but also successfully fended off the northern Burmese-speaking Kingdom of Ava in the Forty Years' War (1385–1424). The war ended in a stalemate but it was a victory for Hanthawaddy as Ava finally gave up its dream of restoring the Pagan Empire. In the years following the war, Pegu occasionally aided Ava's southern vassal states of Prome and Toungoo in their rebellions but carefully avoided getting plunged into a full-scale war.\n\nAfter the war, Hanthawaddy entered its golden age whereas its rival Ava gradually went into decline. From the 1420s to the 1530s, Hanthawaddy was the most powerful and prosperous kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms. Under a string of especially gifted monarchs—Binnya Ran I, Shin Sawbu, Dhammazedi and Binnya Ran II—the kingdom enjoyed a long golden age, profiting from foreign commerce. Its merchants traded with traders from across the Indian Ocean, filling the king's treasury with gold and silver, silk and spices, and all the other stuff of early modern trade. The kingdom also became a famous centre of Theravada Buddhism. It established strong ties with Ceylon, and encouraged reforms that later spread throughout the country.\n\nThe powerful kingdom's end came abruptly. Due to the inexperience of King Takayutpi, the kingdom was captured by a smaller kingdom to the north, Kingdom of Toungoo in 1539 led by King Tabinshwehti and his deputy Gen. Bayinnaung. Toungoo captured the Irrawaddy delta and Pegu in 1538–1539, and Martaban in 1541. The kingdom was briefly revived in 1550 after Tabinshwehti was assassinated. But Bayinnaung quickly defeated the rebellion in 1552.\n\nThough Toungoo kings would rule all of Lower Burma well into the mid-18th century, the golden age of Hanthawaddy was fondly remembered by the Mon. In 1740, they rose up against a weak Toungoo Dynasty on its last legs, and succeeded in restoring the fallen Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Supported by the French, the upstart kingdom quickly carved out a space for itself in Lower Burma, and continued its push northward. On 23 March 1752, its forces captured Ava, and ended the 266-year-old Toungoo dynasty.\n\nA new dynasty called Konbaung led by King Alaungpaya rose in Upper Burma to challenge the southern forces, and went on to conquer all of Upper Burma by January 1754. After Hanthawaddy's second invasion of Upper Burma failed in May 1754, the kingdom's leadership in self-defeating measures killed off the Toungoo royal family, and persecuted ethnic Burmans in the south, both of which only strengthened Alaungpaya's hand. In 1755, Alaungpaya invaded Lower Burma. Konbaung forces captured the Irrawaddy delta in May 1755, the French defended port of Thanlyin in July 1756, and finally the capital Pegu in May 1757.\n\nThe fall of Restored Hanthawaddy was the beginning of the end of Mon people's centuries-old dominance of Lower Burma. Konbaung armies' reprisals forced thousands of Mons to flee to Siam. By the early 19th century, assimilation, inter-marriage, and mass migration of Burman families from the north had reduced the Mon population to a small minority.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 2004 as the Kabul Bank, the first private bank in Afghanistan. After corruption and scandals it was re-established in 2011 as the New Kabul Bank. \n\nIt is the main bank used to pay the salaries of the national army and security police forces. The bank provides facilities to maintain accounts in Current, Savings Bank, and Fixed Deposits; and offers its consumers branch and automated teller machine services. The bank is under the supervision of the Central Bank of Afghanistan (\"Da Afghanistan Bank−DAB\"), the General Directorate of Treasury, and the Afghanistan Ministry of Finance (MOF).\n\nThe Kabul Bank was established in 2004. \n\nKabul Bank claims that accounts can be opened and maintained in afghani, U.S. dollars and euro. Kabul Bank claims that it is connected throughout the globe with SWIFT facility, which enables fund transfer for its customers. The bank has correspondent relationship with seven international banks situated in Germany, China, Iran, Tajikistan, Saudi Arabia and India.\n\nKabul Bank was badly shaken and almost collapsed in 2011, in one of \"the worst banking scandals in history,\" according to \"The Guardian\" newspaper. In late 2012, according to the \"Los Angeles Times\", independent investigators and journalists uncovered widespread corruption in Kabul Bank. \"The New York Times\", in 2012, headlines indicate \"Audit Says Kabul Bank Began as ‘Ponzi Scheme’\" following investigation and judicial action in the aftermath of the Bank's crisis and scandal.\n\nIn 2010, it was disclosed that its Chairman Sherkhan Farnood and other insiders were spending the bank's US$1 billion for their own personal lavish style living and lending money under the table to family, relatives and friends. The bank scandal also involved members of Afghan President Karzai's family, including his brother Mahmood Karzai. In September 2010, one of the principal owners of the bank, said that depositors had withdrawn $180 million in two days and predicted a \"revolution\" in the country's financial system unless the Afghan government and the United States moved quickly to help stabilize the bank. In November 2010, reports appeared that Farnood and chief executive Khalilullah Frozi both had been sacked from duties; as of early 2011 both were effectively under house arrest and could not leave the country, and in July 2011 both were formally arrested and detained in Kabul. DAB stated in February 2011, it would seek to sell Kabul Bank within three years once it was rehabilitated, but both the International Monetary Fund and US officials subsequently pressed for a rapid wind down of the institution. A USAID inspector general report estimated that fraudulent loans diverted $850 million to bank insiders. By October 2011, more than a year after the government seized control, officials had recovered less than 10 percent of the nearly $1 billion that went missing.\n\nAfter only six years in operation, in 2010 there was a panic of customers seeking to withdraw their savings from the bank. Despite nearly $1 billion in U.S. taxpayers' funded assistance in the form of Afghan government salaries deposited into Kabul Bank. Kabul Bank was on the brink of collapse and mobs of customers massed outside of bank locations trying to get their deposits out of the bank with limited luck.\n\nDespite Kabul Bank's near collapse in 2010 during the corruption allegations, Kabul Bank claims it is significant to Afghanistan's internal security and stability because it is the vehicle used to pay, largely with money supplied by the United States government, as many as 300,000 Afghan government employees, mostly military and police, who are key to plans to rebuild Afghanistan's capacity to deal with its ongoing Taliban-led insurgency. President Karzai's brother, Mahmood Karzai, is reported to have played a significant role in the back scandal, and is alleged to have received millions of dollars in loans from Kabul Bank. He was later alleged to be under investigation by a U.S. Federal Grand Jury and U.S. tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for tax evasion allegations. Canada's \"Maclean's\" magazine reported that Mahmoud Karzai was being investigated for racketeering. extortion and tax evasion as a result of connections to the Bank and Hamid Karzai.\n\nDuring the bank scandal and panic in September 2010, hundreds of Afghans, including many civil servants and their families, gathered outside Kabul Bank offices in the capital and elsewhere in Afghanistan. Long lines formed of depositors hoping to withdrawal some or all of their money. Afghan police beat back mobs at the Kabul Bank worried their money would be lost according to the \"Washington Post\". Panic set in among many depositors according to reports by the \"New York Times\".\n\nOn December 27, 2010, a suicide car bomber killed at least three Afghans, including one policeman, as he targeted police officers who lined up to withdraw their salaries in front of Kabul Bank in central Kandahar; the midday explosion also wounded 16 policemen and five civilians, officials said.\n\nOn February 19, 2011, at least 38 people (including 13 policemen) were killed during an insurgent raid on a branch of Kabul Bank in Jalalabad, the provincial capital of Nangarhar, and at least three militants were killed, officials said. Three suicide bombers reportedly entered the bank and detonated themselves, and fighting between insurgents and security forces continued for over four hours; President Hamid Karzai and a NATO International Security Assistance Force spokesman condemned the attack, which was the deadliest in the country since June 2010.\n\nIn its July 2011 review of the Kabul Bank scandal and its aftermath, international non-governmental organization (NGO) Transparency International has raised repeated concerns about problems of corruption in Afghanistan and its impact on the economy, business investment, security and civil society.\n\nIn early 2010, the \"Washington Post\" reported that the Kabul Bank played a part in \"a crony capitalism that enriches politically connected insiders and dismays the Afghan populace.\"\n\nAt the beginning of September, Frozi, one of the two largest shareholders of Kabul Bank, said reports indicating that the institution had lost as much as $300 million were overstated. But he predicted that if Afghan depositors continued to withdraw their money at the current rate, Kabul Bank would almost certainly collapse, undermining confidence in the nascent financial system the Afghans have been trying to build with American help. \"If this goes on, we won’t survive\", Mr. Frozi said in an interview. \"If people lose trust in the banks, there will be a revolution in the financial system.\"\n\nAfghan leaders promised to guarantee deposits in an attempt to arrest the panic, which began at the end of August 2010 when the country's top banking officials demanded the resignations of both Frozi and Farnood. \"The government has decided that there will be an audit firm that will be coming to audit not only Kabul Bank accounts but also other private banks in Afghanistan\", an Afghan presidential spokesman announced in late October. Earlier in the month, the government also froze assets held by some of Kabul Bank's owners even as the central bank governor said it was solvent and had the backing of Karzai's administration. U.S.-educated economist Hamidullah Farooqi, a former Karzai minister and Chairman of the Afghanistan International Chamber of Commerce, said Afghanistan received a \"massive wake-up call\" from the crisis, further stating: \"It's not just a lack of capacity in our institutions, there is a lack of laws and a lack of accountability, which is much more serious. It's a case of the blind leading the blind. They are too young, they are babies.\"\n\nMahmood Karzai is one of the brothers of the Afghan President Hamid Karzai and a seven percent shareholder in the bank. In a telephone interview with the \"Boston Globe\" in September 2010, he said: \"America should do something.\" In October, the \"Washington Post\" reported that Mahmood Karzai could soon be indicted for tax evasion in the U.S., though he denied the charges, telling the newspaper: \"I'm very clean\", and insisting his only interest was \"rebuilding Afghanistan.\"\n\nIn mid-January 2011, acting chief financial officer Rana Tayyab Tahir and other Pakistani employees of Kabul Bank fled to Pakistan, apparently out of fear for their lives and possible arrest, though some said they were being made scapegoats for powerful shareholders. Afghan authorities also called in several bank managers, including foreigners, for questioning and detained some in southern Afghanistan's Helmand Province in connection with illicit transfers of bank funds.\n\nIn early February 2011, DAB Governor Abdul Qadir Fitrat said the central bank would impose stricter rules on banks wanting to handle about US$1.5 billion worth of salaries for government and security officials, which until now has been done by Kabul Bank. Fitrat also told Reuters the total amount of money at risk over suspected irregularities at Kabul Bank amounted to $579 million, almost twice the figure estimated when the bank's troubles first surfaced. Fitrat dismissed concerns that it faced liquidation, saying it would be privately owned again within three years. \"Kabulbank is stabilised, it has enough cash at its disposal and the central bank is trying to rehabilitate the bank and then at some point sell it to potential buyers in two or three years,\" Fitrat told Reuters. In early July 2011, Fitrat resigned as head of the central bank after fleeing to the United States, claiming his life had been threatened and that he was being made a scapegoat for politically connected individuals.\n\nAfter a mid-February 2011 visit by Neal Wolin, the U.S. deputy Treasury secretary, the Afghan finance ministry said that weak international support had exacerbated the crisis. “Afghan and US officials agreed that (the crisis)... was compounded by the erroneous audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers, and ineffective international technical assistance and supervision,” the ministry said. However, Wolin pressed the government to rapidly place the lender into receivership, echoing calls made by a previous International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation. “The deputy secretary... stressed the need for the Afghan government to take swift and decisive action to ensure a credible, effective resolution of issues related to Kabul Bank,\" the U.S. embassy said in statement. Kabul Bank was put into receivership following the scandal and a new bank set up, but only $70 million of fraudulent loans it granted have so far been recovered, with criminal investigations ongoing. In October 2011, Afghanistan's parliament approved a $51 million payment to DAB as part of a planned compensation package over its multi-million-dollar bailout; the payment is part of a package of government measures agreed with the IMF to secure a new loan. Afghanistan has been without an IMF program since the Kabul Bank failure, but the IMF announced that it is moving ahead on a new $129 million loan in the wake of the government's reform promises, with a new program expected to be submitted to the IMF executive board for approval in November 2011.\n\nAt the end of June 2011, the \"Washington Post\" reported that Farnood and Frozi used fake names, forged documents, fictitious companies and secret records as part of an elaborate ruse to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to shareholders and top Afghan officials, including President Karzai's brother Mahmood and Mohammed Fahim, the country's first vice president. Both Farnood and Frozi were arrested in Kabul and held without charge, even though Afghanistan's attorney general said the evidence against them was \"quite clear.\" Without a successful resolution of Kabul Bank’s problems, one senior U.S. official said Afghanistan could face \"the collapse of the banking sector.\" As of October 2011, neither man had yet been charged with a crime, but Deputy Attorney General Enayatullah Nazari said the government intends to bring them to court.\n\n“A crime has happened,” Nazari said. “They will go to the court whether they manage to secure the money or not.” Authorities loosened the terms of their detention and provided them with a security detail to go to a bank office on workdays and on occasion to fancy restaurants and hotels for what Nazari described as work meetings.\n\nWith regard to public sector corruption in Afghanistan and the loss of nearly U.S. $1 billion in U.S. taxpayers' funded foreign assistance to Afghanistan in the form of U.S.-supplied Afghan government and Afghan military and police salaries deposited into Kabul Bank, \"The New Yorker Magazine\", the \"Wall Street Journal\", the \"New York Times\", \"National Public Radio\" (NPR) and others, have reported that widespread corruption, ponzi schemes, fraudulent loans, mass looting, insider loans to fake and bogus companies run by family and friends, and other corrupted practices, were undertaken by a small group of Afghan insiders (less than 12 people), apparently linked to Mahmoud Karzai, President Hamid Karzai and Ahmed Wali Karzai. This resulted in nearly $1 billion ($900 million) in Kabul Bank's deposits seemingly vanishing into Dubai and other off-shore locations and unknown offshore bank accounts and tax havens. Hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars were often smuggled and flown out of Afghanistan secretly stashed in bags and airline food trays \n\nOn November 28, 2012, the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee published its report and declared in a news conference that US$5 billion, including $400 million the Kabul Bank’s shareholders, were illegally transferred abroad. About 22 people are accused of embezzlement in the case, and their trial started. At three hearings, 18 people, including Sher Khan Farnood and Khalil Ferozi, appeared before the court to defend themselves. Some $935 million of the bank assets was transferred abroad through various systems and $825 million are needed to bail out the bank. The Afghan government will have to pay 5-6% of its GDP to save the bank, which would be a huge blow to the country’s economy.\n\nSince 2011, the Karzai Government has rejected banking oversight and reform efforts by the United States in the wake of the Kabul Bank scandal and collapse according to reports by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in 2013-14.\n\nBanking experts, economists and humanitarian aid officials have expressed serious concern about this development given Kabul Bank's large and historic dependence on U.S. taxpayers' funding of bank deposits via payments of the Afghan National Army soldiers, police and Afghanistan's civil service employees who are largely paid with billions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Karzai government and to Afghanistan from the U.S. Congress, U.S. Treasury and ultimately U.S. taxpayer. \n\nThe U.S. government has found anti-corruption efforts in Afghanistan in the wake of the Kabul Bank crisis as deeply troubling, including the banking sector, according to reports by the Washington Post in 2012 and SIGAR. \n\nIn January 2014, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) representative Wabel Abdallah, who assisted in the Kabul Bank crisis aftermath, was murdered by suicide bombers and gunmen in Kabul along with some 21 others in a high profile attack that the Taliban said they undertook. Abdallah headed the IMF's office in Afghanistan since 2008.\n\nFollowing the departure of Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai in 2014, President Ashraf Ghani re-opened efforts to bring former Kabul Bank officials involved in the Kabul Bank Crisis to justice, extend and enforce prison sentences for those previously convicted, and seek to recover hundreds of millions of U.S. and Afghan taxpayers' dollars in funds stolen or lost by embezzlement, corruption, and fraud by the bank's insiders. Ghani vowed to seek to continue the investigation of the Kabul Bank crisis and fight corruption in Afghanistan. In October 2014, the Ghani Administration in Kabul reportedly officially re-opened the investigation.\n\nAfter corruption and scandals it was re-established in 2011 as the New Kabul Bank.\n\nIn 2011, 38 customers at the bank's branch in Jalalabad were killed by a Taliban bombing. Fighting with security forces lasted four hours, and four of the attackers were killed. Two men were later charged for the attack and executed in June 2011. A third person was sentenced to prison.\n\nIn September 2010, the Afghan Central Bank said it was prepared to provide loans to the Kabul Bank, \"if it requests\". After the bailout by the government, by 2015, authorities were inviting bids to privatize the new bank. In 2016, Afghanistan's Joint-Stock Company offered to buy New Kabul Bank for $31 million. Pakistan's MCB Bank also made a bid, as New Kabul Bank was to be privatized in October 2018.\nIn April 2015, the Islamic State or an associated group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing at the entrance of a New Kabul Bank branch in Jalalabad, where government workers waited in line to collect salaries. 34 people were killed at least, and 125 injured. In June 2017, a Taliban suicide bomber killed 29 people at a Kabul Bank branch in the Helmand province.\n\nIn August 2017, there were reports of long lines and slow services at the New Kabul Bank branch in the Paktika province, where it was the only bank in the region. That month, a suicide bomber targeted the Kabul Bank branch entrance close to the US embassy, resulting in five reported deaths. The Taliban claimed responsibility.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15673722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15673722", "title": "Participation bias", "text": "Participation bias\n\nParticipation bias or non-response bias is a phenomenon in which the results of elections, studies, polls, etc. become non-representative because the participants disproportionately possess certain traits which affect the outcome. These traits mean the sample is systematically different from the target population, potentially resulting in biased estimates. \n\nFor instance, a study found that those who refused to answer a survey on AIDS tended to be \"older, attend church more often, are less likely to believe in the confidentiality of surveys, and have lower sexual self disclosure.\" It may occur due to several factors as outlined in Deming (1990).\n\nNon-response bias can be a problem in longitudinal research due to attrition during the study.\n\nIf one selects a sample of 1000 managers in a field and polls them about their workload, the managers with a high workload may not answer the survey because they do not have enough time to answer it, and/or those with a low workload may decline to respond for fear that their supervisors or colleagues will perceive them as surplus employees (either immediately, if the survey is non-anonymous, or in the future, should their anonymity be compromised). Therefore, non-response bias may make the measured value for the workload too low, too high, or, if the effects of the above biases happen to offset each other, \"right for the wrong reasons.\" For a simple example of this effect, consider a survey that includes, \"Agree or disagree: I have enough time in my day to complete a survey.\"\n\nIn the 1936 U.S. presidential election, \"The Literary Digest\" mailed out 10 million questionnaires, of which 2.3 million were returned. Based on this, they predicted that Republican Alf Landon would win with 370 of 531 electoral votes; he actually got 8. Research published in 1976 and 1988 concluded that non-response bias was the primary source of this error, although their sampling frame was also quite different from the vast majority of voters.\nNon responders have been shown to be associated with younger patients, poorer communities and those who are less satisfied and subsequently could be a source of bias by a study published by Imam et al. in 2014.\n\nThere are different ways to test for non-response bias. A common technique involves comparing the first and fourth quartiles of responses for differences in demographics and key constructs. In e-mail surveys some values are already known from all potential participants (e.g. age, branch of the firm, ...) and can be compared to the values that prevail in the subgroup of those who answered. If there is no significant difference this is an indicator that there might be no non-response bias.\n\nIn e-mail surveys those who didn't answer can also systematically be phoned and a small number of survey questions can be asked. If their answers don't differ significantly from those who answered the survey, there might be no non-response bias. This technique is sometimes called non-response follow-up.\n\nGenerally speaking, the lower the response rate, the greater the likelihood of a non-response bias in play.\n\n\n\n"}

A sub-group of the Kadazan-Dusun, they have a distinctive language, dress, architecture, customs, and oral literature.\n\nAs with most indigenous ethnic groups in Borneo, culture revolves around rice; however, coconut and banana groves provide cash income. Women weave cloth on backstrap looms, and make containers from vine or beadwork. Many Rungus now work in town, and have abandoned the communal life of the longhouse for modern Malaysian society. Traditionally animist, with female shamans, most Rungus are now Christian.\n\nConsidered one of the most traditional ethnic groups in Sabah, many Momogun Rungus live in longhouses, with each family having its own separate quarters off a common hall. At the edge of the communal hall, a well-ventilated platform of split bamboo with outward sloping walls provides a place for socialising and communal work. The Rungus longhouse is quite different from the Murut longhouse. The houses are not perched on high stilts, but are usually only three to five feet above ground. The roof is low, and the walls are outward sloped. In olden times, longhouses of over 75 doors are said to have been common. Now, they rarely exceed 10 doors. Usually single story, more modern two-story versions of the longhouse also exist. Single-family houses are sometimes built near the longhouse – these take the same form, but are curiously short, looking like a slice from a cake.\n\nThe traditional Rungus dress is black in colour, often with hundreds or even thousands of dollars worth of antique beads. Traditionally all of the Rungus women wore heavy brass coils around their arms, legs and necks. Brass arm coils are often accompanied by white and coral shell bracelets. Rings of brass may also be worn around the waist.\n\nThis beadwork and its designs easily distinguish the Rungus from the other ethnic groups of Sabah. \"The beadwork often tells a story and this one in particular tells of a man going spear-hunting for a riverine creature\". The \"pinakol\" consists of a pair of flat beaded bandoleer-type belts worn crossed over the chest and back.\n\nThe \"sandang\" is a pair of long beaded strands, mostly with matching beads. These are worn crossed over the chest like the \"pinakol\".\nThe \"sullau\" is a flat beaded choker worn around the neck with two clamshell discs, one in front and one in back. Small bells are attached in the front. They make the discs out of plastic nowaday The \"tinggot\" is a short choker, either single beaded or with narrow beadwork. Men and women wear these.\nThe \"togkul\" is a necklace some 26 inches (66 cm) long with beads similar to the \"sandang\" but smaller and worn around the neck.\nThe \"sisingal\" is a narrow beaded band worn around the head.\nThe \"rampai\" is made of cotton, flowers and beads worked into the hair.\nThe \"orot\". \"Little brass rings and antique beads looped through thin strands of stripped bark \"(togung)\" becomes a wide and colorful hipband. To wear this the \"orot\" is slowly and carefully coiled around the hip. Then a last string of beads \"(Llobokon)\" is hung loosely from the coil. The \"orot\" is hand made by the Rungus men as the technique is known only to them\".\n\nThe \"bobolizan\" originates with the Tuaran Lotud group of Sabah, but according to Rose Sabala sometimes Rungus wear \"bobolizan\" to talk to spirits in the old language.\n\nThere are also \"sad'ang\", earrings that sometimes have beads attached.\n\nMany of the beads used by the Rungus are plastic and glass imitations of older heirloom beads. Materials such as plastic spoons were heated over a flame and the hot plastic are then winded onto a metal rod to make yellow beads.\n\nRungus cuisine is mainly prepared using cooking methods like braising, grilling and baking. Being a community of fishermen and farmers, the staple foods of the Rungus people usually consists of rice and cassava, supplemented with green vegetables and fish. \n\n\"Tinunuvan soguntung\" is the Rungus term for a preparation of grilled or roasted eggplant. The cooked eggplant is peeled, and served with chillies, lime juice, toasted ikan bilis or salted fish, and sprigs of \"lompodos\" (a local variety of basil). \n\n\"Tinonggilan\" is a slightly sparkling alcoholic drink made from maize. Akin to the Latin American corn beer, \"Tinonggilan\" is a Rungus speciality and is usually served during festive occasions, or as refreshments for guests during the performance of a ritual dance called \"Mongigol Sumundai\".\n\nThe Rungus also prepare simple sweet foods such as flatbread made from sweetened grated cassava (\"tinopis runti\") and \"bintanok dalai\", or mashed corn wrapped and steamed in corn husks. These are to be consumed for breakfast or as snacks. \n\nLike the Kadazan-Dusun, Rungus people also celebrate Kaamatan. This festival is usually celebrated on 31 May every year. Even though there are many similarities the way of celebration between this two race but there is also comparison.\n\n"}
{"id": "48264425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48264425", "title": "Safe Campus Act", "text": "Safe Campus Act\n\nThe Safe Campus Act () was introduced to the US House of Representatives by Matt Salmon (R-AZ), Pete Sessions (R-TX), and Kay Granger (R-TX) on July 29, 2015. The bill aims to prevent colleges from pursuing internal investigations in cases of campus sexual assault. This restriction would legally require alleged victims of sexual assault to report the crime to the police in order to see justice on campus.\n\nThe Safe Campus Act would require schools to report each allegation of sexual violence to local law enforcement for investigation after obtaining written consent from the alleged victim. Schools would be required to wait for the results of a law enforcement investigation before beginning their own internal disciplinary procedures and would not be allowed to punish the accused in cases where the alleged victim did not consent to a law enforcement investigation. In cases where deemed necessary to protect the safety of the alleged victim, schools would be permitted to impose interim measures such as temporary suspensions, no contact orders, adjustments to class schedules, and changes in housing assignments. These interim measures would be lifted after the completion of the law enforcement investigation if it did not result in an indictment. Alleged victims would have the right to submit a joint request with law enforcement for interim measures if both agreed that they would not protect the safety of the alleged victim, and schools would be required to honor such a request. Students would be protected from being disciplined for violations of school rules that came to light as a result of their reporting of sexual violence.\n\nThe Safe Campus Act would require a formal hearing before students could be disciplined for sexual violence. Schools would be required to provide all parties with at least two weeks notice before the hearing. Both the accused and the alleged victim would have the right to an attorney at their own expense, the right to access all evidence, and the right to cross-examination, although such cross-examination would be prohibited from including any questions on the sexual history of the alleged victim. Schools would be required to ensure that those adjudicating allegations do not have conflicts of interest. Students who are found responsible for sexual violence would have the right to judicial review of that decision. Schools would be required to publish their procedures for adjudicating allegations of sexual violence in their student handbooks.\n\nThe Safe Campus Act requires universities to educate all adult and student staff on sexual assault and reporting. It also encourages but does not require the university to provide sexual assault education to the students. Universities must allocate funds to these programs and for programs to help victims of sexual assault on campus.\n\nThe provision requiring an alleged victim to report an act of sexual violence to law enforcement before the accused student could be punished has generated controversy.\n\nThe bill's opponents point to low reporting rates in cases of sexual assault and insist forced reporting to the police will inhibit even more victims from coming forward as victims of a sexual crime. Opponents also point out that this bill singles out sexual assault crimes, as colleges can still punish students with other accusations, even without a criminal investigation. Some of the most outspoken opponents of this bill are the National Panhellenic Conference and the North American Inter-fraternity Conference.\n\nThe Fair Campus Act was introduced shortly after the Safe Campus Act as a response to the criticism of the Safe Campus Act. This bill is very similar but does not require sexual assault victims to report to the police in order for there to be a college investigation, which was the main issue for the opponents of the Safe Campus Act.\n\nSupporters of this bill claim mandatory police reporting will ensure students have access to fair representation during a trial, which may not be the case in a campus hearing, as it does not have criminal implications without the police.\n\nThe Safe Campus Act is supported by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and the National District Attorneys Association.\n\n"}

Some critics contend that it is a violation of capabilities and human rights and can create economic inefficiencies, while some supporters argue that it is central to certain religious laws and social and cultural histories and traditions.\n\nThe term \"sex\" in \"sex segregation\" refers to apparent biological distinctions between men and women, used in contrast to \"gender\". The term \"segregation\" refers to separation of the sexes, which can be enforced by rules, laws, and policies, or be a \"de facto\" outcome in which people are separated by sex. Even as a de facto outcome, \"sex segregation\" taken as a whole can be caused by societal pressures, historical practices, and socialized preferences. Literally, sex segregation can be physical and spatial separation by sex, but the term is also used for the exclusion of one sex from participation in an occupation, institution, or group. Sex segregation can be complete or partial, as when members of one sex predominate within, but do not exclusively constitute, a group or organization.\n\nThe term gender apartheid or (sexual apartheid) also has been applied to segregation of people by gender, implying that it is sexual discrimination. Insofar as sex segregation is a form of sex discrimination, its effects have important consequences for gender equality and equity.\n\nSex segregation can occur in both public and private contexts, and be classified in many ways. Legal and gender studies scholar David S. Cohen offers one taxonomy in categorizing sex segregation as mandatory, administrative, permissive, or voluntary. Mandatory and administrative sex segregation are required and enforced by governments in public environments, while permissive and voluntary sex segregation are stances chosen by public or private institutions, but within the capacity of the law.\n\nMandatory sex segregation is legally required and enforces separation based on sex. Examples include separation of men and women in prisons, law enforcement, military service, restrooms, and housing. These mandatory rules can be nuanced, as in military service, where sexes are often separated in laws about conscription, in housing, and in regulations on which sexes can participate in certain roles, like frontline infantry. Mandatory sex segregation also includes less obvious cases of separation, as when men and women are required to have same-sex attendants for body searches. Mandatory sex segregation can thus dictate parameters for employment in sex segregated spaces, including medical and care work contexts, and can be a form of occupational segregation. For example, a government may mandate that clinics hire female nurses to care for female patients.\n\nAdministrative sex segregation involves public and government institutions segregating by sex in their operating capacity, rather than as the result of a formal mandate. Examples of administrative sex segregation include sex segregation in government sponsored medical research, sports leagues, public hospitals with shared rooms, rehabilitation programs, and some public education facilities. Administrative sex segregation can occur in these environments simply as through the provisioning of sex segregated restrooms despite limited explicit legal requirements to do so.\n\nPermissive sex segregation is segregation which is explicitly permitted by law, i.e. affirmatively authorized, but not necessarily legally required or encouraged. Permissive sex segregation exempts certain things from anti-sex-discrimination laws, often allowing for, among others, segregation of religious and military schools, undergraduate schools that have traditionally admitted based on sex, health clubs, athletic teams, social fraternities and sororities, choirs and choruses, voluntary youth service organizations such as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, father/son and mother/daughter activities, and sex-exclusive beauty pageants and scholarships.\n\nSex segregation that is neither legally mandated, nor enacted in an administrative capacity, nor explicitly permitted by law, is recognized as voluntary sex segregation. Voluntary sex segregation refers to lack of explicit legal prescriptions; it does not necessarily indicate the free choice of either the segregated or the segregators, and it may be imposed by social and cultural norms. Voluntary sex segregation takes place in numerous national professional and interest-based membership organizations, local and larger clubs, professional sports teams, private recreational facilities, religious institutions, performing arts, and more.\n\nWithin feminist theory and feminist legal theory, there are six main theoretical approaches that can be considered and used to analyze the causes and effects of sex segregation. They include libertarianism, equal treatment, difference feminism, anti-subordination, critical race feminism, and anti-essentialism.\n\nLibertarian feminist theory stems from ideologies similar to libertarian political theory; that legal and governmental institutions should not regulate choices and should allow people's free will to govern their life trajectories. Libertarianism takes a free market approach to sex segregation saying that women have a natural right and are the most informed to make decisions for themselves but rejects special protections specifically for women. Autonomy is central to libertarianism, so theorists believe that the government should not interfere with decision making or be concerned with reasoning behind such decisions since men and women culturally and naturally make different and often diverging choices. Policies and laws enforced by the government should not act to change any inherent differences between the sexes. \nLibertarianism most directly relates to voluntary sex segregation as it maintains that the government should not regulate private institutions or entities' segregation by sex and should not regulate how individuals privately group themselves. Libertarian feminist David Berstein argues that while sex segregation can cause harm, guarding the freedom of choice for men and women is more important than preventing such sex segregation since methods of prevention can often cause more harm than good for both sexes. Women's health clubs are an example of how sex segregation benefits women since desegregation would interfere with women's abilities to exercise without the distraction of men and 'ogling' without any direct benefit to allowing men a membership. Additionally, libertarians would allow for permissive sex segregation since it allows people to choose how to organize their interactions and relationships with others.\nLibertarian feminists acknowledge that there is legal precedence for sex segregation laws, but argue for such parameters to ensure equal treatment of similarly situated men and women. As such, libertarianism could allow or reject specific forms of sex segregation created to account for natural or biological differences between the sexes.\n\nEqual treatment theory or formal equity often works in tandem with libertarianism in that equal treatment theorists believe governments should treat men and women similarly when their situations are similar. In countries whose governments have taken to legislation eliminating sex segregation, equal treatment theory is most frequently used as support for such rules and regulation. For example, equal treatment theory was adopted by the many feminists during the United States' feminist movement in the 1970s. This utilization of equal treatment theory led to the adoption of intermediate scrutiny as a standard for sex discrimination on the basis that men and women should be treated equally when in similar situations. While equal treatment theory provides a sound framework for equality, application is quite tricky, as many critics question the standards by which men and women should be treated similarly or differently. In this manner, libertarianism and equal treatment theory provide good foundations for their agendas in sex segregation, but conceptually do not prevent it, leaving room for mandatory and administrative sex segregation to remain as long as separation is based on celebrated differences between men and women. Some forms of mandatory and administrative segregation may perpetuate sex segregation by depicting a difference between male and female employees where there is no such difference, as in combat exclusion policies.\n\nDifference feminism arose from libertarianism and equal treatment theories' perceived failure to create systemic equality for women. Difference feminism celebrates biological, psychological, moral differences between men and women, accusing laws concerning sex segregation of diluting these important differences. Difference feminists believe that such laws not only ignore these important differences, but also can exclude participation of women in the world. Difference feminism's goal is to bring about a consciousness of women's femininity and to cause the revaluation of begin to revalue women's attributes in a more respectful, reverent manner.<br>\nDifference feminism and equal treatment theory are quite contrasting feminist theories of sex segregation. Difference feminism often justifies sex segregation through women's and men's differences while equal treatment theory does not support separation because of differences in sex. Difference feminism, however, argues against segregation that stems from societal and \"old-fashioned\" differences between men and women, but believes that segregation that takes women's differences into account and promotes equality is acceptable, even going so far as to say that some forms of sex segregation are necessary to ensure equality, such as athletics and education, and policies such as Title IX.\n\nAnti-subordination feminist theory examines sex segregation through power to ultimately whether women are treated or placed subordinately compared to men in a law or situation. The theory focuses on male dominance and female subordination and promotes destroying a sex-based hierarchy in legal and social institutions and preventing future hierarchies from arising. Anti-subordination also supports laws that promote the status of women even if they lower men's status as a consequence. Controversial applications of anti-subordination that can either perpetuate the subordination of women or create the subordination of men include sex segregation in education and in the military.\n\nCritical race feminism developed due to the lack of racial inclusivity of feminist theories and lack of gender inclusivity of racial theories. This theory is more global than the others, attempting to take into account the intersectionality of gender and race. Critical race feminism demands that theorists reexamine surface-level segregation and focus on how sex segregation stems from different histories, causing different effects based on race, especially for women of color. This segregation is evident in many racially divided countries, especially in the relationship between the end of race-segregated schools and sex segregation. Critical race feminism critiques other theories' failure to take into account their different applications once race, class, sexual orientation, or other identity factors are included in a segregated situation. It creates the need to examine mandatory and administrative sex segregation to determine whether or if they sustain racial stereotypes, particularly towards women of color. Additionally, critical race feminists wonder whether permissive and voluntary sex segregation are socially acceptable manners by which to separate races and sexes or whether they maintain and perpetuate inequalities. Critical race feminism is a form of anti-essentialism (below).\n\nAnti-essentialists maintain that sex and gender categories are limiting and fail to include the unlimited variety of difference in human identity and impose identities rather than simply note their differences. Theorists believe that there is variation in what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman, and by promoting the differences through sex segregation, people are confined to categories, limiting freedom. Anti-essentialists examine how society imposes specific identities within the sex dichotomy and how subsequently sex and gender hierarchies are created, perpetuated, and normalized. This theory requires that there is a specific disentanglement between sex and gender. Anti-essentialists believe that there should not be an idea of what constitutes masculinity or femininity, but that individual characteristics should be fluid to eliminate sex and gender-based stereotypes. No specific types of sex segregation are outwardly promoted or supported by anti-essentialists since mandatory and administrative sex segregation reinforce power struggles between the sexes and genders while permissive or voluntary forms of sex segregation allow institutions and society to sort individuals into categories with differential access to power, and supporting the government's elimination of such permission for certain institutions and norms to continue to exist.\n\nSex segregation is a global phenomenon manifested differently in varying localities. Sex segregation and integration considered harmless or normal in one country can be considered radical or illegal in others. At the same time, many laws and policies promoting segregation or desegregation recur across multiple national contexts. Safety and privacy concerns, traditional values and cultural norms, and belief that sex segregation can produce positive educational and overall social outcomes all shape public policy regarding sex segregation.\n\nSome sex segregation occurs for reasons of safety and privacy. Worldwide, laws often mandate sex segregation in bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and similar spaces, based on a common perceived need for privacy. This type of segregation policy can protect against sexual harassment and sexual abuse. To combat groping, street harassment, and eve teasing of women in crowded public places, some countries have also designated women only spaces. For example, sex-segregated buses, women-only passenger cars, and compartments on trains have been introduced in Mexico, Japan, the Philippines, the UAE and other countries to reduce sexual harassment. Some places in Germany, Korea, and China all have women's parking spaces, often for related safety issues. Many more countries, including Canada, the United States, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom also grant parking privileges to pregnant women, for safety or access reasons.\n\nSex segregation rooted in safety considerations can furthermore extend beyond the physical to the psychological and emotional as well. A refuge for battered mothers or wives may refuse to admit men, even those who are themselves the victims of domestic violence, both to exclude those who might commit or threaten violence to women and because women who have been subjected to abuse by a male might feel threatened by the presence of any man. Women's health clinics and women's resource centers, whether in Africa or North America, are further examples of spaces where sex segregation may facilitate private and highly personal decisions. Women-only banks may be similarly intended to provide autonomy to women's decision making.\n\nSex segregation can also be motivated by religious or cultural ideas about men and women. Such cultural assumptions may even exist in the aforementioned policies enacted under the pretenses of safety or privacy concerns. Gender separation and segregation in Judaism and Islam reflect religiously motivated sex segregation. In Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism, monastic orders, prayer spaces, and leadership roles have also been segregated by sex.\n\nFrom a policy perspective, theocracies and countries with a state religion have sometimes made sex segregation laws based partially in religious traditions. Even when not legally enforced, such traditions can be reinforced by social institutions and in turn result in sex segregation. In the South Asian context, one institution conducive to sex segregation, sometimes but not always rooted in national law, is purdah.\n\nDuring the Taiping Rebellion (1851-64) against the Qing dynasty, areas controlled by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had strict sex separation enforced. Even married couples were not allowed to live together until 1858.\n\nThe Muslim world and the Middle East have been particularly scrutinized by scholars analyzing sex segregation resulting from the consequences of Sharia, the moral and religious code of Islam that, in the strictest version, Muslims hold to be the perfect law created by God. Saudi Arabia has been called an epicenter of sex segregation, stemming partially from its conservative Sunni Islamic practices and partially from its monarchy's legal constraints. Sex segregation in Saudi Arabia is not inherent to the country's culture, but was promoted in the 1980s and 1990s by the government, the Sahwa movement, and conservative and religious behavioral enforcers (i.e. police, government officers, etc.). \nIsrael has also been noted both for its military draft of both sexes and its sex-segregated Mehadrin bus lines.\n\nSex segregation is sometimes pursued through policy because it is thought to produce better educational outcomes. In some parts of the world, especially in Europe, where education is available to girls as well as boys, educational establishments were frequently single-gender. Such single-sex schools are still found in many countries, including but not limited to, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nIn the United States in particular, two federal laws give public and private entities permission to segregate based on sex: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. These laws permit sex segregation of contact sports, choruses, sex education, and in areas such as math and reading, within public schools.\n\nStudies have analyzed whether single-sex or co-ed schools produce better educational outcomes. Teachers and school environments tend to be more conducive to girls' learning habits and participation rates improve in single-sex schools. In developing countries, single-sex education provides women and girls an opportunity to increase female education and future labor force participation. Girls in single-sex schools outperform their counterparts in co-educational schools in math, average class scores for girls are higher, girls in single-sex math and science classes are more likely to continue to take math and science classes in higher education, and in case studies, boys and girls have reported that single-sex classes and single-sex teachers create a better environment for learning for both sexes.\n\nCritics of single-sex schools and classes claim that single-sex schooling is inherently unequal and that its physical separation contributes to gender bias on an academic and social basis. Single-sex schooling also limits the socialization between sexes that co-educational schools provide. Coeducational school settings have been shown to foster less anxiety, have happier classrooms, and enable students to participate in a simulated social environment with the tools to maneuver, network, and succeed in the world outside of school. Even in co-ed schools, certain classes, such as sex education, are sometimes segregated on the basis of sex. Parallel education occurs in some schools, when administrators decide to segregate students only in core subjects.\nSegregation by specialization is also evident in higher education and actually increases with economic development of a country. Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Morocco, and Namibia are countries with the least amount of gender segregation in tertiary studies while Croatia, Finland, Japan, and Lithuania have the most.\n\nDesegregation policies often seek to prevent sex discrimination, or alleviate occupational segregation. These policies encourage women and men to participate in environments typically predominated by the opposite sex. Examples include government quotas, gender-specific scholarships, co-ed recreational leagues, or programming designed to change social norms.\n\nIn China, deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee proposed that the public should be more attentive to widespread instances of occupational segregation in China. Often employers reject specifically women applicants or create sex requirements in order to apply. The Labour Contract Law of the People's Republic of China and Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women state that no employer can refuse to employ women based on sex or raise application standards for women specifically, but also do not currently have clear sanctions for those who do segregate based on sex.\nChina has also begun to encourage women in rural villages to take up positions of management in their committees. Specifically, China's Village Committee Organization Law mandates that women should make up one third or more of the members of village committees. The Dunhuang Women's Federation of Dunhuang City, in China's Gansu Province, provided training for their village's women in order to build political knowledge.\n\nIn March 2013 in the European Union, a resolution was passed to invest in training and professional development for women, promote women-run businesses, and include women on company boards. In Israel, the Minister of Religious Services, Yaakov Margi Shas, has recently supported removal of signs at cemeteries segregating women and men for eulogies and funerals, prohibiting women from taking part in the services. The Minister agreed with academic and politician, Yesh Atid MK Aliza Lavie, who questioned him about segregation policies enacted by rabbis and burial officials, that governmental opposition to sex segregation was necessary to combat these practices not supported by Jewish or Israeli law.\n\nIn other cases, sex segregation in one arena can be pursued to enable sex desegregation in another. For example, separation of boys and girls for early math and science education may be part of an effort to increase the representation of women in engineering or women in science.\n\nSometimes, countries will also argue that segregation in other nations violates human rights. For example, the United Nations and Western countries have encouraged kings of Saudi Arabia to end its strict segregation of institutions such as schools, government institutions, hospitals, and other public spaces in order to secure women's rights in Saudi Arabia Even though the removal of certain religious and government heads has made way for liberal agendas to promote desegregation, the public largely still subscribes to the idea of a segregated society, while institutions and the government itself still technically remain under the control of Wahhabism. Reform is small in size, since there is no constitution to back up policy changes concerning sex segregation. The Saudi people refer to this segregation as khalwa and violation of the separation is punishable by law. This separation is tangibly manifested in the recently erected wall in places that employ both men and women, a feat possible by a law passed in 2011 allowing Saudi women to work in lingerie shops in order to lower female unemployment rates. The public views the 1.6 meter wall favorably, saying that it will lead to less instances of harassment by men visiting the expatriate women in the shops. The Luthan hotel in Saudi Arabia was the country's first women's only hotel, acting more as a vacation spot for women than a mandated segregated institution. Upon entering the hotel, women are allowed to remove their headscarves and abayas and the hotel employs only women, calling their bellhops the world's first bellgirls, providing opportunities for Saudi women in IT and engineering jobs where, outside the Luthan, are quite scarce.\n\nFor most children, sex segregation manifests itself early in the socialization process via group socialization theory, where children are expected to behave in certain sex-typed manners and form sex in and out-groups. In pre-school classrooms, for example, making gender more salient to children has been shown to lead to stronger gender stereotypes and intergroup biases between sex groups. These evident tendencies were also manifested in decreased playtime with children of the opposite sex, or a kind of early, selective sex segregation based on preconceived social norms. While specifically segregating by sex for playtime has not been linked to any long-lasting effects on women's rights compared to men, these different manners of socialization often lead to communication and power struggles between men and women and to differential life decisions by each sex based on these long-established gendered identities.\n\nIn elementary and secondary education, sex segregation sometimes yields and perpetuates gender bias in the form of treatment by teachers and peers that perpetuates traditional gender roles and sex bias, underrepresentation of girls in upper level math, science, and computer classes, fewer opportunities for girls to learn and solve problems, girls receiving less attention compared to the boys in their classes, and significantly different performance levels between boys and girls in reading and math classes. Sometimes in elementary schools teachers force the students to sit boy, girl, boy girl. Sex segregation in educational settings can also lead to negative outcomes for boys such as boys in coeducational classrooms having academic scores higher than boys in single-sex classrooms. On the contrary, girls in single-sex classrooms have academic scores higher than girls in co-educational classrooms. Boys academically benefit from a coeducational environment while girls do from a single-sex environment, so critics and proponents of both types of education argue that either single-sex or coeducational classrooms create a comparative disadvantage for either sex. Athletic participation and physical education are examples where appeals to differences in biological sex may encourage segregation within education systems. These differences can impact access to competition, gender identity construction, and external as well as internalized perceptions of capabilities, especially among young girls. Segregation of public toilets by sex is promoted by human rights groups as being critical to ensure the safety of schoolgirls from male abuse. At the same time, sex segregated public toilets may promote a gender binary that excludes transgender people.\n\nA special case presents with choirs and choruses, especially in the tradition of the choir school which uses ensemble and musical discipline to ground academic discipline. Male and female voices are distinctive both solo and in ensemble, and segregated singing has an evolved and established aesthetic. Male voices, unlike female voices, break in early adolescence, and accommodating this break in an educational program is challenging in a coed environment. Coeducation tends to stigmatize males, as is often the case in expressive arts, unlike athletics.\n\nPhysical sex separation is not popular in many institutions on a tertiary level (between types of institutions), while fields of study or majors are highly gendered, such as later life decisions such as work/care work conflicts. Men tend to occupy engineering, manufacturing, science, and construction fields while women dominate education, humanities and arts, social sciences, business, law, and health and welfare fields. However, important life decisions as occupations can yield other instances of sex segregation by impacting occupational sex imbalances and further male and female socialization. Vicki Schultz (1990) indicates that although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits sex discrimination in employment and promised working women change, \"most women continue to work in low paying, low status, and traditionally female jobs.\" Schultz (1990) states that \"employers have argued that women lack interest in male-dominated jobs, which are highly rewarded and nontraditional for women.\" According to Schultz, the courts have accepted this argument, subsequently not holding employers liable. Schultz contends that \"the courts have failed to recognize the role of employers in shaping women's work aspirations.\" (Schultz, 1990:1750,1756)) Schultz states that the judicial framework that has been established by the courts \"has created an unduly narrow definition of sex discrimination and an overly restrictive role for the law in dismantling sex segregation.\" (Schultz, 1990:1757) Schultz concludes by saying, \"courts can acknowledge their own constructive power and use it to help create a work world in which women are empowered to choose the more highly rewarded occupations that Title VII has long promised.\" (Schultz, 1990:1843) Even at psychological levels, socialized preferences for or against sex segregation can also have significant effects. In one study, women in male-dominated work settings were the most satisfied psychologically with their jobs while women in occupational settings with only 15-30% men were less satisfied due to favored treatment of the male minority in such a segregated atmosphere. Stark segregation by occupation can lead to a sexual division of labor, influencing the access and control men and women have over inputs and outputs required for labor. Additionally, occupational sex segregation has certain health and safety hazards for each sex, since employment conditions, type of work, and contract and domestic responsibilities vary for types of employment. In many areas of work, women tend to dominate the production line jobs while men occupy managerial and technical jobs. These types of workplace factors and interactions between work and family have been cited by social stratification research as key causes for social inequality. Family roles are especially influential for predicting significant differences in earnings between married couples. Men benefit financially from family roles such as a husband and a father, while women's incomes are lowered when becoming a wife and mother.\n\nOther gender disparities via sex segregation between men and women include differential asset ownership, house and care work responsibilities, and agency in public and private spheres for each sex. These segregations have persisted because of governmental policy, blocked access for a sex, and/or the existence of sex-based societal gender roles and norms. Perpetuation of gender segregation, especially in economic spheres, creates market and institutional failures. For example, women often occupy jobs with flexible working environments in order to take on care work as well as job responsibilities, but since part-time, flexible hourly jobs pay less and have lower levels of benefits, large numbers of women in these lower income jobs lowers incentives to participate in the same market work as their male counterparts, perpetuating occupational gender lines in societies and within households. Schultz (1990) article indicates that \"working-class women have made it a priority to end job segregation for they want opportunities that enable them to support them and their families.\" (Schultz, 1990:1755) Additionally, economic development in countries is positively correlated with female workers in wage employment occupations and negatively correlated with female workers in unpaid or part-time work, self-employment, or entrepreneurship, job sectors often seen occupied by women in developing countries. Many critics of sex segregation see globalization processes as having the potential to promote systemic equality among the sexes.\n\n\n"}

The murders, which were never solved, aroused a great deal of public interest, and due to similarities between them, they are widely speculated to have been the work of a serial killer or Soviet intelligence.\n\nBetween November 1962 and July 1963, three murders took place in central Israel. The victims were not connected, but each case showed similar parallels. In each murder, the killer, who had no apparent motive, gunned down the victims with an Uzi submachine gun, then immediately fled the scene and was not caught.\n\nThe first victim was Moshe Stolero, a 32 year old disabled man, who owned a household goods, book, and newspaper store in Ramat Gan, and lived with his parents in an apartment in an apartment on Hachayal Street, in the same building where his store was located. On November 15, 1962, at around 7:00 PM, after Stolero had closed and locked up his shop and was returning home, a gunman fired at him with an Uzi as he was in the stairwell of the building. Stolero was hit three times and killed. The fact that the murder was not committed as part of a robbery attempt and nothing was stolen from his store led police to conclude that the murderer's sole intention was to kill Stolero.\n\nThe second victim was Dr. Shmuel Yachman, an internal physician in Tel Aviv who provided medical services to the US Embassy in Israel. Yachman, who was born in Germany as Siegfried Yachman, lived at 12 Mazeh Street. He was murdered on the night of April 2, 1963. Yachman and his wife Sarah were returning home from a concert, when at the entrance to their home, he was killed by a single shot to the neck from an Uzi. The killer immediately fled without leaving a trace.\n\nThe third victim was Deborah Chachkes, who lived with her family in a small house near an orchard on the outskirts of Kfar Saba. In the early morning hours of July 17, 1963, a man entered their home and fired several shots from an Uzi at Deborah and her husband Fishel as they slept. Deborah was killed and Fishel was seriously injured. The murderer again escaped.\n\nThe fact that three mysterious murders had taken place within nine months, all without apparent motive, carried out with the same type of weapon, and in which the murderer managed to escape without leaving a trace, caused panic among the public as the media struggled to find an explanation. Due to the fact that Deborah Chechkes had visited the Soviet Union to see her sick mother two years before, and that Dr. Yachman provided services to the US Embassy, conspiracy theories about the involvement of Soviet intelligence were proposed.\n\nAt around the same time, a 19-year-old medical student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem named Levy Neufeld left his home and disappeared without a trace. Neufeld had survived the Holocaust as a toddler together with his brother Yehuda, and the two brothers had been adopted by a couple from Ramat Gan. Neufeld was an outstanding student, but as his final exams approached, he began to suffer from mental problems prior to his disappearance. After he had been gone for two weeks, his family reported him missing to police. Police then decided that there was a high probability that Neufeld committed the murders. A nationwide manhunt was launched in which over 1,000 police officers were involved. He was presented to the public as a dangerous person, and it was speculated that psychological damage brought on by the trauma of the Holocaust had driven him to kill. The press accused him of the murders, which led to the poetess Zelda sending a letter of protest to \"Haaretz\", accusing the press of baselessly accusing him without trial and comparing the media frenzy to a lynch mob.\n\nOn May 3, 1964, Neufeld was found dead by a group of youths in an abandoned building in the Ein Kerem neighborhood of Jerusalem. A suicide note and bottle of poison were found next to his body. A pathological examination of his body found that the time of his death preceded two of the three murders.\n\nIt was speculated at the time that the murders may have been linked to Soviet involvement due to Chachkes' previous visit to the Soviet Union and Yachman's services to the US Embassy, although no explanation for why the Soviets would have wanted to kill Stolero was offered. In October 2012, Avraham Chachkes, the son of Deborah Chachkes, was interviewed by the Israeli newspaper \"Yediot Ahronoth\", and claimed that his father Fishel had been active in organizing the escape of Soviet Jews who wanted to leave the country, and continued working for Israeli intelligence after his arrival in Israel. He speculated that his mother had been followed after her visit to the Soviet Union, and claimed that his father was the killer's actual target. Avraham claimed to have spoken with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion himself over the matter, and said that Ben-Gurion had told him the killer was a Soviet agent who had since left the country. Isser Harel, the former Director-General of the Mossad, denied the killer was a Soviet spy.\n"}

{"id": "3190563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3190563", "title": "Warsaw Fire Guard", "text": "Warsaw Fire Guard\n\nWarsaw Fire Guard () was a fire fighting unit in the city of Warsaw. Formed as Warsaw's first permanent fire service in 1834, it remained an independent and city-owned venture until its nationalization by the Nazi German authorities during the occupation of Poland following the Invasion of Poland of 1939.\n\nThe Warsaw Fire Brigade was created on December 23, 1834, by the Administrative Council of the Kingdom of Poland. It was to be modeled after a similar fire-fighting unit created in Saint Petersburg only a year earlier. On February 6 of the following year Lt. Colonel Jan Robosz became the first Fire Chief of Fire Guard in Warsaw. The organization of the unit ended on January 1, 1836, and it began its duty. Initially named Fire Guard in Warsaw (Straż Ogniowa w Warszawie), in 1841 it was renamed to Warsaw Fire Guard (Warszawska Straż Ogniowa). The Guard was entitled with all maintenance duties in the city, including putting down fires and fire prevention, but also cleaning the chimneys and the streets. It was divided onto four departments, each of them responsible for a different borough of Warsaw. In 1851 an additional department was created for the borough of Mirów. In 1864 the Guards received the first steam engine-operated mobile pump, manufactured by a London-based \"F. Shand, Mason and Co.\" firm. The following year two additional vehicles arrived, thus making the Warsaw Fire Guard one of the best-equipped fire units in continental Europe. The Guards also assisted in a number of experiments, among them in the tests of a carbonic acid fire extinguisher in 1869.\n\nAlthough the Guards remained largely independent even after the failed January Uprising against Russia, the death of Col. Urban Majewski in 1872 marked the end of much of its independence. His successor as the commander of the Guards, Col. Ivan Anienkov, was a Russian and, in accordance with Russian policy of Russification of Poland, until World War I all commanders of the Guards were also Russians. In 1887 the Guards form a \"Fire Brigade Band\"; with time it became one of the notable parts of the folklore of the firefighting units in Poland. Even most of the fire fighting units have their own orchestras. In 1878, president of Warsaw Sokrat Starynkiewicz ordered a new building for the Guards' headquarters, the first such building constructed in Poland specifically for the needs of the firefighters. Throughout its existence, the Guard usually followed the technical development and introduction of new equipment. In 1906 the guards were equipped with asbestos protective gear, as the first firefighting unit in the Russian Empire. In 1911 the first mobile ladder made by the Magirus company arrived, and in 1914 the Guards leased the first automobile, a van manufactured in the Büssing company.\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I, the Guards continued their service. However, in July 1915 the Russians ordered the evacuation of Warsaw and most of the Guards, along with their equipment. Some of them served in Russian cities, most notably Minsk, Moscow and St. Petersburg. However, many of them escaped from the Russians and return to the Central Powers-occupied city. Among them is Józef Tuliszkowski, who on September 4 was named the commander of the guards. In 1916 the first automobile built exclusively for the firefighters was purchased from the Hans Lloyd company. The same year the citizens of Warsaw sponsored a banner for the Guards, to mark the 80th anniversary of their creation.\n\nAfter the end of World War I, Poland regained her independence and the pre-war commander of I and IV departments, Capt. Józef Hłasko, returned to Warsaw from Moscow (where he served as the commander of that city's firefighters) and became the successor of Tuliszkowski. In 1920, during the Polish-Bolshevik War, the Polish Ministry of Interior decided to nationalize the unit. However, the authorities of Warsaw have sued the state authorities and the decision was withdrawn. Until World War II the Warsaw Fire Guards were the only privately owned fire brigade in Poland and one of the very few such units in the world. Officially their status was similar to that of the Municipal Police. The private ownership (most of the shares were held by the city of Warsaw) allowed for fast modernization of the Guards. In 1928 the last horse-drawn cart was decommissioned; since then the Guard has been fully motorized. In 1936 a new headquarters was built at Polna street, where one of the branches is located even now.\n\nIn 1939, after the outbreak of the Invasion of Poland, by orders of one of the military commanders, the Warsaw Fire Guard was withdrawn from Warsaw to Lublin. However, many firefighters ignored the orders and stayed in Warsaw, where their continued their service during the hard days of the siege of Warsaw, extinguishing fires in dramatic conditions, often during German bombardment. Along with their colleagues evacuated from Łódź, Brzeziny, Ozorków and Nieszawa, they continued their service until the capitulation of Warsaw. Altogether, the Warsaw firefighters lost 30 men and 50 wounded during the fights.\n\nAfter the start of the German occupation of Poland, the Warsaw Fire Guard was officially nationalized by the Nazis. However, the unit remained largely independent and in December 1939 most of the firefighters joined a newly formed Skała resistance organization, with time incorporated into the Armia Krajowa. Most of the firefighters took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, where their experience and commitment proved vital in stiffening the resistance of the besieged city under constant bombardment. On an interesting note, one of the self-propelled pumps of the Warsaw Fire Guard was used as a flamethrower during the heavy fights for the PAST building. The last commander of the Warsaw Fire Guards was Col. Adam Kalinowski. After the war the Allied-backed communist authorities of Poland did not re-create the Guards and instead formed a local branch of the state-owned firefighters unit.\n\nA 10-zloty postage stamp was issued in 1986 to commemorate the Brigade's 150th anniversary. It featured a painting by Józef Brodowski of the brigade's horse-drawn carriages on their way to a fire in 1870.\n\n\n\n"}

The goal of Youth Intervention programs is to encourage and build a young person's connections to the community, \nincluding developing meaningful relationships with caring adults, as a way to support academic achievement, as well as prevent juvenile delinquency.\n\nYouth Intervention providers work with young people to help them become engaged and contributing members of the community. Typically, Youth Intervention programs work with young people between 6 and 18 years of age, but may also work with young people between 18 and 24 years of age.\n\nWhile often viewed as a way to prevent young people from becoming involved in the juvenile justice system or avoid committing a re-offense, Youth Intervention has a broader impact. It is a way to work with young people who are struggling in school and may choose to drop out or are making choices that can lead to teen pregnancy or illegal use of alcohol and other substances, and also works with youth who are homeless and may find themselves in unsafe situations forcing them to make harmful choices.\n\nPoor decision making or engaging in negative behaviors that can lead to interaction with the juvenile justice system can often be a symptom of an underlying problem. Causation factors can include unaddressed mental and emotional health struggles, unhealthy family environments and relationships, as well as stress and adverse childhood experiences (ACES) related to poverty.\n\nWith the wide variety of challenges that can leading to poor decision making, Youth Intervention encompasses a broad array of program approaches. Youth Intervention includes: pre court diversion, restorative justice, mental and chemical health counseling, mentoring, out of school time programs, transitional housing for young people who are homeless, as well as programs that promote employability. The membership of the Youth Intervention Programs Association (YIPA) reflects the diverse approaches used in Youth Intervention.\n\nWith a focus on prevention, measuring the impact of Youth Intervention is challenging. It is difficult to document that a behavior did not occur as a result of the Youth Intervention Program. However, research specific to Youth Intervention programs in Minnesota shows these programs to be effective in reducing truancy and improving school performance. They also result in reduced court costs, a reduced need for social services by the youth and/or family and improved health outcomes. The estimated cost per youth for Youth Intervention is $1,000 to $5,000 per year depending on the type of service. The study also estimated that quality Youth Intervention programs result in $4.80 of benefits per dollar spent on the program.\n\nYouth Intervention produces positive outcomes at a much lower price than incarceration in a juvenile correction facility. Studies show that 70% to 80% of youth who are incarcerated are likely to re-offend. Studies also that for youth committing less serious offenses, incarceration is associated with an increased likelihood of re-offending upon release. And these poor outcomes have a high price. According to the Justice Policy Institute, it costs $407.58 per youth per day to be confined to a juvenile corrections facility. This can amount to as much as $148,767 per youth per year.\n\nUnderpinning Youth Intervention is Positive Youth Development, which centers on providing young people with positive experiences, positive relationships and positive environments. To implement these three factors within a program requires programs to adhere to best practices. This includes having adults who work with young people in these settings to be highly skilled and knowledgeable about youth development. What is clear is that to build resiliency, young people need a web of support that includes parents, teachers and adults in the community. Adults working in Youth Intervention programs are part of that needed web of support.\n\nThe most successful Youth Intervention programs prevent the delinquent or harmful behavior from occurring. But documenting how a program led to a youth not engaging in a behavior is difficult to measure.\n\nBoth the National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine state that prevention and early intervention is typically the most efficient, effective and the benefits are greater than the costs of prevention and early intervention programs.\n\nYouth Intervention has come to be recognized as an important part of reforming the United States juvenile justice system. It produces better outcomes and at a lower cost per youth than incarceration. Of youth confined in juvenile correction institutions, many are confined for nonviolent offenses. Of all juvenile commitments and detentions, 40% are for offenses that are not clear threats to the community's safety. These offenses include low level property offenses, as well as status offenses (activities that are considered a crime only due to the youth's age; examples ae truancy, possession of \nalcohol).\n\nDespite the high costs, incarceration does not produce positive outcomes for youth. Community based Youth Intervention produce much better outcomes for juveniles at low risk to reoffend.\n"}
