It was engaged in the production of polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) for the solar PV industry and the development of large-scale photovoltaic power stations in Ukraine. The company is a member of the European Photovoltaic Industry Association. In February 2016, it filed for insolvency.\n\nActiv Solar produced high-purity polysilicon at its subsidiary \"PJSC Semiconductor Plant\", located in Zaporizhia, Ukraine. The production of semiconductor materials at the original Zaporizhia Titan and Magnesium Plant dates back to 1935. The facility formed the foundation of PJSC Semiconductor Plant, which began production of semiconductor-grade polysilicon in 1964. It was separated from the Zaporizhia Titan and Magnesium Plant in 2002.\n\nThe plant was historically also the only manufacturer of high-purity trichlorosilane in the Soviet Union. After comprehensive refurbishment and modernization, PJSC Semiconductor Plant reached an annual capacity of 2,500 metric tons of polysilicon and 27,000 metric tons of trichlorosilane (HClSi). The facility produces ~20 metric tons per annum of monocrystalline silicon using legacy equipment with a plan to expand to ~400 metric tons per annum. The factory also produces silicon tetrachloride (SiCl), hydrogen, nitrogen and hydrochloric acid.\n\nActiv Solar developed large-scale solar photovoltaic installations. As of November 2012, it had developed six solar PV power stations with 313.35 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity on the Crimean Peninsula and Odessa region. \n\nThe company constructed Ukraine's first large-scale Photovoltaic power plant 7.5 MW Rodnikovoye Solar Park in February 2011. The power plant was built near the town of Rodnikovoye, about away from Simferopol, the capital of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The total number of solar modules installed reached about 33,800 on a total surface area of approximately .\n\nIn October 2011, Activ Solar commissioned one of the world's largest solar power stations, the 80 MW Okhotnykovo Solar Park. Installation consisting of approximately 360,000 ground-mounted PV-modules and spanning over able to generate 100 GWh of electricity per year enough to meet the energy needs of about 20,000 households.\n\nIn December 2011, Activ Solar completed the 105.56 MW Perovo Solar Park, amongst the largest in the world. Built in record-setting time, Perovo's more than 440,000 crystalline solar PV modules can produce as much as 132.5 GWh) of electricity per year, enough to meet the needs of Simferopol. More than 105,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions will be avoided.\n\nIn April 2012, Activ Solar finished work on its fourth large-scale project, 31.55 MW station located in the village of Mityaevo in Crimea. The ground-mounted power station houses over 134,000 polycrystalline modules, installed in double rows and connected by over of cable, and able to generate approximately 40 GWh of electricity per annum enough to supply 8,000 households. \n\nIn July 2012, Activ Solar completed 42.95 MW Starkozache power plant in Odessa Oblast. It is installed over a surface of and consists of 185,952 multi-crystalline solar modules and 41 inverters. The solar plant is able to generate 54.106 GWh of electricity per annum, enough to supply approximately 11,000 households and saves up to 44,000 tons of emissions per year.\n\nIn November 2012, Activ Solar completed the second phase of the 43.14 MW Dunayskaya Solar Power Station in Odessa Oblast. Located in the southern part of Odessa Oblast, it comprises 182,380 multicrystalline photovoltaic modules, 40 inverter stations and around of cable.\n\nIn February 2013, Activ Solar announced the start of commissioning of the 29.3 MW Voznesensk Solar Power Station in Mykolaiv region. Voznesensk Solar Power Station consists of 121,176 multicrystalline solar modules and 27 inverter stations installed on a four-row mounting system. The power station's electricity production capacity totals 35,000 megawatt hours per annum and will save over 28,000 tons of per annum.\nIn April 2013, Activ Solar announced the commissioning of the 43.4 MW Lymanske Solar Power Plant in the south-western part of Odessa Oblast. It comprises 181.192 multicrystalline, installed in one row and connected by over 41 inverter stations. The solar plant will generate 59.415 GWh of electricity per annum and will save up to 46.179 tons of emissions per year.\n\nActiv Solar owned a research and development joint-venture with Diamond Aircraft Industries with an aim to develop products and applications for the photovoltaic industry. Diamond Activ Solar exhibited a solar aircraft wing at the Paris Air Show 2011 Le Bourget.\n\nIn February 2011, Rodnikovoye Solar Park was recognized as one of the winners for the \"Best Project in the Field of Renewable Energy\" by Top-100. Energy Efficiency Award 2011, organized and conducted by the State Agency on Energy Efficiency and Energy Saving of Ukraine (SAEE).\n\nIn December 2011, 82.65 MWp Ohotnikovo Solar Power Station was recognized as the \"Best project in the field of Renewable Energy\" by Green Awards Ukraine, contest where the jury is presented by the leading experts in the field of environmental technologies and practices of the European level, public opinion leaders and representatives of influential international organizations and institutions. \n\nActiv Solar was controlled by Ukraine's former first deputy prime minister Andriy Klyuyev and his brother Serhiy Klyuyev. CEO of Activ Solar, Kaveh Ertefai, is Serhiy Klyuyev's son-in-law. Bogdan Klyuyev, son of Andriy Klyuyev, is a business developer manager of Activ Solar LLC (Ukraine). According to \"Kyiv Post\", Klyuyev's companies are registered at the same building where Activ Solar has its representative office in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the report by \"Ukrayinska Pravda\", Solar Activ was founded by Slav Beteiligung GmbH, owned by Slav AG, investment firm of by brothers Kluyevs. In late 2008, the ownership was transferred to Kaveh Ertefay. In July 2009, ownership was transferred to P&A Corporate Trust. According to a British register, P&A Corporate Trust owns British firm Blythe (Europe) Ltd, which owns 35% of company Tantalit which was the nominal owner of the residence of President Viktor Yanukovych at Mezhyhirya. \n\nAccording to the company register, in 2011 Activ Solar was 100% owned by Liechtenstein-registered P&A Corporate Trust. According to the company, shareholders of the company were European institutional and private investors. According to Johann Harter (COO), all shareholders were Austrian institutional and private investors and there were no Ukrainian private investors or companies associated with the Ukraine among the shareholders. According to Kave Ertefay (CEO), 50% of the shares belonged to investors from Austria and the rest of the EU. Interfax-Ukraina agency reported that controlling stake in Activ Solar belongs to Christian Dries, the owner of Diamond Aircraft Industries, and the rest is owned by the management of the company. At the beginning of 2016, the sole owner of the company was Viennese lawyer Stefan Benesch.\n\nOn 1 April 2014, Activ Solar stopped operations of its solar power plants in Crimea due to unclear legal situation after annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. While Ukrainian authorities stopped paying feed-in tariff for Crimean solar plants, Crimean and Russian authorities also refused to pay it. In spring 2015, Crimean solar plants were seized by Russian banks to cover outstanding loans of Activ Solar. In November 2015, the China National Building Material Company (CNBM) received a clearance to buy the Activ Solar's subsidiary operating ten solar parks located in Mykolaiv and Odessa oblasts. According to the company, it had controlled these power stations since mid-2014 as collateral of its €160 million loan to Activ Solar. CNBM s also interested to buy the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant.\n\nInvestigation had been launched concerning the Ukrainian state credit grant to the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant in 2010. In October 2015, the Ukrainian court ordered repayment of the €57 million grant. As a result, Activ Solar filed for reorganisation in the Commercial Court of Vienna on 10 February 2016. The company explained this move with challenging market conditions in Ukraine due to the economic and political crisis in the region, which affected production in the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant. For that time, Activ Solar's debt had amounted €503.4 million while its assets accounted €18.69 million. The company proposed a two-years restructuring plan with 20% of its debts repayment. Attorney Ute Toifl was appointed as an insolvency administrator. Also the Zaporizhia Semiconductor Plant went into bankrupt.\n"}

{"id": "24643366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24643366", "title": "Albanophobia", "text": "Albanophobia\n\nAnti-Albanian sentiment or Albanophobia is discrimination or prejudice towards Albanians as an ethnic group, described in countries with large Albanian population as immigrants, especially Greece and Italy though in Greece the sentiment has existed mainly in the post-communist Albania era where many criminals escaped to Greece.\n\nA similar term used with the same denotation is \"anti-albanianism\" used in many sources similarly with \"albanophobia\", although its similarities and/or differences are not defined.\n\nIts opposite is Albanophilia.\n\nThe term \"Albanophobia\" was coined by Anna Triandafyllidou on a report analysis called \"Racism and Cultural Diversity in the Mass Media\" published in 2002. Although, the first recorded usage of the term comes from 1982 in \"The South Slav journal, Volume 8\" by Albanian author Arshi Pipa. The report by Triandafyllidou represented Albanian migrants in Greece and was followed by other researchers like Karyotis in Greece and Mai in Italy. The hyphenated form \"Albano-phobia\" is used on some references (including Triandafyllidou), apparently with the same meaning.\n\nAlbanian stereotypes that formed amid the creation of an independent Albanian state, and stereotypes that formed as a result of massive immigrations from Albania and Kosovo during the 1980s and '90s, although they may differ from each other, are still both considered Albanophobic and anti-Albanian by many authors such as Triandafyllidou, Banac, Karyotis.\n\nAlbanophobia signifies a wider range of concepts that could be roughly grouped in two main categories:\n\nThe stereotype by some in Greece of Albanians as criminal and degenerate in Greece has been subject of a 2001 study by the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHFHR) and by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). It is considered that prejudices and mistreatment of Albanians to be still present in Greece. According to a 2002 statement of the IHFUR, the Albanians are the most likely ethnic group in Greece to be killed by Greek law enforcement officials. In addition, the EUMC singles out ethnic Albanians as principal targets of racism. Furthermore, the EUMC found that undocumented Albanian migrants \"experience serious discrimination in employment, particularly with respect to the payment of wages and social security contributions\". Albanians are often pejoratively named and or called by Greeks as \"Turks\", represented in the expression \"Turkalvanoi\". Albanians in Greece are also classified in terms as \"savage\", while the Greeks view themselves as \"civilised\".\n\nPrejudicial representations of Albanians and Albanian criminality (see Albanian mafia) by the Greek media is largely responsible for the social construction of negative stereotypes, in contrast to the commonly held belief that Greek society is neither xenophobic nor racist.\n\nIn March 2010, during an official military parade in Athens, Greek soldiers chanted \"They are Skopians, they are Albanians, we will make new clothes out of their skins\". The Civil Protection Ministry of Greece reacted to this by suspending the coast guard officer who was in charge of the parade unit, and pledged to take tough action against the unit's members.\n\nAlbanophobia in Italy is primarily related to the Albanian immigrants mainly young adults who are stereotypically seen as criminals, drug dealers and rapists. Italian media provide a lot of space and attention to crimes committed by ethnic Albanians, even those just presumed.\n\nEthnic tensions have simmered in the Republic of Macedonia since the end of an armed conflict in 2001, where the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army attacked the security forces of Macedonia with the goal of securing greater rights and autonomy for the ethnic Albanian minority.\n\nThe Macedonian Academy for Science and Art was accused of Albanophobia in 2009 after it published its first encyclopedia in which was claimed that the Albanian endonym, Shqiptar, means \"highlander\" and is primarily used by other Balkan peoples to describe Albanians, if used in South Slavic languages the endonym is considered derogatory by the Albanian community. The encyclopaedia also claimed that the Albanians settled the region in the 16th century. Distribution of the encyclopedia was ceased after a series of public protests.\n\nOn 12 April 2012, five ethnic Macedonian civilians were shot dead allegedly by ethnic Albanian in an attack known as the Železarsko lake killings. On 16 April 2012, in the wake of the attack, an anti-Albanian protest was held in Skopje by ethnic Macedonians in which the participants were recorded chanting “a good Shqiptar is a dead Shqiptar” and “gas chambers for Shqiptars”.\n\nOn 1 March 2013 in Skopje, a mob of ethnic Macedonians protested against the decision to appoint Talat Xhaferi, an ethnic Albanian politician, as Minister of Defence The protest turned violent when the mob started hurling stones and also attacking Albanian bystanders and police officers alike. The police reports 3 injured civilians, five injured police officers and much damage to private property. Although the city hospital reported treating five heavily injured Albanian men, two of which are on Intensive-care unit. During this protest part of the mob burned the Albanian flag.\n\nOn the 108th anniversary of the Congress of Manastir the museum of the Albanian alphabet in Bitola was vandalized, the windows and doors were broken. A poster with the words \"Death to Albanians\" and with the drawing of a lion cutting the heads of the Albanian double-headed eagle was placed on the front doors of the museum. One week after this incident, on the day of the Albanian Declaration of Independence graffiti with the same messages, as those of the previous week, were placed on the directorate of Pelister National Park.\n\nThe origins of anti-Albanian propaganda in Serbia started by the end of 19th century and the reason for this was the claims made by Serbian state on territories that were about to be controlled by Albanians after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. By the late nineteenth century, Albanians were being characterized by Serbian government officials as a “wild tribe” with “cruel instincts”. Others from Serbia's intelligentsia such as the geographer Jovan Cvijić referred to Albanians as being “the most barbarous tribes of Europe”. Whereas politician Vladan Đorđević described Albanians as “modern Troglodytes” and “prehumans, who slept in the trees” with still having “tails” in the nineteenth century. On the eve of the First Balkan War 1912, Serbian media had implemented a strong anti-Albanian campaign.\n\nIn 1937, the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts, and more specifically the noted Serb scholar and political figure Vaso Čubrilović (1897-1990) wrote a memorandum entitled \"The Expulsion of the Albanians\" which dealt with the methods that should be used to expel Albanians including: creating a \"psychosis\" by bribing clergymen to encourage the Albanians to leave the country, enforcing the law to the letter, secretly razing Albanian inhabited villages, ruthless application of all police regulations, ruthless collection of taxes and the payment of all private and public debts, the requisitioning of all public and municipal pasture land, the cancellation of concessions, the withdrawal of permits to exercise an occupation, dismissal from government, the demolition of Albanian cemeteries and many other methods.\n\nDuring the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, on some occasions activities undertaken by Serbian officials in Kosovo have been marked as \"albanophobic\".\n\nThe Serbian media during Milošević's era was known to espouse Serb nationalism while promoting xenophobia toward the other ethnicities in Yugoslavia. Ethnic Albanians were commonly characterized in the media as anti-Yugoslav counter-revolutionaries, rapists, and a threat to the Serb nation. During the Kosovo War, Serbian forces continually discriminating Kosovo Albanians:\n\nA survey in Serbia showed that 40% of the Serbian population would not like Albanians to live in Serbia while 70% would not enter into a marriage with an Albanian individual the same exists in Albania towards Serbs. In recent times, prominent politician Vuk Jeremić in his comments on Twitter about the rights and wrongs of the Kosovo dispute compared Albanians to the “evil Orcs” of the movie \"\".\n\n\n\n"}

The deliberate judicial release of official autopsy photographs after the trial of his killers, for the subsequent distribution of those images on the Internet and for the subsequent debate about the images among government figures, including three successive Children's Commissioners caused controversy that was the result of the tension between the desire for privacy and respect for victims of family violence and the need for publicity to motivate changes in public attitudes to family violence.\n\nNgati had been fostered to a cousin of his birth mother and was being raised in a Tongan language environment until shortly after his third birthday when he was returned to his birth mother, at her request. Maine Annabella Ngati, her partner, Teusila Fa'asisila, and their other children only spoke English. Within three months, Ngati was dead. Photos taken during the autopsy showed bruises from repeated beatings and weeping sores, one of which was \"the size of a man's hand on his bottom.\" Ngati and Fa'asisila were found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter, failing to provide a child with the necessities of life (medical care), and willful ill treatment of a child. In June, 2007, each was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison, with a minimum non-parole period of four years and eight months. Ngati gave birth to another child while in custody – which was placed with either foster or adoptive parents – and she was declined parole in November, 2011. Fa'asisila \"came up for parole [in] December 2011\" and \"will be sent back to Tonga upon his release\", but it is unclear whether he was in fact released.\n\nAfter trial, in an unusual and controversial move, Auckland High Court Judge Graham Lang allowed the release of the autopsy photos into the public realm, and allowed New Zealand's TV One (New Zealand) (TVNZ) to film the autopsy photographs \"so that they may give pause to those people who choose to ignore that their family members are being hurt\". Since then, the images have been distributed through television, email and web, fueling controversy and debate along the way.\n\nTVNZ broadcast the images during a television news programme at 6pm on 6 August 2007. During that segment, Children's Commissioner Cindy Kiro is shown commenting that the public did not need to see these \"graphic images to show them how badly damaged this child was.\" After the broadcast, she lodged a complaint with the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA), arguing that \"[\"One News\"] had displayed a disregard for the rights of the young victim and exploitation of him by showing these photos\". Calling the broadcast a \"further abuse in death\" of the child, Kiro said that it was \"... questionable whether publication of autopsy photographs of a young child beaten to death could ever be in the public interest.\" Her complaint alleged violations of several of the BSA's standards, including \"good taste and decency\", \"privacy\", \"fairness\", \"children's interests\" and \"violence\".\n\nThe complaint was investigated, but was \"not upheld\" on all counts. With respect to \"good taste and decency\" the BSA acknowledged that \"the autopsy images would have been distressing to some viewers. However, they conveyed the grim reality of child abuse in the context of [a news] item...\" They ruled that their privacy and fairness standards did not apply to deceased individuals – they did point out, however, that TVNZ complied with the judge's stipulations against showing the boy's face and genitals, and, \"in this respect, the Authority finds that TVNZ exercised care and discretion in order to preserve the child's dignity.\" \n\nRegarding violence, the Authority quoted from their guidelines, which \"recognises that news programmes will often contain 'violent, disturbing or alarming material', and that broadcasters 'should not falsify by omission, a world in which much violence and brutality occurs'\". That TVNZ provided advance warning to viewers and didn't display the images until two minutes into the story played a role in the BSA's decision-making, especially with respect to children's interests. Although the complaints were not upheld, two of the Authority's members went on record to note that \"it is unusual to see autopsy photographs in the 6pm news, particularly involving children\", and that \"the warning could have made a specific reference to autopsy photographs of a child in order to leave viewers in no doubt as to the content of the report.\"\nThe images were also circulated in an email sent by a protest group calling for tougher jail terms for child abusers, with Kiro calling their use \"abhorrent\". Ngati's name (but not images) were used by Family First to advocate tougher sentences for child abuse and to highlight female family violence perpetrators. Family First's Bob McCroskie supported the shock value of the images. The images have also been used on placards (protest signs).\n\nPreceding Commissioner Roger McClay said, that use of the photos would serve to raise awareness of the child abuse \"epidemic\", which was not well known amongst New Zealanders. He added, \"The more the public of New Zealand is aware of the problem, the more chance something will be done.\" Inspector Richard Middleton, who was involved in the original police case, said, \"The case was very disturbing in view of the amount of violence used against a defenceless three-year-old. Anything that raises awareness and prevents it happening again is great.\"\n\nSome time later the photos appeared on Internet shock sites, which some have characterized as pornographic. In 2011, months after taking office as Children’s Commissioner, Russell Wills said he was \"appalled\" at their use. Even though shock sites did not create the photos, the images nevertheless fueled a squabble \"between\" two such sites in 2011, wherein one lodged an unsuccessful DCMA (copyright) complaint with Google against the other.\n\n"}

{"id": "4028368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4028368", "title": "Benevolent dictatorship", "text": "Benevolent dictatorship\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an authoritarian leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator. A benevolent dictator may allow for some economic liberalization or democratic decision-making to exist, such as through public referenda or elected representatives with limited power, and often makes preparations for a transition to genuine democracy during or after their term. It might be seen as a republican form of enlightened despotism.\n\nThe label has been applied to leaders such as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk of Turkey, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, and France-Albert René of Seychelles.\n\nThe idea of benevolent dictatorship has a long history, dating back to various positively-perceived rulers during ancient times, where authoritarian leadership was the norm. Modern usage of the term in a world society where the norm leans much more toward democracy can be traced back to John Stuart Mill in his classic \"On Liberty\" (1869). Although he argued in favor of democratic rights for individuals, he did make an exception for what he called today's developing countries:\nWe may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. Despotism is [...] legitimate [...] in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement [...]. Liberty [...] has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion.\n\nBenevolent dictator was also a popular rhetoric in the early 20th century as a support for colonial rulings. A British colonial official called Lord Hailey said in 1940s \"A new conception of our relationship...may emerge as part of the movement for the betterment of the backward peoples of the world.\" Hailey conceived economic development as a justification for colonial power.\n\nIn the Spanish language, the pun word \"dictablanda\" is sometimes used for a dictatorship conserving some of the liberties and mechanisms of democracy. The pun is that, in Spanish, \"dictadura\" is \"dictatorship\", \"dura\" is \"hard\" and \"blanda\" is \"soft\". Analogously, the same pun is made in Portuguese as \"ditabranda\" or \"ditamole\". In February 2009, the Brazilian newspaper \"Folha de S.Paulo\" ran an editorial classifying the military dictatorship in Brazil (1964–1985) as a \"ditabranda\", creating controversy.\n\nMancur Olson characterized benevolent dictators as \"not like the wolf that preys on the elk, but more like the rancher who makes sure his cattle are protected and are given water\". This analogy helps explain the seemingly contradictory motivations for benevolence. What seems altruistic on behalf of the dictator is actually acting in rational self interest. The provision of public goods allows for a Pareto improvement in society, from which the dictator can extract taxes to enrich himself or the state.\n\nAlthough Josip Broz Tito led the former republic of Yugoslavia as Prime Minister and President (later President for Life) from 1944 until his death in 1980 under what many criticized as authoritarian rule,\nhe was widely popular and was \"seen by most as a benevolent dictator\". This perception has changed significantly in right-wing circles following the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the examination of various crimes committed by the Yugoslav Partisans in the aftermath of the World War II and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia during its rule, namely the Bleiburg repatriations, the Foibe massacres, Tezno massacre, Macelj massacre, Kočevski Rog massacre, Barbara Pit massacre and the communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45.\n\nDuring his leadership of the Turkish War of Independence from 1919 to 1922 and his presidency from 1923 to 1938, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is credited with removing foreign influence from former Ottoman territory, and is looked fondly upon as the founder of modern Turkey. He presided over a series of reforms such as allowing women to vote, agrarian land reform, removal of Islam as the state religion and the establishment of secularism, and the adoption of a Western-based criminal code.\n\nSince its independence in 1959, Singapore has transformed from a relatively underdeveloped and impoverished agrarian society into one of Asia's wealthiest nations, a center of international banking, business and shipping. Singapore has thus been dubbed as one of the Four Asian Tigers. Lee Kuan Yew and his administration wielded absolute reign over Singaporean politics until 1990, while his People's Action Party has remained in power ever since, controlling Singapore as a dominant-party state. Yew is therefore often called a 'benevolent dictator.' As a leader who was in power for thirty-one years from 1959 until 1990, he implemented some laws that were deemed to be autocratic, and attempted to dismantle political opposition. Despite this, he is reportedly often looked upon favorably by Singaporeans for his transformation of Singapore. Peter Popham of The Independent called Yew \"one of the most successful political pragmatists\".\n\nAlthough France-Albert René seized power in a coup, his one-party rule in Seychelles rapdily developed the country since its independence. His administration established various administrative, public institutions and educational institutions, created a universal health care system, and brought the national literacy rate to 90%.\n\n"}

Christmas is considered as a high holiday by the Russian Orthodox Church, one of the 12 Great Feasts, and of only 4 Feasts preceded by a period of fasting. On Christmas Eve (6 January), there are several long services, including the Royal Hours and Vespers combined with the Divine Liturgy. The family will then return home for the traditional Christmas Eve \"Holy Supper\", which consists of 12 dishes, one to honour each of the Twelve Apostles. Devout families will then return to church for the \"всенощная\" All Night Vigil. Then again, on Christmas Morning, for the \"заутренняя\" Divine Liturgy of the Nativity. Since 1992 Christmas has become a national holiday in Russia, as part of the ten-day holiday at the start of every new year.\n\nIn Russia, the Christmas holiday has become the official celebration with the baptism of Rus' ordered by Prince Vladimir in the late 10th century. However, given the early Christian community Kievan Rus', celebration may have a longer history.\n\nDuring the early-mid Soviet period, religious celebrations were discouraged by the official state policy of atheism until 1936, but despite this, Christmas was marked by the Soviet regime on December 25. Christmas tree and related celebrations were gradually eradicated after the October Revolution. In 1935, in a surprising turn of state politics, many Christmas traditions were re-adopted as part of a new secular New Year celebration. These include the decoration of a tree, or \"ёлка\" (spruce), festive decorations and family gatherings, the visit by gift-giving \"Ded Moroz\" (Дед Мороз \"Grandfather Frost\") and his granddaughter, \"Snegurochka\" (Снегурочка \"The Snowmaiden\").\n\nPrincipal dishes on the Christmas table in old Russia included a variety of pork (roasted pig), stuffed pig's head, roasted meat chunks, jelly (kholodets), and aspic. Christmas dinner also included many other meats: goose with apples, sour cream hare, venison, lamb, whole fish, etc.. The abundance of lumpy fried and baked meats, whole baked chicken, and fish on the festive table was associated with features of the Russian oven, which allowed successful preparation of large portions.\n\nFinely sliced meat and pork was cooked in pots with semi-traditional porridge. Pies were indispensable dishes for Christmas, as well as other holidays, and included both closed and open style pirogi (pirozhki, vatrushkas, coulibiacs, kurnik, boats, saechki, shangi), kalachi, cooked casseroles, and blini. Fillings of every flavor were included (herbal, vegetable, fruit, mushrooms, meat, fish, cheese, mixed).\n\nSweet dishes served on the Russian Christmas table included berries, fruit, candy, cakes, angel wings, biscuits, honey. Beverages included drinking broths (kompot and sweet soups, sbiten), kissel, and, from the beginning of the 18th century, Chinese tea.\n\nIn 1999, atheist MV Agbunov requested that the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation tested the constitutionality of decrees on the recognition of 7 January as a federal holiday. This request was denied by the court based on the argument that \"the specified statutory provisions apply to the law on public holidays days ..., and do not contain provisions indicating the violation of constitutional rights and freedoms referred to by the applicant. (Articles 14, 19, 28 and 29 (part 2) of the Constitution of Russia)\".\n\nIn 2008, a neo-pagan group filed a similar complaint. The group argued that the fact that Orthodox Christmas is an official holiday is contrary to the Constitution of Russia, according to which \"no religion can be established as state and obligatory\". After having considered the complaint, the court rejected it on the grounds that decisions about public holidays are within the competence of the Russian Parliament and are not a constitutional matter.\n\n"}

{"id": "21099870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21099870", "title": "Courtship disorder", "text": "Courtship disorder\n\nCourtship disorder is a theoretical construct in sexology in which a certain set of paraphilias are seen as specific instances of anomalous courtship instincts in men. The specific paraphilias are biastophilia (paraphilic rape), exhibitionism, frotteurism, telephone scatologia, and voyeurism. According to the \"courtship disorder hypothesis\", there is a species-typical courtship process in human males consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result in one of these paraphilic sexual interests. That is, instead of being independent paraphilias, this theory sees these sexual interests as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.\n\nAccording to the \"courtship disorder hypothesis\", there is a species-typical courtship process in humans consisting of four phases. These phases are: \"(1) looking for and appraising potential sexual partners; (2) pretactile interaction with those partners, such as by smiling at and talking to them; (3) tactile interaction with them, such as by embracing or petting; (4) and then sexual intercourse.\"\n\nThe associations between these phases and these paraphilias were first outlined by Kurt Freund, the originator of the theory: A disturbance of the search phase of courtship manifests as voyeurism, a disturbance of the pretactile interaction phase manifests as exhibitionism or telephone scatologia, a disturbance of the tactile interaction phase manifests as toucheurism or frotteurism, and the absence of the courtship behavior phases manifests as paraphilic rape (i.e., biastophilia). According to Freund, these paraphilias \"can be conceptualized as a preference for a pattern of behavior or erotic fantasy in which one of these four phases of sexual interaction is intensified and distorted to such an extent that it appears to be a caricature of the normal, while the remaining phases are either omitted entirely or are retained only in a vestigial way.\"\n\nFreund noted that \"troilism\" (a paraphilia for observing one’s sexual/romantic partner sexually interacting with a third party, usually unbeknownst to the third party) might also be a courtship disorder, troilism being a variant of voyeurism.\n\nAppropriate behaviors depend on the social and cultural context, including time and place. Some behaviors that are unacceptable under most circumstances, such as public nudity or sexual contact between dancers, may be accepted or even encouraged during celebrations like Carnival or Mardi Gras. Where such cultural festivals alter normative courtship behaviors, the signs of courtship disorder may be masked or altered.\n\nParaphilias within the Courtship Disorder spectrum co-occur with each other more frequently than with paraphilias outside the courtship disorder spectrum. The courtship disorder model offers an underlying common cause for these paraphilias in men to explain this co-occurrence.\n\nCourtship disorder is widely cited by sexologists and forensic scientists as one of the predominant models of the paraphilias. Murphy and Page wrote that \"The 'Courtship Disorder Theory' of Freund is one of the only theories specific to exhibitionism.\" According to Lavin (2008), \"Freund's theory, more than the others, makes it clear that the ordering of activities ... has clinical significance.\"\n\nAnother theoretically based taxonomy of the paraphilias was proposed by John Money, who described the range of paraphilic interests as love maps.\n\n"}

In order to receive a licence, each applicant must pass a medical and eye checkup, and a theoretical test, before taking a number of practical lessons culminating in the practical test.\n\nIsrael has the following types of driving licences:\nA2 - 14.6 HP,\nA1 - 47.46 HP,\nA - no limit\n\nC1 for private minibus up to 8 passengers.\nC – for trucks up to 12 tons and no tonnage limit\n\nD3 for a private minibus up to 5 tons, \nD2 for a public minibus with the same tonnage limit, \nD1 for a public transport vehicle with up to 16 passengers, and \nD for buses.\n\n\nAnyone aged at least 16 years and 9 months may receive a Type B driver's licence. After receiving both a medical and eye checkup, an applicant can take a 30 question multiple-choice test, of which they must answer at least 26 correctly. Before taking the actual driving test, they must receive at least 28 lessons at a certified driving school. After passing the internal driving school test, the instructor will arrange the road test, which will be taken in the driving school's vehicle. If someone fails either the written or driving test, one must wait one day before retaking the written test, however the current wait time is to take a second driving test is uncertain, ranging between three to six months. Once the driving test has been passed, the licensing authority will issue a temporary licence together with a payment voucher. Once the fee has been paid, the actual licence will be sent in the mail.\n\nFor the first three months, the new licensee must be accompanied by someone aged over 24, who has had a licence for at least 5 years, or someone over 30, who has had a licence for over 3 years. For the next three months the new driver must be accompanied by someone (with the same specifications as before) in the night, meaning from 9 P.M. until 6 A.M.. after those three months the new driver's accompanied people need to sign on his temporary licence so he could get the permanent one. In addition, during the first two years, the new driver must hang a sign reading \"New Driver\" (, \"Nahag Hadash\") in black letters on a yellow background. Anyone failing to comply with these requirements is subject to be fined and tried in traffic court for driving without a licence. If a new driver violates a traffic law, one may be required to retake the written and driving test.\n\nNew immigrants, tourists, temporary residents, and citizens returning after residing overseas for at least a year may drive in Israel on a foreign licence for one year from entry into Israel.\n\nAnyone possessing a foreign driving licence residing in Israel for more than 12 months must convert their driving licence. As of August 13, 2017, any immigrant that held a driving licence 5 years prior to his/her immigration can convert his/her licence Without taking any tests The applicant is required to undergo both a medical checkup and eye checkup. After applying at the local licence authority office for an exemption from the written test and the requirement for 28 lessons, one is required to pay for a test at the local post office, and the instructor will arrange for an abbreviated driving test. Prior to May 13, 2014 if the applicant failed two such tests, he or she had to pass the written test before retaking a thorough driving test. Legislation passed by the Knesset on that date, however, allows a licensed foreign driver to re-take the test indefinitely within the first three years following aliyah.\n\n"}

He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.\n\nMore broadly, the term used has been used to describe the post-Fordist, postmodern belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.\n\nEpochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and Gemeinschaft. However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western model/Western control.\n\nThe rapid rise of the World Wide Web led many digerati to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience. Evgeny Morozov used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that \"one is living in truly exceptional times – an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism. Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting, had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and A. E. Housman a century before had denounced the mind \"which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually\". \n\nLate modernity however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present, makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.\n\n"}

Although he was educated as an engineer at Cornell University, he passed the Massachusetts state bar examination and became a lawyer in 1881. Parsons was for more than a decade a lecturer at Boston University School of Law and taught at Kansas State Agricultural College from 1897 to 1899. As a leading social commentator of the Progressive Era, Parsons authored a dozen books and more than 125 magazine and journal articles on a wide range of reform topics, including currency reform, regulation of monopolies, municipal ownership, establishment of direct democracy, and other matters. Parsons is also widely regarded as the father of the vocational guidance movement.\n\nFrank Parsons was born on November 14, 1854, in Mount Holly, New Jersey, the son of an Anglo-Saxon family with American antecedents dating back to the time of the American Revolution. The family was highly intellectual in proclivity, with a number of physicians, lawyers, and teachers dotting the family tree, particularly on Frank's mother's side.\n\nIntellectually talented from an early age, Frank was enrolled in Cornell University at the age of 15 and graduated after just three years with a Bachelor's degree in civil engineering.\n\nParsons took a job as a civil engineer for a railroad located in Western Massachusetts upon graduation but he lost this position when the firm collapsed amidst the Panic of 1873.\n\nAfter relatively brief stints as a common laborer and a public school teacher, Parsons decided to go into the legal profession, preparing for the Massachusetts bar examination for one year before taking and passing the exam in 1881.\n\nUnfortunately, Parsons experienced a health failure shortly after passing the bar exam and found himself compelled to move the New Mexico Territory in search of recovery. Parsons would remain in that state for three years. Parsons established a legal practice in New Mexico but soon tired of the profession. Instead, Parsons was employed by the publishing firm of Little, Brown and Company as a writer of law textbooks. Several volumes were produced during the course of this association.\n\nWith textbook publications came academic recognition, and in 1892 Parsons was added to the staff as a lecturer at Boston University School of Law. He would remain in that position for the greater part of the rest of his life, leaving only in 1905 on account of competing research interests.\n\nParson's position at Boston University only occupied part of the academic year, leaving him free to work on other projects and in other capacities for much of the year. He joined the staff of Kansas State Agricultural College in 1897, in the wake of a recent Populist electoral victory in that state and the advent of a new liberal administration at that school.\n\nParsons became interested in the ideas of economic rationalization during the Progressive Era of the 1890s. It was a time of great disparity between wealthy plutocrats, often exercising monopoly power over the economy through organized associations called trusts, and a frequently impoverished working class, racked by periodic depressions such as the 1873 event which had cost Parsons his first job.\n\nWith his characteristic energy, Parsons threw himself into the systematic study of many of the topics espoused by muckraking journalists and intellectuals of the day. A series of books followed, including tomes on monetary reform \"(Rational Money,\" 1898), market dysfunction in the communications industry \"(The Telegraph Monopoly,\" 1899), public ownership of monopoly industries \"(The City for the People,\" 1899), substitution of democracy for oligarchy \"(Direct Legislation,\" 1900), and the abuses of the railroad industry \"(The Trusts, the Railroads, and the People,\" 1906).\n\nIn December 1895, Parsons ran for Mayor of Boston, as the candidate for the Municipal Reform Party—\"a fusion of prohibitionists, labor, populists, and socialists\". He finished third in a field of three, with 0.8% of the vote.\n\nIn addition to his steady stream of books and pamphlets, Parsons wrote extensively for the periodical press, contributing more than 125 articles to B.O. Flower's progressive monthly, \"The Arena\" and other publications. In addition to his prolific work for \"The Arena,\" Parsons was named a contributing editor to the social democratic monthly \"The American Fabian\" in 1896.\n\nIn addition to his writing activities, Parsons also emerged as a prominent public speaker, serving as a lecturer for the National Direct Legislation League, as head of the lecture department of the Social Reform Union, and as President of the National League for Promoting Public Ownership of Monopoly. In the course of his activity, Parsons came to be recognized as a national expert on public ownership of utilities. In 1906, he was commissioned by the National Civic Federation to travel to Great Britain to study the incidence of municipal ownership and its outcomes in that country.\n\nParsons also served as dean of the extension division of Ruskin College in Trenton, Missouri.\n\nFrank Parsons died Sept. 26, 1908, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 53 years old at the time of his death.\n\nA memorial service in Parsons' honor was held October 25, 1908, at the People's Church in Washington, D.C.. In the eulogy by Rev. Alexander Kent, Parson's was remembered as a consistent analyst striving to advance the general weal:\n\"There were few men whose ability was so completely devoted to the public good... The problem of human betterment was always uppermost in his thought. He was continually at work tracing the evils from which men suffer to their source, and showing how they might be avoided or at least greatly lessened. He was a consistent opponent of that individualism which pits men against each other in the struggle for existence, and an earnest advocate of that individuality that fits men for useful membership in the social body, and so draws them together in mutual fellowship and service.\"\n\nParsons' papers are housed at Yale University Library in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nThe posthumous publication in 1911 of Parson's manuscript, \"Choosing a Vocation,\" and its so-called \"talent-matching approach\" proved to be massively influential with a generation of educationalists. Parson's book remains regarded as a classic in the field and Parsons is still in the 21st Century remembered as \"the founder of the vocational guidance movement.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

The mestizo should not be confused with the Yucatec Maya who are also known as \"Maya-Mestizos\" in Belize.\n\nIn 1494 the Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, claiming the entire western New World for Spain, including what is now Belize. Then in the mid-16th century Spanish conquistadors explored this territory, declaring it a Spanish colony incorporated into the Captaincy General of Guatemala on December 27, 1527, when it was founded. In the second half of that century it was integrated into the government of Yucatan in Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1530 the conqueror Francisco de Montejo attacked the Nachankan Maya and Belize but failed to subdue the Maya to Spanish rule, From 1544 we have the first written documents about an established Spanish presence in Belize, in the Mayan city of Lamanai. There a Spanish colonial church was built in 1570. This city reflects considerable European influences. Spanish missionaries arriving in 1550 evangelized the area's population of Ch'ol people (a language group belonging to ethnic group Q'eqchi' people), reaching the Amatique Bay (present Province Verapaz, in the southern half of the current Belize). \n\nHowever, few Spanish settled in the area because of the lack of the gold they'd come seeking and the strong resistance of the Maya people. The Spanish colonists living in Belize often fought against the Maya, who were affected by slavery and disease carried by the Spanish.\n\nIn 1618 there is evidence of evangelization in Pucté, northern Belize, and in 1621 at Tipúes with the Mopanes, in the central part of the territory. After the mid-16th century, there is little evidence of Spanish evangelization. An exception is the journey undertaken by a Dominican priest Father Jose Delgado in 1677. Delgado traveled to Belize from Bacalar, Quintana Roo. He was captured and stripped by some English near Rio de Texoc - probably the present Mullins River. \n\nBetween 1638 and 1695, the Mayans residing in Tipu enjoyed autonomy from Spanish rule. But in 1696, Spanish soldiers used Tipu as a base from which to pacify the area, with the support of missionary activities. In 1697 the Spanish conquered the Itzá, and in 1707 forcibly resettled the inhabitants of Tipu in the area of Lake Petén Itzá. \n\nIn 1717, after the British settlement in Belize between the sixteenth and the seventeenth, the Spanish army led by Marshal Antonio Silva Figueroa and Lazo, governor of the Yucatan Peninsula, expelled the English from the Belize River delta area. But the British returned, prompting a series of Spanish incursions to expel them.\n\nOn 20 January 1783, shortly after the Treaty of Versailles, Britain and Spain signed a peace treaty in which Spain ceded to Britain a small part of Belize, about 1.482 km squarelocated between the Hondo and Belize rivers. British settlers obtained a further concession. By the London Convention of 1786 Spain ceded Belize another 1.883 km square (reaching the Sibun River or Manate Laguna, south of the Belize River).\n\nThen, sometime between 1786 and 1796, a Spanish official visiting Yucatan reported that the English Baymen from Belize Town were expanding to cut logwood also in Campeche, near a town of Spanish population. Spain therefore issued orders for the immediate and effective removal of the settlers who occupied Belize. There ensued a confrontation between Britain and Spain on the coast of Belize in September 1798. This Battle of St. George's Caye ended with the Spanish defeat. The British were able to continue their harvesting of logwood in Belizean territory, even in areas that remained officially Spanish. \n\nAround the 1840s, thousands of Maya people and mestizos were driven from the area of Bacalar during the Caste War (1847-1901), They settled in the Corozal, Orange Walk Town, and Cayo District, as well as in the city of San Pedro in Ambergris Caye. About 7000 Mexican mestizos immigrated during these years. \nIn the 1870s-1880s, the Kekchi emigrated from Verapaz, Guatemala, where their lands had been seized for coffee plantations and many of them enslaved. They settled villages in the Toledo District, living mainly by maize farming and fishing the streams. The Mopan originated in Belize but most were driven to Guatemala after the British assumed control of Belize in the late 18th century, after the Battle of St. George's Caye. They returned to Belize around 1886, fleeing enslavement and taxation in Petén.\n\nAfter 1958, Mennonite groups in Mexico emigrated to Belize, settling in the north and west of Belize (Mexican Mennonites may have intermarried with native-born mestizos and Mexican mestizos). Then between 1980 and 1990 thousands of undocumented migrants moved to the central and western parts of the country. Approximately 40,000 Salvadorans (including Salvadoran Mennonites), Guatemalans, Hondurans and Nicaraguans immigrated to Belize in this decade of strife in neighboring countries. Some 25,000 were from El Salvador and Guatemala. This, along with a high fertility rate, dramatically increased the number of Hispanics in Belize, causing concern over the rapid growth of the Spanish language in a country where the official language is English.\n\nAccording to a 2000 survey, 52.1% of the Belizean population is Hispanic. According to the 2000 census, Belize has 106, 795 Hispanic people. In this figure can be added another 21,848 people who can speak Spanish as second language. In total, there are 128,243 people who speak Spanish in Belize. Although English is the official language, Spanish is spoken by the majority of Belize's population. Also, according to the 2000 census, about 50% of the Belizean population declared themselves Catholics.\n\nThey are mainly concentrated in areas bordering Mexico and Guatemala. That is, Corozal, Orange Walk, and much of the Cayo District, as well as San Pedro town in Ambergris Caye. Both the people of Corozal, as people from Orange Walk, descended from the Yucatans who found refuge in Belizean soil fleeing the Caste War in the 1840s, while people of Cayo, descends from Guatemalans and Salvadorans people, mostly. The remaining districts also have Spanish-speaking population, although to a lesser extent. So, in Belize City, the most populated urban area in the country, it is common to use the Spanish language, next to Belizean Creole and in San Pedro, part of the Belize District, has a predominantly Spanish-speaking population. In addition, the Mopan indigenous live now in the Cayo district and San Antonio (Toledo district). Some of the Kekchi and Mopan have mixed. However, this groups are not strictly Hispanic because they speak their own Maya dialects, but they do come from Hispanic countries. On the other hand, bilingualism in Spanish is encouraged, as the nation is surrounded by Spanish speaking countries.\n\nAccording to the 2000 Population Census, the people from Guatemala make up the largest group (42.9%) of the immigrant population in Belize, followed by nationals of El Salvador and Honduras.\n"}

{"id": "20020658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20020658", "title": "Ideal city", "text": "Ideal city\n\nAn ideal city is the concept of a plan for a city that has been conceived in accordance with a particular rational or moral objective.\n\nThe \"ideal\" nature of such a city may encompass the moral, spiritual and juridical qualities of citizenship as well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street layout, etc. The ground plans of ideal cities are often based on grids (in imitation of Roman town planning) or other geometrical patterns. The ideal city is often an attempt to deploy Utopian ideals at the local level of urban configuration and living space and amenity rather than at the culture- or civilisation-wide level of the classical Utopias such as St Thomas More's Utopia.\n\nSeveral attempts to develop ideal city plans are known from the Renaissance, and appear from the second half of the fifteenth century. The concept dates at least from the period of Plato, whose \"Republic\" is a philosophical exploration of the notion of the 'ideal city'. The nobility of the Renaissance, seeking to imitate the qualities of Classical civilisation, sometimes sought to construct such ideal cities either in reality or notionally through a reformation of manners and culture.\n\nExamples of the ideal cities include Filarete's \"Sforzinda\", a description of which was included in his \"Trattato di Architettura\" (c. 1465). The city of Sforzinda was laid out within an eight-pointed star inscribed within a circular moat. Further examples may have been intended to have been read into the so-called \"Urbino\" and \"Baltimore\" panels (second half of the fifteenth century), which show Classically influenced architecture disposed in logically planned piazzas. The cities of Palmanova and Nicosia, whose were built in the 1590s by the Venetian Republic, are considered to be practical examples of the concept of the ideal city. Other notable example of the concept is Zamość in eastern Poland founded in the late 16th century, modelled by the Italian architect Bernardo Morando.\n\nJames Oglethorpe synthesized Classical and Renaissance concepts of the ideal city with new Enlightenment ideals of scientific planning, harmony in design, and social equality in his plan for the Province of Carolina. The physical design component of the famous Oglethorpe Plan remains preserved in the Savannah Historic District.\n\nLate nineteenth-century examples of the ideal city include the Garden city movement of Sir Ebenezer Howard, realised at Letchworth Garden City and Welwyn Garden City in England. Poundbury, Prince Charles' architectural vision established in Dorset, is among the most recent examples of ideal city planning.\n\n"}
{"id": "697558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=697558", "title": "Irish Canadians", "text": "Irish Canadians\n\nIrish Canadians () are Canadian citizens who have full or partial Irish heritage including descendants who trace their ancestry to immigrants who originated in Ireland. 1.2 million Irish immigrants arrived from 1825 to 1970, and at least half of those in the period from 1831–1850. By 1867, they were the second largest ethnic group (after the French), and comprised 24% of Canada's population. The 1931 national census counted 1,230,000 Canadians of Irish descent, half of whom lived in Ontario. About one-third were Catholic in 1931 and two-thirds Protestant.\n\nThe Irish immigrants were majority Protestant before the famine years of the late 1840s, when far more Catholics than Protestants arrived. Even larger numbers of Catholics headed to the United States; others went to Great Britain and Australia.\n\nThe 2006 census by Statistics Canada, Canada's Official Statistical office, revealed that the Irish were the 4th largest ethnic group, with 4,354,000 Canadians with full or partial Irish descent or 15% of the country's total population. This was a large and significant increase of 531,495 since the 2001 census, which counted 3,823,000 respondents quoting Irish ethnicity. According to the National Household Survey 2011, the population of Irish ancestry has increased since 2006 to 4,544,870.\n\nThe first recorded Irish presence in the area of present-day Canada dates from 1536, when Irish fishermen from Cork traveled to Newfoundland.\n\nAfter the permanent settlement in Newfoundland by Irish in the late 18th and early 19th century, overwhelmingly from Waterford, increased immigration of the Irish elsewhere in Canada began in the decades following the War of 1812 and formed a significant part of The Great Migration of Canada. Between 1825 and 1845, 60% of all immigrants to Canada were Irish; in 1831 alone, some 34,000 arrived in Montreal.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1850, 624,000 Irish arrived; in contextual terms, at the end of this period, the population of the provinces of Canada was 2.4 million. Besides Upper Canada (Ontario), Lower Canada Quebec, the Maritime colonies of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, especially Saint John, were arrival points. Not all remained, many out-migrated to the United States or to Western Canada in the decades that followed. Seldom few ever returned to Ireland.\n\nDuring the Great Famine, Canada received the most destitute Irish Catholics, who left Ireland in grave circumstances. Land estate owners in Ireland would either evict landholder tenants to board on returning empty lumber ships, or in some cases pay their fares. Others left on ships from the overcrowded docks in Liverpool and Cork.\n\nMost of the Irish immigrants who came to Canada and the United States in the nineteenth century and before were Irish speakers, with many knowing no other language on arrival.\n\nThe great majority of Irish Catholics arrived in Grosse Isle, an island in Quebec in the St. Lawrence River, which housed the immigration reception station. Thousands died or arrived sick and were treated in the hospital (equipped for less than one hundred patients) in the summer of 1847; in fact, many ships that reached Grosse-Île had lost the bulk of their passengers and crew, and much more died in quarantine on or near the island. From Grosse-Ile, most survivors were sent to Quebec City and Montreal, where the existing Irish community mushroomed. The orphaned children were adopted into Quebec families and accordingly became Québécois, both linguistically and culturally. At the same time, ships with the starving also docked at Partridge Island, New Brunswick in similarly desperate circumstances. \nA large number of the families that survived continued on to settle in Canada West (now Ontario) and provided a cheap labor pool and colonization of land in a rapidly expanding economy in the decades after their arrival.\nIn comparison with the Irish who went to the United States or Britain, many Irish arrivals in Canada settled in rural areas, in addition to the cities.\n\nThe Catholic Irish and Protestant (Orange) Irish were often in conflict from the 1840s. In Ontario, the Irish fought with the French for control of the Catholic Church, with the Irish successful. In that instance, the Irish sided with the Protestants to oppose the demand for French language Catholic schools.\n\nThomas D'Arcy McGee, an Irish-Montreal journalist, became a Father of Confederation in 1867. An Irish Republican in his early years, he would moderate his view in later years and become a passionate advocate of Confederation. He was instrumental in enshrining educational rights for Catholics as a minority group in the Canadian Constitution. In 1868, he was assassinated in Ottawa. Historians are not sure who the murderer was, or what his motivations were. One theory is that a Fenian, Gaylord O'Neiel Whelan, was the assassin, attacking McGee for his recent anti-Raid statements. Others argue that Whelan was used as a scapegoat.\n\nAfter Confederation, Irish Catholics faced more hostility, especially from Protestant Irish in Ontario, which was under the political sway of the already entrenched anti-Catholic Orange Order. The anthem \"The Maple Leaf Forever,\" written and composed by Scottish immigrant and Orangeman Alexander Muir, reflects the pro-British Ulster loyalism outlook typical of the time with its disdainful view of Irish Republicanism. This only amplified with Fenian Raids of the time. As the Irish became more prosperous and newer groups arrived on Canada's shores, tensions subsided through the remainder the latter part of the 19th century.\n\nIn the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland flooded into Saint John, New Brunswick. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845-1852, huge waves of Famine refugees flooded these shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"Black 47,\" one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour. From 1840 to 1860 sectarian violence was rampant in Saint John resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history.\n\nThe following statistics are not from the 2006 Census of Canada.\n\nThe graph excludes those who have only some Irish ancestry. Historian and journalist Louis-Guy Lemieux claims that about 40% of Quebecers have Irish ancestry on at least one side of their family tree. Shunned by Protestant English-speakers, it was not uncommon for Catholic Irish to settle among and intermarry with the Catholic French-speakers. Considering that many other Canadians throughout Canada likewise have Irish roots, in addition to those who may simply identify as Canadian, the total number of Canadians with some Irish ancestry extrapolated would include a significant proportion of the Canadian population.\n\nIrish established communities in both urban and rural Quebec. Irish immigrants arrived in large numbers in Montreal during the 1840s and were hired as labourers to build the Victoria Bridge, living in a tent city at the foot of the bridge. Here, workers unearthed a mass grave of 6,000 Irish immigrants who had died at nearby Windmill Point in the typhus outbreak of 1847-48. The Irish Commemorative Stone or \"Black Rock,\" as it is commonly known, was erected by bridge workers to commemorate the tragedy.\n\nThe Irish would go on to settle permanently in the close-knit working-class neighbourhoods of Pointe-Saint-Charles, Griffintown and Goose Village, Montreal. With the help of Quebec's Catholic Church, they would establish their own churches, schools, and hospitals. St. Patrick's Basilica was founded in 1847 and served Montreal's English-speaking Catholics for over a century. Loyola College was founded by the Jesuits to serve Montreal's mostly Irish English-speaking Catholic community in 1896. Saint Mary's Hospital was founded in the 1920s and continues to serve Montreal's present-day English-speaking population.\n\nThe St. Patrick's Day Parade in Montreal is one of the oldest in North America, dating back to 1824. It annually attracts crowds of over 600,000 people.\nThe Irish would also settle in large numbers in Quebec City and establish communities in rural Quebec, particularly in Pontiac, Gatineau and Papineau where there was an active timber industry. However, most would move on to larger North American cities.\n\nToday, many Québécois have some Irish ancestry. Examples from political leaders include Brian Mulroney, Laurence Cannon, Daniel Johnson, Claude Ryan, the former Premier Jean Charest, Georges Dor (born Georges-Henri Dore) and former Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. The Irish constitute the second largest ethnic group in the province after French Canadians.\n\nFrom the times of early European settlement in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irish had been coming to Ontario, in small numbers and in the service of New France, as missionaries, soldiers, geographers and fur trappers. After the creation of British North America in 1763, Protestant Irish, both Irish Anglicans and Ulster-Scottish Presbyterians, had been migrating over the decades to Upper Canada, some as United Empire Loyalists or directly from Ulster.\n\nIn the years after the War of 1812, increasing numbers of Irish, a growing proportion of them Catholic, were venturing to Canada to obtain work on projects such as canals, roads, early railroads and in the lumber industry. The labourers were known as ‘navvies’ and built much of the early infrastructure in the province. Settlement schemes offering cheap (or free) land brought over farming families, with many being from Munster (particularly Tipperary and Cork). Peter Robinson organized land settlements of Catholic tenant farmers in the 1820s to areas of rural Eastern Ontario, which helped establish Peterborough as a regional centre.\n\nThe Irish were instrumental in the building of the Rideau Canal and subsequent settlement along its route. Alongside French-Canadians, thousands of Irish laboured in difficult conditions and terrain. Hundreds, if not thousands, died from malaria.\n\nThe Great Irish Hunger 1845–1849, had a large impact on Ontario. At its peak in the summer of 1847, boatloads of sick migrants arrived in desperate circumstances on steamers from Quebec to Bytown (soon to be Ottawa), and to ports of call on Lake Ontario, chief amongst them Kingston and Toronto, in addition to many other smaller communities across southern Ontario. Quarantine facilities were hastily constructed to accommodate them. Nurses, doctors, priests, nuns, compatriots, some politicians and ordinary citizens aided them. Thousands died in Ontario that summer alone, mostly from typhus.\n\nHow permanent a settlement was depended on circumstances. A case in point is Irish immigration to North Hastings County, Canada West, which happened after 1846. Most of the immigrants were attracted to North Hastings by free land grants beginning in 1856. Three Irish settlements were established in North Hastings: Umfraville, Doyle's Corner, and O'Brien Settlement. The Irish were primarily Roman Catholic. Crop failures in 1867 halted the road program near the Irish settlements, and departing settlers afterward outnumbered new arrivals. By 1870, only the successful settlers, most of whom were farmers who raised grazing animals, remained.\n\nIn the 1840s the major challenge for the Catholic Church was keeping the loyalty of the very poor Catholic arrivals during marches. The fear was that Protestants might use their material needs as a wedge for evangelicalization. In response the Church built a network of charitable institutions such as hospitals, schools, boarding homes, and orphanages, to meet the need and keep people inside the faith. The Catholic church was less successful in dealing with tensions between its French and the Irish clergy; eventually the Irish took control.\n\nToronto had similar numbers of both Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics. Riots or conflicts repeatedly broke out from 1858–1878, such as during the annual St.Patrick's Day parade or during various religious processions, which culminated in the Jubilee Riots of 1875. These tensions had increased following the organized but failed Fenian Raids at points along the American border, which arose suspicions by Protestant's of Catholic's sympathies toward the Fenian cause. The Irish population essentially defined the Catholic population in Toronto until 1890, when German and French Catholics were welcomed to the city by the Irish, but the Irish were still 90% of the Catholic population. However, various powerful initiatives such as the foundation of St. Michael's College in 1852 (where Marshall McLuhan held the chair of English until his death in 1980), three hospitals, and the most significant charitable organizations in the city (the Society of St. Vincent de Paul) and House of Providence created by Irish Catholic groups strengthened the Irish identity, transforming the Irish presence in the city into one of influence and power.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1860 sectarian violence was rampant in Saint John, New Brunswick resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history. Orange Order parades ended in rioting with Catholics, many Irish-speaking, fighting against increased marginalization trapped in Irish ghettos at York Point and North End areas such as Portland Point. Nativist Protestants had secured their dominance over the city's political systems at the peak of the famine, which saw the New Brunswick city's demographics completely changed with waves of immigration. In three years alone, 1844 to 1847, 30,000 Irish came to Partridge Island, a quarantine station in the city's harbour.\nAn economic boom and growth in the years after their arrival allowed many Irish men to obtain steady employment on the rapidly expanding railroad network, settlements developed or expanded along or close to the Grand Trunk Railroad corridor often in rural areas, allowing many to farm the relatively cheap, arable land of southern Ontario. Employment opportunities in the cities, in Toronto but elsewhere, occupations included construction, liquor processing (see Distillery District), Great Lakes shipping, and manufacturing. Women generally entered into domestic service. In more remote areas, employment centred around the Ottawa Valley timber trade which eventually extending into Northern Ontario along with railroad building and mining. There was a strong Irish rural presence in Ontario in comparison to their brethren in the northern US, but they were also numerous in the towns and cities. Later generations of these poorer immigrants were among those who rose to prominence in unions, business, judiciary, the arts and politics.\n\nRedclift (2003) concluded that many of the one million migrants, mainly of British and Irish origin, who arrived in Canada in the mid-19th century benefited from the availability of land and absence of social barriers to mobility. This enabled them to think and feel like citizens of the new country in a way denied them back in the old country.\n\nAkenson (1984) argued that the Canadian experience of Irish immigrants is not comparable to the American one. He contended that the numerical dominance of Protestants within the national group and the rural basis of the Irish community negated the formation of urban ghettos and allowed for a relative ease in social mobility. In comparison, the American Irish in the Northeast and Midwest were dominantly Catholic, urban dwelling, and ghettoized. There was however, the existence of Irish-centric ghettos in Toronto (Corktown, Cabbagetown, Trinity Niagara, the Ward) at the fringes of urban development, at least for the first few decades after the famine and in the case of Trefann Court, a holdout against public housing and urban renewal, up to the 1970s. This was also the case in other Canadian cities with significant Irish Catholic populations such as Montreal, Ottawa and Saint John.\n\nLikewise the new labour historians believe that the rise of the Knights of Labor caused the Orange and Catholic Irish in Toronto to resolve their generational hatred and set about to form a common working-class culture. This theory presumes that Irish-Catholic culture was of little value, to be rejected with such ease. Nicolson (1985) argues that neither theory is valid. He says that in the ghettos of Toronto the fusion of an Irish peasant culture with traditional Catholism produced a new, urban, ethno-religious vehicle - Irish Tridentine Catholism. This culture spread from the city to the hinterland and, by means of metropolitan linkage, throughout Ontario. Privatism created a closed Irish society, and, while Irish Catholics cooperated in labour organizations for the sake of their families' future, they never shared in the development of a new working-class culture with their old Orange enemies.\n\nMcGowan argues that between 1890 and 1920, the city's Catholics experienced major social, ideological, and economic changes that allowed them to integrate into Toronto society and shake off their second-class status. The Irish Catholics (in contrast to the French) strongly supported Canada's role in the First World War. They broke out of the ghetto and lived in all of Toronto's neighbourhoods. Starting as unskilled labourers, they used high levels of education to move up and were well represented among the lower middle class. Most dramatically, they intermarried with Protestants at an unprecedented rate.\n\nWith Canadian Confederation in 1867, Catholics were granted a separate school board. Through the late 19th and early 20th century, Irish immigration to Ontario continued but a slower pace, much of it family reunification. Out-migration of Irish in Ontario (along with others) occurred during this period following economic downturns, available new land and mining booms in the US or the Canadian West. The reverse is true of those with Irish descent who migrated to Ontario from the Maritimes and Newfoundland seeking work, mostly since World War II.\n\nIn 1877, a breakthrough in Irish Canadian Protestant-Catholic relations occurred in London, Ontario. This was the founding of the Irish Benevolent Society, a brotherhood of Irishmen and women of both Catholic and Protestant faiths. The society promoted Irish Canadian culture, but it was forbidden for members to speak of Irish politics when meeting. Today, the Society is still operating.\n\nSome writers have assumed that the Irish in 19th-century North America were impoverished. DiMatteo (1992), using evidence from probate records in 1892, shows this is untrue. Irish-born and Canadian-born Irish accumulated wealth in a similar way, and that being Irish was not an economic disadvantage by the 1890s. Immigrants from earlier decades may well have experienced greater economic difficulties, but in general the Irish in Ontario in the 1890s enjoyed levels of wealth commensurate with the rest of the populace.\n\nBy 1901 Ontario Irish Catholics and Scottish Presbyterians were among the most likely to own homes, while Anglicans did only moderately well, despite their traditional association with Canada's elite. French-speaking Catholics in Ontario achieved wealth and status less readily than Protestants and Irish Catholics. Although differences in attainment existed between people of different religious denominations, the difference between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants in urban Canada was relatively insignificant.\n\nCiani (2008) concludes that support of World War I fostered an identity among Irish Catholics as loyal citizens and helped integrate them into the social fabric of the nation. Rev. Michael Fallon, the Catholic bishop of London, sided with the Protestants against the French Catholics. His primary motive was to advance the cause of Irish Catholics in Canada and abroad; he had significant support from the Vatican. He opposed the French Canadian Catholics, especially by opposing bilingual education. French Canadians did not participate in Fallon's efforts to support the war effort and became more marginalized in Ontario politics and society.\n\nToday, the impact of the heavy 19th-century Irish immigration to Ontario is evident as those who report Irish extraction in the province number close to 2 million people or almost half the total Canadians who claim Irish ancestry. In 2004, March 17 was proclaimed \"Irish Heritage Day\" by the Ontario Legislature in recognition of the immense Irish contribution to the development of the Province.\n\nOntario sustains a network of Irish language enthusiasts, many of whom see the language as part of their ethnic heritage. Ontario is also home to Gaeltacht Bhuan Mheiriceá Thuaidh (the Permanent North American Gaeltacht), an area which hosts cultural activities for Irish speakers and learners and has been recognized by the Irish government.\n\nWith the downturn of Ireland's economy in 2010, Irish people are again coming to Canada looking for work. Some come on work and travel visas.\n\nThere are many communities in Ontario that are named after places and last names of Ireland, including Ballinafad, Ballyduff, Ballymote, Cavan, Connaught, Connellys, Dalton, Donnybrook, Dublin, Dundalk, Dunnville, Enniskillen, Erinsville, Galway, Hagarty, Irish Lake, Kearney, Keenansville, Kennedys, Killaloe, Killarney, Limerick, Listowel, Lucan, Maguire, Malone, McGarry, Moffat, Mullifarry, Munster, Navan, New Dublin, O'Connell, Oranmore, Quinn Settlement, Ripley, Shamrock, Tara, South Monaghan, Waterford and Westport.\n\nSaint John has often been called \"Canada's Irish City\". In the years between 1815, when vast industrial changes began to disrupt the old life-styles in Europe, and Canadian Confederation in 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland flooded into Saint John. Those who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845-1852, huge waves of Famine refugees flooded these shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"Black 47,\" one of the worst years of the Famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.\n\nAfter the partitioning of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1784 New Brunswick was originally named New Ireland with the capital to be in Saint John.\n\nBy 1850, the Irish Catholic community constituted Saint John's largest ethnic group. In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 55 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born fathers. However, the city was split with tensions between Irish Catholics and Unionist Protestants. From the 1840s onward, Sectarian riots were rampant in the city with many poor, Irish-speaking immigrants clustered at York Point.\n\nIn 1967, at Reed's Point at the foot of Prince William Street, St. Patrick's Square was created to honour citizens of Irish heritage. The square overlooks Partridge Island, and a replica of the island's Celtic Cross stands in the square. Then in 1997 the park was refurbished by the city with a memorial marked by the city's St. Patrick's Society and Famine 150 which was unveiled by Hon. Mary Robinson, president of Ireland. The St. Patrick's Society of Saint John, founded in 1819, is still active today.\n\nThe Miramichi River valley, received a significant Irish immigration in the years before the potato famine. These settlers tended to be better off and better educated than the later arrivals, who came out of desperation. Though coming after the Scottish and the French Acadians, they made their way in this new land, intermarrying with the Catholic Highland Scots, and to a lesser extent, with the Acadians. Some, like Martin Cranney, held elective office and became the natural leaders of their augmented Irish community after the arrival of the famine immigrants. The early Irish came to the Miramichi because it was easy to get to with lumber ships stopping in Ireland before returning to Chatham and Newcastle, and because it provided economic opportunities, especially in the lumber industry. They were commonly Irish speakers, and in the eighteen thirties and eighteen forties there were many Irish-speaking communities along the New Brunswick and Maine frontier.\n\nLong a timber-exporting colony, New Brunswick became the destination of thousands of Irish immigrants in the form of refugees fleeing the potato famines during the mid-19th century as the timber cargo vessels provided cheap passage when returning empty to the colony. Quarantine hospitals were located on islands at the mouth of the colony's two major ports, Saint John (Partridge Island) and Chatham-Newcastle (Middle Island), where many would ultimately die. Those who survived settled on marginal agricultural lands in the Miramichi River valley and in the Saint John River and Kennebecasis River valleys. The difficulty of farming these regions, however, saw many Irish immigrant families moving to the colony's major cities within a generation or to Portland, Maine or Boston.\n\nSaint John and Chatham, New Brunswick saw large numbers of Irish migrants, changing the nature and character of both municipalities. Today, all of the amalgamated city of Miramichi continues to host a large annual Irish festival. Indeed, Miramichi is one of the most Irish communities in North America, second possibly only to Saint John or Boston.\n\nAs in Newfoundland, the Irish language survived as a community language in New Brunswick into the twentieth century. The 1901 census specifically enquired as to the mother tongue of the respondents, defining it as a language commonly spoken in the home. There were several individuals and a scattering of families in the census who described Irish as their first language and as being spoken at home. In other respects the respondents had less in common, some being Catholic and some Protestant.\n\nFor years, Prince Edward Island had been divided between Irish Catholics and British Protestants (which included Ulster Scots from Northern Ireland). In the latter half of the 20th century, this sectarianism diminished and was ultimately destroyed recently after two events occurred. First, the Catholic and Protestant school boards were merged into one secular institution; second, the practice of electing two MLAs for each provincial riding (one Catholic and one Protestant) was ended.\n\nAccording to professor \"emeritus\", Brendan O'Grady, a history professor at the University of Prince Edward Island for fifty years, before the Great Famine of 1845–1852, in which a million Irish died and another million emigrated, the majority of Irish immigrants had already arrived on Prince Edward Island. One coffin ship landed on the Island in 1847.\n\nThe first waves of Irish immigrants took place between 1763 and 1880. when ten thousand Irish immigrants arrived on the Island. From 1800 to 1850, \"10,000 immigrants from every county in Ireland\" had settled in Prince Edward Island and represented 25% of the Island population by 1850.\n\nThe British divided St John's Island, following 1763, was divided into dozens of lots that were granted to \"influential individuals in Britain\" with conditions for land ownership including the settlement of each lot by 1787 by British Protestants.\n\nFrom 1767 through 1810 English speaking Irish Protestants were brought to the colony as colonial pioneers to establish the British system of government with its institutions and laws. The Irish-born Captain Walter Patterson was the first Governor of St John's Island from 1769 until he was removed from office by Whitehall in 1787. According to the \"Dictionary of Canadian Biography\", what became known as the century-long \"land question\", originated with Patterson's failure as administrator of a colony whose lands were owned by a monopoly of British absentee proprietors who demanded rent from their Island tenants.\n\nIn May 1830 the first ship of families from County Monaghan, in the province of Ulster, Ireland accompanied by Father John MacDonald who had recruited them, arrived on the Island to settle in Fort Augustus, on the lots inherited by Father John MacDonald from his father Captain John MacDonald. From the 1830s through 1848, 3,000 people emigrated from County Monaghan to PEI in what became known as the Monaghan settlements, forming the largest group of Irish to arrive on the Island in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nThe large Irish Catholic element in Newfoundland in the 19th century played a major role in Newfoundland history, and developed a strong local culture of their own. They were in repeated political conflict—sometimes violent—with the Protestant Scots-Irish \"Orange\" element.\n\nIn 1806, The Benevolent Irish Society (BIS) was founded as a philanthropic organization in St. John's, Newfoundland for locals of Irish birth or ancestry, regardless of religious persuasion. The BIS was founded as a charitable, fraternal, middle-class social organization, on the principles of \"benevolence and philanthropy\", and had as its original objective to provide the necessary skills which would enable the poor to better themselves. Today the society is still active in Newfoundland and is the oldest philanthropic organization in North America.\n\nNewfoundland Irish Catholics, mainly from the southeast of Ireland, settled in the cities (mainly St. John's and parts of the surrounding Avalon Peninsula), while British Protestants, mainly from the West Country, settled in small fishing communities. Over time, the Irish Catholics became wealthier than their Protestant neighbours, which gave incentive for Protestant Newfoundlanders to join the Orange Order. In 1903, Sir William Coaker founded the Fisherman's Protective Union in an Orange Hall in Herring Neck. Furthermore, during the term of Commission of Government (1934–1949), the Orange Lodge was one of only a handful of \"democratic\" organizations that existed in the Dominion of Newfoundland. In 1948, a referendum was held in Newfoundland as to its political future; the Irish Catholics mainly supported a return to independence for Newfoundland as it existed before 1934, while the Protestants mainly supported joining the Canadian Confederation. Newfoundland then joined Canada by a 52-48% margin, and with an influx of Protestants into St. John's after the closure of the east coast cod fishery in the 1990s, the main issues have become one of Rural vs. Urban interests rather than anything ethnic or religious.\n\nTo Newfoundland, the Irish gave the still-familiar family names of southeast Ireland: Walsh, Power, Murphy, Ryan, Whelan, Phelan, O'Brien, Kelly, Hanlon, Neville, Bambrick, Halley, Houlihan, Hogan, Dillon, Byrne, Quigley, Burke, and FitzGerald. Irish place names are less common, many of the island's more prominent landmarks having already been named by early French and English explorers. Nevertheless, Newfoundland's Ballyhack, Cappahayden, Kilbride, St. Bride's, Port Kirwan, Waterford Valley, Windgap and Skibereen all point to Irish antecedents.\n\nAlong with traditional names, the Irish brought their native tongue. Newfoundland is the only place outside Europe with its own distinctive name in the Irish language, \"Talamh an Éisc\", \"the land of fish\". Eastern Newfoundland was one of the few places outside Ireland where the Irish language was spoken by a majority of the population as their primary language. Newfoundland Irish was of Munster derivation and was still in use by older people into the first half of the twentieth century. It has influenced Newfoundland English both lexically (in words like 'angishore' and 'sleveen') and grammatically (the 'after' past-tense construction, for instance).\n\nThe family names, the features and colouring, the predominant Catholic religion, the prevalence of Irish music – even the dialect and accent of the people – are so reminiscent of rural Ireland that Irish author Tim Pat Coogan has described Newfoundland as \"the most Irish place in the world outside of Ireland\".\n\nThe United Irish Uprising occurred during April 1800, in St. John's, Newfoundland where up to 400 Irishmen had taken the secret oath of the Society of the United Irishmen. The Colony of Newfoundland rebellion was the only one to occur which the British administration linked directly to the Irish Rebellion of 1798. The uprising in St. John's was significant in that it was the first occasion on which the Irish in Newfoundland deliberately challenged the authority of the state, and because the British feared that it might not be the last. It earned for Newfoundland a reputation as a \"Transatlantic Tipperary\"–a far-flung but semi-Irish colony with the potential for political chaos. Seven Irishman were hung by the crown because of the uprising.\n\nAccording to the 2001 Canadian census, the largest ethnic group in Newfoundland and Labrador is English (39.4%), followed by Irish (39.7%), Scottish (6.0%), French (5.5%), and First Nations (3.2%). While half of all respondents also identified their ethnicity as \"Canadian,\" 38% report their ethnicity as \"Newfoundlander\" in a 2003 Statistics Canada Ethnic Diversity Survey.\n\nAccordingly, the largest single religious denomination by number of adherents according to the 2001 census was the Roman Catholic Church, at 36.9% of the province's population (187,405 members). The major Protestant denominations make up 59.7% of the population, with the largest group being the Anglican Church of Canada at 26.1% of the total population (132,680 members), the United Church of Canada at 17.0% (86,420 members), and the Salvation Army at 7.9% (39,955 members), with other Protestant denominations in much smaller numbers. The Pentecostal Church made up 6.7% of the population with 33,840 members. Non-Christians made up only 2.7% of the total population, with the majority of those respondents indicating \"no religion\" (2.5% of the total population).\n\nAccording to the Statistics Canada 2006 census, 21.5% of Newfoundlanders claim Irish ancestry (other major groups in the province include 43.2% English, 7% Scottish, and 6.1% French). In 2006, Statistics Canada have listed the following ethnic origins in Newfoundland; 216,340 English, 107,390 Irish, 34,920 Scottish, 30,545 French, 23,940 North American Indian etc. \nIt should be noted that most of the Irish migration to Newfoundland was pre-famine (late 18th century and early 19th century), and two centuries of isolation have led many of Irish descent in Newfoundland to consider their ethnic identity as \"Newfoundlander,\" and not \"Irish,\" although they are aware of the cultural links between the two.\n\nAbout one Nova Scotian in four is of Irish descent, and there are good tracing facilities for genealogists and family historians.\n\nMany Nova Scotians who claim Irish ancestry are of Presbyterian Ulster-Scottish descent. William Sommerville (1800–1878) was ordained in the Irish Reformed Presbyterian Church and in 1831 was sent as a missionary to New Brunswick. There, with missionary Alexander Clarke, he formed the Reformed Presbytery of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1832 before becoming minister of the West Cornwallis congregation in Grafton, Nova Scotia, in 1833. Although a strict Covenanter, Sommerville initially ministered to Presbyterians generally over a very extensive district. Presbyterian centres included Colchester County, Nova Scotia.\n\nCatholic Irish settlement in Nova Scotia was traditionally restricted to the urban Halifax area. Halifax, founded in 1749, was estimated to be about 16% Irish Catholic in 1767 and about 9% by the end of the 18th century. Although the harsh laws enacted against them were generally not enforced, Irish Catholics had no legal rights in the early history of the city. Catholic membership in the legislature was nonexistent until near the end of the century. In 1829 Lawrence O'Connor Doyle, of Irish parentage, became the first of his faith to become a lawyer and helped to overcome opposition to the Irish.\n\nThere were also rural Irish village settlements throughout most of Guysborough County, such as the Erinville (meaning Irishville) /Salmon River Lake/Ogden/Bantry district (Bantry being named after Bantry Bay, County Cork, Ireland but abandoned since the 19th century for better farmland in places like Erinville/Salmon River Lake). In this area Irish last names are prevalent and an Irish influence is apparent in the accent, the traditional music of the area, food, religion (Roman Catholic) and lingering traces of the Irish language. In Antigonish County there are other villages of Irish provenance, and still others can be found on Cape Breton Island, in places such as New Waterford, Rocky Bay and Glace Bay.\n\nMurdoch (1998) notes that the popular image of Cape Breton Island as a last bastion of Scottish Highland and specifically Gaelic culture distorts the complex history of the island since the 16th century. The original Micmac inhabitants, Acadian French, Lowland Scots, Irish, Loyalists from New England, and English have all contributed to a history which has included cultural, religious, and political conflict as well as cooperation and synthesis. The Highland Scots became the largest community in the early 19th century, and their heritage has survived in diminished form.\n\nWhile some influential Canadian politicians anticipated that the assisted migrations of Irish settlers would lead to the establishment of a 'New Ireland' on Canada's prairies, or at least raise the profile of the country's potential as a suitable destination for immigrants, neither happened. Sheppard (1990) looks at the efforts in the 1880s of Quaker philanthropist James Hack Tuke as well as those of Thomas Connolly, the Irish emigration agent for the Canadian government. The Irish press continued to warn potential emigrants of the dangers and hardships of life in Canada and encouraged would-be emigrants to settle instead in the United States.\n\nIrish migration to the Prairie Provinces had two distinct components: those who came via eastern Canada or the United States, and those who came directly from Ireland. Many of the Irish-Canadians who came west were fairly well assimilated, in that they spoke English and understood British customs and law, and tended to be regarded as a part of English Canada. However, this picture was complicated by the religious division. Many of the original \"English\" Canadian settlers in the Red River Colony were fervent Irish Loyalist Protestants, and members of the Orange Order. They clashed with Catholic Metis leader Louis Riel's provisional government during the Red River Rebellion, and as a result Thomas Scott was executed, inflaming sectarian tensions in the east. At this time and during the course of the following decades, many of the Catholic Irish were fighting for separate Catholic schools in the west, but sometimes clashed with the Francophone element of the Catholic community during the Manitoba Schools Question. After World War I and the \"de facto\" resolution of the religious schools issue, any eastern Irish-Canadians moving west blended in totally with the majority society. The small group of Irish-born who arrived in the second half of the 20th century tended to be urban professionals, a stark contrast to the agrarian pioneers who had come before.\n\nAbout 10% of the population of Saskatchewan during 1850–1930 were Irish-born or of Irish origin. Cottrell (1999) examines the social, economic, political, religious, and ideological impact of the Irish diaspora on pioneer society and suggests that both individually and collectively, the Irish were a relatively privileged group. The most visible manifestations of intergenerational Irish ethnicity - the Catholic Church and the Orange Order - served as vehicles for recreating Irish culture on the prairies and as forums for ethnic fusion, which integrated people of Irish origin with settlers of other nationalities. The Irish were thus a vital force for cohesion in an ethnically diverse frontier society, but also a source of major tension with elements that did not share their vision of how the province of Saskatchewan should evolve.\n\nTensions between the Irish Protestants and Irish Catholics were widespread in Canada in the 19th century, with many episodes of violence and anger, especially in Atlantic Canada and Ontario.\n\nIn New Brunswick, from 1840 to the 1860s sectarian violence was rampant in Saint John resulting in some of the worst urban riots in Canadian history. The city was shaped by Irish ghettos at York Point, and suppression of poor, Irish-speaking peoples rights lead to decades of turmoil. The division would continue to shape Saint John in years to come.\n\nThe Orange Order, with its two main tenets, anti-Catholicism and loyalty to Britain, flourished in Ontario. Largely coincident with Protestant Irish settlement, its role pervaded the political, social and community as well as religious lives of its followers. Spatially, Orange lodges were founded as Irish Protestant settlement spread north and west from its original focus on the Lake Ontario plain. Although the number of active members, and thus their influence, may have been overestimated, the Orange influence was considerable and comparable to the Catholic influence in Quebec.\n\nIn Montreal in 1853, the Orange Order organized speeches by the fiercely anti-Catholic and anti-Irish former priest Alessandro Gavazzi, resulting in a violent confrontation between the Irish and the Scots. St. Patrick's Day processions in Toronto were often disrupted by tensions, that boiled over to the extent that the parade was cancelled permanently by the mayor in 1878 and not re-instituted until 110 years later in 1988. The Jubilee Riots of 1875 jarred Toronto in a time when sectarian tensions ran at their highest. Irish Catholics in Toronto were an embattled minority among a Protestant population that included a large Irish Protestant contingent strongly committed to the Orange Order.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also co-designed the first locomotive to cover a mile in less than a minute.\n\nBraithwaite was third son of John Braithwaite the elder. He was born at 1 Bath Place, New Road, London, on 19 March 1797, and, after being educated at Mr. Lord's school at Tooting in Surrey, attended in his father's manufactory, where he made himself master of practical engineering, and became a skilled draughtsman. In June 1818 his father died, leaving the business to his sons Francis and John. Francis died in 1823, and John Braithwaite carried on the business alone. He added to the business the making of high-pressure steam-engines. In 1817 he reported before the House of Commons upon the Norwich steamboat explosion, and in 1820 he ventilated the House of Lords by means of air-pumps. In 1822 he made the donkey engine, and in 1823 cast the statue of the Duke of Kent by sculptor Sebastian Gahagan that was erected in Portland Place, London.\n\nHe was introduced to George and Robert Stephenson in 1827, and about the same time became acquainted with Captain John Ericsson, who then had many schemes in view. In 1829 Braithwaite and Ericsson constructed for the Rainhill experiments the locomotive engine, \"The Novelty\". This engine was the first that ever ran a mile within a minute (fifty-six seconds).\n\nAt this time Braithwaite manufactured the first practical steam fire-engine, which was ultimately destroyed by a London mob. It had, however, previously done good service at the burning of the English Opera House in 1830, at the destruction of the Argyle Rooms 1830, and at the conflagration of the Houses of Parliament in 1834. It threw two tons of water per minute, burnt coke, and got up steam in about twenty minutes; but it was looked upon with so much jealousy by the fire brigade of the day that the inventor had to give it up. He, however, soon constructed four others of larger dimensions, two of which, in Berlin and Liverpool respectively, gave great satisfaction. In 1833 he built the caloric engine in conjunction with Captain Ericsson.\n\nIn 1834, Braithwaite stopped playing an active role in the management of the engine works at New Road, and began to practise as a civil engineer for public works. He largely consulted on projects , both at home and abroad, particularly related to the capabilities of, and improvements to, locomotives. 1834 also saw Braithwaite plan and lay out the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) in conjunction with Charles Blacker Vignoles. The railway was formally incorporated in 1836, and Braithwaite was soon after appointed engineer-in-chief of its construction.\n\nAt Braithwaite's recommendation, the ECR's gauge was set at , and the line was constructed as far as Colchester to this gauge. The trackbed, however, being made wide enough for the track to be widened to gauge. On the recommendation of Robert Stephenson the railways was re-gauged to the emerging \"standard gauge\" of ; in later years Braithwaite was an advocate of still narrower gauges. Whilst engineer to the ECR he introduced an American excavating machine and an American steam pile-driving machine. He left the ECR on 28 May 1843. \n\nBraithwaite was joint founder of the \"Railway Times,\" which he started with Joseph Clinton Robertson as editor in 1837, and he continued sole proprietor till 1845. He undertook the preparation of plans for the direct Exeter railway, but the railway mania of the period, and his connection with some commercial speculations, necessitated the winding up of his affairs in 1845.\n\nBraithwaite had, in 1844, a share in a patent for extracting oil from bituminous shale, and works were erected near Weymouth which, but for his difficulties, might have been successful. Some years before, 1836–8, Captain Ericsson and he had fitted up an ordinary canal boat with a screw propeller, which started from London along the canals to Manchester on 28 June 1838, returning by the way of Oxford and the Thames to London, being the first and last steamboat that has navigated the whole distance on those waters. The experiment was abandoned on account of the deficiency of water in the canals and the completion of the railway system, which diverted the paying traffic. In 1844, and again in 1846, he was much on the continent surveying lines of railway in France, and on his return he was employed to survey Langstone Harbour in 1850, and to build the Brentford brewery in 1851. From that year he was principally engaged in chamber practice, and acted as consulting engineer, advising on most of the important mechanical questions of the day for patents and other purposes.\n\nBraithwaite was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1819, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 13 February 1838, and at the time of his death he was one of the oldest members of the Society of Arts, having been elected into that body in the year 1819; he was also a life governor of seventeen charitable institutions.\n\nJohn Braithwaite married Caroline or possibly Caroline Amelia (1803 - 1878) and together they had at least 10 children (6 sons and 4 daughters):\n\nEliza Emma (b. 1824); John (b. 1825); George (b.1826); Clara Ellen Sophia (b. 1828) Frank (b. 1829); Harriet Frances (b. 1831); Richard Charles (b. 1832); Frederick John (b. 1835); Caroline Anne (b. 1836) and Edward Henry (b. 1838).\n\nJohn died suddenly at 8 Clifton Gardens, Paddington, on 25 September 1870, and his remains were interred in Kensal Green cemetery. His wife died in 1878.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1045918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1045918", "title": "Jumping Frenchmen of Maine", "text": "Jumping Frenchmen of Maine\n\nThe Jumping Frenchmen of Maine were a group of 19th-century lumberjacks who exhibited a rare disorder of unknown origin. The syndrome entails an exaggerated startle reflex which may be described as an uncontrollable \"jump\"; individuals with this condition can exhibit sudden movements in all parts of the body. Jumping Frenchmen syndrome shares some symptoms with other startle disorders.\n\nIndividuals with this condition were first found in the Moosehead Lake region of Maine, and were first described by George Miller Beard in 1878.\n\nGeorge Miller Beard recorded individuals who would obey any command given suddenly, even if it meant striking a loved one; the Jumping Frenchmen seemed to react abnormally to sudden stimuli. The more common and less intense symptoms consisted of jumping, yelling, and hitting. These individuals exhibited outrageous bursts, and many described themselves as ticklish and shy. Other cases involved echolalia (repeating vocalizations made by another person) and echopraxia (repeating movements made by another person). Beard noted that the men were \"suggestible\" and that they \"could not help repeating the word or sounds that came from the person that ordered them any more than they could help striking, dropping, throwing, jumping, or starting\".\n\nThe cause of Jumping Frenchmen syndrome is unknown. One theory is that it is a genetic condition. Observation of 50 cases found the disorder to be remotely located and concentrated in the northern regions of Maine. Fourteen of these cases were found in four families. Another set of cases were found in a single family where the father, his two sons, and his two grandchildren exhibited \"jumping\" behavior.\n\nIt may also be a culture-bound syndrome or a formed habit. These French \"jumpers\" lived in a very remote region and most were lumberjacks. This type of small community would allow for a majority to adapt to this sort of reaction. Also, instances of many being shy may imply that the \"jumper\" was positively reinforced by the sudden attention as the entertainment for a group.\n\nIn 1885, Georges Gilles de la Tourette included Jumping Frenchmen syndrome in the typology of \"convulsive tic illness\"; studies of the condition in the 1980s cast doubt on whether the phenomenon was in fact a physical condition similar to Tourette syndrome. Documentation of direct observation of \"Jumping Frenchmen\" has been scarce, and while videotape evidence was recorded by several researchers that showed the condition to be real, MH and JM Saint-Hilaire concluded from studying eight affected people that it was brought on by conditions at their lumber camps and was psychological, not neurological.\n\nJumping Frenchmen of Maine syndrome must be distinguished from other conditions involving the startle reflex or tics.\n\nTourette syndrome is characterized by multiple physical (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. There are many overlaps when compared clinically, but the abnormal \"jumping\" response is always provoked, unlike the involuntary tics in Tourette syndrome.\n\nLatah from Southeast Asia is a disorder where one's startle response is similar to a state of trance with repetitive speech or movements. Miryachit is a disorder found in Siberia that also displays an action similar to \"jumping\". Neurasthenia is a disorder with a startle response during periods of great fatigue.\n\nHyperekplexia is an extremely rare autosomal dominant neurological disease. The symptoms start in infancy with hypertonia, an abnormal muscle tension that decreases flexibility, and an exaggerated startle in all ages of life.\n\nBeard had a unique interest in unusual disorders and took the opportunity to observe the endemic in Maine. He recorded \"startle, jumping, and tic-like behaviors\" among the French Canadians and lumberjacks who lived near Moosehead Lake in northern Maine. He published his descriptions of the Jumping Frenchmen in 1880, and he believed the condition was hereditary. History of Medicine professor Howard I. Kushner calls Beard's description \"the most influential and detailed study\" of these behaviors.\n\nAccording to Kushner, the French physician Jean-Martin Charcot chose his resident, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, to investigate the \"relationship between tic disorders and jumping and startle behaviors reported in Malaysia, Siberia, and Maine\"; Gilles de la Tourette translated Beard's descriptions and published them one year after Beard's papers. In 1885, Tourette published \"Study of a Nervous Affliction\" where he included the startle disorders in the typology of what he called \"convulsive tic illness\", that included what later came to be known as Tourette syndrome. Kushner argues that none of the patients studied by Tourette supported this assertion, and says that \"many of his contemporaries refuted Gilles de la Tourette's typology\".\n\nThe humorist E.C. Bentley wrote a limerick on the subject:\n\nIn the first episode, season 2 of \"Trial and Error\" Anne Flatch has this, among her numerous neuroses.\n\nKushner, HI. \"A cursing brain?: The histories of Tourette syndrome\".

Most of the citizens are found in the rural areas close to Kano and Katsina. They are known to have facial scarification similar to early rulers of Kano and Katsina under the Kutumbawa lineage. In terms of culture, there are only two major differences between Muslim Hausas and the Maguzawa: religion and social organization.\n\nFarming was the leading occupation of Maguzawas, while cattle herding was left to the Fulani. During the dry season, when farming activity is low, the men engage in dyeing, iron working and basketry. The female Maguzawa were known to show an independent streak in economic activity in contrast to an imported harem culture in many other households. Many wives and female slaves engaged in trading and use their profit to buy clothes for themselves and their offsprings. In terms of a socio-political organization, most Maguzawa communities are made up of scattered compounds and like their Hausa counterparts are led by a Sarki. However, predominant Maguzawa communities have three patrilineal cultural leaders. The Sarki'n Noma, who is the head of farming, the Sarki'n Arna, known as the head of the Pagans and the Sarki'n Dawa, the headman of the bush. The latter two heads or Sarkis share equal power. The Sarki'n Arna is usually given to the best beer drinker in the community while the defunct Sarki'n Dawa is the best hunter in the community.\n\nMaguzawa according to the tradition are Hausa speaking people in fact the original Hausa speaking people found in northern Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Chad and some other countries of the world such as Saudi Arabia etc. this is as a result of their economic activity which is trading. Others include hunting, fishing, blacksmithing and farming.\nThere is no distinct difference between Hausawa or Hausa and Maguzawa. The name Maguzawa was named to some group of Hausa people after the jihad of Shehu Usman Fodio of Sokoto who spread Islamic religion in some northern part of the country, these group of Hausa were named Maguzawa by their fellow Hausa because they resisted accepting the Islamic faith from Shehu Usman Fodio and continue with the general Hausa or the known Hausa tradition which includes their way of worshiping the Gods with the help of idols. Maguzawa means \"those that run away from Islam\". All Hausa were known to worship the Gods before the arrival of Islam.\n\nMaguzawa religion revolves around an infinite number of spirits or iskoki (singular - iska) in Hausa. This literally translates into 'WINDS' There are about 3,000 iskoki in the religion. However, the dominance of Islam in the region has diluted the original meaning of the Gods/spirits with the imposed Islamic canon, and they are also referred to today as Al-Jannu (singular Jinn) also known as the westernised 'Genie'. The Isoki are divided into two main categories : The Gona or \"Farm spirits\" who are tame and easier to manipulate, and the Daji or \"Bush Spirits\" who are untamed and much difficult to contact.\n\n"}

Its operations are merged with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China. The National Supervision Commission was formed at the first session of the 13th National People's Congress in 2018. The Commission includes the director, deputy director, and ordinary members and the director is appointed by the National People's Congress.\n\nThe National Supervisory Commission was formed as part of a series of reforms to China's anti-corruption system during the first term of Xi Jinping as General Secretary of the Communist Party. While the Communist Party had institutionalized internal mechanisms for combating corruption in some form since its early days, it was apparent that it was largely ineffective at curbing systemic corruption, and otherwise had no legal basis, as the main organ tasked with combating corruption and malfeasance, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, was a party organ, not a state one.\n\nPrior to Xi's anti-corruption campaign, offenses were often prosecuted at the direction of local party authorities through their control of local Commissions for Discipline Inspection (CDIs) and procuratorial organs. While these authorities theoretically reported to their superior commissions at the next higher level of administration (i.e. the municipal organ would report to the provincial one, the provincial organ would report into the CCDI), in addition to answering to the local party leadership, in reality the local CDIs only answered to local party leaders, as they controlled the budgets, personnel, and resources of these organizations. This often led to arbitrary exercise of power and political selectiveness in the targets of corruption efforts.\n\nIn late 2016, Supervisory Commissions (SCs) began pilot initiatives in Shanxi, Beijing and Zhejiang. Provincial level chiefs of Discipline Inspection began serving concurrently as heads of the local Supervisory Commissions. \n\nThe formation of the National Supervisory Commission centralized control of anti-corruption resources to the central authorities and was aimed at curbing local interference in anti-corruption efforts. The former National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Office Against Dereliction of Duty, and the anti-corruption department of the Procuratorate were all folded into a single agency.\n\nIn February 2018, an amendment to the constitution was proposed to make national and local supervision commissions official state organs. Local commissions will be appointed by local peoples' congresses at county and higher level and will be accountable to them and to the supervision commission at the higher level.\n\n"}

The Pakistani community maintains two schools, the Pakistan School, Bahrain (managed by parents elected board, Patron in chief- Ambassador of Islamic Republic of Pakistan) and Pakistan Urdu School (private school under Asgharali perfume company) which educates community youth.\n\nFor the welfare of the Pakistani community in Bahrain, the Pakistan Club has been established in Manama, which holds numerous events such as Iftar Nights and National Day celebrations.\n\nPakistanis have been in Bahrain since 1920. The first group to arrive to Bahrain were the people who came with the army of Al-Khalifa who were majority Balochs. The British Army also sent its most reliable force from Punjab and India to Bahrain. The presence of Pakistanis in Bahrain dates back to 1950. Bahrain is the first Arab country to grant citizenship to people who had served its country. A Pakistani can be granted citizenship after working for the government for 25 years.

{"id": "31963999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31963999", "title": "Prostopinije", "text": "Prostopinije\n\nProstopinije (meaning Plain Chant in Rusyn) is a type of monodic church chant, closely related to Znamenny Chant. Prostopinije is used in the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, Slovak Greek Catholic Church and among the Carpatho-Russian Orthodox.\n\nThe tradition of Prostopinije chant is used in the lands of Galicia, Volhyn and Ruthenia. The Prostopinije traces its roots to the Slavic traditions of Old Kievan chant and Bulgarian chant, both stemming from the ancient Byzantine chant tradition; however, it was also affected by the local folk Carpathian music. The Prostopinije chant is purely monodic, lacking ison or any other support, as well as folk choral polyphony. Melodically, Prostopinije resembles Znamenny Chant, and is closely related to it historically, but is considerably richer with chromatic movements, reflecting its relative closeness to the Bulgarian branch of the Byzantine tradition.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the first attempt to systematize and write down the body of Prostopinije melodies was undertaken by the cantor John Juhasevich (1741–1814). In 1793, a \"Preparatory School for Cantors and Teachers\" was established in Uzhorod by Bishop Andrew Bachinskyj.\n\nIn the 19th century and earlier, in liturgical practice, the chanting was performed by the trained cantor soloist; however, by the end of the 19th century, through the efforts of Father Andrew Popovich (1809–1898,Velika Kopanya, Ugocha district), the tradition was changed drastically, and the whole congregation present in the church started to participate in the singing. This strong participation of lay people in the church singing was and still remains a relatively unique phenomenon among the similar chanting traditions.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, some efforts to unify the Subcarpathian chanting traditions were also undertaken under supervision of Bishop Julius Firczak of Mukačevo by father John Bokšai (or Bokshai, 1874–1940) and cantor Joseph Malinič, resulting in a publication of first manual for the Carpathian Plain Chant, which was published in Užhorod in 1906.\n\nIn many Orthodox parishes both in Eastern Europe and in the United States, the Prostopinije tradition was replaced by the polyphonic Russian Orthodox Church style of singing. Following the union of some of the Rusin parishes with the Orthodox Church in America, inspired by father Alexis Toth, the Prostopinije was discriminated against, and was in some cases replaced by the Obikhod. A gradual return to this traditional singing is happening now, however, quite similar to processes of re-introduction of ancient chants in other churches and denominations.\n\nUnlike with some other chanting traditions, Prostopinije remained a primarily aural, unwritten tradition for the major part of its history. There were ongoing attempts to notate this chant, however, primarily as a means to systematize and unify it: first in Znamenny chant neumes, then (as of about year 1600) in \"square and diamond\" notation. Neither of these systems became really widespread, however. In the contemporary practice the chant is written in standard Western staff notation.\n\nDue to the predominantly oral nature of the Prostopinije tradition, the majority of melodies do exist in various local variants, sometimes being different even in villages located nearby. Two biggest branches of the tradition may be named, however: those originating from the cathedral towns of Mukačevo and Prešov. Due to the geography of the region, the former of these 2 traditions become the main tradition of the Byzantine Rite Catholic Churches (through the Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh), while the latter is relatively more used in the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese.\n\nThe Prostopinije chant was traditionally performed either in Church Slavonic, or in Hungarian (with the Hungarian-language parishes adhering musically to the tradition of Mukačevo). In the modern practice in the United States this chant is performed in English as well.\n\n"}

Most universities in the UK and Ireland, as well as some in South Africa and the Netherlands have a Rag. In some universities Rags are known as Charities Campaigns, Charity Appeals, Charity Committees, or Karnivals, but they all share many attributes.\n\nIn the UK, the National Student Fundraising Association (NaSFA), set up in December 2011, exists as a support and resource sharing organisation run by those managing rags for others managing RAGs.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" states that the origin of the word \"Rag\" is from \"An act of ragging; esp. an extensive display of noisy disorderly conduct, carried on in defiance of authority or discipline\", and provides a citation from 1864, noting that the word was known in Oxford before this date. Early Rag collectors may have \"ragged\" passers-by until they made a donation.\n\nAlternatively, it is thought to be from the Victorian era when students took time out of their studies to collect rags to clothe the poor.\n\nMuch more recently, backronyms have been invented for \"RAG\" to stand for \"Raise and Give\", \"Raise A Grand\" or \"Raising and Giving\"; these were, purportedly, coined to convince a manager in a large charity of the value of working with student fundraisers.\n\nThe first Rag in South Africa was started at the University of Pretoria in 1925. The students took to the streets in parade that still exists today and is known as the Procession. During this parade, where they build floats, they carry cans and ask the spectating public to make donations. Today RAGs held at Afrikaans universities is called JOOL. The acronym (Jou Onbaatsugtige Opoffering vir Liefdadigheid) is translated from Afrikaans as \"Your selfless sacrifice for charity\". The annual JOOL/RAG week is held at the start of every academic year and serves also as a kind of welcoming party to students of the university.\n\nTraditionally fundraising activities have centred on an annual Rag Week, with events each day for the week. While some Rags are only active for this week, others use \"Rag Week\" as their flagship week to encourage participation for the whole year.\n\nA 'Rag mag' is a small booklet traditionally filled with politically incorrect humour which was originally sold to the local community during Rag Week. Some university Rags with a strong local tradition still sell their Rag Mags, however the majority of others use theirs more as information-tools for new students wanting to know more about Rag.\n\nA number of Rags claim to have published the first ever Rag mags:\n\nSheffield University Rag's Twikker was first produced in 1925. Manchester University published a Rag mag in 1924. An issue of a Rag mag dating from 1923, called \"Goblio\", is in the archives of the University of Southampton. However, Queen's University Belfast holds the most complete set of Rag magazines in its archives, holding 81 different copies of PTQ (\"Pro Tanto Quid\" – taken from the city's motto \"Pro tanto quid retribuamus\") from 1927 onwards.\n\nMany Rags raise the majority of their money for charity through sponsored challenges and fundraising events. While these vary from University to University, typical examples of each include:\n\n\n\nManchester RAG also run one of the longest running sponsored events in the North West, known as The Bogle Stroll, which celebrated its semicentennial anniversary in 2011.\n\nExeter RAG hold the Biggest World AIDS Day event in the UK, called the Safer Sex Ball, Seeing Thousands of students attending to raise money for Charity, £20,000 of which is annually set aside for local AIDS charity the Eddistone Trust.\n\nStreet Collections: Currently known as 'Raids', volunteer collectors go out into the streets (often in costume) to collect for a specific charity on any given day with buckets rather than the clipboards.\nMany Rags also organise week-long 'Tours' over the university holidays in which they will travel from town to town, collecting in each one, and raising thousands of pounds for the beneficiary charity.\n\nMegaraids: A Megaraid is defined as a Raid where more than one Rag is present and in recent years these have been organised on a massive scale by charities with some events taking place consistently for over a decade. Charities which have a developed student fundraising events include Barnardo's, Cancer Research UK, Help the Aged, Hope for Children, Kidscan, Meningitis UK, Meningitis Research Foundation, Meningitis Trust and Worldwide Cancer Research. All Megaraids tend to include a social aspect and often attract former students who still take part.\n\nNaSFA is an association of UK student fundraising organisations. It stands for National Student Fundraising Association and was born out of a meeting of 15 heads of UK RAG organisations at the national Rag conference in Durham 2011. These presidents identified a real potential for dramatic increases in efficiency by sharing knowledge and resources. They lay down some fundamental principles, realised a need for a constant and impartial 3rd party facilitator and duly chose the NUS from a selection of applications to support the project.\n\nThe underlying aims of NaSFA, to foster sharing of resources, knowledge and support for and between student fundraising organisations have contributed to the 30 Rags involved.\nIn December 2011 the original NaSFA founders invited interested parties to an open meeting at the Union of Brunel Students, to ask for approval on what they had been working on and to give Ed Marsh, the Vice-President of the NUS, a mandate to drive NUS support forwards through the organisation's structure.\n\nAn annual conference for RAG societies and Charities is held in the UK. The conference is an opportunity for RAGs, student fundraising organisations, charities and associated partners to come together to network, learn and socialise over three action-packed days. In 2012 the RAG conference was held at Loughborough University, and in 2013, the RAG conference was hosted by The University of Birmingham from the 2 to 5 September. In 2014, the conference was held at the University of York from 26–28 August.\n\n\n"}

Secondary medical services may include psychiatric hospitals, although since deinstitutionalization these have been restricted in favor of wards within general hospitals, and community mental health services based more locally. \n\nSuch services may be provided on an inpatient or, more commonly, outpatient basis. They may offer a range of treatments, usually centered around psychiatric drugs, and be provided by a range of mental health professionals, notably psychiatrists and psychiatric and mental health nurses. Non-medical professionals may also be involved, such as clinical psychologists, social workers and various kinds of therapists or counselors. Usually headed by psychiatrists and therefore based on a medical model, multidisiplinary teams may be involved in assertive community treatment and early intervention, and may be coordinated via a case management system (sometimes referred to as \"service coordination\").\n\nNumerous services exist exclusively for the therapy of mental disorders and distress. They may offer integrative psychotherapy (an eclectic tailored mix of approaches) or a particular approach, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nCommunity services often include supported housing with full or partial supervision, including halfway houses. Social workers and support workers provide support and advocacy.\n\nMany Consumer/survivor/ex-patient organizations provide services for those labeled as having a mental disorder.

Some legal organizations provide specialized services for those diagnosed with mental disorders who may be challenging discrimination or involuntary commitment. Mental health courts are specialized court dockets that exist in some places to provide community treatment and supervision in lieu of incarceration for criminal offenders with mental illness.\n\nA Global Mental Health Group in coordination with the World Health Organization has called for an urgent scaling up of the funding, staffing and coverage of services for mental disorders in all countries, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.\n\nAccording to the Recovery model, services must always support an individual's personal journey of recovery and independence, and a person may or may not need services at any particular time, or at all.\n\nThe UK is moving towards paying mental health providers by the outcome results that their services achieve.\n"}

During the armed conflict, rape was used as a weapon of war.\n\nFemicide in Guatemala is an extremely serious problem. According to a 2012 report by the Small Arms Survey, Guatemala has the third highest rate of femicide in the world, behind only El Salvador and Jamaica. According to official figures, 560 women were murdered in the country in 2012, 631 in 2011 and 695 in 2010, though the exact number is not known.\n\nMurders rarely result in any conviction and often are not properly investigated; less than 4 percent of all homicide cases result in conviction for the perpetrators. Perpetrators are confident they will get away with murder, in part because of the \"machismo\" culture in Latin America. This culture allows women to be treated as objects rather than humans; equality and basic rights granted to men are not even in question for women. Rape culture and victim blaming are the tactics that go along with machismo, and both men and women largely agree with the misogynistic tendencies that have survived for so long.\n\nWomen who work as public activists, such as human rights defenders, including activists working to protect land and natural resources, face violence, threats, reprisal, and illegal arrests. Such acts are often committed by government authorities and security forces.\n\nIn Guatemala, women activists experience at least one attack each day on average, and an estimated eighty-three percent of these activists are land and natural resource defenders. Factors such as foreign investments, typically in mining, have created conflict with native communities fighting to defend their land rights and natural resources. As a result, indigenous women are primary victims of threats and violence. Findings from 2012 to 2014 showed that among female human rights defenders in Central America and Mexico, women defending land from mining operations were the most susceptible to gender violence, including risk of assassination. Guatemala is considered one of the ten most dangerous countries for environmental activists in the world, but accountability for such crimes remains a challenge.\n\nSexual violence is widespread in Guatemala. There are about 10,000 cases of reported rape per year, but the total number is likely much higher because of under-reporting due to social stigma. According to \"Doctors without Borders\", \"Survivors [of sexual violence] are stigmatized and they cannot easily find treatment in Guatemala yet. There are no resources and too little comprehension of patients’ needs by the doctors.\" The nation's health care institutions are ill-equipped and unwilling to provide adequate care for the thousands of women victimized by sexual violence each year. \n\nMany survivors are adolescent girls, leading to Guatemala having the highest teen pregnancy and preteen pregnancy rates in Latin America. Girls as young as 10 years old are impregnated by rape, and they usually carry these pregnancies to birth. Most of these instances of sexual violence are perpetrated by the girl's father or other close male relative (89%). These men do not suffer consequences largely because of the lack of education, poverty, and lack of social respect for women. According to photo activist Linda Forsell, most young girls face expulsion from school if they are visibly pregnant.\n\nSexual violence is often used as a tactic in war, and many women, particularly women from indigenous tribes, often become sex slaves to soldiers and are subjected to rape and other forms of sexual violence. When a community is occupied or destroyed, an entire community of women may be subjected to rape and sexual or domestic slavery, affecting the prosperity and health of the community after a conflict’s end.\n\nIn February 2016, the Sepur Zarco trial convicted two ex-soldiers of crimes against humanity for their sexual abuse of 11 indigenous Q’eqchi’ women, the forced disappearance of the women’s husbands, and the murder of a woman and her two daughters. Expert witnesses called by the prosecution included Brazilian feminist academic Rita Segato. The women of the Q’eqchi” community received substantial reparations for the damage done by the convicted soldiers. This is the first time a case of sexual slavery during armed conflict has been considered in court. In Guatemala, it was the first time any form of sexual violence during a conflict had been settled in court.\n\nCommon health problems that victims of sexual assault in Guatemala often suffer include HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, Hepatitis B, syphilis, Chlamydia, and Gonorrhoea. Because health care is not readily accessible and education about sexual violence not prevalent, avoidable and treatable health problems often go untreated.\n\nThe emotional and psychological impact of sexual violence often requires professional health care to treat, but the stigma surrounding sexual violence makes it difficult for people to discuss.\n\nInternational organizations like Doctors Without Borders try to fill the gap in Guatemala's health care and provide assistance to victims of sexual violence. In 2007, Doctors Without Borders opened a clinic in Guatemala City that provides comprehensive care for such victims. The organization is also implementing educational programs in Guatemala City that aim to end the prevalence of sexual violence there.\n\nThe Center for Gender and Refugee Studies investigates and reports on sexual violence in Guatemala, working with human rights advocates, government groups, and community groups based in Guatemala. They have published papers on the ineffectiveness of Guatemala’s Law Against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against Women, passed in 2008. They also provide resources for attorney representing female victims of sexual violence, and help advocates in Guatemala implement laws that prevent sexual violence. They also educate countries around the world about the prevalence of sexual violence in Guatemala, so that international pressure can be put on the country to prevent sexual violence against women.\n\nThe increased militarization of Guatemala has resulted in abuse and mistreatment of the people of Guatemala. Militarism spreads a perception of brutality and makes it easier to access weapons, which makes the rates of domestic violence against women go up. Guatemala’s military has a hefty history of human rights violations. Murders, torture, and missing people became a daily reality for people in Guatemala. Most findings show that in communities where there is an army present tend to have more violence against women. The Guatemalan military is also correlated with corruption. Recent records state that the government and military are often associated with criminal activity.\n\nMilitarization came to Guatemala in the early 1980s. In Guatemala, as well as in other parts of Latin America, there is an intense \"war on drugs\", that is a conflict between state forces and drug cartels, which has taken a violent turn. As a result of the war on drugs, there is a widespread presence of the military throughout the country thanks to three military bases in known drug trafficking areas. Jody Williams, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, said, \"The war on drugs and increased militarization in Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala is becoming a war on women.\"\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, the budget the military was allotted went from sixty-three million United States dollars to one hundred and seventy-five million dollars. Otto Pérez Molina became the first military official to be elected as president. Shortly after being elected president in 2012, Pérez increased the role of the military in fighting crime. Soldiers now are assigned public safety duties that would normally be reserved for police forces.\n\nAs of 2013 there were twenty-one thousand troops deployed to assist in public safety duties.\n\nAmerindian (indigenous) women in Guatemala face high levels of violence by the military, and state authorities. It is very difficult for indigenous women to obtain justice. Many of them have not received school education, and live in extreme poverty. Girls in indigenous communities do not attend school because of the distance from their homes to school. Indigenous population is estimated at 39.8% of Gatemala's population (in 2012). High illiteracy rates and the fact that they do not speak Spanish makes the justice system limited for them.\n\nDuring the civil war, many indigenous women were forced into sexual slavery by the military. In 2016, a court in Guatemala ordered two former military officers to pay over $1m (£710,000) to 11 indigenous women whom they held as sex slaves during the civil war.\n\nEarly marriage for girls is common in Guatemala; the country has one of the highest rates of child marriage in Latin America. As of 2015, men and women must be at least 18 years of age to marry; sometimes exceptions can be made by judges for girls to be married at 16. Previously, girls could be married at 14 and boys could be married at 16. The age was increased and made the same regardless of gender in hopes to hold both men and women to the same standard. It is estimated that 7% of girls are married before 15 years of age and 30% by 18 years of age. Rates are even higher in rural areas where 53% of females are married before they are 18. Some reasons for early marriage is poverty, rigid gender norms, access to education, and tradition. Older men also provide more financial support to these girls. After marriage, girls are expected to start a family and face a lot of pressure to get pregnant. Teen mothers account for a quarter of births in Guatemala. \"Complications in pregnancy and childbirth are the second highest cause of death for 15- to 19-year-old girls globally\".\n\nGuatemala is ranked the 25th most violent country in the world and Guatemalan police have a reputation for being non-responsive to the high crime rates. The lack of security within the government is what encouraged the start of mobs turning to vigilante justice. Unfortunately, a lot of the crime associated with these mobs is just as bad as the crime they claim they are attempting to prevent. Most of the locals keep quiet for fear of being targeted by these groups themselves, and many of the people participating in the violence are forced to do so.\n\nAs in other countries where the population does not trust the authorities, people in Guatemala often enforce informal 'justice' by subjecting to violence and even murdering individuals whom they believe have violated moral standards. For example, in 2015, a 16-year-old girl was beaten and burned alive by a Guatemalan lynch mob after reportedly being accused of being part of a group that killed a taxi driver.\nAfter years of violence, dictatorship, and conflict, Guatemala's public institutions are ineffective, including its justice system. Lack of funding has made the law-enforcement departments ineffective and, seeing how unlikely it is to be charged, criminals are encouraged to continue normalizing this widespread, unchecked violence. Based on the numbers of incidents actually reported and taken to court, only 3% result in any sort of court resolution. Authorities do not always conduct proper investigations. A minority of the reported crimes against women go to trial, and even fewer result in a conviction. According to Nobel Women's Initiative, in the 1980s, 200,000 people were murdered, and thousands of women were raped. Many cases similar to these have not gone to trial. Of the complaints about violence against women that were registered in 2010 by the Judicial Department, only one percent of them resulted in sentencing.\n\nLaw enforcement often fails to investigate in a timely manner and blame the victims of the case. Many women abandon their cases because the stress and hardship put onto them. Without proper trials, investigations, and sentencing, the violence towards women will progressively increase.\n\nWomen are often murdered or subjected to violence by family members such as fathers, brothers, stepfathers and husbands, but when they try to report a crime that was done by family members, the women themselves are often treated as criminals for complaining. Discrimination in the justice system is one of the many problems women face in Guatemala. The justice system discriminates against others' race, class, sex, and ethnicity. Discrimination is worst for women who are poor, migrant, young, lesbian, and those that demand justice.\n\nThere is a lack of female representation in the political system. As of 2015, only 13.9% of members of Parliament were women.\n\nThe justice system is limited for people who do not speak Spanish. This means that the women must be educated in order to protect their rights. The 2008 law against femicide and other forms of violence against women has enforced people to treat women equally. The 2008 law addressed the private and public crimes in Guatemala. Women in Guatemala are often uninformed of their rights and do not have the courage to report the crimes committed against them.\n\nGuatemala is a country that has one of the most prevalent rates of violence against women in the world. Instances of gendered violence in Guatemala include domestic violence, sexual violence, human trafficking, incest, and femicide (the deliberate killing of women). In response to violence against women, the government has passed laws and created agencies in order to stunt the high rates of gendered violence in Guatemala in the 1990s: in 1996 it enacted \"Ley para prevenir, sancionar y erradicar la violencia intrafamiliar\" (Law on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Domestic Violence). In 2008, it enacted \"Ley contra el Femicidio y otras Formas de Violencia Contra la Mujer \" (Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence Against Women), and in 2009 it enacted \"Ley contra la violencia sexual, explotación y trata de personas\" (Law against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons).\n\nIn 2008, the (Human Rights Ombudsman) was created, which is an agency that operates with the intention of enforcing citizens' cooperation with human rights laws. Despite these efforts made by Guatemala's government, the number of women who experience gendered violence persists. The ineffectiveness of Procurador de los Derechos Humanos is a result of a multitude of factors including the weakness of the justice system, a lack of clarity surrounding laws made regarding gendered violence, and the absence of free institutions that would aid victims. Despite the intentions of enacting Procurador de los Derechos Humanos, the full potential of its efficiency has not yet been reached.\n\nMore recently, social groups advocating for gender equality in Guatemala helped reform the age at which a girl is able to legally be married. The Angélica Fuentes Foundation and Girl Up (a United Nations youth foundation) together put forth an initiative to change the legal age of marriage in Guatemala from 14 to 18. These advocates had integral roles in the passing of the legislation in January 2016. The leaders of both The Angélica Fuentes Foundation and Girl Up stated that their main goal of pushing for a higher marriage age was to aid the children in Guatemala. Young girls often would be forced to give up their education and be constricted to a life devoted to marriage, however with the marriage age raised young women would be free to pursue other interests. The leader of The Angélica Fuentes Foundation states that it is her hope that this initiative promotes gender equality and an increase in opportunity for young girls in Guatemala, as well as in other Latin American countries.\n\n"}

Norton\n\nWilliam Wallace \"Bill\" Norton, Jr. (September 24, 1925 – October 1, 2010) was an American screenwriter particularly notable for his collaborations with Burt Reynolds Later in life, he was convicted of gun running in France when he tried to send arms from the United States to the Irish National Liberation Army in Northern Ireland. After being released from prison, he moved to Nicaragua, where he shot and killed an intruder in his Managua home. He later spent a year living in Cuba but became disillusioned with Communism and was reportedly smuggled from Mexico into the U.S. by his ex-wife.\n\nNorton was born to Andrena \"Rena\" (\"née\" Callahan; March 20, 1902 – October 16, 1989) and William Wallace Norton (February 14, 1900 – July 18, 1973) in Ogden, Utah, where his parents owned a ranch which they lost at the start of the Great Depression. His family moved to Berkeley, California, and then later to El Monte. He attended El Monte High School, where he was class president.\n\nDuring World War II, Norton enlisted in the United States Army and served in Europe as an infantry officer with 5th Infantry, 71st Infantry Division with Patton's Third Army. He started writing, using his life experience of growing up poor and serving in the military, and some of his plays were produced by local theater companies. He joined the Communist Party in his youth and in 1958 was called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, though he did not name anyone.\n\nHe wrote for the television series \"The Big Valley\", which was broadcast from 1965 to 1968. His big screen breakthrough came with his script for the 1968 film \"The Scalphunters\", set in the antebellum West, with the movie starring Burt Lancaster, Ossie Davis and Shelley Winters.\n\nOther screenplays that Norton wrote included the Angie Dickinson vehicle \"Big Bad Mama\", produced by Roger Corman, and the John Wayne detective film \"Brannigan\" (1975). He wrote the Burt Reynolds vehicles \"Sam Whiskey\", \"The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing\", \"White Lightning\" and \"Gator\". When asked by a nurse the day before he died if she would know any of Norton's films, he replied \"I don't think your I.Q. is low enough\".\n\nAfter moving to Ireland in the mid-1980s, Norton was angered by attacks staged against Roman Catholic residents of Northern Ireland. He flew back to the U.S. and purchased a number of guns to bring back to supply the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). Norton also purchased a camping van and had a hidden compartment made. The van was shipped aboard a Panamanian ship inside a container, from Los Angeles to the port at Rotterdam. The van, still inside the container, was then put on a truck and hauled from Rotterdam, through Belgium, to the port of Le Havre, France. Authorities were watching the van, which had two submachine guns, 12 rifles, 23 revolvers and 2,200 rounds of ammunition in the hidden compartment. Norton and his wife, Eleanor, were arrested on June 11, 1986, trying to retrieve the vehicle and were both convicted. Also arrested with them were two INLA members, James MacLaughin and Sean Hughes, and also Hughes' girlfriend Susan May. Susan May's two children, who were with her, were taken to a children's home.\n\nIn August 1987, William Norton, Hughes and MacLaughin were each sentenced to four years in prison, while Eleanor Norton was sentenced to three years with two of those suspended. Additionally, the group was forbidden to return to France for five years, and they were fined a total of US$81,700. Susan May was not convicted.\n\nNorton was released after 19 months while his wife served five months before her release on medical grounds. The couple were subject to a U.S. warrant on the gun smuggling charges and were granted asylum in Nicaragua.\n\nAfter bandits broke into his house in Managua, he was able to find a gun and shot and killed one of the robbers.\n\nHe relocated to Cuba in the 1990s, but rapidly became disenchanted with life under Communism. He moved, this time to Mexico, and sought the help of his daughter and his first wife to bring him back into the United States. He met his family members in Tijuana, and they smuggled him back across the U.S. border. He settled in Santa Barbara, California, where he reportedly spent years worrying that the FBI would arrest him until a lawyer convinced him that he had nothing to worry about. He wrote a script, \"Exiled in America\", based on his experiences, which was produced by Paul Leder.\n\nNorton died in Santa Barbara of a heart attack, aged 85, on October 1, 2010. He was survived by his second wife, Eleanor, as well as by two daughters and a son, writer-director Bill L. Norton. His first marriage, to the former Betty Conklin, had ended in divorce.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23085069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23085069", "title": "Women's rights in Haiti", "text": "Women's rights in Haiti\n\nWomen in Haiti have equal constitutional rights as men in the economic, political, cultural and social fields, as well as in the family.\n\nHowever, the reality in Haiti is quite far from the law: \"political, economic and social features of Haiti negatively affect most Haitians, but Haitian women experience additional barriers to the full enjoyment of their basic rights due to predominant social beliefs that they are inferior to men and a historical pattern of discrimination and violence against them based on their sex. Discrimination against women is a structural feature in Haitian society and culture that has subsisted throughout its history, both in times of peace and unrest.\"\n\nSome Haitian scholars argue that Haitian peasant women are often less restricted socially than women in Western societies or even in comparison to more westernized elite Haitian women. They attribute this fact to the influence of African matriarcal systems and of the Haitian Vodou religion which places women at the center of society contrary to purely Judeo-Christian systems. Women priests (named mambos) play equal roles to male priests or Houngan in Haitian vodou.\n\nThe sexual equality inherent to Haitian vodou translates into the inclusion of women in all aspects of society. Peasant women specifically, because of their proximity to vodou, have traditionally played a crucial role in Haitian life. Compared to their Latin-American counterparts, the participation of Haitian women in agriculture, commerce and industry has been high. During the US occupation of Haiti (1915-1934) peasant women actively participated in guerilla warfare and anti-US intelligence gathering to free the country. Because of their involvement in commerce, Haitian peasant women have accumulated resources independent of their mates in contrast to more westernized elite Haitian women.\n\nThe Haitian government contains a Ministry of Women's Affairs, but it also lacks the resources to address issues such as violence against women and harassment in the workplace. A number of political figures such as Michele Pierre-Louis, Haiti's second female Prime Minister, have adopted a determined agenda in order to fight inequalities and persecutions against women. Her position in office as Prime Minister has had positive effect on female political leadership in a country where the percentage of women in government at ministerial level was 25% in 2005.\n\nA women's movement emerged in Haiti in the 1930s during an economic crisis which is thought to have forced some middle-class Haitian women to work outside the home for the first time unlike peasant women who had always done so. This was also a time at which more elite women began to pursue post-secondary education and when L'Université D'Etat d'Haiti opened its doors to women. The first Haitian woman to receive a secondary education graduated during this period in 1933.\n\nOne of the first established feminist organizations in Haiti was called the Ligue Féminine d'Action Sociale (Feminine League for Social Action) and was created in 1934. Its mostly elite initial members included: Madeleine Sylvain, Alice Garoute, Fernande Bellegarde, Thérèse Hudicourt, Alice Mathon, Marie-Thérèse Colimon, Marie-Thérèse Poitevien. The Ligue was banned by the government two months after its founding. The league was reestablished when it agreed to study its goals instead of immediately implementing them. The league is credited for the granting of voting rights for women in 1957.\n\nIn 1950, writer and feminist Paulette Poujol-Oriol joined the league. She later served as President of the League from 1997 until her death on March 11, 2011. She was also a founding member of L'Alliance des Femmes Haitiennes, an umbrella organization for more than 50 women's groups.\n\nSome women were appointed to government leadership positions under François Duvalier: Rosalie Adolphe (aka Madame Max Adolphe) was appointed head of the secret police (Volontaires de La Sécurité Nationale or VSN) while Lydia O. Jeanty was named Under-Secretary of Labor in 1957 and Lucienne Heurtelou, the widow of former President Dumarsais Estimé, was Haiti's first female ambassador. Marie-Denise Duvalier nearly succeeded her father in 1971.\n\nWomen in Haiti may suffer threats to their security and well-being because of rape, kid-napping and human trafficking. Women suffer the most from Haiti's chronic political instability.\n\nDocumented cases of politically motivated rape, massacres, forced disappearance, and violent assaults on entire neighborhoods increased greatly at the end of 1993 under the military dictatorship of Raoul Cédras. Reports from women's rights groups in Haiti revealed that women were targeted for abuse in ways and for reasons that men were not. Uniformed military personnel and their civilian allies threatened and attacked women's organizations for their work in defense of women's rights and subjected women to sex-specific abuse ranging from bludgeoning women's breasts to rape.\n\nThe troubles before the 2004 coup were seen by most of the nationwide women's group as a reminder of the 1991–94 coup d'etat tactics with the use of rape, kidnapping and murders as forms of intimidation. If most of the feminist activists in Haiti campaigned for the election of Jean-Bertrand Aristide before his first term (1991–1995), many of them, especially intellectuals like Myriam Merlet or Magalie Marcelin, condemned how the first democraticly elected president of Haiti ruled the country during his second term (2000–2004). Other observers, more favorable of the Fanmi Lavalas party, were more incline to criticised the period after the coup as a \"rewind\" back to the same dictatorship tactics, \"a terror campaign employing rape, murder and disappearance as tactics, and rapidly increasing insecurity undermining all economic activity of the informal sector.\"\n\nTo this day, Haiti is \"gripped by shocking levels of sexual violence against girls\"; of particular concern is the number of cases of sexual violence reported in the run-up to or during Carnival.\n\nAmnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have laid particular pressure on the duty of the state to act in due diligience necessary to prevent and eradicate violence and discrimination against women.\n\nThough the MINUSTAH has come with a peace-keeping mandate, a number of cases have arisen where the UN soldiers were found to have abused women.\n\nWomen in Haiti do not benefit from an equal access to education. The rural-urban difference is also considerable as nearly 25% of the women in urban areas have finished secondary school, compared with less than 2 percent in rural areas. Though most Latin American countries have achieved universal or near universal primary education for all children, for Haiti primary education, the enrollment rate of boys was still somewhat higher than that of girls in 1987, but it is narrowing as the average growth enrollment has been significantly greater for girls than for boys.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}
{"id": "43185049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43185049", "title": "World Elephant Day", "text": "World Elephant Day\n\nWorld Elephant Day is an international annual event on August 12, dedicated to the preservation and protection of the world's elephants. Conceived in 2011 by Canadian filmmakers Patricia Sims and Michael Clark of Canazwest Pictures, and Sivaporn Dardarananda, Secretary-General of the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation in Thailand, it was officially founded, supported and launched by Patricia Sims and the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation on August 12, 2012. Since that time, Patricia Sims continues to lead and direct World Elephant Day, which is now supported by over 65 wildlife organizations and many individuals in countries across the globe.\n\nThe goal of International Elephant Day is to create awareness of the urgent plight of African and Asian elephants, and to share knowledge and positive solutions for the better care and management of captive and wild elephants. African elephants are listed as \"Vulnerable\" and Asian elephants as \"Endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. One conservationist has stated that both African and Asian elephants face extinction within twelve years. The current population estimates are about 400,000 for African elephants and 40,000 for Asian elephants, although it has been argued that these numbers are much too high.\n\nThe first International Elephant Day was held on August 12, 2012. The film Return to the Forest, narrated by William Shatner, is about the reintroduction of captive Asian elephants to the wild and was released on the inaugural World Elephant Day. The follow-up feature film When Elephants Were Young, also narrated by William Shatner, depicts the life of a young man and young elephant in Thailand.\n\nThe demand for ivory, which is highest in China, leads to the illegal poaching of both African and Asian elephants. For example, one of the world's largest elephants, Satao, was recently killed for his iconic tusks. Another iconic Kenyan elephant, Mountain Bull, was also killed by poachers, and with the street value for ivory now exceeding that of gold, African elephants face a poaching epidemic. Elephants are also poached for meat, leather, and body parts, with the illegal wildlife trade putting elephants increasingly in danger, because it is perceived to be a low risk and high profit endeavor.\n\nThe loss of habitat due to deforestation, increases in mining, and agricultural activities has become problematic, especially for Asian elephants. The fragmentation of habitat also creates isolation - this makes breeding more difficult, and allows poachers to find the elephants and set traps more easily.\n\nHuman-elephant conflict is a significant concern, as human populations increase and forest cover decreases, forcing elephants into close proximity with human settlements. Incidents include crop damage and economic losses, as well as both elephant and human casualties.\n\nA lack of legislation regarding the care and treatment of elephants in zoos, circuses, and tourism often leads to their mistreatment. Captivity can be a serious threat to elephants, and Asian elephants are often illegally captured in the wild and trafficked into the lucrative tourism industry.\n\nMany notable celebrities have spoken out about the urgency of elephant protection, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Kristin Davis, William Shatner, Yao Ming, Prince William, Jorja Fox, Alec Baldwin, Stephen Fry, Ashley Judd, Jada Pinkett Smith, Kathryn Bigelow, and politicians such as Barack Obama, and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.\n\n"}
