{"id": "12752983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12752983", "title": "Banat Bulgarian dialect", "text": "Banat Bulgarian dialect\n\nBanat Bulgarian (Banat Bulgarian: \"Palćena balgarsćija jázić\" or \"Banátsća balgarsćija jázić\"; , ; ; ; ; ) is the outermost dialect of the Bulgarian language with standardized writing and an old literary tradition. It is spoken by the Banat Bulgarians in the Banat region, in Romania and Serbia. Officially, it is spoken by 8,000 people (1,658 in Serbia, and 6,500 in Romania), though other estimates give numbers up to 15,000.\n\nIn 1998, Jáni Vasilčin from Dudeştii Vechi translated the New Testament into Banat Bulgarian: \"Svetotu Pismu Novija Zákun.\" In 2017 published Ána Marijka Bodor an Banat Bulgarian translation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's \"The Little Prince\".\n\nThe Banat Bulgarians are predominantly Roman Catholic people. Their ancestors arrived in the region centuries ago from Northern Bulgaria. They settled in Oltenia under the Wallachian prince, then when Oltenia fell to the Ottomans, they fled to Hungary. The ancestor of the Banat Bulgarian language is the Paulician dialect, member of the Rup dialect group.\n\nIn the 1740s, Blasius Hristofor instituted the first school in Dudeştii Vechi in which Banat Bulgarian was taught using the Latin script. Some Bulgarian priests of the time already used the Latin alphabet, banned by the bishops. In the 19th century, the group's national consciousness strengthened and more Banat books were written. \n\nIn the 19th century, Banat Bulgarian schools used the Illyrian-Slavic language. In the course of using Illyrian-Slavic, the more Slovenisms entered the language.\n\nThe Hungarian Imre Berecz and the Croatian András Klobucsár wrote a few books in their mother tongue. Berecz wrote a catechism in Banat Bulgarian (1851). Klobucsár designed a prayer- and hymn-book. One of the teachers, János Uzun, also wrote secular verses. In 1866, József Rill standardised the Banat Bulgarian language and published \"Balgarsku právupisanj (Bulgarian Orthography).\" \n\nThe Balgarsku právupisanj was used to design coursebooks in Banat Bulgarian, including an ABC book and reader, together with \"Biblijata\" and \"Gulemija Kátaæizmus.\" Teacher Leopold Koszilkov was also translating Gospels. Fránc Glász and the German Ludovik Fischer wrote a prayer-book. This were notable works notables in Banat Bulgarian literature, as were very popular. The prayerbooks contain prayers, hymns and the biographies of saints. Koszilkov published calendars.\n\nBanat Bulgarians retained their language. Romanian and Serbian were used in schools, but in the catechisms henceforward Banat Bulgarian was used.\n\nThe vernacular of the Bulgarians of Banat can be classified as a Paulician dialect of the Eastern Bulgarian group. A typical feature is the \"ы\" (*y) vowel, which can either take an etymological place or replace \"i\". Other characteristic phonological features are the \"ê\" (wide \"e\") reflex of the Old Church Slavonic yat and the reduction of \"o\" into \"u\" and sometimes \"e\" into \"i\": \"puljé\" instead of \"pole\" (\"field\"), \"sélu\" instead of \"selo\" (\"village\"), \"ugništi\" instead of \"ognište\" (\"fireplace\"). Another feature is the palatalization of final consonants, which is typical for other Slavic languages but found only in some nonstandard dialects in Bulgarian (in such dialects the word \"den\" (\"day\") sounds like \"denj\") and not in standard Bulgarian.\n\nLexically, the language has borrowed many words from languages such as German (\"drot\" from \"Draht\", \"wire\"; \"gáng\" from \"Gang\", \"anteroom, corridor\"), Hungarian (\"vilánj\" from \"villany\", \"electricity\"; \"mozi\", \"cinema\"), Serbian (\"stvár\" from \"stvar\", \"item, matter\"; \"ráčun\" from \"račun\", \"account\"), and Romanian (\"šedinca\" from \"şedinţă\", \"conference\") due to the close contacts with the other peoples of the multiethnic Banat and the religious ties with other Roman Catholic peoples. Banat Bulgarian also has some older loanwords from Ottoman Turkish and Greek, which it shares with other Bulgarian dialects (e.g. \"hirgjén\" from Turkish \"ergen\", \"unmarried man, bachelor\"; \"trandáfer\" from Greek τριαντάφυλλο \"triantafyllo\", \"rose\"). Loanwords constitute around 20% of the Banat Bulgarian vocabulary. The names of some Banat Bulgarians are also influenced by Hungarian names, as the Hungarian (eastern) name order is sometimes used (family name followed by given name) and the female ending \"-a\" is often dropped from family names. Thus, \"Marija Velčova\" would become \"Velčov Marija\".\n\nIn addition to loanwords, the lexicon of Banat Bulgarian has also acquired calques and neologisms, such as \"svetica\" (\"icon\", formerly used \"ikona\" and influenced by German \"Heiligenbild\"), \"zarno\" (\"bullet\", from the word meaning \"grain\"), \"oganbalváč\" (\"volcano\", literally \"fire belcher\"), and \"predhurta\" (\"foreword\").\n\nThe Banat Bulgarian language has its own alphabet largely based on the Croatian alphabet (Gaj's Latin Alphabet) and preserves many features that are archaic in the language spoken in Bulgaria. Banat Bulgarian was codified as early as 1866 and is used in literature and the media, which distinguishes it from other Bulgarian dialects.\n\nThe following is the Banat Bulgarian Latin alphabet:\n\n"}

{"id": "20333839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20333839", "title": "Basque literature", "text": "Basque literature\n\nAlthough the first instances of coherent Basque phrases and sentences go as far back as the San Millán glosses of around 950, the large-scale damage done by periods of great instability and warfare, such as the clan wars of the Middle Ages, the Carlist Wars and the Spanish Civil War, led to the scarcity of written material predating the 16th century.\n\nThe earliest surviving traces of Basque literary activity go back to the 16th century, but significant production does not seem to have set in until the 17th century. Since the end of the Francoist period in Spain, the formation of a standard language, and the large scale introduction of Basque into the education system consequently increased literary activity. While much of the literature written in Basque remains targeted at the native audience, some works by Basque authors have been translated into other languages, such as Bernardo Atxaga, and achieved global recognition.\n\nA few songs from the 16th century have survived, such as the \"Song of the Battle of Beotibar\" that deals with the battle fought in 1321 and a group of verses known as \"The Burning of Mondragón\" from the time of the Basque Clan Wars.\n\nThe earliest piece of prose written in Basque is a letter composed in 1537 by the Biscayan Juan de Zumárraga from Durango, the first bishop of Mexico.\n\nOnly a few years later in 1545, the first book known to have been put into print is published - a collection of poems fashioned by Bernard Etxepare, a priest from Lower Navarre in the Northern Basque Country, by the title \"Linguæ Vasconum Primitiæ\" (\"Beginnings of the Basque Language\"). In this book, Etxepare expresses his hopes that the first publication of a book in Basque will serve to invigorate the language and culture. His efforts were undoubtedly influenced by wider movements in Europe at the time that encouraged literary production in vernacular languages rather than Latin.\n\nThe next publication is a recently discovered pastoral play by Joan Perez de Lazarraga (1548?—1605) by the name of \"Silbero, Silbia, Doristeo and Sirena\" produced between 1564 and 1567 in Larrea, Alava, making it the earliest surviving play in Basque. With 102 pages (some damaged) it is also the longest early text.\n\n1571 saw the publication of Joanes Leizarraga's New Testament translation into a standardised form of his Lapurdian dialect, promoted by Jeanne d'Albret, Queen of Navarre. He also wrote a small number of other religious works.\n\nThe closing years of the 16th century see another publication, this time from the South, of a collection of proverbs written in the Biscayan dialect called \"Refranes y sentencias\" by an unknown author. However, by this time, the centre of Basque literary production had firmly established itself to the north of the Pyrenees, in Lower Navarre and the French provinces of Labourd and Soule, where it would remain for several centuries.\n\nAlthough dialectal differences are clearly visible in these early texts, it is also clear that the differences in the 16th century were considerably smaller than they are today.\n\nIn amongst the trickle of smaller religious works the Counter Reformation movement, which in the Basque Country had its centre in Sare, Soule, produced one of the most notable works of the 17th century, This was a religious publication, called \"Gero\", the preachings of Pedro Agerre (better known as \"Axular\") but in literary form, published in 1643. Although he was born in Urdax in Navarre and working in Soule, he wrote in Lapurdian, which by then had established itself as the most prestigious form of Basque.\n\nOther important works of this century were:\n\n\nAlthough Gipuzkoan and Biscayan enjoyed some status as literary dialects, Lapurdian was by far the most commonly used dialect of the 17th century.\n\nSome referential figures of 20th century Basque literature are Telesforo Monzon, Salbatore Mitxelena, Gabriel Aresti, Nikolas Ormaetxea, Txillardegi (pen name of José Luis Álvarez Enparantza), Joxe Azurmendi, Ramon Saizarbitoria, Bernardo Atxaga, or Joseba Sarrionandia. In addition, there are many Basque writers who have written in Spanish: Blas de Otero, and Gabriel Celaya.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Spanish Civil War halted all Basque cultural and literary production for almost two decades. The most affected domain was that of language and the creation of texts in Basque. The bulk of Basque writers died or escaped to exile, where they undertook some attempts to revitalize literature by writing books or launching magazines of limited circulation.\n\nHowever, some works were not even published during that period. In the Southern Basque Country, during the 1950s new generations undertook efforts to write a new type of literature along European lines, innovating both in content and form, despite being heavily conditioned by Francoist censorship.\n\nThe most typical traits of Basque literature during history have gradually shifted up to the present time. A number of consistent characteristics have been pinpointed, like the emphasis on folk, ethnological and mythological elements. Jon Kortazar underscores the \"uncertainty between the epic sense and playfulness\".\n\nBetween 1545 and 1974, 4,000 books were published in the Basque language, whereas between 1974 and 1995 12,500 were published. Modern Basque publishing began with the establishment of Elkar in 1972, a small publishing company based in Bayonne in the French Basque country. After the death of Franco, Elkar established a second publishing operation in San Sebastián in the Spanish Basque country. Although a number of other Basque publishing houses have been subsequently established, Elkar remains the largest.\n\n\n"}

The term was coined by journalist Juan Carlos Zapata to \"define the oligarchy that has developed under the protection of the Chavez government\".\n\nCorruption among the Boliburguesía and Chavez-administration sympathizers has moved millions of dollars with the complicity of public officials, with some becoming rich under the guise of socialism. Henry Ramos Allup, general secretary of opposition party Democratic Action, has said corruption in the financial industry and other sectors of Venezuela is tied to government officials of the Chávez administration. Following the death of Chavez, the Boliburguesía became more powerful and held more influence over Venezuela during the presidency of Nicolás Maduro.\n\nDuring Chávez's tenure, he seized thousands of properties and businesses while also reducing the footprint of foreign companies. Venezuela's economy was then largely state-run and was operated by military officers that had their business and government affairs connected. Senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Harold Trinkunas, stated that involving the military in business was \"a danger\", with Trinkunas explaining that the Venezuelan military \"has the greatest ability to coerce people, into business like they have\". According to \"Bloomberg Business\", \"[b]y showering contracts on former military officials and pro-government business executives, Chavez put a new face on the system of patronage\".\n\n, who was appointed Minister of Finance by President Chávez, was accused of using public funds by opposition deputy Ismael García and was described as participating in a \"network of corruption\" by the United States Department of State. Andrade travels to the United States through a private Learjet 45 worth $10 million that is registered in Delaware. He had invested in horses for show jumping, having a horse farm attributed to Andrade's firm in South Carolina. Alejandro's son, Emanuel, was also sponsored by his father and is a decorated show jumping jockey and own multiple horses that are worth up to millions of dollars and studs that can earn profits from breeding. Andrade also hired a public relations firm, Starting Gate Communications, an organization that specializes in equestrian activities for his son. In March 2018, it was reported that United States authorities were investigating Andrade for money laundering and funneling Venezuelan state funds into his own interests.\n\nThe brother of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) politician Jesse Chacón, Arné Chacón, established a stable in Florida called Gadu Racing Stable Corp. and had horses compete in races in the United States until he was arrested in 2009. Brother of Ronald Sanchez the National Superintendent of Securities of Venezuela, Tomás Sánchez had a second stable, Rontos Racing Stable Corp., created that was signed by the same Gadu agent two months later. Ronald Sanchez was also accused of being involved in an extortion scandal in Miami by Venezuelan banker Thomas Vasquez in a testimony involving the case. The Rontos Racing Stable Corp. also own an apartment in the Trump Towers Miami building that was quoted at $625,000 in 2011.\n\nRicardo Fernández Barrueco was a \"modest business entrepreneur\" in Caracas until he helped Chávez circumvent oil strikes initiated in 2002. In less than ten years, he had gained a net worth of $1.6 billion and created a combination of about 70 companies. He owned businesses in Panama, Ecuador and the United States and bought multiple financial institutions in 2008. In Miami, Fernandez bought a luxury apartment in the Jade at Brickell Bay, a home to many celebrities. In late 2009, Fernandez was arrested in Venezuela for unknown reasons and his companies were nationalized by President Chávez. He was released from prison in May 2014.\n\nVíctor Vargas Irausquín is a Venezuelan banker who helped the Chávez administration raise funds to finance Venezuela's budget. According to the United States Department of State, Vargas was \"said to have made a profit off those negotiations\" and was described as \"a banker whose star has risen greatly during the Chávez presidency\". Vargas was also assisted by the Venezuelan government for abiding by their policies during the Venezuelan banking crisis of 2009–2010, when more than a half-dozen private banking institutions were closed.\n\nWhile Chávez was President, he stayed in the most expensive locations, with hundreds of individuals composing his entourage that included masseuses, chefs, tailors and Cuban doctors. Chávez and his family also wore designer clothes along with high-end fashion accessories and jewelry, with brand names including Cartier, Dolce & Gabbana and Patek Philippe & Co. among others. The daughters of Chávez have been seen with celebrities such as Justin Bieber, traveling internationally visiting places such as Disneyland Paris, New York City and Patagonia while also attending concerts of Madonna.\n\nMembers of the Chávez family live in a suburb of Barinas, Chávez's birthplace, occupying a mansion that is enclosed off from the public by walls topped with razor wire. Asdrubal Chávez, Chávez's cousin, is vice president of production and trade of PDVSA and is in charge of the majority of oil contracts. Chávez's brothers also hold positions in the Venezuelan government. Argenisis is the president of the state-run energy company CORPOELEC and Hannibal is the mayor of Sabaneta. In 2004, the Drug Enforcement Administration estimates showed that the family was possibly worth $140 million. In 2013, it was estimated that the Chávez family had liquid assets of about $550 million in multiple international bank accounts.\n\nThough Chávez denounced hypocritical socialists and criticized those who bought luxury vehicles such as Hummers, he and his family acquired multiple vehicles during his presidency, including aircraft such as the Bombardier Challenger 605 and Gulfstream G550 and automobiles like the Bentley Mulsanne and Chevrolet LUV D-Max as well as multiple Hummers and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.\n\nIt is estimated that the Chávez family owns 17 estates totaling more than 100,000 acres. Each estate cost between $400,000 and $700,000, with the estates having their own roads. According to state legislator and Chávez critic Wilmer Azuaje, members of Chávez's family live in mansions in Alto Barinas and children of the family have their own waiting staff in their school's dining hall.\n\nThe families of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores have benefitted from supporting the Bolivarian government. Flores has been accused of nepotism with individuals claiming that several of her close relatives became employees of the National Assembly while she was in office.\n\nTwo nephews of Cilia Flores, Efraín Antonio Campos Flores and Francisco Flores de Freites, have also been involved in illicit activities such as drug trafficking, with some of their funds possibly assisting President Maduro's presidential campaign in the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election and potentially for the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary elections. One informant stated that the two would often fly out of Terminal 4 of Simon Bolivar Airport, a terminal reserved for the President.\n\nWalter Jacobo Gavidia Flores, Flores' son who is a Caracas judge, is being investigated for relations to drug trafficking as well. Flores' son, whose last salary through 2015 was less than $1,000, made multiple international trips in 2015 and 2016 on private flights costing approximately $20,000 per trip. Gavidia Flores spent most of his time in the United States, though he also took chartered flights to France, Germany, Malta and Spain.\n\nCarlos Aem Flores, a relative of Flores, has also been linked to her two nephews involved in drug trafficking. Carlos Aem Flores, a self-described \"producer\", has been seen at various government facilities \"working\" close to Bolivarian officials such as President Maduro and the National Assembly. He has been seen sporting luxury brands of Cartier, Hublot, Louis Vuitton and Rolex and driving a special Transformers edition Chevrolet Camaro, a Ferrari F430, a Mercedes-AMG and a Porsche 911 GT2.\n\nOn 14 March 2015 at the wedding of Jose Zalt, a Syrian-Venezuelan businessman that owns the clothing brand Wintex, Maduro's son Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra was seen being showered with American dollars at the gathering in the luxurious Gran Melia Hotel in Caracas. The incident caused outrage among Venezuelans who believed this to be hypocritical of President Maduro, especially since many Venezuelans were experiencing hardships due to the poor state of the economy and due to the President's public denouncements of capitalism.\n\nIn March 2017, \"Runrunes\" reported that Citgo, a subsidiary of Venezuela's PDVSA, was loaned money to purchase two private aircraft for a total of $119 million. This occurred days after President Maduro called for assistance from the United Nations, asking for help to combat medicine shortages. The first aircraft, a Bombardier Global 6000 costing $54 million, would be used by Venezuela's Minister of Energy and Mines Nelson Martínez while the second aircraft, a Bombardier Global 8000 costing $65 million, would be used by President Maduro after its development was finalized. CITGO would then deliver its Dassault Falcon 2000 to be used by Maduro as well after receiving the Global 6000.\n\nIn Florida, Boliburgueses are favored clients of real estate businesses, private jet companies, luxury car dealers, fine horse breeders and luxury stores. According to a business owner of an electronics store at the Bal Harbour Shops of Miami Beach, the success of selling luxury electronics made of valuable metals and gems is attributed to boliburgueses, with some buying gold iPads and gold cellular phones priced between $8,000 and $45,000.\n\nBoliburgueses had also bought luxury automobiles from foreign countries, including luxury Hummer SUVs and Rolls Royce cars.\n\nThe scandal known as the \"Maletinazo\" also generated criticism in which the government of Chávez was alleged to be sending state oil money from PDVSA to finance the political campaign of former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

In Adomnan's account, when Columba met Broichan and Bridei at the king's fortress near the river ness, Columba demanded that the girl be released but the wizard refused. Columba then went down to the river and told his companions that an angel at that moment had struck Broichan, and his cup had fallen from his hand and he was deathly ill. Moments later two messengers from King Bridei came to inform Columba of these events as they happened, and Columba gave his own messengers a pebble from the River Ness and told them that if Broichan agreed to release the slave-girl, then they were instructed to place the pebble in a cup of water and make him drink it, but if Broichan refused, then he would die immediately. They then went back to the fortress and Broichan agreed to release the girl, and so they placed the pebble in a cup of water, and it miraculously floated on top. Broichan drank from it and was healed. The pebble was then kept at the fortress and used whenever someone needed healing for a disease, but it could not be found when the time for someone to die had really come, and so on the day when King Bridei was about to die, they couldn't find the pebble anywhere.\n\nAdomnan also recorded a story about Broichan in the same vicinity of Pictland. In the second story, Columba and his companions were getting into a boat on Loch Ness and preparing to leave, but Broichan used his magic to summon the weather against Columba and so the winds went against him. Columba then called on Christ's name and ordered the sails to be raised, and miraculously the boat then went off at a high speed directly into the oncoming wind that was blowing against them.\n\n"}

Most came from Guangdong Province. Since the 1970s, the new arrivals have typically hailed from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Latin American Chinatowns may include the descendants of original migrants — often of mixed Chinese and Latino parentage — and more recent immigrants from East Asia. Most Asian Latin Americans are of Cantonese and Hakka origin.\nEstimates widely vary on the number of Chinese Descendants in Latin America but it is at least \n1.4 million and likely much greater than this.\n\nUnlike the Chinatowns of Anglo America and Europe, pure-blood ethnic Chinese were relatively few in number but now increasing rapidly due to generally lower levels of Chinese immigration to some parts of Latin America. Residents of Latin American Chinatowns tend to be multilingual. Latin America's Chinatowns include those of Mexico City, Havana, Buenos Aires, and Lima. Some of these Chinatowns mainly serve as tourist attractions and not as true, living ethnic communities. The Chinatown of Havana, Cuba's is largely multi-generation Spanish-speaking Chinese Cuban whereas the Chinatown of the Belgrano district of Buenos Aires, Argentina consists of many first-generation Holo- and Mandarin-speaking immigrants from Taiwan.\n\nPolitically, several nations of Latin America recognize the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan. A Chinese arch was presented as a gift to the Barrio Chino of Panama City, following the visit of Panama by the then Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. After the major official visit by the Cuban Revolution's Fidel Castro to the People's Republic of China in 1995, materials were given for the new Chinese arch on Calle Dragone in Havana's Barrio Chino.\n\nIt is centered on Arribeños, Mendoza and Montañeses Streets, in the middle-class neighbourhood of Belgrano, Buenos Aires. Large numbers of recent Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese immigrants have settled in the area. Also included are ethnic Chinese from other parts of the Americas and East Asia, and Asians of non-Chinese ancestry, mainly Japanese and Korean, whose first immigrants date from WWII and the Korean war.\n\nSignificant population of Chinese Brazilian live in Liberdade area in São Paulo. There are 3 million Chinese immigrants living in Brazil, while 2 million living in São Paulo area, significant population can also be found in capital Brasília. Many Chinese immigrants settled to São Paulo following the end of Chinese civil war in 1949. Most of the Chinese are Taiwanese descent while some of them are descended from Hong Kong and Macau\n\nChinese immigration to Cuba started in 1847 when Spanish settlers brought in Cantonese contract workers to work in the sugar fields. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in from China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan during the following decades to replace the labor of African slaves. After completing 8-year contracts, the Chinese immigrants generally settled permanently in Cuba, where their descendants have since intermarried with local Cubans.\n\nUnlike that of Argentina and other Latin American countries, the overseas Chinese population of Cuba was once large, but the now-diminished Chinese Cuban community is today clustered around the largely dying \"Barrio Chino\" — called \"Barrio Chino de La Habana\" — on Calle Zanja, in Havana. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, many Chinese Cuban entrepreneurs fled the country for the United States. Since the 1960s, Cuba has not attracted very many, if any, Chinese immigrants (developments or redevelopments of Chinatowns tend to require much private investments for which political conditions in Cuba are not favorable).\n\nOnly one Chinese-language newspaper, \"Kwong Wah Po\", remains in Cuba. Havana's Chinatown was formerly among the largest in Latin America as the neighborhood comprised 44 square blocks during its prime. To tie in with the Revolution's economic reliance on tourism, attempts have recently been launched to attract revitalization investment for the Chinatown from Mainland Chinese state-run enterprises and overseas Chinese private investors, particularly Chinese Canadians.\n\nBetween 1,200 and 1,500 Chinese workers in Peru offered support to the Chilean side in the War of the Pacific (1879-1883) and thus went to Chile at the war's end.\n\nMost Chinese shops, supermarkets, and restaurants located in Barrio Patronato neighborhood in Santiago. However, some Chinese businesses can also be found in shopping centers such as Santiago Centro and Estación Central\n\nThe city of Cali has the largest Asian community because of its proximity to the Pacific Coast. The Chinese population can also be found in Barranquilla and Medellin. A small Chinatown exist in capital city Bogotá, especially in San Victorino area.\n\nThe first Chinese immigrants to Mexico came from China, some were Philippine-born Chinese, brought by the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade . However most contemporary Chinese immigrants came to Mexico during the 20th century as contract workers and political refugees. With the rise of anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico in the 1930s under President Plutarco Elías Calles, most Chinese Mexicans, including individuals of mixed Chinese and Mexican descent, were forced out of Mexico and deported to China.\n\nMexico City's small \"barrio chino\" is on Calle Dolores in Cuauhtémoc borough in the city center.\n\nThe border city of Mexicali, Baja California, contains the second largest concentration of Chinese Mexicans in Mexico. The neighborhood is located on Avenida Madero Calle Azueta, is called \"La Chinesca\" (The \"Chinesque\" one). Some of the earliest Chinese settlers who arrived in the United States eventually went south to Mexico to escape institutionalized anti-Chinese persecution in California. The largest number of new Cantonese-speaking Chinese immigrants came mostly from the Guangzhou area around 1919. Mexicali had a local chapter of the Kuomintang. There is now a consulate of the People's Republic of China in Mexicali as well as one in nearby Tijuana. The economic problems of Mexico in the 1980s led many Chinese-Mexicans to migrate north into the United States. Today, members of the multi-generational Chinese-Mexican community own and operate many businesses across the city. One of the oldest Chinese restaurants, Restaurant 19, is named after one of the early Mexican Chinatown corridors, Alley 19, which opened December 18, 1928, and eventually closed in winter 2001. It was one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Mexico. This restaurant was utilized by many U.S. and Mexican officials and celebrities throughout the years; its end eventually came due to the devaluation of the peso in the 1980s and the new border crossing that takes tourist and locals away from the original heart of Mexicali. Currently there are more than 80 Chinese restaurants from small coffee shops \"(cafés de chinos)\" to huge 750 occupancy dining rooms. Nowadays, there are about 2,000 Chinese Mexicans living in the city; however, there are 100,000 residents more than thought who are of Chinese descent .\n\nThe Chinese enclave in the Mexican city of Tijuana is located in La Mesa. The enclave is home to 15,000 ethnic Chinese immigrants as of 2012, a number that has tripled from about 5,000 in 2009. The enclave is the second largest after the American enclave. The mayor of Tijuana Jorge Hank Rhon had received negative publicity from the local newspapers for his support for the official establishment of the Chinatown as there is general negative sentiment from locals who view China as a major rival for trade with the United States. There are various official events held during the summer recognizing the area in Tijuana's La Mesa District. Tijuana's Chinese community started around the late 1800s to the early 1900s when the Chinese immigrants to the United States fled California during a period called the \"yellow peril\". As Tijuana was a border town, it was an important city towards the establishment of the Mexicali Chinatown, where at the time, the Chinese community would outnumber Mexicans 2 to 1. Though the numbers were far fewer in Tijuana, thousands would come through Tijuana on their way to Ensenada and Mexicali, a journey usually by foot for 120 miles to the east. By the 1920s, the Chinese numbering around 15,000 would concentrate in Mexicali to avoid the Mexican civil war. Racism would keep the population small for many decades until the early 2000s when Aeromexico would first offer direct flights from Tijuana to Japan. In 2008, the airline would offer direct flights to Shanghai, making Tijuana the only Mexican city to offer such a route. The author has attributed the immigrant Chinese population rise to the direct flight, where there were 5,000 Chinese immigrants in 2009 and 15,000 by 2012. In 2012, the Chinese community started making the enclave known in 2012, whereas the community largely kept to itself in years prior. The Chinatown is one of the few recent Chinatowns that was not created from commercial ventures.\n\nThe main Panamanian Chinatown is located in Panama City and is called the \"Barrio Chino\", located in the neighborhood of San Felipe in the City of Panama. It consist of four Portals, beginning in Carlos A. Mendoza Street, covering Veraguas Street and part of the Eloy Alfaro and B Avenue. Most of the traditional Chinese shops are located in Carlos A. Mendoza Street, where you can find all kind of shops, which range from food, articles for parties and events, Chinese curiosities and a traditional Chinese food restaurante.\n\nThe main Peruvian Chinatown is located in Lima and is called the \"Barrio Chino\", located on Calle Capón (Block 7 of Ucayali Street); it is one of the two earliest Chinatowns in the Western Hemisphere, and contains various notably Chinese architectural features.\n\nOther Peruvian cities with notable Chinese-Peruvian populations include Chimbote, Trujillo, and Chiclayo, all on the north coast, where Chinese immigrants were brought to work on sugar cane plantations. Historical Chinese immigration to the Amazonian region of Peru may be documented in a small village intriguingly named \"Chino\" several miles outside of Iquitos.\n\nVenezuela is also home to one of Latin America's largest concentrations of ethnic Chinese.The city of Valencia, Carabobo home of the major Chinese community hosts various markets devoted to Chinese culture where can be found from smoked ducks to authentic pottery. A local newspaper is also edited in Chinese. Not less relevant a lively \"barrio chino\" can be found on Avenida Principal El Bosque in the El Bosque district of Caracas.\n\nCantonese is widely spoken among Chinese Venezuelans, especially the variety commonly known as Hoisan or Toisan, but there has been recent Taiwanese immigration, adding to the linguistic and cultural diversity. Chinese from other places of the world also settled in Venezuela, especially from the Philippines, where they were experienced persecution in the 1970s under Ferdinand Marcos, and Cuba, where Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution seized their businesses.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39750", "title": "Colour guard", "text": "Colour guard\n\nIn military organizations, a colour guard (or \"color guard\") is a detachment of soldiers assigned to the protection of regimental colours. This duty is so prestigious that the colour is generally carried by a young officer (Ensign), while experienced non-commissioned officers (colour sergeants) are assigned to the protection of the flag. These NCOs, accompanied sometimes by warrant officers (as is the case in several countries), can be ceremonially armed with either sabres or rifles to protect the colour. Colour guards are generally dismounted, but there are also mounted colour guard formations as well.\n\nAs armies became trained and adopted set formations, each regiment's ability to keep its formation was potentially critical to its, and therefore its army's, success. In the chaos of battle, not least due to the amount of dust and smoke on a battlefield, soldiers needed to be able to determine where their regiment was. Flags and banners have been used by many armies in battle to serve this purpose.\n\nRegimental flags were generally awarded to a regiment by a head-of-State during a ceremony and colours may be inscribed with battle honours or other symbols representing former achievements. They were therefore treated with reverence as they represented the honour and traditions of the regiment. The loss of a unit's flag was not only shameful, but losing this central point of reference could make the unit break up. So regiments tended to adopt colour guards, a detachment of experienced or élite soldiers, to protect their colours. As a result, the capture of an enemy's standard was considered as a great feat of arms.\n\nDue to the advent of modern weapons, and subsequent changes in tactics, colours are no longer used in battle, but continue to be carried by colour guards at events of formal character.\n\nColour guards are used in the military throughout the Commonwealth of Nations, including Australia, Canada, Jamaica, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. A colour guard unit typically consists of the standard-bearer, who is of the rank of second lieutenant or equivalent (pilot officer or sub-lieutenant), positioned in the centre of the colour guard, flanked by two or more individuals, typically armed with rifles or sabres. A colour sergeant major typically stands behind the colours carrying a pace stick. So, the formation (when the colours are combined on parade) is as follows:\n\n\nAside from presenting arms and sabres, colour guards of the Commonwealth of Nations are expected to lower their flags to the ground in full and regular salutes in ceremonies and parades. Civilians should stand during such times and soldiers are expected to salute them when not in formation.\n\nAs the British Army, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy have several types of colours, there are also colour guards for these colours and these colours and their colour guards are as follows:\n\n\nIn the cavalry, the Queen's Standard or Guidon and the Regimental/Squadron Standard or Guidon (for the light cavalry only) are the equivalents to the Queen's and Regimental Colours.\n\nColour guards in the artillery units are technically the lead gun's crew and leader (except in the Honourable Artillery Company which uses both guns and Colours) and there are no colour guards in the rifle regiments (nowadays The Rifles), the Royal Gurkha Rifles (which use the Queen's Truncheon) and in the Royal Hospital in Chelsea.\n\nAll of the RN's Queen's Colours are identical. Within the RN a colour guard unit consists of:\n\n\n\n\nIn the Chinese People's Liberation Army, colour guards composed of\n\n\nIn the parades of the 1950s, this configuration was present in every unit of the PLA up to the parade of 1959.\n\nSince 1981, the PLA has continued a tradition of the color guard detail with the PLA flag leading the Beijing Garrison Honor Guard Battalion in military parades. In December 2017, the Beijing Garrison Color Guard Company of the People's Armed Police, which is present during flag ceremonies in Tiananmen Square in Beijing carrying the national flag, was officially attached to the honor guard battalion.\n\nFrench colour guards are composed of:\n\n\nThe colour guards of France's military academies tend to wear swords; those of NCO schools, other educational institutions and active units carry rifles instead. This design is used in other countries with Francophone populations.\n\nFrench color guards render honors on the command of present arms (présentez arme). On command, the 2 NCOs and 3 enlisted will execute present arms, whether it be by presenting their sabre vertically or by putting the right hand over the handle of their weapon while the ensign lowers the national color/unit color somewhere close to their legs. On some occasions, the flag is not lowered unless the guard is in the presence of a dignitary (such as the President of the Republic) or a military leader (such as the Chief of the Defence Staff).\n\n\"Pasukan Penjaga Panji-Panji/Pataka/Tunggul\" is the Indonesian term for a colour guard unit in the Indonesian National Armed Forces, the Indonesian National Police and the Municipal Police Units. These are modeled on the former Dutch practice and are led by a colour sergeant (massed colour guards are led on parade by a junior officer). \"Panji-Panji\" means \"Service Colours\" in Indonesian. The Colour guard uniform in Indonesia is all-white uniform with a white ceremonial combat helmet similar to the M1 helmet and white boots. If in the Armed Forces and the National Police, the escort personnel carry the M1, M-16, FN FAL or Pindad SSD-1 rifle while the colour officer carries his/her sabre.\nComposition of the Indonesian colour guard unit\n\nThe Dutch armed forces have similar ranks corresponding to a colour guard, the \"vaandrig\" and \"kornet\" (aspirant officers who have not been sworn in yet).\n\nRussian colour guards are composed of:\n\n\nActive units, military academies, and guards of honor carry sabers in the color guard, if needed, rifles may be substituted. The same design is used for color guards in countries of the CIS. If there are multiple color guards marching in a parade at the same time, one guard is required to march directly behind the first guard. During the Soviet era, the Soviet flag was never allowed to be paraded by a military color guard, with military and regimental flags only being paraded in color guards. On occasion during the Soviet era, the Victory Banner was also used in color guard teams, with the last known occasions being in 1975, 1977, 1985, 1987 and 1990. Turkmenistan and until 2014, Ukraine, were the only countries in the CIS whose army color guards dipped their flags as a salute.\n\nGiven a shared heritage with Austria and Turkey plus its own traditions, the modern Serbian Armed Forces maintains a colour guard component. Every unit of the Armed Forces has a colour company that is made up of:\n\n\nIn Sweden the colour guard can be composed in three distinct manners: Greater colour guard, smaller colour guard and an officers guard. Each regiment, or military unit that carries a colour, in Sweden sets up its own colour guard. The Swedish military rank of fänrik (and the corresponding cavalry rank of \"kornet\") was originally intended for the holder of the company flag. This duty was considered so prestigious that an officer was necessary to carry it out. Today, it is a regular officer rank.\n\nThis is composed of two commissioned officers, called \"fanförare\" (\"carriers of the colour\") and eight enlisted soldiers. This stems from the time of king Gustavus Adolphus and the Thirty years war when all Swedish regiments had eight battalions. Each battalion contributed one soldier to the common colour guard.\n\nThis is composed of one commissioned officer and four enlisted soldiers.\n\nThis is composed of three commissioned officers.\n\nIn the military of the United States, the \"color guard\" (where the word color is referring to the national flag) carries the National Color and other flags appropriate to its position in the chain of command. Typically these include a unit flag and a departmental flag (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, or Coast Guard). In addition to the flag bearers, who are positioned in the center of the color guard, there are two or more individuals who carry rifles and or sabres. This is a symbol that the flag (and its nation) will always be protected.\n\nIn the U.S., traditionally, the unit's sergeant major is responsible for the safeguarding, care, and display of the organizational colors. The sergeant major is also responsible for the selection, training, and performance of the members. The color guard consists of enlisted members and is commanded by the senior (color) Sergeant, who carries the National Color and gives the necessary commands for movements and rendering honors during drill exercises or parade ceremonies.\n\nBeing assigned to the color guard is considered an honor due to the fact that these individuals present and carry the symbols of their unit and country. Depending on the circumstance and subject to the orders of their commander, members may wear full dress or less formal uniforms. It is mandatory for all members of the color guard to wear headgear, for example, a garrison cap, beret, or service cap. On occasion, certain color guards can be horse-mounted.\n\nA US color guard is made up of a \"Color Sergeant\" carrying the National Colors, a unit or command \"Color Bearer\", and two \"Color Escorts\".\n\nThe color guard is formed and marched in one rank at close interval (shoulder-to-shoulder). Since the National Colors must always be in the position of honor on the right, the color guard must execute a special movement to reverse direction. It does not execute rear march, nor does it execute about face. Rather, it performs a maneuver derived from the standard countercolumn command, generally known as \"counter march\" or \"colors reverse march\", in order to keep the precedence of flags in order.\nOther drill movements performed by the color guard include presenting arms, left and right wheel (turns) marches, eyes right (upon passing the reviewing stand during a parade), casing/uncasing the colors, and fixing/unfixing bayonets (by the arms bearers).\n\nThe color guard renders honors when the national anthem is played or sung, when passing in review during a parade, or in certain other circumstances. In these cases, the unit and departmental flags salute by dipping (leaning the flag forward). However, with the exception of a response to a naval salute, the United States national flag renders no salute. This is enshrined in the United States Flag Code and U.S. law.\n\nIn the U.S. military, individuals or units passing or being passed by uncased (unfurled) colors render honors when outdoors. Individuals who are not part of any formation begin the hand salute when the colors are six paces distant and hold it until they have passed six paces beyond the colors.\n\nCivilians are expected to stand at the position of attention with their right hand placed over their heart for the same period, and the hand salute applies to the uniformed organizations as well (especially the Boy Scouts of America). Since recently, veterans are expected to hand salute the colors too, like their military counterparts including personnel not in uniform.\n\n\n"}

A location in which a crew works is called a crewyard or a workyard. The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command. Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company.

The matrilineal system of the Akan continues to be economically and politically important. Each lineage controlled the land farmed by its members, functioned as a religious unit in the veneration of its ancestors, supervised marriages, and settled internal disputes among its members.\n\nAkan kings, once renowned for their splendor and wealth, retained dignitary status after colonization. Celebration of the Akan kings lives on in the tradition of the Golden Stool. The Akan are noted for their expertise in several forms of craftwork, particularly their weaving, wood carving, ceramics, fertility dolls, metallurgy and kente cloth). Traditional \"kente\" cloth is woven outdoors, exclusively by men, in complex patterns of bright, narrow strips. The manufacturing of many Akan crafts is restricted to male specialists. Pottery-making is the only craft that is primarily a female activity; men usually fashion pots or pipes depicting anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures.\n\nThe various Akan groups speak various dialects of the Akan language, a language rich in proverbs, and the use of proverbs is considered to be a sign of wisdom. Euphemisms are also very common, especially concerning events connected with death.\n\nThe coastal Akans were the first to have relations with Europeans during the \"Scramble for Africa\". As a result of this long association, these groups absorbed aspects of British culture and language. For example, it became customary among these peoples to adopt British surnames. The coastal Akans live predominantly in the Central Region and Western Region of Akanland.\n\nThe Ga-Adangbe people \"or simply\" Ga people (named for the common proto-Ga-Adangbe ancestral language) inhabit the Greater Accra Region. The Adangbe inhabit the eastern plain, while the Ga groups occupy the western portions of the Accra coastlands. Both languages are derived from a common root language, and modern Ga and Adangbe languages are still similar today.\n\nDespite the archeological evidence that photo-Ga-Adangbe-speakers relied on millet and yam cultivation, the modern Ga-Adangbe reside in what used to be fishing communities, and more than 75 percent of the Ga-Adangbe live in urban centers. The presence of major industrial, commercial, and governmental institutions in the city and towns, as well as increasing migration of other people into the area, has not prevented the Ga people from maintaining aspects of their traditional culture, even though Twi is an important immigrant language in their lands. As a result, they have dynamic\n\nThe Dagomba speak Dagbani language (Dagbane). The Dagomba reside in Dagbon (Northern Ghana). For centuries, the area inhabited by Dagomba peoples has been the scene of movements of people engaged in conquest, expansion, and north-south and east-west trade. Many terms from Arabic, Hausa and Dyula are seen in the Dagbani language, due to the importance of trans-saharan trade and West African trade and the historic impact that the Islamic religion has had in the area.\n\nThe Ewe people occupy southeastern Ghana and parts of neighboring Togo and Benin. The Ewe follow a patrilineal structure, meaning that the founder of a community becomes chief and is usually succeeded by his paternal relatives. Ewe religion is organized around a creator or deity, Mawu, and over 600 other deities. The Ewe are more traditionally inclined in terms of religion and belief. Many village celebrations and ceremonies take place in honor of one or more deities.\n\nCoastal Ewe depend on the fishing trade, while inland Ewe are usually farmers and keep livestock. The local variations in economic activities have led to craft specialization. The Ewe also weave kente cloth, often in geometrical patterns and symbolic designs that have been handed down through the ages.\n\nWomen in pre-modern society were seen as bearers of children, retailers of fish, and farmers. Traditionally, women's childbearing abilities were perceived as a way for lineage ancestors to be reborn. In pre-colonial times, polygamy was encouraged, especially by wealthy men. In patrilineal societies, dowry received from marrying off daughters was traditionally seen as an acknowledgment to parents for raising their daughters well. In the last couples of decades, the female gender roles have evolved tremendously. Ghanaian women now comprise 43.1% of the working class in Ghana. Females have climbed to the upper leadership echelons of politics, career, business, and all other sectors. Notable political personalities include Joyce Bamford-Addo (Speaker of the 5th Session of the Parliament), Georgina Theodora Wood (Chief Justice) as well as multiple past and current political office holders. \n\nThe Panafest celebrates roots, and African-Americans with roots from the region, often visit and celebrate their heritage.\n\nThere are three distinct types of music: ethnic or traditional music, normally played during festivals and at funerals; \"highlife\" music, which is a blend of traditional and ‘imported’ music; and choral music, which is performed in concert halls, churches, schools, and colleges.\n\nEach ethnic group has their own traditional dances, with specific dances for different occasions. Some of these specific dances are meant for funerals, celebrations, storytelling, praise and worship. There are various dances in Ghana performed by the ten regions across the country, most frequently during festivals and occasions such as funerals, marriage ceremonies, etc. These dances are performed to entertain and educate people.( e.g. The 'Gome' dance, as performed by the Gas of the Greater Accra region of Ghana during the Homowo festival in August). Other dances in Ghana includes kpalongo performed by the Gas, Agbadza by the Ewes, Adowa by the Akans, Bambaya by the Northners, Patsa by the Ga-Adangbes, and many others.\n\nFunerals are libations are poured. African time is practiced. Sexuality is not discussed in Ghana.\n\nBlack magic belief is strong.\n\nThe cuisine has diverse traditional dishes from each ethnic group. Generally, most dishes consist of a starchy portion, and a sauce or soup, with fish, snails, meat or mushrooms.\n\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in the country. The national men's football team is known as the \"Black Stars\", with the under-20 team known as the \"Black Satellites\". The under-17 team is known as the \"Black Starlets\", while the national men's Olympic team are known as the \"Black Meteors\". They have participated in many championships including the African Cup of Nations, the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA U-20 World Cup.\n\nOn October 16, 2009, Ghana became the first African nation to win the FIFA U-20 World Cup by defeating Brazil 4-3 in a penalty shootout. On June 13, 2010, Ghana defeated Serbia 1-0 in first round play in the 2010 FIFA World Cup becoming the first African team to win a FIFA World Cup game hosted on African soil and subsequently became the only African team to progress from the group stage to the knock out phase at the 2010 event. On June 26, 2010 Ghana defeated the USA by 2 goals to 1 in their round of 16 match, becoming the third African country to reach the quarter final stage of the World Cup after Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002. A loss to Uruguay in Johannesburg on July 2, 2010 by penalty shoot-out ended Ghana's attempt at reaching the semi-finals of the competition.\n\nWhile men's football is most widely followed sport in Ghana, the national women's football team is gaining exposure, participating in the FIFA Women's World Cup and the CAF Women's Championship. The Ghana women's national football team is known as the \"Black Queens\", while the Ghana national women's under-20 football team are called the \"Black Princesses\".\n\nThere are several club football teams in Ghana, which play in the Ghana Premier League and Division One league, both managed by the Ghana Football Association. Notable among these are Accra Hearts of Oak SC and Asante Kotoko, which play at the premier league level and are the dominant contenders in the tournament.\n\nProminent football players recognized at the international level include Tony Yeboah, Michael Essien, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu, Abedi Pele, Asamoah Gyan, Anthony Annan, Quincy Owusu-Abeyie, John Pantsil, Samuel Osei Kuffour, Richard Kingson, Sulley Muntari, Laryea Kingston, Stephen Appiah, André Ayew, John Mensah and Dominic Adiyiah.\n\nGhana is also the birthplace of World Wrestling Entertainment Wrestler Kofi Kingston (born Kofi Sarkodie-Mensah), who is wrestling on the Smackdown brand. Also is Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong who competed in the Vancouver Winter Olympics.

{"id": "18889521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18889521", "title": "Dablot Prejjesne", "text": "Dablot Prejjesne\n\nDablot Prejjesne (also called Dablo) is a two-player strategy board game of the Sámi people, noted to have been played in the Lappland region of Sweden. Dablot Prejessne in Sámi actually means \"To play Dablo on a board\" . The game represents the struggle between nomadic Sami people and landowners.\n\nThe Sami people are represented in this game with one piece representing the Sami King (\"gånneka\"), one piece representing the Sami Prince (\"gånnekan alke\"), and 28 pieces representing their soldiers or warriors (\"dårake\"), . The landowners are represented with one piece representing the landowner, one piece representing the landowner's son, and 28 pieces representing their peasants. The game is a relative of draughts and Alquerque. Pieces leap over one another to capture. However, the similarities basically end there. In draughts and Alquerque, any piece can capture \"any\" enemy piece whether that enemy piece is a King or not. In Dablot Prejessne, pieces can only capture each other if they are of the same rank or lower. They cannot capture pieces of a higher rank. The Sami King and the landowner are the highest ranked pieces and are equal in rank, therefore, they can capture each other and all other pieces. The Sami Prince and the landowner's son are the second highest ranked pieces, and are of equal rank. The Sami Prince can not capture the landowner, and likewise, the landowner's son can not capture the Sami King. However, they can capture each other, and all the other pieces. The 28 soldiers or warriors and the 28 peasants are the lowest ranked pieces. The 28 soldiers or warriors can not capture the landowner or the landowner's son. Likewise, the 28 peasants cannot capture the Sami King or the Sami Prince. However, they can capture each other. All pieces do move alike, and can move and capture in any direction. There is no promotion of pieces in Dablot Prejjesne.\n\nIts closest relative in the draught family may be Italian checkers and Italian Damone. In all these games, a lower rank piece can not capture a higher rank piece. However, in Dablot Prejjesne ranks are pre-determined, and never change, whereas, in Italian checkers, pieces must be promoted to King in order to gain higher rank. In Italian Damone there are pre-determined ranked pieces also, however, it is played on an 8 x 8 draughts board with far less pieces as compared to Dablot Prejjesne.\n\nThe board used is very similar to that of Kharbaga. The difference is that in Kharbaga, the board is 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 whereas in Dablot Prejjesne, the board is 6 x 7.\n\nA player wins if it captures all their opponent's pieces. There are additional winning conditions common in variants; see the rules section below. A draw is possible by mutual agreement or after a number of turns made by each player without a capture.\n\nThe board used is a 6 (width) x 7 (length) grid board with diagonal lines running through each \"square\" of the board. Pieces are placed on the intersections between gridlines similar to Alquerque and its variants, instead of within the square spaces as in other draughts variants.\n\nEach player has 30 pieces total. One player traditionally plays the Sami tribe which can be the red or white colored pieces, and one player plays the landowner party which can be the black colored pieces.\n\nThe Sami tribe consist of 1 Sami King piece, 1 Sami Prince piece, and 28 soldiers or warriors (referred to as soldiers in this article). \n\nThe Landowner party consist of 1 Landowner piece, 1 Landowner's Son piece, and 28 peasants.\n\nFor simplicity, both sides' pieces can be referred to by the names of the Sami side (King, Prince and Soldiers), as the distinction between the names for each side's pieces has no significant in-game meaning. This article will however use the appropriate names for each side.\n\n1. Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first.\n\n2. The 28 soldiers or peasants are initially set up on each player's half of the board, on each intersection of the gridlines of the first 5 ranks (including the intersections of the diagonals in between the \"main\" orthogonal grid). The Sami Prince is placed on the sixth rank, on the intersection of diagonals to that player's farthest right. The Sami King is placed on the seventh rank, at the right edge of the board (please refer to the image above and the first external link below for a visual description of the initial setup for both Sami tribe and landowner party). Similarly, the Landowner's Son and Landowner are placed on that player's farthest right on the sixth and seventh rank, respectively.\n\n3. All pieces move alike. A piece moves one space along one of the gridlines to any adjacent, unoccupied intersection. All pieces can move forward or backward at any time. Only one piece may be moved per turn, or used to capture.\n\n4. Pieces may capture other pieces by jumping over them, similar to draughts. The piece must jump over a single adjacent opposing piece, and land on an unoccupied space on the exact opposite side of the jumped piece from its starting location. The jumped opposing piece is removed from play. A piece cannot jump over two opposing pieces in one jump, nor may it jump over a piece of its own color or jump over a piece into a space that is occupied (whether by that player or his opponent). A piece can make multiple jumps in one turn, even changing direction from one jump to the next, as long as the prior rules are followed.\n\n4a. As the original rules for Dablot Prejjesne are not completely known, it is unknown if capturing was originally compulsory. However, in modern play of the game, similar to other draughts variants, a player who has an available capture or chain of captures is required to make the capture(s). If the player has a choice regarding two or more pieces that can be used to capture, or between two or more \"paths\" for multiple captures by a single piece, the player may choose freely which piece to use or which sequence of captures to make, but cannot choose not to capture if one is possible.\n\n5. Pieces can only capture opposing pieces of equal or lower rank. The Sami King and Landowner are the highest ranked pieces and are of equal rank to one another, therefore, they can capture each other, and all the other pieces. The Sami Prince and the Landowner's Son are the second highest ranked pieces, and cannot capture the Sami King or Landowner; however, they can capture each other, and the other lower pieces. The Sami soldiers and peasants are the lowest ranked pieces. They can not capture the Sami King or Sami Prince, or the Landowner or Landowner's Son; however, they can capture each other. This is a primary difference between Dablot and most other draughts variants.\n\n6. There is no promotion of pieces in this game; a player cannot recover a captured King, Landowner, Prince or Son, or augment their numbers of these pieces.\n\nSome variants of this game include additional winning conditions which further speed the pace of the game, such as:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46194374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46194374", "title": "Deindustrialisation by country", "text": "Deindustrialisation by country\n\nDeindustrialisation refers to the process of social and economic change caused by the removal or reduction of industrial capacity or activity in a country or region, especially heavy industry or manufacturing industry. It is the opposite of industrialisation. Deindustrialisation has taken place in many nations over the years, as social changes and urbanisation have changed the financial demographics of the world. Phenomena such as the mechanisation of labour render industrial societies obsolete, and lead to the de-establishment of industrial communities.\n\nTheories that predict or explain deindustrialisation have a long intellectual lineage. Karl Marx's theory of declining (industrial) profit argues that technological innovation enables more efficient means of production, resulting in increased physical productivity, i.e., a greater output of use value per unit of capital invested. In parallel, however, technological innovations replace people with machinery, and the organic composition of capital increases. Assuming only labour can produce new additional value, this greater physical output embodies a smaller value and surplus value. The average rate of industrial profit therefore declines in the longer term.\n\nGeorge Reisman (2002) identified inflation as a contributor to deindustrialisation. In his analysis, the process of fiat money inflation distorts the economic calculations necessary to operate capital-intensive manufacturing enterprises, and makes the investments necessary for sustaining the operations of such enterprises unprofitable.\n\nThe term de-industrialisation crisis has been used to describe the decline of labour-intensive industry in a number of countries and the flight of jobs away from cities. One example is labour-intensive manufacturing. After free-trade agreements were instituted with less developed nations in the 1980s and 1990s, labour-intensive manufacturers relocated production facilities to Third World countries with much lower wages and lower standards. In addition, technological inventions that required less manual labour, such as industrial robots, eliminated many manufacturing jobs.\n\nOn 2008, four companies mass-produced cars in Australia. Mitsubishi ceased production in March 2008, followed by Ford in 2016, and Holden and Toyota in 2017.\n\nHolden bodyworks were manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia and engines are produced at the Fishermens Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. In 2006, Holden's export revenue was just under 1.3 billion. In March 2012, Holden was given a $270 million lifeline by the Australian government. In return, Holden planned to inject over $1 billion into car manufacturing in Australia. They estimated the new investment package would return around $4 billion to the Australian economy and see GM Holden continue making cars in Australia until at least 2022. However, Holden announced on 11 December 2013 that Holden cars would no longer be manufactured in Australia from the end of 2017.\n\nFord had two main factories, both in Victoria: located in the Geelong suburb of Norlane and the northern Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows. Both plants were closed down in October 2016.\n\nUntil 2006, Toyota had factories in Port Melbourne and Altona, Victoria. Since then, all manufacturing has been at Altona. In 2008, Toyota exported 101,668 vehicles worth $1,900 million. In 2011 the figures were \"59,949 units worth $1,004 million\". On 10 February 2014 it was announced that by the end of 2017 Toyota would cease manufacturing vehicles and engines in Australia.\n\nUntil trade liberalisation in the mid 1980s, Australia had a large textile industry. This decline continued through the first decade of the 21st century. Since the 1980s, tariffs have steadily been reduced; in early 2010, the tariffs were reduced from 17.5 percent to 10 percent on clothing, and 7.5–10% to 5% for footwear and other textiles.\nAs of 2010, most textile manufacturing, even by Australian companies, is performed in Asia.\n\nAustria has many indicators that justify labelling them as a deindustrialising country. Data collected from the OECD for Austria has shown that since 1956 total employment did grow until 1994 and since then remained relatively steady. Employment in industry and construction, however, has declined steadily as service sector employment has steadily increased. Data also shows that even as employment in industry and construction has decreased, industry productivity has continued to grow. \n\nAustrian unemployment has steadily increased since 1983 due to deindustrialisation. Austria was one of the countries in a study that showed that increasing overall unemployment was significantly related to manufacturing unemployment. Austria's foreign and domestic policy has made deindustrialisation possible. High labour taxes and high withholding taxes repel low-skill immigration as low capital taxes enable domestic capital investment. Stern banking secrecy policies, no withholding taxes for non-residents, joining the European Union, and adopting the Euro enabled substantial growth in Austria's services sector.\n\nData taken from the OECD website show that industrial employment in Belgium rose between 1999 and 2000 and then declined until 2003, rising again until 2006. The overall trend in industrial employment in Belgium, however, is still a decline. OECD data also shows that production and sales of total industry in Belgium has been on the rise since 1955, with the exception of small declines during a few years. Despite this trend, deindustrialisation is occurring at fairly rapid rates in Belgium. Variables such as large population increases and regional discrepancies account for these misleading statistics. Deindustrialisation is hitting the region of Wallonia much harder than the region of Flanders. Wallonia remains much more impoverished and has an unemployment rate of about 17% (twice that of the unemployment rate in Flanders). Other statistics displaying the effects of deindustrialisation in Belgium is the rise in employment in the service sector from 1999 until 2006. Today, industry is much less significant in Belgium than it has been in previous years.\n\nMuch of the academic literature pertaining to Canada hints at deindustrialisation as a problem in the older rust belt areas of Ontario and the east. Nationwide, over the past fifty years, according to 2008 OECD data, industrial production and overall employment have been steadily increasing. Industrial production levelled off a bit between 2004 and 2007, but its production levels are the highest that they have ever been. The perception of deindustrialisation that the literature refers to deals with the fact that although employment and economic production have risen, the economy has shifted drastically from manufacturing jobs to service sector jobs. Only 13% of the current Canadian population has a job in the industrial sector. Technological advancements in industry over the past fifty years have allowed for industrial production to keep rising during the Canadian economic shift to the service sector. 69% of the GDP of Canada comes from the service sector.\n\nRegarding Denmark's industry, the country does not appear to be deindustrialising as a whole. Literature (Goldsmith and Larsen 2004) has stated that perhaps Denmark's size and \"Nordic style\" of governing has allowed it to hide from the detrimental effects of globalisation. Both men's and women's labour statistics (OECD data 2008) show a steady increase over the past decade. Despite a slight dip from 2001 to 2003, overall employment in Denmark has been at a steady increase since 1995. Denmark's total industry output has also been on the rise since the 1974, despite an economic recession from 1987 to 1993. The country's high employment and low unemployment rates have improved the production industry, and the high tax rates have strengthened the economy.\n\nBased on the data from the OECD website, Finland has been industrialising according to industrial employment and industrial production statistics. Finland has been considered very resilient based on its remarkable economic comeback after their recession in 1990 due to the fall of the Soviet Union. During this time, production of total industry and civilian employment in industry declined rapidly. Finland has been ranked number one three times in the World Economic Forum competitiveness studies as one of the most developed IT economies since 2000. \n\nSince the 1990 recession, which was one of the largest in European history, Finland has managed to soar back to the top of the economic ladder. Finland has done so by focusing strongly on education. After their recession, Finland invested its money on boosting R&D, education, and retraining workers that had lost their job due to the recession. With its investment in education, Finland has succeeded in increasing some of its industries. For example, the forest industry now specialises in high-quality papers. As a result of investment in education and technology, Finland is now one of the world's largest producers of paper-making machinery. According to the statistics on the OECD website, Finland is not deindustrialising.\n\nData for France indicates that while employment in industry relative to the total French economy has decreased, there is a lack of sound evidence pointing to an overall trend of deindustrialisation. Research (Lee 2005, Feinstein 1999) shows that at the same time relative employment in industry is decreasing, total production in industry has almost quadrupled since the mid 20th century, levelling off only since about the year 2000 (OECD 2008). Lee shows that between 1962 and 1995, employment in industry in France fell 13.1% (2005:table 1). Advances in technology that allow for higher output by fewer employees, coupled with a change in the type of products manufactured domestically, such as the high-tech electronics now manufactured in France, explain the negative relationship of employment and output in French industry. Thus, it may feel like deindustrialisation is occurring because of the relative decrease of employment or highly publicised cases of outsourcing, yet the data suggest industry production in France is not suffering.\n\nIn occupied Germany after World War II the Morgenthau Plan was implemented, although not in its most extreme version. The plan was present in the U.S. occupation directive JCS 1067 and in the Allied \"industrial disarmament\" plans. On February 2, 1946, a dispatch from Berlin reported:\nAccording to some historians, the U.S. government abandoned the Morgenthau plan as policy in September 1946 with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes' speech \"Restatement of Policy on Germany\".\n\nOthers have argued that credit should be given to former U.S. President Herbert Hoover, who in one of his reports from Germany, dated March 18, 1947, argued for a change in occupation policy, amongst other things stating, \"There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a 'pastoral state'. It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move 25,000,000 people out of it.\"\n\nWorries about the sluggish recovery of the European economy, which before the war had depended on the German industrial base, and growing Soviet influence amongst a German population subject to food shortages and economic misery, caused the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Generals Clay and Marshall to start lobbying the Truman administration for a change of policy.\n\nIn July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on \"national security grounds\" the punitive occupation directive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to \"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy\". It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead noted that \"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\"\n\nIt had taken over two months for General Clay to overcome continued resistance to the new directive JCS 1779, but on July 10, 1947, it was finally approved at a meeting of the SWNCC. The final version of the document \"was purged of the most important elements of the Morgenthau plan.\"\n\nDismantling of (West) German industry ended in 1951, but \"industrial disarmament\" lingered in restrictions on actual German steel production, and production capacity, as well as in restrictions on key industries. All remaining restrictions were finally rescinded on May 5, 1955. \"The last act of the Morgenthau drama occurred on that date or when the Saar was returned to Germany.\"\n\nVladimir Petrov concluded: \"The victorious Allies … delayed by several years the economic reconstruction of the war torn continent, a reconstruction which subsequently cost the US billions of dollars.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s, the unemployment in Germany was moderately high, while industrial output was steadily increasing. Germany's unemployment rate of roughly seven percent (OECD, 2008) is by and large due to the continuing struggles with the reunification process between East and West Germany that began in 1990. However, the unemployment rate has been declining since 2005, when it reached its peak of over ten percent. In the 2010s, Germany's unemployment rate has been one of the lowest in continental Europe.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2017 the manufacturing employment in absolute terms has risen by 10% from 4.9 million workers to 5.4 million December 2016. Federal German statistics office\n\nDuring the reign of the Mughal Empire, India was the largest economy on Earth, accounting for roughly one-quarter of the world economy. It had strong agriculture and industry, and was the world's largest cotton textile manufacturer (particularly Bengal). But in the latter half of the 18th century, India underwent political turmoil and Europeans (mainly British) got an opportunity to become political masters. During their rule, British mercantilism targeted weakening of the craft guilds, pricing and quota caps, and banning production of many products and commodities in India.\n\nIndia's de-industrialization contributed to Britain's Industrial Revolution, with India no longer being a competitor in the global textile industry, as well as India itself becoming a large market for British textiles. Britain eventually replaced India as the world's largest cotton textile manufacturer in the 19th century.\n\nIreland has yet to de-industrialise. Industrial employment and production and sales in industry have increased since 1990, according to OECD data. The increase in industry coincided with the introduction of Intel to the Irish economy in late 1989. Though one may not think of Intel as industry in the same sense as steel production, it is considered to be industry. Intel is now the largest company by turnover in Ireland. This was the beginning of what was called the \"Celtic Tiger\" economy. Dell and Microsoft followed Intel to Ireland, creating a large software industry. As is evidenced by these three companies, a majority of the industries that exist in Ireland are a result of foreign direct investment. The top three FDIs are the US, the UK, and Germany.\n\nOverall, Italy in 2008 did not seem to be deindustrialising. According to OECD (2008) data, the rate of industrial employment is at an all-time high, although, in general, it has stayed relatively consistent since 1956. The rate of industrial production is also on the rise after a small dip in recent years; even though production rates are still at almost 2 percent less than they were in 2000, the 2005 rate is eighty percent more than what it was in 1955. These figures, however, do not make the distinction between different regions of the country: according to Rowthorn and Ramaswamy (1999), most manufacturing plants are located in cities such as Genoa and Milan in Northern Italy, and the unemployment rate in the South is significantly higher than in the North. Prior to World War II, Italy's economy was mainly agricultural, but it has since shifted to become one of the largest industrial economies in the world. In general, Italy is continuing to experience a period of industrialisation that has been taking place since the shift.\n\nTo further remove Japan as a potential future military threat after World War II, the Far Eastern Commission decided that Japan must partly be de-industrialised. Dismantling of Japanese industry was foreseen to have been achieved when Japanese standards of living were reduced to those between 1930 and 1934 (see Great Depression). In the end the adopted program of de-industrialisation in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar U.S. \"industrial disarmament\" program in Germany.\n\nA notable event began in the 1990s as the economy of Japan suddenly stagnated after three decades of tremendous economic growth. This could be construed as directly linked to deindustrialisation, as this phenomenon began to be recognised in developed countries of the world around this same time. However, Japan had larger economic problems, the effects of which can still be seen in the country's low economic growth today. According to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2008), deindustrialisation is occurring in Japan. However, although industrial employment as a percentage of total employment has dropped over the last couple of decades in Japan, total employment has not. Unemployment was fairly low at 3.5% in 2007, and the economy is relatively stable. Literature (Matsumoto 1996) has stated that the service sector has been expanding and providing jobs for those that have been displaced from industry. Strong union membership has also played a role in keeping employment rates stable. Although outsourcing and industrial decline may contribute to job loss in industry, the shift in modern economies from industry to service may help reduce negative effects.\n\nMuch like many other OECD countries, the Netherlands is not experiencing deindustrialisation in the usual way one might think of it. While the OECD's Annual Labour Force Statistics Survey may show that industrial employment opportunities in the Netherlands have significantly decreased in the past 50 years, the OECD's Production and Sales MEI for Industry and Service Statistics shows that the overall production in the industrial sector has actually improved. The Netherlands, like many other countries, has advanced to produce more with less.\n\nAlso, perhaps in response to the decline in industrial sector employment, the service industry of the Netherlands has grown and expanded its employment opportunities. The timely response of alternatives for employment may have had something to do with the progressive policies the Netherlands has in place to complement the changes in industry. An example might include tax breaks for families where the father works full-time and the mother works part-time, also referred to as the \"one-and-a-half breadwinner\" policy.\n\nNew Zealand is in a phase of deindustrialisation starting in the late 1990s. The evidence for this phenomenon is apparent in the decrease of economic output, a shift from employment in the manufacturing sector to the service sector (which may be due to an increase in tourism), the dissipation of unions caused by immigration and individual work contracts, along with the influence on culture by highbrow mass media (like the internet) and technology. It is possible to interpret these trends in a different way due to the complex nature of the data and the difficulty in quantifying and calculating reliable results. These trends are important to study, because they might occur in waves that could help predict economic and cultural outcomes in the future.\n\nWith the reduction and removal of tariffs through the 1980s and 1990s plus the importation of second hand Japanese cars, the major assembly plants began to close. New Zealand Motor Corporation which had closed its aging Newmarket plant in 1976 and Petone plant in 1982 closed their Panmure plant in 1988. General Motors closed its Petone plant in 1984 and its Trentham plant in 1990. 1987 saw a run of closures: Motor Industries International, Otahuhu, Ford Seaview, Motor Holdings Waitara. Suzuki in Wanganui closed 1988 and VANZ (Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand a joint Ford and Mazda operation) at Sylvia Park in 1997. Toyota Christchurch in 1996 and VANZ Wiri the next year. Finally in 1998 along with Mitsubishi Porirua, bought from Todd in 1987, Nissan shutdown at Wiri, Honda closed in Nelson and Toyota in Thames. \n\nRedundancies occurred in manufacturing industry; approximately 76,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 1987 and 1992.\n\nIn Poland, as in many other former communist countries, deindustrialisation occurred rapidly in the years after the fall of communism in 1989, with many unprofitable industries going bankrupt with the switch to market economy, and other state-owned industries being destroyed by a variety of means, including arbitrarily changed credit and tax policies. The deindustrialisation in Poland was based on a neoliberalism-inspired doctrine (systemic transformation according to the requirements of Western financial institutions) and on the conviction that industry-based economy was a thing of the past. However, the extent of deindustrialisation was greater in Poland than in other European, including post-communist, countries: more than ⅓ of total large and midsize industrial assets were eliminated. The perceived economic reasons for deindustrialisation were reinforced by political and ideological motivations, such as removal of the remaining socialist influences concentrated in large enterprises (opposed to rapid privatization and shock therapy, as prescribed by the Balcerowicz Plan) and by land speculation (plants were sold at prices even lower than the value of the land on which they were located). Among such \"privatized\" institutions there were many cases of hostile takeovers (involved in 23% of all assets transferred), when industrial entities were sold and then changed to the service sector or liquidated to facilitate a takeover of the old company's market by the buying (typically foreign) firm.\n\nAccording to comprehensive research data compiled by economist Andrzej Karpiński and others, 25-30% of the reductions were economically justified, while the rest resulted from various processes that were controversial, often erroneous or pathological, including actions aimed at quick self-enrichment on the part of people with decision-making capacities. Unlike in the case of the Western deindustrialisation of the preceding years, in Poland modern competitive industries with established markets were also eliminated, including the electronic, telecommunications, computer, industrial machinery, armament and chemical industries. The abandoned domestic and foreign markets, often in Eastern Europe and the Third World countries, had subsequently been taken over by non-Polish interests. Nearly half (47%) of the lost enterprises represented consumer product light industry, rather than heavy industry. Capitalist Poland's early economic policies resulted in economic and social crises including high unemployment, and in what some see as irredeemable losses, impacting Poland's situation today. At the same time however, many constructive developments took place, including the widespread rise of entrepreneurship, and, especially after Poland joined the European Union, significant economic growth. The transformation process, as executed, generally replaced large enterprises with small, creating an environment inimical to innovation but conducive to human capital flight.\n\nThe evaluation of Poland's economic advancement depends on the criteria used. For example, the country's industrial output had increased 2.4 times between 1989 and 2015, while the Polish GDP's percentage of the gross world product dropped from 2.4 in 1980 to 0.5-0.6 in 2015. In a number of measured categories of progress, Poland places behind its European Union formerly communist near neighbors (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania), which had not undertaken deindustrialisation policies as radical as that of Poland.\n\nPrior to its dissolution in 1991, the USSR had the second largest economy in the world after the United States. The economy of the Soviet Union was the modern world's first centrally planned economy. It was based on a system of state ownership and managed through Gosplan (the State Planning Commission), Gosbank (the State Bank) and Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Economic planning was through a series of five-year plans. The emphasis was put on rapid development of heavy industry, and the nation became one of the world's top manufacturers of a large number of basic and heavy industrial products, but it lagged behind in the output of light industrial production and consumer durables.\n\nAs the Soviet economy grew more complex, it required more and more complex disaggregation of control figures (plan targets) and factory inputs. As it required more communication between the enterprises and the planning ministries, and as the number of enterprises, trusts, and ministries multiplied, the Soviet economy started stagnating. The Soviet economy was increasingly sluggish when it came to responding to change, adapting cost−saving technologies, and providing incentives at all levels to improve growth, productivity and efficiency.\n\nMost information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down, and economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information, particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers. As a result, some goods tended to be underproduced, leading to shortages, while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage. Some factories developed a system of barter and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts, while consumers developed a black market for goods that were particularly sought after but constantly underproduced.\n\nConceding the weaknesses of their past approaches in solving new problems, the leaders of the late 1980s, headed by Mikhail Gorbachev, were seeking to mold a program of economic reform to galvanise the economy. However, by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue.\n\nThe industrial production system in the Soviet Union suffered a political and economic collapse in 1991, after which a transition from centrally planned to market-driven economies occurred. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic integration of the Soviet republics was dissolved, and overall industrial activity declined substantially. A lasting legacy remains in the physical infrastructure created during decades of combined industrial production practices.\n\nSweden's industrial sector presents diverging information in production output and industrial employment levels. Using OECD (2008) data, specific statements can be made about these elements. With this data, it can be seen that production output within the industrial sector has been constantly rising. Contrastingly, employment within industry has been steadily declining since the 1970s, as service sector employment rates increase. Though the decline in industrial employment points to a deindustrialising economy, the increasing levels of production output state otherwise.\n\nSweden's industrial sector remains intact as it relies on its resource base of timber, hydropower, and iron ore as a large economic contributor. Because of its increased production rates in industry, it can be ascertained that deindustrialisation has not occurred in Sweden. The decrease in industrial employment has been countered by an increase in efficiency and automation, increasing output levels in the industrial sector.\n\nDeindustrialisation is a phenomenon that has been occurring in Switzerland since the mid-1970s. Civilian employment in industry has been in decline since 1975, according to OECD (2008) data, due to a major recession in the market. Literature (Afonso 2005) has stated that this is due to large numbers of migrant workers being forced to leave the country thanks to nonrenewable working permits; the industry, heavily based in foreign labour, suffered greatly and those losses are still observed in the present. Production of total industry has been increasing consistently at a slow rate since a slight decline in 1974.\n\nThe United Kingdom has experienced deindustrialisation, especially in both heavy industry (such as mining and steel) and light manufacturing. New jobs have appeared with either low wages, or with high skill requirements that the laid-off workers lack. Meanwhile, the political reverberations have been growing.\n\nThe UK's share of manufacturing output had risen from 9.5% in 1830, during the Industrial Revolution, to 22.9% in the 1870s. It fell to 13.6% by 1913, 10.7% by 1938, and 4.9% by 1973. Overseas competition, lack of innovation, trade unionism, the welfare state, loss of the British Empire, and cultural attitudes have all been put forward as explanations for the industrial decline. It reached crisis point in the 1970s, with a worldwide energy crisis, high inflation, and a dramatic influx of low-cost manufactured goods from Asia. Coal mining quickly collapsed and practically disappeared by the 21st century. Railways were decrepit, more textile mills closed than opened, steel employment fell sharply, and the car-making industry suffered. Popular responses varied a great deal; Tim Strangleman \"et al.\" found a range of responses from the affected workers: some nostalgically invoked a glorious industrial past or the bygone empire to cope with their new-found personal economic insecurity, many turned to exclusionary Englishness, and others looked to the European Union for help. By the 2010s, grievances had accumulated enough to have a political impact: the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) gained an increasing share of the vote in working-class towns while warning against the dangers of immigration. Political reverberations came to a head in the popular vote in favour of Brexit in 2016.\n\nIn the United States, deindustrialisation is mostly a regional phenomenon, centred on the Rust Belt of the original industrial centres from New England to the Great Lakes. While many Americans put the timing of industrial crisis as 1979 to 1984, in fact the most massive loss of US manufacturing jobs occurred in the 21st century: one third of US manufacturing jobs disappeared between 2001 and 2009, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3000000001.\n\nThe mainstream of the economics professions argues nonetheless that loss of manufacturing jobs is not a problem for the following reasons: real industrial production rose in the United States in most years from 1983 to 2007. The argument is then that machines are replacing workers in the sense that more output is being produced by the same number of workers. In addition, the overall US labour force has increased dramatically, resulting in a massive reduction in the percent of the labour force engaged in industry (from over 35% in the late 1960s to under 20% today). Industry (and specifically manufacturing) is thus less prominent in American life and the American economy now than in over a hundred years.\n\nHowever, the interpretation that manufacturing employment declined as a result of replacing people with machines has not addressed the issue that US non-financial firms seriously dropped their investment in fixed capital as a percent of operating profits between 2001 and 2009 (see NIPA accounts at www.bea.gov). It appears that far from buying robots, US manufacturing firms may be buying fewer machines as well as hiring fewer workers. In general, the literature that argues loss of US manufacturing jobs is inevitable in an advanced capitalist nation does also not grapple with the prominent role of manufacturing in advanced economies such as Germany and Japan, which also tend to have unit labor costs at least as high (if not higher) than those of the United States, per the Conference Board.\n\nIn fact, industry does continue in the United States, for example, there are export-competitive producers of precision technology in New England. Thus, the perception that all industry has left the United States is due to shifting patterns in the geography and political geography of production, away from metropolitan centers (such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Oakland, toward more \"rural\" areas (such as Georgia or New Hampshire or Utah). Since most Americans live in large cities, most Americans see empty factories, even if plants are operating well in other locations. Some argue also that the shift has been (from the heavily unionised Northeast and Midwest towards the Southeast and the high supply of workers (largely immigrant, first-generation, and second-generation) willing to accept low wages in the Southwest), along with increasing labour productivity, which has led to higher levels of output without increases in the total number of workers. Many argue that the textile industry, was the dominant factor in the industrialisation of New England, and in the 20th century increasingly textile factories were moved to the South. In recent decades the South has also lost its textile firms.\n\nYet it would be inaccurate to argue that the only sectors to leave New England after 1980 were labor-intensive sector such as shoes and textiles, and there are many non-union firms in New England today. Rather, even high productivity sectors in which the US might be expected to have a comparative advantage such as machine tool production departed the United States between 1980 and 1985. This is arguably because the US Federal Reserve advocated for a strong dollar policy, at precisely the moment when German and Japanese manufacturers had falling costs due to rising productivity (post WW II catch-up was complete). Under the circumstances of falling Japanese prices, for example, only a decline in the value of the US dollar could have kept US machine tools competitive. The fact that the US Federal Reserve followed precisely the opposite policy and caused the dollar to appreciate 1979 to 1984 was a death blow to New England's machine tools. In 1986, the Fed recognized its mistake and negotiated the devaluation of the dollar against the Yen and the German Mark with the Plaza Accords, but by then it was too late for many firms, which either closed, laid off hundreds, or were sold to conglomerates during the down periods.\n\nCertain sectors of manufacturing remain vibrant. The production of electronic equipment has risen by over 50%, while that of clothing has fallen by over 60%. Following a moderate downturn, industrial production grew slowly but steadily between 2003 and 2007. The sector, however, averaged less than 1% growth annually from 2000 to 2007; from early 2008, moreover, industrial production again declined, and by June 2009, had fallen by over 15% (the sharpest decline since the great depression). Output thereafter began to recover.\n\nThe population of the United States has nearly doubled since the 1950s, adding approximately 150 million people. Yet, during this period (1950–2007), the proportion of the population living in the great manufacturing cities of the Northeast has declined significantly. During the 1950s, the nation's twenty largest cities held nearly a fifth of the US population. In 2006, this proportion has dropped to about one tenth of the population.\nMany small and mid-sized manufacturing cities in the Rust Belt experience similar fates. For instance, the city of Cumberland, Maryland, declined from a population of 39,483 in the 1940s to a population of 20,915 in 2005. The city of Detroit, Michigan, saw its population drop from a peak of 1,849,568 in 1950 to 713,777 in 2010, the largest drop in population of any major city in the U.S. (1,135,971) and the second largest drop in terms of percent of people lost (second only to St. Louis, Missouri's 62.7% drop).\n\nOne of the first industries to decline was the textile industry in New England, as its factories shifted to the South. Since the 1970s, textiles have also declined in the Southeast. New England responded by developing a high-tech economy, especially in education and medicine, using its very strong educational base.\n\nAs Americans migrated away from the manufacturing centres, they formed sprawling suburbs, and many former small cities have grown tremendously in the last 50 years. In 2005 alone, Phoenix, Arizona has grown by 43,000 people, an increase in population greater than any other city in the United States. Contrast that with the fact that in 1950, Phoenix was only the 99th largest city in the nation with a population of 107,000. In 2005, the population has grown to 1.5 million, ranking as the sixth largest city proper in the US.\n\n\n\n"}

She left her friend at midnight and was about to travel home to Riihimäki. She walked to the train station and left waiting for the train on the pier, when she was soon followed by a dark-haired man dressed in a leather jacket. The man asked about her travel plans, and she told him that she was expecting to catch a train to Riihimäki. The man offered Meriläinen a ride home, and because she was under the influence of alcohol, she agreed. He then walked her to his car, which Meriläinen later stated in the interrogations was a light-coloured passenger car, not a station wagon, probably an elder Mazda or Datsun.\n\nAt the start of the trip, the man offered alcoholic beverages and some form of medicine in the form of capsules, to which Meriläinen accepted both. The man himself took several of the capsules during the drive. During the trip, she noticed that the man seemed distressed and that he had a child seat at the back. She fell asleep, and when she woke up, Meriläinen noticed that the car was not on the road to Riihimäki, but on a remote forest path. When she asked the man about the route, he assured her that he was still on the right way.\n\nThe man drove the car to a dark gravel pit and stopped the car. He tried to persuade Meriläinen to stay in the car for a night, but she refused and said that she wanted to go home. At that point, the man said that he needed to go urinate and left the car, with Meriläinen feeling the same need and also leaving the car. When Meriläinen squatted, the man quickly approached and struck her to head with the edge of a knife. Despite the injury, Meriläinen managed to flee towards the forest.\n\nShe heard the man say \"I did not succeed this time\". When she started running, the man spoke something to himself and entered his car. After a while, Meriläinen found a road to a house and alerted them for help. An ambulance was called, and she got away with minor physical injuries. She was apparently saved by a thick woollen knit cap.\n\nIn April 1991, 28-year-old Tuula Lukkarinen left Kellokoski psychiatric hospital on vacation, with the purpose of travelling to Hyrylä for a custody case for her son. However, she never made it to Hyrylä, and was last seen in Järvenpää waiting on a liquor store to open before ten o'clock am. \n\nThe next day, a landowner discovered her badly mutilated body in the woods near a gravel pit, the body being less than 100 metres away from the place where, a five months earlier, Meriläinen was attacked. According to police, Lukkarinen was transported to Hausjärvi between the day of disappearance and the day of discovery and the time of death had been around midnight. The body had been dragged a few dozen meters to the woods from a small road that led to the gravel pits. A blizzard had hit the area during the hours after her death and caused damage to the crime scene. \n\nAccording to police Lukkarinen was not raped.\n\n40-year-old Maarit Haantie disappeared in August 1993, and is also suspected of being the victim of a possible serial killer. Her body was searched for by the local authorities to no avail. The NBI began investigating the cases of the three women as the doing of one killer, arguing that many factors, such as the use of alcohol, the dark hair color and being in the same area contributed to the theory. According to NBI they also have information that connects the disappearance to the two earlier cases that they won't publish due to an open investigation. \n\nHaantie was attending a party at the restaurant Zapata in Järvenpää on August 13, 1993. She was going there with her partner and a few friends. All of them got in the restaurant except Haantie. Haantie was not let in by the doorman because of her drunkenness. She was last seen standing outside the building, and hasn't been seen since.\n\nThe disappearance of Haantie was initially filed to the Riihimäki Police, who treated the case as a normal disappearance without any indication of homicide. Soon, however, it was discovered that a bag belonging to Haantie had been found in a restaurant called Martina at the town of Hyvinkää. During interviews with the staff, it was apparent that the employees had removed a drunk person who resembled Maarit Haantie. \n\nIt soon became clear that in 1991, a woman by the name of Tuula Lukkarinen had been found brutally murdered in a Hausjärvi gravel pit. Earlier, in 1990, Helena Meriläinen was attacked in the same area where Lukkarinen's body was discovered five months later. Helena had been hit with a knife, but managed to escape. The police assumed that Meriläinen had been attacked by the same man who had killed Tuula Lukkarinen.\n\nThe whole chain of events mentioned above drew the attention of the NBI, and soon the case of Haantie was included in the investigation. A large search was carried out in the woods around the Hausjärvi municipality and especially the gravel pits area south of Hikiä village, but nothing was found. The investigation, however, has remained active to this day. In 2007, the television series \"\"Kadonneet\", \"Disappeared\"\" did an episode on Haantie's case, which attracted a lot of attention. In the section, the NBI specifically asked for a hint about a dark-haired man in Järvenpää in the early 90s who offered rides to women, as described by Helena Meriläinen. \n\nTuula Lukkarinen, Helena Meriläinen and Maarit Haantie were combined the use of alcohol, dark hair and living environment, with the NBI believing that the same perpetrator is responsible for all three cases. The \"Kadonneet \"episode gathered about 30 new tips, which helped with the offender's profiling. \n\nAccording to the NBI, the hints have been very important for the investigation, and have confirmed the results of earlier profiling. Investigation is still active, and the Bureau strongly believes that there have been other murder attempts.\n\nThe NBI has searched for Haantie from the forrest areas in Hausjärvi as late as in 2017, claiming that they have information that connects Haantie to the area.\n\nIn 2017 it was published in the media that there had been a possible fourth case involving the murders. In 1989 a 30-year-old drunken woman had just exited a restaurant in Järvenpää when a man offered her a ride, offering her alcohol and pills and then driving her to a nearby forest, the case resembling the case of Helena Meriläinen's. Although the woman did make it, the victim's mother brought it up after the woman had died of natural causes years later.\n\nIn year 1988 there were several cases of a man with a similar description and driving a white Volkswagen Passat liftback harassing women in the areas close by and even attempting to abduct a 19 year old woman in Hämeenlinna by threatening her with a pistol while the woman was able to escape from a moving car.\n\nIn the december of 1987 a 19 year old woman Heidi Härö went missing in Mäntsälä after leaving a local bar and hitching a ride. Her decomposed body was found five months later from a forrest area in Pukkila with some of her clothes missing.\n\nOver the years, the perpetrator has been profiled largely based on Meriläinen's story and events, with the description as following:\n\n\nA lot of new tips about the killer have been provided due to the \"Kadonneet \"episode. According to some, a dark-haired man is believed to have offered rides to a few women still in the 21st century. According to the tips a man fitting to the description has last been offering a ride to a woman in year 2006. The NBI is still investigating the case, believing that the killer can be found. They have also taken into account that the killer hasn't been found yet because he might be living abroad or is dead.\n\n"}

He is the author of \"Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America\", published in 2017 and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction, and a co-founder of the Maya Angelou School in Washington, D.C.\n\nForman is the son of James Forman Sr. and Constancia Romilly, who met through their activism and involvement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC. Forman Sr. was the group's executive secretary handling internal operations from 1961 to 1966 and active during the 1964 Freedom Summer. Romilly, daughter of the British journalist and aristocrat Jessica Mitford, dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College to join the group in 1962 and would eventually become a coordinator of SNCC's Atlanta chapter. Forman has a brother, Chaka Forman.\n\nForman Sr. and Romilly divorced in the early 1970s when Forman was seven years old. Forman speculated in an interview that FBI pressure on civil rights groups at the time contributed to the strain on his parents' marriage: \"There was also the period when...the FBI was putting incredible pressure on civil rights groups through the counter-intelligence program -- or the COINTELPRO program. And they were fomenting lies and distrust... They [Forman Sr. and Romilly] had a hard time in those years for a lot of reasons but I know, for my mom in particular, that that was one.\"\n\nAfter his parents' divorce, Forman and his brother lived with Romilly in New York but spent summers and holidays with Forman Sr., and Forman has stated that both parents were active in his life.\n\nForman was accepted into an elite New York high school: Hunter College High School. The school was almost all white, prompting Romilly to move with her sons to Atlanta so they could grow up in a black community, which she considered important for their racial identities. Forman expressed the importance of this move in an interview, saying: \"In a city that has so many African-American people, I would go to school, and the jocks were black. The nerds were black... The artsy kids were black. The band-camp kids were black. The thugs were black -- like, everybody was black. So there wasn't a way to perform that went along with being black. And that, I think, was very powerful and liberating for me as a child because it meant I got to be who I was, which was a nerdy kid. And nobody thought, oh, well, you're not black if you're reading books.\"\n\nForman attended Roosevelt High School in Atlanta. He went on to attend Brown University, from which he received his Bachelor of Arts in 1988. He received a Doctor of Law degree from Yale Law School in 1992.\n\nIn the 1990s, right after graduating law school, Forman began work as a law clerk for William Norris of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The next year he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\nForman describes working with O'Connor as enjoyable, although they disagreed on many of the social issues that came before the court. In his interview for the job, Forman was asked how his differing political viewpoints would affect his work as a law clerk. In an interview, he stated his response: \"I told her that I will argue with you. I'll tell you the truth about what I think. I will try to persuade you. But at the end of the day, you are the justice, and I'm the law clerk. And if I'm taking this job, I'm agreeing to help you do your work, right? I'm helping -- if you decide to come out the other way and assign me the opinion, then I'll write the best opinion I can for you.\"\n\nDuring his stint as her law clerk, Forman was encouraged by O'Connor to pursue a career in the Department of Justice or with a civil rights organization such as the NAACP. He instead opted to become a public defender, saying in an interview, \"I imagined myself doing the civil rights work of my generation.\"\n\nForman became a public defender in Washington, D.C. in the fall of 1994, a job he would hold for six years. He wrote about some of his experiences with clients in \"Locking Up Our Own.\"\n\nIn 2003, Forman began teaching law at Georgetown University. He remained at Georgetown until 2011, when he joined the faculty at Yale. There he teaches Constitutional Law and seminars entitled Race, Class and Punishment and another entitled Inside Out: Issues in Criminal Justice.\n\nIn 1997, Forman cofounded with David Domenici as part of the See Forever Foundation, a comprehensive educational program for teens, which later became the Maya Angelou Public Charter School. Domenici, a Stanford Law graduate and former corporate attorney first pitched his idea for the school to Forman in a D.C. coffee shop in 1995, and they began planning in earnest soon after.\n\nThe school was designed to reach troubled children and provide them high-quality education, counseling services, and employment opportunities. Forman thought the program could be incredibly beneficial to some of his clients as a public defender; he wrote in his book: \"Most of my clients had struggled in school or dropped out altogether before they were arrested. If a program like [this one] had existed…they might never have become my clients in the first place.\"\n\nIn 1997, Forman took a leave of absence from public defense work to pursue opening the Maya Angelou School. In the fall, with some grant money and teachers hired on, the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School opened with twenty students selected from the court system, all of them either on probation or committed to the Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services. The students had poor academic records and had often experienced trauma or struggled with mental health. In addition, Forman writes in \"Locking Up Our Own\" about ongoing struggles with local police targeting students of the school for searches and arrests.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the school was successful. By September 2004, the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School had grown significantly and opened a second campus location in partnership with the District of Columbia Public Schools.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the Maya Angelou School took over the school inside Oak Hill Detention Center, Washington D.C.'s juvenile prison. The changes enacted by the Maya Angelou School inside the prison were described by a court monitor as contributing to an \"extraordinary\" turnaround. The same year, the Transition Center was also opened to help young people transition from incarceration by helping them get GEDs and workplace credentials.\n\nToday the Maya Angelou School system includes the Maya Angelou Public Charter High School, the Maya Angelou Young Adult Learning Center (the Transition Center), and the Maya Angelou Academy at New Beginnings.\n\nThe Maya Angelou School's mission statement, described as \"the Maya Way\" on the school's website, is to provide \"a comprehensive approach to education that focuses on academic achievement, social and emotional support, and career and college preparation so students are ready for life after Maya.\"\n\nThe school's name was chosen in a contest from an essay written by Sherti Hendrix, a member of the class of 1999, the school's first graduating class.\n\nForman was part of the 1999 documentary \"Innocent Until Proven Guilty\", which focused on his work as a public defender and with the See Forever Foundation.\n\nForman has contributed writing about topics such as police brutality, mass incarceration, and the criminal justice system to \"The Atlantic\" and \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn April 2017, Forman published his first book, \"Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America\". The book examines tough on crime policies that were supported in many black communities in the 1970s but are now contributing to mass incarceration. In an interview, Forman stated about the issues addressed in the book: \"When we think about our criminal justice system, I don't think we can imagine choices in isolation... And so what I'm trying to argue in the book is that we have to look at this system as a whole, and we have to look at all of its dysfunctions. And only until we do that will we really understand the damage that it's doing to people's lives. Sometimes, some people even say we need more prisons. But they also say, we need more job training. We need more housing. We need better schools. We need funding for drug treatment, for mental health treatment. We need a national gun control policy. We need a Marshall Plan for urban America. We need the federal government to do for black communities what is did for Europe after World War II -- to rebuild, to reinvest, to revitalize. That's the claim. But instead of all of the above, the black community, historically, has gotten one of the above. And the one of the above is law enforcement.\"\n\n\"Locking Up Our Own\" was included on accolade lists such as the \"Publishers Weekly\" Best Books of 2017, the \"New York Times Book Review\" Editors' Choice, the \"GQ\" Book of the Year as well was the longlist for the National Book Awards and the shortlist for the Inaugural Goddard Riverside Stephan Russo Book Prize for Social Justice.\n\n"}

{"id": "163456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163456", "title": "Last Tango in Paris", "text": "Last Tango in Paris\n\nLast Tango in Paris () is a 1972 Italian-French erotic drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci which portrays a recently widowed American who begins an anonymous sexual relationship with a young Parisian woman. It stars Marlon Brando, Maria Schneider, and Jean-Pierre Léaud.\n\nThe film's raw portrayal of sexual violence and emotional turmoil led to international controversy and drew various levels of government censorship in different venues. Upon release in the United States, the most graphic scene was cut and the MPAA gave the film an X rating. After revisions were made to the MPAA ratings code, in 1997 the film was re-classified NC-17 for \"some explicit sexual content\". Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released a censored R-rated cut in 1981.\n\nPaul (Marlon Brando), a middle-aged American hotel owner mourning his wife's suicide, meets a young, engaged Parisian woman named Jeanne (Maria Schneider) at an apartment that both are interested in renting. Paul takes the apartment after they begin an anonymous sexual relationship there. He insists that neither of them must share any personal information, even given names. The affair continues until one day, Jeanne arrives at the apartment and finds that Paul has packed up and left without warning.\n\nPaul later meets Jeanne on the street and says he wants to renew the relationship. He tells her of the recent tragedy of his wife. As he tells his life story, they walk into a tango bar, where he continues telling her about himself. The loss of anonymity disillusions Jeanne about their relationship. She tells Paul she does not want to see him again. Paul, not wanting to let Jeanne go, chases her back to her apartment, where he tells her he loves her and wants to know her name.\n\nJeanne takes a gun from a drawer. She tells Paul her name and shoots him. Paul staggers out onto the balcony, mortally wounded, and collapses. As Paul dies, a dazed Jeanne mutters to herself that he was just a stranger who tried to rape her and she did not know who he was, as if in a rehearsal, preparing herself for questioning by the police.\n\nBernardo Bertolucci developed the film from his sexual fantasies: \"He once dreamed of seeing a beautiful nameless woman on the street and having sex with her without ever knowing who she was\". The screenplay was by Bertolucci, Franco Arcalli, and Agnès Varda (additional dialogue). It was later adapted as a novel by Robert Alley. The film was directed by Bertolucci with cinematography by Vittorio Storaro.\n\nBertolucci originally intended to cast Dominique Sanda, who developed the idea with him, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Trintignant refused and, when Brando accepted, Sanda was pregnant and decided not to do the film.\n\nAn art lover, Bertolucci drew inspiration from the works of the Irish-born British artist Francis Bacon for the opening sequence of cast and crew credits. According to American artist Andy Warhol, the \"Last Tango\" film was based on Warhol's own \"Blue Movie\" film released a few years earlier in 1969.\n\nAfter the film's release, criminal proceedings were brought in Italy against the film for \"esasperato pansessualismo fine a se stesso\"(\"aggravated, gratuitous pansexualism\"). The final judgment of the Court of Appeal (Cassazione) delivered on 29 January 1976 ordered that the film be seized by the censorship commission and that all copies be destroyed. Scriptwriter Franco Arcalli, producer Alberto Grimaldi, director Bernardo Bertolucci, and Marlon Brando were each given suspended sentences of two months imprisonment.\n\nThe film contains a scene in which Brando's character anally rapes Schneider's character using butter as a lubricant.\nIn a 2006 interview, Schneider said that the scene was not in the script and that \"when they told me, I had a burst of anger. Woo! I threw everything. And nobody can force someone to do something not in the script. But I didn't know that. I was too young\".\nIn 2007, Schneider recounted feelings of sexual humiliation pertaining to the rape scene:\nSchneider also said that she considers Bertolucci a \"gangster and a pimp\". In 2011, Bertolucci denied that he \"stole her youth\" (she was 19 at the time of filming), and commented, \"The girl wasn't mature enough to understand what was going on.\" Schneider remained friends with Brando until his death in 2004, but never made up with Bertolucci. She also claimed that Brando and Bertolucci \"made a fortune\" from the film while she made very little money.\n\nSchneider died in 2011. In February 2013, Bertolucci spoke about the film's effect on Schneider on the Dutch television show \"College Tour\". In the interview, Bertolucci clarified that although the rape scene was in the script, the detail of using butter as a lubricant was improvised the day of shooting and Schneider did not know about the use of the butter beforehand. Bertolucci said that \"I feel guilty, but I don't regret it.\" In September 2013, Bertolucci spoke again about the scene at a retrospective at the Cinémathèque Française, claiming that the scene was in the script but the use of butter was not. Bertolucci said that he and Brando \"decided not to say anything to Maria to get a more realistic response\".\n\nIn November 2016, a slightly different version of the 2013 \"College Tour\" interview was uploaded to YouTube by the Spanish nonprofit \"El Mundo de Alycia\" on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. accompanied by a statement concluding that the scene \"abused [Schneider] psychologically and, who knows if also, physically...\" This gained attention when \"Yahoo! Movies\" writer Tom Butler wrote an article about it prompting several celebrities to condemn the film and Bertolucci and a number of newspapers picked up on the story, reporting that Bertolucci had \"confessed\" to Schneider being raped on set, prompting Bertolucci to release a statement, clarifying that a simulation and not an actual intercourse took place.\n\nBertolucci also shot a scene which showed Brando's genitals, but in 1973 explained, \"I had so identified myself with Brando that I cut it out of shame for myself. To show him naked would have been like showing me naked.\" Schneider declared in an interview that \"Marlon said he felt raped and manipulated by it and he was 48. And he was Marlon Brando!\". Like Schneider, Brando confirmed that the sex was simulated.\nBertolucci said about Brando that he was \"a monster as an actor and a darling as a human being\". Brando refused to speak to Bertolucci for 15 years after the production was completed.\n\nHowever;\n\nThe film's opening credits include two paintings by Francis Bacon: \"Double Portrait of Lucian Freud and Frank Auerbach\" and \"Study for a Portrait of Isabel Rawsthorne\". The hues used in the film were inspired by the paintings of Bacon. During pre-production, Bertolucci frequently visited an exhibit of Bacon's paintings at the Grand Palais in Paris; he said that the light and colour in Bacon's paintings reminded him of Paris in the winter, when\nthe lights of the stores are on, and there is a very beautiful contrast between the leaden gray of the wintry sky and the warmth of the show windows...the light in the paintings was the major source of inspiration for the style we were looking for.Bacon's painting style often depicted human skin like raw meat and the painter's inspiration included meat hanging in a butcher shops window and human skin diseases.\n\nCinematographer Vittorio Storaro had previously worked with Bertolucci on \"The Conformist\" and often used an azure hue in the film. Storaro later told a reporter that\n\nafter \"The Conformist\" I had a moment of crisis; I was asking myself: what can come after azure?...I did not have the slightest idea that an orange film could be born. We needed another kind of emotion...It was the case of \"Last Tango\".\n\nFor \"Last Tango in Paris\", Bertolucci and Storaro took inspiration from Bacon's paintings by using \"rich oranges, light and cool grays, icy whites, and occasional reds combine[d] with Bertolucci's own tasteful choices of soft browns, blond browns, and delicate whites with bluish and pink shadings\".\n\nBertolucci took Marlon Brando to the Bacon exhibit and told Brando that he \"wanted him to compare himself with Bacon's human figures because I felt that, like them, Marlon's face and body were characterized by a strange and infernal plasticity. I wanted Paul to be like the figures that obsessively return in Bacon: faces eaten by something coming from the inside.\"\n\nAs was his practice in previous films, Brando refused to memorise his lines for many of the scenes. Instead he wrote his lines on cue cards and posted them around the set, leaving Bertolucci with the problem of keeping them out of the picture frame. During his long monologue over the body of his wife, for example, Brando's dramatic lifting of his eyes upward is not spontaneous dramatic acting but a search for his next cue card. Brando asked Bertolucci if he could \"write lines on Maria's rear end\", which the director rejected.\n\nThe film score was composed by Gato Barbieri, arranged and conducted by Oliver Nelson, and the soundtrack album was released on the United Artists label. AllMusic's Richie Unterberger noted \"Although some of the smoky sax solos get a little uncomfortably close to 1970s fusion cliché, Gato Barbieri's score to Bertolucci's 1972 classic is an overall triumph. Suspenseful jazz, melancholy orchestration, and actual tangos fit the film's air of erotic longing, melancholy despair, and doomed fate\".\n\n\"All compositions by Gato Barbieri.\"\n\n\n\"Last Tango in Paris\" was edited by Franco Arcalli and Roberto Perpignani.\n\nThe film opened in late 1972 in France, where filmgoers stood in two-hour queues for the first month of its run at the seven cinemas where it was screened. It gained unanimous positive reviews in every major French publication. To circumvent state censorship, thousands of Spaniards travelled hundreds of kilometers to reach French cinemas in Biarritz and Perpignan where \"Tango\" was playing. Following that, it was released in the United States, Great Britain, and other venues.\n\nThe film generated considerable controversy because of its subject and graphic portrayal of sex. Schneider provided frank interviews in the wake of \"Tango\"s controversy, claiming she had slept with 50 men and 70 women, that she was \"bisexual completely\", and that she had used heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. She also said of Bertolucci, \"He's quite clever and more free and very young. Everybody was digging what he was doing, and we were all very close.\"\n\nDuring the publicity for the film's release, Bertolucci said Schneider developed an \"Oedipal fixation with Brando\". Schneider said Brando sent her flowers after they first met, and \"from then on he was like a daddy\". In a later interview, Schneider denied this, saying, \"Brando tried to be very paternalistic with me, but it really wasn't any father-daughter relationship.\" However, in 2007 she said that \"for me, he was more like a father figure and I a daughter.\"\n\nThe film premiered in New York City on 14 October 1972, to enormous public controversy, as it had received coverage after opening in France. The media frenzy surrounding the film generated intense popular interest as well as moral condemnation, and the film was featured in cover stories in both \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" magazines. \"Playboy\" published a photo spread of Brando and Schneider \"cavorting in the nude\". \"Time\" wrote,\nThe \"Village Voice\" reported walkouts by board members and \"vomiting by well-dressed wives\". Columnist William F. Buckley and ABC's Harry Reasoner denounced the film as \"pornography disguised as art\".\n\nAfter local government officials failed to ban the film in Montclair, New Jersey, theatergoers had to push through a mob of 200 outraged residents, who hurled epithets like \"perverts\" and \"homos\" at the attendees. Later, a bomb threat temporarily halted the showing. The New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women denounced the film as a tool of \"male domination\".\n\nThe film's scandal centred mostly on an anal rape scene, featuring Paul's use of butter as a lubricant. According to Schneider, the scene was not in the original script, but was Brando's idea. Other critics focused on when the character Paul asks Jeanne to insert her fingers in his anus, then asks her to prove her devotion to him by, among other things, having sex with a pig. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described the film's sexual content as the artistic expression of the \"era of Norman Mailer and Germaine Greer\".\n\nFilm critic Pauline Kael endorsed the film, writing that \"\"Tango\" has altered the face of an art form. This is a movie people will be arguing about for as long as there are movies.\" She called it \"the most powerfully erotic movie ever made, and it may turn out to be the most liberating movie ever made.\" United Artists reprinted the whole of Kael's rave as a double-page advertisement in the Sunday \"New York Times\". Kael's review of \"Last Tango in Paris\" is regarded as the most influential piece of her career. The American critic Roger Ebert repeatedly described it as \"the most famous movie review ever published\", and he added the film to his \"Great Movies\" collection.\n\nAmerican director Robert Altman expressed unqualified praise: \"I walked out of the screening and said to myself, 'How dare I make another film?' My personal and artistic life will never be the same.\" Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 31 reviews and gave the film an approval rating of 80%, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Naturalistic but evocative, \"Last Tango in Paris\" is a vivid exploration of pain, love, and sex featuring a typically towering Marlon Brando performance.\"\n\nThe film earned $12,625,000 in North American rentals in 1973.\n\nBritish censors reduced the duration of the sodomy sequence before permitting the film to be released in the United Kingdom, though it is not cut in later releases. Mary Whitehouse, a Christian morality campaigner, expressed outrage that the film had been certified \"X\" rather than banned outright, and Labour MP Maurice Edelman denounced the classification as \"a license to degrade\". Chile banned the film entirely for nearly thirty years under its military government, and the film was similarly suppressed in Portugal (until the Carnation Revolution in 1974, when its première became an example of the freedom democracy allows) and South Korea.\n\nIn Australia, the film was released uncut with an R certificate by the Australian Classification Board on 1 February 1973. It received a VHS release by Warner Home Video with the same classification on 1 January 1987, forbidding sale or hire to anyone under the age of 18.\n\nIn Italy, the film was released on 15 December 1972, grossing an unprecedented $100,000 in six days. One week later, however, police seized all copies on the order of a prosecutor, who defined the film as \"self-serving pornography\", and its director was put on trial for \"obscenity\". Following first degree and appeal trials, the fate of the film was sealed on 26 January 1976 by the Italian Supreme Court, which sentenced all copies to be destroyed (though some were preserved by the National Film Library). Bertolucci was served with a four-month suspended sentence in prison and had his civil rights revoked for five years, depriving him of voting rights.\n\nIn Canada, the film was banned by the Nova Scotia Board of Censors, leading to the landmark 1978 Supreme Court of Canada split decision in \"Nova Scotia (Board of Censors) v McNeil\", which upheld the provinces' right to censor films.\n\nBrando received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Bertolucci was nominated for Best Director.\n\n"}

As the number of multicultural families increased in Korean society, the number of children in multicultural families also increased. New policies have been created to respond to the problems faced by children of multicultural families.\n\nPolicies designed ot support multicultural families in South Korea are aimed at families with people who have acquired South Korean nationality. It can be defined as a family type where two cultures coexist in one family through international marriage, but also includes the families of foreign workers, North Korean refugee families, and ethnic Korean families moving to Korea.\n\nThe first category, international marriage families, refers to a family consisting of a married Korean citizen and a foreign spouse. The second category, the families of foreign workers, includes those that foreign workers bring with them to Korea or new families formed by foreign workers in Korea. Most of those families include children. The third category, North Korean refugee families, is composed of residents from North Korea with the official registration. These people have left North Korean society with various motives. In some cases, refugees escape North Korea with their family members, but policies are also designed for those who start a new family in South Korea. The final category includes ethnic-Korean families who were born and raised in China or Russia with a unique Korean culture, and settled in South Korea for the purpose of immigration, employment while their ancestors left Korea with various background.\n\nChildren of multicultural families are defined as children born between spouses of Koreans and foreign residents with different cultural background. At first, children of multicultural families were called \"Kosian\" or mixed-blood. Later, people started to use value-neutral term 'international marriage children' or 'children of international marriage immigrants'. More recently, people began to use the term 'children of multicultural families'.\n\nFirst, there are children of international marriage immigrants. Those are a children who one of their parents have Korean nationality and another parent have foreign nationality. Second, there are children of foreign worker's families. Immigrant worker bring their children over Korea or birth their children in Korea. Most of them have their own country's nationality, live in Korea as foreign. They cannot receive support based on Multicultural families supporting policy. It is a service for multicultural family to adapt to Korea and to support economical self-reliance. But the number of them has been increased and some of them acquired Korea nationality. Third, children of North Korean refugee family called 'saeteomin' as a defector. They acquire Korea nationality through naturalization. They have cultural problem because South Korea and North Korea have been formed different culture after the division of Korea into north and south.\n\"What kind of cultural problems? Examples please.\"\n\nImmigrant Youth is an adolescents who come to Korea after growing in their own country because of their parent's remarriage with Korean or a children of International marriage families who come to Korea after growing in one of their parents country in adolescence. In other words, Immigrant youth is school age teenagers who have foreign nationality, and children who settle down to Korea in the middle of growing in their mother country. They are different with children of multicultural family who have Korean nationality, and who learn and use Korean language since birth in aspects of nationality. In perspective of law of multicultural family, immigrant youth is just ‘foreigner’, so that immigrant youth cannot be subject to the law about multicultural family.\n\nThe number of children of multicultural family is 207,693 in 2015. The number of children who under 6 years old are 110,000, and it takes 60%.

The staff oversees a variety of programs including, but not limited to: the DNA Resource Center, the Stalking Resource Center, the Financial Crime Resource Center, the National Compassion Fund, Victim Connect and the D.C. Victim Hotline. The National Center for Victims of Crime hosts the annual National Training Institute, designed to share current research and effective policies with service providers, in order to advance the quality of services available to victims of crime.\n\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime holds an annual National Training Institute. The National Training Institute is held in conjunction with the National Crime Victim Bar Association National Conference, \"Civil Actions for Criminal Acts\". The National Training Institute emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach to sharing promising practices, current research, and effective programs and policies that are victim-centered, practice-based, and research-informed. The National Training Institute is a forum for law enforcement, victim service professionals, allied practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to share current developments and build new collaborations. Sessions will highlight practical information to better support services for the wide range of persons victimized by crimes of all types.\n\nThe VictimConnect Resource Center is a project funded by the Office for Victims of Crime and launched in July 2015. It is a place for victims of any crime to learn about their rights and options—confidentially and compassionately. VictimConnect can be accessed anywhere in the United States through a traditional telephone-based helpline and innovative online chat services Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Time. \n\nStaffers of the helpline are called victim assistance specialists, and they have specialized training in helping victims connect with resources, access referrals, and craft next steps to regain control over their lives. Both English and Spanish speakers are available and the program has access to interpreters for over 200 languages. Additionally, VictimConnect has a Senior Services Program to assist senior victims of abuse or financial fraud. Senior services staff have been specifically trained to provide referrals, community resources, and additional support to prevent and increase awareness of elder abuse.\n\nThe DC Victim Hotline officially launched on October 1, 2015.

The Victim Assistance Specialists staffing the hotline build connections with community partners through networking and cross-training. They provide basic crisis-intervention and referrals to community organizations.\n\nFollowing the murders at Sandy Hook Elementary School, movie theater in Aurora, Sikh temple in Oak Creek, and Virginia Tech, the victims' families found that questions over the method of distributing charitable contributions caused them even more pain. Questions included how much should go to the family of each murdered victim, how much should go to survivors who witnessed the murders and will need years of therapy, and who should make these decisions. There were also significant delays in the distribution of donations and questions over whether the organization that collected the donations should retain a portion of the donations. \n\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime created the National Compassion Fund in order to establish a method and rubric for collecting and distributing donations to victims that could be set up quickly and distributed fairly following a mass shooting. \n\nThe National Compassion Fund has collected charitable donations and distributed funds to victims of the 2014 Fort Hood shooting, 2015 Chattanooga shootings, 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and the 2018 Cincinnati shooting.\n\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime supported the Elder Abuse Prevention and Protection Act of 2017, which increased professional training for federal investigators and prosecutors, designated prosecutors to handle cases of elder abuse in each federal judicial district, established elder justice coordinators in the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection and the U.S. Department of Justice, and increased penalties for perpetrators of elder abuse. \n\nIn December 2017, the National Center for Victims of Crime supported the Combat Online Predators Act, which would increase the maximum sentence in federal prison for stalking a minor. \n\nIn January 2018, the National Center for Victims of Crime supported the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act, which would make it illegal for amateur athletics governing bodies to fail to report sex-abuse allegations to a law enforcement authority within 24 hours. It would also extend the civil statute of limitations for human trafficking and federal sex offenses. It would also require national governing bodies to develop and enforce methods to prevent, report, and respond to the abuse of child athletes. \n\nIn February 2018, the National Center of Victims supported the Crime Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act, which would provide a legal process for restitution for victims of child pornography in Connecticut.\n\nIn 2000, the National Center for Victims of Crime partnered with the U.S. Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women to create the Stalking Resource Center (SRC). Since its inception, the Stalking Resource Center has trained over 100,000 professionals who work with victims in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany and provided technical assistance to hundreds of communities seeking to enhance their response to stalking.\n\nIn January 2004, the National Center for Victims of Crime established the month of January as National Stalking Awareness Month in order to raise awareness of the crime of stalking.\n\nThe federal grant funding the Stalking Resource Center was awarded to a different nonprofit organization, AEquitas, effective October 1, 2017. AEquitas renamed it the Stalking Prevention, Awareness, and Resource Center (SPARC).\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the National Center for Victims of Crime held free forums to help survivors of victims decide whether to join the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund or seek damages in court.

Her husband was convicted, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. At a second trial, he was found not guilty. \n\nAt a national meeting of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Alexander von Auersperg, her son, met E. Gene Patterson, a co-chairman of a national victims' coalition. The two of them teamed up with Morris Gurley, his mother's financial adviser, to form a new nonprofit organization with Patterson as director. The organization was named the Sunny von Bulow Victim Advocacy Center, and it was originally located in Fort Worth, Texas. Auersperg envisioned the organization to be a national information and referral organization for victim-advocate groups. \n\nThe organization was renamed the National Victim Center around 1988, and it became the National Center for Victims of Crime in December 1998.\n\n"}

It is not uncommon for a punk house to be anarchist, strictly straight-edge, or vegan. A clique of punks may start a punk house by squatting an abandoned building, by renting, or by owning property. Punk houses are often communally inhabited in an attempt to minimize the individual expense of rent or property tax.\n\nPunk houses serve as backdrops for local scenes; punk houses often provide overnight shelter to touring punk rock bands, and sometimes serve as a venue for shows. Bands or record labels sometimes form in a particular punk house. Many punk houses have associated punk zines that sometimes share the name of the house.

{"id": "53584588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53584588", "title": "Saraguro people", "text": "Saraguro people\n\nThe Saraguro is a people of the Kichwa nation most of whom live in Saraguro Canton in the Loja Province of Ecuador. Although most now speak Spanish, \"Runashimi\" or Kichwa, a Quechua dialect, is also spoken and language revitalization efforts are being implemented. Likewise, the Saraguro have retained much of their land, customs and traditional dress. According to the INEC's 2010 population census, the total population of Saraguro canton is 30,183, but that total includes both the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people living in Saraguro.\n\nThe Saraguro may be the descendants of people re-settled from distant regions in the Inca Empire in the 15th and early 16th century.\n\nIn the 1460s the Inca empire conquered the Saraguro area. The pre-Inca people may have been the barely-known Palta or the Cañari. The ancestors of the modern-day Saraguro people, according to oral traditions, were moved to Saraguro by the Incas from other areas, possibly the Colla or other people from the Lake Titicaca and Cuzco regions. The Incas had a policy of forcibly moving people from one region of the empire to another, thereby diversifying the population and dispersing possible opposition to their rule. The resettlement policy was called mitma. The numbers resettled were large, estimated to be up to 80 percent of the population of some provinces.\nOne Spanish document says that the ancestors of present-day Saraguros were elite soldiers in the Inca army. This statement is bolstered by the fact that the Saraguros live along the Inca road or Kapak Ñan that stretched from Cuzco to Tumebamba (the northern capital of the Incas), and onward to Quito and thus occupied an important link for Inca communications and control of the empire. The town of Saraguro, however, seems to have been founded by the Spanish rather than the Incas although a number of Inca ruins are in the nearby area.\n\nWhatever the facts about their origins. Saraguro in the 20th century celebrate their Inca heritage. In a debunked theory, some authors ascribe the black clothing typical of the Saraguro as a sign of mourning for the death of the Inca Emperor Atahualpa. Schools have been named after Inca emperors, Inca customs recreated, Inca architecture copied, and efforts made to preserve the Kichwa language. Historical records and oral traditions also attribute the traditional black and white colors of their clothing to ceremony and nobility, which were the meanings given by the Incas according to chronicler Cieza de León and recounted by the Saraguro. Being descendants of the elite soldiers of the Inca army, they retained that symbolism as well as the male population retained their long-braided hair, which was another marker of nobility among the Incas. Black as a sign of mourning is not part of the Inca symbolism nor among the Saraguros but has been adopted, especially by the young generations. Likewise, they attribute the symbolic concepts of their clothing to a representation of the \"Curiquingue\" (carunculated caracara), which has black and white feathers and was a symbolic bird of the Inca royalty. The \"Curiquingue\" inhabits the Saraguro parish and páramos and its symbols represented in costumes continue to be present in the Kapak Raymi (the Great Celebration) celebrations in Saraguro.\n\nThe Saraguros have retained control over their lands more successfully than many of the Andean subjects of Spanish colonization and contemporary colonialism of the independent country of Ecuador. Part of this may be due to their initial hostility to the Spanish and the Indigenous people who collaborated with them. More importantly, however, the Saraguros were required by the Spanish to maintain an important tambo (inn or way-station) along a major communication route. They successfully argued that the operation and maintenance of the tambo required that they retain their land and its resources. They continued to manage the tambo until the 1940s when a motor road reached the area.\n\nMost of the Saraguros live at intermediate elevations in the Andes between and . Traditionally they are farmers and livestock herders. A shortage of land in their homeland has led many to migrate eastward into the Zamora-Chinchipe Province of Ecuador. Others have migrated to Europe and the United States. Many contemporary Saraguros are doctors, architects, engineers, \nmusicians, photographers, construction workers, artisans, farmers, entrepreneurs, politicians, teachers, lawyers, cooks, activists. And others continue to do agro-pastoralist activities while holding professional careers or combine more than one occupation. While having a distinctive identity, they are engaged in the consummer society and technology as much as most the Ecuadorian society is. Issues such as teenage pregnancy, environmental degradation, deforestation, discrimination, racism, discontinuation of traditions are also present across the Saraguro territory.\n\nSaraguro activists and intellectuals are fighting for food sovereignty, decolonization, water protection, against polluting mining, Indigenous resurgence, legal pluralism, Indigenous Justice and autonomy from the Ecuadorian State.\n\nMacas has honorary university degrees in anthropology, linguistics and jurisprudence.

Rather, the tastes and ambitions of many Saraguro youth point to an alternative conceptualization of Saraguro identity that is both firmly rooted in the \"modern\" and respectful of a long tradition of Indigeneity.

{"id": "13995904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13995904", "title": "Social aspects of television", "text": "Social aspects of television\n\nThe social aspects of television are influences this medium has had on society since its inception. The belief that this impact has been dramatic has been largely unchallenged in media theory since its inception. However, there is much dispute as to what those effects are, how serious the ramifications are and if these effects are more or less evolutionary with human communication.\n\nCurrent research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation. Just as an individual would spend time with a real person sharing opinions and thoughts, pseudo-relationships are formed with TV characters by becoming personally invested in their lives as if they were a close friend so that the individual can satiate the human desire to form meaningful relationships and establish themselves in society. Jaye Derrick and Shira Gabriel of the University of Buffalo, and Kurt Hugenberg of Miami University found that when an individual is not able to participate in interactions with real people, they are less likely to indicate feelings of loneliness when watching their favorite TV show.\n\nThey refer to this finding as the social surrogacy hypothesis. Furthermore, when an event such as a fight or argument disrupts a personal relationship, watching a favorite TV show was able to create a cushion and prevent the individual from experiencing reduced self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy that can often accompany the perceived threat. By providing a temporary substitute for acceptance and belonging that is experienced through social relationships, TV helps to relieve feelings of depression and loneliness when those relationships are not available. This benefit is considered a positive consequence of watching television, as it can counteract the psychological damage that is caused by isolation from social relationships.\n\nSeveral studies have found that educational television has many advantages. The Media Awareness Network explains in its article \"The Good Things about Television\" that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely. The article states that television can help young people discover where they fit into society, develop closer relationships with peers and family, and teach them to understand complex social aspects of communication. Dimitri Christakis cites studies in which those who watched \"Sesame Street\" and other educational programs as preschoolers had higher grades, were reading more books, placed more value on achievement and were more creative. Similarly, while those exposed to negative role models suffered, those exposed to positive models behaved better.\n\nThe rich array of pejoratives for television (for example, \"boob tube\" and \"chewing gum for the mind\" and so forth) indicate a disdain held by many people for this medium. Newton N. Minow spoke of the \"vast wasteland\" that was the television programming of the day in his 1961 speech. \nComplaints about the social influence of television have been heard from the U.S. justice system as investigators and prosecutors decry what they refer to as \"the CSI syndrome\". They complain that, because of the popularity and considerable viewership of \"\" and its spin-offs, juries today expect to be 'dazzled\", and will acquit criminals of charges unless presented with impressive physical evidence, even when motive, testimony, and lack of alibi are presented by the prosecution. \nTelevision has also been credited with changing the norms of social propriety, although the direction and value of this change are disputed. Milton Shulman, writing about television in the 1960s, wrote that \"TV cartoons showed cows without udders and not even a pause was pregnant,\" and noted that on-air vulgarity was highly frowned upon. Shulman suggested that, even by the 1970s, television was shaping the ideas of propriety and appropriateness in the countries the medium blanketed. He asserted that, as a particularly \"pervasive and ubiquitous\" medium, television could create a comfortable familiarity with and acceptance of language and behavior once deemed socially unacceptable. Television, as well as influencing its viewers, evoked an imitative response from other competing media as they struggle to keep pace and retain viewer- or readership. \nAccording to a study published in 2008, conducted by John Robinson and Steven Martin from the University of Maryland, people who are not satisfied with their lives spend 30% more time watching TV than satisfied people do. The research was conducted with 30,000 people during the period between 1975 and 2006. This contrasted with a previous study, which indicated that watching TV was the happiest time of the day for some people. Based on his study, Robinson commented that the pleasurable effects of television may be likened to an addictive activity, producing \"momentary pleasure but long-term misery and regret.\"\n\nOne theory says that when a person plays video games or watches TV, the basal ganglia portion of the brain becomes very active and dopamine is released. Some scientists believe that release of high amounts of dopamine reduces the amount of the neurotransmitter available for control of movement, perception of pain and pleasure and formation of feelings. A study conducted by Herbert Krugman found that in television viewers, the right side of the brain is twice as active as the left side, which causes a state of hypnosis.\n\nResearch shows that watching television starting at a young age can profoundly affect children's development. These effects include obesity, language delays, and learning disabilities. Physical inactivity while viewing TV reduces necessary exercise and leads to over-eating. Language delays occur when a child doesn't interact with others. Children learn language best from live interaction with parents or other individuals. Resulting learning disabilities from over-watching TV include ADHD, concentration problems and even reduction of IQ. Children who watch too much television can thus have difficulties starting school because they aren't interested in their teachers. Children should watch a maximum of 2 hours daily if any television.\n\nMany scientifical studies has been published about the embedded use of subliminal messages in songs, video and digital TV, trying to manipulate the choices of watchers and the public opinion. This point of view has hold up some countries to approve law, with the purpose of protecting citizens and their children. \n\nStudies in both children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and obesity. \nA study found that watching television decreases the metabolic rate in children to below that found in children at rest. Author John Steinbeck describes television watchers:\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children under two years of age should not watch any television and children two and older should watch one to two hours at most. Children who watch more than four hours of television a day are more likely to become overweight.\n\nTV watching and other sedentary activities are associated with greater risk of heart attack, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and death.\n\nLegislators, scientists and parents are debating the effects of television violence on viewers, particularly youth. Fifty years of research on the impact of television on children's emotional and social development have not ended this debate.\nSome scholars have claimed that the evidence clearly supports a causal relationship between media violence and societal violence. However, other authors note significant methodological problems with the literature and mismatch between increasing media violence and decreasing crime rates in the United States. \nA 2002 article in Scientific American suggested that compulsive television watching, television addiction, was no different from any other addiction, a finding backed up by reports of withdrawal symptoms among families forced by circumstance to cease watching. However, this view has not yet received widespread acceptance among all scholars, and \"television addiction\" is not a diagnoseable condition according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -IV -TR. \nA longitudinal study in New Zealand involving 1000 people (from childhood to 26 years of age) demonstrated that \"television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with poor educational achievement by 12 years of age\". The same paper noted that there was a significant negative association between time spent watching television per day as a child and educational attainment by age 26: the more time a child spent watching television at ages 5 to 15, the less likely they were to have a university degree by age 26. However, recent research (Schmidt et al., 2009) has indicated that, once other factors are controlled for, television viewing appears to have little to no impact on cognitive performance, contrary to previous thought. However, this study was limited to cognitive performance in childhood. Numerous studies have also examined the relationship between TV viewing and school grades.\n\nA study published in the \"Journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy\" concluded that parental television involvement was associated with greater body satisfaction among adolescent girls, less sexual experience amongst both male and female adolescents, and that parental television involvement may influence self-esteem and body image, in part by increasing parent-child closeness. However, a more recent article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard cautioned that the literature on media and body dissatisfaction is weaker and less consistent than often claimed and that media effects have been overemphasized. Similarly recent work by Laurence Steinbrerg and Kathryn Monahan has found that, using propensity score matching to control for other variables, television viewing of sexual media had no impact on teen sexual behavior in a longitudinal analysis.\n\nMany studies have found little or no effect of television viewing on viewers (see Freedman, 2002). For example, a recent long-term outcome study of youth found no long-term relationship between watching violent television and youth violence or bullying.\n\nOn July 26, 2000 the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry stated that \"prolonged viewing of media violence can lead to emotional desensitization toward violence in real life.\" However, scholars have since analyzed several statements in this release, both about the number of studies conducted, and a comparison with medical effects, and found many errors.\n\nTelevision is used to promote commercial, social and political agendas. Public service announcements (including those paid for by governing bodies or politicians), news and current affairs, television advertisements, advertorials and talk shows are used to influence public opinion. The Cultivation Hypothesis suggests that some viewers may begin to repeat questionable or even blatantly fictitious information gleaned from the media as if it were factual. Considerable debate remains, however, whether the Cultivation Hypothesis is well supported by scientific literature, however, the effectiveness of television for propaganda (including commercial advertising) is unsurpassed. The US military and State Department often turn to media to broadcast into hostile territory or nation.\n\nWhile the effects of television programs depend on what is actually consumed, Neil Postman argues that the dominance of entertaining, but not informative programming, creates a politically ignorant society, undermining democracy: \"Americans are the best entertained and quite likely the least-informed people in the Western world.\" However, some broadcasters do offer Americans intelligent political narrative and argument. This offers otherwise ignorant viewers, who may not read about politics elsewhere, the opportunity to access current or historical political views, for example.\n\nAnother interesting facet of the introduction of television to the political scene can be observed in the infamous Kennedy-Nixon presidential debate of 1960. Although the actual influence of television in these debates have been argued over time, the recent studies of James N. Druckman, previous professor at the University of Minnesota, determined that the visually-based television may have allowed viewers to evaluate the candidates more on their image (including perceived personality traits), than previous popular mediums which allowed the transmission of voice alone. Termed \"viewer-listener\" disagreement, this phenomenon may still affect the political scene of today.\n\nWhile women, who were \"traditionally more isolated than men\" were given equal opportunity to consume shows about more \"manly\" endeavors, men's \"feminine\" sides are tapped by the emotional nature of many television programs.\n\nTelevision played a significant role in the feminist movement. Although most of the women portrayed on television conformed to stereotypes, television also showed the lives of men as well as news and current affairs. These \"other lives\" portrayed on television left many women unsatisfied with their current socialization.\n\nThe representation of males and females on the television screen has been a subject of much discussion since the television became commercially available in the late 1930s. In 1964 Betty Friedan claimed that \"television has represented the American Woman as a \"stupid, unattractive, insecure little household drudge who spends her martyred mindless, boring days dreaming of love—and plotting nasty revenge against her husband.\" As women started to revolt and protest to become equals in society in the 1960s and 1970s, their portrayal on the television was an issue that they addressed. Journalist Susan Faludi suggested, \"The practices and programming of network television in the 1980s were an attempt to get back to those earlier stereotypes of women.\" Through television, even the most homebound women can experience parts of our culture once considered primarily male, such as sports, war, business, medicine, law, and politics. Since at least the 1990s there has been a trend of showing males as insufferable and possibly spineless fools (e.g. Homer Simpson, Ray Burone).\nThe inherent intimacy of television makes it one of the few public arenas in our society where men routinely wear makeup and are judged as much on their personal appearance and their \"style\" as on their \"accomplishments.\"\n\nFrom 1930 till today daytime television hasn't changed much. Soap operas and talk shows still dominate the daytime time slot. Primetime television since the 1950s has been aimed at and catered towards males. In 1952, 68% of characters in primetime dramas were male; in 1973, 74% of characters in these shows were male. In 1970 the National Organization for Women (NOW) took action. They formed a task force to study and change the \"derogatory stereotypes of women on television.\" In 1972 they challenged the licences of two network-owned stations on the basis of their sexist programming. In the 1960s the shows \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"Bewitched\" insinuated that the only way that a woman could escape her duties was to use magic. Industry analysis Shari Anne Brill of Carat USA states, \"For years, when men were behind the camera, women were really ditsy. Now you have female leads playing superheroes, or super business women.\" Current network broadcasting features a range of female portrayals. This is evident in a 2014 study showing that \"42% of all major characters on television are female\".\n\nIn its infancy, television was a time-dependent, fleeting medium; it acted on the schedule of the institutions that broadcast the television signal or operated the cable. Fans of regular shows planned their schedules so that they could be available to watch their shows at their time of broadcast. The term \"appointment television\" was coined by marketers to describe this kind of attachment.\n\nThe viewership's dependence on schedule lessened with the invention of programmable video recorders, such as the videocassette recorder and the digital video recorder. Consumers could watch programs on their own schedule once they were broadcast and recorded. More recently, television service providers also offer video on demand, a set of programs that can be watched at any time.\n\nBoth mobile phone networks and the Internet can give us video streams, and video sharing websites have become popular. In addition, the jumps in processing power within smartphone and tablet devices has facilitated uptake of \"hybridised\" TV viewing, where viewers simultaneously watch programs on TV sets and interact with online social networks via their mobile devices. A 2012 study by Australian media company Yahoo!7 found 36% of Australians will call or text family and friends and 41% will post on Facebook while watching TV. Yahoo!7 has already experienced significant early uptake of its Fango mobile app, which encourages social sharing and discussion of TV programs on Australian free-to-air networks.\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Scalar has developed a very small TV system attached to eyeglasses, called \"Teleglass T3-F\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30865341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30865341", "title": "Somatotype and constitutional psychology", "text": "Somatotype and constitutional psychology\n\nSomatotype is a taxonomy developed in the 1940s by American psychologist William Herbert Sheldon to categorize the human physique according to the relative contribution of three fundamental elements which he termed \"somatotypes\". He named these after the three germ layers of embryonic development: the endoderm, (which develops into the digestive tract), the mesoderm, (which becomes muscle, heart and blood vessels) and the ectoderm (which forms the skin and nervous system). His initial visual methodology has been discounted as subjective and largely discredited, but later formulaic variations of the methodology, developed by his original research assistant Barbara Heath, and later Lindsay Carter and Rob Rempel are still in academic use.\n\nConstitutional psychology is a now neglected theory, also developed by Sheldon in the 1940s, which attempted to associate his somatotype classifications with human temperament types. The foundation of these ideas originated with Francis Galton and eugenics. Sheldon and Earnest Hooton were seen as leaders of a school of thought, popular in anthropology at the time, which held that the size and shape of a person's body indicated intelligence, moral worth and future achievement.\n\nIn his 1954 book, \"Atlas of Men\", Sheldon categorised all possible body types according to a scale ranging from 1 to 7 for each of the three \"somatotypes\", where the pure \"endomorph\" is 7–1–1, the pure \"mesomorph\" 1–7–1 and the pure \"ectomorph\" scores 1–1–7. From type number, an individual's mental characteristics could supposedly be predicted. Barbara Honeyman Heath, who was Sheldon's main assistant in compiling \"Atlas of Men\", accused him of falsifying the data he used in writing the book.\n\nSheldon's \"somatotypes\" and their associated physical and psychological traits were characterized as follows:\n\n\nThere is evidence that different physiques carry cultural stereotypes. For example, one study found that endomorphs are likely to be perceived as slow, sloppy, and lazy. Mesomorphs, in contrast, are typically stereotyped as popular and hardworking, whereas ectomorphs are often viewed as intelligent but fearful and usually take part in long distance sports, such as marathon running.\n\nThough the psychological bindings have largely been neglected, Sheldon's physical taxonomy has persisted, particularly the Heath-Carter variant of the methodology. This formulaic approach utilises an individual's: weight (kg), height (cm), upper arm circumference (cm), maximal calf circumference (cm), femur breadth (cm), humerus breadth (cm), triceps skinfold (mm), subscapular skinfold (mm), supraspinal skinfold (mm), and medial calf skinfold (mm), and remains popular in anthropomorphic research, as to quote Rob Rempel \"With modifications by Parnell in the late 1950s, and by Heath and Carter in the mid 1960s somatotype has continued to be the best single qualifier of total body shape\".\n\nThis variant utilizes the following series of equations to assess a subject's traits against each of the three somatotypes, each assessed on a seven-point scale, with 0 indicating no correlation and a 7 a very strong:\n\n\nThis numerical approach has gone on to be incorporated in the current sports science and physical education curriculums of numerous institutions, ranging from the UK's secondary level GCSE curriculums (14- to 16-year-olds), the Indian UPSC Civil Service exams, to MSc programs worldwide, and has been utilized in numerous academic papers, including:\n\n\nSheldon's ideas that body type was an indicator of temperament, moral character or potential—while popular in an atmosphere accepting of the theories of eugenics—were soon widely vilified.\n\nThe principal criticism of Sheldon's constitutional theory was that it was not a theory at all but one general assumption, continuity between structure and behavior, and a set of descriptive concepts to measure physique and behavior in a scaled manner.\n\nHis use of thousands of photographs of naked Ivy League undergraduates, obtained without explicit consent, from a pre-existing program evaluating student posture, has been described as scandalous, and perverted (\"the study of nude people by lewd people\").\n\nHis original visual assessment methodology, based on the photographs, has also been criticized as subjective.\n\nHis original thesis has also been described as fraudulent for knowingly failing to acknowledge/account for body shape changing with age.\n\nHis suggestion of a genetic link to both body shape and personality traits has also been described as objectional.\n\nSheldon's work has also been criticized as being heavily burdened by his own stereotypical and discriminatory views.\n\nWhile popular in the 1950s, Sheldon's claims have been dismissed by modern scientists, calling them \"outdated\" or \"quackery\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34960137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34960137", "title": "Turks in Algeria", "text": "Turks in Algeria\n\nThe Turks in Algeria, also commonly referred to as Algerian Turks, Algerian-Turkish Algero-Turkish and Turkish-Algerians (; ; ) are ethnic Turkish descendants who, alongside the Arabs and Berbers, constitute an admixture to Algeria's population. During Ottoman rule, Turkish settlers began to migrate to the region predominately from Anatolia and many intermarried with the native population; the male offspring of these marriages were referred to as \"Kouloughlis\" () due to their mixed Turkish and central Maghrebi heritage. Consequently, the terms \"Turks\" and \"Kouloughlis\" have traditionally been used to distinguish between those of full and partial Turkish ancestry.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century the French colonisers in North Africa classified the populations under their rule as \"Arab\" and \"Berber\", despite the fact that these countries had diverse populations, which were also composed of ethnic Turks and Kouloughlis. According to the U.S. Department of State \"Algeria's population, [is] a mixture of Arab, Berber, and Turkish in origin\"; whilst Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs has reported that the demographics of Algeria includes a \"strong Turkish admixture\".\n\nThus, today, numerous estimates suggest that Algerians of Turkish descent still represent 5% to 25% (including partial Turkish origin) of the country's population. Since the Ottoman era, the Turks settled mostly in the coastal regions of Algeria and Turkish descendants continue to live in the big cities today. Moreover, Turkish descended families also continue to practice the Hanafi school of Islam (in contrast to the ethnic Arabs and Berbers who practice the Maliki school) and many retain their Turkish-origin surnames—which mostly express a provenance or ethnic Turkish origin from Anatolia. The Turkish minority have formed the \"\" (Association of Algerian Turks) to promote their culture.\n\nThe foundation of Ottoman Algeria was directly linked to the establishment of the Ottoman province (beylerbeylik) of the Maghreb at the beginning of the 16th century. At the time, fearing that their city would fall into Spanish hands, the inhabitants of Algiers called upon Ottoman corsairs for help. Headed by Oruç Reis and his brother Hayreddin Barbarossa, they took over the rule of the city and started to expand their territory into the surrounding areas. Sultan Selim I (r. 1512-20) agreed to assume control of the Maghreb regions ruled by Hayreddin as a province, granting the rank of governor-general (beylerbey) to Hayreddin. In addition, the Sultan sent 2,000 janissaries, accompanied by about 4,000 volunteers to the newly established Ottoman province of the Maghreb, whose capital was to be the city of Algiers. These Turks, mainly from Anatolia, called each other \"yoldaş\" (a Turkish word meaning \"comrade\") and called their sons born of unions with local women \"Kuloğlu’s\", implying that they considered their children's status as that of the Sultan's servants. Likewise, to indicate in the registers that a certain person is an offspring of a Turk and a local woman, the note \"ibn al-turki\" (or \"kuloglu\") was added to his name.\n\nThe exceptionally high number of Turks greatly affected the character of the city of Algiers, and that of the province at large. In 1587, the province was divided into three different provinces, which were established where the modern states of Algeria, Libya and Tunisia, were to emerge. Each of these provinces was headed by a Pasha sent from Constantinople for a three-year term. The division of the Maghreb launched the process that led eventually to the janissary corps' rule over the province. From the end of the 16th century, Algiers's Ottoman elite chose to emphasize its Turkish identity and nurture its Turkish character to a point at which it became an ideology. By so doing, the Algerian province took a different path from that of its neighboring provinces, where local-Ottoman elites were to emerge. The aim of nurturing the elite's Turkishness was twofold: it limited the number of the privileged group (the ocak) while demonstrating the group's loyalty to the Sultan. By the 18th century there was 50,000 janissaries concentrated in the city of Algiers alone.\n\nThe lifestyle, language, religion, and area of origin of the Ottoman elite's members created remarkable differences between the Algerian Ottoman elite and the indigenous population. For example, members of the elite adhered to Hanafi law while the rest of the population subscribed to the Maliki school. Most of the elites originated from non-Arab regions of the Empire. Furthermore, most members of the elite spoke Ottoman Turkish while the local population spoke Algerian Arabic and even differed from the rest of the population in their dress.\n\nFrom its establishment, the military-administrative elite worked to reinvigorate itself by enlisting volunteers from non-Arab regions of the Ottoman Empire, mainly from Anatolia. Hence, local recruiting of Arabs was almost unheard of and during the 18th century a more or less permanent network of recruiting officers was kept in some coastal Anatolian cities and on some of the islands of the Aegean Sea. The recruitment policy was therefore one of the means employed to perpetuate the Turkishness of the Ottoman elite and was practiced until the fall of the province in 1830.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the militia practiced a restrictive policy on marriages between its members and local women. A married soldier would lose his right of residence in one of the city's eight barracks and the daily ration of bread to which he was entitled. He would also lose his right to purchase a variety of products at a preferential price. Nonetheless, the militia's marriage policy made clear distinctions among holders of different ranks: the higher the rank, the more acceptable the marriage of its holder. This policy can be understood as part of the Ottoman elite's effort to perpetuate its Turkishness and to maintain its segregation from the rest of the population. Furthermore, the militia's marriage policy, in part, emerged from fear of an increase in the number of the kuloğlus.\n\nThe kuloğlu’s refers to the male offspring of members of the Ottoman elite and the local Algerian women. Due to their link to the local Algerian population via his maternal family, the kuloğlus' loyalty to the Ottoman elite was suspected because of the fear that they might develop another loyalty; they were therefore considered a potential danger to the elite. However, the son of a non-local woman, herself an \"outsider\" in the local population, represented no such danger to the Ottoman elite. Therefore, the Algerian Ottoman elite had a clear policy dictating the perpetuation of its character as a special social group separated from the local population.\n\nNonetheless, John Douglas Ruedy points out that the kuloğlu’s also sought to protect their Turkishness: \nIn the neighbouring province of Tunisia, the maintenance of the Turkishness of the ruling group was not insisted upon, and the kuloğlus could reach the highest ranks of government. However, the janissary corps had lost its supremacy first to the Muradid dynasty (Murad Bey's son was appointed bey), and then to the Husainid Dynasty. The Tunisian situation partly explains the continuation of the Algerian janissary corps' recruitment policy and the manifest will to distance the kuloğlus from the real centres of power. Nonetheless, high-ranking kuloğlus were in the service of the ocak, in military and in administrative capacities, occupying posts explicitly considered out of bounds for them; although there were no kuloğlus who was dey during the 18th century, this seems to be the only exception.\n\nOnce Algeria came under French colonial rule in 1830, approximately 10,000 Turks were expelled and shipped off to Smyrna; moreover, many Turks (alongside other natives) fled to other regions of the Ottoman realms, particularly to Palestine, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt. Nonetheless, by 1832, many Algerian-Turkish descended families, who had not left Algeria, joined a coalition with Emir Abdelkader in order to forge the beginning of a powerful resistance movement against French colonial rule.\n\nIn 1926 Messali Hadj - an Algerian of Turkish origin - founded the first modern nationalist movement for Algerian independence. Another prominent Algerian nationalist leader of Turkish origin was Ahmed Tewfik El Madani who, as the leader of the Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, continued to influence Algerian nationalism. Ahmed Tewfik was also a historian who argued that the Turkish era in Algeria was defamed by European historians and provided the French with convincing arguments to justify their colonial actions. He maintained that the Ottoman Turks had unified Algeria's territory and saved the country from the grip of Christianity as well as from the fate of Muslim Spain. Furthermore, he stated that the Turks who settled in Algeria were \"perfection and nobility itself\" and emphasised their contributions to Algerian society, such as the establishment of religious endowments, mosques and waterworks. By 1956 the Reformist Ulema, under the leadership of Ahmed Tewfik, joined the Algerian National Liberation Front to fight for Algerian independence.\n\nIn 2011 Algerian journalist Mustafa Dala reported in the \"Echorouk El Yawmi\" that Algerians of Turkish origin - particularly the youth - are seeking to revive the Turkish language in Algeria. In his investigation, Dala found that the Turkish minority are already distinguishable by their different customs, especially in regards to clothes and foods, as well as by their Turkish surnames. However, he states that the revival of the Turkish language is a sign of the minority restoring their identity and highlights the \"new Ottomans\" in Algeria.\n\nThe following list are examples of Turkish origin surnames which express an ethnic and provenance origin from Eastern Thrace and Anatolia - regions which today form the modern borders of the Republic of Turkey: \nThe following list are examples of Turkish origin surnames which express a provenance settlement of Turkish families in regions of Algeria: \nThe following list are examples of Turkish origin surnames traditionally used by Turkish families in Constantine:\n\nAcheuk-Youcef, Ali Khodja, Bachtarzi, Benabdallah Khodja, Benelmadjat, Bestandji, Bendali Braham, Bentchakar, Bensakelbordj, Bentchikou, Khaznadar, Salah Bey, Tchanderli Braham.\n\nThe following list are examples of some Turkish origin surnames which express the traditional occupation of Turkish families which settled in Algeria: \n\nThe Algerian Turks generally take pride in their Ottoman-Turkish heritage but also have integrated successfully into Algerian society. Their identity is based on their ethnic Turkish roots and links to mainland Turkey but also to the customs, language, and local culture of Algeria. Due to the three centuries of Turkish rule in Algeria, today many cultural (particularly in regards to food, religion, and dress - and to a lesser extent language), architectural, as well as musical elements of Algeria are of Turkish origin or influence.\n\nDuring the Ottoman era, the Ottoman Turkish language was the official governing language in the region, and the Turkish language was spoken mostly by the Algerian Turkish community. However, today most Algerian Turks speak the Arabic language as their mother tongue. Nonetheless, the legacy of the Turkish language is still apparent and has influenced many words and vocabulary in Algeria. An estimated 634 Turkish words are still used in Algeria today. Therefore, in Algerian Arabic it is possible for a single sentence to include an Arabic subject, a French verb, and for the predicate to be in Berber or Turkish.\n\nMoreover, families of Turkish origin have retained their Turkish family surnames; common names include Barbaros, Hayreddin, Osmanî, Stambouli, Torki, Turki, and Uluçali; job titles or functions have also become family names within the Algerian-Turkish community (such as Hazneci, Demirci, Başterzi, Silahtar).\n\nThe Ottoman Turks brought the teaching of the Hanafi law of Sunni Islam to Algeria; consequently, their lifestyle created remarkable differences between the Ottoman Turks and the indigenous population because the ethnic Arabs and Berbers practiced the Maliki school.\n\nToday, the Hanafi school is still practiced among the Turkish descended families. Moreover, the Ottoman mosques in Algeria - which are still used by the Turkish minority - are distinguishable by their octagonal minarets which were built in accordance with the traditions of the Hanafi rite.\n\nToday the Turkish heritage in Algeria is most notably present in their cuisine which they have introduced to Algeria (such as Turkish coffee, Lahmacun, Börek's, desserts and pastries).\n\nThe Turkish minority is estimated to form between 5% to 25% of Algeria's total population, the latter including those of partial Turkish origin.\n\nIn 1993 the Turkish scholar Prof. Dr. Metin Akar estimated that there was 1 million Turks living in Algeria. By 2008 a country report of Algeria by the Oxford Business Group stated that 5% of Algeria's 34.8 million inhabitants were of Turkish descent (accounting to 1.74 million). In the same year, a report by the Turkish Embassy in Algeria stated that there was between 600,000-700,000 people of Turkish origin living in Algeria; however, the Turkish Embassy report also stated that according to the French Embassy's records there was around 2 million Turks in Algeria.\n\nIn recent years, several Turkish academics, as well as Turkish official reports, have reiterated that estimates of the Turkish population range between 600,000 and 2 million. However, a 2010 report published by the Directorate General for Strategy Development points out that these estimates are likely to be low because 1 million Turks migrated and settled in Algeria throughout the 315 years of Ottoman rule. Moreover, the report suggests that due to intermarriages with the local population, 30% of Algeria's population was of Turkish origin in the eighteenth century. In 1953 the Turkish scholar Dr. Sabri Hizmetli claimed that people of Turkish origin still made up 25% of Algeria's population.\n\nBy 2013 the American historian Dr. Niki Gamm argued that the total population of Turkish origin remains unclear and that estimates range between 5-10% of Algeria's population of 37 million (accounting to between 1.85 million and 3.7 million) However, by 2015 the Russian government-controlled news agency Sputnik, citing the 2014 Algerian population statistics, reported that there are 760,000 people of full Turkish origin (i.e. 2% of Algeria's population), whilst those of full and partial Turkish origin account to 9.5 million of Algeria's 38 million inhabitants (i.e. 25% of Algeria's population).\n\nSince the Ottoman era, urban society in the coastal cities of Algeria evolved into an ethnic mix of Turks and Kouloughlis as well as other ethnic groups (Arabs, Berbers, Moors, and Jews). Thus, the Turks settled mainly in the big cities of Algeria and formed their own Turkish quarters; remnants of these old Turkish quarters are still visible today, such as in Algiers (particularly in the Casbah) Annaba, Biskra, Bouïra, Médéa, Mostaganem, and Oran (such as in La Moune and the areas near the Hassan Basha Mosque). Indeed, today, the descendants of Ottoman-Turkish settlers continue to live in the big cities. In particular, the Turks have traditionally had a strong presence in the Tlemcen Province; alongside the Moors, they continue to make up a significant portion of Tlemcen's population and live within their own sectors of the city.\n\nThe Turkish minority have traditionally also had notable populations in various other cities and towns; there is an established Turkish community in Arzew, Bougie, Berrouaghia, Cherchell, Constantine, Djidjelli, Mascara, Mazagran Oued Zitoun, and Tebessa. There is also an established community in Kabylie (such as Tizi Ouzou and Zammora).\n\nMoreover, several suburbs, towns and cities, which have been inhabited by the Turks for centuries, have been named after Ottoman rulers, Turkish families or the Turks in general, including: the Aïn El Turk district (literally \"Fountain of the Turks\") in Oran, the town of Aïn Torki in the Aïn Defla Province, the Aïn Turk commune in Bouïra, the town of Bir Kasdali and the Bir Kasd Ali District in the Bordj Bou Arréridj Province, the town of Bougara and the Bougara District located in Blida Province, the suburb of Hussein Dey and the Hussein Dey District in the Algiers Province, as well as the town of Salah Bey and the Salah Bey District in the Sétif Province.\n\nThere are many Algerian Turks who have emigrated to other countries and hence make up part of Algeria's diaspora. Initially, the first wave of migration occurred in 1830 when many Turks were forced to leave the region once the French took control over Algeria; approximately 10,000 were shipped off to Turkey whilst many others migrated to other regions of the Ottoman Empire, including Palestine, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt. Furthermore, some Turkish/Kouloughli families also settled in Morocco (such as in Tangier and Tétouan).\n\nIn regards to modern migration, there is a noticeable Algerian community of Turkish descent living in England. Many Algerians attend the Suleymaniye Mosque which is owned by the British-Turkish community. There is also thousands of Algerian Turks living in France. Furthermore, some Algerian Turks have also migrated to other European countries; in particular, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, as well as Canada in North America, are top receiving countries of Algerian citizens.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In order to offer appropriate cult rooms, in 2008 the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Zürich respectively of the city of Zürich established the centre in Wipkingen. The theologian and pastor Dinah Hess is as of December 2014 its director, she tries also to find rooms for further parishes, and she is responsible for the rental of rooms and the communal life in the center. Pastor Hess also obliges the communication to the migration churches, and to aware that the Reformed Church sometimes may have a different understanding of mission between the registered partnership, and therefore not to deny, but to carefully address debates on such topics. On monthly meetings, all the church communities discuss organizational items, but also may discuss religious issues.\n\nCurrently there are eight churches from four continents, all of the Protestantism faith, situated in the centre. In addition to the Francophone community from the Republic of the Congo, there are also an Anglophone community of citizens from Nigeria, two Latin American churches for Spanish and Portuguese speaking people, a Tamil community, a Korean church, a Finnish church and a Swiss free church situated in the centre. As at many places in Switzerland, 'loud' worship often is not tolerated, and many communities have difficulty to find locations; therefore the centre promotes these charismatic churches, having in Switzerland usually called 'long', 'loud' and 'exotic' worship.\n\nThe \"Hansomang\" community comprises about 70 people from South Korea. Accompanied by piano, its white-robed choir sings during Sunday each louder than usual in Switzerland, otherwise the service is traditionally reformed, \"well-tempered and calmly\". Hansomang was founded in 2002, supported by the Presbyterian Church of Korea and the Presbyterian Church in Korea, and maintains a partnership with the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches. The Korean community in Bern is connected to Hansomang as a sister church.\n\n\"Eglise Evangélique missionaries International\" EEM is a free church from the Republic of the Congo, founded in 1992, and practicing a \"rollicking, rhythmic, unleashed\" Sunday service. Jeanette acts in worship as a presenter, accompanied by a six-member all-female band. The Francophone community is Protestant, but influenced by Evangelicals in the USA and by the Pentecostal free churches of South Africa. The church is decidedly missionary-oriented and distributes leaflets on the streets. It practices the \"reverse mission\" of migrant churches; the people that were converted to Christianity by European missionaries, \"bring the Gospel back to Europe\".\n\nThe \"Oikos Church\" has its origins in Sri Lanka and was founded in 2004. The Protestant community \"supports people in Sri Lanka and India, which have suffered losses during the war and need help to survive\". On Sunday morning about one hundred believers gather for two and a half hours of service. \"Children running around, the atmosphere is lively, the air stuffy\", a youth worker participates also, and all is accompanied by keyboards and electric piano, praise, and believers witness their experience usually in the Tamil language. During the prayer all speak to himself. Most of the community members refuged to Switzerland in 1989, and about 30% of them gained the Swiss citizenship.\n\n\"Igreja de Língua Portuguesa de Evangélica Zurique\" IELPZ was also founded in 1992 in Zürich. The members come from Latin America, Africa and Europe. The services are held in Portuguese and translated into German.\n\n\"Suomalainen Seurakunta\" (Finnish parish) was founded in 2002, and compatriots in Zürich \"a piece of the Finnish church community\".\n\nThe \"Divine Power Restoration Centre\" DPRC is a non-denominational church with members mainly from Nigeria that also gather on Sunday. It was founded in 2002, by 2010 it was called \" Word base Ministries Association\".\n\n\"Iglesia Vida Eterna\" offers Sunday worship services in Spanish and then the joint meetings with food from Latin America.\n\nThe \"International Church of Christ\" comprises international municipalities from different nations and was founded 20 years ago in Zürich. It is also celebrating on Sunday church services.\n\n\"Kirchgemeinde Wipkingen\" is the hostess of the center for migration churches, belonging to the Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Zürich, in co-operaration with the parish \"Guthirt\". The approximately 4,500 members inter alia call the members of the parish assembly, the community convention and pastors to share the leadership responsibilities.\n"}
