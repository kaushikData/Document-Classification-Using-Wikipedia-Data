In the Middle Ages, they were known as Beja, and convoyed pilgrims from the Nile valley to Aidhab, the port of embarkation for Jeddah. From time immemorial, they have acted as guides to caravans through the Nubian desert and up the Nile valley as far as Sennar. They intermarried with the Nubians, and settled in small colonies at Shendi and elsewhere up to Muhammad Ali's conquest of the region in the early 19th century. They are still great trade carriers, and visit very distant districts.\n\n\n"}

His position was then claimed by three different Sayyids, of which one was al-Mansur an-Nasir. He was the great-great-grandson of the imam al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar bin Yahya (d. 1298). The two other competitors were al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar (d. 1474) and al-Mahdi Salah ad-Din (d. 1445). Al-Mansur an-Nasir tried to strengthen his claim by marrying the granddaughter of al-Mansur Ali. At this time, the once powerful Rasulid Dynasty in lowland Yemen was quickly crumbling, and fell altogether in 1454. The new Sunni lowland regime was the Tahiride Dynasty, which was engaged in warfare with the imam from its inception. Nevertheless, it was internal Zaidi dissention that finally toppled the position of al-Mansur an-Nasir. The important city San'a was eventually acquired by his rival al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar, later to be conquered by the Tahirides in 1462. Al-Mansur an-Nasir himself was captured by tribesmen east of Dhamar and handed over to al-Mutawakkil. He was placed in custody in Kawkaban and died there, still a prisoner, in 1462. The imamate was subsequently claimed by his son al-Mu’ayyad Muhammad.\n\n"}

He was a son of Al-Mansur al-Qasim. His rule saw the biggest territorial expansion of the Zaidiyyah imamate in Greater Yemen.\n\nAl-Mutawakkil Isma'il was the son of the founder of the Qasimid imamate, al-Mansur al-Qasim. In 1644 his elder brother al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad died. With his death, fraternal strife broke out, as several brothers competed for the imamate. In the end, the other brothers submitted to Isma'il. In Zaidi sources, his reign is portrayed in exceedingly positive terms. Yemen was restored to prosperity as the farmers enjoyed excellent harvests. His rule was considered just and incorruptible. Nevertheless, in 1648 a dispute arose between the imam and the various ulema over taxation policy. As Ismail managed to uphold public order in the deeply localized and factionalized Yemeni society, merchants ventured to visit Yemen from other countries. The coffee trade that went through Mocha had been going on for some time and gave the imam's government increased revenues.\n\nThe authority of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il expanded eastwards along the South Arabian coast. Aden had been conquered by Yemeni forces in 1644. In 1654, a struggle for the throne in the Kathiri area provided the imam with an excuse to send a sizable army into the Hadramaut. The Yafa tribesmen submitted, as did the Kathiri sultan. A further expedition in 1658 renewed the suzerainty of the imam in an area as far east as Dhofar. However, the conquest of Hadramaut resulted in a military confrontation with Sultan bin Saif, the sultan of Oman. Being in control of the seas in these areas, the Omanis were able to raid Yemen. Insecurity at sea led to a decrease in goods being imported into the Yemeni seaports.\n\nYemen in the 17th century was not a very outward-looking society, but its role as virtually the sole coffee producer of the world made it a vital link in the Indian Ocean trading system. Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il's reign saw a number of diplomatic ties with other powers around the periphery of the Indian Ocean. An Ethiopian embassy visited the imam in 1646, and a Yemeni return visit took place in the following year. With Mughal India there were likewise friendly contacts. Surat on the Indian west coast was the principal trading partner of Yemen at this time. The Ottoman Empire, which had lost control over Yemen in 1635, planned a renewed attack in 1674. However, this was abandoned over their fear of Portuguese power.\n\nAlthough he was the most resourceful of the Qasimid line, al-Mutawakkil Isma'il had to contend with the deep localism persisting in the Yemeni society, in particular among the highland tribes. Some tribes were not taxed, but on the contrary received stipends to keep quiet. This was a practice that prevailed until the 20th century. The imam himself is reputed to have lived a life of Spartan simplicity; he would sew and sell caps for his subsistence, and his household consisted of his one wife and a female slave.\n\nDuring the imam's reign, he quelled what he thought was a rebellion against the Yemeni state, led by the Jewish leader of a Sabbatean sect, Suleiman Jamal. Although the imam resided in al-Suda, he was informed by the governor of Sana'a about the man's actions (i.e. he had tried to usurp authority) and the man was immediately sentenced to die. The imam then made it more difficult for his Jewish subjects by confiscating their property and by prohibiting them from owning land.\n\nAl-Mutawakkil Isma'il died in 1676, and a dispute arose between two of his nephews over the succession. Of these, al-Mahdi Ahmad finally succeeded to the imamate.\n\n"}

They speak a Nilo-Saharan language that is not related to those of their Nilo-Saharan neighbors (Gumuz, Uduk). Their total Ethiopian population is about 183,000 people.\n\nTheir origins are to be found in eastern Sudan, in the area of the former Funj sultanate of Sinnar (1521-1804). During the 16th or 17th century, they migrated to western Ethiopia, in the area of the modern Benishangul-Gumuz Region. \"Benishangul\" is an Arabicized form of the original name \"Bela Shangul\", meaning \"Rock of Shangul\". This refers to a sacred stone located in a mountain in the Menge woreda, one of the places where the Berta originally settled when they arrived to Ethiopia.\n\nTheir arrival in Ethiopia was marked by strong territorial conflict among the diverse shangul communities. For this reason, and for protecting themselves from slave raids coming from Sudan, the shangul communities decided to establish their villages in naturally-defended hills and mountains, amidst rocky outcrops. Due to this harsh topography, houses and granaries were raised over stone pillars. German traveler Ernst Marno described shangul architecture and villages in his \"Reisen im Gebiete des Blauen und Weissen Nil\" (Vienna, 1874). The shangul of Benishangul were incorporated into Ethiopia only in 1896.\n\nAfter conflicts and raids receded during the 20th century, the Shangul people moved to the valleys, where their villages are located today. During the 19th century, the area of Benishangul was divided in several sheikhdoms (Fadasi, Komosha, Gizen, Asosa), the most powerful of which was ruled by Sheikh Khoyele at the end of the 19th century.\n\nAfter several centuries of Arab Sudanese influence, the Berta are now mostly Muslim and many speak fluent Arabic. Due to their intermarriage with Arab traders, some Berta were called \"Watawit\" -the local name for \"bat\", meaning that they were a mix of two very different groups. However, they still have traditional customs that are similar to those of their Nilo-Saharan neighbors. For example, there still exist ritual specialists called \"neri\", who have healing and divination powers. They are the ones who know how to deal with evil spirits (\"shuman\"). Rain-making rituals are also found among the Berta, as among other Nilo-Saharan and Nilotic communities.\n\nIn their wedding ceremonies music is played by males with large calabash trumpets (\"was'a\"). The groom arrives to the wedding on a donkey and carrying a \"bang\" (throwing stick) in his hand. After the wedding, the husband has to build a hut and live in his wife's village for a year or more, tilling their father-in-law's land. Divorce is accepted. The Berta decorate their faces with scarifications, usually three vertical lines on each cheek, which they consider to be symbols of God (each line is interpreted as the initial letter of Allah, the Arabic \"alif\").\n\nThe Berta are slash-and-burn agriculturalists. Their staple food is sorghum, with which they make porridge in ceramic vessels. They also make beer with sorghum. Beer is prepared in large ceramic containers called \"awar\" and \"is'u\". Working parties play an important role in Berta society. When somebody wants to build a house or cultivate a field, he calls his neighbors for help and provides beer and food.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29456262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29456262", "title": "Buru people", "text": "Buru people\n\nBuru people () is an ethnic group mostly living on Indonesian island Buru, as well as on some other Maluku Islands. They also call themselves Gebfuka or Gebemliar, which literally means \"people of the world\" or \"people of the land\". Buru people are related to the eastern Indonesian anthropological group and from an ethnographic point of view are similar to other indigenous peoples of the island Buru. They speak Buru language.\n\nAbout 33,000 of 35,000 Buru people live on the island of Buru; they make about a quarter of the island population (about 135,000 as of 2009) and are the most numerous ethnicity of Buru; about 2,000 live on Ambon Island and several hundred are scattered over other islands in the Indonesian province of Maluku and the capital Jakarta. There is a small Buru community in the Netherlands formed by the descendants of the soldiers of Republic of South Moluccas () who moved there after the accession of this self-proclaimed state in Indonesia in 1950.\n\nBuru people are evenly spread over Buru island, except for some parts of the northern coast and the central mountainous part which is sparsely populated. Their relative fraction is somewhat lower in the towns, such as Namrole and Namlea, owing to inflow of people of other Indonesian ethnicities. In the initial period of the Dutch colonization of the island in the middle of the 17th century, much of the tribal nobility of Buru was moved to the eastern part and later became one of the components in the ethnogenesis of ethnic Kayeli people. Several ethnic groups are distinguished within Buru people, which differ in lifestyle and language specifics – \"Rana\" (14,258 people mainly in the central part of the island), Masarete (about 9,600 people mainly in the south), Wae Sama (6,622 people mostly in the south-east) and Fogi (about 500 people in the west).\n\nThe nation speaks Buru language, which belongs to the Central Maluku branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages. Three dialects are distinguished according to the major ethnic groups of Rana, Masarete and Wae Sama. In addition, some 3,000–5,000 of Rana people along with their main dialect use the so-called \"secret dialect\" \"Ligahan\". The western dialect \"Fogi\" is now extinct. Lexical differences between the dialects are relatively small: about 90% between Masarete and Wae Sama, 88% between Masarete and Rana and 80% between Wae Sama and Rana. Apart from native vernaculars, most Buru people, especially in the coastal regions and towns have command of the official language of the country, Indonesian. The coastal population also uses the Ambonese language, which is a creolized form of Malay with additions of the local lexicon.\n\nReligiously, Buru people are divided into comparable fractions of Sunni Muslims, who mostly live in the north of the island, and Christians-Protestants in the south. Remnants of traditional local beliefs persist almost everywhere, and in the central areas of the island many openly profess the cult of the supreme deity \"Opo Hebe Snulat\" and his messenger \"Nabiat\". The economical crisis of the 1990s resulted in frequent conflicts among Buru people over religious grounds. So within a few days in December 1999, 43 people were killed and at least 150 houses burned in the Wainibe village.\n\nMost Buru people are engaged in farming rice, millet, sago, sweet potato and various spice, such as allspice, nutmeg and Eucalyptus tree, which is used for aromatic oil. In the inland areas, they also hunt the wild pig Buru babirusa, deer and possum, and take part in tuna fishing on the coast. In the urban areas, the growing number of Buru people take jobs in the industrial enterprises. Traditional Buru houses are made from bamboo, often on stilts. The roofs are covered with palm leaves or reeds, with tiles becoming progressively popular. Traditional Buru clothing is similar that of many other Indonesia peoples. Men wear sarong (a kind of kilt) and a long-skirted tunic, and women are dressed in sarong and a shorter jacket. However, the colors and decor items differ quite substantially among Masarete, Wae Sama and Rana. Traditional Buru weapons are straight machete (parang) and a short spear. In the past, Buru hunters were famed for their spear throwing skills. Buru people, along with the Muslim or Christian names, also use traditional ones, the most common being Lesnussa, Latbual, Nurlatu, Lehalima, Wael and Sigmarlatu.\n\n"}

They are closely related to the Laha, Qabiao, Gelao, and Lachi. The Buyang language is spoken, although many Buyang are now shifting to Zhuang and Southwestern Mandarin. In Yunnan, the Buyang are classified by the Chinese government as Zhuang, while they are classified as Yao in Guangxi (Li 2006).\n\nThe name Buyang comes from the Zhuang \"pu22 jaaŋ24\" (alternatively \"pu22 ȵaaŋ24\"), which means \"other people.\" The Buyang of Napo County, Guangxi call themselves the \"ʔia33 hrɔŋ53\", while Guangnan Buyang call themselves \"pa33 ha33\". In Napo and Jingxi counties, many Zhuang are called \"Buyang\" by other Zhuang groups. In southeastern Guizhou and Tianlin, Longlin, and Xilin counties of Guangxi, many villages also contain the word \"yang\" 央, suggesting that those villages may be formerly Buyang-speaking areas that had been assimilated by the Zhuang people.\n\nThe Buyang of Guangnan County and Funing County are officially classified as Zhuang, while those in Napo County are classified as Yao. This is because Buyang clothing appears similar to Yao clothing, and many Zhuangs and Hans have mistaken the Buyang as Yao and have called them:\n\n\nThe Buyang of Napo County are also called the Liu Yao 六瑶 (\"Six Yao\") because they used to live in six villages (Li & Luo 2010). According to the \"Napo County Almanac\" (那坡县志), this exonym dates back to the Qing Dynasty, when the \"Six Yao\" lived in the villages of Nianyi 念益, Guolie 果列, Yancun 燕村, Rongtun 荣屯, Gonghe 共和, and Shanhe 善合.\n\nTraditional Buyang clothing resembles that of the Gelao and Lachi peoples, although many have now switched to Zhuang-style clothing. Today, most Buyang celebrate Zhuang festivals, although the Guangnan Buyang (or Paha) celebrate the Dragon-Worshiping Festival and the Yin Day, or New Year, Festival.\n\nThe Buyang people may have originally migrated to their present locations in Yunnan and Guangxi from Guizhou province in the north, which is now occupied by the Gelao people. Various types of historical evidence suggest that the Buyang were much more populous in the past. For instance, many village names in Xilin County, Longlin County, and Napo County begin with Yāng (央 or 秧), suggesting that they may have formerly been Buyang-speaking areas from at least the Qing Dynasty. Today, the dominant languages in these areas are Bouyei and Yang Zhuang. Li (1999) states that the following counties were formerly inhabited by Buyang speakers, but no longer have any:\n\n\nThe majority resided in the Hongshui River (Hongshui He 红水河) valley. Today, the river serves as a border between northwestern Guangxi and southwestern Guizhou.\n\nA legend among the Buyang of Guangxi recounts that once there were three Buyang brothers living in poverty. One stayed in Guangxi, another went to Yunnan to escape poverty, and yet another migrated to northern Vietnam. The third brother who migrated to Vietnam could have been the ancestor of the En (Nung Ven) or the Qabiao people.\n\nA Qing-era chronicle had also mentioned a people called the Puyang 普央 living in Guangnan (Li & Luo 2010).\n\nAccording to Holm (2003:15), the Buyang used to build hanging coffins, including hanging coffins on cliffs above a large bend in the Hongshui River near Banwen village 板文村, Sihe Township 四合乡, Donglan County, Guangxi.\n\nHolm (2003:159-160) reports that the Buyang continue to exist in the legends of the Zhuang people of Donglan County, Guangxi and the Buyi people of Xingyi, Guizhou.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41681646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41681646", "title": "Chindu Bhagavatham", "text": "Chindu Bhagavatham\n\nChindu Bhagavatam is a drama type art which is very near to Yakshaganam and this is widely performed in Telangana, India. The art form has evolved over time from being restricted to a small sub-sect within a community to being performed all over the region and utilised by the State government.\n\nThe art goes that within the ‘Madiga’ community, a sect considered itself ‘Pedda Madiga’ (Big madiga) and another sect that was living on begging, performing yakshaganas, as ‘Chinna Madigas’, (Small madiga). These Chindu Bhagavatas were not permitted to perform beyond their own community. A lot has changed since then. Chindu Yellamma, a respected icon from Nizamabad, was invited to perform with her troupe at Ravindra Bharathi by the erstwhile Dance Academy headed by Nataraja Ramakrishna. The academy had also published a small booklet on this art and the Chindu Bhagavatas at that time. \n\nThe word ‘Chindu’ in Telugu means ‘jump’. As their presentation is interspersed with leaps and jumps, it gained the name of Chindu Bhagavatam. Most of the stories narrated are from ‘Bhagavatam’. Gaddam Sammayya, a leader of these troupes, claims that though the Chindu Bhagavatas were seen as a lowly section of society, they trace their origin to Jamba Mahamuni, and believe their clan is the most ancient sect. “Hence most of our dramas open with 'Jamba Puranam' with the opening pallavi that goes ‘Ekkuvani Mari Palukabokumura, Ekkuvevvaru Mari Telisi Palukumura’ (don’t speak of being high, speak knowing who is higher),” he says.\n\nContemporary plays based on the Bhagavata were passed down generations orally until writers like Chevirala Bhagayya, Jilla Venkatadasu, Burugupally Venkatanarasayya Panthulu, Yadavadasu wrote some plays on new themes, made the script more sophisticated, adding some verses to meter thus making it a full-fledged theatrical performance. “Some of us are educated up to ‘Peddabalasiksha’ and can read the script and memorise it,” Sammayya informs.\n\nCurrently there are 800 Chindu Bhagavatam troupes , each troupe is made skilled performers , typically all male. Everyone is trained in the art of make up, singing and playing musical instruments like harmonium, cymbals and Dholak. Sammayya says every family of their caste gets trained in the Yakshagana prakriya. “We spend our lives in learning and staging many mythological themes. Believe us, we are armed with more than 300 themes,” he claims. They learn to render songs and verses and verbal dramatic bits. All skill performers are in Yakshagana format. The stage for them is any special place in a village - be it under trees or at cross roads. People come in large numbers to watch. Sometimes they present ‘Gadies’ of Deshmukhs or ‘Chavadi Kottaalu’ you find in rural areas in the Telangana region. Plays run throughout the night till dawn. Makeup is done on the spot.\n\nThey keep a picture of Goddess Yellamma before them and move around the villages to collect whatever the villagers give, be they clothes or food. Generally they avoid performances in monsoon season. When not performing, they work as farm labour or do fishing and rope making. Thanks to the Government’s developmental and welfare programmes, the services of Chindu Bhagavatas are borrowed to propagate programmes like protection of environment, sanitation, family planning, literacy, awareness of TB, AIDS and so on. They incorporate these messages as a part of the Yakshaganam to make them entertaining, says Sammayya. “We are able to survive because of the remuneration government gives us for this”, he says.\nThe State Culture Council and department of Culture have promised to give pension to old and indigent artistes of Chindu Bhagavatulu and also send these troupes to other parts of the state. However, the immediate help they can render is to fund for their costumes and accessories. However they plead for houses as part of ‘Gruha Samaudaya Pathakam’ (group housing\nscheme) in different mandals in the Telangana region.\n"}

They include 133,000 Arab Christians who are mostly adherents of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church (about 60% of Israeli Christians) or the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, as well as Latin Rite Catholics, with small numbers of Maronites, Arameans, Copts, and Protestants, about 25,000 Orthodox Christians from the former Soviet Union (Russian Orthodox) and smaller minorities of Assyrians and Armenians. A certain number of Israelis also practice Messianic Judaism—usually considered a syncretist form of Christianity, with estimates of several thousands, but exact numbers of such are not available.\n\nAbout 80% of Christian residents of Israel are Arab Christians, who are historically bound with neighbouring Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian Christians. A community of 1,000 Coptic Christians also exists in Israel, being registered as \"Arab Christians\", though their Arab identity is disputed. Christian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in Israel. \"Maariv\" has described the Christian Arabs sector as \"the most successful in the education system\", since Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel. Some 25,000 (the majority of the remaining) are immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who immigrated with Jewish relatives due to mixed marriages; there are also smaller ethnoreligious affiliations of about 7,000 Maronites (some of whom are recorded in Israel as \"Arab Christians\" and others as \"Aramean Christians\") and 1,000 Assyrians.\n\nThere are approximately 300 Christians who have converted from Islam according to one 2014 estimate, and most of them are part of the Roman Catholic church.\n\nTen Christian churches are formally recognized under Israel's confessional system, for the self-regulation and state recognition of status issues, such as marriage and divorce: the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Armenian Catholic Church, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Episcopal Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Latin Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Syriac Maronite Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church. However, the practice of religion is free, with no restrictions on the practice of other denominations.\n\nAccording to historical and traditional sources, Jesus lived in Roman Judea, and died and was buried on the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City Jerusalem making the area a Holy Land for Christianity. However, few Christians now live in the region, compared to Muslims and Jews. This is mainly because Islam displaced Christianity throughout the Middle East, and the rise of modern Zionism and the establishment of the State of Israel has seen millions of Jews emigrate to Israel.\n\nThe Christian population in Israel has increased significantly with the immigration of many mixed families from the former Soviet Union (1989-late 1990s) and by the influx of some 10,000 Christian Maronites from Lebanon in 2000. Recently a further increase in Christianity came with arrival of many foreign workers and asylum seekers, some of Christian background (for instance from the Philippines and South Sudan). As a result, numerous churches have opened in Tel Aviv.\n\nAs of December 2013, about 161,000 Israeli citizens practiced Christianity, together comprising about 2% of the total population. The largest group consists of Melkites (about 60% of Israel's Christians), followed by the Greek Orthodox (about 30%), with the remaining ca. 10% spread between the Roman Catholic (Latin), Maronite, Anglican, Lutheran, Armenian, Syriac, Ethiopian, Coptic and other denominations. \n\nSix of the particular churches of the Catholic Church have jurisdiction within Israel: the Latin Church (the dominant Catholic church worldwide), the Armenian Catholic Church, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, and the Syriac Maronite Church. 60% of Christians in Israel are Melkites. \n\nA large portion of Christians in Israel are adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church. There are two Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical jurisdictions on the territory of Israel: Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem (covering central and southern regions) and Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch (covering only the most northern region). Eastern Orthodox Christians in Israel have many churches, monasteries, seminaries, and other religious institutions all over the land, particularly in Jerusalem.\n\nOriental Orthodoxy in Israel is represented mainly by adherents of Armenian Apostolic Church, represented by Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and adherents of Syriac Orthodox Church, headed by archbishop Mor Severius Malke Mourad, patriarchal exarch of Jerusalem.\n\nThere has been a small Protestant community in Israel since the foundation of the state in 1948, who are either Christian Arabs who had changed their religious affiliation to Protestant teachings or European residents moving to the area.\n\nThe Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East is a province of the Anglican Communion. The seat of the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem is St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem. Other prominent Episcopal churches in Israel include Christ Church, Jerusalem, built in 1849, which is inside the Jaffa Gate of the contested Old City of Jerusalem, and Christ Church, Nazareth, built in 1871, both built during the Ottoman period.\n\nJewish Christians are not considered bona-fide Jews under Israel's Law of Return (see Oswald Rufeisen).\n\nThe Hebrew Christian movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries consisted of Jews who converted to Christianity as a result of Protestant missionary activity. It was incorporated into the later parallel Messianic Jewish movement in the late 1960s.\n\nThe number of Messianic Jews in Israel is estimated at around 20,000.\n\nIn Jerusalem, there are twelve Messianic congregations. On 23 February 2007, Israel Channel 2 News released a news documentary about the growing number of Messianic Jews in Israel.\n\nHebrew-speakers call Christians as \"Notzri\" (also romanized \"Notsri\"), which means Nazarene (originated from Nazareth). The word is cognate to the Arabic \"Nasrani\".\n\nIsrael's Declaration of Independence, issued in 1948, describes the country as a Jewish state but clearly extends religious freedoms to all of its inhabitants by stating that the State of Israel will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions.\n\nDuring the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the fate of the Christian Palestinians was similar to that of the Muslims, in term of military administration and land confiscations. However, Christian churches generally avoided destruction or defilement during the 1948/1949 Arab-Israeli War. Aware of the international attention to the conflict, David Ben-Gurion is said to have expressly forbidden to loot or defile holy places. For the same reason, Israeli authorities have a more lenient attitude to the right of return of the Christian refugees.\n\nAccording to Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the reunification of Jerusalem, the Christian as well as Jewish and Islamic holy sites were opened for multinational pilgrims by the Israeli authorities, for the first time since 1948, when the Kingdom of Jordan took over the Eastern half of the city.\n\nAs of 2013, the Government - Christians Forum was formed in Jerusalem, Israel, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Public Security, to address the concerns of the Christian leaders and representatives in Israel, and in order to empower the relations between the government and Christian leaders and representatives in Israel.\n\nSome ultra-Orthodox Jews have been accused of having a decades-old practice of cursing and spitting on Christian clergymen in Jerusalem, and there have been cases where churches and cemeteries were defaced by price taggers. When the doors of the Latrun Trappist monastery were set aflame and the phrase \"Jesus was a monkey\" was painted on its walls, the Vatican reacted with a rare official complaint against the Israeli government's inaction. In June 2015, the Church of the Multiplication was significantly damaged by an arson attack and defaced by Hebrew graffiti, with the words \"the false gods will be eliminated\" (quoted from the Aleinu prayer). This attack was labelled as \"terrorism\" by Israeli officials.\n\nGabriel Naddaf argues that Israel is the only country in which Christian communities have been able to thrive in the Middle East. However, there has also been criticism by Palestinian Christians of this claim, with such statements being called a \"manipulation\" of the facts. Members of the Palestinian Christian community claim that such statements attempt to hide the discrimination that Arab Christians face within Israel due to alleged discrimination against Arabs as well as the effect of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza on the Christian population in these areas.\n\nRecently, there has been a steady undercurrent of Christian Arabs who seek deeper integration into Israeli society. Under the leadership of Greek Orthodox priest Gabriel Naddaf, the \"Sons of the New Testament\" is a political party that advocates Christian enlistment in the IDF and a more distinct societal separation of Christians from Muslims. This separation is partly based on the purported fact that Christians in Israel are not technically Arabs, seeing as they were present in the holy land long before the Arab conquest, hallmarked by the Siege of Jerusalem. This distinction is in the process of being formalized into law, as the Likud government is currently drafting legislation to grant this request.\n\nThis new attitude is founded largely by the perception by some that only in Israel the Christian population is growing due to natural increase and no state persecution, seeing the entire Middle East, except Lebanon, as where Christianity is and has been rapidly on the decline. In addition, increasing numbers of Christian leaders and community members are pointing to Muslim violence as a threat to their way of life in Arab majority cities and towns. Sons of the New Testament as a party and a national movement has been met with wide admiration from the Jews of Israel, harshly negative scorn from the Muslim Arabs, and mixed reactions from the Christians themselves. Because of Israel's parliamentary system where each party must attain at least 2% of the popular vote, Sons of the New Testament must be supported by non-Christians to enter the Knesset.\n\nIn 2008, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of Efrat, established the Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation or CJCUC, the first Orthodox Jewish institution to dialogue with the Christian world on a religious and theological basis. The center, currently located in Jerusalem, engages in Hebraic Bible Study for Christians, from both the local community and from abroad, has organized numerous interfaith praise initiatives, such as \"Day to Praise\", and has established many fund-raising initiatives such as \"Blessing Bethlehem\" which aim to aid the persecuted Christian community of Bethlehem, in part, and the larger persecuted Christian community of the Middle East region and throughout the world.\n\nA recent survey indicated that Christians in Israel are prosperous and well-educated – but some fear that Muslim intimidation will cause a mass escape to the West.\n\nRecently there has been an increase of anti-Christian incidents in the Nazareth area, inspired by the rise of Jihadist forces in the Middle East. Many Christians have complained of being targeted by Muslims, whom they believe are trying to either drive them out of cities that have traditionally had large Christian populations, or to \"persuade\" them to convert. In 1999, for example, radical Muslims in Nazareth rioted as they attempted to wrest land from a major Christian shrine to build a mosque. In one incident during 2014, a flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was installed in front of a church in Nazareth.\n\nThere has also been increasing incitement and violence by the Muslims against Christians who voice their support for the Israel Defense Forces. In a recent case, the son of Gabriel Naddaf, a prominent Eastern Orthodox priest who is regarded as being pro-Israel, was severely beaten. Nadaf himself has been suffering from vasts amount of Muslim incitement in recent years.\n\nA 2015 study estimates some 300 Christians from a Muslim background in Israel.\n\nA 2016 study by Pew research points to the convergence of political views of both Muslims and Christians over issues like – Israel cannot be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time (Christians: 72%; Muslims: 63%), US being too supportive of Israel (Christians: 86%; Muslims: 75%), Israeli government not making enough efforts to make peace with Palestine (Christians: 80%; Muslims: 72%).\n\nAccording to the study \"Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel\" by Hanna David from the University of Tel Aviv, one of the factors why Arab Christians are the most educated segment of Israel's population is the high level of the Christian educational institutions. Christian schools in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools, and about 87% of the Israeli Arabs in the high tech sector have been educated in Christian schools. A 2011 Maariv article described the Christian Arab sector as \"the most successful in the education system\", an opinion supported by others who point out that Christian Arabs fared best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel. \n\nThe Israel Central Bureau of Statistics noted that when taking into account the data recorded over the years, Christian Arabs fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel. In 2016 Christian Arabs had the highest rates of success at matriculation examinations, namely 73.9%, both in comparison to Muslim and Druze Israelis (41% and 51.9% respectively), and to the students from the different branches of the Hebrew (majority Jewish) education system considered as one group (55.1%).\n\nChristian Arabs are one of the most educated groups in Israel. Statistically, Christian Arabs in Israel have the highest rates of educational attainment among all religious communities, according to a data by Israel Central Bureau of Statistics in 2010, 63% of Christian Arabs have had college or postgraduate education, the highest of any religious group. Despite the fact that Arab Christians only represent 2.1% of the total Israeli population, in 2014 they accounted for 17.0% of the country's university students, and for 14.4% of its college students. The percentage of Arab Christian women who are receiving higher education is also higher than that of other groups. There are more Christians who have attained a bachelor's degree or higher academic degrees than the median Israeli population.\n\nThe rate of students studying in the field of medicine was higher among Christian Arab students than that of all other sectors.\n\nIn 2013, Arab Christian students were also the vanguard in terms of eligibility for higher education, as the Christian Arab students had the highest rates of receiving Psychometric Entrance Test scores which make them eligible for acceptance into universities, data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics show that 61% of Christian Arabs were eligible for university studies, compared to 50% of Jewish, 45% of Druze, and 35% of Muslim students.\n\nIn terms of their socio-economic situation, Arab Christians are more similar to the Jewish population than to the Muslim Arab population. They have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment which is 4.9% compared to 6.5% among Jewish men and women. They have also the highest median household income among Arab citizens of Israel and second highest median household income among the Israeli ethno-religious groups. Also Arab Christians have a high presentation in science and in the white collar professions. In Israel, Arab Christians are portrayed as a hard-working and upper-middle-class educated ethno-religious minority.\n\nChristians in Israel, overall, are more religious than Israeli Jews and Druze, for example, about (57%) of Christians in Israel say religion is very important in their lives. A third of Christians say they pray daily (34%) and roughly the same (38%) report that they go to a church at least once a week. Israeli Christians also are more likely than Jews and Druze to participate in weekly worship services. Nearly (94%) of Israeli Christians believe in God, including (79%) who say they are absolutely certain.\n\n60% of Christians in Israel fast during Lent, Majorities of Christians also said they have icons of saints or other holy figures in their home (81%) and that they have been anointed with holy oil (83%). According to Pew Research Center 2015 survey, Found a majority of Israeli Christians (89%), say the Bible is the word of God, This includes 65% who say the Bible should be taken literally. 33% of Christians believe that Jesus will return during their lifetime, which was similar to the number of Muslims who held that belief (33%). \nWhen surveyed in 2015, a majority of Christians were not comfortable with their child marrying outside of the faith.\n\nChristians in Israel (97%) are more likely than Jews, Muslims, and Druze to say they are proud of their identity. Overall, about (89%) of say they have a strong sense of belonging to the Christian community. Around (66%) of Christians in Israel say they have a special responsibility to help fellow members of their religious group who are in need around the world.\n\nThe nature of Christian identity varies among Christians as well. Christians in Israel are about evenly divided among those who say their identity is mainly a matter of religion (31%), those who say being Christian is mainly about ancestry and/or culture (34%) and those who say their identity is characterized by a combination of religion and ancestry/culture (34%).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31957938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31957938", "title": "Femminiello", "text": "Femminiello\n\nFemminielli or femmenielli (singular femminiello, cf. Standard Italian \"femmina\", \"a female\", \"-ello\", masculine diminutive suffix) is a term used to refer to a population of homosexual males with markedly feminine gender expression in traditional Neapolitan culture. It may be hard to define this term within modern Western notions of \"gay men\" versus \"trans women\" since both these categories overlap to a degree in the case of \"femminielli\" (see Third gender). This term is not derogatory and does not carry a stigma; instead \"femminielli\" are traditionally believed to bring luck. Ironically Achille della Ragione suggests that recent surveys have shown that Neapolitans have a generally negative view of what he calls \"the politically correct model of homosexuality of a hypocritical do-gooder society\" (implying the mainstream Western gay culture), yet he contrasts \"femminielli\" as enjoying a favorable attitude from the part of Neapolitan society.\n\nIt is reductive to insert the Neapolitan Femminiello within the macro-category of transgender usually adopted in Anglo-Saxon and North American contexts. \"The alternative identity of femminielli is possible from a transformed, disguised, and transfigured body, a complex phenomenon that could be considered 'endemic', and is peculiarly linked to the territory and the population of the city\". The femminiello, instead, could be considered as a peculiar gender expression, despite a widespread sexual binarism. The cultural roots of this phenomenon are embedded in confer to the femminiello a cultural and even socially legitimized status. For the historical and symbolic coordinates of Naples, the identity construct of the femminiello is not superimposable to more common European and euro-centric transgender clusters.\n\nIn late 2000s many sex scandals have rocked Italy involving high-profile politicians (e.g., former President of Lazio, Piero Marrazzo) and transsexual sex workers often of Latin American descent, who are usually referred to as \"transessuali\" (shortened to \"trans\") in Italian media. In 2009 the term \"femminiello\" gained some notoriety in Italian media after a Naples native \"femminiello\" Camorra mobster Ketty Gabriele (legal name Ugo Gabriele) was arrested. Gabriele had engaged in prostitution prior to becoming a capo. Gabriele has been referred to both as a \"femminiello\" and \"transessuale\" or \"trans\" in Italian media.\n\nHowever others maintain that \"i femminielli\" are decidedly male despite their female gender role, saying that \"they are male; they know it and everyone else knows it.\" Achille della Ragione has written of social aspects of \"femminielli\". \"[The \"femminiello\"] is usually the youngest male child, 'mother's little darling,' ... he is useful, he does chores, runs errands and watches the kids.\"\n\nZito and Eugenio propose in their study that the femminielli \"seem to confirm, in the field of gender identity, the postmodern idea of continuous modulation between the masculine and the feminine against their dichotomy.\"\n\nA certain incompatibility between the notions of \"femminiello\" and (often foreign-born) transsexuals can be observed, e.g., a news headline reading \"Rivolta ai quartieri Spagnoli: i femminielli cacciano le trans\" (\"Revolt in the Quartieri Spagnoli: \"femminielli\" drive out the transsexuals.\")\n\nThe constant references in many sources to the ancient rituals behind the presence of the \"femminiello\" in Naples require little comment. The links to ancient Greek mythology are numerous: for example, Hermaphroditus, who possessed the beauty of the mother, Aphrodite, and the strength of the father, Hermes; or Tiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes, famous for being transformed into a woman for seven years. Both of these personages and, indeed, others in many cultures in the world are presumed to possess something that others do not: the wise equilibrium that comes from knowing both worlds, masculine and feminine.\n\nA ceremony called the \"matrimonio dei femminielli\" takes place in Torre Annunziata on Easter Monday, a parade of \"femminielli\" dressed in wedding gowns and accompanied by a \"husband\" travel through the streets in horse-drawn carriages.\n\nThe \"femminiello\" in Campania, enjoy a relatively privileged position thanks to their participation in some traditional events, such as \"Candelora al Santuario di Montevergine\" (Candlemas at the Sanctuary of Montevergine) in Avellino or the \"Tammurriata\", a traditional dance performed at the feast of Madonna dell'Arco in Sant'Anastasia.\n\nGenerally \"femminielli\" are considered good luck. For this reason, it is popular in the neighborhoods for a \"femminiello\" to hold a newborn baby, or participate in games such as bingo. Above all the Tombola or \"Tombolata dei femminielli\", this is a popular game performed every year on the 2nd of February, as the conclusive part of the Candlemas at the Sanctuary of Montevergine.\n\nIn a stage production called \"La Gatta Cenerentola\" (The Cat Cinderella), by Roberto De Simone, \"femmenielli\" play the roles of several important characters. Among the major scenes in this respect are the \"rosario dei femmenielli\" and \"il suicidio del femminiella\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20483911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20483911", "title": "Gender roles in agriculture", "text": "Gender roles in agriculture\n\nGender roles in agriculture are a frequent subject of study by sociologists and farm economists. Historians also study them, as they are important in understanding the social structure of agrarian, and even industrial, societies. Agriculture provides lots of job opportunities and livelihoods around the world. It can also reflect gender inequality and uneven distribution of resources and privileges among  gender. According to the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, women are usually harder to obtain land, tools and knowledge than men, especially in developing countries. Several organizations such as FAO or research also indicated that increasing gender corporation can bring more profits and food security for the community. \n\nThe \"classical\" farm gender roles in the United States, although varying somewhat from region to region, were generally based on a division of labor in which men participated in \"field\" tasks (animal care, plowing, harvesting crops, using farm machinery, etc.), while most women participated primarily in \"farmhouse\" tasks (preparing and preserving food and feedstuffs, and maintaining the farm compound).\n\nAccording to agro-historian Jane Adams, the middle 20th century brought a change in which the centralization of agriculture eliminated many of the tasks considered part of the \"female\" role. This changed the perception of women from being active \"housekeepers\" to passive \"homemakers\". Some began working off the farm, or joined their husbands in fieldwork, but the majority, per Dr. Adams, simply became more like urban housewives. This trend continued until the 1980s farm crisis, in which economic downturns obliged many of them to take jobs off-farm.\n\nGender roles in Canadian agriculture vary greatly according to the region and community.\n\nAlberta, and particularly Southern Alberta, has traditionally had highly defined gender roles similar to the late 19th-century United States. Men worked together and women worked together, but there were few tasks in which both men and women participated together. On most Alberta farms up until the 1970s, decisions about matters such as planning and insurance were done by fiat of the husband, rather than by joint venture of husband and wife. Some writers have considered Alberta's highly gendered division of farm life to be not only inefficient from an agricultural standpoint, but deleterious to the integrity of marriage relationships as well.\n\nIn the agricultural tradition of Central Canada there is an emphasis on conjugal (husband-and-wife) collaboration. Major decisions are normally made together, with each spouse having equal decisive power. When extended families live and farm together, couples within the extended family are considered as working \"units\". This style of family farm management is rather common in the rest of Canada as well.\n\nQuebec agriculture is based on the historic seigneurial system, vestiges of which exist today in the organized district system. Gender roles are sometimes more pronounced in areas where the Catholic influence is strong.\n\nIn Southern Ontario the history of agricultural gender roles parallels that of the U.S.A. almost precisely.\n\nBesides these regional generalities, traditions vary among different ethnic and religious communities, such as First Nations (aboriginal), Anabaptist, or historic immigrant settlements.\n\nAcross Canada, and also in the United States, the assignment of roles tends to be more egalitarian on organic and Certified Naturally Grown farms than on \"conventional\" ones.\n\nAgricultural society in what is now the C.I.S. goes back thousands of years, and entails numerous distinct cultures. Slavonic-speaking societies tended to follow the general Indo-European pattern of patrilineality, passing down property and rights from father to son. In agriculture this meant land and livestock. The gender roles on the farm presumed that the farm and all its contents belonged to the father or grandfather. Uralic-speaking societies, on the other hand, had a relatively egalitarian system in which land was considered to be the domain of a larger extended family or folk group, without rigid boundaries between individual homesteads. Division of labour was not rigid, and spouses often worked alongside each other, or helped each other with various tasks.\n\nDuring the Russian Empire period, Slavonic patriarchy was emphasized and promoted to a greater extent across the board. This was especially the case in southern and central Russia during the 18th and 19th centuries, where every farmer or farm labourer was considered to hold a position in the feudal hierarchy of the Empire, until this system was modified in the later 19th century. Men were the official landowners and decision-makers, though women often had a significant amount of unofficial influence in decision-making (on the free peasant farmsteads).\n\nIn the years leading up to the Revolution, as the remnants of feudalism disintegrated, many Russian farm families joined \"artels\" (артели), or cooperatives. The cooperatives practised (at least in theory) equal consideration of men's and women's opinions in making collective decisions, which was a sharp contrast to the feudal method. Moreover, as the Empire became more connected by rail and road, the rural residents of central and southern Russia gained knowledge of Uralic-based farm operation systems (which had survived in the north and east). These northern and eastern traditions contributed to the emerging cooperative practices.\n\nAfter the Revolution, the government was initially supportive toward the artel movement (since it is \"collectivist\"). When the Stalinist government took power, however, many of the artels were superseded by state farm units (\"sovkhozy\" or Совхоэӣ) under control of the central government. The effect on gender roles varied: workers of both sexes were assigned to do similar tasks, but managers and overseers were mostly male, though there was no fixed rule or custom that established this as absolute. Fieldworkers often worked in mixed-gender teams, though in the Caucasian and Middle Asian republics an informal segregation by sex was maintained, following local (and ultimately Islamic) traditions. Throughout the Union, state-farm administrators tended to have little regard for marital relationships: marriage was considered part of the workers' personal lives, which needed not enter into the world of economic labour. Children born or conceived on a state farm were considered \"bound\" to it, in a concept lent from feudalism.\n\nLater governments, from Krushchev's onward, eased the central control of farms, though certain republics (such as Tajikistan) took up this control into their own state governments, and retain much of it even to this day.\n\nWith the 1960s loosening of central administration over agriculture, the cooperative system became once again the main system of large-scale farmland operations in much of the U.S.S.R. This condition has remained ever since, with only minor changes.\n\nWhere small and extended family farms exist in the C.I.S., consensus is often a major mode of decision-making, and cooperation a major mode of work. On collective farms as well, conjugal collaboration is a respected and encouraged part of the overall dynamic, and couples often work as units within the larger framework. Exceptions include the Chechenya/Dagestan/Naxcivan region, where all areas of life are highly sex-segregated, and marriage is often an arranged contract by the parents.\n\nFinnish agriculture tends to follow a modern form of what is recognizably the Uralic system, though the influence of western Europe (particularly in Finland's west half) has brought a greater consciousness of private property. Conjugal collaboration and joint venture are major characteristics of the Finnish farming tradition.\n\nIn Mexico, the most important crop has been and still is maize. It is the main ingredient in tortillas, which is a staple in Mexican cuisine. Additionally, for many Mexicans, especially those living in rural farming communities, maize symbolizes the origin of life. Women, therefore, are usually the ones responsible for tending the maize crops, although it is not unusual for a man to farm the maize.\n\nAlthough women have traditionally been responsible for the entire tortilla process, from farming the maize to grinding the maize into flour and cooking the tortillas, this takes a substantial amount of time. Because of this, recently some women have been purchasing bags of tortilla flour or even pre-made tortillas in local markets to better fit their busy lifestyle. This has been controversial among individuals living in rural communities, as many people see the tortilla making process as having high importance in the traditions of their culture.\n\nAnother recent controversy in Mexico has to do with the type of maize being grown and consumed. Maíz criollo, or landrace maize, is the most common type of maize grown in Mexico, although recently genetically modified crops are becoming more widespread. In a focus group meeting conducted among Mexican farmers, the men tended to feel that the genetically modified maize was better, as it was easier to farm, while the women tended to say that the landrace maize was better because it was more nutritional and better tasting than the genetically modified maize.\n\nIn Brazil, large plantations and fincas are often worked by several families. Fieldwork is a large portion of the workers' time, in the case both of men and of women.\n\nIn areas of more scattered agriculture, running water is often unavailable. It is usually women who must carry large water containers home from the stream or well in these cases, even though it is men who usually lift most other heavy loads on the Brazilian ranch, such as harvest sacks.\n\nAmong inland indigenous peoples, varying forms of the pan-Amazonian (or pan-Amazon-basin) gender role construct are seen. In these societies, especially those in which polygynous marriage has been practiced, the family unit is considered on two levels, the matrifocal and the patrifocal. Crop plots are owned by the brothers of any patrifocal family collectively; thus, if a man plants a field of any crop, all of his brothers and paternal half-brothers are considered to automatically own an equal share of the harvest.\n\nAgriculture is varied but consists largely of ranching activity. There is very little emphasis on gender roles in Argentina and Chile, compared to the rest of South America. Names for most agricultural \"job descriptions\" and individual roles are gender-neutral, with only the final letter changing according to the sex of the individual. The @ symbol is sometimes used, in lieu of either \"o\" or \"a\", to describe the general occupation without specifying gender, as in \"Buscamos puester@s para...\" (as might be written in a help-wanted poster).\n\nIn a lot of African countries nowadays, women rights are secondary in the sense that males dominant in assets, ownership, and education. Women are usually in charge of light farming or crop processing, while males have more opportunities to work with livestock and stay out of their household duty. But it also vary with ethnic groups, age and production cycles. Women are also responsible for children care, their financial ability and educational level may post strong influences on children’s well-being. Research showed that equine assisted rural women to finish their chores earlier, which provides females more time for children care. Moreover, by empowering women with assets and knowledge, the children’s nutritional status may be improved.\n\n\n"}

In addition, in contemporary Belgium there are also some other areas where German is or has been spoken (the difference line between German, Dutch, Luxembourgish and Limburgish is very slight since they are all part of the same dialect continuum) that belonged to Belgium even before 1920, but they are not currently officially considered part of the German-speaking Community of Belgium: Bleiberg-Welkenraedt-Baelen in northeastern province of Liège and Arelerland (city of Arlon and some of its nearby villages in southeastern province of Belgian Luxembourg). However, in these localities, the German language is declining due to the expansion of French.\n\nThe area known today as the East Cantons consists of the German-speaking Community and the municipalities of Malmedy and Waimes (), which belong to the French Community of Belgium. The East Cantons were part of the Rhine Province of Prussia in Germany until 1920 (as the counties (') of Eupen and Malmedy), but were annexed by Belgium following Germany's defeat in World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles. Thus they also became known as the ', \"redeemed cantons\". The peace treaty of Versailles demanded the \"questioning\" of the local population. People who were unwilling to become Belgians and wanted the region to remain a part of Germany were required to register themselves along with their full name and address with the Belgian military administration, headed by Herman Baltia, and many feared reprisals or even expulsion for doing so.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, there were secret negotiations between Germany and the kingdom of Belgium that seemed to be inclined to sell the region back to Germany as a way to improve Belgium's finances. A price of 200 million gold marks has been mentioned. At this point, the French government, fearing for the complete postwar order, intervened at Brussels and the Belgian-German talks were called off.\n\nThe new cantons had been part of Belgium for just 20 years when, in 1940, they were retaken by Germany in World War II. The majority of people of the east cantons welcomed this as they considered themselves German. Following the defeat of Germany in 1945, the cantons were once again annexed by Belgium, and as a result of alleged collaboration with Nazi Germany an attempt was made to de-Germanize the local population by the Belgian and Walloon authorities.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Belgium was divided into four linguistic areas, the Dutch-speaking Flemish area, the French-speaking area, the bilingual capital of Brussels, and the German-speaking area of the east cantons. In 1973, three communities and three regions were established and granted internal autonomy. The legislative Parliament of the German-speaking Community, \"\", was set up. Today the German-speaking Community has a fair degree of autonomy, especially in language and cultural matters, but it still remains part of the region of predominantly French-speaking Wallonia. There has been much argument in the past few years that the German-speaking Community should also become its own region, which is an ongoing process with the permanent transfer with the previous accord of some competences concerning social policy, conservation of sites and monuments, environment protection policy, transport, the financing of municipalities, among other things from the Walloon Region. One of the proponents of full regional autonomy for the German-speaking Community is Karl-Heinz Lambertz, the minister-president from 1999 to 2014. Especially regional autonomy for spatial planning, city building and housing should be considered, according to the government of the German-speaking Community.\n\nThe German-speaking Community has its own government, which is appointed for five years by its own parliament. The Government is headed by a Minister-President, who acts as the \"prime minister\" of the Community, and is assisted by the Ministry of the German-speaking Community. The 2014–2019 government is formed by four Ministers:\n\nThe German-speaking Community consists of the following nine municipalities:\n\n( = comparable to previous year).\n\nThe population figures are those on 1 January 2017 (compare to a total of 73,675 on 1 January 2007).\n\nIn 1989, there was a call for proposals for a flag and arms of the Community. In the end the coat of arms of the Community was designed by merging the arms of the Duchy of Limburg and the Duchy of Luxembourg, to which the two parts of the community had historically belonged.\n\nA decree adopted on 1 October 1990 and published on 15 November 1990 prescribed the arms, the flag, the colours as well as the Day of the German-speaking Community of Belgium, which was to be celebrated annually on 15 November.\n\nThe coat of arms, in heraldic blazon, is: \"Arms: Argent, a lion rampant gules between nine cinquefoils azure. Crest: A royal crown.\" The flag shows a red lion together with nine blue cinquefoils on a white field. The colours of the German-speaking Community are white and red in a horizontal position.\n\n\n"}

One of them, 20-year-old Chen Xiaofeng (陈晓凤), a student from Shijiazhuang at the Electronic Information Engineering College died later in the hospital. The other victim, Zhang Jingjing (张晶晶), aged 19, remained in a stable condition, albeit suffering from a fractured left leg. \n\nThe drunk driver, 22-year-old Li Qiming (李启铭), tried to escape the scene and continued driving to the female dormitory to drop off his girlfriend. When arrested by security guards, convinced his father's position would give him immunity, he shouted out, \"Go ahead, sue me if you dare. My dad is Li Gang!\"\n\nAfter outrage erupted on Chinese internet forums, a human flesh search engine revealed that Li Gang was the deputy director of the local public security bureau. Four days after the incident, an online poetry contest invited entrants to incorporate the sentence \"My father is Li Gang\" (我爸是李刚, pinyin: \"Wǒ bà shì Lǐ Gāng\") into classical Chinese poems. The contest was created by a female blogger in northern China nicknamed Piggy Feet Beta on MOP, a popular Chinese bulletin board system. It received more than 6,000 submissions. The phrase has since become a popular catchphrase and internet meme within China, frequently seen on various forums and message boards, and in similar competitions using ad slogans and song lyrics, and used ironically in conversation by speakers trying to avoid responsibility.\n\nCommunist Party officials tried at first to suppress reports of the incident, but their efforts backfired. During an interview with China Central Television on 21 October, Li Gang wept in an apology; then on 22 October, a video showing Li Qiming's apology was released. The apology was rejected by the victims' families, the elder brother of Chen Xiaofeng believing the apology to be a political stunt. The \"People's Daily\", in an editorial published on October 26, urged authorities to take the affair into their own hands and shed light on the matter.\n\nOn October 29, the \"South China Morning Post\" and other sources revealed that a directive from the Central Propaganda Department, issued on October 28, required that there be \"no more hype regarding the disturbance over traffic at Hebei University,\" and ordered Chinese newspapers to recall their reporters from Baoding. \n\nOn November 1, Zhang Kai, the attorney for the relatives of Chen Xiaofeng, was abruptly asked to terminate his representation in the case, after the law firm was cautioned by the Beijing Bureau of Justice, according to a blog by Wang Keqin, an influential Chinese muckraking reporter, \nblogger and professor at Peking University. That same day, Director Liu of Baoding Traffic Police Division and some clerks from Wangdu County proposed payments to the relatives of Chen Xiaofeng to settle the case.\n\nOn November 4, the Central Propaganda Department banned news of an interview by Phoenix Television with Ms. Chen’s brother, Chen Lin, in which he was critical of the government.\n\nThen on November 9, Internet discussion of the case suddenly stopped. Local students and activists such as Ai Weiwei, however, continued to speak out.\n\nIn January 2011, Li Qiming was arrested. He was sentenced to six years in jail and ordered to pay the equivalent of $69,900 in compensation to the family of Chen Xiaofeng. Li was also ordered to pay $13,800 to the injured woman.\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1877 and was dissolved in 1927. The organisation was secular, utilitarian, individualistic, and \"above all malthusian.\" The organisation maintained that it was concerned about the poverty of the British working class and held that over-population was the chief cause of poverty.\n\nThe league was initially founded during the \"Knowlton trial\" of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh in July 1877. They were prosecuted for publishing Charles Knowlton's \"Fruits of Philosophy\" which explained various methods of birth control. The League was formed as a permanent body to advocate for the elimination of penalties for promoting birth control as well as to promote public education in matters of contraception. The trial demonstrated that the public was interested in the topic of contraception and sales of the book surged during the trial.\n\nThe first president was Charles Robert Drysdale, who was succeeded by his free union partner Alice Vickery. The league initially restricted itself primarily to an \"educative role\" which emphasised the importance of Malthus' economic arguments rather than practical information about birth control. The league had an increasingly socially and economically conservative tone as the 19th century wore on. Thus some earlier agreement between Malthusians and social reformers was replaced by mutual distrust. The league believed that the sole cause of poverty was an excess of births, and therefore opposed socialism, considered strikes and reforms of labour laws to be \"useless.\" League members were primarily middle class and did not make many serious efforts to communicate with the working class aside from some debates with socialists during the 1880s. Although the league doctrine as a whole was hostile to socialism, some members were indeed socialists who were sympathetic to arguments in favour of birth control. The league also maintained some overlap with the women's rights movement, which was concerned with birth control. The League began plans for a birth control clinic in 1917 but these stalled\nuntil they received funds from the philanthropist Sir John Sumner and finally the clinic opened on 9 November 1921 at 153a East Street, Walworth with Norman Haire as their honorary medical officer, three afternoons a week. Marie Stopes and her husband had opened their clinic nine months earlier. Stopes’ clinic was the first in the British Empire (but not the first in the world) and the League always emphasised that theirs was the first English clinic where birth control instruction was given under medical supervision.\n\nSimilar leagues were founded in several other European countries including Germany, France, and the Netherlands in the following years. In 1892, the Dutch league became the first to set up a medical clinic to provide information directly to the poor.\n\nThe period of the league's activity coincided with a substantial drop in the birth rate in Britain, and many European countries. Some have credited its activities, but others have disputed this conclusion, citing the general fall in birth rates even in countries without active league activity.\n\nThe Malthusian League forms part of the society within Aldous Huxley's novel Brave New World.\n\n"}

When using the Zarma language, they are known as the Arawa people.\n\nThe establishment of the Maouri people is uncertain, though many sources indicate descent from the Bornu Empire. The Maouri established two capitals in Matankari and Lougou, with religious authority based in Bagaji.\n\nThe Maouri are animistic, with beliefs based on the Doguwa spirits. Islam (especially in Dogondoutchi) and Christianity have since gained some adherents among the Maouri, but they still largely hold to traditional beliefs, including fetishes. They resisted an attempted forced conversion to Islam in the early 19th century during the Fulani jihads and subsequent establishment of the Sokoto Caliphate.\n\nThe Maouri were also subject to colonization by European powers. The Maouri lands were traded between the English and French colonies in West Africa under various treaties between 1890 and 1906. The French were particularly brutal in their administration of their colonies: in 1898 the priestess of Lougou, Sarraounia, resisted an attack by the French Voulet-Chanoine Mission at the Battle of Lougou. The town ultimately fell, though Sarraounia's forces managed a retreat and were able to inflict ten casualties on the much more numerous and better-armed French soldiers. The French later massacred the neighboring Konni town of Birni-N'Konni in revenge.\n\nToday the Maouri are traders and farmers, and have a reputation as industrious people.\n"}

Referred to as the \"Songbird Supreme\" by the \"Guinness World Records\", she is noted for her five-octave vocal range, power, melismatic style, and signature use of the whistle register. She rose to superstardom in 1990 after signing to Columbia Records and releasing her eponymous debut album, which topped the US \"Billboard\" 200 for 11 consecutive weeks. Carey became the first and only artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, from \"Vision of Love\" to \"Emotions\".\n\nFollowing her marriage to Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, Carey became the label's highest-selling act with the follow-up albums \"Music Box\" (1993), \"Merry Christmas\" (1994), and \"Daydream\" (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including \"Hero\", \"Without You\", \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", and \"One Sweet Day\"; the latter became the longest-running U.S. number-one single in history, with a total of 16 weeks. After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of hip hop into her music with the release of \"Butterfly\" (1997). \"Billboard\" named her the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States, while the World Music Awards honored her as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s.\n\nAfter 11 consecutive years charting a number-one single, Carey parted with Columbia in 2000 and signed a record-breaking $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records. However, following her highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the failure of her film \"Glitter\" (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack, her contract was bought out for $50 million by Virgin and she signed with Island Records the next year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" (2005). It became the world's second best-selling album of 2005 and produced \"We Belong Together\", which made her the only artist to top the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Decade-End chart twice. With the release of \"Touch My Body\" (2008), Carey gained her 18th number-one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist.\n\nThroughout her career, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. According to the RIAA, she is the third-best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums. In 2012, she was ranked second on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music. Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards, 19 World Music Awards, 10 American Music Awards, and 14 Billboard Music Awards, and has been consistently credited with inspiring generations of singers.\n\nMariah Carey was born in Huntington, New York. Her father, Alfred Roy Carey, was of African American and Afro-Venezuelan descent, while her mother, Patricia (née Hickey), is of Irish descent. The last name Carey was adopted by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Núñez, after he came to New York. Patricia was an occasional opera singer and vocal coach before she met Alfred in 1960. As he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer, the couple wed later that year, and moved into a small suburb in New York. After their elopement, Patricia's family disowned her for marrying a black man. Carey later explained that growing up, she felt neglected by her maternal family, which greatly affected her. During the years between the births of Carey's older sister Alison and herself, the Carey family struggled within the community due to their ethnicity. Carey's name was derived from the song \"They Call the Wind Maria\", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical \"Paint Your Wagon.\" When Carey was three, her parents divorced.\nAfter their separation, Alison moved in with her father, while the other two children, Mariah and brother Morgan, remained with their mother. Carey would grow apart from her father, and would later stop seeing him altogether. By the age of four, Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night, and just sing and try to find peace within the music. During elementary school, she excelled in subjects that she enjoyed, such as music, art, and literature, but did not find interest in others. After several years of financial struggles, Patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in New York. Carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them, thus starting as a singer-songwriter while attending Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, where she graduated in 1987. Carey excelled in her music, and demonstrated usage of the whistle register, though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother. Though introducing her daughter to classical opera, Patricia never pressured her to pursue a career in it, as she never seemed interested. Carey recalled that she kept her singer-songwriter works a secret and noted that Patricia had \"never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel.' I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me.\"\n\nWhile in high school, Carey began writing songs with Gavin Christopher. They needed an assistant who could play the keyboard: \"We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled upon Ben [Margulies]. Ben came to the studio, and he really couldn't play the keyboards very well – he was really more of a drummer – but after that day, we kept in touch, and we sort of clicked as writers.\" Carey and Christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his father's store during Carey's senior year. After composing their first song together, \"Here We Go 'Round Again\", which Carey described as having a Motown vibe, they continued writing material for a full-length demo. She began living in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which she shared with four other female students. Carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants, usually getting fired after two weeks. While requiring work to pay for her rent, Carey still had musical ambitions, as she continued working late into the night with Margulies in hopes of completing a demo. After completing her four song demo tape, Carey attempted to pass it to music labels, but failed each time. Shortly thereafter, she was introduced to rising pop singer Brenda K. Starr.\n\nAs Starr's friendship with Carey grew, so did her interest in helping Carey succeed in the industry. In December 1988, Carey accompanied Starr to a record executives' gala, where she handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola, who listened to it on his way back home. After the first two songs, he was interested in her; later, after searching for Carey for two weeks, he immediately signed her and began mapping out her commercial debut. While she maintained that she wanted to continue working with Margulies, Mottola enlisted top producers of the time, including Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence. Mottola and the staff at Columbia had planned to market Carey as their main female pop artist, competing with Whitney Houston and Madonna (signed to Arista and Sire Records respectively). After the completion of her debut album, \"Mariah Carey\", Columbia spent more than $1 million promoting it. Despite a weak start, the album eventually reached the top of the \"Billboard\" 200, after Carey's exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards. \"Mariah Carey\" stayed atop the charts for eleven consecutive weeks, and she won the Best New Artist, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance awards for her single \"Vision of Love.\" In addition to \"Vision of Love\", the album yielded the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one singles \"Love Takes Time\", \"Someday\", and \"I Don't Wanna Cry\". Carey became the first musical act since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles reach number one. \"Mariah Carey\" finished as the best-selling album in the United States in 1991, while totaling sales of over 15 million copies.\n\nCarey began recording her second studio album, \"Emotions\", in 1991. She described it as an homage to Motown soul music, as she felt the need to pay tribute to the type of music that had influenced her as a child. For the project, Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, who only had a small role on her debut, as well as Robert Clivillés and David Cole, from the dance group C+C Music Factory. Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a personal contract Carey had signed with him before signing the record deal with Columbia, agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well. However, when the time came to write music for \"Emotions,\" Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album. Margulies later filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways. \"Emotions\" was released on September 17, 1991, and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor. While praised for Carey's improved songwriting, production, and new sound, the album was criticized for its material, thought weaker than that of her debut. Though the album managed sales of over eight million copies globally, \"Emotions\" failed to reach the commercial and critical heights of its predecessor.\n\nAs after the release of her debut, critics again questioned whether Carey would embark on a world tour to promote her material. Although Carey explained that stage fright and the style of her songs made a tour very daunting, speculation grew that Carey was a \"studio worm,\" and that she was incapable of producing the perfect pitch and 5-octave vocal range for which she was known. In hopes of putting to rest any claims of her being a manufactured artist, Carey and Walter Afanasieff decided to book an appearance on MTV Unplugged, a television program aired by MTV. The show presented name artists \"unplugged\" or stripped of studio equipment. While Carey favored her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content would be included. Days before the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected. They chose \"I'll Be There\", a song made popular by The Jackson 5 in 1970. On March 16, 1992, Carey recorded a seven-piece set-list at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The revue was met with critical acclaim, leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would. The success tempted Sony officials to market it. Sony decided to release it as an EP, priced low because it was short. The EP proved to be a success, contrary to critics and speculations that Carey was just a studio artist, and was given a triple-Platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and managed Gold and Platinum certifications in several European markets.\n\nDuring early 1993, Carey began working on her third studio album, \"Music Box\". After \"Emotions\" failed to achieve the commercial heights of her debut album, Carey and Columbia came to the agreement that the next album would contain a more pop influenced sound, in order to appeal to a wider audience. During Carey's writing sessions, she began working mostly with Afanasieff, with whom she co-wrote and produced most of \"Music Box\". On August 31, \"Music Box\" was released around the world, debuting at number-one on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album was met with mixed reception from music critics; while many praised the album's pop influence and strong content, others felt that Carey made less usage of her acclaimed vocal range. Ron Wynn from AllMusic described Carey's different form of singing on the album: \"It was wise for Carey to display other elements of her approach, but sometimes excessive spirit is preferable to an absence of passion.\" The album's second single, \"Hero\", would eventually come to be one of Carey's most popular and inspirational songs of her career. The song became Carey's eighth chart topper in the United States, and began expanding Carey's popularity throughout Europe. With the release of the album's third single, Carey achieved several career milestones. Her cover of Badfinger's \"Without You\" became her first number one single in Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Music Box\" spent prolonged periods at number one on the album charts of several countries, and eventually became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with worldwide sales of over 28 million copies. After declining to tour for her past two albums, Carey agreed to embark on a short stateside string of concerts, titled the Music Box Tour. Spanning only six dates across North America, the short but successful tour was a large step for Carey, who dreaded the hassle of touring. Following \"Music Box\", Carey took a relatively large period of time away from the public eye, and began working on an unknown project throughout 1994. In October 1994, \"Billboard\" announced that Carey would release a holiday album later that year. That 1994, Carey recorded a duet with Luther Vandross; a cover of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross's \"Endless Love\". Carey's album \"Merry Christmas\" was released on November 1, 1994, on the same day that the album's first single, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", was released. The album eventually became the best-selling Christmas album of all time, with global sales reaching over 15 million copies. Upon its release, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" was critically praised, and is considered \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon.\" \"Rolling Stone\" described it as a \"holiday standard and ranked it fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list. Commercially, it became the best-selling holiday ringtone of all time, and the best-selling single by a non-Asian artist in Japan, selling over 2.1 million units (both ringtone and digital download). By the end of the holiday season of 1994, Carey and Afanasieff had already begun writing material for her next studio album, which would be released late the following year.\nReleased on October 3, 1995, \"Daydream\" combined the pop sensibilities of \"Music Box\" with downbeat R&B and hip hop influences. The album's second single, \"One Sweet Day\" was inspired by the death of David Cole. The song remained atop the Hot 100 for a record-holding 16 weeks, and became the longest-running number-one song in history. \"Daydream\" became her biggest-selling album in the United States, and became her second album to be certified Diamond by the RIAA, following \"Music Box\". The album again was the best-seller by an international artist in Japan, shipping over 2.2 million copies, and eventually reaching global sales of over 20 million copies. Critically, the album was heralded as Carey's best to date; \"The New York Times\" named it one of 1995's best albums, and wrote, \"best cuts bring R&B candy-making to a new peak of textural refinement [...] Carey's songwriting has taken a leap forward and become more relaxed, sexier and less reliant on thudding clichés.\" Carey once again opted to embark on a short world tour titled Daydream World Tour. It had seven dates, three in Japan and four throughout Europe. When tickets went on sale, Carey set records when all 150,000 tickets for her three shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under three hours, breaking the previous record held by The Rolling Stones. Due to the album's success, Carey won two awards at the American Music Awards for her solo efforts: Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist. \"Daydream\" and its singles were respectively nominated in six categories at the 38th Grammy Awards. Carey, along with Boyz II Men, opened the event with a performance of \"One Sweet Day\". However, Carey did not receive any award, prompting her to comment \"What can you do? I will never be disappointed again. After I sat through the whole show and didn't win once, I can handle anything.\" In 1995, due to \"Daydream\"s enormous Japanese sales, \"Billboard\" declared Carey the \"Overseas Artist of the Year\" in Japan.\n\nWith her following albums, Carey began to take more initiative and control with her music, and started infusing more genres into her work. For \"Butterfly\", she sought to work with other producers and writers other than Afanasieff, such as Sean Combs, Kamaal Fareed, Missy Elliott and Jean Claude Oliver and Samuel Barnes from Trackmasters. During the album's recording, Carey and Mottola separated, with Carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom, and a new lease on life. Aside from the album's different approach, critics took notice of Carey's altered style of singing, which she described as breathy vocals. Her new-found style of singing was met with mixed reception; some critics felt this was a sign of maturity, that she did not feel the need to always show off her upper range, while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice. The album's lead single, \"Honey\", and its accompanying music video, introduced a more overtly sexual image than Carey had ever demonstrated, and furthered reports of her freedom from Mottola. Carey believed that her image was not \"that much of a departure from what I've done in the past [...] It's not like I went psycho and thought I would be a rapper. Personally, this album is about doing whatever the hell I wanted to do.\" Reviews for \"Butterfly\" were generally positive: \"Rolling Stone\" wrote, \"It's not as if Carey has totally dispensed with her old saccharine, Houston-style balladry [...] but the predominant mood of 'Butterfly' is one of coolly erotic reverie.\" AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Carey's vocals as \"sultrier and more controlled than ever,\" and heralded \"Butterfly\" as one of her \"best records and illustrates that Carey continues to improve and refine her music, which makes her a rarity among her '90s peers.'\" The album was a commercial success, although not to the degree of her previous albums \"Mariah Carey\", \"Music Box\" and \"Daydream\".\nCarey began developing other projects during the late 1990s. On April 14, 1998, Carey partook in the VH1 Divas benefit concert, where she sang alongside Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan, and Carole King. Carey had begun developing a film project \"All That Glitters\", later re-titled to simply \"Glitter\", and wrote songs for other projects, such as \"Men in Black\" (1997) and \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (2000). After \"Glitter\" fell into developmental hell, Carey postponed the project, and began writing material for a new album. Sony Music executives wanted her to prepare a greatest hits collection in time for the holiday season. They wanted to release an album that featured her number one singles in the United States, and her international chart toppers on the European versions, without any new material, while Carey felt that a compilation album should reflect on her most personal songs, not just her most commercial. The album, titled \"#1's\" (1998), featured a duet with Whitney Houston, \"When You Believe\", which was included on the soundtrack for \"The Prince of Egypt\" (1998). \"#1's\" became a phenomenon in Japan, selling over one million copies in its opening week, making Carey as the only international artist to accomplish this feat. It sold over 3.25 million copies in Japan after only the first three months, and holds the record as the best-selling album by a non-Asian artist.\n\nDuring the spring of 1999, Carey began working on the final album per her record contract with Sony. But due to the pressure and the awkward relationship Carey had developed with Sony, she completed the album in a period of three months in the summer of 1999, quicker than any of her other albums. Titled \"Rainbow\" (1999), the album found Carey once again working with a new array of music producers and songwriters, such as Jay-Z and DJ Clue?. Carey also wrote two ballads with David Foster and Diane Warren, whom she used to replace Afanasieff. \"Rainbow\" was released on November 2, 1999, to the highest first week sales of her career at the time, however debuting at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. In the meantime Carey's troubled relationship with Columbia grew, as they halted promotion after the album's first two singles. They felt \"Rainbow\" didn't have any strong single to be released, whereas Carey wanted to release a ballad. This led to a very public feud, as Carey began posting messages on her website, telling fans inside information on the dispute, as well as instructing them to request \"Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)\" on radio stations. The song was ultimately released but Carey found out that the song had only been given a very limited and low-promotion release, which made it commercially non-viable. Critical reception of \"Rainbow\" was generally enthusiastic, with the \"Sunday Herald\" saying that the album \"sees her impressively tottering between soul ballads and collaborations with R&B heavyweights like Snoop Doggy Dogg and Usher [...] It's a polished collection of pop-soul.\" Though a commercial success, \"Rainbow\" became Carey's lowest selling album to that point in her career.\n\nAfter she received \"Billboard\"s Artist of the Decade Award and the World Music Award for Best-Selling Female Artist of the Millennium, Carey parted from Columbia and signed an estimated $100 million, five-album recording contract with Virgin Records America (EMI Records) in April 2001. Carey was given full conceptual and creative control over the project. She opted to record an album partly mixed with 1980s influenced disco and other similar genres, in order to go hand-in-hand with the film's setting. She often stated that Columbia had regarded her as a commodity, with her separation from Mottola exacerbating her relations with label executives. Just a few months later, in July 2001, it was widely reported that Carey had suffered a physical and emotional breakdown. She had left messages on her website that complained of being overworked, and her three-year relationship with the singer Luis Miguel ended. In an interview the following year, she said, \"I was with people who didn't really know me and I had no personal assistant. I'd do interviews all day long and get two hours of sleep a night, if that.\" Due to the pressure from the media, her heavy work schedule and the split from Miguel, Carey began posting a series of disturbing messages on her official website, and displayed erratic behavior on several live promotional outings. On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program \"Total Request Live\" (TRL). As the show's host Carson Daly began taping following a commercial break, Carey came out pushing an ice cream cart while wearing a large men's shirt, and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble. While she later revealed that Daly was aware of her presence in the building prior to her appearance, Carey's appearance on TRL garnered strong media attention. Only days later, Carey began posting irregular voice notes and messages on her official website: \"I'm trying to understand things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd like to do is just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [to] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.\" Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been \"obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly\" when she posted the letters.\nOn July 26, she was suddenly hospitalized, citing \"extreme exhaustion\" and a \"physical and emotional breakdown.\" Carey was admitted to an undisclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both \"Glitter\", as well as its soundtrack of the same name. When discussing the project's weak commercial reaction, Carey blamed both her frame of mind during the time of its release, its postponement, as well as the soundtrack having been released on September 11. Critics panned \"Glitter\", as well as its accompanying soundtrack; both were unsuccessful commercially. The accompanying soundtrack album, \"Glitter\", became Carey's lowest-selling album to that point. The \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" dismissed it as \"an absolute mess that'll go down as an annoying blemish on a career that, while not always critically heralded, was at least nearly consistently successful.\" Following the negative cloud that was enveloping Carey's personal life at the time, as well as the project's poor reception, her $100 million five-album record deal with Virgin Records America (EMI Records) was bought out for $50 million. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year. Carey later said that her time at Virgin was \"a complete and total stress-fest [...] I made a total snap decision which was based on money and I never make decisions based on money. I learned a big lesson from that.\" Later that year, she signed a contract with Island Records, valued at more than $24 million, and launched the record label MonarC. To add further to Carey's emotional burdens, her father, with whom she had little contact since childhood, died of cancer that year.\n\nIn 2002, Carey was cast in the independent film, \"WiseGirls\", alongside Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters, who co-starred as waitresses at a mobster-operated restaurant. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and received generally negative critical response, though Carey's portrayal of the character was praised; Roger Friedman of Fox News referred to her as \"a Thelma Ritter for the new millennium,\" and wrote, \"Her line delivery is sharp and she manages to get the right laughs.\" Later that year, Carey performed the American national anthem to rave reviews at the Super Bowl XXXVI at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Towards the end of 2002, Carey released her next studio album \"Charmbracelet\", which she said marked \"a new lease on life\" for her. Though released in the wake of \"Glitter\" and Carey's return to the music scene, sales of \"Charmbracelet\" were moderate and the quality of Carey's vocals came under criticism. Joan Anderson from \"The Boston Globe\" declared the album \"the worst of her career, and revealed a voice [that is] no longer capable of either gravity-defying gymnastics or soft coos,\" while AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine expressed similar sentiments and wrote, \"What is a greater problem is that Mariah's voice is shot, sounding in tatters throughout the record. She can no longer coo or softly croon nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs.\"\n\nIn April 2003, Carey announced she would be touring later in the year. The Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey, spanned North America and East Asia over three months, generally playing in smaller venues rather than arenas. Throughout the United States, the shows were done in theaters, and something more Broadway-influenced, \"It's much more intimate so you'll feel like you had an experience. You experience a night with me.\" However, while smaller productions were booked throughout the tour's stateside leg, Carey performed at stadiums in Asia and Europe, performing for a crowd of over 35,000 in Manila, 50,000 in Malaysia, and to over 70,000 people in China. In the United Kingdom, it became Carey's first tour to feature shows outside London, booking arena stops in Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester. Charmbracelet World Tour: An Intimate Evening with Mariah Carey garnered generally positive reviews from music critics and concert goers, with many complimenting the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the production as a whole.\n\nThroughout 2004, Carey focused on composing material for her tenth studio album, \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" (2005). The album found Carey working predominantly with Jermaine Dupri, as well as Bryan-Michael Cox, Manuel Seal, The Neptunes and Kanye West. The album debuted atop the charts in several countries, and was warmly accepted by critics. Caroline Sullivan of \"The Guardian\" defined it as \"cool, focused and urban [... some of] the first Mariah Carey tunes in years which I wouldn't have to be paid to listen to again,\" while \"USA Today\"s Elysa Gardner wrote, \"The ballads and midtempo numbers that truly reflect the renewed confidence of a songbird who has taken her shots and kept on flying.\" The album's second single, \"We Belong Together\", became a \"career re-defining\" song for Carey, at a point when many critics had considered her career over. Music critics heralded the song as her \"return to form,\" as well as the \"return of The Voice,\" while many felt it would revive \"faith\" in Carey's potential as a balladeer. \"We Belong Together\" broke several records in the United States and became Carey's sixteenth chart topper on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks, the song became the second longest running number one song in US chart history, behind Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, \"One Sweet Day\". \"Billboard\" listed it as the \"song of the decade\" and the ninth most popular song of all time. Besides its chart success, the song broke several airplay records, and according to Nielsen BDS, gathered both the largest one-day and one-week audiences in history.\n\nDuring the week of September 25, 2005, Carey set another record, becoming the first female to occupy the first two spots atop the Hot 100, as \"We Belong Together\" remained at number one, and her next single, \"Shake It Off\" moved into the number two spot (Ashanti had topped the chart in 2002 while being a \"featured\" singer on the number two single). On the Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart of 2005, the song was declared the number one song, a career first for Carey. \"Billboard\" listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on The \"Billboard\" Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and was declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by \"Billboard\". The album earned ten Grammy Award nominations in 2006–07: eight in 2006 for the original release (the most received by Carey in a single year), and two in 2007 for the \"Ultra Platinum Edition\" (from which \"Don't Forget About Us\" became her seventeenth number-one hit). In 2006 Carey won Best Contemporary R&B Album for \"The Emancipation of Mimi\", as well as Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song for \"We Belong Together\". \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" was the best-selling album in the United States in 2005, with nearly five million units sold. It was the first album by a solo female artist to become the year's best-selling album since Alanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill\" in 1996. At the end of 2005, the IFPI reported that \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" had sold more than 7.7 million copies globally, and was the second-best-selling album of the year after Coldplay's \"X&Y\". It was the best-selling album worldwide by a solo and female artist. To date, \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. At the 48th Grammy Awards, Carey performed a medley of \"We Belong Together\" and \"Fly Like a Bird\".\n\nIn support of the album, Carey embarked on her first headlining tour in three years, named The Adventures of Mimi: The Voice, The Hits, The Tour after a \"Carey-centric fan's\" music diary. The tour spanned forty stops, with thirty-two in the United States and Canada, two in Africa, and six in Japan. It received warm reaction from music critics and concert goers, many of which celebrated the quality of Carey's live vocals, as well as the show as a whole. Carey played to about 60,000 fans in the two shows in Tunis. \"The Adventures of Mimi\" DVD was released in November 2007 internationally and December 2007 in the U.S.\n\nBy spring 2007, Carey had begun to work on her eleventh studio album, \"E=MC²\", in a private villa in Anguilla. Although \"E=MC²\" was well received by most critics, some of them criticized it for being very similar to the formula used on \"The Emancipation of Mimi\". Two weeks before the album's release, \"Touch My Body\", the record's lead single, reached the top position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming Carey's eighteenth number one and making her the solo artist with the most number one singles in United States history, pushing her past Elvis Presley into second place according to the magazine's revised methodology. Carey is second only to The Beatles, who have twenty number-one singles. Additionally, it gave Carey her 79th week atop the Hot 100, tying her with Presley as the artist with the most weeks at number one in the \"Billboard\" chart history.\"\n\"E=MC²\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 463,000 copies sold, the biggest opening week sales of her career. In 2008, Carey also played an aspiring singer named Krystal in \"Tennessee\" and had a cameo appearance in Adam Sandler's film \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\", playing herself. Since the album's release, Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of \"E=MC²\". However the tour was suddenly cancelled in early December 2008. Carey later stated that she had been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage, hence she cancelled the tour. On January 20, 2009, Carey performed \"Hero\" at the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball after Barack Obama was sworn as the first African-American president of the United States. On July 7, 2009, Carey – alongside Trey Lorenz – performed her version of The Jackson 5 song \"I'll Be There\" at the memorial service for Michael Jackson.\n\nIn 2009, she appeared as a social worker in \"Precious\", the movie adaptation of the 1996 novel \"Push\" by Sapphire. The film garnered mostly positive reviews from critics, also for Carey's performance. \"Variety\" described her acting as \"pitch-perfect.\" In January 2010, Carey won the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award for her role in \"Precious\" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. On September 25, 2009, Carey's twelfth studio album, \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\", was released. Reception for the album was mostly mixed; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"her most interesting album in a decade,\" while Jon Caramanica from \"The New York Times\" criticized Carey's vocal performances, decrying her overuse of her softer vocal registers at the expense of her more powerful lower and upper registers. Commercially, the album debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200, and became the lowest-selling studio album of her career. The album's lead single, \"Obsessed\", debuted at number eleven and peaked at number seven on the chart, and became Carey's 27th US top-ten hit, tying her with Elton John and Janet Jackson as the fifth most top-ten hits. The album's follow-up single, a cover of Foreigner's \"I Want to Know What Love Is\", managed to break airplay records in Brazil. The song spent 27 weeks atop the Brasil Hot 100 Airplay, making it the longest running song in the chart's history.\n\nOn December 31, 2009, Carey embarked her seventh concert tour, Angels Advocate Tour, which visited the United States and Canada and ended on September 26, 2010. A planned remix album of \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\"; titled \"Angels Advocate\" was slated for a March 30, 2010 release, but was eventually cancelled.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of \"Angels Advocate\", it was announced that Carey would return to the studio to start work on her thirteenth studio album. It was later revealed that it would be her second Christmas album, and follow-up to \"Merry Christmas\". Longtime collaborators for the project included Jermaine Dupri, Johntá Austin, Bryan-Michael Cox, and Randy Jackson, as well as new collaborators such as Marc Shaiman. The release date for the album, titled \"Merry Christmas II You\", was November 2, 2010; the track list included six new songs as well as a remix of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\". \"Merry Christmas II You\" debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, becoming Carey's 16th top ten album in the United States. The album debuted at number one on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top this chart.\nIn May 2010, Carey dropped out of her planned appearance in \"For Colored Girls\", the film adaptation of the play \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf\", citing medical reasons. In February 2011, Carey announced that she had officially began writing new material for her upcoming fourteenth studio album. Carey recorded a duet with Tony Bennett for his \"Duets II\" album, titled \"When Do The Bells Ring For Me?\" In October 2011, Carey announced that she re-recorded \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" with Justin Bieber as a duet for his Christmas album, \"Under the Mistletoe\". In November 2011, Carey was included in the remix to the mixtape single \"Warning\" by Uncle Murda; the remix also features 50 Cent and Young Jeezy. That same month, Carey released a duet with John Legend titled \"When Christmas Comes\", originally part of \"Merry Christmas II You\".\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Carey performed at New York City's Gotham Hall; her first time performing since pregnancy. She also performed a three song set at a special fundraiser for US President Barack Obama held in New York's Plaza Hotel. A new song titled \"Bring It On Home\", which Carey wrote specifically for the event to show her support behind Obama's re-election campaign, was also performed. In August 2012, she released a stand alone single, \"Triumphant (Get 'Em)\", featuring American rappers Rick Ross and Meek Mill and co-written and co-produced by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, and Bryan-Michael Cox. Carey joined the judging panel of \"American Idol\" season twelve as Jennifer Lopez's replacement, joining Randy Jackson, Nicki Minaj and Keith Urban. In November 2013, she explained about hating to work at \"American Idol\" adding, \"It was like going to work every day in hell with Satan,\" referring to her on-set squabbles with Minaj. Carey appeared in Lee Daniels' 2013 film \"The Butler\", about a White House butler who served eight American presidents over the course of three decades. Carey made guest voice-star as a redneck character on the adult animated series \"American Dad!\" on November 24, 2013.\n\nIn February 2013 Carey recorded and released a song called \"Almost Home\", for the soundtrack of the Walt Disney Studios film \"Oz the Great and Powerful\". The video was directed by photographer David LaChapelle. News started coming around about the singer's fourteenth studio album. Some of the people that Carey worked with on the album included: DJ Clue?, Randy Jackson, Q-Tip, R. Kelly, David Morales, Loris Holland, Stevie J, James Fauntleroy II, Ray Angry, Afanasieff, Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, James \"Big Jim\" Wright, Hit-Boy, The-Dream, Da Brat, and Rodney Jerkins. Carey told \"Billboard\": \"It's about making sure I have tons of good music, because at the end of the day that's the most important thing... There are a lot more raw ballads than people might expect...there are also uptempo and signature-type songs that represent [my] different facets as an artist.\"\n\nThe lead single, \"Beautiful\" featuring singer Miguel, was released on May 6, 2013, and peaked at number 15 on the Hot 100. Carey taped a performance of \"Beautiful\" along with a medley of her greatest hits on May 15, 2013; the taping aired on the \"American Idol\" finale the following day. On October 14, 2013, Carey announced that the album's former title track has been chosen as the second single; it premiered via Facebook on November 11, 2013. During a Q&A session following the song's release, Carey gave an update about the album, stating: \"Now I've been inspired to add two more songs, so we're almost there. I can't even express this properly but I feel like this is gonna be my favorite album.\" Following another song release, \"You're Mine (Eternal)\", it was announced that \"The Art of Letting Go\" would no longer be the title of the album. After the final name was announced, \"Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse\" was released on May 27, 2014.\n\nIn October 2014, Carey announced All I Want For Christmas Is You, A Night of Joy & Festivity, an annual residency show at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. The first leg included six shows, running from December 15–22, 2014. Carey announced the second leg in October 2015. The second leg ran for 8 shows, from December 8–18, 2015.\n\nOn January 15, 2015, Carey announced her Number Ones residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. On January 30, it was announced that Carey has left Universal Music Group's Def Jam Recordings to re-unite with L.A. Reid and Sony Music via Epic Records.\n\nTo coincide with the residency, Carey released \"#1 to Infinity\", a greatest hits compilation album which contains all of her eighteen \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one singles, along with a new recording, \"Infinity\", which was released as a single on April 27. In 2015 Carey had her directorial debut for the Hallmark Channel Christmas movie \"A Christmas Melody\", in which she also performed as one of the main characters. Filming for the project took place during October 2015. In December 2015, Carey announced The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour which spanned a total of 27-dates beginning in March 2016, marking the first time the singer had done a significant tour of mainland Europe in 13 years. Four stops included shows in South Africa. The tour grossed 30.3 million dollars.\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Carey announced that she was filming \"Mariah's World\", a docu-series for the E! network documenting her Sweet Sweet Fantasy European tour and her wedding planning process. Carey told \"The New York Times\", \"I thought it would be a good opportunity to kind of, like, show my personality and who I am, even though I feel like my real fans have an idea of who I am... A lot of people have misperceptions about this and that.\" The series premiered on December 4, 2016. Carey guest starred on the musical drama \"Empire\", as a superstar singer named Kitty and sung the song \"Infamous\" featuring Jussie Smollett. On December 5, 2016, Carey participated in the \"VH1 Divas\" : \"Holiday: Unsilent Night\" benefit concert, alongside Vanessa Williams, Chaka Khan, Patti Labelle and Teyana Taylor.\n\nOn December 31, 2016, Carey's performance on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" in Times Square received worldwide attention after technical difficulties caused Carey's in-ear monitors to malfunction, resulting in what \"The New York Times\" referred to as a \"performance train wreck.\" The singer cited her inability to hear the music without in-ear auditory feedback as the cause for the mishap. Carey's representatives and Dick Clark Productions placed blame on each other.\n\nOn February 3, 2017, Carey released the single \"I Don't\" featuring YG. In February 8, 2017, she voiced the Mayor of Gotham City, in the animated film \"The Lego Batman Movie\". In April 2017, it was announced that Carey is launching her own record label, Butterfly MC Records, a joint partnership with Epic Records. In July 2017, Carey made a cameo in the comedy film \"Girls Trip\", starring Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith and Regina Hall. The same month, Carey embarked on a tour with Lionel Richie, titled, All the Hits Tour. Carey was featured in the official remix for French Montana's single \"Unforgettable\", alongside Swae Lee. In October 2017, Carey released a new soundtrack single, \"The Star\", for the movie of the same name. Carey also developed an animated Christmas film, titled \"Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You\", for which soundtrack she recorded an original song called \"Lil' Snowman.\" The film was released direct-to-video on November 14, 2017. In the same month, the singer resumed her All I Want for Christmas Is You, a Night of Joy and Festivity concert series, which for the first time visited other countries including England and France. On December 31, 2017, the singer returned to perform on \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" after the technical difficulties that hindered her previous performance, in what \"The New York Times\" described as a \"made-for-television act of pop culture redemption\".\n\nIn 2018, Carey signed a worldwide deal with Live Nation Entertainment. The first commitment out of the deal was her new Las Vegas residency The Butterfly Returns, which was launched in July 2018 to critical acclaim. Throughout the last three months of 2018 the singer is set to tour Asia with her Number 1's Tour, and will return to Europe with her show. On September 21, 2018, Carey headlined the iHeartRadio Music Festival. In September 2018, Carey announced plans to release her fifteenth studio album later in the year. The project was announced alongside the release of a new song titled \"GTFO\", which anticipates the album's first single, called \"With You\", which was released on October 4, 2018. The album, titled \"Caution\", was released on November 16, 2018.\n\nCarey is a philanthropist who has been involved with several charitable organizations. She became associated with the Fresh Air Fund in the early 1990s, and is the co-founder of a camp located in Fishkill, New York, that enables inner-city youth to embrace the arts and introduces them to career opportunities. The camp was called Camp Mariah \"for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air children,\" and she received a Congressional Horizon Award for her youth-related charity work. Carey also donated royalties from her hits \"Hero\" and \"One Sweet Day\" to charities. She is well-known nationally for her work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation in granting the wishes of children with life-threatening illnesses, and in November 2006 she was awarded the Foundation's Wish Idol for her \"extraordinary generosity and her many wish granting achievements.\" Carey has volunteered for the Police Athletic League of New York City and contributed to the obstetrics department of New York Presbyterian Hospital Cornell Medical Center. A percentage of the sales of \"MTV Unplugged\" was donated to various other charities. In 2008, Carey was named Hunger Ambassador of the World Hunger Relief Movement. In February 2010, the song, \"100%\", which was originally written and recorded for the film, \"Precious\", was used as one of the theme songs for the 2010 Winter Olympics, with all money proceeds going to Team USA.\n\nOne of Carey's most high-profile benefit concert appearances was on VH1's 1998 \"Divas Live\" special, during which she performed alongside other female singers in support of the Save the Music Foundation. The concert was a ratings success, and Carey participated in the Divas 2000 special. In 2007, the Save the Music Foundation honored Carey at their tenth gala event for her support towards the foundation since its inception. She appeared at the \"\" nationally televised fundraiser in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, and in December 2001, she performed before peacekeeping troops in Kosovo. Carey hosted the CBS television special \"At Home for the Holidays\", which documented real-life stories of adopted children and foster families. In 2005, Carey performed for Live 8 in London and at the Hurricane Katrina relief telethon \"Shelter from the Storm.\" In August 2008, Carey and other singers recorded the charity single, \"Just Stand Up\" produced by Babyface and L. A. Reid, to support Stand Up to Cancer. In 2008, Carey performed in a New Year's Eve concert for the family of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, something she later claimed to \"feel horrible and embarrassed to have participated in.\" In March 2011, Carey's representative Cindi Berger stated that royalties for the song \"Save The Day\", which was written for her fourteenth studio album, would be donated to charities that create awareness to human rights issues to make amends for the Gadaffi error. Berger also said that \"Mariah has and continues to donate her time, money and countless hours of personal service to many organizations both here and abroad.\" \"Save The Day\" was never released.\n\nDeclining offers to appear in commercials in the United States during her early career, Carey was not involved in brand marketing initiatives until 2006, when she participated in endorsements for Intel Centrino personal computers and launched a jewelry and accessories line for teenagers, Glamorized, in American Claire's and Icing stores. During this period, as part of a partnership with Pepsi and Motorola, Carey recorded and promoted a series of exclusive ringtones, including \"Time of Your Life\". She signed a licensing deal with the cosmetics company Elizabeth Arden, and in 2007, she released her own fragrance, \"M.\" The Elizabeth Arden deal has netted her $150 million. In 2007, \"Forbes\" named her as the fifth richest woman in entertainment, with an estimated net worth of US$270 million. In November 2011, it was reported that Carey's net worth was valued at more than $500 million. On November 29, 2010, she debuted a collection on HSN, which included jewelry, shoes and fragrances. In 2013, human rights activists criticized Carey for performing in a concert for Angola's \"father-daughter kleptocracy\" and accused her of accepting \"dictator cash.\"\n\nCarey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by Billie Holiday, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and R&B and soul musicians such as Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight and Aretha Franklin. Her music contains strong influences of gospel music, and she credits The Clark Sisters, Shirley Caesar and Edwin Hawkins as the most influential in her early years. When Carey incorporated hip hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told \"Newsweek\", \"People just don't understand. I grew up with this music.\" She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as The Sugarhill Gang, Eric B. & Rakim, the Wu-Tang Clan, The Notorious B.I.G. and Mobb Deep, with whom she collaborated on the single \"The Roof (Back in Time)\" (1998). Carey was heavily influenced by Minnie Riperton, and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.\n\nDuring Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to Whitney Houston, who she has also cited as an influence, and Celine Dion. Carey and her peers, according to Garry Mulholland, are \"the princesses of wails [...] virtuoso vocalists who blend chart-oriented pop with mature MOR torch song.\" Author and writer Lucy O'Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand's \"old-fashioned showgirl\" to Carey and Dion, and described them and Houston as \"groomed, airbrushed and overblown to perfection.\" Carey's musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late 1990s were, in part, initiated to distance herself from this image, and she subsequently said that most of her early work was \"schmaltzy MOR.\" Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion, Carey co-writes and produces her own songs.\n\nLove is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as racism, social alienation, death, world hunger, and spirituality. She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but \"Time\" magazine wrote: \"If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial—NutraSweet soul. But her life has passion and conflict,\" applying it to the first stages of her career. He commented that as her albums progressed, so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material. Jim Faber of the \"New York Daily News\", made similar comments, \"For Carey, vocalizing is all about the performance, not the emotions that inspired it. Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening.\" While reviewing \"Music Box\", Stephen Holden from \"Rolling Stone\" commented that Carey sang with \"sustained passion,\" while Arion Berger of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes \"too overwhelmed to put her passion into words.\" In 2001, \"The Village Voice\" wrote in regards to what they considered Carey's \"centerless ballads,\" writing, \"Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless [Diane] Warren ballads [...] it's largely because of [Blige] that the new R&B demands a greater range of emotional expression, smarter poetry, more from-the-gut testifying, and less [sic] unnecessary notes than the squeaky-clean and just plain squeaky Mariah era. Nowadays it's the Christina Aguileras and Jessica Simpsons who awkwardly oversing, while the women with roof-raising lung power keep it in check when tune or lyric demands.\"\n\nCarey's output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines, keyboards and synthesizers. Many of her songs contain piano-driven melodies, as she was given piano lessons when she was six years old. Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material, but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique. While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age, and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music, she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset: \"My voice is my instrument; it always has been.\" Carey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes. Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions, starting with \"Dreamlover\" (1993), which popularized the tradition of remixing R&B songs into house records, and which \"Slant\" magazine named one of the greatest dance songs of all time. From \"Fantasy\" (1995) onward, Carey enlisted both hip-hop and house producers to re-structure her album compositions. \"Entertainment Weekly\" included two remixes of \"Fantasy\" on a list of Carey's greatest recordings compiled in 2005: a National Dance Music Award-winning remix produced by Morales, and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard. The latter has been credited with popularizing the R&B/hip-hop collaboration trend that has continued into the 2000s, through artists such as Ashanti and Beyoncé. Combs said that Carey \"knows the importance of mixes, so you feel like you're with an artist who appreciates your work—an artist who wants to come up with something with you.\"\n\nCarey possesses a five-octave vocal range, and has the ability to reach notes beyond the 7th octave. Referred to as the \"songbird supreme\" by the \"Guinness World Records\", she was ranked first in a 2003 MTV and \"Blender\" magazine countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music, as voted by fans and readers in an online poll. Carey said of the poll, \"What it really means is voice of the MTV generation. Of course, it's an enormous compliment, but I don't feel that way about myself.\" She also placed second in \"Cove\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists.\"\n\nRegarding her voice type, Carey said that she is an alto, though several critics have described her as a Coloratura soprano. The singer claims that she has nodules in her vocal cords since childhood, due to which she can sing in a higher register than others. However, tiredness and sleep deprivation can affect her vocals due to the nodules, and Carey explained that she went through a lot of practice to maintain a balance during singing.\n\nJon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" described Carey's lower register as a \"rich, husky alto\" that extends to \"dog-whistle high notes.\" Additionally, towards the late 1990s, Carey began incorporating breathy vocals into her material. Tim Levell from the BBC News described her vocals as \"sultry close-to-the-mic breathiness,\" while \"USA Today\"s Elysa Gardner wrote \"it's impossible to deny the impact her vocal style, a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting, has had on today's young pop and R&B stars.\"\n\nSasha Frere-Jones of \"The New Yorker\" adds her timbre possesses various colors, saying, \"Carey's sound changes with nearly every line, mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid, breathy coo. Her wide vocal range allows Carey to take melodies from alto bottom notes to coloratura soprano upper register.\" Carey also possesses a \"whisper register.\" In an interview with the singer, Ron Givens of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described it this way, \"first, a rippling, soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat: alto. Then, after a quick breath, she goes for the stratosphere, with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room. In one brief swoop, she seems to squeal and roar at the same time.\"\n\nHer sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds \"she can linger over sensual turns, growl with playful confidence, syncopate like a scat singer... with startlingly exact pitch.\"\n\nCarey's vocal style and singing ability have significantly impacted popular and contemporary music. As music critic G. Brown from \"The Denver Post\" wrote, \"For better or worse, Mariah Carey's five-octave range and melismatic style have influenced a generation of pop singers.\" According to \"Rolling Stone\", \"Her mastery of melisma, the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like \"Vision of Love\", inspired the entire \"American Idol\" vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&B singer since the Nineties.\" Jody Rosen of \"Slate\" wrote of Carey's influence in modern music, calling her the most influential vocal stylist of the last two decades, the person who made rococo melismatic singing. Rosen further exemplified Carey's influence by drawing parallel with American Idol, which to her, \"often played out as a clash of melisma-mad Mariah wannabes. And, today, nearly 20 years after Carey's debut, major labels continue to bet the farm on young stars such as the winner of Britain's X Factor show, Leona Lewis, with her Generation Next gloss on Mariah's big voice and big hair.\" Sean Daly of \"St. Petersburg Times\" wrote, \"Depending on how you feel about public humiliation, the best/worst parts of American Idol are the audition shows, which normally break down into three distinct parts:(1) The Talented Kids.(2) The Weird Kids.(3) The Mariahs.\" Daly further commented, \"The Mariahs are the hardest ones to watch, mainly because most of them think they're reeeaaally good. The poor, disillusioned hopefuls plant themselves in front of judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson – then proceed to stretch, break and mutilate every note of a song, often Mariah's Hero, a tune that has ruined more throats than smoker's cough.\" \"New York Magazine's\" editor Roger Deckker said that in regarding Carey as an influential artist in music, he commented that \"Whitney Houston may have introduced melisma (the vocally acrobatic style of lending a word an extra syllable or twenty) to the charts, but it was Mariah—with her jaw-dropping range—who made it into America's default sound.\" Deckker also added that \"Every time you turn on American Idol, you are watching her children.\" Despite her vocal prowess, Carey's vocal technique particularly with the use of melisma and belting, has been subject to public scrutiny mainly because of young singers such as from talent shows have been overly imitating her singing technique in which critics commented \"Mariah Carey is, without a doubt, the worst thing to happen to amateur singing since the karaoke machine.\" As Professor Katherine L. Meizel noted in her book, \"The Mediation of Identity Politics in American Idol\", \"Carey's influence not just stops in the emulation of melisma or her singing amongst the wannabe's, it's also her persona, her diva, her stardom which inspires them... a pre-fame conic look.\"\n\nAmong the hip hop, pop, and R&B artists who have cited Carey as an influence are Aneeka, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Bridgit Mendler, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Rihanna, Grimes, Kelly Clarkson, Nelly Furtado, Bonnie McKee, Leona Lewis, Brandy Norwood, Pink, Mary J. Blige, Melanie Fiona, Missy Elliott, Sam Smith, Hikaru Utada, Regine Velasquez, Sarah Geronimo, Charice Jordin Sparks, Justin Bieber, Jessica Sanchez, and Sandy. According to Stevie Wonder, \"When people talk about the great influential singers, they talk about Aretha, Whitney and Mariah. That's a testament to her talent. Her range is that amazing.\" Beyoncé credits Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal \"runs\" as a child, as well as helping her pursue a career as a musician. Rihanna has stated that Carey is one of her major influences and idol. Aguilera said in the early stages of her career that Carey was a big influence in her singing career and one of her idols. According to Pier Dominguez, author of \"Christina Aguilera: A star is made\", Aguilera has stated how she loved listening to Whitney Houston, but it was Carey who had the biggest influence on her vocal styling. Carey's carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with Aguilera. Her influence on Aguilera also grew from the fact that both are of mixed heritage. Philip Brasor, editor of \"The Japan Times\", expressed how Carey's vocal and melismatic style even influenced Asian singers. He wrote that Japanese singer Hikaru Utada \"sang what she heard, from the diaphragm and with her own take on the kind of melisma that became de rigueur in American pop after the ascendance of Mariah Carey.\" In an article titled \"Out With Mariah's Melisma, In With Kesha's Kick\", writer David Browne of \"The New York Times\" discusses how the once ubiquitous melisma pop style suddenly lost in favor of the now ubiquitous autotune in which the former was heavily popularized by the likes of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Browne had commented \"But beginning two decades ago, melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn't before. Mariah Carey's debut hit from 1990, \"Vision of Love\", followed two years later by Whitney Houston's version of \"I Will Always Love You\", set the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder, longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard.\" Browne further added \"A subsequent generation of singers, including Ms. Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé, built their careers around melisma. (Men like Brian McKnight and Tyrese also indulged in it, but women tended to dominate the form.)\"\n\nCarey is also credited for introducing R&B and hip hop into mainstream pop culture, and for popularizing rap as a featuring act through her post-1995 songs. Sasha Frere-Jones, editor of \"The New Yorker\" commented, \"It became standard for R&B/hip-hop stars like Missy Elliott and Beyoncé, to combine melodies with rapped verses. And young white pop stars—including Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and 'N Sync—have spent much of the past ten years making pop music that is unmistakably R&B.\" Moreover Jones concludes that \"[Carey's] idea of pairing a female songbird with the leading male MCs of hip-hop changed R&B and, eventually, all of pop. Although now anyone is free to use this idea, the success of \"The Emancipation of Mimi\" suggests that it still belongs to Carey.\" Judnick Mayard, writer of \"The Fader\", wrote that in regarding of R&B and hip hop collaboration, \"The champion of this movement is Mariah Carey.\" Mayard also expressed that \"To this day ODB and Mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time,\" citing that due to the record \"Fantasy\", \"R&B and Hip-Hop were the best of step siblings.\" Kelefa Sanneh of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"In the mid-1990s Ms. Carey pioneered a subgenre that some people call the thug-love duet. Nowadays clean-cut pop stars are expected to collaborate with roughneck rappers, but when Ms. Carey teamed up with Ol' Dirty Bastard, of the Wu-Tang Clan, for the 1995 hit \"Fantasy (Remix)\", it was a surprise, and a smash.\" Aside from her pop culture and musical influence, Carey is credited for releasing a classic Christmas song called \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" In a retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of \"The New Yorker\" said, the \"charming\" song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it \"one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon.\" \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a \"holiday standard.\" In a review of her \"Greatest Hits\" album, Devon Powers of PopMatters writes that \"She has influenced countless female vocalists after her. At 32, she is already a living legend—even if she never sings another note.\" While reviewing a concert of Carey in Sydney, Elise Vout of \"MTV Australia\" wrote that \"it's not amazing choreography or high production value you're going to see, it's the larger than life personality, unique voice, and legend that is Mariah Carey.\"\n\nCarey began dating Tommy Mottola while recording \"Music Box\", and married him on June 5, 1993. After the release of \"Daydream\" and the success that followed, Carey began focusing on her personal life, which was a constant struggle at the time. Carey's relationship with Mottola began to deteriorate, due to their growing creative differences in terms of her albums, as well as his controlling nature. On May 30, 1997, the couple announced their separation, with their divorce finalized by the time Mottola remarried on December 2, 2000. Carey was in a three-year relationship with singer Luis Miguel from 1998 to 2001.\n\nCarey met actor and comedian Nick Cannon while they shot her music video for her song \"Bye Bye\" on an island off the coast of Antigua. On April 30, 2008, Carey married Cannon in The Bahamas. At 35 weeks into her pregnancy, she gave birth to their fraternal twins, Moroccan and Monroe, on April 30, 2011 via Cesarean section.\n\nIn August 2014, Cannon confirmed he and Carey had separated a few months earlier. He filed for divorce on December 12, 2014. It was finalized in 2016.\n\nOn January 21, 2016, Carey and Australian billionaire James Packer announced that they were engaged. By October, however, they had ended their engagement.\n\nCarey is an active Episcopalian. She stated in 2006: \"I do believe that I have been born again in a lot of ways. I think what I've changed are my priorities and my relationships with God. I feel the difference when I don't have my private moments to pray. ... I'm a fighter, but I learned that I'm not in charge. Whatever God wants to happen is what's going to happen. I feel like I've had endless second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth chances. It's by the grace of God I'm still here.\"\n\nIn April 2018, Carey opened up about her struggle with bipolar II disorder. She, self-reportedly, was diagnosed in 2001, but kept the diagnosis private. Recently, she has sought out treatment in the form of medication and therapy.\n\nThroughout Carey's career, she has collected many honors and awards, including the World Music Awards' Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium, the Grammy's Best New Artist in 1991, and \"Billboard\"s Special Achievement Award for the Artist of the Decade during the 1990s. In a career spanning over 20 years, Carey has sold over 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the biggest-selling artists in music history. Carey is ranked as the best-selling female artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, with over 52 million copies sold. Carey was ranked first in MTV and \"Blender\" magazine's 2003 countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music, and was placed second in \"Cove\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Outstanding Pop Vocalists.\" Aside from her voice, she has become known for her songwriting. Yahoo Music editor Jason Ankeny wrote, \"She earned frequent comparison to rivals Whitney Houston and Celine Dion, but did them both one better by composing all of her own material.\" According to \"Billboard\" magazine, she was the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States. At the 2000 World Music Awards, Carey was given a Legend Award for being the \"best-selling female pop artist of the millennium,\" as well as the \"Best-selling artist of the 90s\" in the United States, after releasing a series of albums of multiplatinum status in Asia and Europe, such as \"Music Box\" and \"Number 1's\". She is also a recipient of the Chopard Diamond award in 2003, recognizing sales of over 100 million albums worldwide. Additionally, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) lists Carey as the third-best-selling female artist, with shipments of over 63 million units in the US. In Japan, Carey has the top four highest-selling albums of all time by a non-Asian artist.\n\nCarey has spent 79 weeks at the number-one position on \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the greatest number for any artist in US chart history. On that same chart, she has accumulated 18 number-one singles, the most for any solo artist (and second after The Beatles). Carey has also had three songs debut at the top of the Hot 100 chart. In 1994, Carey released her holiday album \"Merry Christmas\" has sold over 15 million copies worldwide, and is the best-selling Christmas album of all time. It also produced the successful single \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", which became the only holiday song and ringtone to reach multi-platinum status in the US. In Japan, \"Number 1's\" has sold over 3,250,000 copies and is the best-selling album of all time in Japan by a non-Asian artist. Her hit single \"One Sweet Day\", which featured Boyz II Men, spent sixteen consecutive weeks at the top of \"Billboard\"s Hot 100 chart in 1996, setting the record for the most weeks atop the Hot 100 chart in history. After Carey's success in Asia with \"Merry Christmas\", \"Billboard\" estimated Carey as the all-time best-selling international artist in Japan. In 2008, \"Billboard\" listed \"We Belong Together\" ninth on The \"Billboard\" Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs and second on Top Billboard Hot 100 R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The song was also declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by \"Billboard\". In 2009, Carey's cover of Foreigner's song \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" became the longest-running number-one song in Brazilian singles chart history, spending 27 consecutive weeks at number-one. Additionally, Carey has had three songs debut at number-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"Fantasy\", \"One Sweet Day\" and \"Honey\", making her the artist with the most number-one debuts in the chart's 52-year history. Also, she is the first female artist to debut at number 1 in the U.S. with \"Fantasy\". In 2010, Carey's 13th album and second Christmas album, \"Merry Christmas II You\", debuted at No. 1 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it only the second Christmas album to top that chart.

{"id": "39574997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39574997", "title": "Mediated communication", "text": "Mediated communication\n\nMediated communication or mediated interaction (less often, mediated discourse) refers to communication carried out by the use of information communication technology and can be contrasted to face-to-face communication. While nowadays the technology we use is often related to computers, giving rise to the popular term computer-mediated communication, mediated technology need not be computerized as writing a letter using a pen and a piece of paper is also using mediated communication. Thus, Davis defines mediated communication as the use of any technical medium for transmission across time and space.\n\nHistorically, mediated communication was much rarer than the face-to-face method. Even though humans possessed the technology to communicate in space and time for millennia, the majority of the world's population lacked skills such as literacy to use them. This began to change in Europe with the invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg that led to the spread of printed texts and rising literacy from the 15th century. Separately, the first print culture was Chinese in origin. Whatever the tradition, face-to-face interaction has begun to steadily lose ground to mediated communication.\n\nCompared to face-to-face communication, mediated communication engages fewer senses, transmits fewer symbolic cues (most mediated communication does not transmit facial expressions) and is seen as more private. Parties usually require some technical expertise to operate the mediating technologies. New computerized media, such as mobile telephones or instant messaging, allow mediated communication to transmit more oral and nonverbal symbols than the older generation of tools.\n\nThe type of mediated technology used can also influence its meaning. This is most famously rendered in Marshall McLuhan's maxim \"the medium is the message\".\n\nLundby (2009) distinguished between three forms of mediated communication: mediated interpersonal communication, interactive communication, and mass communication. Thompson (1995), however, treated mass communication not as a part of mediated communication, but on par with mediated and face-to-face communication, terming it \"mediated quasi-interaction\".\n\nThere are only a few ways that mediated communication and face-to-face communication function similarly. One of them is that interpersonal coordination is present in both face-to-face and mediated communication. However, mediated communication has vast differences and limitations compared with face-to-face communication. Writing in communication media and speech in face-to-face communication are different in terms of their lexical density, range of grammatical structures, varied connectivity between sentences, syntax, permanence, etc. These differences in each type of communication can change the message. Texting and e-mail, for example, contain combined forms of writing and speech, which is evident by slang and shorthand. Also, no nonverbal cues can be sent through mediated communication, so received information can be harder to understand. Verbal (or textual) cues are used instead of nonverbal ones to convey the same messages.\n\nIndividuals send more information at a time through computer media than any other form of communication, including face-to-face communication. This increased rate of information transfer allows abusive forms of communication like cyberbullying and phishing to occur. The disassociation and disinhibition associated with mediated communication can cause people who are being deceived to have trouble interpreting the reactions of the deceiver since information sent through media instead of face-to-face can lose or have change the nonverbal cues within it, and, with that, signs of deception. The decreased availability of these nonverbal cues increases disassociation and anonymity. It is easier to trust someone else through mediated communication, but people with less trust can detect deception better online.\n\nBecause of the limitations of mediated communication, Nardi and Whittaker (2002) note, \"Many theorists imply that face-to-face communication is the gold standard of communication.\" Mediated communication has been, however, described as more preferable in some situations, particularly where time and geographical distance are an issue. For example, in maintaining long-distance friendship, face-to-face communication was only the fourth most common way of maintaining ties, after mediated communication tools of telephone, email and instant messaging.\n\nIndividuals will use different types of media depending on their motivations, communication purpose, institutional factors, and situational factors. Also, people will be more inclined to use a particular medium of communication if others associated with them use that medium; this is called the network effect. Motivations for using certain media are divided into strong- and weak-tie communication. There are five communication purposes: coordination, knowledge-sharing, information gathering, relationship development, and conflict resolution. Institutional factors include the physical structure of work units, social structure, and incentives. Situational factors include task characteristics, message content, and urgency.\n\nMediated communication is not as commonly used as face-to-face communication in the workplace, but there are different preferred media of communication for simple forms of coordination. E-mails and phone calls tend to be used for simple or complex coordination, but e-mails are also useful for retaining information and recording the exchange of information. In terms of communication solutions to certain situational factors, e-mails are used for recording the transfer of information and sending long, complex, and non-textual information, and phone calls and pagers are used for immediate communication. E-mails and phone calls are also used in knowledge sharing and information gathering. E-mails are rarely used to accomplish relationship goals, but they are used for conflict resolution. Individuals have a higher motivation to use cell-phone texting for weak-tie communication. The network effect has the most impact on e-mail, meaning that people tend to use e-mail more if their peers use it, too.\n\n"}
{"id": "698511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=698511", "title": "Mizrahi Jews", "text": "Mizrahi Jews\n\nMizrahi Jews, Mizrahim (), also referred to as Edot HaMizrach (; \"Communities of the East\"; Mizrahi Hebrew: '), (\"Sons of the East\"), or Oriental Jews, are descendants of local Jewish communities in the Middle East from biblical times into the modern era. They include descendants of Babylonian Jews and Mountain Jews from modern Iraq, Syria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Dagestan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Uzbekistan, the Caucasus, Kurdistan, Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. Yemenite Jews, as well as North African Jews are sometimes also included, but their histories are separate from Babylonian Jewry.\n\nThe use of the term Mizrahi can be somewhat controversial. The term Mizrahim is sometimes applied to descendants of Maghrebi and Sephardi Jews, who had lived in North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco), the Sephardi-proper communities of Turkey, and the mixed Levantine communities of Lebanon, Israel, and Syria. Before the establishment of the state of Israel, Mizrahi Jews did not identify themselves as a separate Jewish subgroup. Instead, Mizrahi Jews generally characterized themselves as \"Sephardi\", as they follow the traditions of Sephardi Judaism (but with some differences among the \"minhag\" \"customs\" of particular communities). That has resulted in a conflation of terms, particularly in Israel and in religious usage, with \"Sephardi\" being used in a broad sense and including Mizrahi Jews and North African Jews as well as Sephardim proper. From the point of view of the official Israeli rabbinate, any rabbis of Mizrahi origin in Israel are under the jurisdiction of the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel.\n\nAs of 2005, 61% of Israeli Jews were of full or partial Mizrahi ancestry.\n\n\"Mizrahi\" is literally translated as \"Oriental\", \"Eastern\", \"Mizraḥ\", Hebrew for \"east\". In Arabic, \"Misr\" means Egypt; and that is also the term used for Egypt in the Bible. In the past the word \"Mizrahim\", corresponding to the Arabic word \"Mashriqiyyun\" (Easterners), referred to the natives of Kurdistan, Iraq and other Asian countries, as distinct from those of North Africa (\"Maghribiyyun\"). In medieval and early modern times, the corresponding Hebrew word \"ma'arav\" was used for North Africa. In Talmudic and Geonic times, however, this word \"ma'arav\" referred to the land of Israel, as contrasted with Babylonia. For this reason, many object to the use of \"Mizrahi\" to include Moroccan and other North African Jews.\n\nThe term Mizrahim or \"Edot Hamizraḥ\", Oriental communities, grew in Israel under the circumstances of the meeting of waves of Jewish immigrants from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, followers of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Temani (Yemenite) rites. In modern Israeli usage, it refers to all Jews from Central and West Asian countries, many of them Arabic-speaking Muslim-majority countries. The term came to be widely used more by Mizrahi activists in the early 1990s. Since then in Israel it has become an accepted semi-official and media designation.\n\nMost of the \"Mizrahi\" activists actually originated from North African Jewish communities, traditionally called \"Westerners\" (Maghrebi), rather than \"Easterners\" (Mashreqi). Many Jews originated from Arab and Muslim countries today reject \"Mizrahi\" (or any) umbrella description, and prefer to identify themselves by their particular country of origin, or that of their immediate ancestors, e. g., \"Moroccan Jew\", or prefer to use the old term \"Sephardi\" in its broader meaning. Some modern Arab Muslims and Christians are probably descendants of biblical/ancient Jews who later converted to Christianity and Islam. \n\nToday, many identify all non-Ashkenazi rite Jews as Sephardi - in modern Hebrew \"Sfaradim\", mixing ancestral origin and religious rite. This broader definition of \"Sephardim\" as including all, or most, Mizrahi Jews is also common in Jewish religious circles. During the past century, the Sephardi rite absorbed the unique rite of the Yemenite Jews, and lately, Beta Israel religious leaders in Israel have also joined Sefardi rite collectivities, especially following rejection of their Jewishness by some Ashkenazi circles.\n\nThe reason for this classification of all Mizrahim under Sephardi rite is that most Mizrahi communities use much the same religious rituals as Sephardim proper due to historical reasons. The prevalence of the Sephardi rite among Mizrahim is partially a result of Sephardim proper joining some of Mizrahi communities following the 1492 Alhambra Decree, which expelled Jews from Sepharad (Spain and Portugal). Over the last few centuries, the previously distinctive rites of the Mizrahi communities were influenced, superimposed upon or altogether replaced by the rite of the Sephardim, perceived as more prestigious. Even before this assimilation, the original rite of many Jewish Oriental communities was already closer to the Sephardi rite than to the Ashkenazi one. For this reason, \"Sephardim\" has come to mean not only \"Spanish Jews\" proper but \"Jews of the Spanish rite\", just as \"Ashkenazim\" is used for \"Jews of the German rite\", whether or not their families originate in Germany.\n\nMany of the Sephardi Jews exiled from Spain resettled in greater or lesser numbers in the Arab world, such as Syria and Morocco. In Syria, most eventually intermarried with, and assimilated into, the larger established communities of Musta'rabim and Mizrahim. In some North African countries, such as Morocco, Sephardi Jews came in greater numbers, and largely contributed to the Jewish settlements that the pre-existing Jews were assimilated by them. Either way, this assimilation, combined with the use of the Sephardi rite, led to the popular designation and conflation of most non-Ashkenazi Jewish communities from the Middle East and North Africa as \"Sephardi rite\", whether or not they were descended from Spanish Jews, which is what the terms \"Sephardi Jews\" and \"Sfaradim\" properly implied when used in the ethnic as opposed to the religious sense.\n\nIn some Arabic countries, such as Egypt and Syria, Sephardi Jews arrived via the Ottoman Empire would distinguish themselves from the already established Musta'rabim, while in others, such as Morocco and Algeria, the two communities largely intermarried, with the latter embracing Sephardi customs and thus forming a single community.\n\nIn the Arab world (such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria), Mizrahim most often speak Arabic, although Arabic is now mainly used as a second language, especially by the older generation. Most of the many notable philosophical, religious and literary works of the Jews in Spain, North Africa and Asia were written in Arabic using a modified Hebrew alphabet.\n\nAramaic is a Semitic language subfamily. Specific varieties of Aramaic are identified as \"Jewish languages\" since they are the languages of major Jewish texts such as the Talmud and \"Zohar\", and many ritual recitations such as the Kaddish. Traditionally, Aramaic has been a language of Talmudic debate in yeshivot, as many rabbinic texts are written in a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic. The current Hebrew alphabet, known as \"Assyrian lettering\" or \"the square script\", was in fact borrowed from Aramaic.\n\nIn Kurdistan, the language of the Mizrahim is a variant of Aramaic. As spoken by the Kurdish Jews, Judeo-Aramaic languages are Neo-Aramaic languages descended from Jewish Babylonian Aramaic. They are related to the Christian Aramaic dialects spoken by Assyrian people.\n\nIn 2007, a book was published, authored by Mordechai Zaken, describing the unique relationship between Jews in urban and rural Kurdistan and the tribal society under whose patronage the Jews lived for hundreds of years. Tribal chieftains, or aghas, granted patronage to the Jews who needed protection in the wild tribal region of Kurdistan; the Jews gave their chieftains dues, gifts and services. The text provides numerous tales and examples about the skills, maneuvers and innovations used by Kurdistani Jews in their daily life to confront their abuse and extortion by greedy chieftains and tribesmen. The text also tells the stories of Kurdish chieftains who saved and protected the Jews unconditionally.\n\nBy the early 1950s, virtually the entire Jewish community of Kurdistan — a rugged, mostly mountainous region comprising parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and the Caucasus, where Jews had lived since antiquity — relocated to Israel. The vast majority of Kurdish Jews, who were primarily concentrated in northern Iraq, left Kurdistan in the mass aliyah of 1950-51. This ended thousands of years of Jewish history in what had been Assyria and Babylonia.\n\nAmong other languages associated with Mizrahim are Judeo-Iranian languages such as Judeo-Persian, the Bukhori dialect, Judeo-Tat, and Kurdish languages; Georgian; Marathi; and Judeo-Malayalam. Most Persian Jews speak standard Persian, as do many other Jews from Iran, Afghanistan, and Bukhara (Uzbekistan), Judeo-Tat, a form of Persian, is spoken by the Mountain Jews of Azerbaijan and Russian Dagestan, and in other Caucasian territories in Russia.\n\nSome Mizrahim migrated to India, other parts of Central Asia, and China. In some Mizrahi Jewish communities (notably those of Yemen and Iran), polygyny has been practiced.\n\nAfter the establishment of the State of Israel and subsequent 1948 Arab–Israeli War, most Mizrahim were either expelled by their Arab rulers or chose to leave and emigrated to Israel. According to the 2009 Statistical Abstract of Israel, 50.2% of Israeli Jews are of Mizrahi or Sephardi origin.\n\nAnti-Jewish actions by Arab governments in the 1950s and 1960s, in the context of the founding of the State of Israel, led to the departure of large numbers of Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East. The exodus of 25,000 Mizrahi Jews from Egypt after the 1956 Suez Crisis led to the overwhelming majority of Mizrahim leaving Arab countries. They became refugees. Most went to Israel. Many Moroccan and Algerian Jews went to France. Thousands of Lebanese, Syrian and Egyptian Jews emigrated to the United States and to Brazil.\n\nToday, as many as 40,000 Mizrahim still remain in communities scattered throughout the non-Arab Muslim world, primarily in Iran, but also Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. There are few Maghrebim remaining in the Arab world. About 5,000 remain in Morocco and fewer than 2,000 in Tunisia. Other countries with remnants of ancient Jewish communities with official recognition, such as Lebanon, have 100 or fewer Jews. A trickle of emigration continues, mainly to Israel and the United States.\n\nRefuge in Israel was not without its tragedies: \"In a generation or two, millennia of rooted Oriental civilization, unified even in its diversity\", had been wiped out, writes Mizrahi scholar Ella Shohat. The trauma of rupture from their countries of origin was further complicated by the difficulty of the transition upon arrival in Israel; Mizrahi immigrants and refugees were placed in rudimentary and hastily erected tent cities (Ma'abarot) often in development towns on the peripheries of Israel. Settlement in Moshavim (cooperative farming villages) was only partially successful, because Mizrahim had historically filled a niche as craftsmen and merchants and most did not traditionally engage in farmwork. As the majority left their property behind in their home countries as they journeyed to Israel, many suffered a severe decrease in their socio-economic status aggravated by their cultural and political differences with the dominant Ashkenazi community. Furthermore, a policy of austerity was enforced at that time due to economic hardships.\n\nMizrahi immigrants arrived with many mother tongues:\nMizrahim from elsewhere brought Georgian, Judaeo-Georgian and various other languages with them. Hebrew had historically been a language only of prayer for most Jews not living in Israel, including the Mizrahim. Thus, with their arrival in Israel, the Mizrahim retained culture, customs and language distinct from their Ashkenazi counterparts.\n\nThe cultural differences between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews impacted the degree and rate of assimilation into Israeli society, and sometimes the divide between Eastern European and Middle Eastern Jews was quite sharp. Segregation, especially in the area of housing, limited integration possibilities over the years. Intermarriage between Ashkenazim and Mizrahim is increasingly common in Israel and by the late 1990s 28% of all Israeli children had multi-ethnic parents (up from 14% in the 1950s). It has been claimed that intermarriage does not tend to decrease ethnic differences in socio-economic status, however that does not apply to the children of inter-ethnic marriages.\n\nAlthough social integration is constantly improving, disparities persist. A study conducted by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (ICBS), Mizrahi Jews are less likely to pursue academic studies than Ashkenazi Jews. Israeli-born Ashkenazim are up to twice more likely to study in a university than Israeli-born Mizrahim. Furthermore, the percentage of Mizrahim who seek a university education remains low compared to second-generation immigrant groups of Ashkenazi origin, such as Russians. According to a survey by the Adva Center, the average income of Ashkenazim was 36 percent higher than that of Mizrahim in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This examination was done in accordance with NCAA policy that requires each member institution to maintain an \"atmosphere of respect for and sensitivity to the dignity of every person.\" Fourteen schools either removed all references to Native American culture or were deemed not to have references to Native American culture as part\nof their athletics programs. Subsequently, 19 teams were cited as having potentially \"hostile or abusive\" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments.\n\nColleges previously using the nickname \"Indians\" changed:\n\nCalifornia State University, Stanislaus eliminated Native American references to their Warrior nickname, initially using a Warrior Hawk mascot which never caught on; it has been replaced by a Roman Warrior, Titus. The College of William and Mary (W&M) had previously changed from \"Indians\" to The Tribe, but was cited due to two feathers in its logo, which were removed. After a brief period of having the frog-like character Colonel Ebirt as its unofficial mascot, W&M selected the Griffin in 2010. Both Alcorn State University and Bradley University kept the nickname Braves but changed their mascots, while the Chowan University Braves became the Hawks. The Carthage College Redmen became the Red Men, and the Southeastern Oklahoma State University Savages changed to Savage Storm.\n\nSan Diego State University was not cited by the NCAA in 2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe with any living descendants. However, the Aztec Warrior whose performance has included human sacrifice, has drawn criticism. A SDSU professor of American Indian Studies states that among other problems the mascot teaches the mistaken idea that the Aztecs were a local tribe rather than living in Mexico 1,000 miles away. However, in February 2017 the SDSU Native American Student Alliance (NASA) supports removal of the mascot, calling its continue use \"institutional racism\" in its official statement to the Committee on Diversity, Equity and Outreach. Although that resolution was rejected by the SDSU Associated Students, the University Senate, which represents the administration, faculty, staff and students, has voted to phase out the human depiction of the Aztec Warrior. A task force of students, faculty, and alumni will study the issue and make a recommendation by April, 2018.\n\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Fighting Illini kept the nickname as referring to the state, not Native Americans, but officially stopped using the Chief Illiniwek image and mascot in 2007, although an attachment remains among many students and alumni; but not all. The \"Honor the Chief Society\" filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2009 to register the Chief Illiniwek symbol, which the university opposed. In October, 2013 an agreement was reached that will allow limited private use of the name as long as accompanied by a disclaimer stating that the university is not involved in such use. A new Chief Illiniwek cannot be named, and the university retains control of the name. However, an \"unofficial\" chief has been selected by former Chief Illiniwek portrayers.\n\nThe University of North Dakota initially challenged the NCAA policy in court, but settled in 2007 when it was given three years to obtain consent from the Sioux tribes in the state. When one tribe refused permission, the state Board of Higher Education proceeded with plans to eliminate the Fighting Sioux name and logo. In 2011, the State Legislature voted that the university should retain the name but in a 2012 referendum the voters decided to proceed with the change, which has been completed but no alternative nickname or logo has been selected. The NCAA has agreed to allow some of the logos to remain in the sports stadiums, while removing the larger and more obvious ones. Additional legal cases have run their course, leaving the Fighting Sioux name and logo officially retired. The 2012 referendum specified that there would be a cooling off period during which a new nickname would not be selected, which ended on January 1, 2015. After a year-long selection process, \"Fighting Hawks\" was selected as the new nickname on November 18, 2015. Initially many fans, particularly at hockey games, continued to wear \"Sioux\" jerseys and boo when the \"Fighting Hawks\" is used. After a year, however, new Fighting Hawks merchandise is being sold. \nThe NCAA has granted waivers from their mascot policy to five university teams originally on the \"hostile and abusive\" list that obtained official support from individual tribes for the use of their names and images, based upon the principle of Tribal Sovereignty. As stated by the NCAI: \"In general, NCAI strongly opposes the use of derogatory Native sports mascots. However, in the case where mascots refer to a particular Native nation or nations, NCAI respects the right of individual tribal nations to work with universities and athletic programs to decide how to protect and celebrate their respective tribal heritage.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11734374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11734374", "title": "Organized crime in Nigeria", "text": "Organized crime in Nigeria\n\nOrganized crime in Nigeria may refer to a number of fraudsters, drug traffickers and racketeers of various sorts originating from Nigeria. Nigerian criminal gangs rose to prominence in the 1980s, owing much to the globalization of the world's economies and the high level of lawlessness already in the country.\n\nCriminal organizations from Nigeria typically do not follow the mafia-type model followed by other groups. They appear to be less formal and more organized along familial and ethnic lines, thus making them less susceptible by infiltration from law enforcement. Police investigations are further hampered by the fact there are at least 250 distinct ethnic languages in Nigeria. Other criminal gangs from Nigeria appear to be smaller-scale freelance operations. Groups from Benin City are especially notorious for human trafficking.\n\nAn example of this are the highly organized confraternities/campus gangs that operate worldwide, for example the Neo Black Movement of Africa. In its own words, the Neo Black Movement of Africa is a \"registered non-partisan, non-religious and non-tribal organisation that sincerely seek to revive, retain and modify where necessary those aspects of African culture that would provide vehicles of progress for Africa and her peoples\".\n\nThe current worldwide head of the Neo Black Movement is Augustus Bemigho-Oyeoyibo. A representative of the Neo Black Movement of Africa has claimed to be separate from the Black Axe groups and has engaged in charitable giving.\n\nBehind the welfare facade of the Neo Black Movement hides indeed the most dreaded Nigerian campus cult, the Black Axe confraternity. NBM usually state that they are not identical with Black Axe for propaganda purposes. While the atrocities committed by campus cult members are well-known, very little is known about other activities of the Neo Black Movement. Offiong claims that the group's initial goal of promoting black consciousness and fighting for the dignity of Africans and their freedom from neo-colonialism has deteriorated into self-serving behaviour that is \"notoriously and brutally violent\". He maintains that violence has in fact become the cult's official policy.\n\nApart from the atrocities in the orbit of NBM, most members of the confraternity are involved in fraud and cyber crime. The main reason to join the confraternity is (besides the pressure and intimidation that is applied to students to join) the fact that the confraternity has infiltrated all spheres of Nigerian society and serves the main purpose of helping its members climb the career ladder and going unpunished for their crimes by means of their nepotistic structure.\n\nInvestigations and a number of arrests of members of NBM by the Italian police brought to light various crimes committed by members of NBM. NBM and other cults were found guilty of smuggling of drugs, extortion, 419 fraud, prostitution, passport falsification, and cloning of credit cards.\n\nIn 2011, eight more members of NBM were arrested in Italy for the same offenses mentioned above. They are referred to as an international criminal organisation and Nigerian Mafia. According to internal documents, the confraternity helps members to immigrate illegally to Europe. Nigerian fraud rings have been exported to Europe, America, and Asia (see external links section). In 2015 a sophisticated car theft ring run by the Black Axe organized crime ring was busted in Toronto, Canada. The ring had stolen more than 500 luxury cars in one year, valued at 30 million US dollars.\n\nNigerian criminal groups are heavily involved in drug trafficking, shipping heroin from Asian countries to Europe and America; and cocaine from South America to Europe and South Africa. The large numbers of ethnic Nigerians in countries like India and Thailand give their gangs ready access to around 90% of the world's heroin.\n\nIn the United States, Nigerian drug traffickers are important distributors of heroin, from importing it into the country to distribution level and selling it to lower-level street gangs. These criminal groups are also known to launder drug money through domestic football clubs in the Nigeria Premier League, and are rumored to make additional money through match fixing activity within football matches.\n\nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Nigerian criminal enterprises are the most notable of all African criminal enterprises. They are considered to be among the most aggressive and expansionist international criminal groups, operating in more than 80 countries of the world and are established on all populated continents of the world. Their most profitable activity is drug trafficking, though they are more famous for their financial fraud which costs the US alone approximately US$1 to 2 billion annually.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40934559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40934559", "title": "Portuguese immigration to Hawaii", "text": "Portuguese immigration to Hawaii\n\nPortuguese immigration to Hawaii began in 1878 when Portuguese residents made up less than 1% of the Island population. However, the migration that began that year of laborers from Madeira and the Azores to work in the sugarcane plantations rapidly increased the Portuguese presence in Hawaii, and by the end of 1911 nearly 16,000 Portuguese immigrants had arrived.\n\nThe Hawaiian census of 1878 showed that, out of a kingdom of 57,985 people, only 438 residents, which was less than 0.8% of the population, were Portuguese. Most of these Portuguese residents had been born in either the Azores or Madeira Islands, and nearly all had arrived as sailors on whaling ships. Although only a few brought their wives or were joined by them later, women made up only about one-eighth of this tiny immigrant community. Despite the fact that prior to 1878 so few Portuguese had made their way to the Hawaiian Islands, those that did found opportunity and tended to stay.\n\nConditions in Hawaii in 1878 were conducive to immigration. King Kalākaua, who had recently ascended the Hawaiian throne, encouraged closer ties with Europe, and a growing Hawaiian economy, due largely to increased sugar exports to California, created a demand for laborers to work the sugarcane plantations. Because the native Hawaiian workers had been decimated by disease, there were not enough laborers to supply the sugarcane plantations, which led in 1852 to the first importation of Chinese workers. So many Chinese were brought in that by 1878 they made up nearly 10% of the population. Although the Chinese worked hard, they were accused of gambling, prostitution and opium use, and a search began for alternate sources of labor. This led both the Hawaiian government and the plantation owners to offer incentives, and concessions not given the Chinese nor other Asian ethnic groups, to attract immigrants of European descent who were willing to work in the cane fields.\n\nJason Perry (Jacinto Pereira), a Portuguese settler who served as the Portuguese Consul to Hawaii, suggested in 1876 to plantation owners of the Planters' Society (a predecessor of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association) that the Madeira and Azores Islands of Portugal might be ideal sources of reliable workers. Portuguese colonists had first settled these islands in the Middle Ages, and the terrain and subtropical climate were very similar to that of the Hawaiian Islands. More important though, sugarcane had been the mainstay of the economy in Madeira and the Azores for over 400 years, and most of the population was involved in one way or another in the sugarcane industry.\n\nIntrigued by Perry's suggestion, the Planters' Society began recruiting Portuguese contract workers, first in 1878 from the Madeira Islands, and then two years later from the Azores as well. Several ships between 1878 and 1887 brought to Hawaii more than 3,300 Portuguese men from these islands, but because many of the men brought their wives, children, and other relations as well, there was an actual immigration during these years of about 10,700 Portuguese. Whereas contracts for the Chinese workers that preceded them generally stipulated single men only, the Portuguese were allowed to bring their families, an incentive that the plantation owners hoped would provide stability. Prior to independence in 1975, many Cape Verdeans emigrated to Hawaii from drought-stricken Portuguese Cape Verde, formerly an overseas province of Portugal. Because these people arrived using their Portuguese passports, they were registered as Portuguese immigrants by the Hawaiian (and later, the American) authorities.\n\nPortuguese immigration to the islands slowed after 1887, which was the same year that King Kalākaua was stripped of power, and about the same time that importation of other ethnic groups increased. Nonetheless, Portuguese immigration continued, and by the end of 1911 almost 16,000 Portuguese had arrived. Unfortunately, the more affluent members of Hawaiian society tended to view these newcomers as inferior or \"low class\", and growing resentment at being treated as \"second-class citizens\", resulted in many Portuguese later emigrating to the mainland United States, particularly California, in search of equality and opportunity. Though many left, many stayed and by 1910 Portuguese residents made up 11.6% of the population of Hawaii.\n\nNative Hawaiian speakers called the Portuguese immigrants who came to their country \"Pukikī.\" These newcomers were devout followers of the Roman Catholic faith with strong family ties. Most were short, with slender builds, and dark skin from long hours of working out under the sun in the cane fields. Many in fact were so dark that their race on some of the early U.S. census returns is listed as black, which contributed to prejudice against them. Because few of these immigrants could read or write, they had strong oral traditions, and they retained much of the culture and traditions they brought with them.\n\nOne popular Portuguese tradition in Hawaii today is the making of malasadas, which are deep-fried pastries, similar to the beignet of New Orleans, that traditionally have no holes or fillings, but are coated in granulated cane sugar. They were first made by Hawaiian residents from the Madeira and Azores Islands, who would use up butter and sugar prior to Lent by cooking malasadas. These pastries are an important part in Madeira and the Azores of the \"Terça-feira Gorda\", a festival also known as the Carnaval that is the same holiday as \"Fat Tuesday\" or \"Mardi Gras\" elsewhere. This day in Hawaii is called \"Malasada Day\", and it dates back to the time of the 19th-century sugarcane plantations.\n\nAnother popular Portuguese tradition in Hawaii is the Holy Spirit Festival (Festa do Espírito Santo), which since 1901 is celebrated each May with a parade and feast. This three-day event is not an official church holiday, but a traditional observance that began in the 18th century with the Cult of the Holy Spirit in the Azores. It usually starts on a Friday night, followed on Saturday by decorating religious statues for the festivities to follow. Then on Sunday a young woman is chosen as Queen Isabel the 6th queen of Portugal, and she and her court lead a colorful parade. The final event is a mass with a \"Blessing of the meat and bread\" by a priest, after which Isabel is crowned as the Holy Ghost Queen. A feast is then held in \"a tradition of charity and feeding the poor,\" where food is served to all present. The foods of this feast typically include malasadas (pastries), paodoce (sweet bread), bean soup, Portuguese sausages, and bowls of beef and fish marinated in wine.\n\nThe best-known Portuguese contribution to Hawaiian culture is the ukulele, based on the traditional Portuguese braguinha (cavaquinho). The introduction of the ukulele is generally credited to Madeiran cabinet makers Manuel Nunes, Augusto Dias and José do Espírito Santo, who came to the Islands in 1879 on the British clipper SS \"Ravenscrag\". The Hawaiian Gazette in late August 1879, two weeks after the arrival of the \"Ravenscrag\", reported that \"Madeira Islanders recently arrived here have been delighting the people with nightly street concerts.\" The article then mentions \"their strange instruments, which are a kind of cross between a guitar and banjo.\"\n\nAt least 24 different ships from 1878 to 1911 brought almost 16,000 Portuguese immigrants to Hawaii. Although mainly from Madeira and the Azores, there were also contingents from the eastern United States, mainland Portugal, and from the Portuguese community of Montevideo, Uruguay. Although conditions on board these ships from 1882 on improved dramatically, as most immigrants by then came by steamship, the first arrivals to Hawaii from Madeira and the Azores spent up to three months at sea in cramped quarters on sailing ships. Strong currents crossing the Atlantic, and rough seas when coming around Cape Horn at the tip of South America made for a perilous voyage. When the SS \"Ravenscrag\" reached port with its load of immigrants in 1879 after 123 days at sea, three children had perished during the voyage. Even three years later when the first group of immigrants to reach Hawaii by steamship arrived in 1882 on the SS \"Monarch\" after 57 days at sea, 13 children had died on the voyage.\n\nShips that brought Portuguese settlers to Hawaii from 1878-1912\n\nThere were also 960 Spanish immigrants on the \"Orteric\", which leaves a net importation of 15,969 Portuguese immigrants.\n\nAlthough Portuguese sailors probably visited Hawaii as early as 1794, the earliest Portuguese immigrant of whom there is official record, and the first Portuguese immigrant of note, was Dr. João (John) Elliott de Castro, who arrived in 1814 and became the personal physician, and retainer King Kamehameha I. Since Castro's day there have been many Portuguese-Hawaiians of note, some of whom are listed below.\n\n\n"}

The majority who receive an exemption from the obligatory army service are Jewish women from the Religious Zionist sector, and they receive it by declaring religious observance, as they maintain that a large number of religious observances for women cannot be upheld in the military, such as dress codes and modesty issues. However, there are also a small number of men who serve in Sherut Leumi. Volunteers are between the ages of 18 and 21. Sherut Leumi gives young women (and occasionally young men) exposure to a number of environments in Israeli society. Service typically requires working 30–40 hours/week over 12 to 24 months. Volunteers have the option of doing either one or two years of the National Service. Not all volunteers are Israeli citizens. It can be done on a tourist visa, and the volunteer will later receive a special volunteer visa that lasts as long as the person will be doing their service.\n\nYoung people in other sectors of Israeli society receive exemptions from the military. These include mainly Haredi men who maintain that Torah study is the main practice for defending Israel; they are exempted under the Torato Omanuto arrangements. Arab citizens of Israel are also exempted, in order to avoid a conflict between allegiance to their country and to their Arab brothers (a decision originally taken by Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion). Historically, very few did, but in recent years, the number of Arab youths volunteering for national service has increased. Some Israeli conscientious objectors who object to serving in the army, but are not eligible for an exemption, have voiced a wish to do an alternative form of national service instead.\n\nIn 2012, after much discussion and debate, Israel's cabinet extended military service exemption for 1,300 Haredi Yeshiva students as part of the \"Shirut Le'umi Mishmar\". This allows Yeshiva students to join national service, as opposed to joining the IDF. As part of the scheme, the defense minister is obliged to postpone the military service of Yeshiva students approved for national civil service, and who are at least 26 years old, or are at least 22 years old and have at least one child.\n\nYouths work in various programs. The majority work in schools, but can also work in places such as special education, administration, hospitals, law, geriatrics, nursing homes, health clinics, teens at risk, internal security, disadvantaged communities, immigrant assistance, and many other organizations. Acceptance is based on an interview via a placement organizations that try to find the youth appropriate skills, interests, and needs.\n\nThere are four main placement organizations for Sherut Leumi. They are the Agudah LeHitnadvut (\"lit.\" Volunteering Union), Shlomit, Aminadav, and Bat Ami. Each volunteer is then assigned to a coordinator (\"rakezet\"), who serves as a supervisor and adviser for the youth throughout their time in Sherut Leumi.\n\nBnot Sherut (lit., female youth in the service) and Bnei Sherut (lit., male youth in the service) are entitled to a number of benefits during their service. Many of these benefits are the same as what a soldier serving in the army receives. They include:\n\nRather than volunteer for army service, young people who are Arab citizens of Israel have the option to volunteer for this alternative national service and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. there were 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counseling youths to refrain from performing services to the Israeli state. According to a National Service official, \"For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state's call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits\".\n\n\n"}

They live today in the Tolna and Baranya counties of Hungary, in Hunedoara County in Romania and in the Serbian province of Vojvodina.\n\nSome Székely groups migrated from Transylvania to the province of Bukovina in the second half of the 18th century and established new villages, where they retained their distinctive culture and folk traditions into the 20th century. The migration was a reaction to the organization by the Habsburg Empire of the Székely Frontier Zone, which jeopardized certain of the Székelys' ancient privileges and rights. The Székelys protested specifically against the forced military conscription at a gathering at Madéfalva (today Siculeni), which was forcibly dispersed by the Austrian General Josef Siskovics on 7 January 1764, in what came to be known as the \"Siculicidium\" or Massacre of the Székelys. More than 400 Székelys died. Thereafter about 1000 Székelys migrated to Bukovina, then part of Moldavia and still under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire.\nThe occupation of northern Bukovina by Austria in 1774 brought a further wave of Székely immigration: another 100 families settled in the still sparsely populated territory in 1776, followed by a further 200 in 1784 and 1786, with assistance from Emperor Joseph II of Austria and Count András Hadik, governor of Transylvania. The new Bukovina Székely villages were named Istensegíts (\"God help us\", now Ţibeni), Fogadjisten (\"God, welcome us!\", now ), Józseffalva (now Vornicenii Mari), Hadikfalva (now Dornești) and Andrásfalva (now Măneuţi).\n\nThe Székelys of Bukovina maintained an archaic Hungarian folklore because of their isolation.\n\nThe population of the Bukovina Székelys tripled in the 19th century, reaching 9887 in 1880 and about 16000 by the end of the 1930s. This caused an acute shortage of farmland and a sharp fall in standards of living. Many Bukovina Székelys left the villages temporarily or permanently, some with official assistance. The Hungarian government settled 4000 of these impoverished Székelys along the Lower Danube in the new villages of Hertelendyfalva, Sándoregyháza and Székelykeve in 1883, in a part of the Banat that was annexed by Yugoslavia in 1918 and today belongs to Serbia. Other Székely families emigrated in that period to Canada, USA, Brazil or cities in southern Transylvania.\n\nBukovina became part of Romania under the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, and the impoverished Székelys soon found themselves oppressed culturally as well as economically, with no teaching in or of Hungarian in their schools. There was a general expectation of assistance from the \"mother country\" and increasing urgency after the Second Vienna Award of 1940 had caused widespread anti-Hungarian feeling in Bukovina. Hungary's 1941 invasion of Bačka (Bácska) in northwestern Vojvodina was followed quickly by the expulsion of postwar Serbian settlers and other measures of forced Magyarization, including resettlement of the Bukovina Székelys to the region. The whole community of 13,200 people left Romania under a treaty concluded between Hungary and Romania, by which the Bukovina Székelys lost their Romanian citizenship and almost all their possessions, receiving the confiscated possessions of displaced Serbs in Bačka and some charitable assistance in exchange. They were not resettled in their original village communities as they had expected, but spread about in small groups among 14 villages and hamlets. (Those from Andrásfalva, for example, belonged to the Reformed Church, while the others were Roman Catholics.)\n\nThe resettlement was short-lived. The tide of war turned and Hungary hurriedly evacuated Bačka on 8 October 1944. Most of the Bukovina Székelys managed to flee to Transdanubia before the vengeful Yugoslav partisan forces arrived, but again, they lost all of their property. Most were resettled in 1945-46 in the homes of expelled German in villages in the Völgység district of Tolna and adjacent counties. Tensions between them and the residual German population have eased over the decades. The Székelys of Tolna remain proud of their history and folk customs.\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, Awori are found in two Nigerian States: Ogun and Lagos.\nThe Awori people migrated from Ile Ife and occupied the present day Lagos state. Post-colonial creation of States and local governments influenced the splitting of the homogenous people into the present Ogun and Lagos States in South-western Nigeria. Awori towns in Ogun State are Otta, Igbesa, Ilobi and Tigbo.\n\nThe traditional territory of the Awori extends from latitude 60 30’ N from the extreme east and a landmass along the coast is over 350,000 hectares (3,500 km2) with less than twenty percent made up of lagoons, creeks and coastal estuaries.\n\nThe Awori could be grouped into two major divisions. These are the early Awori and the latter Awori groups. Among the early Awori group of settlement are Isheri, Otto-Olofin, Iddo, Ebute Metta, Apa, Ibereko as well as Otta and Ado-Odo in Ogun state of Nigeria. A common feature of these settlements is that they were founded before 1500. They also have a related migratory history and recognise Ogunfunminire as their progenitor. The later settlement include Ojo, Itire, Mushin, Iba, Otto-Awori, Ijanikin, Ilogbo Elegba, Ilogbo-Eremi, Iworo, Agbara, Ilashe etc. all of which are post 1500 settlements.\n\nThe Awori whose ancestral home is Isheri-Olofin were in Lagos before the Benin invasion as propounded by the Olofin Adimula of Orile Isheri and supported by other Awori groups such as Apa, Ilogbo-Eremi, Ibereko, Oto, Ota, Ado-Odo and Igbesa. Post-independence political creation of States however saw the dispersal of the homogenous clan scattered around the present Ogun and Lagos State.\nAwori is generally considered to be the earliest dominant tribe in Lagos, even though the throne for the Oba of Lagos had its origin from Benin. \n\nIn an interview with \"The Punch\", Nigerian lawyer and elder statesman, Lateef Olufemi Okunnu described the Aworis as being the original inhabitants of Lagos State. He noted that they settled in Lagos about half a century ago, long before the Bini invasion of Lagos.\n\nSola Ebiseni, a former commissioner for environment in Ondo State and Awori-born legal practitioner in a publication for Vanguard, emphasized that early Awori territories in Lagos was governed through the Idejo chiefs, who had policies that ensured possession and increase of their land. He historically cited Awori as the second most populous indigenous tribe in Lagos, only surpassed by Ilaje people. Significant populations were described to have settled in Apapa, Ajegunle, Makoko, Iwaya, Bariga, Oko Baba, Oto, Ebute-Metta, Oyingbo, Ijora, Igbo Elejo, Ojo, Aloro Island (off the coast of Kirikiri) Ajah, Badore, Iton Agan, Oworonsoki, Agboyi, Bayeku etc.\n\nIn 2017, Erelu Kuti of Lagos, Abiola Dosunmu controversially refuted claims that the Awori's were the original \"owners\" of Lagos. She described Lagos as firstly being an \"extension of the Benin kingdom\". She also stated that after the emigration of the Awori tribe from Ife, they were initially paying royalties to the Oba of Benin. Her position was also corroborated by Oba of Lagos, who earlier espoused the significance of Bini in the creation of Lagos. \n\nThe Awori constitute the bulk of the indigenous population of sixteen, out of the twenty local government areas of Lagos State as at the year 2003, the only exceptions being Epe, Ikorodu and IbejuLekki with minimal Awori inhabitants. In these areas, they have developed many kingdoms and chiefdoms. Speaking against a proposed Lagoon State, Awori Welfare Association of Nigeria (AWAN) advocated for more local governments for Aworiland, instead of creation of more states as marginalization of minorities will come to play if done. They also identified the insensitivity of the actors due to lack of consultation as a reason for their refusal. Apapa, Iganmu, Somolu, Bariga, Akoka, Eti-Okun, Iwerekun, Kosofe, Agboyi, Ketu, Obalende/lkoyi, Iru/Victoria Island, Eti-Osa East, Eti-Osa West, Eti-Osa Central, Etikun, Ibeshe and Majidun towns were described as Aworiland in the proposed state.\n\nThe Awori people in Ogun State are located in Ogun West senatorial district, a portion that represents 37 percent of the entire area and 31% of the population in the state.\n"}

According to their oral traditions and some scholars, they are Arabs who migrated from the Arabian peninsula to Central Sudan either by way of North Africa and Tunis or by way of Nubia. In fact, as Nachtigal observed they resemble in features and behaviour the Arabs. Other scholars suggest that they have non-Muslim Nilotic roots, that is from the River Nile region.\n\nThey were a minority, but became the ruling class of Darfur and Wadai in the 13th century by peacefully taking over power from the Daju. In 16th century, they were overthrown by an Arab group that founded the Keira dynasty, and later merged with the Fur people. According to the local legends of the Fur people, Shau Dorshid, the last ruler of the Tunjur, was “driven out by his own people because he compelled his subjects to dig wells in the high rocky regions and to undertake the ardeous and useless task of levelling the Mail mountain peak, on the summit of which he wanted to establish his residence\" His capital is said to have been the site of Ain Farah.\n\nAbout the middle of the 17th century, the Tunjur people were expelled from the Islamic Wadai empire by Abd-el-Kerim of the Maba people, and the Mabas controlled the slave supply caravans to the north. The Tunjur people then migrated west into their current location. Thereafter, they converted to Maliki fiqh of Sunni Islam.\n\nThey are farmers and live closely associated with the Fur. Their own Tunjur language is now extinct, and they now speak Arabic, Fur or Beri language as their first language.\n\nLike the Fur and the Zaghawa, since the start of the Darfur conflict in February 2003, many Tunjur have been affected.

America's densest concentration of cultural attractions and performing arts venues, it includes such world-class institutions as the Cleveland Museum of Art; Severance Hall, home to the Cleveland Orchestra; the Cleveland Institute of Art; Case Western Reserve University; the Cleveland Institute of Music; the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland; the Cleveland Botanical Garden; historic Lake View Cemetery; the Cleveland Museum of Natural History; and University Hospitals/Case Medical Center. The area is also known as \"The Circle\" to locals. Encompassing approximately the University neighborhood is bordered to the north by the Glenville neighborhood, to the south by the Buckeye-Shaker neighborhood, to the west and southwest by the neighborhoods of Hough and Fairfax (also known as Midtown) and to the east by the cities of East Cleveland and Cleveland Heights. University Circle is member of the Global Cultural Districts Network.\n\nWhile the population of University Circle ranks on the lower end of Cleveland's 36 defined Statistical Planning Areas (SPAs), it ranks near the top in importance to the city's economic sector. Neighborhood businesses and institutions provide the city with more than 30,000 jobs in a variety of fields, including averaging 1,000 new jobs per year since 2005. Nearby attractions draw approximately 2.5 million visitors annually. As the neighborhood's name implies, higher learning is a major part of the culture of University Circle, with over 13,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students attending the area's various institutions. University Circle Inc., a not-for-profit corporation established in 1957, serves as the neighborhood chamber of commerce, providing many administrative and quasi-governmental functions for the area, including security, transportation administration, and marketing. University Circle has its own full-service police department to provide security and patrol the area.\n\nForbes ranked University as one of America's Prettiest Neighborhoods; with high praise for its symphony orchestra, museums, botanical garden, planetarium, high-end foods, world class culture, and walkability. In a 2007 \"USA Today\" article entitled \"10 great places to discover Italy in America\", Mario Batali was quoted as saying, \"Corbo's Bakery has the best cassata (cake) I have tried in the USA.\" The article listed Cleveland's Little Italy as a top ten Little Italy in America. Askmen.com ranked Cleveland's Little Italy #3 out of 10 in their list of \"Top 10: Little Italies\".\n\nPoints of interest in the University Circle neighborhood include:\n\n\nUniversity Circle was known during the early 19th century as Doan’s Corners, after Nathanial Doan, a member of the Connecticut Land Company, who settled his family and started a community here.\n\nThe name \"University Circle\" began to take shape in the 1880s. Western Reserve University moved its campus from Hudson, Ohio, to Euclid Avenue in 1883. Case School of Applied Science moved from Downtown Cleveland to a site next to WRU in 1885. Their relocation led to the birth of an educational center and the creation of a new community called University Circle, named in part after these new institutions—but also the circular street intersection and trolley turnaround located at Euclid Avenue and Doan Brook Boulevard (Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard today).\n\nBy the 1890s, the Western Reserve School of Design for Women (Cleveland Institute of Art) moved to University Circle, and the concept of developing a world-class arts and cultural center came to life. The concept became more concrete when Jeptha Wade, a trustee of Western Reserve University, set aside land for the Cleveland Museum of Art to be built in the Circle. The Historical Society (Western Reserve Historical Society) joined these institutions before the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe Circle began to grow rapidly in the early 20th century. The Cleveland Museum of Art opened its doors in 1916. By the 1920s and 1930s, 19 educational and cultural institutions were located in the area, from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to the Cleveland Hearing and Speech Center to the Cleveland Botanical Garden and others.\n\nCleveland's college football scene began in University Circle through both Case and Western Reserve football teams. Van Horn Field hosted games against Ohio State, Notre Dame, and Alabama. Famed Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne made his coaching debut against Case in University Circle in 1918. In 1920, The Alabama Crimson Tide played their first ever game in the north at Van Horn Field against Case. \n\nThe arrival of University Hospitals in 1931 (founded in 1866) led to health care becoming another center of innovation in University Circle. Less than away from University Hospitals, the Cleveland Clinic had been serving its patients since 1921. Also in 1931 Severance Hall, home of the Cleveland Orchestra, was constructed at the corner of Euclid and East Boulevard. By 1950, 34 institutions had chosen University Circle as their home. In 1967, Case School of Applied Science and Western Reserve University confederated to become Case Western Reserve University.\n\nUniversity Circle remains Cleveland's center for cultural, educational, religious, and social-service institutions. The area is currently undergoing many construction projects with many institutions expanding, and private development of residential and commercial dwellings. New housing developments in the area have increased the number of year-round residents in the area to an estimated 15,000 as of 2013.\n\nIn 2012, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MoCA) opened its new permanent location in University Circle at the corner of Mayfield Road and Euclid Avenue.\n\nUniversity Circle is served by multiple forms of transportation, including rapid train, bus, bus rapid transit (BRT), and circulators. Unique from other Cleveland neighborhoods, it contains two train stops on the RTA's Red Line, the Little Italy-University Circle Station and the University Circle-Cedar Rapid Station. The CircleLink shuttle service (colloquially known as the \"Greenie\") provides free public transportation within University Circle. It provides service between the north and south sides of the CWRU campus, from University Circle to Coventry Village, around the CWRU campus and the University Hospitals of Cleveland, and between the Urban Child Research Center and the main Case campus. The new BRT HealthLine, which opened on October 24, 2008, is the newest option to the neighborhood, being a major destination on the line along Euclid Avenue that connects Public Square to Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. In a $197 million project, Euclid Avenue was rebuilt during construction, with the installation of public art, new lighting, and sidewalks along the entire length of the HealthLine, along with dedicated bus lanes. There are seven HealthLine stops in University Circle and runs 24 hours. Additionally, many bus routes have stops in University Circle, including bus numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 32, 38, and 48/48A.\n\nUniversity Circle is known for its year-round cultural events:\n\nUniversity Circle is undergoing $2 billion in construction and renovation projects.\n\nThe Uptown project is a multi-phase, $150 million-plus retail, entertainment, restaurant and cultural project under development by MRN Ltd. of Cleveland, and sponsored by Case Western Reserve University and University Circle Inc. Its location creates a true center to University Circle.\n\nA $44.5 million \"Phase I\" broke ground on August 2, 2010, creating two mixed-use buildings of 102 apartments above first floor retail.\n\nAdditional anchors of the project currently under construction include the $66 million expansion of the Cleveland Institute of Art and the $32 million new home for the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA). The new MOCA is designed by the London architect Farshid Moussavi. The surrounding pedestrian plaza is designed by James Corner Field Operations, the same landscape architecture firm who designed the High Line in New York City.\n\nThe $21 million \"Phase II\" consists of 43 apartments, dormitories for the Cleveland Institute of Art, and retail. The anchor tenant is a two-story bowling alley, known as Corner Alley. Completion date was in fall 2014. Euclid–East 120th (RTA Rapid Transit station) has been relocated to Mayfield Road at East 119th Street. With a total cost of $17.5 million, it was renamed the Little Italy-University Circle Rapid Station.\n\nOn November 30, 2011, the \"New York Times\" showcased the project with an article entitled \"Cleveland Turns Uptown Into New Downtown\".\n\nOn March 7, 2005 the Cleveland Museum of Art embarked on a multi-year project to renovate and expand into the next century. The project is designed by architect Rafael Viñoly, combining old and new styles. At a total cost of $350 million, it is the largest cultural project in the history of the state of Ohio and one of the most comprehensive renovation and expansion projects in the museum field in the nation.\n\nThree new facilities and structures opened in summer of 2011. They include the $250 million , $41 million Center for Emergency Medicine, and a $30 million new parking structure.\n\nBoth current University Circle train stations were rehabbed and reconstructed by August 2015.\n\nThe University Circle-Cedar Rd rapid station underwent a complete rehab, using an ADA-compliant design to include a new rail entry plaza, waiting area, and train loading platform. A new bus terminal was also constructed on the north side of Cedar Road with a pedestrian connection between the bus terminal and the rail station. Secured funding included a $10.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation and a $2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration—totaling $12.5 million in federal funds.\n\nThe Euclid–East 120th rapid station was relocated in conjunction with the Uptown Project to E.119 St and Mayfield Rd. Funding was received through a $12.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, via the Federal Transit Administration. The final cost of the new station was around $17.5 million.\n\nTotaling a $526 million expansion, this project includes a seven-story administrative office tower, living space for 122 homeless veterans, a 2,000-car parking garage, and a seven-story tower with 222 patient beds. Among the other parts of the project are the renovation of the hematology/oncology unit, expansion of the radiation area, building two floors on top of the atrium to accommodate various services, and an expanded operating room.\n\nTwo major new construction projects are readying to break ground:\n\nIn Spring 2012, Case Western Reserve University campus will undergo the construction of $50 million student center in the center of campus. It will be known as the Tinkham Veale Student Center designed by Ralph Johnson of Perkins + Will. It will encompass 82,000-square-feet, have 24/7 student access, and be environmentally friendly—with a green roof to absorb rainwater and windows designed to prevent excessive heat from sunlight. The second project will be known as the Wyant Field House, enclosing the last open portion of DiSanto Field. The Wyant Field House will be approximately 24,000 square feet and will serve as a facility for varsity athletes and the 2,500 students who reside at The Village. The facility will include weight training and cardiovascular areas, a Varsity Club lounge, and multipurpose space.\n\nLittle Italy (known locally as \"Murray Hill\" or \"The Hill\") is an ethnic enclave that serves as the historic center of Cleveland's Italian American community. It is located from E. 119th to E. 125th streets on Murray Hill and Mayfield roads, situated at the eastern city limits, along a long, moderately sloping grade that ascends in elevation approximately 300 feet. It is bounded to the east and south by suburban Cleveland Heights, to the northeast by Lakeview Cemetery, and to the west by CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority Red Line railroad tracks, which separates it from the rest of University Circle.\n\nLittle Italy is known for its several culinary, historic, and cultural sites. Its biggest attractions are the restaurants, bakeries, and pizzerias. It is also home to a thriving art gallery scene and many boutique shops. The best known historic structure is Holy Rosary Church built in 1908. Culturally, the Alta House is the community center for the neighborhood founded in 1895. The private elementary and middle school is Montessori Elementary at Holy Rosary Church. Tony Brush Park provides the neighborhoods green space and playgrounds.\n\nEach August, the Roman Catholic congregation of the historic Holy Rosary Church celebrates the 4-day festival for the Feast of the Assumption, in which Little Italy stages Greater Cleveland's largest Italian-American street festival. Every October, Little Italy hosts the city's Columbus Day Parade. The neighborhood enjoys artwalks a few times a year, usually in June, October, and December.\n\nLittle Italy began in 1895 when immigrant Joseph Carabelli saw the need for monument work in Cleveland's Lakeview Cemetery and established what soon became the city's leading marble and granite works. Local Cleveland industrial billionaire John D. Rockefeller took a special liking to the Italian immigrants of the neighborhood and commissioned the building of the community center Alta House, named after his daughter Alta Rockefeller Prentice, in 1900. Little Italy is also home to the first Italian restaurant to open in the State of Ohio, Guarino's. The first hand-crank pasta machine was invented in Little Italy by Angelo Vitantonio, an Italian immigrant to Cleveland. He received a patent for the product in 1906, and went on to found the Italian kitchenware manufacturer VillaWare, which continues to operate today. In 1911 it was estimated that 96% of the inhabitants were Italian-born, and another 2% were of Italian parents. Ettore Boiardi (Chef Boyardee) opened his first restaurant, Il Giardino d'Italia, in the 1920s. In 1993, the community dedicated Tony Brush Park, named for champion boxer and Little Italy resident Anthony Brescia, at Mayfield and Random roads. Major residential project expansions occurred in 2003 with the 20-unit Villa Carabelli, in 2005 with the 15-unit Random Road Lofts townhomes, and in 2011 the 27-unit 27 Coltman townhouses. The neighborhood bocci courts are located at the Alta House, and in 2011 underwent a complete remodeling in a $110,000 project, being named in honor of Nick and Dorothy Lucarelli.\n\nFor a large part of its history, Cleveland was home to the largest Mafia organization between New York and Chicago. The Mayfield Road Mob was the name of a gang which began around 1920 in Little Italy. Among the members of the \"Mayfield Road Mob\" were James T. Licavoli and Jimmy Fratianno. This Mafia faction was even mentioned by its old name in the movie \"The Godfather\" as the Lakeview Road Gang, as Lakeview Cemetery borders Mayfield Road Hill.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42236542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42236542", "title": "Women's rights in Nepal", "text": "Women's rights in Nepal\n\nNepal, a Himalayan country situated in South Asia, is one of the poorest countries of the world. It has suffered from political instability and undemocratic rule for much of its history. There is a lack of access to basic services, people have superstitious beliefs, and there is gender discrimination. Although the Constitution provides protections for women, including equal pay for equal work, the Government has not taken significant action to implement its provisions. \n\nThe status of women in Nepal remains very poor in terms of health, education, income, decision-making, and access to policymaking. Patriarchal practices, which control women's lives, are reinforced by the legal system. Women face systematic discrimination, particularly in rural areas. Literacy rates are substantially lower than men's, and women work longer hours. Violence against women is still common, and there are not enough women in professions. Women’s representation has been ensured in constituent assembly, but women’s equal participation in all state mechanisms is far from ideal.\n\nLiteracy rates in Nepal still remain low, at 52.74% (CBS, 2001). Despite improvement in recent years, the disparity in literacy rates between men and women still remains. In 2001, the rate of literacy for females stood at 42.49%. The low rate of literacy for women can be attributed to the discrimination they face at home.\n\nFemales face gender-based violence and this greatly limits their ability to attend school or receive proper education. Furthermore, religion restricts the opportunities for women to receive education. For example, the majority of the female Muslim population in Nepal is still deprived of basic education, with only 20% having had any level of education.\n\nThe percentage of women from rural areas who have never attended school: 51.1% (CBS, 2008) as compared to the percentage of women from urban areas who have never attended school is 25% (CBS, 2008). This is reflected in the disparity in literacy rates, between women in rural areas, 36.5%, and those in urban areas, 61.5%. Literacy rates in rural areas are almost half that in urban areas. Although overall female participation in the workforce has increased, the majority of employed women are still heavily concentrated in the low-wage and more labor-intensive industries. Formal sector female participation is 6%. According to the 2008 report from CBS, there were 155 000 male professionals, but only 48 000 female professionals, about 31% of female professionals. This is in stark contrast to female participation in the subsistence agricultural sector, with female participation almost 160% that of male participation.\n\nHealth services in Nepal are inadequate and insufficient and are thus reflected in the low health status of Nepalese in relation to the rest of the Southeast Asian region.\nThe most common illnesses that females at reproductive age face are anaemia and malnutrition, due to the discrimination faced in childhood and in growing up. As females, especially girls, are considered to be of the lowest status in the household, they are often the last to eat and thus do not receive the proper nutrition required. Almost 70% of females who have reached puberty suffer from these common illnesses. Also, many women often delay seeking medical help out of fear.\n\nThe maternity mortality ratio in Nepal, stands at 380 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2008, according to estimates by the WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA/The World Bank.Although there has been a significant decrease as compared to the ratio of 539 per 100 000 live births in 2003, the ratio is still one of the highest in the world.\nBecause of the inadequate provision of healthcare for pregnant mothers, they are more susceptible to death during the course of pregnancy and during labor itself. \nAccording to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2001, about 10% of all births are carried out in the presence of a qualified doctor or medical staff. This reflects the prevalence of home births, around 81% of all births, in Nepalese society. Due to the cultural beliefs, women are generally reluctant to allow any outsiders to be present or attend to the birth. Geography has also greatly limited the availability of health services especially those in rural and mountainous regions.Even though there has been much road development in recent years, females are less impacted by it, as they remain infrequent road users.\n\nGender-based violence (GBV) towards women is a severe issue in Nepal where its women often find themselves susceptible to both public and domestic violence which constitutes rape, sexual abuse in the workplace and at home, and human trafficking. There is a persistence of harmful traditional practices deemed life-threatening such as Deuki (act of offering young girls to Hindu temples to live without proper care or education) and Chhaupadi (menstruating women are kept in a shed away from the home to live under harsh conditions). Based on the study by United Nations Population Fund’s (UNFPA) entitled Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women in Nepal, abused women are more inclined to suffer from depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and various reproductive health problems.\n\nIn the recently published Nepal Human Rights Yearbook 2012 by Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a study of all 75 districts across the country returned results of 648 women as victims of violence in 2011. In addition, the number of girls under the age of 18 who were affected stands at 379.\n\nThe proportion of Nepali women who have been subjected to domestic violence are estimated at 60 to 70 per cent. Gender-based violence is worse in rural communities where an estimated 81 per cent of women experience recurring domestic violence.These incidences include physical abuse by husbands, polygamy, dowry-related murders, and physical and psychological harassment by household members.\n\nReasons for gender-based violence in Nepal are largely attributed to social taboos and superstitions associated with women and deeply entrenched beliefs that propagate derogatory attitudes toward female such as Chhori ko janma hare ko karma (\"A daughter is born with a doomed fate\").Likewise, results derived from INSEC’s monitoring of the situation indicated that subjugating women to domestic violence was considered a deep-rooted traditional practice.Survey results also show that 20 and 23 per cent of men and women in Nepal view domestic violence as being acceptable.\n\nDespite efforts of various human rights and women’s rights NGOs, together with international aid agencies, to lobby for the elimination of domestic violence through implementation of more effective measures, the \"Domestic Violence (Crime and Punishment)\" bill introduced in 2002 is at a standstill.Complaints by women’s rights activists are directed towards the lackadaisical efforts of the law enforcement agencies in which disputes are settled without any charges pressed against the perpetrators. This is reflected in a statement by activist and former National Women Commission (NWC) chairperson Bandana Rana, \"Often, police and local people try to settle the domestic dispute by pressing the women into accepting their ‘fate’ as the society is still dominated by Hindu patriarchy with its own set of strict codes—many of which are in conflict with basic rights for women\".\n\n"}
