{"id": "9057483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9057483", "title": "Abstinence in Judaism", "text": "Abstinence in Judaism\n\nAbstinence is the refraining from enjoyments which are lawful in themselves. Abstinence in general can be considered a virtue only when it serves the purpose of consecrating a life to a higher purpose. The saints, or adherents of religious and philosophical systems that teach the mortification of the flesh, practice asceticism only with the view of perfecting the soul for the higher state of bliss for which they believe it to be destined.\n\nThe Jewish religion, having for its fundamental ethical principle the law of holiness: \"Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy\" (Lev. xix. 2), accentuates the perfectibility of the whole man, while demanding the sanctification of all that pertains to human existence. \"The Lord did not create the world for desolation; he formed it for human habitation\" (Isa. xlv. 18) is the principle emphasized by the rabbis (Pes. 88b). In the ideal state of things nothing should be profane. \"In that day there shall be [inscribed] upon the bells of the horses: Holiness unto the Lord! And the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar\" (Zech. xiv. 20, 21). This view is expressed in no uncertain terms by Rab in Yer. Kid. iv., at the end: \"Man in the life to come will have to account for every enjoyment offered him that was refused without sufficient cause.\"\n\nAccordingly, we find asceticism, or abstinence as a principle, condemned in the Talmud. \"Why must the Nazarite bring a sin-offering at the end of his term? (Num. vi. 13, 14). Because he sinned against his own person by his vow of abstaining from wine,\" says Eliezer ha-Kappar (Sifra, ad loc., and Ned. 10a), drawing his conclusion from this Biblical passage: \"Whosoever undergoes fasting and other penances for no special reason commits a wrong.\" \"Is the number of things forbidden by the Law not enough that you venture to add of your own accord by your inconsiderate vow?\" says R. Isaac (Yer. Ned. ix. 41b). See Maimonides, \"Yad ha-chazakah\", De'ot, iii. 1, where the monastic principle of abstinence, whether in regard to marriage or to eating of meat and drinking of wine, or to any other personal comfort, is most emphatically condemned as antagonistic to the spirit of Judaism.\n\nStill abstinence is frequently considered meritorious, if not actually necessary, as a means of self-discipline. Simon the Just said: \"I partook of a Nazarite meal only once, when I met with a handsome youth from the South who had taken the vow. When I asked him the reason, he said: 'I saw the Evil Spirit pursue me as I beheld my face reflected in the water, and I swore that these long curls shall be cut off and offered as a sacrifice to the Lord.' Whereupon I kissed him upon his forehead and blessed him, saying: 'May there be many Nazarites like thee in Israel!'\" (Nazir, 4b). In this sense abstinence is supposed to have a positive value, as a training in self-control. Consequently, the law: \"Be holy!\" was interpreted: Exercise abstinence in order to arrive at the state of purity and holiness (Ab. Zarah, 20b; Sifra, Kedoshim, beginning). \n\nExcessive indulgence in wine or in any form of enjoyment being harmful (Prov. xxiii. 20), man must learn self-restraint in due time. \"Haste!\" people say to the Nazarite. \"Pass quickly around the vineyard, come not too near the grape\" (B. M. 92a) became the proverbial warning. \"Make a fence around the Law\" (Ab. i. 1; Ab. R. N. ii.). \"Abstain from everything evil and from whatsoever is like unto it,\" a rule found alike in the \"Didache\", iii. 1, and in the Talmud (Hul. 44b)—a saying based on Book of Job, xxxi. 1. \"Abstain from lusts of the flesh and the world\" (\"Didache,\" i. 4). All the Mosaic laws concerning diet are declared by Rav to have for their purpose the purification of Israel (Lev. R. 13)—to train the Jew in self-discipline.\n\nAccordingly, there were those that taught and practised abstinence for the purpose of self-consecration. Such were the followers of the Rechabites (Jer. xxxv. 2) among the Essenes, \"the water-drinkers\" (Mek., Yithro, Amalek 2). A revival of their principles was attempted in Persia by Abu Isa al-Ispahani in the 8th century, who added to the prohibition of wine also that of meat. With this may be compared the vegetarianism of the modern sect of Hasidim. The tendency to mysticism induced moral philosophers of the Middle Ages like Bahya ibn Paquda to favor abstinence as a mode of moral self-elevation (see \"Chobot ha-Lebabot,\" ix. 5, xi. 6).\n\nThe Biblical narrative, however, according to which man, in the golden age of innocence (Gen. i. 29), abstained from eating the flesh of animals, while after the flood, in an age of decline, the eating of meat, with the exception of the blood, was permitted (Gen. ix. 2 et seq.), is in striking accord with Greek or Aryan tradition (Plato, \"De Legibus,\" vi. 782; Plutarch, \"Symposion,\" viii. 83; Porphyrius, \"De Abstinentia,\" iii. 25, 26; Diogenes Laertius, viii. 20; Spiegel, \"Eranische Alterthümer,\" i. 455).\n\nAs a rule, however, Jewish opinion has been against total abstinence, and is best represented by Maimonides, who advocates the \"golden middle way\" of moderation (\"Yad ha-Chazakah\", Hilkot De'ot, i.-iii.).\n\n"}
{"id": "291441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=291441", "title": "Anglo", "text": "Anglo\n\nAnglo is a prefix indicating a relation to the Angles, England, the English people or the English language, such as in the term \"Anglo-Saxon language\". It is often used alone, somewhat loosely, to refer to people of British Isles descent in the Americas, New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. It is also used, both in English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries, to refer to Anglophone people of other European origins.\n\nAnglo is a Late Latin prefix used to denote \"English-\" in conjunction with another toponym or demonym. The word is derived from Anglia, the Latin name for England and still used in the modern name for its eastern region, East Anglia. Anglia and England both mean \"land of the Angles\", a Germanic people originating in the north German peninsula of Angeln, that is, the region of today's Lower Saxony that joins the Jutland Peninsula and thus forms an angle, so the Romans named it \"Angulus\".\n\nIt is also often used incorrectly to refer to \"British\" in historical and other contexts after the Acts of Union 1707, for example such as in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, where in later years agreement was between the British government and the Dutch, not an English government. Typical examples of this use are also shown below, where non-English people from the British Isles are described as being \"Anglo\".\n\n\"Anglo\" is not an easily defined term. For traditionalists, there are linguistic problems with using the word as an adjective or noun on its own. For example, the purpose of the \"-o\" ending is to enable the formation of a compound term (for example \"Anglo-Saxon\" meaning of Angle and Saxon origin), so there is only an apparent parallelism between, for example, Latino and Anglo. However, a semantic change has taken place in many English-speaking regions so that in informal usage the meanings listed below are common. The definition is changed in each region which defines how it is identified.\n\nThe term \"Anglo-African\" has been used historically to self-identify by people of mixed British and African ancestry born in the United States and in Africa. \"The Anglo-African\" and \"The Weekly Anglo-African\" were the names of newspapers published by African American abolitionist Robert Hamilton (1819–1870) in New York during the American Civil War era. \"The Anglo-African\" was also the name of a newspaper published in Lagos (now part of Nigeria) from 1863 to 1865. It was founded and edited by Robert Campbell (1829–1884), a Jamaican born son of a Scottish father and Mulatto mother. The term has also been used historically to describe people living in the British Empire in Africa. \"The Anglo-African Who's Who and Biographical Sketch-Book\" published in London in 1905 includes details of prominent British and Afrikaner people in Africa at that time.\n\nIn Australia, \"Anglo\" is used as part of the terms \"Anglo-Australian\" and \"Anglo-Celtic\", which refer to the majority of Australians, who are of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish descent.\n\nIn Canada, and especially in Canadian French, the terms \"Anglophone\", \"Anglo-Canadian\" or simply \"Anglo\", are widely used to designate someone whose mother tongue is English, as opposed to \"Francophone\", which describes someone whose mother tongue is French, and to \"Allophone\", which describes someone whose mother tongue is a language other than English or French. (In Quebec, the word \"Anglophone\" or \"Anglo\" refers to English-speaking Quebecers in both English and French.) \"Anglo-Metis\" is also sometimes used to refer to a historical ethnic group.\n\nImmigrants from English-speaking countries are sometimes referred to as \"Anglos\".\n\nIn Scotland the term \"Anglo-Scot\", often shortened to \"Anglos\", is used to refer to people with mixed Scottish-English ancestry, or people with English ancestry born in Scotland.\n\nThe term Anglo-Scot is more often used to describe Scottish sports players who are based in England or playing for English teams, or vice versa. This usage is especially used in football and notably in rugby union, where the Anglo Scots were a Scottish non-native select provincial District side that competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship.\n\nIn many parts of the United States, especially those with high Hispanic populations, \"Anglo-American\" is shortened to \"Anglo\" and applied to white Americans who are not of Hispanic or Latino origin and sometimes to those who are not of French origin, but the latter criterion is based on specific linguistic considerations and limited to Louisiana and parts of Texas.\n\nIf language is taken into consideration the term \"Anglo-American\" also excludes Franco-Americans such as the Cajuns of Louisiana, but would include them when language is excluded as a criterion.\n\nIn the Southwest United States, \"Anglo\", short for \"Anglo American\", is used as a synonym for non-Hispanic Whites; that is European Americans (except people who speak Latin languages), most of whom speak the English language, even those who are not necessarily of English or British descent. Some non-Hispanic whites in the United States who speak English but are not of English or British ancestry do not identify with the term \"Anglo\" and find the term offensive. For instance, some Cajuns in south Louisiana use the term to refer to area whites who do not have Francophone backgrounds. Irish Americans, the second largest self-identified ethnic group in the United States following German-Americans, also sometimes take umbrage at being called \"Anglo\".\n\n"}

{"id": "8574786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8574786", "title": "Capital punishment in Malaysia", "text": "Capital punishment in Malaysia\n\nCapital punishment is a legal penalty in Malaysia. It is a mandatory punishment for murder, drug trafficking, treason, and waging war against Yang di-Pertuan Agong (the King). Recently, the law was extended to include acts of terrorism. Any terrorists, and anyone who aids terrorists, financially or otherwise, is liable to face the death penalty. Since January 2003, the death penalty in Malaysia has been a mandatory punishment for rapists that cause death and child rapists. A 1961 law states that kidnapping carried a life sentence or a death sentence, preceded by a whipping. \n\nIn October 2018, the Malaysian government announced that it would be tabling a bill to abolish the death penalty in Malaysia. In addition, the Government has also imposed a moratorium on all executions until the death penalty is abolished.\n\nThe idea behind capital punishment in Malaysia arose from a mix between the common law system that Malaysia inherited during their colonisation period from the British and the authorisation of certain punishments from Islam. Currently, death penalties are carried out in Malaysia through hanging and the penalty is used for a variety of offences.\n\nIn 2016 Malaysia carried out nine executions, imposed 36 death sentences, and two death sentences were commuted. Malaysia was also reported to have 1,042 death row inmates, including 413 foreign nationals. \n\nOn 10 October 2018, Liew Vui Keong, the minister in charge of law in the Prime Minister's Department, announced that the Malaysian Government would abolish the death penalty. A proposed bill is expected to be tabled at the next sitting of Parliament. The minister also announced that the Government had imposed a moratorium on all executions until the passage of the new law. The current Pakatan Harapan government had campaigned on reviewing capital punishment and other \"unsuitable\" national security laws during the 2018 Malaysian general election. The Government's announcement to abolish capital punishment was welcomed by Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International's Secretary General, who called on the Malaysian Parliament to consign the death penalty to the history books.\n\nThe following is a list of the criminal offences that carry the death penalty:\n\nOnly High Courts had jurisdiction in capital cases. Appeals to the Court of Appeal and the Federal Court are automatic. The last resort for the convicted is to plead pardon for clemency. Pardons or clemency were granted by the Ruler or Yang di-Pertua Negeri (Governor) of the state where the crime was committed or the Yang di-Pertuan Agong if the crime was committed in the Federal Territories or when involving members of the armed forces. Death sentences were carried out by hanging as provided in Section 277 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nPregnant women and minors may not be sentenced to death. In lieu of the death penalty, women pregnant at the time of sentencing would have their sentences reduced to life imprisonment as provided by Section 275 of the Criminal Procedure Code, while juvenile offenders would be detained at the pleasure of the Ruler, Governor or Yang di-Pertuan Agong depending on where the crime was committed as provided by the Child Act 2001.\n\nThe death penalty for drug trafficking was made mandatory in 1983. The main reason for this was because drug trafficking was seen as one of the national challenges of the country. Since then, there has been a relaxation on this rule as death penalties may sometimes be substituted with a lighter sentence which includes mandatory whippings, forced rehabilitation or preventive detention. \n\nThe presumption is that a person would be considered to be trafficking drugs if they were in possession of a certain amount of dangerous drugs. Under section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act, those in possession of 15 g or more heroin and morphine; 1,000 g or more opium (raw or prepared); 200 g or more cannabis; and 40 g or more cocaine will receive the mandatory death sentence. The courts have affirmed that to establish prima facie drug trafficking, it has to be shown that the accused party was in actual possession of the drug and that the person has to have knowledge that they were in possession of the dangerous drug. Once the death sentence has been passed, the sentence shall be passed on to the chief minister of the state where the judgment was given where a note about the evidence used in the case and a report about the judges opinion of the sentence would be included. The minister then has a choice of either fixing a time and place for the execution to be carried out or may substitute in a lesser punishment if the minister wishes.\n\nThe courts though have noted the severity of the sentence and in several instances have tried to impose a lower sentence where possible. One of the methods employed by the court would be to ensure that the procedures set out for the sentence have been strictly adhered to by the prosecution. The court in that case paid close attention to the evidence presented to ensure that the judgment made was the right one. The court has also acquitted a person when the reported amount of drugs seized was only slightly different from the amount of drugs received by the forensics lab chemist. The difference in amount was 10.21 grams.\n\nThere have also been suggestions by those in the executive for a re-appeal of the death sentence for drug trafficking. The Law Minister in 2012 held that the government may replace the death sentence with an imprisonment term instead in recognition that such a sentence only punishes the drug mules and not those higher up in the chain. There was also the fact that the death penalty does not seem to have the deterring effect that such a penalty was hoped to create, thus questioning the need for the penalty for that particular offence.\n\nThe abolition of the death penalty has started to gain momentum in Malaysia. The government has started to consider more humane ways to \"uphold the justice for the people.\" The public are not as unsupportive for the abolishment of the death penalty as imagined. It was found that although a substantive portion of the public would agree for the death penalty in cases of murder, drug trafficking or firearms offences, this number took a considerable drop once the participants were told about the various scenarios which merited capital punishment as defined in the relevant statute.\n\nMalaysia has been reviewed twice by the United Nations Human Rights Council under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). First in 2009 and the other in 2013. In 2009, Malaysia reported in their national report that the death sentence was only imposed on the most serious crimes and was in line with Article 6 of the ICCPR. They also held that there were several safeguards in place in the legal system that have to be met before a death penalty can be passed.\nOf the various non-governmental organisations that made a submission for the review, three had an extract about the death penalty. The first was the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM). In their report, they noted that they were against the death penalty and natural life sentences and recommended that such cases be reviewed by the Pardon Board. Amnesty International reported that although such a heavy punishment was being carried out, very little information about execution itself was actually made public. This included when the punished was set to be carried out, the person being punished and who had been executed.\n\nIt appeared in the same report that according to 'Malaysians Against Death Penalty' there were a total of 300 inmates on death row in prison on January 2008. Most of them were for drug related offences. The Coalition of Malaysian NGOs in the UPR Process stated that they took the same stance as Amnesty International and noted that the death penalty went against the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\nAs for the Working Groups report, several nations including France, Djibouti, Egypt and Sudan recommended for a range of actions to be taken against the death penalty. This included suggestions of outright abolition to ratifying the ICCPR and applying the relevant standards when the death penalty was imposed. Malaysia re-affirmed their position on the matter and stated that the death penalty was only applied in the most severe cases. However, they noted that they were at the time attempting to remove the death penalty and caning of those below the age of 18 through an amendment of the Essential (Security Cases) Regulations 1975 and at the same time, would consider a reduction in offences which carry the death penalty in a step towards the abolition of the death penalty outright.\n\nIn its national report, Malaysia re-iterated its statement made in the 2009 Periodic Review. They added though that there has recently been discussion with the public about the possibility of abolishment of the death penalty. They also noted that a study has been undertaken to reform the criminal justice in which included offences with a death penalty upon conviction.\nAmnesty International prepared another report for submission for the 2013 Universal Periodic Review. With regards about their submission to the death penalty in 2009, the organisation reported that none of the past recommendations have been implemented yet and reported that currently, there were a total of 930 inmates on death row. The Child Rights Information Network reported that the death penalty was still in force in Malaysia which allowed for the death penalty sentence to be passed under Article 97 of the Child Act 2001. The report submitted Joint Submission number 8 reported that convictions under s302 of the Penal code for murder still occurs in Malaysia.\n\nThe report noted that Malaysia's approach to drug offences violated international standards. They further noted that there was a serious lack of due process given that those accused of drug trafficking are presumed guilty upon arrest. The organisation argued that as a result of these presumptions, it has led to hundreds of death sentences and executions. They next reported that for treason which was punishable by death, at least 4 people were executed because of it in 2007.\nIn the working group's report, several nations commented on the fact that Malaysia still has the death penalty and suggested that the death penalty be abolished or that a moratorium on the death penalty be recognised. Some of the nations that recommended this included Spain, Switzerland, Argentina, Belgium, Costa Rica and Kazakhstan. Malaysia responded with a statement that they would keep their options open and continue to engage the public on this subject. They would also look into alternatives to the death penalty. Malaysia pledged that it would complete its review on the moratorium of the death penalty with the intent to abolish it at a later date.\n\n\n"}

His father had died in 1835, leaving him and each of his seven siblings a substantial inheritance. Charles married Caroline \"Cara\" Hennell (4 June 1814 – 21 February 1905) on 26 May 1836 at Hackney, Middlesex, England. A disciple of the social reformer Robert Owen (1771–1858), he used the wealth generated from his businesses to establish nonsectarian public schools and to try to bring about changes in society.\n\nBray was a freethinker in religious matters and a progressive in politics. He was also a disciple of the phrenologist George Combe (1788–1858).\n\nThe Brays' home \"Rosehill\" (in Coventry, Warwickshire) was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. People who participated in the \"Rosehill Circle\" included (among many others) social reformer Robert Owen, philosopher/sociologist Herbert Spencer, Harriet Martineau, and transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson. Most of the people who participated in the Rosehill Circle tended to have theologies that were considerably more liberal than the average (for example, many participants cast doubt on the supernatural elements of Bible stories).\n\nThe core group of the Rosehill Circle consisted of Charles Bray, his wife Caroline, and some of the members of Caroline's immediate family along with several of their close friends. The core group members from Caroline's immediate family were her sisters Mary Hennell (23 May 1802 – 16 May 1843) and Sara Hennell (1812–1899), and her brother Charles Christian Hennell (1809–1850). Charles Hennell was a writer on theological and philosophical topics whose most important work was \"An Inquiry Concerning the Origin of Christianity\" (London, 1838). Although Caroline's father James Hennell (8 October 1782 – 30 January 1816) was a devout Unitarian who raised his children as Unitarians, his 3 children who were core members of the Rosehill Circle all entertained serious reservations about many Unitarian beliefs.\nOn 1 November 1843 Charles C. Hennell married Elizabeth Rebecca \"Rufa\" Brabant (28 September 1811 – 1 March 1898), another core member of the Rosehill Circle. Elizabeth's father, physician Robert Herbert Brabant (14 November 1781 – 13 May 1866), was a core member as well. Elizabeth, in the months immediately preceding her engagement and marriage to Charles Hennell, had been under commission (by a private group associated with the Rosehill Circle) to translate into English the great theological treatise \"Das Leben Jesu, kritisch bearbeitet\" by David Friedrich Strauss (1808–1874). As soon as it had been first published (in Tübingen, Germany – vol. 1 in 1835, and vol. 2 in 1836), Strauss' \"Das Leben Jesu\" was recognized internationally as one of the most revolutionary and important theological treatises of the 19th century. Not surprisingly, the members of the private group which had commissioned the translation, led by the radical politician Joseph Parkes (1796–1865), were very eager to be able to read this great work in their native English. However, once it was realized that Elizabeth's marriage would mean an end to her translation work, in January 1844 it was decided that Mary Anne Evans (1819–1880) (later known as the novelist George Eliot) would take up the translating where Elizabeth had left off at the time of her marriage (which was about halfway through volume 1 of \"Das Leben Jesu\"). Mary Anne had quickly become an integral part of the Rosehill Circle after she met and befriended Charles and Caroline Hennell in November 1841. Somewhat later she became an intimate friend of Elizabeth Brabant as well (Mary Anne served as a bridesmaid at Elizabeth's wedding in 1843). Mary Anne worked on the translation of Strauss' \"Das Leben Jesu\" (fourth German edition, 2 vols., 1840) for over 2 years, and in June 1846 the fruit of her (and Elizabeth's) labor was finally published (as an anonymous translation) under the title \"The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined\" (3 vols., London: Chapman Brothers, 1846).\n\nAs a leading light in the Coventry 'intelligentsia,' Bray helped to found The Coventry Labourers & Artisans Co-operative Society Circa 1840–60, which provided gardens for working men and a co-op store. Inspired by the cottage factories in Coventry, he drew up a plan for a small community based on the same system – squares of 3–400 houses, each with their own steam engine to provide power and would be surrounded by enough land for each house to have its own allotment.\n\n\n[ Vol. 2 ( pp. 493–663 ) contains an anonymous, untitled Appendix by Mary Hennell (1802–1843). Mary's authorship of this Appendix is known because the Appendix was reprinted ( under the title \"Social Systems and Communities\" ) in a book published in 1844, and in that book the authorship of the Appendix is attributed by Charles Bray to Mary ( see the next item for a complete explanation ). ]\n\n\n[ Neither Charles Bray's nor Mary Hennell's name appears on the title page of this book, but bibliographers usually attribute the book to Mary Hennell. It is known that Charles Bray authored this book's \"Preface\" (pp. iii–iv) and \"Introduction\" (pp. v–cxiv) since Bray was the author of \"The Philosophy of Necessity\". The work by Mary Hennell ( 1802–1843 ) which had appeared as the anonymous, untitled Appendix in vol. 2 of Bray's \"The Philosophy of Necessity\" (1841) appears in this book under the title \"Social Systems and Communities\" as the second part (pp. 1–252) of the book. On p. iii of this book (in the Preface) Bray reveals that Mary Hennell was the author of the Appendix in vol. 2 of his \"The Philosophy of Necessity\". Also on p. iii of this book Bray states that Mary Hennell died of consumption in March 1843. However, other unrelated, genealogical sources exist which state that Mary Hennell died on 16 May 1843. At this time it is believed that 16 May 1843 is the correct date of Mary's death, but this has not been verified. ]\n\n"}

It can be thought of as a process and document – and therefore a mechanism – which operationalises design guidelines or standards which have been established through a masterplan process. The masterplan or design framework is the vision. It should be accompanied by a design rationale that explains the objectives, with the design code providing instructions to the appropriate degree or precision of the more detailed design work.\n\nIn this way a design code may be a tool which helps ensure that the aspirations for quality and quantity for housing developments, particularly for large-scale projects, sought by the Government and other agencies are actually realised in the final schemes.

The oath of fealty usually took place after the act of homage, when, by the symbolic act of kneeling before the lord and placing his hands between the hands of the lord, the vassal became the \"man\" of the lord. Usually, the lord also promised to provide for the vassal in some form, either through the granting of a fief or by some other manner of support. Typically, the oath took place upon a religious object such as a Bible or saint's relic, often contained within an altar, thus binding the oath-taker before God. Fealty and homage were key elements of European feudalism.\n\nFealty is distinct from other parts of the homage ceremony, and is usually used only to refer to that part of the ceremony where the vassal swore to be a good vassal to his lord.\n\nIn medieval Europe, an oath of fealty (German: Lehnseid) was a fundamental element of the feudal system in the Holy Roman Empire. It was sworn between two people, the obliged person (\"vassal\") and a person of rank (\"liege lord\"). The oath of allegiance was usually carried out as part of a traditional ceremony in which the liegeman or vassal gave his lord a pledge of loyalty and acceptance of the consequences of a breach of trust. In return the liege lord promised to protect and remain loyal to his vassal. The rights conferred on the vassal were so similar to actual possession that it was described as beneficial ownership (\"dominium utile\"), whereas the rights of the lord were referred to as direct ownership (\"dominium directum\").\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages, the investiture and oath of fealty were invariably recorded by a deed; in modern times this replaced the traditional ceremony. Where the geographical distance between the two parties was significant, the lord could name a representative before whom the oath was to be sworn.\n\nThe whole contract including the oath of fealty was part of a formal commendation ceremony that created the feudal relationship.\n\nThe term is also used by English-speakers to refer to similar oaths of allegiance in other feudal cultures, as with medieval Japan, as well as in modern political contexts.\n\n"}

It held three meetings in 1994 and 1995.\n\nIts members included Immanuel Wallerstein (chair), Calestous Juma, Evelyn Fox Keller, Jürgen Kocka, Dominique Lecourt, Valentin Y. Mudimbe, Kinhide Mushakoji, Ilya Prigogine, Peter J. Taylor, Michel-Rolph Trouillot. Six of them were drawn from the social sciences, two from the natural sciences and two from the humanities. The commission sought to produce a book length work that would identify new directions for the organization of knowledge in the next fifty years. The report was published in 1996 by Stanford University as the book, \"Open the Social Sciences\" by Immanuel Wallerstein. To foster international debate, the report has been published in numerous languages including English, French, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Czech, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Romanian, Serbocroat, Turkish, and Japanese.\n\nThe ideas in the report have stimulated debate around the world. For example, in the Indian Magazine Frontline, Sundar Sarukkai discussed its conclusions and applicability to the Indian context, which he criticizes for being cliquish and unprofessional. In 2006 Michael Burawoy, at Berkeley, offered a highly critical perspective: \"We hear nothing about how and where this new knowledge will be produced. Nor do we hear for whom this knowledge will be produced, nor for what ends. Instead we have an abstract and totalizing utopia that reflects the concerns of Western academics, perched high up in the ivory tower, seemingly unaware that the fortress beneath them – supporting them -- was under siege\". This comment was made in spite of the fact that the commission itself included academics from the Caribbean, Africa, and East Asia, as well as Europe and North America. Richard Lee suggests concrete ways that the Commission's goal of breaking down barriers between the disciplines of the social sciences might be achieved.\n\n"}
{"id": "5599681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5599681", "title": "Homosexual transsexual", "text": "Homosexual transsexual\n\nHomosexual transsexual, is a term used by various sexologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists to describe trans women who are exclusively attracted to men, and less often trans men who are attracted to women. The term has become controversial. The concept of taxonomically categorizing trans women by sexual orientation originated with Magnus Hirschfeld in 1923, and was further posited by Harry Benjamin in 1966 as a component of the Benjamin scale. The specific term \"homosexual transsexual\" was coined by Kurt Freund in 1973, and used from 1982 onward by him and others, notably Ray Blanchard, as part of a two-type taxonomy of male-to-female transsexuality. This taxonomy has subsequently evolved into, and is in the present day referred to, as Blanchard's transsexualism typology.\n\nIn the DSM III, published in 1980, transsexualism was to be diagnosed and the sexual orientation of a transsexual specified using the terms \"homosexual\", \"heterosexual\", \"asexual\", or unspecified. This convention had its origins in the taxonomic work of researchers like Hirschfeld, Benjamin, and Freund and the fact that grouping trans women by sexual orientation reveals important qualitative and statistical differences between them, and that said differences have been maintained by various researchers as indicative or suggestive of multiple, distinct etiologies. The term \"homosexual transsexual\" has since been used in publications by a variety of academics, including Benjamin, Freund, Blanchard, and Anne Lawrence, as well as J. Michael Bailey and James Cantor, among others.\n\nThe term \"homosexual transsexual\" has been criticized from a lexical standpoint by Benjamin, Bruce Bagemihl, and John Bancroft (though supported \"conceptually\" by the former two), as being confusing, as well as insensitive to the gender identities of those whom it is intended to describe. The alternatives \"androphilic\" and \"gynephilic\" have been proposed by Milton Diamond as descriptors for sexual orientation that do not make assumptions about the sex or gender identity of the person being described. Terms such as \"androphilia\" and \"gynephilia\" are sometimes used instead of, or concurrently with, \"homosexual\", \"heterosexual\", or \"non-homosexual\" in current research, such as research which has used the Modified Androphilia Scale to assess the attraction to men of a given trans woman. S. J. Whang contended in 2004 that the term \"homosexual transsexual\" is \"archaic\". Though the term \"transsexuality\" was removed as a mental disorder from the DSM-IV and was replaced with gender identity disorder as a diagnostic label, attraction to males, females, both, or neither remains specified in the DSM IV-TR.\n\nMost research of the research on homosexual transsexuality has been conducted on trans women. They are usually socioeconomically disadvantaged, born later in a series of brothers, are unlikely to display cross-gender fetishism or autogynephilia, and come out at a younger age than non-homosexual trans women. Relatively little research has been done on gender variance in assigned women and the prevalence of female-to-male gender identity disorder (GID) is less than that of male-to-female GID.\n\nThe term \"homosexual\" transsexual was defined by Kurt Freund in 1974, and is used by various sexologists and psychiatrists to describe trans women who are attracted to men, though occasionally they use it to describe trans men who are attracted to women. The concept of a taxonomy based on transsexual sexuality was first proposed by physician Magnus Hirschfeld in 1922, and codified by endocrinologist Harry Benjamin in the Benjamin Scale in 1966, which was published in the influential book \"The Transsexual Phenomenon\". Benjamin wrote that researchers of his day thought that attraction to men, as a woman was the factor that distinguished a transvestite from a transsexual. \"The transvestite - they say - is a man, feels himself to be one, is heterosexual, and merely wants to dress as a woman. The transsexual feels himself to be a woman (\"trapped in a man’s body\") and is attracted to men.\" (Benjamin 1966).\n\nHomosexuality was removed as a mental disorder from the DSM-II, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, the most widely used diagnostic manual worldwide. Ego-dystonic homosexuality was retained as a diagnosis for those who are caused distress by their sexual orientation.\n\nIn 1980 in the DSM III, a new diagnosis was introduced, that of \"302.5 Transsexualism\" under \"Other Psychosexual Disorders\". This was an attempt to provide a diagnostic category for gender identity disorders; the others included were \"302.3 Transvestism\" and \"302.8 Fetishism\". The diagnostic category, \"transsexualism\", was for gender dysphoric\nindividuals who demonstrated at least two years of continuous interest in transforming their physical and social gender status. The subtypes were 1. asexual, 2. homosexual (same anatomic sex), 3. heterosexual (other anatomic sex) and 0. unspecified.\n\nPhysician and sexologist Kurt Freund proposed two types of cross-gender identity in 1982, based on his observation that gender identity disorder is different for homosexual males and heterosexual males. Subsequently, this term appeared in the DSM-III-R, but not in the DSM IV in which gender identity disorder replaced transsexualism. Sexologists quantitatively measure sexual orientation using psychological personality test or they rely on self reports. Blanchard and Freund used the Masculine Identity in Females (MGI), and the Modified Androphilia Scale. Homosexual transsexuals averaged a Kinsey scale measurement of 5–6 or a 9.86 ± 2.37 on the Modified Androphilia Scale. S.J. Whang wrote in 2004 that homosexual transsexual appeared in the DSM III-R, and that he considered it archaic (see next section).\n\nThe concept that transsexuals with homosexual and non-homosexual sexual orientations are etiologically different has a long history in this field. However the terms used have not always been agreed on. In recent years scientists working on the topic have criticized the practice of categorizing transsexuals by sexual orientation and sex at birth. In the words of Benjamin, male-to-female transsexuals can only be homosexual if anatomy alone is considered, and the psyche of MTF transsexuals is ignored. According to him after SRS calling a male-to-female transsexual homosexual is pedantic. One must bear in mind that when Benjamin was writing, transsexual implied male-to-female, and attracted to men. For a time in the 1980s terms which SJ Wahng describes as homosexual transsexual were in the DSM-III-R (transsexual, homosexual subtype) Tamara Shefer said that the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR stipulate that the sex a transsexual is attracted to be specified as \"attracted to males, females, both or neither\".\n\nOthers, such as biologist and linguist Bruce Bagemihl, agree with what Benjamin wrote about the use of this term. Bagemihl wrote that this terminology makes it easy to say transsexuals are really homosexual males seeking to escape from stigma. Sexologist Jim Weinrich opined that sexologist Ray Blanchard looked for information to support his theory instead of letting the evidence guide his theorizing, by using \"a series of clever questionnaires and plethysmographic studies.\" Weinrich said that Blanchard asserted all female-to-male transsexuals were \"woman loving\". Leavitt and Berger criticized the term in 1990, saying that it was \"both confusing and controversial among males seeking sex reassignment.\" Critics argue that the term \"homosexual transsexual\" is \"heterosexist\", \"archaic\", and demeaning because it labels people by sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity. Benjamin, Leavitt, and Berger have all used the term in their own work. Sexologist John Bancroft also expressed regret for having used this terminology, which was standard when he used it, to refer to transsexual women. He says that he now tries to choose his words more sensitively.\n\nProfessor of anatomy and reproductive biology, Milton Diamond (1990, 2002) proposed the use of the terms androphilic and gynephilic as alternatives to homosexual and heterosexual. Diamond wrote that the terms homosexual and heterosexual are confusing as applied to transsexual persons because it is not instantly clear whether they reference the pre- or post-transition state. S.J. Wahng said in 2004 that the diagnosis homosexual transsexual is archaic and conflates homosexuality with transsexuality.\n\nSexological research has been done using these alternative terms by researchers such as Sandra L. Johnson (1990). In research done by Blanchard in 1985, and Leavitt they used a psychological test called the \"modified androphilia scale\" to assess whether a transsexual was homosexual or not.\n\nAccording to Leavitt and Berger, \"transsexuals, as a group, vehemently oppose the label and its pejorative baggage.\" Trans woman Andrea James has called the term \"inaccurate and offensive,\" and trans man Aaron Devor wrote, \"If what we really mean to say is attracted to males, then say 'attracted to males' or androphilic... I see absolutely no reason to continue with language that people find offensive when there is perfectly serviceable, in fact better, language that is not offensive.\"\n\nBuilding on work by Freund, Frank Leavitt and Jack C. Berger in 1990 further categorized homosexual transsexuals by three patterns of sexual activity in how they used their penis. In their study 44% were sexually inactive, 19% avoided use of the penis during sex, and 37% derived pleasure from using the penis during sex. The groups showed varying levels of masculinity and emotional disturbance in development. Leavitt and Berger found that transsexuals in the avoidant group are different from those in the other two groups. They fit the description of the \"nuclear transsexual\". They had a strong cross gender identification, wanted female anatomy, had never married and little to no sexual activity with females. Of all the subgroups this group had the least comorbid psychopathology. The transsexuals in the pleasure group behaved sexually in ways that were \"classically homosexual\". They were more likely than those in the avoidant group to have had sexual experience with females. They also rated higher on a test of general fetishism. Other than this, transsexuals in the pleasure group were similar to the description of a \"nuclear transsexual\". They found that transsexuals in the inactive group had characteristics which most differed from that of the \"nuclear transsexual\", such as strong heterosexual orientations (as determined from psychological testing), and fetish histories. \"The pattern exhibited generally conforms to that exhibited by heterosexual transsexuals.\" The inactive group was found to share little with the other groups of transsexuals other than a stated sexual interest in males. Leavitt and Berger also mentioned studies by Blanchard which suggest that heterosexual transsexuals will adjust their life stories to ensure that they get sex reassignment surgery. (Leavitt 1990)\n\nIn \"The Man Who Would Be Queen\", J. Michael Bailey (2003) wrote that the homosexual transsexuals he studied are comfortable with prostitution, and that they have a masculine sexual appetite, but are attracted to men. He reviewed evidence for a taxonomy according to which there are two forms of transsexualism in males, one that is an extreme type of homosexuality and one that is an expression of a paraphilia known as autogynephilia. In \"The Transsexual Phenomenon\" (1966), Harry Benjamin writes that \"Other transsexuals find prostitution a useful profession for emotional as well as practical reasons...\" Benjamin goes on to say \"How much more can his femininity be reaffirmed than by again and again attracting normal, heterosexual, and unsuspecting men and even being paid for rendering sex service as a woman?\"\n\nResearchers have recently found several demographic features that homosexual transsexuals tend to have in common. Ken Zucker (2002) and Yolanda Smith (2005) independently found that homosexual transsexuals were lower in IQ, social class, and age than non-homosexual transsexuals. They were, on average, in their mid-teens to mid-20s when they reported to a gender clinic for sex reassignment.\nThe homosexual transsexuals are more likely to have recent immigrant status, nonintact families, non-Caucasian race, and childhood behavior problems). Bailey found that most homosexual transsexuals learn to live on the streets, resorting to prostitution, or shoplifting.\n\nD.F. MacFarlane studied transsexuals in Australia and New Zealand. MacFarlane found that in New Zealand that 90% of the homosexual transsexual prostitutes were Māori, an ethnic group who are only 9% of the overall population. In \"The Man Who Would Be Queen\" J. Michael Bailey writes that about 60% of homosexual transsexuals he studied in Chicago were Latina or black; in his studies of gay males only 20% were non-white.(Bailey 2003) Bailey quoted the opinions of two of his subjects who attributed the difference to genetics, or inflexible gender roles in their respective cultures. MacFarlane similarly concluded that culture influenced the number of Māori homosexual transsexuals he observed.\n\nRecent research on the causes of homosexual transsexualism, transsexualism, and homosexuality overlap to a large degree. The etiology of transsexualism concerns the causes of transsexuality in general, including the theory that transsexualism is caused by differences in specific areas of the brain, while relationships between biology and sexual orientation have been studied in depth as possible causes of homosexuality.\n\nBlanchard (1996) and Zucker (2007) came to the general conclusion that birth order has some influence over sexual orientation in biological males in general, and homosexual male-to-female transsexuals in specific. This phenomenon is called the \"fraternal birth order effect\". In 2000 Richard Green wrote \"Homosexual male-to-female transsexuals have a later than expected birth order and more older brothers than other subgroups of male-to-female transsexuals. Each older brother increases the odds that a male transsexual is homosexual by 40%.\" Green did not find a higher incidence of homosexuality in the younger brothers of homosexual transsexuals.\n\nZucker and Blanchard wrote that studies have consistently supported the \"fraternal birth order effect\" that homosexual transsexuals have more brothers than sisters and are born later in birth order. In contrast, in their study using an Asian sample they found that the transsexual men had significantly more sisters than controls. Zucker attributes this to the preference for males in Korean society causing parents to stop having children once they have a boy. Therefore, all male children are less likely to have older brothers and hence no fraternal birth order effect is observed. According to Bailey's interpretation of Blanchard's theory the causes of homosexual transsexuality are extreme examples of the causes of homosexuality in males.\n\nSexologist Ray Blanchard defined this category in his research, based on testing or self-report, and asserted based on his research that self-report is not always reliable. Morgan (1978), Blanchard (1985), Lawrence (2005) and other researchers have asserted that many \"non-homosexual\" transsexuals systematically distort their life stories because \"non-homosexuals\" were often screened out as candidates for surgery and because some see \"homosexual transsexual\" as a more socially desirable diagnosis. According to Blanchard (1985, 1987) key characteristics include conspicuous cross-gender behavior from childhood through adulthood, and a \"homosexual\" sexual orientation. Blanchard also says that non-homosexual transsexual women (as well as all other non-homosexual male gender dysphorics) have a condition called autogynephilia and are aroused by the idea or image of themselves as women. Blanchard (1987) found in his studies that homosexual transsexuals were younger when applying for sex reassignment, reported a stronger cross-gender identity in childhood, had a more convincing cross-gender appearance, and functioned psychologically better than \"non-homosexual\" transsexuals. A lower percentage of the homosexual transsexuals reported being (or having been) married and sexually aroused while cross-dressing. Studies have variously found that between 10% and 36% of homosexual transsexuals report a history of sexual arousal to cross dressing. Bentler (1976) found 23%, while Freund (1982) reported 31%.\n\nPrevious taxonomies, or systems of categorization, used the terms \"classic transsexual\" or \"true transsexual,\" terms once used in differential diagnoses. Blanchard (1995) also said homosexual transsexuals were comparatively shorter and lighter in proportion to their height than non-homosexuals. Independent research done by Johnson (1990) and Smith (2005) concur with most of Blanchard's observations. Smith did not find a significant difference in height-weight ratio. Subsequent research has found only partial support of Smith's findings. Johson's 1990 work used the alternative term \"androphilic transsexual\", Johson wrote that there was a correlation between social adjustment to the new gender role and androphilia.\n\nIn 2000 Meredith L. Chivers and Bailey wrote \"Transsexualism in genetic females has previously been thought to occur predominantly in homosexual (gynephilic) women.\" According to them Blanchard reported in 1987 that only one in 72 female-to-male transsexuals he saw at his clinic were primarily attracted to men. They write that these individuals were so uncommon that some researchers thought that androphilic female-to-male transsexuals did not exist or they were misdiagnosed them as homosexual transsexuals, attracted to women. Relatively few studies have examined childhood gender variance in biological females.\n\nIn the 2005 study by Smith and van Goozen, their findings in regards to female-to-male transsexuals were different from their findings for male-to-female transsexuals. Smith and van Goozen's study included 52 female-to-male transsexuals, who were categorized as either homosexual or non-homosexual. Smith concluded that female-to-male transsexuals, regardless of sexual orientation, reported more GID symptoms in childhood, and a stronger sense of gender dysphoria. Smith wrote that she found some differences between homosexual and non-homosexual female-to-male transsexuals. Smith says that non-homosexual female-to-males reported more gender dysphoria than any group in her study. Smith says \"It is of interest, though, that a few female-to-male transsexuals reported to have been sexually aroused in adolescence when dressing in male clothes, as this has never been reported before.\"\n\nThe concept that androphilic male-to-female transsexualism is related to homosexuality in masculine homosexual males has been tested by MRI studies. These studies have been interpreted as supporting Blanchard's transsexualism typology. These studies show neurological differences between homosexual transsexuals and controls as well as differences between homosexual and non-homosexual transsexuals.\n\nA more precise recent study looked at the brains of homosexual aspiring transsexual males and females who reported to a gender clinic who had also not had any hormonal treatments. The question the research wished to address was the existence of any differences between transsexual and non-transsexual brains. Wishing to avoid clouding the issue with a sample of mixed sexual orientations given Blanchard's theory was their stated reason for selecting homosexual transsexuals. This study also controlled for possible influence of external hormones by looking at subjects who had not taken any yet. The study found the following in its sample of homosexual transsexuals:\n\n\n"}

Though these Turkic people are most famous for hunting with golden eagles, they have been known to train northern goshawks, peregrine falcons, saker falcons, and more.\n\nIn both Kazakh and Kyrgyz, there are separate terms for those who hunt with birds of prey in general, and those who hunt with eagles.\n\nIn Kazakh, both \"qusbegi\" and \"sayatshy\" refer to falconers in general. \"Qusbegi\" comes from the words \"qus\" (\"bird\") and \"bek\" (\"lord\"), thus literally translating as \"lord of birds.\" In Old Turkic, \"kush begi\" was a title used for the khan's most respected advisors, reflecting the valued role of the court falconer. \"Sayatshy\" comes from the word \"sayat\" (\"falconry\") and the suffix \"-shy\", used for professional titles in Turkic languages. The Kazakh word for falconers that hunt with eagles is \"bürkitshi\", from \"bürkit\" (\"golden eagle\"), while the word for those that use goshawks is \"qarshyghashy\", from \"qarshygha\" (\"goshawk\").\n\nIn Kyrgyz, the general word for falconers is \"münüshkör\". A falconer who specifically hunts with eagles is a \"bürkütchü\", from \"bürküt\" (\"golden eagle\").\n\nIn 936-45 AD the Khitans, a nomadic people from Manchuria, conquered part of north China. In 960 AD China was conquered by the Song dynasty. From its beginnings, the Song dynasty was unable to completely control the Khitan who had already assimilated much of Chinese culture. Throughout its 300-year rule of China, the Song had to pay tribute to the Khitan to keep them from conquering additional Song territory. Despite the fact that the Khitans assimilated Chinese culture, they retained many nomadic traditions, including eagle hunting (see the unknown Chinese painting from Song dynasty).\n\nMany Jurchen tribes hunted the hai dong qing, the Khitan tried to take the eagle hunting for themselves by force, but it did not end in the Khitan's favour. The Jurchen started a revolt against them, which let them regain access to the hai dong qing that they hunted previously.\n\nIn 1207, the Kyrgyz nomads surrendered to Genghis Khan's son Jochi. Under Mongol rule, the Kyrgyz preserved their nomadic culture as well as eagle falconry tradition until the 1990s. Archaeologists trace back falconry in Central Asia to the first or second millennium BC.\nDuring the communist period in Kazakhstan, many Kazakhs fled for Mongolia, settling in Bayan-Ölgii Province and bringing with them their tradition of hunting with eagles. There are an estimated 250 eagle hunters in Bayan-Ölgii, which is located in the Altai Mountains of western Mongolian. Their falconry custom involves hunting with golden eagles on horseback, and they primarily hunt red foxes and corsac foxes. They use eagles to hunt foxes and hares during the cold winter months when it is easier to see the gold colored foxes against the snow. Each October, Kazakh eagle hunting customs are displayed at the annual Golden Eagle Festival. Although the Kazakh government has made efforts to lure the practitioners of these Kazakh traditions back to Kazakhstan, most Kazakhs have remained in Mongolia.\n\n\n\n"}

The survey revealed a number of problems: Ukrainian legislation didn’t allow women to be assigned to combat positions, so they were enlisted as cooks, seamstresses, cleaners, accountants etc. while taking part in military combat operations as snipers, grenade launcher operators, reconnaissance soldiers, artillerists etc. This was done on semi-legal grounds. Thus, the majority of women who served in the war in Donbass were not enlisted officially and subsequently had no access to social or military benefits, military awards, social status, or career opportunities in the Armed Forces. \nWith the support of Ukrainian Women's Fund and UN Women, the \"Invisible Battalion\" survey turned into an ambitious photo project: about half a hundred portraits of Ukrainian women combatants were shot and exhibited at the Ukrainian Parliament and the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.\nIn 2016 the Invisible Battalion year calendar won the Grand Prix at the National Festival of Social Advertising. \n\nLater on, the Invisible Battalion social project turned into a full-length documentary Invisible Battalion: six stories of six women who were (or are) combatants at war in the East of Ukraine. Three women directors–Iryna Tsilyk, Alina Gorlova, and Svitlana Lischynska–offer female perspectives on war that are bluntly honest. This documentary is a female account of war in the East of Ukraine.\n\nBoth as a result of the campaign, and the pressure of society and different international organizations the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine expanded the number of military jobs (63 in total) available to women (Directive #292 “On expanding military jobs for soldier, sergeant, and officer staff) . However, even now of soldier and officer jobs are still unavailable to women. Moreover, women don’t have equal access to military education and careers.\n\nInvisible Battalion is still fighting for the legal status of women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the civil rights of women veterans and other aspects of female involvement in the military.\n"}

It is nearly extinct and the Jalabe (as speakers of the language are called) often use the Bwilim dialect of the Dikaka language in daily life, and the few remaining speakers of Jalaa, all elderly, are much more fluent in Dikaka than Jalaa.\n\nThe Jalabe are said to have come to Loojaa from an area a few miles south within the Muri Mountains, where they had shared a settlement with Tso and Kwa clans. (The name of this settlement, Cèntûm or Cùntûm, is used as a name for the language in some sources.) Later, during the nineteenth century, the Dikaka arrived in the area, fleeing attacks from the larger Waja to the north; the Cham intermarried with the Jalabe, and the Jalabe began to adopt the Dikaka language.\n\nThe Jalaa lexicon is also strongly influenced by Dikaka (which it has in turn influenced); some similarities are also found with the nearby Tso. However, most of its vocabulary is extremely unusual. In Kleinewillinghöfer's words, \"The major part of the lexicon seems to differ entirely from all the surrounding languages, which themselves represent different language families.\"\n\nBoth Dikaka and the Tso traditionally avoided using names of the dead.

The first Latin American country that Japanese people settled was Brazil. But when Brazil decided to halt Japanese immigration in the 1930s, a Japanese land company built an agricultural settlement southeast of Asunción. Two more colonies near Encarnación followed in the 1950s; many Japanese settlers came from neighboring Bolivia. During World War II, many Japanese Paraguayans were accused, alongside German Paraguayans and Italian Paraguayans. Until the end of World War II, many Japanese refugees arrived. The Japanese and Paraguayan governments made a bilateral agreement in 1959 to continue Japanese settlement in Paraguay. Although most ethnic minorities chose urban life, Japanese remained in agriculture- there were 8,000 Japanese settlers in rural colonies in the 1980s. The remaining Japanese settlers who are living in urban areas number 2,321. In spite of the long period of Japanese settlement in the country, there was a strong stigma against Japanese-Paraguayan intermarriage, but a number of Japanese Paraguayans are Eurasians of Spanish and Japanese descent or of other European (mostly German or Italian) and Japanese descent.\n\nBy the late 1960s to present, Japanese Paraguayans speak Japanese, Spanish, and Guaraní. The earliest settlement supported a parallel educational system with subjects taught entirely in Japanese; the colonists eventually limited this to supplemental Japanese-language classes.\n\nFirst-generation Japanese Paraguayans were generally followers of Shinto and Buddhism. The first Japanese settlers at La Colmena brought a piece of stone from the Ise Shrine which was gazetted as a monument mark the settlement's founding. Japanese religious festivals were celebrated within the first few decades among the first and second-generation Japanese settlers, and in the late 1960s a majority identified themselves with the Buddhist and Shinto faiths. Conversion to Roman Catholic Christianity increased from the late 1970s onwards.\n\nThere is a Japanese international school in Asunción: the \"Colegio Japonés en Asunción\" (アスンシオン日本人学校 \"Asunshion Nihonjin Gakkō\") and the Japanese Association of the East \"Asociación Japonesa del Este\" and the \"Escuela Japonesa de Ciudad del Este\" Primary School in Ciudad del Este.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6612137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6612137", "title": "Kuria people", "text": "Kuria people\n\nThe Kurya (also known as AbaKurya, as they prefer to call themselves) are a community of Bantu people who inhabit Tanzania and Kenya.\n\nThe people now known as AbaKurya are of diverse origins and clans. Before the twentieth century, they did not refer to themselves as the AbaKurya but by their various clans, or by the \"provinces\" from which they came.\nThe Kurya people known as the Abakurya live astride the Kenyan-Tanzanian border and in South Nyanza on the Kenyan side. They are divided into clans (\"ibiaro\") which some researchers refer to as sub-tribes, but they are not real sub-tribes as the differences among the clans are minor. The laws and practices are the same and the language is also the same among all clans with minor variations.\n\nEach clan inhabits a geographically defined area, that is, the clans are localised. Each clan is divided into sub-clans called \"ibisaku\"; into generation-sets known as \"amakora\" of which there are only eight (8) and the same in all clans; and into age-sets referred to as \"ichisaro\". Every clan has its own council of elders (\"inchama\") who controlled the clan (\"ikiaro\", singular) as political and religious leaders. The Abakurya believed in taboos and superstition and they generally feared punishment from the \"inchama\" for not observing the taboos. The punishment could be either death or barrenness or other misfortunes. The Abakurya customary law is made up of rules and practices accepted and sanctioned by the community. The custom had many do's and don'ts (taboos/superstitions) called \"imigiro\". Even the marriage laws were full of taboos and superstition and there was automatic punishment for breaking these \"imigiro\". Hence the laws were followed so strictly both before and after colonization, because after colonization the Abakurya went back to their original life and were not influenced by westernization.\n\nTheir strictness made Abakurya marriages (\"oboteti\") binding to the extent that divorce was something almost impossible. Their marriage was potentially polygamous like any other customary marriage in Kenya. Marriage was valued very much, as one way of family sustenance and continuation. As such everybody had to marry and get married. Even for someone who was naturally incapable of marrying on his own like the lunatic, the dead, the cripple (\"irigata\") among others, there was a way of ensuring that there was a wife in his name. There was also a way of caring for the barren or childless through marriage so that their houses would not be extinguished. There was no singlehood as a marital status to adults and as such even the divorcees had to remarry and every man had to marry in order to establish his own home (\"umugi goe\"). Also every woman had to be married to establish her own house (\"inyumba yae\"). \"Umugi\" and \"inyumba\" had to be sustained, that is, had to continue growing at whatever cost. All these factors led to certain marriages like ghost marriages, female to female (\"busino\") and others. The stigma and disregard attached to divorcees, and given the fact that everyone had to marry, made people stick to their marriages however frustrating or bad some of them were.\n\nThe homeland of the Abakurya is between River Migori to the east and the eastuary of River Mara to the west. The area stretches from Migori District, Kenya on the east to Musoma District, Tanzania on the west. To the south their land borders Transmara District in Kenya and the Nguruimi area in Tanzania. To the north is Lake Victoria, with a small corridor occupied by the Luo and some other Bantu peoples.\n\nThe Abakurya are found both in Kenya and Tanzania. In Kenya they live in Kurya East (headquartered in Kegonga) and Kurya West districts (headquartered in Kehancha). In Tanzania they live in Serengeti, Tarime, Musoma town, Musoma rural, Bunda and some parts of Mwanza districts. Mara as a province in Northern Tanzania has mostly been occupied by the Abakurya since recent times.\n\nThe immediate neighbours of the Abakurya are the Maasai, Kalenjin (Kipsigis clan in Transmara west), Ikoma, Luo and Suba.\n\nSocially, The Abakurya are divided into several clans which live both in Kenya and in Tanzania.\nIn Kenya, there are 4 clans found: the Abagumbe, Abairege, Abanyabasi and Abakira. In Tanzania there are 13: the Abapemba, Ababurati, Abakira, Abamera, Simbete, Abanyabasi, Watobori, Abakunta, Wiga, Kaboye, Abakenye, Abagumbe and Wasweta, Abatimbaru, with other minor clans.\n\nThe Abakurya are traditionally a farming community, mainly planting maize, beans and cassava as food crops. The cash crops grown include coffee and maize. Tobacco has over time been phased as a cash crop among the people. The Kurya also keep cattle and in times past, this used to lead to inter-clan and/or intertribal clashes over cattle rustling.\n\nThe name Kurya seems to have been applied to the whole group by the early colonial chiefs mainly to distinguish them from the other Luoised groups along the southern shores of Lake Victoria who were known as Abasuba (a name which at times also included the Abakurya proper). \nThe Abagusii state that their ancestors originally came from \"Misiri\" and that they migrated with the ancestors of the Abakurya, Abalogoli, Ababukusu, and Abasuba and that they lost contact with these people in the Mount Elgon area. The Abagusii and Abalogoli followed river Nzoia Valley which eventually took them to the northern shores of Lake Victoria probably between AD 1500 and 1560. At this early stage there doesn't seem to have been significant differences between the Abagusii, Abakurya, Abalogoli and Abasuba among others. Their distinctive names and identities appear to have developed much later when they had separated into their present homelands.The origin of the name Kurya is a thorny point in Abakurya history. The major Abakurya sub-tribes such as Abanyabasi, Abatimbaru, Abanyamongo, Abakira, Abairegi, Abakenye,Abanchaari, and Abagumbe have traditions to the effect that their ancestor was Mokurya (or Mukurya) who lived in \"Misiri\". His descendants migrated from \"Misiri\" and after many years of wandering on the other side of Lake Victoria, they eventually reached and settled in the present Bukurya.\nAccording to this tradition, the Abakurya have been divided from time immemorial into two \nfamilies: the Abasai of the elder wife of Mokurya and the Abachuma of the younger wife. But this \ntradition does not explain how the Abakurya people got their generation sets, such as Maina, \nNyambiriti, Gamnyeri on the Abasai side, and Mairabe (Norongoro), Gini, Nyangi on the \nAbachuma side. These generation set names are also found among other people such as the \nAbabukusu, Kalenjin, Agikuyu, Aembu/Ambeere and Ameru. It is therefore most probable that \nthe early Abakurya people who brought the generation set system into Abakurya society were a \nsplinter group from a much larger community living in the area of Mount Elgon from which the \nKalenjin people, a section of the Ababukusu and the Agikuyu clusters emerged. Paul Aseka Abuso \nin his book A Traditional History of the Abakurya has written thus: Abakurya section of the Abagumbe, Abapemba, Abaasi and Abasonga also state in their tradition that they travelled together with the ancestors of the Kikuyu among other people from Misiri to \nLake Baringo in the Kenya Rift Valley where they finally separated. Although Kikuyu history \ndoes not corroborate this point it looks as if at one time the ancestors of these people originally \nlived together in some area north of Mount Elgon. Perhaps the people known as Sirikwa mentioned above were part of that larger ancestral community — or possibly their descendants. \nThis is not yet clear.\n\nThe other view of the origin of the name Kurya is as follows. Between about 1774 and 1858, some \nof the Abakurya people were living in Musoma district in the present Tanzania and were settled \nin a hilly area north of the River Mara then known as Korea hill. The inhabitants of that area in \ntime became known as Korea people after the name of the hill, which eventually changed to \nKurya hill whereby the people became known as the Abakurya. The divergent views on the origin \nof the name would explain why the name had not gained wide acceptance among the Abakurya \neven at the beginning of the last century, as people still largely identified themselves by the sub-group names. During the colonial period, it was the name Abatende (after the Abatende clan in Bugumbe area) rather than Abakurya, which was in common use among the Kenya Abakurya. \nThose living in Tanzania continued to be known by their totems. It is only in about the 1950s that \nthe name Abakurya gained wide usage. In a similar manner the Mijikenda, Abaluyia and Kalenjin \nbecame generally accepted as collective ethnic names in the 1940s and 1950s, at a time when in \nKenya they were seeking political recognition by the colonial authorities.\n\nThe Abakurya people appear to have sprung from too many directions to have a common \nhistorical origin, although a number of clans claim to have come from Egypt. The culture of the \npresent Abakurya therefore is an amalgam of many different cultures which may originally have \nbeen opposed to each other in content and practice. Among the Abakurya today are found people \nwho were originally from the Kalenjin, Maasai, Bantu and Luo speaking communities. \nBetween AD 1400 and 1800 when migrations into Bukurya took place, the foundation was laid for \nthe future Abakurya cultural and political developments. Early inhabitants of Bukurya came from \nboth Bantu and Nilotic speakers who brought into Bukurya their peculiar cultures. Predominantly \nagricultural Bantu came into close contact with predominantly Nilotic pastoralists. Thus a blend \nof cultures took place among the early inhabitants of Bukurya from the start by combining \nagricultural practice with pastoral pursuit as well as tendencies towards nomadic life. Today \nelements of Abakurya agriculture is much like that of the Abagusii and the Luo while in cattle \nkeeping they have borrowed the practices of the Maasai, Zanaki and Nguruimi. \nBefore the population had increased very much, it appears that a number of the Abakurya \ncommunities developed independently without many interactions with the others. Many of those \nwho lived at the foothills of such places as Gutura, Maheta and Gwasi tended to carry on with \ntheir mode of life as if there were no other people around them. During the seventeenth and the \neighteenth centuries, more and More immigrants settled into the region and whether they liked it \nor not, the earlier communities were forced to interact with the new arrivals or at any rate to \nconfront them. Some of the newcomers were aggressive and would not let their neighbours live \nin peace as they engaged in raiding for cattle and at times fought for dominance in the region. \nThis meant that the small family clusters that had hitherto lived peacefully in the region shifted \nlocation and internal migration and resettlements were a continuous and repetitive process \nwithin and around Bukurya. In this way new social groups were formed. Many of these new \nsocieties were often swelled by splinter groups running away from other broken-up communities as a result of disruptions of war and raids. The Abamerani, for example, are said to have \nswallowed up many other clans.\n\nIn 2006 the Kurya population was estimated to number 909,000, with 608,000 living in Tanzania and 301,000 in Kenya. The latest (2012) anthropological research estimate the population of the Abakurya in Kenya to be about 650,000 and those of Tanzania to about 700,000.\n\nThe Kurya people were mainly pastoralists in the pre-colonial era but currently the Kenyan kuryans lean towards crop production and the Tanzanian Kuryans learn more towards pastoralism. The Abakurya are said to have abandoned Pastrolism after they were forced to do so by the Germans when they landed in the modern-day Northern Tanzania. The Kuryans in the Serengeti district are distinctly pastoralist. Details on how Abakurya started crop production and abandoned pastrolism will be available as a researcher is currently working on the same.\n\nThe Kurya are closely related to the Kisii people of Kenya both in language and physique among other cultural practices and beliefs.\n\nSOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANIZATION\nThe Abakurya people appear to have sprung from too many directions to have a common \nhistorical origin, although a number of clans claim to have come from Egypt.

Such naming will occur if the wish of the dead grandfather or mother requested to be named a boy or girl. That is why there is mwita for both girls and boys. Some for sake of love one would like to name the ancestors as a sign that the ancestor has been reborn. A child can have two names, one for obhotangi and another for endoko. For example, a boy can have one name from being a firstborn, and another name after his great-grandfather. The other cause of naming ancestors will result when the child is sick or misfortunes come to a family and they seek omogabho/omoraguli to find out the problem. The omoraguli will advise to name a child an ancestor whose spirits have been troubled by the family. When naming the child, the family will be required to sacrifice (kumwensa) a goat or a cow depending on the wish of the spirits and the magnitude of the problem. Similarly names like Nyamohanga, Ryoba, Magaigwa, Nsato, Sabure, Wankuru, Ng’oina, Wanchoka, Mwikwabhe are named after the spirits. That is why when Kuryas were baptized their native names were rejected because they were assumed to be associated with the spirits (Evil spirits?).\n\nWakurya have developed a generation system which place every individual in a generation group. There are two sets of generations\n\nThe first set is called Monyasae and the other is Monyachuma.\n\nThe Monyasae has a four circle generations as follows:\n\nThe Monyachuma has also four circle generations as follows:\n\nThe generations identifies an individual in the Kurya society. For example, a child of a Mosae from the monyasae generation circle will be a munyamburiti and will give forth to Omogamunyeri. No one is allowed to marry a child of the same generation. One generation circle is considered to last 25 years. A complete generation circle is hundred yearS. By knowing your generation you can easily calculate the age of your parents and grandparents. In the case of a mugamunyeri, his or her father is a Mnyamburiti.\n\nBy using the generation system you can even know when a major event took place by associating the event and those who witnessed the event if their generation is known e.g. Uhuru, Second World War etc.\n\nChange from childhood to adulthood is an important Kurya ritual which transform individual to another stage of life. The change known as \"saro\" is a passage to adulthood. Every boy or girl must pass through \"saro\" to be recognised as an adult; otherwise, he is \"Mulisya\" or \"Mosagane\".\n\nWhen one is circumcised he/she is placed into an age-set (\"esaro\"). It is not the purpose of this issue to describe the circumcision process but to emphasise the importance of the ritual. In Kurya society one is recognised by the age set group. All people circumcised at the same time are given an age set (\"saro\"). When a girl is married her age set group is changed to that of the husband if their \"saro\" are different. No one is allowed to marry children of same \"saros\", All ceremonies are done on the basis of \"saro\" or \"amakora\". One will not be allowed to marry or married if he has not gone through circumcision. In modern times boys are circumcised in hospitals and it is slowly being accepted but looked down as an inferior process. A real \"mkurya\" should face a \"mosali\" get circumcised without a wink.\n\nTraditionally, circumcision was done at the age around 13 years, but this differed significantly from one clan to another. The Abairege had most of their men circumcised at 15–18 years and above. However, this has changed to the onset of puberty. To this date, various organisations are working to ensure the tradition of female genital mutilation is aborted. Also, due to increased spread of HIV/AIDS organisations advocate for care during circumcision rituals. Many families are opting to take their children to hospitals and the traditional circumcision experts have now opted to use individual razors for each person during circumcision. After the cut, the boys or girls that have undergone the practice are normally led back home by fellow villagers amidst singing and dancing and money is pinned onto their \"shukas\". The \"shukas\" are one-piece coloured sheets that the circumcised tie around themselves so as to let the blood drip freely to the ground. Once circumcision has taken place, according to tradition, the boy or girl is deemed ready for marriage.\n\nWooden tools made by Abhabhachi (carpenters)\nStraw tools and vessels made by Abharuki (Weavers)\n\nPottery products made by Abhabhumbi (potters)\nKurya people also name their children according to an event which took place during the birth of a child. Some of the events are natural occurrences such as:\nThe list is not exhaustive.\n\nThe following list is some of the Kurya names and their literal meaning.

{"id": "35305476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35305476", "title": "Kwakum language", "text": "Kwakum language\n\nKwakum (ISO [kwu]) is classified as belonging to the Bantu subgroup A90 (Kaka) of the Zone “A” Bantu languages, and specifically labelled A91 by Guthrie. According to one of the newest updates to the Bantu classification system, other languages belonging to this subgroup are: Pol (A92a), Pɔmɔ (A92b), Kweso (A92C) and Kakɔ (A93). The Kwakum people refer to themselves (and their language) as either Kwakum or Bakoum (sometimes spelled Bakum). However, they say that the \"Bakoum\" pronunciation only began after the arrival of Europeans in Cameroon, though it is frequently used today. Kwakum is mainly spoken in the East region of Cameroon, southwest of the city Bertoua. \n\nKwakum is listed by Simons & Fennig as having three dialects: Til, Beten (or Mbeten, or Petem), and Baki (or Mbaki). According to David Hare, there are two main districts in which Kwakum is spoken: Dimako and Doumé. The Dimako district has 8 villages centered around the town of Dimako. The Doumé district has 8 villages centered around the town of Doumé. The lexical similarity between the Kwakum spoken in these two districts is 92.3%. Among these villages are the two villages of Baktala and Longtimbi. The people who live in these villages consider themselves to be Kwakum, but also call themselves Til. There is a lexical similarity of 91.4% between the Kwakum spoken in the Dimako district and the language spoken in the Til villages.\n\nThere are four villages of people who consider themselves to be Mbeten (and not Kwakum). The lexical similarity between the Kwakum of the Dimako district and the Mbeten villages is 81.3%. The Mbaki live far from the Kwakum and the lexical similarity is only 47.7%. It is thus unlikely that Mbaki should be considered a dialect of Kwakum.\n\nKwakum is a tonal language, and has been analyzed by Stacey Hare as having three tones.\n\nThe first analysis of Kwakum was completed in 2005 by François Belliard. Though this work focused on the music of the Kwakum, there is a brief description of the phonology and grammar. This dissertation was simplified into the form of a book entitled \"Parlons Kwakum\" (Let's Speak Kwakum) and published in 2007. Both works by Belliard are only available in French. \n\nDavid Hare completed an MA thesis entitled Tense in Kwakum Narrative Discourse in June 2018. Stacey Hare wrote her MA thesis on Tone in Kwakum (A91) with an application to orthography. Elisabeth Njantcho Kouagang wrote a doctoral dissertation entitled A grammar of Kwakum in 2018 as well. These three works are only available in English. All data used for David Hare's thesis can be found on his blog. \n"}

She formerly served as the Chief Technologist of the Federal Trade Commission, a position she held from January 2014 until December 2014. She has made several contributions to privacy technology. Her best known academic work is on the theory of \"k\"-anonymity and she is credited with the observation that \"87% of the U.S. population is uniquely identified by date of birth, gender, postal code.\"\n\nSweeney develops technology to assess and solve societal problems and teaches others how to use the same technology. She has made several discoveries related to identifiability and privacy technologies. Her work has received awards from numerous organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, the American Medical Informatics Association, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Her work was praised in the TAPAC Report that reviewed the Total Information Awareness Project of DARPA. She has testified before the Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee of the Department of Homeland Security and the European Union Commission. Sweeney was a Distinguished Career Professor of Computer Science, Technology and Policy in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2001, she received her PhD in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where she became the first African American woman to earn a PhD in computer science from that school. Her undergraduate degree in computer science was completed at Harvard University.\n\nSweeney went to Dana Hall Schools in Wellesley, MA, where she received her high school diploma in 1977. She delivered the valedictory at the graduation ceremony.\n\nSweeney did undergraduate studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she focused on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.\n\nShe went to Harvard Extension School to study Computer Science, where she received an ALB degree (Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies) in Computer Science, Cum Laude. Her undergraduate research thesis was called “A Coin Toss: the Dialectical Odds Aren't Always 50/50”. She received honors grades in all courses and completed graduate courses in computer science, mathematics, physics, educational psychology, and philosophy. She also delivered the graduation speech.\n\nSweeney returned to MIT to study for her master degree, where she received an S.M. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1997. During her studying of master degree, she received a GPA of 4.9/5.0. Sweeney wrote a Master's thesis called “Sprees, a Finite-State Orthographic Learning System that Recognizes and Generates Phonologically Similar Spellings”, where she was the finalist in MasterWorks. She continued to study at MIT for her Ph.D. degree, where she advanced in Computer Science. She received the degree in 2001 and finished her Ph.D. thesis “Computational Disclosure Control: Theory and Practice”.\n\nIn 2001, Sweeney became director and founder of the Data Privacy Lab, at Carnegie Mellon University. She was a member of the Program Committee for Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI) in 2005. In 2004, she founded the Journal of Privacy Technology, later becoming the editor-in-chief in 2006.\n\nIn her PhD dissertation at MIT (Computational Disclosure Control: Theory and Practice), Sweeney examines various computational methodologies for the secure dissemination of anonymous data without revealing any identifying, or potentially identifying, information. She proposes novel approaches for secure data disclosure, defining and describing null-map, k-map and wrong-map models of protection. Sweeney then critiques and compares four electronic data-based computational programs on their capacity to protect private information. The systems evaluated are her Scrub System, her Datafly II System, Statistics Netherlands’ u-Argus System, and her k-Similar algorithm – which she concludes as the most effective system in minimizing privacy risks. Prior to her dissertation, Sweeney has already been published numerous times, in topics pertaining to healthcare data security, and she has also completed a Masters Thesis at MIT and a ALB Thesis at Harvard. Currently, Sweeney is a prominent data security researcher and continues ongoing work to advance this field.\n\nWho Knows What About Me? A Survey of behind the Scenes Personal Data Sharing to Third Parties by Mobile Apps.\n\nBy conducting research on 110 mobile apps over 9 categories (including business, games, fitness & health etc.), Sweeney found that many mobile apps transmits sensitive personal data to third-party domains, particularly name, location and email etc. According to her study, Android apps send potential sensitive personal data to 3.1 third-party domains. As for iOS apps, they connected with an average of 2.6 third party domains. While increasing bringing up awareness for current risks for privacy leakage, Sweeney also inspires us to think about possible future sharing permission system on mobile phones.\n\nIn 2016 L. Sweeny, M. Bar-Sinai, M. Crosas, introduced Data Tags, Data Handling Policy Spaces and the Tags Language in IEEE Security and Privacy Workshops 2016 in San Jose CA. The paper introduces the Tags programming language and toolset which through questionnaires suggests data handling policies appropriate to the level of security the dataset requires. The Tags Language and Tools simplifies the development of security policies by recommending policies that meet the legal requirements for that dataset, like HIPAA.\n\nIn 1997, Sweeney conducted her first re-identification experiment wherein she successfully identified then Massachusetts governor, William Weld to his medical records using publicly accessible records. Her results had a significant impact on privacy centered policymaking including the health privacy legislation HIPAA, however publication of the experiment was rejected twenty times. The several re-identification experiments she conducted after this were met with serious publication challenges as well. In fact, a court ruling in Southern Illinoisian v. Department of Public Health barred her from publication and sharing of her methods for a successful re-identification experiment. Fear of publicly exposing a serious issue with no known solution fueled majority of the backlash against publication of her works and similar re-identification experiments for over a decade. Unless experiments concluded that no risk existed or that the issue could be resolved through reasonable technological advancement, publication was largely denied.\n\nIn her article “Only You, Your Doctor, and Many Others May Know,” writer Latanya Sweeney discusses her research project in which she located and matched up identities and personal health records through a number of methods. Such methods, as she explains in depth later on, include looking at public health records from hospitals and newspaper stories. Towards the end of the article, Sweeney touches upon the different approaches of how she analyzed and matched the data, either through using computer programs or human effort. She then makes the conclusion that new and improved methods of data sharing are necessary.\n\nSince 2011 Sweeney’s Data Privacy Lab has been conducting research about data privacy at Harvard. It intends to provide a cross-disciplinary perspective about privacy in the process of disseminating data. The Data Privacy Lab is sponsored by government, corporate, and nonprofit organizations. It is also in partnership with Berkman Klein Center, the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Center for Research on Computation and Society, and Program on Informational Sciences. One of her missions of the Data Privacy Lab includes creating a conversation about data in technology and policies on protecting personal data in technology. Sweeney’s Data Privacy Lab is working on 102 different projects regarding data privacy. Some of which include: The Genomic Privacy Project, Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery Project, Privacy-Enhanced Linking Project, and the Identifiability Project. The Genomic Privacy Project attempts to question the privacy of our genetic code and the use of genetic code to identify individuals. The Discrimination in Online Delivery Project examines the possibility of discrimination in the type of ads that show up in a search on a particular individual. There is a possibility that some searches will yield ads that are discriminatory to racial minorities. The Privacy-Enhanced Linking Project attempts to create algorithms in computer coding that will automatically protect privacy in the process of linking—which is the chain of searches that can be traced. The Identifiability Project examines how individuals can be identified through the use public census data. She argues that individuals can be identified using population census data through the combination of zip code, gender, and date of birth.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57530133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57530133", "title": "Mental timeline", "text": "Mental timeline\n\nA mental timeline is a mental representation of time that is spatial in nature. The mental timeline is similar to the mental number line where numbers are perceived increasing left to right. \n<br>\n\nEarlier time periods (the past) are associated with the left side of space and later time periods (the future) with the right. It is typically thought of as being presented left to right for populations who read left to right (e.g. English) and right to left for populations who read right to left (e.g. Arabic).\n\nOne rationale behind the connection between time and space is that space is an easier concept to understand than time. Space is three dimensional and can be perceived directly using visual sensors, that is, we can physically see a space. In contrast time is one dimensional and can only be perceived indirectly, for example, by seeing that a person has aged, we can infer that time has passed however we do not physically see time. There are many other examples of spatial representations of time around the world such as clocks, calendars and hourglasses. \n\nThis reasoning is also given for the use of spatial metaphors connecting the intangible concept of time with a more solid concept of space. Spatial metaphors such as, ‘there’s a big day ahead’ or ‘put the past behind you’ are common colloquialisms that represent the idea of a mental timeline. They provide linguistic evidence that our cognitive perception of time is linked to our representation of space.\n\nEvidence the mental timeline can be seen in experiments such as Santiago, Lupianez, Perez and Funes. The participant was shown a list of words categorized into the past or the future on either the left or the right of a computer screen. They were asked to respond by pushing a button either on the left or the right of the keyboard. In the first half of the experiment the left button meant past and right meant future, in the second half these were switched to mean the opposite. The study found that participants responded faster if the response key was aligned with the mental timeline. That is, the participant was faster to respond when the left key was aligned with the past and the right key with the future. This effect mimics the spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC) that is shown when testing for the mental number line. \n\nEvidence for this effect has also been shown using non-linguistic stimuli. Fuhrman and Boroditsky ran a similar experiment to the one described above but with pictorial cues rather than linguistic.Participants were shown pictures of a banana at three time points, unopened or ‘earlier’, half-peeled or ‘middle’ and empty banana peel or ‘later’. Again, participants were asked to respond by pushing a button either on the left or the right of the keyboard. The results showed the same effect as before, where response times were faster when the key was aligned with the direction of the mental timeline. \n\nThe effect of the mental timeline does not appear to be reliant on visual experience. An experiment using braille showed that blind participants had the same left to right mental timeline as sighted participants. It is thought to be due to the fact that both the sighted and blind participants, in this case, read left to right.\n\nThere is evidence that patients with left hemispatial neglect ignore the left side of the mental timeline. Saj, Fuhrmann, Boroditsky conducted an experiment where patients with left spatial neglect were measured against controls in remembering pictorial cues. The cues were pictures of food that a fictional character ‘David’ liked to eat. Foods David liked to eat in the past were shown with a white cap above them, while foods he will like to eat in the future were shown with a black top hat above them. The results showed that the participants with neglect recalled fewer items coded to the past and mislabelled more past items as future items than the control group. This suggests that the left side of time (the past) was neglected much like the patients have visual neglect of the left side giving more evidence to the use of the mental timeline.\n\n"}

It is produced by Lobsang Wangyal Productions.\n\nThe first-ever Miss Tibet Pageant was produced by Lobsang Wangyal in October 2002. The pageant was criticized as \"aping western culture\" and \"un-Tibetan\". The pageant has continued yearly since then.\n\nIn 2017 director Lobsang Wangyal announced that he would not continue organising the Pageant, and it could be sold to someone who would carry on its ideals.\n\nIn 2002, four Tibetan girls participated in the competition. Four editions of the Pageant's 15 year history—2003, 2005, 2013, and 2014—had only one participant. In 2006, the swimsuit competition was opened to the public.\n\nThe Miss Tibet Pageant 2012 was cancelled in response to increased tensions in Tibet and in support of the protests there.\n\nMiss Tibet 2002, Dolma Tsering, has competed in two international pageants. She also won the Miss Goodwill subsidiary title from the pageant in Malaysia and the Best National Costume from another pageant in Mexico.\n\nThe Dalai Lama considers the pageant unimportant, but it is still held due to popular demand.\n\nOf late, the Chinese government has interfered, pressuring international directors to name Miss Tibet as \"Miss Tibet-China\". Two Miss Tibets had to withdraw from international pageants — Zimbabwe and Malaysia — after they were asked to wear sashes with this title. Miss Tibet 2007 Tenzin Dolma was asked to wear such a sash in the Philippines at the last minute, but she refused, and was allowed to go ahead with the Miss Tibet sash. Miss Tibet 2006 Tsering Chungtak withdrew from the Miss Tourism Pageant in Malaysia after Chinese government representatives pressured the organiser to enter her as \"Miss Tibet-China\" in November 2007. Miss Tibet 2004 Tashi Yangchen had to withdraw from a pageant in Zimbabwe after the Chinese embassy in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, in a similar case of Chinese interference, asked her to wear a \"Miss Tibet-China\" sash in February 2005.\n\nIn October 2011, Tenzin Yangkyi, Miss Tibet 2011, was sent to the Miss Asia Pacific World 2011 beauty pageant, held in Daegu, Seoul, and Busan in South Korea. During the pageant, Yangkyi received pressure from the Chinese government to wear a sash saying \"Tibet-China\", but she refused. Instead, she decided to change the sash name to \"Swiss Tibet\", as she is a Swiss citizen.\n\nTenzin Paldon from Karnataka, India, was crowned Miss Tibet 2017 at the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts in McLeod Ganj, India, on 4 June 2017. She received Rs one lakh (100,000) (USD 2,200). Tenzin Khechoe was judged the first runner-up, receiving Rs 50,000. Tenzin Nordron was chosen as the second runner-up and was given a cheque of Rs 25,000. The winner and the First Runner-up also won a two-week trip to Vietnam, sponsored by Claire Huynh Hong Hai. The three judges for the event were Ms Tanshuman Gurung, Mr Abhishek Madhukar, and Ms Anshdeep Kaur.\n\nAt the finale of the event, director Lobsang Wangyal announced his intention to withdraw from organising the pageant, and sell it to someone who would carry it on with the same objectives.\n\n– Full 2017 contestant information\n\nTenzing Sangnyi was selected as Miss Tibet 2016.

She is multi-lingual and likes dancing, basketball, singing, painting and photography. Out of 8 applications received 5 were confirmed, but 4 withdrew at the last minute citing personal reasons.\n\nA coronation ceremony of the Miss Tibet 2013 was held in Bangalore as Tenzing Lhamo from Madison, US, was the only one to come to participate in the pageant. She donated the prize money of Rs 100,000 for Tibetan activism. The pageant was originally planned to be held in Bylakuppe, Karnataka, the largest Tibetan settlement in India.\n\nThe Miss Tibet Pageant 2012 was cancelled in response to increased tensions in Tibet and in support of the protests there. The Pageant was to be held in Dharamshala, India, from 8 to 10 June 2012.\n\nMiss Tibet Pageant 2011 was the 10th edition of the annual event. The pageant was held in Dharamshala from 3 to 5 June. Tenzin Yangkyi was selected by the judges as Miss Tibet 2011. She represented Tibet in the Miss Asia Pacific World 2011 beauty pageant.\n\nOn 5 June 2012 Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Foreign Correspondent program aired a report which had followed contestants preparing for and undertaking the Miss Tibet 2011 contest. The report outlined the contestant's understanding of how they would be judged - a judging panel of non-Tibetans would be marking the contestants presentations. At the end of the program controversy erupted when the winner was announced.\n\nOne contestant remarked that she thought Tenzin Khecheo would have won. Another stated \"I think Lobsang Wangyul cheated - he's a fraud.\" The pageant organiser, Lobsang Wangyal, was confronted by the contestants who wanted to know how the judging had been processed. At first Lobsang Wangyal claimed the marking sheets had been stolen. \"I don't have the judges' sheet. It was stolen ... on the night. ... It's not in the file. The file is empty. ... When I went onstage somebody stole it. I too was surprised.\" The contestants then pressed Lobsang Wangyal further, at which point he admitted the non-Tibetan judge's markings only affected 25% of the overall evaluation - that he himself controlled the remaining 75% of the marking, and as such, had effectively decided by himself which contestant had won. The confrontation then ended with the contestants walking out and stating to Lobsang Wangyal \"You are a fraud.\" To which Lobsang Wangyal responded \"Yeah ... yeah I am.\"\n\nLobsang Wangyal then made a follow up statement to the camera saying \"Miss Tibet should be someone who should be calm and, you know ... listen and ... be respectful and see ... if this is how Miss Tibetan will be ... oh my god ... no way.\"\n\nThe report then finished with a comment from Ngodop Dolma: \"When I look back into Miss Tibet what I've come to realise is that Lobsang's Miss Tibet does not empower Tibetan women but it does the opposite. It actually disempowers Tibetan women. So, I believe the only way it could have any values is if it were run by a woman.\"\n\nLobsang Wangyal responded a few months after the report was made through a posting on misstibet.com in which he says that Mr Gould's recruited contestant Ngodup Dolma made the accusation only after she was unsuccessful in the contest. In his statement Lobsang accepted that the folder containing the mark sheets of the finale night had been stolen after the coronation, and suggested that Mr Gould or an accomplice was involved.\n\n– Full contestant information\n\nTenzin Norzom from Varanasi, holder of a Shastri degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Arts in Buddhist Philosophy), was crowned Miss Tibet 2010 at the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts in McLeod Ganj, India, on 6 June 2010. She received one lakh (100,000.00) Indian rupees (equivalent to 2,200 USD). After the crowning, Norzom said she would use the title to promote the Tibetan cause.\n\nYangchen Metok, a 19-year-old girl who had escaped to India in 2008, was judged the first runner-up. She received Rs 50,000.00. Rinchen Choden, a 25-year-old hair stylist from Bangalore, was chosen as the second runner-up. She was given a cheque of Rs 25,000.00. The fourth place Tenzin Namchoe from Golok, Tibet, was given a token prize of Rs 10,000.\n\nConsidering the Kyigudo earthquake in eastern Tibet in April, the pageant was kept low-profile. No firecrackers were set off, but instead a short prayer session was held at the opening of the show. Lobsang Wangyal, the director and the producer of the event, gave Rs.10,000 in donation to the victims of the earthquake.\n\nKingfisher, a leading Indian brand, sponsored the pageant.\n\nMiss Tibet 2009 was held from 16–18 June 2009. The finale was held on 7 June at Tipa. The four participants arrived in McLeod Ganj on 28 May. A week's training was given from 29 May, until 4 June. The first round — the swim suit round — of the Miss Tibet pageant 2009 was held on 5 June. Two more rounds — talk and talent rounds — was held on 6 June. The remaining four rounds — introduction, evening gown, traditional costume and interview rounds — were held on 7 June at Tipa.\n\nThousands in the audience witnessed the crowning of Tenzin Choezom as the new Miss Tibet. Dr BK Modi, the Chairman of the Spice Corp, crowned the winner. He also presented a scholarship cheque of one lakh rupees (Rs 100,000) to Choezom. Ngawang Choying was picked the first runner-up and Dolkar the second runner-up by a four-member jury. Ngawang and Dolkar received scholarship cheques of Rs 50,000 and Rs 25,000 respectively. Yeshi was presented a consolation prize of Rs 5,000.\n\nMiss Tibet Pageant 2008 was held on Sunday 12 October 2008 at The Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts (TIPA), Dharamshala, India. Two young women competed for the crown — Sonam Choedon, who came from Tibet to India in June 2008, and Jamyang Chentso, born in India Sonam Choedon won the title.\n\nSonam Choedon is a student. She is currently learning languages: English and Hindi. She is fluent in Tibetan and Chinese.\n\nMiss Tibet Pageant 2007 was held from 12 to 14 October 2007 in McLeod Ganj, Dharamshala, India. Five young Tibetan women took part in the pageant. Tenzin Dolma from McLeod Ganj was crowned Miss Tibet 2007. She received a scholarship cheque of Rs 100,000 (2,500 USD). She represented Tibet in the Miss Earth 2007 pageant in the Philippines in November 2007.\n\nTsering Yangzom from Kollegal Tibetan settlement, south India, was the First runner-up. She received Rs 50,000 in scholarship. She was also the \"Miss Photogenic\", receiving 1170 of the 3156 votes cast online at misstibet.com.\n\nDeeki Dolma from Gangtok, Sikkim, was declared the Second runner-up. She received Rs 25,000.\n\n"}
{"id": "42004317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42004317", "title": "Monkeys in Chinese culture", "text": "Monkeys in Chinese culture\n\nMonkeys, particularly macaques and monkey-like gibbons, have played significant roles in Chinese culture for over two thousand years. Some examples familiar to English speakers include the zodiacal Year of the Monkey, the Monkey King Sun Wukong in the novel \"Journey to the West\", and Monkey Kung Fu.\n\nThe Chinese language has numerous words meaning \"simian; monkey; ape\". Some diachronically changed meanings in reference to different simians. For instance, Chinese \"xingxing\" 猩猩 originally named \"a mythical creature with a human face and pig body\", and became the modern name for the \"orangutan\".\n\nWithin the classification of Chinese characters, almost all \"monkey; ape\" words – with the exceptions of \"nao\" 夒 and \"yu\" 禺 that were originally monkey pictographs – are written with radical-phonetic compound characters. These characters combine a radical or classifier that roughly indicates semantic field, usually the \"dog/quadruped radical\" 犭 for simians, and a phonetic element that suggests pronunciation. For instance, this animal classifier is a graphic component in \"hou\" 猴 (with a \"hou\" 侯 \"marquis\" phonetic) \"macaque; monkey\" and \"yuan\" 猿 (with \"yuan\" 袁 \"long robe\") \"gibbon; monkey\".\n\nNote that the following discussion of \"monkey; ape\" terminology will cite three fundamental sources. The oldest extant Chinese dictionary, the (c. 3rd century BCE) \"Erya\" () glosses seven names for monkeys and monkey-like creatures in the 寓屬 \"Monkey/Wild Animal\" taxonomy. The first Chinese character dictionary, the (121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" defines many names of simians, primarily under the () in Chapter 11. The classic Chinese pharmacopoeia, Li Shizhen's (1597) \"Bencao Gangmu\" () lists medical uses for five \"Yu\" 寓 \"monkeys\" and three \"Kuai\" 怪 \"supernatural beings\". The latter are \"wangliang\" 魍魎 \"a demon that eats the livers of corpses\", \"penghou\" 彭侯 \"a tree spirit that resembles a black tailless dog\", and \"feng\" 封 \"an edible monster that resembles a two-eyed lump of flesh\".\n\nLi Shizhen distinguishes 11 varieties of monkeys: \nA small one with a short tail is called Hou ([猴] monkey). If it looks like a monkey but has a prominent moustache, then it is called Ju [狙]. If it looks like a monkey but is bigger, then it is Jue [貜]. A monkey that is big, with red eyes and a long tail, is called Yu [禺]. A monkey that is small but has a long tail and an upright nose is called You [狖]. A monkey that is similar to You but is bigger is called Guoran [果然]. A monkey that is similar to You but smaller is called Mengsong [蒙頌]. A monkey that is similar to You but jumps a lot is called Canhu [獑猢]. A monkey that has long arms is called Yuan ([猿] ape). A monkey that is similar to Yuan but has a golden tail is called Rong [狨]. A monkey that is similar to Yuan but bigger, and can eat apes and monkeys, is called Du [獨]. (s.v. \"Jue\", tr. Luo 2003: 4124, cf. Read 1931: no. 400B) \n\nNao 夒 was the first \"monkey\" term recorded in the historical corpus of written Chinese, and frequently appeared in (14th-11th centuries BCE) Shang dynasty oracle bone inscriptions. This oracle pictograph of \"a monkey\" showed its head, arms, legs, and short tail; which were convergented as 目/頁 (“head”/“eye”), 又/爪 (“hand”/“claw”) and later 止 (“foot”, which was a corruption from 爪 in this character), 已/巳 (\"finished\"/\"foetus\", which was corrupt from the tail) not later than the end of (6th century BCE) Spring of Autumn Period bronze script. Compare the seal character for \"kui\" 夔 \"a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon\", which resembles the seal character for \"nao\" with the addition of what appears to be long hair on its head.\n\nThis graphically complex character \"nao\" 夒 \"monkey\" had an early variant \"nao\" 獿 (with the \"quadruped\" radical and \"nao\" phonetic), and a simpler replacement \"nao\" 猱 \"monkey\" (same radical and a \"rou\" 柔 phonetic), which is common in modern usage.\n\nThe etymology of \"nao\" < *\"nû\" 夒 or 猱 \"monkey\" (Schuessler 2007:397) \"is elusive\", and may be connected with Proto-Mon–Khmer *\"knuuy\" \"macaque; monkey\" or Proto-Tibeto-Burman *\"mruk\"; compare *\"ŋoh\" 禺 next.\n\nThe first Chinese character dictionary, the (121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" defines \"nao\" 夒 as \"a greedy animal, generally said to be a \"muhou\" \"monkey\" resembling a person\" (貪獸也一曰母猴似人);, see \"muhou\" below.\n\nThe poet Li Bai alludes to \"nao\" (猱) populating the Taihang Mountains, in the north of China, near the capital city Chang'an, in the poem \"白馬篇\": it should be duly noted that this literary source contextually suggests a temporal location of the West Han era (Sun 1982:82-85).\n\nYu 禺 \"monkey\" appeared on (11th-3rd centuries BCE) Zhou dynasty Chinese ritual bronzes as a pictograph showing a head, arms, and a tail. \"Yu\" \"forenoon, 9 to 11 AM\" is the second of five daily divisions (更) in the traditional Chinese calendar. \"Banyu\" 番禺 was \"a district in Guangzhou\". In modern Chinese scientific usage, \"yu\" 禺 refers to the Central and South American \"spider monkey\".\n\nThe etymology of \"yu\" < *\"ŋoh\" 禺 \"monkey\" (Schuessler 2007:589-590) links with Kukish *\"ŋa:w\" \"ape\" > Lushai \"ŋau\" \"grey monkey\"; compare *\"nû\" 夒 above.\n\nThe \"Shuowen Jiezi\" defines \"yu\" 禺 as \"a kind of \"muhou\" \"monkey\" with a head resembling a \"gui\" \"ghost\"\" (母猴屬頭似鬼). Compare the above definition of \"nao\" as a \"muhou\" \"monkey\" resembling a person.\n\n\"Yu\" 禺 has a graphic variant \"yu\" 寓 (with the \"roof radical\") \"reside; imply\". The \"Erya\" (18) lists monkey definitions under a \"yushu\" 寓屬 \"wild animal category\". Guo Pu's commentary explains \"yu\" 寓 inclusively means all \"shou\" 獸 \"wild animals\", and van Gulik (1967:38) says it means \"primates in general\".\n\nThe \"Shanhaijing\" (tr. Birrell 1999:3) uses \"yu\" 禺 to describe the \"xingxing\", \"There is an animal on the mountain which looks like a long-tailed ape, but it has white ears. It crouches as it moves along and it runs like a human. Its name is the live-lively. If you eat it, you'll be a good runner\".\n\nThe \"Shanhaijing\" records a mythical \"yugu\" 禺谷 \"monkey valley\", the place where the sun sets, which suggests that \"the monkey is a kind of guardian of the approaches to the nether World\" (van Gulik 1967:38). Kuafu 禺谷 \"Boast Father raced with the sun and ran with the setting sun\", but died of thirst on the way (tr. Birrell 1999:123). \"Yugu\" is also written as \"yu\" 虞 \"predict; deceive\" or \"ou\" 偶 \"human image; mate\".\n\nHou 猴 \"monkey; macaque\" is a common name for simians. For instance, \"houzi\" 猴子 means \"monkey\" or \"clever/glib person\". Muhou 母猴 \"macaque; rhesus monkey\" compounds \"mu\" \"mother\" and \"hou\" \"monkey\", and can also mean \"female monkey\" in modern usage. Van Gulik (1967:35) says that \"muhou\" is a phonetic rendering of a non-Chinese term\" because \"mu-\" occurs in four variants: 母 and 沐 \"wash one's hair\" in Zhou texts, and 米 \"rice\" or 獼 in Han texts. In modern Chinese usage, \"mihou\" 獼猴 means \"macaque; rhesus monkey\". The etymology of \"hou\" < Old Chinese *\"gô\" 猴 \"monkey\" (Schuessler 2007:279) probably derives from Sino-Tibetan *\"ʔ-ko\". The first syllable in \"muhou\" < *\"môʔ-gô\" 母猴 or \"muhou\" < *\"môk-gô\" 沐猴 \"macaque\" may perhaps be a \"pre-initial\" supported by the Lolo-Burmese \"mjo kœ\" < *\"mjok\" \"monkey\", which might have been the source of Proto-Tocharian *\"moko\".\n\nLu Ji, who was from the southern state of Wu, noted \"muhou\" was a Chu word (tr. Van Gulik 1967:35): \"The \"nao\" is the macaque [\"mihou\"], called by the people of Chu [\"muhou\"]. After a macaque has grown old, he becomes a \"que\" [貜]. Macaques with long arms are called gibbons (\"yuan\"). Gibbons with a white waist are called [\"chan\" 獑].\" Van Gulik explains the legendary \"que\" with the grey whiskers of mature macaques, and associates the \"chan\" with the rhesus macaque, or \"huchan\" 胡獑, found in present day Yunnan.\n\nThe \"Shuowen jiezi\" defines \"hou\" as \"nao\", and defines \"nao\" 夒, \"yu\" 禺, \"jue\" 玃, and \"wei\" 蜼 as \"muhou\".\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" lists \"mihou\" synonyms of: \"muhou\" 沐猴, \"weihou\" 為猴, \"husun\" 胡孫, \"wangsun\" 王孫, \"maliu\" 馬留, and \"ju\" 狙; and Li Shizhen explains the names.\nThe book \"Baihu Tongyi\" by Ban Gu: Hou means \"wait\" [\"hou\" 候, n.b., \"hou\" 猴 does not occur in the received text]. When it sees a man put some food in a trap, it will stay in a higher position and look at the food for a long time. It is an animal that is good at waiting. The macaque likes to wash its face by rubbing, so it is called Mu [沐 \"washing\"]. The character was later distorted to Mu ([母] meaning \"mother\"), which is even further from the original meaning. The book \"Shuowen Jiezi\" (\"Book of Philology by Xu Shen\"): The character Hou looks like Muhou (monkey), but it is not a female monkey. As macaque looks like a person from the Hu region (the north and west of China where non-Han ethnic groups lived in ancient times), it is called Husun [胡孫]. In the book \"Zhuang Zi\", it is called Ju [狙]. People raise macaques in stables. In this way, horses will not be attacked by disease. So it is colloquially called Maliu ([馬留] meaning \"maintaining the horses\") in the Hu region (the north and west of China where non-Han ethnic groups lived in ancient times). In Sanskrit books it is called Mosizha [摩斯咤] (transliteration [of \"markaţa\"]). (tr. Luo 2003:4124, cf. Van Gulik 1967:35) \nBernard E. Read (1931: no. 400) notes, \"The menstrual discharge of the monkey [猴經] is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious disease\", and suggests the Sanskrit name \"is not so remote from the genus name \"Macacus\"\". \"Husun\" \"macaque; monkey\" is also written 猢猻, as punned in the surname of Sun Wukong 孫悟空 \"descendent/monkey awakened to emptiness\". \"Maliu\" 馬留 (lit. \"horse keep\") compares with the Cantonese \"malɐu\" \"monkey\" word (Schuessler 2007:580).\n\nYuan 猿 \"ape; monkey\" is used in Chinese terms such as \"yuanren\" 猿人 \"ape-man; Hominidae\" and \"Beijing yuanren\" 北京猿人 \"Peking Man\".\n\nThe etymology of \"yuan\" < *\"wan\" 猿 \"monkey\" (Schuessler 2007:593-59) could be linked with Proto-Tibeto-Burman *\"(b)woy\" or Proto-Mon–Khmer *\"swaaʔ\" \"monkey\".\n\n\"Yuanhou\" 猿猴 \"apes and monkeys\", according to Van Gulik (1967:33), originally meant only \"gibbons and macaques\" but in the last few centuries, it has been widely used in Chinese literature as a comprehensive term for \"monkeys\". The Japanese language word \"enkō\" 猿猴 is likewise means \"monkey\" in general.\n\nNaoyuan 猱蝯 compounds the \"nao\" 夒 variant 猱 with \"yuan\" 蝯 (combining the \"insect radical\" 虫 and \"yuan\" 爰 phonetic). \"Yuan\" has graphic variants of 猨 and 猿. The \"Erya\" defines \"The \"naoyuan\" is good at climbing\" (猱蝯善援), based upon a pun between \"yuan\" 蝯 \"monkey\" and \"yuan\" 援 \"pull up; climb\" (both characters written with the same phonetic element).\n\n\"Nao\" 猱 occurs once in the \"Classic of Poetry\", \"Do not teach a monkey to climb trees\" (毋教猱升木). Lu Ji's 3rd-century commentary says \"The \"nao\" is the macaque [\"mihou\"], the people of Chu call it \"muhou\" (see above). In disagreement, Van Gulik (1967:32) gives reasons why \"nao\" 猱 means \"gibbon\" not \"macaque\". First, the \"Erya\" stresses \"climbing\" as the simian's main characteristic. Second, Zhou dynasty texts record the \"nao\" as \"a typical tree-ape\". Third, numerous early literary sources use \"naoyuan\" or \"yuannao\" as a binomial compound.\n\nVan Gulik distinguishes \"nao\" 猱 \"gibbon\" from the homonym \"nao\" 獶 \"monkey\" (with a \"you\" 憂 phonetic replacing the uncommon 夒 in \"nao\" 獿)\n\nThe term \"nao\" 獿 occurs in the \"Record of Music\" chapter of the \"Book of Rites\" criticizing vulgar pantomimes (tr. Van Gulik 1967:32), \"Actors take part therein, and dwarfs who resemble \"nao\", men and women mix, and the difference between parents and children is not observed\"; \"here \"nao\" clearly means a macaque, familiar through the popular monkey-shows.\"\n\nVan Gulik (1967:33) suggests that Chinese \"yuan\" \"gibbon\" was a loanword from the language of Chu, the southernmost state of the Zhou realm. Qu Yuan's (c. 3rd-century) \"Chuci\" uses the term \"yuanyou\" 猿狖 three times (in \"Nine Pieces\"); for instance (tr. Hawkes 1985:160), \"Amid the deep woods there, in the twilight gloom, are the haunts where monkeys live.\" This text also uses \"yuan\" 猿 once (\"Nine Songs\"), \"yuan\" 蝯 once (in \"Nine Laments\"), and \"houyuan\" 猴猿 once (in \"Nine Longings\"). If \"yuanyou\" was Qu Yuan's (or another \"Chuci\" author's) rendering of a Chu word for \"gibbon\", then \"naoyuan\" can be understood as a compound of the native Chinese word \"nao\" \"monkey in general\" and the sinified loanword \"yuan\" \"gibbon\"; and gradually, \"\"nao\" 猱 came to mean \"gibbon\", whereas \"nao\" 獶 remained reserved for monkeys.\" \"You\" 狖 was (Van Gulik 1967:31) a Zhou synonym for \"gibbon\".\nDuring the first centuries of our era, the binoms \"naoyuan\" or \"yuannao\" were superseded as words for \"gibbon\" by the single term \"yuan\" 猨, written with the classifier \"quadruped\" instead of that for \"insect\" 虫; and one prefers the phonetic 袁 to 爰 (rarely 員). This character \"yuan\" 猿 has remained the exclusive term for the Hylobatidae as long as the Chinese in general were familiar with the gibbon. However, when in the course of the centuries more and more mountainous regions were brought under cultivation, and as the deforestation increased accordingly, the habitat of the gibbon shrank to the less accessible mountain forests in the south and south-west, and the Chinese had few opportunities for seeing actual specimens. Until about the 14th century A.D. one may assume with confidence that when a Chinese writer employs the word \"yuan\" 猿, he means indeed a gibbon. Thereafter, however, the majority of Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids – a confusion which has lasted till the present day. (1967:33)\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" (tr. Van Gulik 1967:33) notes that, \"the gibbon's meat may be taken as medicine against hemorrhoids, which may be cured also by always using a gibbon's skin as seat-cover. The fat used as ointment is said to be a wonderful cure for itching sores.\"\n\nRong 狨 was \"a long-haired monkey with golden fur that was highly prized\". Read (1931:401) suggests it is the \"lar gibbon, \"Hylobates entelloides\"\", and Luo (2003: 4125) identifies it as the golden snub-nosed monkey \"Rhinopitheeus roxellana\". In addition to meaning \"golden snub-nosed monkey\", Van Gulik (1967:36) and notes that in modern Chinese zoological terminology, \"rong\" denotes the Callitrichidae (or Hapalidae) family including marmosets and tamarins.\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" entry for the \"rong\" 狨 explains the synonym \"nao\" 猱 signifies this monkey's \"rou\" 柔 \"soft; supple\" hair.\nThe hair of the golden monkey is long and soft. So it is called Rong (meaning \"fine hair\"). Nao is a character meaning \"soft.\" Another explanation says that the animal is found in the western Rong region [Sichuan], so it is thus named. There is a kind of long-hair dog that is also called Nao. ... The book \"Tan Yuan\" [談苑] by Yang Yi (楊億): The golden monkey is found in the deep mountains in Sichuan and Shaanxi. It looks like an ape. It has a long tail of golden color. So it is colloquially called Jinsirong [金絲狨] (meaning \"golden thread monkey\"). It is quick at climbing trees. It loves its tail dearly. When shot by a poisonous arrow, it will bite off its own tail when poisoned. During the Song dynasty (960-1279), only officials of the administration and military of the third rank and above were allowed to use seats and bedding made of golden monkey hide. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401)\nThis entry has two subheadings: the \"yuan\" 猨 or \"changbeihou\" 長臂猴 \"gibbon, \"Hylobates agilis\"\" and the \"du\" 獨 (below).\nThe ape is good at climbing trees. It is found in the deep mountains in the Chuan and Guang regions. It looks like a monkey, but has very long arms. It is an animal that can practice [Daoist] \"qi\" (Vital Energy), so it lives a long life. Some say it has one arm stretching from one side to the other. This is not correct. Its arm bone can be made into a flute that sounds very clear and resonant. Apes come in different colors: blue-green, white, black, yellow and crimson. It is a kind and quiet animal, and likes to eat fruits. It lives in forests and can jump over a distance of several dozen \"chi\". But when it falls and drops onto the ground, it may suffer from excessive diarrhea and then die. Treatment is the drinking of juice of Fuzi/radix aconiti lateralis/daughter root of common monkshood. Apes live in groups. The male cries a lot. It makes three cries consecutively. The cry sounds miserable and is penetrating. The book \"Guihai Zhi\" [桂海志] by Fan Chengda: There are three varieties of apes: Yellow ones with golden thread; black ones with jade faces; and black ones with black faces. Some say the pure black one is the male, and the golden thread one is the female. A male one shouts and a female does not. The book \"Rixun Ji\" [日詢記] by Wang Ji: People in the Guang region say that when an ape is born, it is black and male, When it gets old, it turns yellow and its genitals become ulcerous, and then it turns into a female. Then it mates with the black one. After another several hundred years, the yellow ape will evolve into a white one. (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931 no. 401A)\n\nJuefu 貜父 \"a large monkey\" compounds \"jue\" \"an ape\" and \"fu\" \"father\". The character \"jue\" 貜 combines the \"cat/beast radical\" 豸 and a \"jue\" 矍 \"look startled\" phonetic (with two 目 \"eyes\"); compare the graphic variants of 玃 and 蠼. Based upon this phonetic element, the \"Erya\" (tr. Van Gulik 1967:25) glosses: \"\"Juefu\", good at looking.\" (貜父善顧). The \"juefu\" is also called \"jueyuan\" 玃猿, which is known as Kakuen in Japanese mythology.\n\nThe \"fulu\" 附錄 \"appendix\" to the \"Bencao gangmu\" entry for \"mihou\" \"macaque\" adds the \"jue\" 玃 \"A species of large ape or hoolock, found in Western China, and said to be six feet high, it probably denotes the great gibbon, \"Hylobates\"\", the \"northern gray gibbon, \"Hylobates muelleri funereus\"\" (viz., Müller's Bornean gibbon) (Read 1931: no. 400A); and the \"ju\" 豦 (graphically \"tiger\" and \"pig\") \"wild boar; a yellow and black monkey\" or \"jufu\" 舉父 \"lift/raise father\", the \"lion-tailed macaque, \"Macaca/Inuus silenus\"\" (Read 1931: no. 400B). The \"jue\" entry says:\nIt is a kind of old monkey. It lives in the mountains in western Sichuan. It looks like a monkey. But it is bigger and is gray and black. It can walk like a human. It robs things from humans, and looks around its surrounding from time to time. There are only male ones and no female ones, so it is also called Juefu (father monkey) or Jiajue. It may kidnap a girl and marry her to have children. The book \"Shenyi Jing\": There is a kind of animal called Zhou in the west that is as big as a donkey but looks like a monkey. It can climb trees. There are only female ones and no males. They block the road in the mountains and kidnap men who happen to pass on the road. The men are then forced to mate with then. This is the way the animal gets offspring. It is also a kind of Jue, but a female one. (tr. Luo 2003: 4124-4125, cf. Van Gulik 1967:26)\nThis all-female \"zhou\" monkey is written with a non-Unicode character, combining the 豸 radical and \"zhou\" 周 phonetic.\n\nLi Shizhen describes the \"ju(fu)\":\nIt is found in the mountains in Jianping. It is the size of a dog but looks like a monkey. It is black and yellow, and covered with a big beard and bristles. It may throw stones to strike humans. The book \"Xishan Jing\": There is a kind of animal in Chongwu Mountain. It looks like Yu but has long arms. It is good at throwing stones. It is called Jufu. (tr. Luo 2003: 4125, cf. Read 1931: no. 400B) \n\nJu 狙 originally meant \"macaque; monkey\" and came to mean \"spy; watch for\" (e.g., \"juji\" 狙擊 \"attack from ambush). The \"Shuowen jiezi\" defines \"ju\" as \"a kind of [\"jue\"] monkey, also said to mean a dog that briefly bites a person\" (玃屬一曰狙犬也暫齧人者).\n\nThe (c. 4th-3rd centuries BCE) \"Zhuangzi\" was the oldest Chinese classic to use \"ju\". For instance, it has two versions of a quote from Laozi (called Lao Dan 老聃, lit. \"old helixless-ears\") using the term \"yuanzu\" 猿狙 \"gibbon and macaque; monkey\" to exemplify someone who is not a Daoist sage. \n\"Compared to the sages,\" said Old Longears \"he would be like a clerk at his labors or a craftsman tied to his work, toiling his body and vexing his mind. Furthermore, it is the patterned pelt of the tiger and the leopard that bring forth the hunter, it is the nimbleness of the gibbon and the monkey that bring forth the trainer with his leash. Can such as these be compared with enlightened kings?\" (7, tr. Mair 1994:68, cf. 12 1994:109) \n\nThe \"Shanhaijing\" mentions two mythological animals named with \"ju\". First, the \"xieju\" 猲狙 (with \"xie\" or \"he\" \"short-muzzled dog\"): \nThere is an animal on this mountain which looks like a wolf, but it has a scarlet head and rat eyes. It makes a noise like a piglet. Its name is the snubnose-dogwolf. It eats humans. (4, tr. Birrell 1999:62-63) \nSecond, the \"zhuru\" 狙如 (with \"ru\" \"be like\"):\nThere is an animal on this mountain which looks like a white-eared rat; it has white ears and white jaws. Its name is the monkey-like. Whenever it appears, that kingdom will have a great war. (5, tr. Birrell 1999:96) \n\nXingxing 猩猩 or shengsheng 狌狌\"a monkey; orangutan\" reduplicates \"xing\", which graphically combines the \"quadruped radical\" with a \"xing\" 星 \"star\" phonetic, or with \"sheng\" 生 \"life\" in the variant \"xing\" or \"sheng\" 狌. The name is used for foreign simians in modern terminology, \"xingxing\" means \"orangutan\", \"heixingxing\" with \"hei-\" 黑 \"black\" means \"chimpanzee\", and \"daxingxing\" with \"da-\" 黑 \"large\" \"gorilla\".\n\nThe \"Erya\" says, \"The [\"xingxing\"] is small, and likes to cry.\" (猩猩小而好啼). Guo Pu's commentary (tr. Van Gulik 1967:26) notes, \"The \"Shanhaijing\" says: It has a human face and the body of a pig, and it is able to speak. At present it is found in [Jiaoji] and the [Fengxi] district (i.e. North Indo-China). The [\"xingxing\"] resembles a [\"huan\" 獾] (badger) or small pig. Its call resembles the crying of a small child.\" Fengxi 封谿 corresponds to modern Bắc Ninh Province in Vietnam.\n\nThe \"Huainanzi\" (tr. Major et al. 2010:508) says, \"The orangutan knows the past but does not know the future; the male goose knows the future but does not know the past.\"; Gao You's commentary (tr. Van Gulik 1967:26) says, \"The [\"xingxing\"] has a human face but the body of a beast, and its colour is yellow. It is fond of wine.\"\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" entry for the \"xingxing\" or \"shengsheng\", which Read (1931: no. 403) identifies as the \"orangutan, Simia satyrus\", records,\nLi Shizhen: An orangutan can talk and knows about the future. Xingxing [猩猩] means [\"xingxing\" 惺惺] \"intelligent\". The orangutan was recorded in books like \"Er Ya\" and \"Yi Zhou Shu\" several dozen times. The following explanation is a summary: It is found in the mountain valleys in the Ailaoyi area and Fengxi County in Jiaozhi. It looks like a dog or a macaque. Its yellow hair resembles that of an ape, and its white ears resemble those of a pig. Its face looks human, and its legs are similar to those of a man. It has long hair and a good-looking face and head. It cries in the same way as a baby cries, or as a dog barks. They flock together and move covertly. Ruan Qian: Local people in Fengxi catch the animal in the following way: They place some wine and straw sandals on the roadside. Orangutans will come to the spot and call out the names of the ancestors of the people who placed the things. Then they leave temporarily and come back shortly afterwards. They drink the wine and try the sandals on. While the orangutans are enjoying themselves, people catch them and then keep them in cages. When one of them is to be killed, the fattest one will be chosen. It weeps sadly. People in the Xihu area use its blood to dye a kind of woolen fabric, which will maintain its bright color for a long time. After a puncture is made in the orangutan to let out blood, the person will flog the animal and ask it for the number of beatings. The flogging will stop after one \"dou\" of blood has been collected. The book \"Li Ji\" (\"Record of Rites\") said that the orangutan could speak. The book \"Guang Zhi\" by Guo Yigong said that the orangutan could not speak. The book \"Shanhai Jing\" also said that the orangutan could speak. [Li Shizhen comments]: The orangutan is a kind of animal that looks like a human being. It looks like an ape or a monkey and can speak simple words like a parrot. It may not be the same as what Ruan Qian said. The book \"Er Ya Yi\" by Luo Yuan: In ancient books, the orangutan was described as similar to a pig, dog or monkey. But now it is recorded that the animal looks like a baboon. It looks like a naked bare-foot woman with long hair hanging from the head. They do not seem to have knees, and they travel in a group. When they encounter human beings, they cover their bodies with their hands. People say this is a kind of savage human. According to what Luo Yuan said, it seems such a creature is actually a Yenü (meaning \"wild girl\") or Yepo (meaning \"wild woman\"). Are they the same? (tr. Luo 2003: 4128, cf. Read 1931: no. 403) \n\nThe subentry for the \"yenü\" 野女 \"wild women\" or 野婆 \"wild wife\" says,\nThe book \"Bowu Zhi\" [博物志] by Tang Meng: In the Rinan area there is a kind of creature called the Yenü (meaning \"wild girl\") that travels in group. No male ones are to be found. They are white and crystal-like, wearing no clothes. The book \"Qidong Yeyu\" by Zhou Mi [周密]: Yepo (meaning \"wild woman\") is found in Nandanzhou. It has yellow hair shaped into coils. It is naked and wears no shoes. It looks like a very old woman. All of them are female and there are no male ones. They climb up and down the mountain as fast as golden monkeys. Under their waists are pieces of leather covering their bodies. When they encounter a man, they will carry him away and force him to mate. It is reported once that such a creature was killed by a strong man. It protected its waist even when it was being killed. After dissecting the animal, a piece of seal chip was found that was similar to a piece of gray jade with inscriptions on it. Li Shizhen: According to what Ruan Qian and Luo Yuan said above, it seems that this Yenü is actually an orangutan. As to the seal chip found in the animal, it is similar to the case that the testes of a male mouse are said to have seal characters [\"fuzhuan\" 符篆 \"symbolic seal script\"] on them, and the case that under the wing of a bird a seal of mirror has been found. Such things are still unclear to us. (tr. Luo 2003:4128, cf. Read 1931: no. 403A) \nThe bright scarlet dye known as \"xingxingxue\" 猩猩血 \"gibbon's blood\" was not used by the Chinese, but observed in imported Western textiles. Although the source for this tradition of the bloody dye remains untraced, Edward H. Schafer (1963:210) notes a Western analogue in \"St. John's blood\", a variety of the red dye kermes, which derives from the insect kermes. The Tang dynasty chancellor Pei Yan wrote, \nThe \"hu\" [\"barbarians\"] of the Western countries take its blood for dyeing their woolen rugs; its color is clean and will not turn black. Some say that when you prick it for its blood, if you ask, \"How much will you give me?\" the [\"xingxing\"] will say, \"Would two pints be truly enough?\" In order to add to this amount, you thrash it with a whip before asking and it will go along with an increase, so that you can obtain up to a gallon. (\"Quan Tangwen\" 全唐文, tr. Schafer 1963:209)\n\nEdward H. Schafer quotes a Tang story.\nA number of the beasts were captured and put in a pen, to be cooked for the magistrate of a Tonkinese town. They picked the fattest of their number and thrust it weeping forth, to await the magistrate's pleasure in a covered cage: \"The Commandant asked what thing this was, and the [\"xingxing\"] spoke from within the cage, and said, 'Only your servant and a jug of wine!' The Commandant laughed, and cherished it.\" Of course the clever, winebibbing animal became a treasured pet. (1963:209) \nThe Chinese belief that gibbons enjoyed drinking wine has parallels in Classical antiquity, \"monkeys were reputed to be overfond of wine, as Aristotle, Aelian, and Pliny observed, and their drunkenness made them easy to capture.\"\nChinese stories about the \"xingxing\" liking wine appealed to the Japanese. In Japanese mythology, the Shōjō 猩猩 was a god of wine with a red face and long, red hair, who was always drunk and dancing merrily. Compare the drunken monkey hypothesis that the human attraction to ethanol may have a genetic basis.\n\nFeifei 狒狒 \"monkey; baboon\" reduplicates \"fei\", written with the \"dog/quadruped radical\" 犭with a \"fu\" 弗 phonetic. Van Gulik (1967:29) says Chinese zoologists have adopted \"feifei\" as a convenient modern rendering of \"baboon\".\n\nThe \"Erya\" glosses, \"The \"feifei\" resembles a person; it has long hair hanging down on its back; it runs quickly and devours people.\" (狒狒如人被髮迅走食人). Guo Pu's commentary says,\nThis is the [\"xiaoyang\" 梟羊] \"owl-goat\". The [\"Shanhaijing\"] says: As to its shape it has a human face, with long lips; its body is black, with hair hanging down to its heels. When meeting with people it laughs. This animal occurs in N[orth] Indo-China, [Guangxi], and [Guangdong]. The large ones are over ten feet tall. Locally the animal is called [\"shandu\" 山都]. (tr. Van Gulik 1967:28) \nXiaoyang 梟羊 is a variant of the mythic \"xiaoyang\" 梟楊 \"owl-poplar\", which David Hawkes (1985:268) describes as \"an anthropoid monster whose upper lip covers his face when he laughs. His laughter was sinister, it was said, being an indication that he was about to eat human flesh.\"\n\nThe \"Shuowen Jiezi\" (Liu 2003: 4129) writes \"feifei\" 𥝋𥝋 with an obsolete pictograph, and Xu Shen says: \"People in the north call it Tulou [土螻 \"earth cricket\"]. Now people call it Renxiong [人熊 \"man bear\"].\"\n\nThe (c. 9th century) \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\" describes the \"feifei\".\nIf one drinks its blood one can see ghosts. Its strength equals ten-thousand catties. When it laughs, it curls up its upper lip which then covers its forehead. It has the shape of a macaque and it is capable of human speech, which sounds like the twitter of birds. It can foretell births and deaths. Its blood can be used as a purple dye and its hair for making wigs. An old tradition says that its feet are reversed. Hunters say it has no knees, so that when sleeping it has always to lean against some support. In the early Liu Song dynasty period (420 to 479 A.D.), Guangxi sent a pair of [\"feifei\"] as tribute. (tr. Van Gulik 1967:28) \nRegarding this widely copied \"fanzhong\" 反踵 \"reversed feet\" description, Van Gulik reasons that a copyist misread the \"ji\" 及 \"extend; down to\" in Guo Pu's 及踵 \"hair hanging down to its heels\" comment as \"fan\" 反 \"reverse; opposite\". He further (1967:29) suggests that the human face, long lips, and long red hair description of the \"feifei\" could apply to the orangutan.\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" entry for \"feifei\", identified as the \"golden snub-nosed monkey, Rhinopithecus roxellanae\" and \"baboon\" \"Papio hamadryas\" (Liu 2003: 4129), lists other synonyms of \"xiaoyang\" 梟羊 \"owl goat\", \"yeren\" 野人 \"wild man; savage\" (see Yeren), and \"shandu\" 山都 \"mountain capital\".\nChen Cangqi: The baboon is found in the Yi areas in the southwest. The book \"Er Ya\": The baboon is in the shape of a human being with disheveled hair. It runs very fast and may eat humans. The book \"Shanhai Jing\": Xiaoyang has a human-like face, long lips and a black body. It is covered with hair. It has reversed heels. It laughs when it sees a human being, and when it laughs its upper lip may cover its eyes. Guo Pu: In the Jiao and Guang regions and also in the mountains in Nankangjun, such creatures can be found. A big one may be as tall as 10 \"chi\". It is colloquially called Shandu. In one of the years of the Xiaojian reign of the Song dynasty (960-1279), people from the indigenous areas contributed a pair of baboons to the emperor, one male and one female. The emperor asked Ding Luan, a representative from the tribe, about the animal. Ding Luan answered: \"The face of the animal looks like a human being. It is covered with red hair like a macaque. It has a tail. It can talk like a human being, but it sounds like the chirping of a bird. It can predict life and death. It is very strong and can carry very heavy things. It has reversed heels and seems to have no knees. When it sleeps, it leans against something. When it catches a human being, it first laughs and then eats him. A hunter can catch the animal by using this trick. He puts one arm through a bamboo tube to lure the animal. When the animal laughs heartily, the person uses a nail to try to pin its lip to its forehead. Then the animal will run around wildly and die shortly afterwards. It has very long hair, which can be used to make wigs. Its blood can be added in the dyeing of boots or silk fabrics. If one drinks its blood, one will be able to see ghosts.\" After this explanation, the emperor ordered a painter to do a portrait of the animal. Li Shizhen: The book \"Fangyu Zhi\": The baboon can also be found in the mountains in western Sichuan and Chuzhou. It is also called Renxiong. People catch it, and eat its paws and peel off its hide. In the You Mountains of Shaxian County in Fujian, the animal is also found. It is more than 10 \"chi\" tall and laughs when it encounters a human being. It is also called Shandaren, Yeren, or Shanxiao. The book \"Nankang Ji\" by Deng Deming: Shandu looks like a wild man from Kunlun Mountain. Its body is covered with hair. When it encounters a human being, it closes its eyes and opens its mouth, seeming to laugh. It turns stones in mountain streams to find crabs for food. (tr. Luo 2003: 4129, cf. Read 1931: no. 404) \n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" supplement lists four other monkey-like creatures under \"feifei\".\n\nShandu 山都, which Read identifies as the \"chacma baboon, Cynocephalus porcarius\":\nLi Shizhen: The book \"Shuyi Ji\" [述異記] by Ren Fang: There is a kind of spirit in Nankang that is called Shandu. It looks like a human being and is just over two \"chi\" tall. It is black with red eyes and yellow hair. It makes its nest in a tree in the deep mountains. Its nest looks like bird nest over three \"chi\" tall. These nests are bright and lustrous inside, and are light and quite empty. Usually two such nests are placed together on a mattress made of bird feathers. The upper one is for the male and the lower one is for the female. Shandu may appear in different forms and can even become invisible. It is very difficult to find such a creature. It is similar to Muke and Shanxiao. (tr. Luo 2003: 4130, Read 1931: no 404A)\n\nShanhui 山𤟤: \nLi Shizhen: The book \"Beishan Jing\": Shanhui looks like a dog but has a human-like face. It is good at throwing stones. When it encounters a human being, it laughs. It runs as fast as the wind. When such a creature is sighted, there will be strong winds all over the country. (tr. Luo 2003: 4130, cf. Read 1931: no. 404B)\n\nThe \"Shanhaijing\" context describes the \"shanxiao\" 山魈 or \"shanhui\" 山𤟤.\nThere is an animal on this mountain which looks like a dog but it has a human face. It is good at throwing. When it sees a human being, it laughs. Its name is the mountain-monkey. It moves like the wind. Whenever it appears, there will be typhoons over all under the sky. (Yufa Mountain 獄法之山, tr. Birrell 1999:41) \n\nMuke 木客 \"tree guest\": \nThe book \"Nankang Ji\": It is found in the mountains in the south. Its head and face are similar to those of a human being, and it talks like a human. But its paws have sharp claws. They live among steep cliffs and bury the dead like human beings. It can change things with human beings, but it does not show itself in front of human beings. Now there is a kind of ghost market in the south where such trades take place. There is also a creature called Mukeniao (a bird), which is recorded in the \"Category of Fowls.\" (tr. Luo 2003: 4130, cf. Read 1931: no. 404C) \n\nShanxiao 山 [non-Unicode character with 犭radical and \"zao\" 喿 phonetic]: \"The one footed mythological monster. Numerous beings are described in the [\"Shanhaijing\"]. It says that people cannot see it therefore it seems utter nonsense to write so much about it.\" (tr. Read 1931: no. 404D) See the \"shanxiao\" 山魈.\n\nWei 蜼 \"a monkey\" is written with a character that combines the \"insect radical\" 虫 with a \"zhui\" 隹 phonetic. The etymology of \"wei\" < *\"wih\" or *\"ruiʔ\" (< *\"r-wiʔ\") 蜼 \"kind of monkey-like animal\" (Schuessler 2007:513) is hypothetically connected with Palaung-Wa *\"rəyol\" \"white-handed gibbon\" or the \"-i\" in \"wei\" could be a diminutive suffix added to the \"you\" < *\"wu\" 猶 \"monkey\" word.\n\nThe \"Erya\" glosses, \"The \"wei\" has an upturned nose and a long tail. It is good at climbing mountain peaks.\" (蜼卬鼻而長尾時善乘領). Guo Pu (tr. Van Gulik 1967:29) says, \"The \"wei\" resembles the macaque but is larger. Its colour is yellowish-black, its tail several feet long, resembling an otter's tail, forked at the tip. Its nostrils are tilted upward; when it rains the \"wei\" hangs from a tree and covers its nostrils with its tail, or with two fingers. The people east of the (Yangtse) River catch and raise it. It is swift and strong.\" Based on this description, Van Gulik identifies \"wei\" as the golden snub-nosed monkey (\"Rhinopithecus roxellana\"), which is \"a smaller monkey with a long tail, and a pronounced upturned nose; it has a blue-black face, and long, fluffy golden fur.\"\n\nYou 猶 \"a monkey\" has an uncertain etymology and meaning. Schuessler (2007:580) notes \"you\" < *\"ju\" < Proto-Chinese *\"wu\" 猶 \"a kind of monkey\" has comparative linguistics similarities with Proto-Tibeto-Burman *\"myuk\" or *\"mruk\" > Burmese \"myok\" and Mru \"yuk\" \"monkey\". \"You\" < *\"ju\" phonologically resembles two Old Chinese \"monkey\" words: \"yu\" < *\"ŋoh\" 禺 and \"hou\" < *\"gô\" 猴. The character猶, with the \"quadruped radical\" and a \"qiu\" 酋 phonetic, originally denoted a simian, but became a common Chinese phonetic loan character for \"you\" \"still; yet\".\n\nThe \"Erya\" glosses \"you\" as \"Like a muntjac and good at climbing trees\" (如麂善登木). Hao Yixing 郝懿行's 19th-century sub-commentary says, \"The wild animal \"you\" is a kind of monkey, shaped like a muntjac, which resembles a hornless deer with feet like a dog.\" The \"you\" is also called \"youhu\" 猶猢 and identified as the \"husun\" 猢猻.\n\nThe \"Shuowen jiezi\" defines \"you\" as \"a kind of \"jue\" \"large monkey\", \"you\" is also said to be the Longxi [modern Tianshui region] word for \"puppy\" (玃屬一曰隴西謂犬子為猷).\n\nDu 獨 (lit. \"alone\") named \"a larger monkey\", which was interpreted as a monkey with \"solitary habits\", based on the word's literal meaning (Van Gulik 1967:36). Read (1931: no. 401B) identifies it as \"a species of baboon or mandrill\".\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" \"rong\" 狨 entry notes the \"du\" 獨. \nDu looks like an ape but is bigger. It stays alone and gives a single cry at a time. It eats apes and monkeys. So there is an idiom saying that when a Du cries, all apes will disperse. The term \"dufu\" (獨夫, a lone man, or a \"dictator.\") has its origin in this animal. Some say this animal is actually the Huangyao [黄腰 \"yellow waist\"]. Also see explanations in the class of Hu (tiger). (tr. Luo 2003: 4126, cf. Read 1931: no. 401B)\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" entry for \"hu\" 虎 \"tiger\" lists \"huangyao\" among animals that are strong enough to kill and eat tigers.\n\nGuoran 果然 (lit. \"indeed; really\") or 猓然 is described as \"a timid monkey with a long tail\". Van Gulik (1967:36) tentatively associates \"guoran\" with the surili monkeys of the genus Presbytis found in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" entry for the \"Guoran\" 果然, which Read identifies as the \"proboscis monkey, \"Nasalis larvatus\"\", lists synonyms of \"Yu\" 禺, \"You\" 狖, \"Lei\" or \"Wei\" 蜼, and \"Xianhou\" 仙猴 \"transcendent monkey\".\nGuo Pu: Guoran is an animal that cries in a way as if it is calling its own name. Luo Yuan (羅願): If one of them is caught, a whole group of them will cry and attack. Even when some are being killed, others will stay by. So it is called Guoran. The term means \"assured,\" meaning when one is endangered, it can be assured that the others will come to its rescue. A big one is called Ran, or Yu. A small one is called You or Lei. People in the south call it Xianhou [仙猴]. Chen Cangqi [陳藏器]: The book \"Nanzhou Yiwu Zhi\": In the area of Jiaozhou there is a kind of animal called Guoran. It is bigger than an ape. Its body is no more than three \"chi\" long, but its tail may rise above its head when erect. Its nostrils open upward. At times of rain, it will hang itself on a tree with its tail stuffed into its nostrils. Its hair is long, soft, fine and slippery. It is white with black stripes, resembling the colored feathers of a gray duck. Its hide and fur can be made into very warm fur coats and quilts. The book \"Er Ya\" recorded an animal with \"upward nostrils and long tail,\" which is really this animal. Li Shizhen: Guoran is an animal that is kind. They are found in the mountains in the south-west. They live in trees. Guoran looks like an ape. It has a white face with black cheeks. It has a big moustache and multicolored hair. Its tail is long and forked at the tip. When it rains, Guoran stuffs the forked tips of its tail into its nostrils. They like to travel together, the aged ones in the front and the young ones at the back. When they find food, each gives the chance to others to eat first. They live together harmoniously and love each other dearly. When one is endangered, all the others will come to its rescue. As Liu Zongyuan [柳子] noted, it is an animal that is benevolent, polite, filial and kindhearted. In ancient times, the animal was painted as an image of politeness, filial piety and wisdom. However, it is an animal that is very suspicious. When they see a man coming they will climb up a tree and change positions many times. Sometimes they will run wildly, breaking their heads or legs. That is why people say that if a person is so suspicious, he can be compared to this animal. (tr. Luo 2003: 4127, cf. Read 1931: no. 402)\n\nThis \"guoran\" heading has two subheadings.\n\nMengsong 蒙頌 or Menggui 蒙貴 (see below).\n\nChanhu 獑猢, which the \"Shuowen\" writes with the \"rat radical\" 鼠 as \"zhanhu shu\" 斬𪕮鼠, is described by Li Shizhen\nIt is a kind of Guoran. It is black with a white stripe on the waist like a belt. Its hands are covered with long white hair. They are held in a manner as if clutching a piece of board. The book \"Shudi Zhi\" [蜀地志]: The Canhu looks like a monkey. It moves very fast and stays in the trees all the time, jumping from one tree to another like a bird. (tr. Luo 2003: 4127, cf. Read 1931: no. 402B) \n\nMengsong 蒙頌 or menggui 蒙貴 (lit. \"cover praise\" or \"cover expensive\") \"a dark monkey, a skillful rat-catcher\" is an obscure ancient name. Read (1931: no. 402A) suggests \"mengsong\" was the \"mongoose, \"Herpestidae mungo\"\".\n\nThe \"Erya\" succinctly defines \"mengsong\" as \"shaped like a [\"nao\"] monkey\" (蒙頌猱狀). Since the \"Erya\" dictionary, which glosses words from the Chinese classics, has the oldest textual usage of mengsong, the name presumably comes from a lost pre-Qin classic. Guo Pu's commentary gives the synonym \"menggui\" and says (tr. Read 1931: no. 402A), \"An animal like a small [\"wei\"] proboscis monkey, purple black in color, from Yunnan (交趾 \"Annam\"). They are reared as rat catchers better than cats.\" Guo says these monkeys came from present-day central Vietnam, specifically Jiuzhen 九真 and Rinan 日南, modern Khánh Hòa Province and Nghệ An Province.\n\nThe Tang author Duan Chengshi's (853) \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\" says, \"Cats are also named \"menggui\" or \"wuyuan\" 烏員 [lit. \"crow member\"].\"\n\nThe \"Bencao gangmu\" subsumes \"mengsong\" under the \"guoran\" \"monkey\" entry (tr. Luo 2003: 4127): \"Mengsong is also called Menggui. It is small Guoran. Purple and black, it is found in Jiaozhi. It is raised in houses. It catches mice even better than a cat or a leopard.\"\n\nThe simians (higher primates) include two families of Old World monkeys (\"Cercopithecidae\") and lesser apes or gibbons (\"Hylobatidae\", lit. \"wood walkers\"), listed with modern Chinese nomenclature:\n\nThe Monkey is the ninth of the twelve-year animal cycle in the \"Chinese zodiac\". The Year of the Monkey is associated with ninth Earthly Branch symbol \"shen\" 申 denoting the southwest direction and seventh lunar month. For example, one Year of the Monkey begins February 8, 2016.\n\nSeveral mythical or semi-mythical monkeys are mentioned above in the Terminology section. Early texts treat the \"juefu\" 貜父 (cf. Japanese \"kakuen\") as both a factual \"large ape found in western mountains\" and a mythological \"single-sex species that abducts and mates with humans\"; said to be either all males (viz. \"fu\" 父 \"father\") who rape women (\"Soushenji\") or all females who rape men (\"Bencao gangmu\", cf. \"xingxing\"). The early pictographs for \"nao\" 夒 \"monkey\" and \"kui\" 夔 \"a legendary demon with a human face and body of a monkey/dragon\" were nearly identical. Chinese legends say that foreign textiles used \"xingxing\" 猩猩 blood as a scarlet dye.\n\nMany Chinese mythological creatures are said to resemble monkeys or apes. For instance, the \"xiao\" 囂 is described as \"a long-armed ape\" and the \"shanxiao\" 山魈 \"mountain imp\" supposedly had a human face and a monkey's body. The lake-dwelling \"shuihouzi\" 水猴子 \"water monkey\" is said to like drowning people.\n\nBased on the data for the \"juefu\", \"xingxing\", and \"feifei\", Van Gulik concluded that,\n\nLike the Indian monkey-god Hanuman in Hindu mythology, Chinese deities sometimes appear in the guise of monkeys. The best-known of these is Sun Wukong, the main protagonist in Wu Cheng'en's picaresque novel \"Journey to the West\", also known as \"Monkey\". In the southern regions of China, many temples were built to the monkey-god who is worshipped as the \"Qitian dasheng\" 齊天大聖 \"great saint equal to heaven\", which was a name of Sun Wukong.\n\nWolfram Eberhard (2003:192) explains, \"It is not only in Indian mythology that the monkey plays a leading part; it is also found in South Chinese and in Tibetan legend. Several varieties of monkey are native to South China; and according to one Tibetan myth, the Tibetan people are descended from a monkey\", namely Pha Trelgen Changchup Sempa. \"Tales of women who have been abducted and ravished by monkeys and who have then given birth to children, are common in South China, and several Chinese 'clans' attribute their origins to such a union.\" Eberhard (1968:53) calls Yang 楊 the \"Monkey Clan\", citing the totemistic myth recorded in the \"Soushenji\" and \"Fayuan Zhulin\" that the Yangs living in southwestern Shu (state) (modern Sichuan) were descendants of monkeys. The \"Soushenji\" (12, tr. Eberhard 1968:52) \"reported that in the southwest of Shu there were monkey-like animals whose names were [\"jiaguo\" 猳國], [\"mahua\" 馬化], or [\"jueyuan\" 玃猿, see \"Jue and Juefu\"]. These animals abducted women and sent them back when they became pregnant. If the baby were not accepted, the woman would have to die. Therefore these children were raised and they received the clan name Yang. For this reason this clan occurred quite frequently in Southwest Shu.\"\n\nAccording to orally transmitted accounts collected from the Miao ethnic group of China, at first there were no people, but rather the ancestors of modern humans were monkeys. One day the monkeys went to play in a cave, where a divine dragon resided. The dragon blew upon the monkeys its divine breath, which caused them to be transformed into modern human beings. (Yang 2007:105)\n\nChinese religions use monkeys and apes as metaphors for people. In Chinese folk religion, some shape-shifting monkeys were said to be human ancestors. In Daoism, monkeys, particularly gibbons, were believed have longevity like a \"xian\" \"transcendent; immortal\". In Chinese Buddhism, on the one hand, monkeys symbolized restless and foolish humans, and on the other hand, Gautama Buddha was supposedly a benevolent monkey king in an earlier incarnation.\n\nChinese traditional folk religion regards monkeys as supernatural beings. Eberhard (1968:50) cites early reports that monkeys \"could talk\", \"knew the past\", and \"were like men\".\n\nJan Jakob Maria de Groot's classic study of Chinese religions (1908:202) distinguishes \"monkey demons\" and \"were-monkeys\", both of which could shape shift between a monkey and a human. While a monkey demon \"often acts as a dangerous devil\" (frequently transforming in order to have sex with a human), a were-monkey was usually virtuous (e.g., the monkey who takes human shape in order to become a Buddhist monk, \"Xuanshizhi\" 宣室志).\n\n\"Monkey demons\" could assume both male and female forms. De Groot (1908:603) describes them as either \"a lewd fornicator of wives and maids\" or \"a seductress, in beautiful female forms, of adults and inexperienced youths, whose senses it bewitches at the detriment of their health\". For instance, the (4th century) \"In Search of the Supernatural\" records a monkey-demon story from the era of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin.\nIn the [Taiyuan] period (376-396) of the [Jin] dynasty they kept a monkey in the back palace of [Dizhao 昭翟], prince of [Dingling], in front of the chambers of his concubines. These women once upon a time simultaneously got in the family way, and each of them gave birth to three children that danced and hopped while discharging from the bowels. [Zhao] thus being convinced that the monkey was the culprit, killed the beast and the children; which made the women burst out all at once into wailing. He interrogated them, and they avowed they had seen a young man dressed with a yellow silk robe and a white gauze cap, a most lovely personage, jesting and chatting quite like a man (tr. de Groot 1908:603-4)\nLegends about monkey-human interbreeding are common, as noted above \"Jue\" ape-men copulate with women and \"Zhou\" monkey-women copulate with men.\n\nThe \"Youyang zazu\" (tr. Eberhard 1968:51) tells a legend that the Chinese peoples were descendants of simians: \"a monkey married the female servant of a daughter of heaven and thus became ancestor of the [Ji]; another monkey also married the servant of a daughter of heaven and became founder of the [Cheng]\" – using \"Ji\" 姬 (lit. \"imperial concubine\") as \"a general term for southern peoples\" and \"Cheng\" 傖 (or \"cang\" 傖 \"coarse; vulgar\") as \"an insulting word for North Chinese who had migrated to the south\".\n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" lists ways to protect oneself from mountain demons associated with different astronomical days (chap. 17, tr. Ware 1967:288), including \"On a day \"shen\" [申 \"Monkey\"], a man calling himself a lord is a monkey [猴]; a [day \"jiuqing\" 九卿], an ape [猿].\"\n\n\"Were-monkeys\" (named in analogy with werewolf) were frequently older monkeys that transformed into humans. The (c. 1st century) \"Wu Yue Chunqiu\" (De Groot 1908:201) tells a story about King Goujian of Yue (r. 496-465 BCE) wanting to improve his army's military skill. One of his ministers suggested: \nI have recently heard about a virgin girl in [Yue] who has come from the southern forest. The people of that country praise her (martial skill). I request you to summon her, and grant her an interview at once.\" The king of [Yue] sent envoys to summon her to be questioned about the art of fighting with sword and halberd. When the virgin set out for the north for an audience with the king; she met on her way an old man. He said his name was Mr. [Yuan] and addressed her \"I have heard that you are skilled in swordsmanship, I wish you would show me!\" The girl replied \"Your handmaid would not dare to conceal anything from you. You just test me!\" Thereupon Mr. [Yuan] swept his walking staff over a cluster of bamboo trees, and (in that one sweep) laid all the twigs and branches bare. Before the falling leaves had reached the ground, however, the girl had caught them all (on her sword), Mr. [Yuan] then flew up into a tree, and changed into a white gibbon. (tr. van Gulik 1967:40) \nMr. Yuan is named Yuan Gong 袁公, a wordplay upon \"yuan\" 猿 \"gibbon; monkey\". Noting that this \"monkey-man\" called himself a member of the Yuan 袁 (\"monkey\") clan, De Groot says, \"In subsequent ages it continues a feature of monkey-myth to represent were-monkeys as persons bearing that tribal name, just as man-foxes were … often believed to be members of the Hu tribe.\"—referring to the pun between \"hu\" 狐 \"fox\" and the Hu 胡 (\"barbarian\") clan (see de Groot 1908:195).\n\"Baiyuan\" 白猨 \"white gibbons\" like \"Mr. Yuan\" were considered to be spiritually powerful. The (c. 239 BCE) \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" has a \"knack story\" about the legendary archer Yang Youji 養由基 and a \"shen baiyuan\" \"supernatural white gibbon\" that instinctively knew the intentions of humans.\nYang Youji and Yin Ru were both men of highly refined skills. In the courtyard of the palace of Chu there was a magical white ape, which even the best archers could not hit, and so the king of Chu asked Yang Youji to try. Yang Youji picked up his bow and arrows and went to try. Before shooting, he had already pinned it with his arrows; with a single shot, the ape fell. Thus, Yang Youji had the ability to hit his target before actually hitting his target. (chap. 24, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:619) \nThe (121 BCE) \"Huainanzi\" tells a simpler version of this story.\nThe king of Chu had a white ape. When the king himself shot at it, the ape grabbed his arrows to show off. He ordered Yang Youji to shoot it. When [Yang] began to draw the bow and aim the arrow, [even] before he shot, the ape hugged a tree and shrieked. This is hitting the target before hitting the target. (16, tr. Major 2010:648) \n\nDaoism, like Buddhism, paradoxically treats monkeys as both foolish and wise animals.\n\nThe (c. 4th-3rd centuries BCE) Daoist \"Zhuangzi\" illustrates the gibbon/macaque distinction (see Symbolism section). The first story is about a \"jugong\" 狙公 \"macaque/monkey trainer\".\nTo weary the spiritual intelligence by trying to unify things without knowing that they are already identical is called \"three in the morning.\" Why is this called \"three in the morning\"? Once upon a time, there was a monkey keeper who was feeding little chestnuts to his charges. \"I'll give you three in the morning and four in the evening,\" he told them. All the monkeys were angry. \"All right, then,\" said the keeper, \"I'll give you four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were happy with this arrangement. Without adversely affecting either the name or the reality of the amount that he fed them, the keeper acted in accordance with the feelings of the monkeys. He too recognized the mutual dependence of \"this\" and \" that.\" Consequently, the sage harmonizes the right and wrong of things and rests at the center of the celestial potter's wheel. This is called \"dual procession.\" (chap. 2, tr. Mair 1994:16-17) \nZhuangzi tells a \"yuan\" 猿 \"gibbon\" parable to the King of Wei.\nMaster Chuang passed by the King of Wei wearing patched clothing made of coarse cloth and shoes tied together with twine. \"How come you're so wretched, master?\" asked the King of Wei. \"It's poverty,\" said Master Chuang, \"not wretchedness. When a scholar possesses the Way and integrity but cannot put them into practice, he is wretched. When his clothing is tattered and his shoes have holes in them, he is poor, not wretched. This is called, 'not having met with the right time': Has your majesty not seen the high-climbing gibbon? When it is on a nanmu, catalpa, or camphor tree [all tall, straight trees], the gibbon grasps the branches with its hands and feet or wraps around them with its tail, moving nimbly among them. Even Yi and P'engmeng [the famous mythical archers Houyi and his disciple] would not be able to take accurate aim at it. When, however, the gibbon is on a silkworm thorn, ramosissimus, thorny limebush, or matrimony vine [all short, thorny bushes], it moves furtively and glances sideways, shaking and trembling all the while. This is not because the gibbon's sinews and bones have become stiff and lost their suppleness, but because it finds itself in an inconvenient situation and cannot show off its ability. Now, if I am situated under a benighted ruler and confused ministers, and still wish not to be wretched, how could I be so?\" (20, tr. Mair 1994:194) \n\nThe Daoist discipline of \"daoyin\" \"guide and pull\" is based on the notion that circulating and absorbing \"qi\" \"breath; life force\" in the body can lead to longevity or even immortality. Long-limbed animals were believed to be innately adept at absorbing \"qi\" and thus acquire \"occult powers, including the ability to assume human shape, and to prolong their life to several hundred years\" (van Gulik1967:38). For example, the (c. 4th century) \"Chunqiu Fanlu\" (tr. Van Gulik) says, \"The gibbon resembles the macaque, but he is larger, and his colour is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing.\"\n\nThe \"Baopuzi\" lists animals associated with longevity, including (chap. 3, tr. Luo 2003:4124, cf. Ware 1967:56), \"A macaque may evolve into an ape after 800 years. After another 500 years it evolves into Jue, and Jue will evolve into Chanchu (toad) after 1,000 years.\"\nAnother animal associated with longevity was the \"he\" 鶴 \"crane\", whose long neck and legs supposedly enabled the bird to absorb \"qi\" and live up to a thousand years. \nThe pair of \"yuanhe\" 猿鶴 \"gibbon and crane\", both of which were famous for their graceful movements, became a literary and artistic trope for a \"long life\". The (624) \"Yiwen Leiju\" encyclopedia quotes a \"Baopuzi\" story, not found in the received text, about King Mu of Zhou (r. 976-922 BCE). \"When King Mu of the [Zhou] dynasty made his expedition to the south, his entire (routed) army was transformed. The \"gentlemen\" [君子] among his troops changed into gibbons or cranes, the \"small men\" [小人] into insects or grains of sand.\" (tr. Van Gulik 1967:39), noting that this widely quoted passage \"sets up the gibbon as the gentleman among the primates – a position he has kept till the present day.\"\n\nWhen Buddhism was first transmitted into China circa the 2nd century CE, monkeys were already an ancient tradition in Buddhist texts.\n\nSutras frequently quote the Buddha to use \"monkey\" similes. The \"Dhammapada\" (334, tr. Buddharakkhita 1990:102) says: \"The craving of a person given to heedless living grows like a creeper. Like the monkey seeking fruits in the forest, he leaps from life to life (tasting the fruits of his kamma).\" The \"Samyutta Nikaya\" (12.61, tr. Bodhi 2000:595) says: \"Just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of one branch, lets that go and grabs another, then lets that go and grabs still another, so too that which is called 'mind' and 'mentality' and 'consciousness' arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night.\"\n\nSeveral of the \"Jataka tales\" describe the Buddha's past lives as a monkey or an ape (see the Four harmonious animals). For example, the \"Mahakapi Jataka\" or Great Monkey King.\nIn the heart of a Himavat there was a large tree, which bore excellent fruits even bigger than the palmyra nuts having exceedingly sweet flavor; lovely hue and fragrance, which no man had ever seen or noticed before. This tree was also the abode of several monkeys; and the Bodhisatta was born as the king of those monkeys. He was much larger in size than his followers; and was more compassionate and virtuous than others. One day, the monkey king noticed that a branch of the tree had grown just over the stream. It alarmed him, because some of the fruits might drop in the stream, which then might get carried away to the man’s world; and the men would then certainly come to have all the fruits for themselves. So, he instructed the monkeys not to let any fruit grow on that branch if they wished to enjoy the fruits for a longer period. … [However, one piece of fruit fell and floated downstream, where it came into the hands of a king who] tasted it, and then remarked, \"Nothing could surpass the flavor of this fruit\". He then ordered his men to hunt for the tree in and around the river-bank which bore the fruit. Soon the king’s men found out the tree laden with such luscious and delicious fruits. When they saw the monkeys enjoying those fruits, which their king wanted to have so eagerly, they attacked the monkeys mercilessly with volleys of arrows.\n\nWitnessing the approaching attacking royal soldiers the Bodhisatta jumped on a mountain peak, which the other monkeys were not likely to copy. There, in order to save his friends he seized a strong rooted tall cane with his legs and bending it towards the tree jumped back and caught hold of the branch of the tree. He then called upon the other monkeys to use him as a bridge to jump upon the mountain peak. Taking advantage of the situation all the monkeys jumped on the mountain and darted away quickly. The monkey king was, however, terribly bruised and injured by being trampled by his mates when acting as a bridge for them. Soon he swooned. The king watched the flight of the monkeys; and also the plight of the monkey king. He was greatly moved by the exemplification of such insight; courage; valor; and sacrifice, which an animal had just displayed to save the lives of his subjects. The king then ordered his men to delicately bring down the unconscious ape and gently place him on a couch and to render the best possible first aid. When the great monkey regained his consciousness the king asked him to explain as to why did he endangered his life to save his subjects, who were rather meant to serve or sacrifice. Like a guru, he then said, \"O King! Verily my body is broken but my mind is still sound; I uplifted only those over whom I exercised my royal powers for so long.\" And before the king could utter some words of praise for the great monkey; he found him dead. (tr. Varma 1999) \n\nChinese Buddhists adapted and expanded upon these traditional \"monkey\" metaphors for human qualities. A famous Chan Buddhist example is the Chinese \"xinyuan\" \"mind monkey\", which is a Buddhist psychological metaphor describing \"unsettled; restless; inconstant\" mentality. The word \"xinyuan\" 心猿 \"heart-/mind-monkey\" is frequently combined with \"yima\" 意馬 \"thought-/will-horse\" in the four character idiom \"xinyuan yima\" or \"yima xinyuan\", reflecting the previously mentioned association between monkeys and horses (and a major motif in the \"Journey to the West\").\n\nMonkeys are a traditional theme in Chinese literature. Besides the prominent \"Monkey King\" Sun Wukong mentioned above, gibbons and macaques are popular images in Chinese poetry. Van Gulik (1957:51) says nearly every Chinese poet who wrote from the 3rd to 7th centuries referred to the \"graceful movements of the gibbon and his saddening calls\". For instance, the Tang poet Li Bai wrote poems about gibbons 白猿 in the Qiupu 秋浦 region (in south-central modern Anhui Province).\n\nA modern example is Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee story \"The Morning of the Monkey\", published in \"The Monkey and the Tiger\".\n\nReflecting the simial likenesses among humans, monkeys, and apes, many languages symbolically use \"monkey; ape\" words in reference to people. English monkey, for instance, can mean a \"mischievous child\", \"person with minimal intelligence and/or bad looks\", or \"menial employee who does a repetitive job\"; and ape can mean \"uncivilized person\", \"wild; crazy\", or \"imitate; mimic\". Compare the Chinese words \"houzi\" 猴子 \"monkey; mischievous/glib person\", \"hour\" 猴儿 \"monkey; endearing term for a child\", and \"houjing\" 猴精 \"monkey spirit; clever and roguish person\".\n\nZhou dynasty culture symbolically contrasted the gibbon as \"gentleman; sage\" (\"junzi\" 君子 or \"sheng\" 聖) and the macaque as \"commoner; petty person\" (\"xiaoren\" 小人).\nA sharp distinction was drawn … between the superior gibbon and the inferior macaque. The macaque, frequently coming down to inhabited areas to forage, and therefore often seen and easily caught, became a familiar sight in daily life. Trained macaques formed part of the performances of travelling showmen, amusing young and old alike by their clever tricks. The gibbon, on the contrary, inhabiting as it did the upper canopy of the primeval forest, rarely seen and extremely difficult to catch, was regarded as a denizen of the inscrutable, forbidding world of the high mountains and deep valleys, peopled by fairies and goblins. Accordingly, the macaque was the symbol of human astute trickery but also of human credulity and general foolishness; and the gibbon the symbol of the world of the supernatural, mysterious and remote from man's daily life. (van Gulik 1967:37) \nSee the \"Zhuangzi\" stories (under \"Daoism\").\n\nEberhard (1968:52) describes a traditional Chinese literary motif that monkeys will sometimes seduce and impregnate women, who give birth to either a monkey-child or a monkey spirit. Thus, in the \"popular mind\", says Eberhard (1986:192), a monkey can also symbolize an adulterer.\n\nThe earliest Chinese monkey-shaped objects (Geissemann 2008:1), believed to have been belt hooks, date from the late Eastern Zhou period (4th-3rd centuries BCE) and depict a gibbon with outstretched arms and hook-shaped hands. The oldest extant painting of a monkey is attributed to the Buddhist monk and artist Guanxiu (832-912). It shows a gibbon offering peaches to a \"Luohan\" 羅漢 \"arhat\", which (Geissemann 2008:6) says \"firmly establishes this painting in a Buddhistic context\".\n\nGibbons became a popular subject for Chinese painters (for example, Yi Yuanji, fl. 1050-1075) during the Northern Song dynasty, and then again from the Southern Song dynasty into the Yuan dynasty, especially for the Chan Buddhist monk Muqi Fachang (1210?-1269?) (Geissemann 2008:6-7).\n\nMonkeys are a frequent motif in modern Chinese art. Several examples (Eberhard 2003:193) are based on a visual pun between \"hou\" 侯 \"marquis; count\" and \"hou\" 猴 \"monkey\". Since \"mashang\" 馬上 literally means \"on horseback\" or figuratively \"immediately\", an image of a monkey riding a horse is called \"mashang fenghou\"馬上封侯 \"May you immediately be conferred the rank of marquis\", which is a Chinese gift of congratulations for gaining promotion. Another visual pun showing one monkey crouching on the \"bei\" 背 \"back \" of another \"bei\" 辈 \"generation\" can be interpreted as \"May you rank as marquis from generation to generation\"; and a painting of two monkeys in a tree has the same signification.\n\nAnother frequent image is a monkey holding a peach, as in the 16th-century novel \"Fengshen Yanyi\", which refers to a legend that a monkey stole the peaches of Immortality from the garden of Xi Wangmu \"Queen Mother of the West\".\n\nThe familiar Three wise monkeys are a Japanese, rather than Chinese, pictorial maxim to \"see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\". See Monkeys in Japanese culture for more information.\n\nSimians have played a role in traditional Chinese medicine, \"which maintains that the meat, bones and livers of monkeys have various curative effects, ranging from detoxification to improving sex drive\" (Chen 2007). Chinese state-owned medicine companies buy about 2 tons of monkey bones annually, estimated as \"taken from at least 1,500 primates.\"\n\nThe (1597) \"Bencao gangmu\" lists pharmacological uses for four monkeys. The \"mihou\" \"monkey; macaque\" (Read 1931: no. 400B) is the most versatile.\nThe meat and blood of a \"rong\" 狨 \"gibbon\" (1931: no. 401B) are used for anal fistula, and the fat for scabies. Read notes \"The placenta, liver, and bile of the gibbon are used in Japanese Domestic medicine.\" The meat of a \"guoran\" 果然 monkey (Read 1931: no. 402) is prescribed for malaria and chills. The meat of a \"xingxing\" 猩猩 monkey (1931: no. 403) supposedly \"cures drowsiness and hunger, and desire for a cereal diet, it allows an exhausted man to travel well, and old age will not tell on him\". This refers to the Daoist \"bigu\" \"avoiding grains\" fasting technique associated with achieving \"xian\" \"transcendence; immortality\".\n\nMonkey meat, as mentioned above in the \"Bencao gangmu\", was traditionally considered both a medicine and a delicacy in Chinese cuisine. \n\nSeveral Chinese classics record the practice. The \"Lüshi chunqiu\" (tr. Knoblock and Reigel 2000:310) lists roast \"lips of the \"xingxing\" ape\" among the five finest meats. The \"Yiwuzhi\" (tr. Eberhard 1968:51) records a \"special soup made of monkey head was typical for southern peoples.\" The \"Huainanzi\" (19, tr. Major et al 2010:784) has a story about eating monkeys: \"A man from Chu had some boiled monkey meat that he gave to his neighbors. They thought it was dog meat and found its flavor pleasing. Later, when they heard it was monkey, they knelt down and vomited all they had eaten. This was a case of not even beginning to know about flavor.\"\n\nEating monkey brains, \"hounao\" 猴腦, is a controversial practice. Qing emperors ate monkey brains during feasts known as the Manchu Han Imperial banquet (Gayley 2017: 42). According to Stephen Chen, the son of chef Joyce Chen, Qing emperors \"were partial to scooping out the brain of a living monkey for a tasty treat, and the practice continues to this day, particularly in some southern provinces\" (2007).\n\nModern day official Chinese policy with regards to the procurement of certain monkeys for food makes their consumption illegal, with sentences of up to 10 years in prison for violators (Li 2016: 76-77, 80).\n\nMonkey Kung Fu, or \"houquan\" 猴拳 \"Monkey Fist\", refers to several Chinese martial arts techniques utilizing monkey-like movements. Modern Chinese movies have popularized the Drunken Monkey style.\n\nThe monkey is a secondary animal style, besides the basic Five Animals, or \"wuxing\" 五形 \"Five Forms\", of Tiger, Crane, Leopard, Snake, and Dragon.\n\nThe \"Huainanzi\" (7, tr. Major et al 2010:250) criticized yogic practices like the \"yuanjue\" 蝯躩 \"gibbon leap\": \"If you huff and puff, exhale and inhale, blow out the old and pull in the new, practice the Bear Hang, the Bird Stretch, the Duck Splash, the Ape Leap, the Owl Gaze, and the Tiger Stare: This is what is practiced by those who nurture the body. They are not the practices of those who polish the mind [e.g., the Perfected].\"\n\nThe history of pet monkeys in China goes back at least to the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE).\n\nThe scholar Robert van Gulik, who was a great fancier of gibbons, wrote (1967:14), \"there is only one objection to keeping a gibbon as pet, namely that one is liable to become too fond of it, and cannot bear to part after one's pet has reached maturity.\"\n\nThe \"Huainanzi\" (2, tr. Major et al 2010:107) mentions caging a gibbon, \"If you put an ape in a cage, it will be just like a pig. It is not that it is no longer clever or agile but that it has nowhere to give free rein to its ability.\" The text (16, tr. Major et al 2010:639) also mentions a beloved pet gibbon, \"The king of Chu lost his [pet] ape, and [to recapture it] he destroyed every tree in the forest.\" This was likely King Gong of Chu (r. 590-560 BCE) who is identified with a related story (16.89, tr. Major 2010:648) concerning \"The king of Chu had a white ape\" that could catch arrows shot by archers.\n\nTraditional Chinese holidays include the Monkey King Festival celebrated on the 16th day of the 8th lunar month, and the Birthday of the Monkey God, celebrated in Singapore on the 16th day of the 1st lunar month.\n\nNanwan Monkey Island is a nature reserve in Hainan, China.\n\n\"Monkey\" is also a popular name for foodstuffs including Chinese teas:\n\n\n\n"}

The operation consisted of research and information gathering about Catalan independence politicians without judicial authorization.\nThe operation allegedly included the creation or use of false evidence, data manipulation, irregular reports, secret agents, leaks to the press and the use of threats to obtain confidential information.\n\nThe operation allegedly started after the 2012 Catalan independence demonstration. The heads of the National Police started an extra-judicial operation that was kept secret even within the corps.\n\nThe operation consisted of investigating and compiling information from politicians that were favorable to the independence of Catalonia without any judicial authorization. To do this, two methods were allegedly used: a special and secret unit of the National Police Corps, depending on the Ministry of the Interior (Spain), and also through the Spanish embassy in Andorra, dependent on the spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation.\n\nOn July 6, 2016, the Ex-Commissary of the National Police Corps, José Manuel Villarejo, revealed in court that he worked with former head of the internal affairs unit, Marcelino Martín Blas, to stop the pro-independence movement. Villarejo admitted that he was in charge of \"investigating crimes\", while Martín Blas was devoted to \"appointments\", \"stories\" and \"finding sources\". \n\nHe also said that among the sources that Martín Blas had used there was the former head of the Anti-Fraud Office of Catalonia, Daniel de Alfonso, who also appeared in the recordings released earlier of the two meetings held in October 2014 with the Spanish interior minister, Jorge Fernández Díaz, in which both allegedly conspired to seek evidence against pro-independence politicians.\n\nOn July 11, 2016 a police report was made public, signed by Marcelino Martín Blas, that confirmed the existence of the Operation Catalunya and which states that one of the duties of Commissary José Villarejo \"during the last legislature was investigating \"the Catalan independence process.\"\n\nOn August 18, 2016, former president of Banca Privada d'Andorra, Higini Cierco, reported that he had received pressure from members of the Ministry of the Interior (Spain) and the heads of the national police to obtain banking information of some pro-independence politicians and their families. In particular, he assured that he had received threats and been blackmailed by Celestino Barroso, attaché from the Ministry of the Interior to the embassy of Spain in Andorra, and by Marcelino Martín Blas, Chief of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Spanish National Police .\n\nThe former lawyer of the Cierco brothers, Jaume Bartumeu, confirmed the threats and extortions of the Spanish police in the Cierco. \nOn August 22, 2016, the BPA case's Judge Canòlich Mingorance decided to notify the creation of two new causes as a result of the statements made by the Cierco brothers and sent an order to start a criminal investigation about the presumed threats and coercion exercised by the Government of Spain over the Managers of the Private Bank of Andorra to filter information that would undermine the independence process.\nOn August 30, 2016 it was announced by the investigative commission formed by the Parliament of Catalonia that the Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy participated in the operation. The president sent his head of Cabinet, Jorge Moragas, and the Secretary of State for Commerce, Jaime García-Legaz, to Andorra to get the BPA owners to hand over bank statements, violating Andorran law.\n\nOn July 18, 2017 the commission announced their intent to present a demand against the ten people under investigation for refusing to testify before the commission, all of them high ranking officials of the Spanish government. Doing so is a crime under Spanish law.\n\nAs of July 20, 2017 the investigation has reached impasse due to the blocking of any proposal in congress.\n\nThis lists people currently or previously included as part of the operation.\n"}
{"id": "41058575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41058575", "title": "Orientation camps in Hong Kong", "text": "Orientation camps in Hong Kong\n\nIn Hong Kong's universities and higher education institutions, orientation camps (), also known as “Ocamp”, are held by different student organizations in order to welcome new students before their first academic year. There are different types of orientation camps. “Big ocamps” (大O) are organized by the students' union or constituent colleges, while “small ocamp” (細O) are usually organized by faculty or departmental societies with a view to welcome students who study in the same faculty. The duration of ocamps is usually two to seven days.\n\nThe aim of organizing Ocamps is to enable freshmen in meeting new friends through getting along with a group of freshmen in the camp. Also, it aims to let freshmen understand and then adapt to the lifestyle and culture in university. It also boosts the sense of belongings of students to the university. Furthermore, some Ocamps like to spread messages to students, for example, standing up against injustice etc.\n\nThere is no accurate information about the first orientation camp in Hong Kong but the earliest ocamp recorded was in the 1970s, held by University of Hong Kong. Then other universities started organizing it following Hong Kong University.\n\nIn each group, there will be two to four group leaders, mostly voluntary senior students (Year 2 or above) and also some alumni. They are known as “Group Mother” (組媽) and “Group Father” (組爸) as their role in the groups is to take care of the freshmen, i.e. the “group sons” (組仔) and “group daughters” (組女). They also have to design and create some handy gifts to the freshmen such as bags, hand fans and bracelets, which represent their groups.\n\n\"Dem beat\" (demonstration of beat), also known as \"dem cheers\" in some universities, means shouting slogans with a certain beat or rhythm created by claps and steps. All groups (either as university houses or colleges) have their own beat. The aim of this activity is to promote team spirit and togetherness.\n\n“Campfire” is held at night in which house captains start a fire together with torches and then all participants form a circle surrounding the fire and dance with music. Some common songs are \"My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean\", \"Dschinghis Khan\" (Cantonese version) and \"Pieces of Sea Wave and Spray\". Before the activity ends, captains will share their feelings towards the camp.\n\nSituation Game, known as “Sit. Game”, in which committees of the camp first gather all participants in a venue, usually a sports centre. The committees deceive the participants by creating a situation that all group leaders have to leave the camp immediately. Group leaders sometimes cry in front of the participants to make the situation more convincing. They then ask freshmen to speak out if there is any solution towards the situation. Before the committees announce the truth, they let participant enjoy their “last moment” with their leaders. Situation Game aims to teach and encourage participants to stand out and give voice to unfairness. Besides, it consolidates the relationship in groups including participants and group leaders.\n\nStudents are required to complete different tasks set by the committee as they run around in the city in limited time. By completing each task, students can get a certain score. At the end of the day, the team getting the highest score will be crowned the champion.\n\nWater game (水戰) is a common game in orientation camp. It is the game playing with water such as playing in the beach or playing with water guns. Participants will absolutely get wet.\n\nAs a pastime after the conclusion of all planned activities in a day, “room games\" (房 Game) are often played. Room games often last overnight. Participants will follow committees' instructions and play. Usually the games involve some penalties for the losers.\n\nPopular room activities include \"First Impression\".\n\nIn recent years, orientation camp has sparked controversy owing to the games played there as criticized for ethical problems.\n\nFor example, in 2004 Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Health and Social Sciences Faculty freshmen were asked to kiss strangers on the lips, some of whom might develop a bad feeling during such an activity.\n\nBesides, games requiring close contact between the participants have been long described as being obscene and having too much intimacy. These include the “caterpillar game” as both the girls and boys in participation are required to wrap their legs around one another's waist. Another example is the ‘jumbo’ held by students at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2013, where the females were asked to lay down above the male's body.\n\nActivities of cheers have also been condemned by some mass media for the inappropriate slogans used by students, which simply aim to verbally abuse the others. For example, in 2002, in the ocamp held by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), students from Shaw College slandered girls from New Asia College with the use of chants. Some wordings were said to be even discriminating the disabled. According to a daily news article, the Chairperson of Joint Committee on New Student Orientation of CUHK, Kenneth W.Y. Leung, responded that the committee will explain the problems instead of launching a censorship as they believe the self-discipline of students.\n"}

{"id": "8071321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8071321", "title": "Racism in association football", "text": "Racism in association football\n\nRacism in association football is the abuse of players, officials, and fans because of their skin colour, nationality, or ethnicity. Some may also be targeted because of their association with an opposing team. However, there have been instances of individuals being targeted by their own fans.\n\nRacism in association football has been most studied in the European Union and Russia, although racist incidents have been reported abroad. In response to racist incidents at association football matches, in May 2013, FIFA, the international governing body of association football, announced new measures to deal with racism in the sport.\n\nIn October 2018 Antonio Rüdiger, the victim of racist abuse, stated that authorities needed to do more to deal with racism in the sport.\n\nPrior to Senegal's 2018 World Cup match against Japan, players on the Senegal team were targeted by Alan Sugar, a British businessman. Sugar tweeted, along with a picture of the Senegal team: \"I recognise some of these guys from the beach in Marbella”. The tweet reached the news in Senegal and was published in multiple newspapers. Sugar apologized after the incident, tweeting “I misjudged me [sic] earlier tweet. It was in no way intended to cause offence, and clearly my attempt at humour has backfired. I have deleted the tweet and am very sorry.” The tweet was seen as racism for comparing the Senegalese soccer players to the rest of the 1.3 billion other residents of the African continent.\n\nDuring the 20th century until 1991, South Africa had segregation policies and segregated football leagues in which the South Africans designated \"black\" race were not allowed to play in the Football Association of South Africa. During the mid-1950s attempts by mainly South African blacks to integrate the sport were stifled by FASA. In 1961 the FASA was suspended by the International Federation of Association Football for not complying with desegregation policies. During 1963 the ban was briefly lifted until it was reinstated in 1964 and remained in place for 28 years. In 1973 the South African games were held, and attempts by the South African government to keep the games segregated and the teams racially determined and confined led to the International Federation of Association Football to pull its support from the event. They were drawn in due to the promise of it being a multiracial event, but upon discovering that the teams were racially determined and the sports events themselves had segregated attendance, FIFA backed out. The South African Football Association (SAFA) was formed in December 1991 right before the end of Apartheid on South Africa, and has no racial requirements for play and entry.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Tunisia's national football team to Equatorial Guinea in the African National Cup, at least twelve attacks were reported to have occurred in the capital and the southern city of Sfax. Some of these attacks were even against darker skinned Tunisians due to their resemblance to the sub-Saharan country. This was extended to social media through posts which focused on enslaving blacks and letting them be killed by Boko Haram, a radical group.\n\nHanif Adams, the owner of Lusaka Dynamos, was subject to racist remarks due to his Indian heritage while running for president of the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ). Some individuals have been cited saying that a foreigner should not run FAZ. An individual when asked for reasoning stated that, \"For the sake of national pride and patriotism, Faz should be run by indigenous black Zambians and not Indians or Pakistanis.\" Lusaka Dynamos neglected to back down from the race and told BBC Sport, \"I am very disappointed for people bringing race issues into matters of football or any matter concerning the development of any country...\"\n\nFootball racism and violence have decreased considerably during the 1990s through appropriate legislation such as the Football Offences Act (1991) which made racist chanting unlawful. However, racist chanting has not completely disappeared and much current abuse is linked to Asians, resulting in many still feeling intimidated. Institutionalized racism plays a large part in reducing prospects for footballing recruits from Asian communities. In a study conducted by Bains and Patel, it was recorded that over 90 percent of the Asian Heritage respondents saw both institutional racism and the existence of racist supporters as being barriers to entry into the professional game. Many cases of segregation have been recorded resulting in many Asians playing in 'Asian only leagues', thus distancing themselves further from mainstream society and popular culture. Subjection to overt racist abuse from coaches, players and spectators is a primary common denominator for many Asian footballers leading to feelings of isolation and exclusion from after-training socializing and ritual young male bonding.\n\nResearchers who wrote the \"Asians Can't Play Football\" report somewhat presciently uncovered a culpable order of ignorance and thinly disguised racism that had proscribed any sustained South Asian progression in the game. Numerous problematic stereotypes still have a firm hold over the Asian identity. The standard stereotype of South Asian people is one of the submissive, naturally placid and physically frail individual. It has been stated that the Asian build is not that of a footballer and that the stereotype of \"weak Asian\" is influenced by notions of 'race' and issues of national identity. Common stereotypes list the Asian pupil as typically seen as physically frail, lacking in stamina and likely to underachieve. A 'Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) survey highlighted that there were only 10 Asian players at Premier League academies' 48 and in 2006, there were 'only four Asian players in the professional game'. These stereotypes exist because there is an under-achievement and if they subsist, 'scouts, coaches, and managers' will not visit places of high Asian population. What unites most South Asian teams is the common experience of racism and a particular racism that is parasitically exacted through football.\n\nThere were reports of targeted racial attacks against the Philippine national team while they competed at Mongkok Stadium in a friendly against Hong Kong. The event was held on 4 June 2013. Hong Kong fans reportedly called their counterparts \"slaves\", threw bottles at them and booed at the Philippine national anthem. Hong Kong lost the friendly match to the Philippines, 1–0. At the end of the game, Hong Kong fans reportedly threw debris at the Philippine team and gallery, occupied mostly by wives and children of the players.\n\nBenny Chan, spokesman of the Hong Kong Football Association, announced that the football body will release an official report to FIFA and the public after its investigation is completed. Philippine football officials are likewise waiting for the report before filing a complaint to FIFA.\n\nIn March 2014, J1 League club Urawa Red Diamonds had to play to an empty stadium; their fans had been banned following racist banners displayed in previous matches.\n\nThe Philippine Football Federation filed a complaint with GMA Network over a comment made by news anchor Arnold Clavio over controversial remarks directed at the Philippines national football team. A popular radio and television newscaster and program host of morning news show Unang Hirit, Clavio was quoted as saying that foreign-born players are not Filipinos (emphasizing the fact that they were not born in the Philippines). Clavio later retracted this statement, insisting that he had not intended to offend anyone.\n\nAnother racial incident occurred during a friendly match between the Philippines and Indonesia on 5 June 2012. A number of Indonesian fans were observed to be chanting \"Hindi kayo Pilipino!\" (\"You are not Filipinos!\") at Filipino players of non-Philippine ancestry.\n\nFederico Valverde was accused of making a racist gesture by pulling his eyes back into a slit when celebrating a goal, at the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea.\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup, South Korea was a target of racism by Mexican television hosts following South Korea's win over Germany. After Germany's defeat, the two Mexican hosts, on-air, were seen pulling their eyes back into a slit. The hosts, following the incident, were fired by Telemundo, the television network they were employed by. After the same match, Mexican soccer supporters rushed to the South Korean embassy to celebrate. The supporters were also seen pulling their eyes back. \n\nIn European association football, there is racism operating at the institutional and fan cultural levels. In England, the upper levels of authority are majority white and give jobs as coaches or other positions to other already-known white men rather than making public job postings. Stereotypes about coaches of colour, that they are more physical than intellectual, limit the accessibility of people of colour into the football industry. There are also legislative restrictions that limit the number of 'non-citizens' within a team in ⅓ of the countries in the EU, specifically targeting certain minorities. Therefore, there is 'invisible centrality of whiteness' that permeates the upper levels of the football system.\n\nThe stereotypes also apply to the players and prevent them from being treated well during matches, as seen in the racist chants heard during matches. South Asian players are considered \"static\" and \"homogenous\" while black players are considered to be \"'difficult', 'bad tempered' and 'lacking in social etiquette\" by clubs in Netherlands. Minority groups are expected to leave behind their cultural identities when joining a team and are encouraged to conform to the dominant norms perpetuated by white culture. And once the players are able to break into the system, it is difficult for them to work their way up into management or coaching. Within local areas such as Amsterdam, a sort of neighborhood nationalism develops that also contributes to this discrimination towards players of different origins.\n\nThere have been a few groups who have attempted to assuage the problem of racial discrimination in European football such as the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) who held a seminar in Amsterdam encouraging racial equality in the industry with attendees from countries across Europe. A campaign called 'Let's Kick Racism Out Of Football' was launched in 1993 in Britain to also increase awareness and facilitate dialogue about the issue.\n\nOguchi Onyewu, an American of Nigerian descent, has been punched and shouted at by racist fans while playing for Standard Liège. He has also had incidents with other players, such as Jelle Van Damme, who, according to Onyewu, repeatedly called him a \"dirty ape\" during the 2008–09 Championship playoff, even after Onyewu relayed the information to the referees. Van Damme denied the accusations following the match, and claimed that Onyewu had called him a \"dirty Flemish\". Approximately two weeks later, on 2 June 2009, it was announced by Onyewu's lawyer that he was suing Van Damme in an effort to end on-field racism in European football.\n\nZola Matumona left FC Brussels after he accused club chairman Johan Vermeersch of making racist remarks towards him during a crisis meeting at the struggling club. He is reported to have told Matumona to \"think about other things than trees and bananas\".\n\nHenri Belle moved to Croatia at the beginning of 2011, signing with Istra 1961. He drew attention to himself both by good games and through receiving racist taunts from some supporters.\n\nIn January 2005, as part of an anti-racism initiative in Ligue 1, Paris Saint-Germain's players wore all-white jerseys and the opposing Lens players wore all-black during a French league match. The move backfired after racist elements among PSG's crowd in the Kop of Boulogne sung \"Come on the whites\". The racist overtone was exacerbated by monkey chants from the Boulogne crowd whenever a Lens player touched the ball.\n\nOn November 23, 2006 in a game between Paris Saint-Germain and Haopel Tel Aviv, a police officer, as well as many players on the field were targets of racial slurs. The police officer being chanted at threw teargas into the stands and shot his gun, killing one and injuring another.\n\nOn 18 April 2007, Lyon player Milan Baroš was accused of racially abusing Rennes' Stéphane Mbia by implying that Mbia smelt. On 4 May 2007, Baroš was found guilty of the gesture, but found not guilty of racism, and was banned for three league matches.\n\nOn 17 September 2007, Libourne's Burkinabe player Boubacar Kébé was abused by fans of Bastia; he was red-carded for retaliating. In February 2008, Bastia was again at the centre of controversy when their fans unfurled a racist banner, again aimed at Kébé, which delayed the kick-off of the match by three minutes.\n\nOn 17 February 2008, Abdeslam Ouaddou of Valenciennes was racially abused by a fan from opponents Metz; Metz and the Ligue de Football Professionnel announced that they would be suing the fan in question. The match referee did not see the incident, and so booked Ouaddou for challenging the fan. Valenciennes Chairman Francis Decourrière later demanded that the match be replayed \"in front of children from Valenciennes and Metz\". Following this incident, the French Football Federation made steps to introduce harsher punishments.\n\nIn March 2008, Bastia's Frédéric Mendy claimed he had been racially abused by Grenoble fans.\n\nIn November 2013, former defender and the French national team's most-capped player, Lilian Thuram, has said white players need to show solidarity with players who receive racist abuse, saying, \"The action of not saying anything – somehow – it makes you an accomplice.\" \n\nIn 1994, Borussia Dortmund star Júlio César threatened to leave the club after he was refused admission to a local nightclub because of his being black.\n\nFC St. Pauli fans responded decisively to outbreaks of racism in the German game. With the slogan, \"Gegen rechts\" ('Against the Right'), a combination of fans and students took to the club's terraces in 1992 to protest against politically motivated racism.\n\nIn December 1992, all the teams in the German League followed the St. Pauli lead and, over one weekend, all players played in shirts displaying the slogan \"Mein Freund ist Ausländer\" (\"My friend is a Foreigner\"). The German Sports Youth's 1995 \"No Chance for Hatred\" campaign has promoted activities against racism and xenophobia on a national scale, encouraging local clubs to participate. This campaign has not spurred German football authorities into further action.\n\nIn 1996, Merkel 1996 reports that they vehemently refuse to acknowledge that racism is a major problem, and dismiss racist abuse as isolated incidents which are unrelated to the sport. Most of their measures are concerned with law and order — reducing violence at matches — but anti-racist action is very sparse.\n\nRacism in German football is much more subtle than in other parts of Europe; monkey chanting have been replaced with codes, such as the number 88, which stands for \"HH\" or \"Heil Hitler\" (\"H\" is the eighth letter of the alphabet in both German and English). Some teams, for example Hannover 96, have banned such symbols from their stadiums.\n\nIn December 2005, in a game between FC Energie Cottbus and Dynamo Dresden, Cottbus displayed a large banner with the word \"Juden\" lined with the two stars of David. The \"d\" in \"Juden\" was based on the emblem of Dynamo Dresden. No penalties on this act of antisemitism were imposed nor was the banner confiscated, though it was quite publicized in the media.\n\nOn 25 March 2006, in a match between Sachsen Leipzig and Hallescher FC, Leipzig's Nigerian midfielder Adebowale Ogungbure was spat at and called a \"nigger\" and \"ape\" by opposition fans, who later aimed monkey noises at him. In retaliation he placed two fingers above his mouth in reference to Hitler's mustache and performed a Nazi salute. Ogungbure was arrested by German police, as it is illegal to make Nazi gestures for political or abusive purposes, but criminal proceedings were dropped 24 hours later.\n\nIn April 2006, in a match between St. Pauli and Chemnitzer FC, visiting Chemnitz fans stormed Turkish-owned stores chanting \"Sieg Heil\" and waving imitation Nazi flags. Some shouted, \"We're going to build a subway from St Pauli to Auschwitz.\"\n\nGhana-born German international striker Gerald Asamoah has frequently been the target of racist abuse. On 10 September 2006, Hansa Rostock were investigated for racist abuse in a friendly game and were subsequently found guilty; the team was fined $25,000.\n\nOn 19 August 2007, it was announced that Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller would be investigated by the German Football Association (DFB) after apparently calling Asamoah a \"black pig\".\n\nOn 4 February 2007, a racist German football fan was apprehended by fellow fans during a match between Energie Cottbus and VfL Bochum, and faces a lifetime ban. Racist chants in Cottbus are said to be commonplace.\n\nTorsten Ziegner was given a five-match ban in October 2008 for racially abusing Nigerian player Kingsley Onuegbu during a match against Eintracht Braunschweig.\n\nOn 22 July 2018, Mesut Özil (of Turkish origin) announced his retirement from the German national team, citing racism. He Tweeted In his statement posted on Twitter, Ozil wrote: \"In the eyes of Grindel and his supporters, I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose.\" The incident followed controversy in the German media following his photo with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nBlack footballers playing in the Serie A top flight in 1992–93 were also racially abused. Two black Dutch players, Ruud Gullit and Aron Winter, have spoken out against such racist taunts. Their complaints spurred a day of action on 13 December 1992, with the slogan \"No al razzimo!\" (\"No to racism\") being paraded by all players in the two Italian divisions.\n\nPaul Ince also complained about open abuse during his spell with Inter Milan in Italy between 1995 and 1997.\n\nOn 27 November 2005, Marco Zoro attempted to stop the Messina–Inter match by leaving the field with the ball after being tormented by racist taunts from some Inter supporters. He was eventually convinced to keep playing by other players, notably by Inter's Adriano. These facts then brought strong and unanimous condemnations by the whole football community within Italy, and a five-minute delay for an anti-racism display for all the matches to be played in the next week in the country. The actions of the Inter supporters were also brought to the attention of the European football governing body UEFA and the EU.\n\nIn April 2009, Inter's Mario Balotelli, an Italian footballer of Ghanaian descent, was subjected to racial abuse from Juventus fans. They were handed a one-game home fan ban as a result. At UEFA Euro 2012 playing for Italy, he fell victim to monkey chants during a match against Spain. After his move from Milan to Liverpool in August 2014, he was the target of more than 8,000 abusive posts on social media between that time, and by March 2015, more than 4,000 of these posts were racist in nature.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, then-Milan midfielder Kevin Prince-Boateng, as well as the remainder of his Milan teammates, walked off the pitch early in a friendly match against lower league side Pro Patria after enduring racial abuse from fans of the latter.\n\nOn 11 May 2014, bananas were thrown at Milan's Kévin Constant and Nigel de Jong, both black, by Atalanta fans during their Milan's 2–1 defeat. Atalanta were later fined €40,000.\n\nOn 12 June 2015, Croatian National Soccer Team supporters marked a swastika on the soccer pitch prior to their match against the Italian National Soccer Team. As a punishment, The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) ordered a £70,000 fine to the Croatians. On top of the fine, the Croatian team was forced to play their next two home matches in an empty stadium.\n\nOn 24 March 2007, in a match between France and Lithuania, a banner was unfurled by Lithuanian supporters that depicted a map of Africa, painted with the French flag colors (blue, white and red), with a slogan of \"We Support French Diversity\".\n\nIn a match between Rangers and Zeta, Rangers players DaMarcus Beasley (an African American) and Jean-Claude Darcheville (a black Frenchman) were subjected to racist abuse by Zeta players and Zeta were later fined £9,000.\n\nIn a 1991 interview, Heerenveen manager Fritz Korbach racially abused two black players, calling Bryan Roy \"a short fucking negro\" and Romário \"that coffee bean of PSV\"). During UEFA Euro 1996, the Afro-Surinamese Dutch player Edgar Davids was sent home after publicly alleging discrimination within the team's organization.\n\nIn 2004, a Dutch match between ADO Den Haag and PSV was abandoned after 80 minutes due to racist chanting from some members of the crowd.\n\nIn November 2011, Guyon Fernandez received a six-game ban for hitting opposition player Rens van Eijden. Fernandez claimed he was reacting to racist abuse from Van Eijden.\n\nIn one case, young player Caleb Francis was severely abused in his debut match for Kongsvinger IL. The abuse halted and nearly broke his career, but he returned to Kongsvinger's senior team after two years, and had a long career.\n\nSeveral other players have experienced racism, often while playing national or club matches abroad. These players include Daniel Braaten and Pa Modou Kah.\n\nTop-tier club Vålerenga Fotball famously played their with the slogan \"Vålerenga Against Racism\" instead of a shirt sponsor in the 1997 season. An official campaign, initiated by the footballers' trade union, is called \"Give Racism the Red Card\".\n\nAccording to The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, football stadiums in Poland are a recruiting ground for extremist organisations. Until a few years ago, neo-fascist symbols were a common sight there.\n\nDuring the Extraordinary Congress of the International Football Federation (FIFA), held in Buenos Aires from 6–7 July 2001, the problem of racism in Polish football was discussed and Polish national football association was called to join the struggle against racism. The problem of anti-Semitism in Polish football has drawn international criticism. Poland was named as one of the worst offenders, in British Member of Parliament John Mann report, which describes anti-Semitic incidents in 18 countries across Europe. It was noted that Polish fans routinely call each other \"Jews\" as a term of abuse. In April 2008, ŁKS Łódź player Arkadiusz Mysona wore a shirt which said \"Śmierć żydzewskiej kurwie\" (\"Death to Widzew-Jewish Whore\", which is word play used by the LKS Łódź supporters, who call fans of their local rivals \"Jews\") after a match in the Polish Ekstraklasa. Mysona said afterwards that the shirt was given to him by a fan and he hadn´t checked it.\n\nSupporters of the football club KS Cracovia, from Kraków, often refer to themselves as \"Jews\" in a positive manner, much in the same way as fans of Ajax in the Netherlands. In a manner similar to Ajax, the self-identification is related to the team's history; quite a few of the founders of both clubs from Łódź were Polish Jews.\n\nThe BBC Panorama program toured football matches in Poland before UEFA Euro 2012, jointly held in Poland and Ukraine. The journalists recorded \"a chorus of anti-Semitic chanting\" and witnessed \"black football players enduring monkey chants from the terraces\".\n\nIn 2015, Portuguese player Renato Sanches suffered monkey chants from Rio Ave supporters while leaving the pitch in a match of Rio Ave against Benfica. Although the player jokingly responded to the chants by clapping and making a monkey pose.\n\nThe publicized display of portraits of Romania's World War II leader and convicted war criminal Ion Antonescu and racist slogans by football hooligans during Liga I's 2005–2006 season prompted UEFA intervention (\"see Racism Breaks the Game\").\n\nCameroonian player André Bikey suffered racist abuse while playing for Lokomotiv Moscow.\n\nBrazilian footballer Antonio Geder of Saturn Moscow was received with monkey chants at Petrovsky Stadium in a match against Zenit Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn March 2008, black players of French side Marseille, including André Ayew, Ronald Zubar and Charles Kaboré, were targeted by fans of Zenit Saint Petersburg; Zenit fans were later warned by police in Manchester not to repeat their behaviour ahead of the 2008 UEFA Cup Final. Later on, Zenit coach Dick Advocaat revealed the club's supporters were racist. When they attempted to sign Mathieu Valbuena, a Frenchman, many fans asked \"Is he a negro?\" Additionally, Serge Branco, who played for Krylia Sovetov Samara, accused Zenit's staff of racism: \"Each time I play in St Petersburg I have to listen to racist insults from the stands. Zenit bosses do not do anything about it which makes me think they are racists too.\"\n\nOn 20 August 2010, Peter Odemwingie, a Russian-born Nigerian international, joined English Premier League team West Bromwich Albion. Shortly after signing, photographs showed Lokomotiv Moscow fans celebrating the sale of Odemwingie through the use of racist banners targeted at the player. One banner included the image of a banana and read \"Thanks West Brom\".\n\nOn 12 February 2011, Roberto Carlos signed a contract with Russian Premier League club Anzhi Makhachkala. In March, during a game away at Zenit Saint Petersburg, a banana was held near the player by one of the fans as the footballer was taking part in a flag-raising ceremony. In June, in a match away at Krylia Sovetov Samara, Roberto Carlos received a pass from the goalkeeper and was about to pass it when a banana was thrown onto the pitch, landing nearby. The 38-year-old Brazilian picked it up and threw it by the sidelines, walking off the field before the final whistle and raising two fingers at the stands, indicating this was the second such incident since March.\n\nIn December 2012, Zenit fans published a manifesto demanding that the club exclude all non-white and homosexual players from the club's roster. The demands were refused by the club, which released a statement saying that \"the team's policy is aimed at development and integration into the world soccer community, and holds no archaic views\". Until the summer of 2012, Zenit was the only team in the Russian top flight never to have signed a minority player.\n\nIn October 2013, Manchester City midfielder Yaya Touré received racist abuse from opposition fans whilst playing against CSKA Moscow in Russia. The club's stadium was partially closed as punishment. Touré suggest that black players might boycott the 2018 FIFA World Cup, to be held in Russia, if racism continued in the country.\n\nIn September 2014, Dynamo Moscow defender Christopher Samba was racially abused playing in the Moscow derby against Torpedo Moscow. As a result, Torpedo were forced to close part of their stadium, although Samba was also banned for two games for swearing at the racist fans.\n\nIn a friendly match (Russia vrs France), at Saint Petersburg on April 17, 2018, monkey chants were directed at members of the French team. The noises were picked up by television cameras and reported by photographers at the side of the pitch. As a result, \"disciplinary actions have been opened against the Russian Football Union (RFU) for this incident,” a FIFA statement read.\n\nIn October 2006, 37 Borac Čačak fans were arrested and eight faced criminal charges after racially abusing the club's Zimbabwean player Mike Temwanjera during a first division match. Borac Čačak was at the centre of more controversy in March 2008 when a Ghanaian player, Solomon Opoku, was attacked by fans; six fans were later arrested, with four being later charged.\n\nOn 29 November 2006, Hajduk Kula coach Nebojša Vučićević racially insulted Red Star Belgrade's Senegalese defender Ibrahima Gueye. The coach responded to the accusation: \"I told my players several times to put pressure on the black guy, I don't see anything wrong with that.\"\n\nDuring a match against England's under-21 side, an unnamed Serbian under-21 player was accused of racially abusing the black English defender Justin Hoyte, while the Serbian fans were alleged to have racially abused England's Nigerian-born full-back Nedum Onuoha.\n\nFollowing racist abuse from Montenegrin club Zeta fans, DaMarcus Beasley, during his stint with Scottish side Rangers, recalled previous instances of racism whilst playing away in Belgrade from fans of Red Star. Red Star, however, has been defended by some of its black players, such as Segundo Castillo and Franklin Salas, with Castillo saying that, \"Red Star fans are not racist.\" Rangers boss Walter Smith stated he had not heard the abuse, having been absorbed in the game.\n\nIn 2017, a group of fans at a game between FK Rad and Partizan Belgrade held up a racist banner and directed monkey sounds towards Everton Luiz, a Brazilian player. Efforts to stop the taunts failed and the opposing team joined in the racist actions, leaving Luiz in tears.\n\nOn 4 April 2007, football supporters from Slovan Bratislava displayed a banner which contained the words \"Alles Gute Adi\" and a smiley-head face of Adolf Hitler during a match against Senec; racist chants were also heard. Three days later, on 7 April, Slovan Bratislava fans were responsible for directing monkey chants at Artmedia Bratislava's Karim Guédé.\n\nAston Villa's Dalian Atkinson returned from Spain after one season with Real Sociedad, unhappy with the reception he received and identifying racial abuse as a major factor in his rapid departure from the Spanish club.\n\nIvorian midfielder Félix Dja Ettien suffered racial abuse when he first signed for Levante (where he stayed from 1997 to 2008); he was ignored by the coach due to his inability to speak Spanish and whenever he fell ill, he was accused of having malaria or AIDS.\n\nDuring a training session in 2004, a Spanish TV crew filmed Spanish national team head coach Luis Aragonés trying to motivate José Antonio Reyes by making offensive and racist references to Reyes' then-teammate at Arsenal, Thierry Henry. The phrase used was \"Demuestra que eres mejor que ese negro de mierda\", translated as \"Show that you're better than that black shit\". The incident caused uproar in the British media, with calls for Aragonés to be sacked. When Spain played England in a friendly match at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium soon after, on 17 November 2004, the atmosphere was hostile. Whenever black England players touched the ball, a significant proportion of the Spanish crowd began to make monkey chants, in particular to Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole. Additionally, when England sang their national anthem before kick-off, Spanish fans also racially chanted against English players. Aragonés' remarks were widely blamed by the British press for inciting the incident. After an investigation into the events during the match, UEFA fined the Royal Spanish Football Federation 100,000 CHF (US$87,000) and warned that any future incidents would be punished more severely. The incident even drew reactions from then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair and Sports Minister Richard Caborn, with the latter making the claim that the behaviour of Spanish fans was 20 or 30 years behind that of their British counterparts. UEFA noted that possible punishments could include suspension from major international tournaments or the closure of Spain home international matches to supporters. On 7 February 2007, Aragonés won an appeal over the offence, with the misdemeanour being downgraded to \"conduct which could be considered to be racist\".\n\nIn February 2005, Samuel Eto'o received racially driven verbal abuse from some Real Zaragoza spectators during a match for Barcelona. The fans began making monkey-like chants whenever Eto'o had possession of the ball and peanuts were hurled onto the pitch. Eto'o threatened to leave the pitch in the middle of the game, but was prevented by the intervention of his teammates and the referee, who rushed to the pitch to calm him down. His black teammate Ronaldinho, who has suffered similar abuses but less intensely, said he was fed-up with the sounds and that if Eto'o had left the pitch, he would have done the same. As Barcelona won 4–1, Eto'o danced like a monkey, saying rival fans were treating him as a monkey. Referee Fernando Carmona Méndez did not mention the incidents in his match report, commenting only that the behaviour of the crowd was \"normal\". The fans were identified to police by fellow spectators and they were fined and banned from attending sporting events for five months. Eto'o declared in the aftermath that the punishment was insufficient and that La Romareda, Real Zaragoza's stadium, should have been closed for at least one year. However, Eto'o's coach, Frank Rijkaard, told him to concentrate on football and to stop talking about the incident. Eto'o has stated that he does not take his children to football matches due the prevalent racism and has also suggested that players walk off if they become victims of racism.\n\nMany other African footballers have also been victims of racial abuse, such as the Cameroonian Carlos Kameni, who was abused while playing for Espanyol against Atlético Madrid, who were fined €6,000.\n\nIn January 2009, the Royal Spanish Football Federation fined Real Madrid approximately US$3,900 after a group of fans made fascist gestures and chanted fascist slogans at a match. Match referee Alfonso Pérez Burrull cited \"extremist or radical symbolism\", and chants making reference to \"the gas chamber.\"\n\nOn 27 April 2014, Barcelona player Dani Alves was targeted by Villarreal fans, who threw a banana at him. Alves picked up the banana, peeled it, and took a bite. Teammate and also Brazilian player Neymar's response, to post a photograph of himself on social media also eating a banana, went viral. Other footballers have also since taken photographs of themselves eating bananas. Cyrille Regis, who had been racially abused while a player in the 1970s and '80s, expressed concern that the viral campaign would detract from the important issues of combating racism in the game. Alves said that whoever threw the banana at him should be publicly shamed, and on 30 April 2014, a man was arrested in connection with the incident. Villarreal were later fined €12,000 for the incident.\n\nIn early May 2014, Levante's Papakouli Diop complained of receiving racist abuse from opposition Atlético Madrid fans.\n\nIn 2009, fans of Swedish football team IFK Göteborg abused supporters of rivals Malmö FF by referring to them as \"Rosengårdstattare\" (\"Rosengård gypsies\"), in a racist reference to the large immigrant population of Malmö. Also, fans of Helsingborgs IF have been known to yell monkey chants at opposing dark-skinned players.\n\nThe Swedish National Team, in the Summer of 2018 posted a Youtube video of player Jimmy Durmaz making a statement against racism in soccer. Durmaz is Assyrian, but was born and raised in Sweden. Durmaz stated that, online, he had been called \"darkie, bloody Arab, terrorist, Taliban.\" In the video, Durmaz talks about his family and how they have also been targets of racism. In the End Durmaz says \"vi är eniga, vi är sverige, knulla rasism\" Which translates to \"We are United, We are Sweden, Fuck Racism\" \n\nFwayo Tembo left Basel after he accused club coach Thorsten Fink of making racist remarks towards him during a training session. Fink is reported to have told a collaborator to \"get the monkey down from the tree\".\n\nThe Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), the Football Supporters Association (FSA) and the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) have all launched initiatives in a bid to encourage more people from ethnic minorities to attend matches.\n\nArthur Wharton, born in Gold Coast (today's Ghana), was the world's first black professional footballer. He played as a goalkeeper for Darlington. Wharton was considered the first black professional footballer although he was pre-dated by Andrew Watson, a Scottish amateur footballer. Other early non-white footballers include Walter Tull and Hong Y Soo.\n\nDark-skinned Everton centre-forward Dixie Dean recalled how racist comments were aimed at him as he left the pitch at half time during a match in London in the 1930s. Dean reportedly punched the offender before disappearing into the players' tunnel. The authorities took no action against Dean, and a nearby police officer was alleged to have informed the victim that he had \"deserved\" his punishment.\n\nSteve Mokone, a black South African who later was signed for, but never played for Barcelona, left Coventry City after his manager allegedly said to him, \"We brought you over here and you are not satisfied. That's the trouble with you people\"; Mokone interpreted this as being racist, and he swiftly signed for Dutch side Heracles Almelo.\n\nThe player Roger Verdi, who is of Indian origin, changed his name from Rajinder Singh Birdi due to racism.\n\nIn the 1960s, West Ham United players Clyde Best, who is black and from Bermuda, and Ade Coker were subjected to \"monkey chants\" and had bananas thrown at them during West Ham's games. Best had blamed this on the influence of the National Front on the football terraces.\n\nIn the 1980s, racism in football in England was rampant. Paul Canoville was abused by his own fans when he warmed up for Chelsea before making his debut. Garth Crooks was regularly subject to racist chants and banners from opposing fans during his time at Spurs. Cyrille Regis endured monkey chants from Newcastle United fans on his away début for West Bromwich Albion and was later sent a bullet in the mail following his call-up to the England squad. In 1987 John Barnes was pictured back-heeling a banana off the pitch during a match for Liverpool against Everton, whose fans chanted \"Everton are white\".\n\nAston Villa striker Stan Collymore accused Liverpool defender Steve Harkness of racist abuse during a match at Villa Park in April 1998.

He also left his job as a columnist for \"The Guardian\" \"by mutual agreement\" as a result of the comment.\n\nIn 2004, Millwall became the first club to be charged by The Football Association over racist behaviour by their fans. The charges related to abuse aimed at Liverpool player Djimi Traoré.\nOn 13 January 2007, The FA charged Newcastle player Emre Belözoğlu with \"using racially-aggravated abusive and/or insulting words\", referring to an incident during the 3–0 defeat by Everton at Goodison Park on 30 December 2006. Belözoğlu was, on 16 February 2007, accused of more racist behaviour, this time against Bolton Wanderers' El Hadji Diouf. However, on 1 March 2007, it was revealed that Diouf would not be pursuing his claim.

On 19 March he was cleared of the charges relating to the Everton game.\n\nIn 2004, during a friendly match with Spain, English fans chanted racist comments towards the Spanish team and fans. This incident was widely condemned by the British government. This incident, although not a new manifestation, brought greater awareness in England to the problem of racism in sports.\n\nOn 6 March 2007, it was announced that the Metropolitan Police were investigating apparent anti-Semitic chants by West Ham fans before the match with Tottenham Hotspur two days previously after a video of the offence surfaced on the Internet.\n\nOn 7 April 2007, in a match between Rotherham United and Gillingham, Gillingham keeper Kelvin Jack was racially abused by a Rotherham fan. On 13 April 2007, the fan was banned for life from the club.\n\nFollowing his appointment as manager in September 2007, Israeli Avram Grant has been the subject of anti-Semitic taunts from some Chelsea fans; Grant's father was a Polish survivor of the German Nazi Holocaust; Grant has also received death threats and anti-Semitic post.\n\nIn November 2008, Middlesbrough's Egyptian forward Mido was subjected to Islamophobic chanting from a small number of Newcastle fans. Mido had been subjected to similar chants the previous year, again from Newcastle fans and also in 2007 by Southampton fans and West Ham fans who had referred to Mido as a \"shoe bomber\" in reference to his likeness to Richard Reid, the British terrorist jailed in 2003.\n\nDuring a League Cup match between Blackpool and Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on 22 September 2009, Blackpool player Jason Euell, who at the time was sat on the substitutes bench was racially abused by a Stoke fan, who was ejected from the stadium and subsequently arrested by Staffordshire Police before being released pending inquiries. Euell confronted the supporter that was taunting him. Blackpool manager Ian Holloway, who had to restrain Euell, was furious in his post-match interview, saying:\n\nWe are human beings and Jason is a footballer. The colour of his skin shouldn't matter. It was disgusting. The stewards believed what Jason said, got the bloke out and I hope he is banned for life. [He is] an absolute disgrace of a human being. I thought those days had gone. Jason was just sat in the dugout at the time. I saw his reaction and I had to calm him down. It's absolutely disgraceful.\n\nEuell, who received an official apology from Stoke City, later said:\n\nIt did hurt. I felt I had to stand up for all colours and creeds and show that we won't accept it. I'm proud that I made a stand. It was a shock to hear what came out of the guy's mouth. Racism in football is not dead and buried but it's still a shock to hear that kind of thing in close proximity. There were people near the idiot who didn't agree with it, but there were others who turned a blind eye, which was disappointing.\n\nIn the wake of the incident, Spurs manager Harry Redknapp called for fans who racially abuse players to be imprisoned: \"That is disgusting – there's no place for that in the game. Surely we can't have that sort of behaviour now? Anyone who does it should be put in prison – not banned from football. Stick them where they belong, in the nut-house. It's wrong.\"\n\nIn April 2011, an initiative was launched by comedian David Baddiel to tackle anti-semitism in the sport, which was backed by players including Frank Lampard, Ledley King and Kieran Gibbs.\n\nIn April 2011, two followers of Chesterfield were arrested before the start of a game against Torquay United after racially abusing a young black Torquay player who was taking part in the pre-match entertainment. Offenders Trevor Laughton and Joanne Worrall were subsequently banned from watching football or from approaching the venue of any Chesterfield matches for three years.\n\nOn 15 October 2011, Liverpool's Luis Suárez was accused of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra, and The FA opened up an investigation into the incident. On 16 November, The FA announced they would be charging Suárez, while Liverpool announced support for their player. On 20 December, The FA concluded a seven-day hearing, eventually fining Suárez £40,000 and banning him for eight matches for racially abusing Evra. Suárez had used the word \"negrito\" towards Evra, meaning \"little black man\" in Spanish. Suárez claimed that he meant the term to be taken as it is purportedly used in South America, as a term of endearment, but this explanation was not accepted by The FA.\n\nOn 23 October 2011, in a match between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea, QPR's Anton Ferdinand alleged racial abuse by Chelsea captain John Terry, claiming Terry called him a \"fucking black cunt\" during the game, a claim denied by Terry. On 1 November, the Metropolitan Police announced a formal investigation into the allegations. In January 2012, Ferdinand received death threats and a bullet was sent to him through the post. On 1 February 2012 at Westminster Magistrates Court, Terry was accused of a racially aggravated public order offence in relation to the game at Loftus Road on 23 October. He entered a not-guilty plea and stood trial on 9 July. On 13 July, after a four-day trial, Terry was acquitted. In July, following the court hearing, Terry was charged by The FA with \"using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Ferdinand and which included a reference to colour and/or race contrary to FA Rule E3[2]\". In September 2012, after a four-day hearing, he was found guilty, banned for four games and fined £220,000.\nEvidence in his defence at Terry's trial had been given by his teammate Ashley Cole. Ferdinand's brother Rio later referred to Cole via Twitter as a \"choc ice\", meaning someone who is black on the outside but white on the inside. In August 2012, The FA found this to be a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race and fined Ferdinand £45,000.\n\nOn 29 May 2012, the BBC reported that Swindon Town had conceded, in a response to a solicitor's letter from Jonathan Tehoue, that manager Paolo Di Canio, a self-described fascist, had made an inappropriate remark to the player which Tehoue deemed to be racist. Before this news had broken, Swindon's chairman had been quoted as being entirely supportive of Di Canio and had denied that the manager had racially insulted Tehoue. In October 2013, six supporters of Charlton Athletic were sent to prison having been found guilty of racially aggravated fear of violence. The supporters had been on a train returning from a game against Fulham singing songs glorifying Gary Dobson, the racially motivated murderer of Stephen Lawrence.\n\nIn March 2014, Wolverhampton Wanderers players Carl Ikeme and George Elokobi stated they were racially abused by opposition fans while playing away at Walsall. No action was taken against the club.\n\nIn August 2014, Malky Mackay and Iain Moody were accused of sending each other racist, sexist and homophobic text messages. Moody left his job as sporting director of Crystal Palace as a result. Mackay apologised for the texts. The League Manager's Association defended Mackay, claiming that the texts were merely \"banter\"; the LMA had to later apologise for this as well. Mackay later denied being racist, sexist or homophobic.\nIn September 2014, Liverpool player Mario Balotelli was subjected to racist abuse on Twitter following his tweet mocking Manchester United. Balotelli had tweeted \"Man Utd... LOL'\", following their 5–3 defeat to Leicester City. Also in September 2014, Port Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite considered appointing Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink as manager, but decided against it partly because he believed that a racist minority of the club's supporters would make appointing a black manager a poor idea.\n\nIn February 2015, Chelsea fans were involved in an incident in which they pushed a black passenger off a Métro carriage at Richelieu-Drouot station in Paris before a Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain. The supporters were heard chanting: \"We're racist, we're racist, and that's the way we like it.\" Afterwards, Chelsea released a statement condemning the actions, and vowed to ban those involved. The incident prompted criticism from the football world. The FA condemned the incident, and backed Chelsea to take action. UEFA said they were \"appalled\" by the incident. FIFA President Sepp Blatter tweeted \"there is no place for racism in football\". Chelsea later suspended three people from attending Chelsea games pending further investigation.\nIn December 2017, at Prenton Park in an UEFA Youth League, Liverpool's Rhian Brewster was racially abused during the game.\nA North West Counties League game between Congleton Town and Padiham in October 2018 was abandoned in the second-half by the referee after the Padiham goalkeeper received racial abuse.\n\n\"Date indicates when the incident occurred, rather than when an outcome was reached.\"\n\nAndrew Watson was the first black football player to represent Scotland. Watson never turned professional, however, so Arthur Wharton is sometimes reported as being the first black British footballer.\n\nThe book \"Race, Sport and British Society\" says there was racist abuse of Celtic player Paul Wilson by Rangers fans in the 1970s: \"Rangers fans repeatedly bayed 'Wilson's a Paki' when Celtic played Rangers.\" There have been reports that some Rangers fans used to sing \"I'd rather be a darkie than a Tim\", with \"Tim\" referring to a Celtic fan. The book \"Sport and National Identity In the Post-War World\" states, \"black players in Scotland were greeted with bananas thrown from the crowd and a barrage of 'monkey grunts', notably Mark Walters of Rangers and Paul Elliott of Celtic.\" On 2 January 1988, Rangers winger Mark Walters made his debut in the Old Firm derby match at Celtic Park. Rangers lost 2–0 and Walters was subjected to racist abuse from opposing Celtic fans, who were caught on camera chanting like monkeys, throwing fruit (mostly bananas), onto the pitch and dressing in monkey costumes. It was reported that Rangers fans used \"implicit racism\" on the same day by singing \"I'd rather be a darkie than a Tim\". Although Celtic denounced the perpetrators, the Scottish Football Association (SFA) remained silent. According to Walters, he experienced worse racial abuse in Edinburgh against Hearts. Following racist abuse aimed at Walters, Rangers banned some of their own season ticket holders. Andrew Smith from \"The Scotsman\" newspaper stated, \"It is depressing to think that enforcement as much as enlightenment might account for Walters being the only black footballer in this country to have had bananas thrown at them.\"\n\nRangers captain Lorenzo Amoruso issued a public apology after a match in December 1999 for making racist comments against Borussia Dortmund's Nigerian striker Victor Ikpeba. In March 2003, Rangers fans were accused of racially abusing Bobo Baldé and Mohammed Sylla. Rangers Chairman John McClelland stated that, \"There was such a crescendo during Saturday's match although I thought I heard noises of this kind I can't be 100% sure.\" In May 2004, Marvin Andrews condemned racism from some Rangers fans.\n\nIn November 2004, then-manager of Celtic Martin O'Neill suggested Neil Lennon was the subject of chants of a \"racial and sectarian manner\".\n\nDuring a 2007 Scottish Cup tie, St Johnstone player Jason Scotland was the target of racist taunts by a handful of Motherwell fans. The offenders were promptly reprimanded by the spectators around them and were reported to police and match stewards. Motherwell Chairman John Boyle later issued an apology on behalf of the club. Motherwell were to court further controversy on 3 September 2007 when Laryea Kingston of Hearts was abused, although Motherwell refuted the claims.\n\nIn October 2009, Rangers player Maurice Edu said he was racially abused by some Rangers fans while leaving Ibrox after a UEFA Champions League defeat by Romanian club Unirea Urziceni. Edu wrote on Twitter, \"Not sure what hurt more: result or being racially abused by couple of our own fans as I'm getting in my car.\"\n\nThree Scottish judges ruled in June 2009 that \"The Famine Song\" is racist because it targets people of Irish origin. George Peat, president of the SFA, has suggested that the song causes embarrassment for Scottish football and should be stamped out. Peat has also stated that the SFA is determined to contribute to the eradication of offensive songs from Scottish football. In November 2008, a Rangers fan was found guilty of a breach of the peace (aggravated by religious and racial prejudice) for singing \"The Famine Song\" during a game against Kilmarnock. It was widely reported after an Old Firm game in February 2009, Rangers fans had sung \"The Famine Song\" at Celtic Park. \"The Famine Song\" was also sung in March 2011 at a Scottish football game by Rangers fans, nevertheless, Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill described the match as a \"great advert for Scottish football\".\n\n\"The Herald\" journalist Doug Gillon has written that \"the sectarian intolerance which divides Scottish society [...] is rooted in anti-Irish racism\".\n\nIn February 2011, in an Old Firm match at Celtic Park, a Celtic supporter was caught mocking black Rangers player El Hadji Diouf with monkey noises and gestures as he was about to take a corner kick.\n\nIn April 2011, then-manager of Celtic Neil Lennon received an explosive device in the post. Brian McNally described this as due to \"anti-Catholic and anti-Irish racism\". A number of high-profile Celtic fans also were sent suspected explosive devices. Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party Annabel Goldie MSP described bullets sent to Neil Lennon and a number of Celtic players as \"racism and sectarianism\". After an attempted assault on Neil Lennon at Hearts' Tynecastle Stadium, a motion against anti-Irish racism was lodged in the Scottish Parliament.\n\nIn October 2014, Celtic player Aleksandar Tonev received a seven-match ban for racially abusing an opponent.\n\nIn November 2018 Dennon Lewis spoke out about the racist abuse he has received from his club's (Falkirk's) own fans.\n\nOn 15 April 2012, Fenerbahçe's Emre Belözoğlu was accused of making racist comments on the pitch towards Trabzonspor's Didier Zokora. After the match, Zokora told Lig TV: \nLip-reading professionals say Belözoğlu has said the words \"fucking nigger\". Emre received a two-game ban for his actions after it was concluded that he had used abusive, but not racist, language by the authorities. There are still questions about the low ban he received.\n\nOn 12 May 2013, before the match between Fenerbahçe and Galatasaray, Galatasaray striker Didier Drogba, along with his Ivorian international teammate Emmanuel Eboué, were racially abused by certain Fenerbahçe fans during the pre-match warmups. They were allegedly shown bananas. Television cameras and some pictures clearly captured a fan waving around a banana. Though there were no monkey chants or gestures of that sort, the \"banana\" caused a huge controversy and Fenerbahce has been condemned. This is the second ever known racism incident in Turkey, again involving Fenerbahçe following the events that took place between Belözoğlu and Zokora in 2012.\n\nA scandal took place during the 2018 World Cup qualifiers surrounding the match between Syria and Iran. The match was held in Kuala Lumpur during Monsoon season, making the match much more difficult and ending in a 0-0 tie. Iran then accused Syria of 'fixing' the game to prevent Iran from advancing to the World Cup. This event shows the underlying racial tension between Syria and Iran and exemplifies how racial discrimination works its way into the sport.\n\nRacist incidents date back to at least the 1970s, such as when Arab-Israeli player Jimmy Turk joined Hapoel Tel Aviv. Turk was subjected to anti-Arab abuse during nearly every game he played. According to Itzik Shanan, director of communications at the New Israel Fund, among most racist fans are supporters of Beitar Jerusalem, also Hapoel Tel Aviv fans have been using slogans promoting a Holocaust against Maccabi Tel Aviv. Israeli right-wing football supporters taunt Arab players during games, especially those who play for the mixed Arab-Jewish team Bnei Sakhnin. Ronny Rosenthal, playing for Israel's Maccabi Haifa in 1989, was subjected to anti-Semitic taunts.\n\nUnder Israeli law, football fans can be prosecuted for incitement of racial hatred. The \"New Voices from the Stadium\" program, run by the New Israel Fund (NIF) amasses a \"racism index\" that is reported to the media on a weekly basis, and teams have been fined and punished for the conduct of their fans. According to Steve Rothman, the NIF San Francisco director, \"Things have definitely improved, particularly in sensitizing people to the existence of racism in Israeli society.\" In 2006, Israel joined Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE), a network set up to counter racism in football.\n\nAt a 1994 match in Melbourne between the Croatian community supported Melbourne Knights and the Greek community supported South Melbourne, many ethnic slurs were exchanged between the two sets of supporters.\n\nIn the first day of the Apertura 2006 tournament, fans of Santos Laguna made guttural sounds imitating a chimpanzee against the Panamanian player Felipe Baloy of Monterrey as he scored a goal. During the game, Santos Laguna's fans had also chanted other racial slurs towards Baloy, including \"chango\" (\"monkey\") and \"come platano\" (\"banana eater\"). The disciplinary commission of the Mexican Football Federation sanctioned the Santos club to a sum equivalent of 5,600 days of league minimum wage for the racist insults.\n\nThe racism went past the field in 2014 when Mexican politician, Carlos Trevino, called Brazilian football legend Ronaldinho an ape after he signed with a team in the Mexican league. He was quoted saying \"I detest it all the more because people obstruct and flood the main avenues, causing me to spend two hours getting home … and all to see AN APE … A Brazilian, but an ape nonetheless. This has become a ridiculous circus.\" These outbursts were the reason why the Brazilian legend left the Mexican league after only one season.\n\nOvert displays of racism at U.S. soccer matches are extremely rare compared to the EU and Russia, in part, because the fan base of soccer in the U.S. is ethnically diverse and much younger. However, during a 24 May 2008 Major League Soccer (MLS) game between the Columbus Crew and the New England Revolution, Revolution forward Kheli Dube (originally from Zimbabwe) scored a goal against the Crew in the 89th minute of the game. An unidentified fan in the audience shouted out a racist slur. The incident was subsequently posted to the video sharing website YouTube, and MLS promised an investigation. In response to the epithet, Revolution player Shalrie Joseph reportedly made an obscene gesture towards the offending fan. Assuming that MLS could have identified the fan, Commisoner Don Garber promised to ban him.\n\nIn July 2013, two former (caucasian) coaches of MLS side Chivas USA filled a discrimination suit against the team. In this suit, they claimed that Chivas had become a racist squad after ridding themselves of most non-Mexican players and coaching staff following several unsuccessful seasons. After the allegations were presented to a wider audience on HBO's \"Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\", MLS released a statement saying, \"MLS has zero tolerance for discrimination or prejudice of any kind... And although allegations in this lawsuit raise serious issues it would not be appropriate for us to say anything more while the litigation is ongoing.\" Nothing significant happened following the accusations.\n\nOn 14 April 2005, the Quilmes player Leandro Desabato was arrested for racially abusing Grafite, a black Brazilian player. He was held for 40 hours, but no charges were brought against him after Grafite decided not to press charges.\n\nDamien Perez of Arsenal de Sarandi labelled his opponent Jerry Bengston a \"negro de mierda\", roughly translated to \"negro piece of shit\". This is a common racial slur in Latin America. One Argentinian player, Alberto Raimundi even felt it was appropriate to use the slur when describing an opponent during a post-game interview.\n\nRacism in Brazilian football was discussed by the media in the run-up to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, held in the country.\n\nIn September 2014, Grêmio were banned from competing in the Copa do Brasil after some of their fans were seen racially abusing an opposition player.\n\nEmilio Renteria, of Venezuelan descent was forced off the field crying due to extreme racial abuse during a game played in the Chilean league. After scoring a goal against the opposing team, Renteria celebrated on the side of the pitch. After this the crowd began to chant numerous racist slurs forcing him to leave the game. Chilean senator later apologized to Renteria and made a joint effort to grow awareness for the problem in Chile.\n\nIn the 2006 World Cup held in Germany, The Ecuadorian team was the target of racism by a German commentator. The commentator was said to have commented on the color of the Ecuadorians dark skin. After this statement, the commentator continued, saying that the Ecuadorians were not real Ecuadorians, and were from Nigeria. His comments started an uproar in Ecuador over national identity.\n\nJhoel Herrera a player for Real Garcilaso of the Peruvian first division brought family to his opponent's home stadium to celebrate mother's day. Herrera endured 90 minutes of racist verbal abuse from the opposing fans and players while the ref seemed to not react. At the end of the game, Herrera's mother was caught on tape being physically abused by the racist opposing team's fans.\n\n\n"}

Goldstein admitted that he planned to destroy the center and plead guilty to conspiracy to violate civil rights, conspiracy to damage religious property, and possession of unlicensed destructive devices. He was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in Federal prison.\n\nAhmed Bedier, a spokesman for the Council for American-Islamic Relations who worshipped at the Pinellas County mosque, alleged double standards in the treatment of Goldstein and argued that Goldstein should have been prosecuted as a terrorist, but prosecutors said the facts of the case didn't warrant such a charge. \"I'm happy he's behind bars and will serve some time, but it's nowhere enough for the damage he intended to do,\" Bedier said.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "3869251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3869251", "title": "Santa Monica Farmers Market crash", "text": "Santa Monica Farmers Market crash\n\nOn the afternoon of July 16, 2003, George Weller, then age 86, drove his 1992 Buick LeSabre westbound down Arizona Avenue in Santa Monica, California toward the city's popular Third Street Promenade. The last few blocks of the street, before it ends at the ocean, had been closed to vehicle traffic for the biweekly farmers' market.\n\nWeller's car struck a 2003 Mercedes-Benz S430 sedan that had stopped to allow pedestrians through a crosswalk, then accelerated around a road closure sign, crashed through wooden sawhorses, and plowed through the busy marketplace crowd, traveling nearly at speeds between . The entire sequence of collisions took at least 10 seconds.\n\nBy the time the car came to a halt, ten people had been killed and 63 were injured. Weller told investigators he had accidentally placed his foot on the accelerator pedal instead of the brake, then tried to brake but could not stop. Days after the crash, Weller issued a statement saying he was distraught and heartbroken, and his attorney called it an accident.\n\nThe crash fueled a national debate in the United States on safety risks posed by elderly drivers.\n\nSome observers questioned Weller's account; numerous witnesses and victims reported:\n\nWeller's supporters argue that:\n\nAfter he was found guilty of ten counts of vehicular manslaughter, the sentencing judge noted that Weller \"showed enormous indifference\" and \"unbelievable callousness.\"\n\nThis case became the inspiration for the South Park Season 7 episode \"Grey Dawn\".\n\nThe day of the tragedy in Santa Monica, footage of a previous crash Weller had been in ten years earlier surfaced. While that crash was not fatal, he had driven his car off the road in much the same fashion as the Promenade crash and the footage was nearly identical in that it showed a confused Weller wandering around his crashed car in a heavily populated, public area. This further sparked debate surrounding what warning signs authorities should examine when dealing with driving privileges and the elderly.\n\nOn July 24, 2003, it was reported that state officials revoked Weller's driver's license.\n\nOn January 5, 2004, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office charged George Russell Weller with ten counts of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, carrying a penalty of up to 18 years in prison. Weller's attorneys were ordered to surrender their client within 24 hours.\n\nOn January 6, 2004, Weller pleaded not guilty to the charges before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Paula Adele Mabrey and was released on his own recognizance.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, victims and relatives filed suit against the City of Santa Monica and Bayside District Corp., organizers of the Santa Monica farmers' market, alleging that the crash could have been prevented by the installation of metal barriers. Attorney Geoff Wells, representing victims and their relatives, remarked that \"[The defendants] failed to take any reasonable steps to provide protection for the patrons at the farmer's market.\"\n\nOn October 25, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Katherine Mader convened a preliminary hearing to determine whether Weller would stand trial.\n\nOn November 3, 2004, Weller was ordered to stand trial, and his arraignment was scheduled for November 17.\n\nOn December 8, 2004, after a delay due to poor health, Weller was arraigned, again pleaded not guilty to the charges, and waived his right to a speedy trial.\n\nOn March 18, 2005, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Neill denied a motion by Weller's attorneys to dismiss the manslaughter charges, remarking that \"hitting the accelerator instead of the brake seems to me to be a clearly negligent act.\"\n\nOn October 20, 2006, by a unanimous verdict, jurors found Weller guilty on all charges, convicting him of vehicular manslaughter for killing 10 pedestrians. The sentence was to be decided by the Court, with a maximum penalty of 18 years.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, Weller received probation on all counts after a judge determined that Weller was too ill to go to prison, where he would likely be a burden on prison authorities and taxpayers. Weller was a month short of his 90th birthday. He was also ordered to pay more than $100,000 in fines and restitution to the victims' families.\n\nOn May 22, 2008, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that the City of Santa Monica had thus far paid out $21 million to settle dozens of civil lawsuits stemming from the case. The same article also noted that Weller, age 91, was now confined to his home and receiving 24-hour nursing care.\n\nOn December 9, 2010, George Russell Weller died at age 94, a mere two days after his 94th birthday.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4521071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4521071", "title": "Socrates Cafe", "text": "Socrates Cafe\n\nSocrates Café are gatherings around the world where people from different backgrounds get together and exchange philosophical perspectives based on their experiences, using the version of the Socratic Method developed by founder Christopher Phillips. The groups model their discussions from the book of the same name by Christopher Phillips and a guide he also developed. Today, there are hundreds of such gatherings, coordinated by volunteers, worldwide.\n\nSocrates Cafés began in 1996, when Christopher Phillips, then a freelance writer and editorial consultant, desired to in some way build on the legacy of historical thinkers. He proposed Socratic dialogues with anyone who wished to become more empathetic, and more objectively critical and creative philosophical inquirers. Phillips' idea of having open-invitation meetings at cafes and other public places and spaces was inspired by Matthew Lipman, the founder of the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children who advocated introducing philosophy into schools and under whom Phillips studied, as well as by Marc Sautet, whose Café Philosophique Phillips became aware of after reading an article about Sautet in 1995. According to Phillips, his version of the Socratic Method was inspired not only by the Greek interrogative elements practiced by Socrates of the \"elenctic\" (Greek for 'cross examination,' 'encounter,' 'inquiry'), \"aporia\" (Greek for 'doubt') and \"maieutic\" (Greek for 'midwifery,' in this case giving birth to ideas one harbors from within), but by the philosopher Justus Buchler's notions of human judgment and query, by philosopher Walter Kaufmann's notion of the \"Socratic type\" and view that the Socratic Method boils down to the sustained consideration of objections and alternatives to any given way of seeing things, as well as by Hannah Arendt's notion of the Socratic persona and performativity. A typical Socrates Cafe group meets in a public place, is open to anyone who wishes to attend, and Socratically explores a question which is chosen by vote or which is announced shortly in advance. Typically there are no prerequisites, and no reading or other preparation is required. \n\nJanet Sisson, a philosophy professor at Mount Royal College, has questioned the appropriateness of identifying the methods and goals practiced by Phillips with those of the historical Socrates: \"...the background for this enterprise [Socrates Café] is very different from that for the conversations of Socrates. Plato uses the figure of Socrates as a way of introducing the idea of intellectual discussion in order to promote the pursuit of truth, not as a path for personal discovery. ...To treat opportunities for dialogue as a means of self-discovery is a modern attitude, not the aim of Socrates own original dialectic. American scholars have sometimes encouraged this reading of Socratic endeavors; Phillips' fondness for this line of argument perhaps owes more to idealist or existentialist thinking than to Socrates himself.\" Sisson goes on to stress that \"(t)his does not undermine the aim of Phillips' cafes...\"\n\nPhilosopher Thomas Morris has praised the Socrates Cafe concept of good discussion about important topics by common people. David Blacker, professor of Philosophy of Education and Legal Studies at the University of Delaware, writes in \"Democratic Education Stretched Thin: How Complexity Challenges a Liberal Ideal (2007),\" that \"one can...only applaud the efforts initiated by Christopher Phillips... In very much an extra-academic (but not anti-academic) spirit, Phillips has inspired individuals to create in their own communities voluntary groups who convene to discuss philosophical questions they themselves have chosen.\" \"(p. 146)\" Blacker considers the Socrates cafe endeavor to be a critical effort for evolving a democracy, the essential function and mission of which to him is for its citizens \"to think for themselves about the lives they want to lead\" (p. 146).\n\n\n"}

Spain conquered the land now known as Colombia in the 16th century. Thus, its immigration is the most important to Colombia, whose official language is Spanish and its culture derived in great part from that of Spain.\n\nThe Spanish arrived in Colombia in 1499 to conquer the land. They built several settlements in territories of the Chibcha Confederation and placed a new order of the territory according to the interests of each group conqueror. This ordinance responded to resources that were in the settlements, a process which is generally not taken into account the views of the people who lived there. These establishments continued for the next three centuries with an expansion and colonial warrior, besides introducing a large number of black African population as slave labor, progress on indigenous peoples and palenqueros that newspapers were subject to displacement.\nIn 1499 the Spanish explorer Alonso de Ojeda arrived on the coast of northern Colombia (Cabo de la Vela). In 1501 Rodrigo de Bastidas crossed the coast between Cartagena de Indias and La Guajira and Magdalena River discovered. In 1510 Alonso de Ojeda founded San Sebastián de Urabá, the first Spanish settlement on the mainland, but that same year its provisional ruler, Francisco Pizarro, decided to leave and moved to a site in the Gulf of Urabá and founded under the direction of Martín Fernández de Enciso to Santa María la Antigua del Darién. This city, the capital of the first Spanish governor in the Castilla del Oro, was in turn abandoned in 1517. With Santa Marta (1525) and Cartagena (1533), established the Spanish control of the coast. The conquistador Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada entered a vast area in the central region of Cundinamarca and Boyacá, conquering the powerful Chibcha culture, founding the city of Santa Fe de Bogota, Tunja ordering founding Gonzalo Suarez Rendon and naming the New Kingdom of Granada region.\n\nTo establish a civil government in New Granada created a Real Audiencia in Santa Fe de Bogota in 1548-1549. The Royal Court was a body that combined executive and judicial authority until the establishment of a presidency or governorship in 1564 assuming executive powers. Until 1550 the territory of Colombia was formed by the governors of Santa Marta and Cartagena, which were subject to the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, and Popayan that was subject to the viceroyalty of Peru. The jurisdiction of the Real Audiencia de Santa Fe de Bogotá include these governorates since 1550 and was extended in time over the surrounding provinces that were forming around the country corresponding to the New Granada.\n\nIn 1717 Santa Fe de Bogotá would become the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, although suspended in 1724 due to financial problems, was reinstated in 1740 and continued until the loss of Spanish power over the territories in the 1810s.\n\nThe paisas have been considered an isolated population, and therefore different. They are mostly of Spanish descent, because Spanish men who settled in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries were accompanied by their wives. The mountains isolated the population until the late 19th century, when entered in Antioquia industrial revolution.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, thousands of Spaniards fled from Spain to Colombia. Over the course of General Francisco Franco's dictatorship many thousands more fled in fear of the regime. The Spanish republicans fled Franco's regime as well, seeking to escape retribution from the new government.\n"}

There is no \"golden age\" in the American children's rights movement.\n\nThe history of youth rights in the United States ranges from the earliest years of European settlements on North America. Poor children were routinely and legally indentured in colonial New England by the \"poor laws.\" In 1676 Nathan Knight, an eight-year-old boy, was apprenticed to a mason, \"bound... to serve and abide the full space and term of twelve years and five months.\" Provided food, shelter and clothes in exchange for his labor, the boy was not allowed to leave his master until he was 21 years old.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, American children worked in large numbers in mines, glass factories, textiles, agriculture, canneries, home industries, and as newsboys, messengers, bootblacks and peddlers.\n\nBefore the 1930s children were routinely exploited in a variety of settings throughout American society. Frequently beginning their working lives before their tenth birthday, children worked in hazardous jobs at mines, mills, factories, sweatshops, and on farms, with little or no wages. Labor laws did not exist, and the common perception of the ease with which children were manipulated made them targets for a variety of rights violations.\n\nIn the 1980s the United States provided global leadership by acting as the \"Tip of The Spear\" among nations in crafting the Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC. After the United Nations adopted the CRC in 1989, the United States became a signatory nation in 1994. However, to date the country has refused to ratify the Convention, joining only one other nation in the world with that status. Among the reasons the United States has failed to ratify the Convention is the fact that the Convention clearly states that anyone under the age of 18 is a child. The U.S. government has reservations about how that would affect matters when a 16- or 17-year-old commits a crime; currently, in certain instances, such a person can be tried as an adult in the U.S. courts. Several politicians have said that many of the declarations included in the document are not issues for which the federal government is in charge. There is currently no apparent effort within the federal government to adopt the CRC.\n\nModern children's rights issues in the United States include child labor laws, including many agricultural settings where young people between the ages of 14 and 18 routinely work full time jobs and receive half of the minimum wage. Another common issue is child custody. Laws that make it extremely difficult for non-custodial parents to spend quality time with their children. After two hearings in Congress, children's rights during treatment became a focus.\n\nToday, the American Academy of Pediatrics advocates for children's rights to appropriate medical care, and states that in cases of \"an imminent threat to a child's life,\" physicians in some cases may provide treatments to children, even if these treatments are opposed by the parents because of their religious beliefs.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44740", "title": "Turkic peoples", "text": "Turkic peoples\n\nThe Turkic peoples are a collection of ethno-linguistic groups of Central, Eastern, Northern and Western Asia as well as parts of Europe and North Africa. They speak related languages belonging to the Turkic language family. They share, to varying degrees, certain cultural traits, common ancestry and historical backgrounds. In time, different Turkic groups came in contact with other ethnicities, absorbing them, leaving some Turkic groups more diverse than the others. Many vastly differing ethnic groups have throughout history become part of the Turkic peoples through language shift, acculturation, intermixing, adoption and religious conversion. In their genetic compositions, therefore, most Turkic groups differ significantly in origins from one group to the next. Despite this, many do share, to varying degrees, non-linguistic characteristics, including certain cultural traits, some ancestry from a common gene pool, and historical experiences. The most notable modern Turkic-speaking ethnic groups include Turkish people, Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Turkmen and Kyrgyz people. \n\nThe first known mention of the term \"Turk\" (Old Turkic: 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰 \"Türük\" or 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰:𐰜𐰇𐰛 \"Kök Türük\" , Old Tibetan: duruggu/durgu (meaning \"origin\"), Pinyin: Tūjué, Middle Chinese (Guangyun): ) applied to a Turkic group was in reference to the Göktürks in the 6th century. A letter by Ishbara Qaghan to Emperor Wen of Sui in 585 described him as \"the Great Turk Khan.\" The Orhun inscriptions (735 CE) use the terms \"Turk\" and \"Turuk\".\n\nPrevious use of similar terms are of unknown significance, although some strongly feel that they are evidence of the historical continuity of the term and the people as a linguistic unit since early times. This includes Chinese records Spring and Autumn Annals referring to a neighbouring people as Beidi.\nDuring the first century CE, Pomponius Mela refers to the \"Turcae\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \"Tyrcae\" among the people of the same area. There are references to certain groups in antiquity whose names could be the original form of \"Türk/Türük\" such as \"Togarma\", \"Turukha\"/\"Turuška\", \"Turukku\" and so on. But the information gap is so substantial that we cannot firmly connect these ancient people to the modern Turks. Turkologist András Róna-Tas posits that the term \"Turk\" could be rooted in the East Iranian Saka language or in Turkic. However, it is generally accepted that the term \"Türk\" is ultimately derived from the Old-Turkic migration-term 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰 \"Türük\"/\"Törük\", which means \"created\", \"born\", or \"strong\", from the Old Turkic word root \"*türi-\"/\"töri-\" (\"tribal root, (mythic) ancestry; take shape, to be born, be created, arise, spring up\") and conjugated with Old Turkic suffix 𐰰 (\"-ik\"), perhaps from Proto-Turkic \"*türi-k\" (\"lineage, ancestry\"), from the Proto-Turkic word root \"*töŕ\" (\"foundation, root; origin, ancestors\"), possibly from a Proto-Altaic source \"*t`ŏ̀ŕe\" (\"law, regulation\"). This etymological concept is also related to Old Turkic word stems 'tür' (\"root, ancestry, race, kind of, sort of\"), 'türi-' (\"to bring together, to collect\"), 'törü' (\"law, custom\") and 'töz' (\"substance\").\n\nThe earliest Turkic-speaking peoples identifiable in Chinese sources are the Dingling, Gekun (Jiankun), and Xinli, located in South Siberia. The Chinese Book of Zhou (7th century) presents an etymology of the name \"Turk\" as derived from \"helmet\", explaining that this name comes from the shape of a mountain where they worked in the Altai Mountains. According to Persian tradition, as reported by 11th-century ethnographer Mahmud of Kashgar and various other traditional Islamic scholars and historians, the name \"Turk\" stems from \"Tur\", one of the sons of Japheth (see Turan).\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, various Turkic peoples of the Eurasian steppe were subsumed under the identity of the \"Scythians\". Between 400 CE and the 16th century, Byzantine sources use the name Σκύθαι (\"Skuthai\") in reference to twelve different Turkic peoples.\n\nIn the modern Turkish language as used in the Republic of Turkey, a distinction is made between \"Turks\" and the \"Turkic peoples\" in loosely speaking: the term \"Türk\" corresponds specifically to the \"Turkish-speaking\" people (in this context, \"Turkish-speaking\" is considered the same as \"Turkic-speaking\"), while the term \"Türki\" refers generally to the people of modern \"Turkic Republics\" (\"Türki Cumhuriyetler\" or \"Türk Cumhuriyetleri\"). However, the proper usage of the term is based on the linguistic classification in order to avoid any political sense. In short, the term \"Türki\" can be used for \"Türk\" or vice versa.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the first Turkic people lived in a region extending from Central Asia to Siberia, with the majority of them living in China. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE. The earliest separate Turkic peoples appeared on the peripheries of the late Xiongnu confederation about 200 BCE (contemporaneous with the Chinese Han Dynasty). Turkic people may be related to the Xiongnu, Dingling and Tiele people. According to the \"Book of Wei\", the Tiele people were the remnants of the Chidi (赤狄), the red Di people competing with the Jin in the Spring and Autumn period. Turkic tribes such as the Khazars and Pechenegs probably lived as nomads for many years before establishing the Turkic Khaganate or \"Göktürk Empire\" in the 6th century. These were herdsmen and nobles who were searching for new pastures and wealth. The first mention of Turks was in a Chinese text that mentioned trade between Turk tribes and the Sogdians along the Silk Road. The first recorded use of \"Turk\" as a political name appears as a 6th-century reference to the word pronounced in Modern Chinese as \"Tujue\". The Ashina clan migrated from Li-jien (modern Zhelai Zhai) to the Juan Juan seeking inclusion in their confederacy and protection from the prevalent dynasty. The tribe were famed metalsmiths and were granted land near a mountain quarry which looked like a helmet, from which they were said to have gotten their name 突厥 (\"tūjué\"). A century later their power had increased such that they conquered the Juan Juan and established the Gök Empire.\n\nTurkic peoples originally used their own alphabets, like Orkhon and Yenisey runiforms, and later the Uyghur alphabet. Traditional national and cultural symbols of the Turkic peoples include wolves in Turkic mythology and tradition; as well as the color blue, iron, and fire. Turquoise blue (the word \"turquoise\" comes from the French word meaning \"Turkish\") is the color of the stone turquoise still used in jewelry and as a protection against the evil eye.\n\nIt has often been suggested that the Xiongnu, mentioned in Han Dynasty records, were Proto-Turkic speakers. Although little is known for certain about the Xiongnu language(s), it seems likely that at least a considerable part of Xiongnu tribes spoke a Turkic language. However, some scholars see a possible connection with the Iranian-speaking Sakas. Some scholars believe they were probably a confederation of various ethnic and linguistic groups. Genetics research in 2003 on skeletons from 2000 year old Xiongnu necropolis in Mongolia found some individuals with DNA sequences also present in some modern-day Turks, suggesting that a Turkish component had emerged in the Xiongnu tribe at the end of the Xiongnu period.\n\nIn 2009, archaeologists found Turkic balbals which are 2000 years old.<ref name=\"http://www.tika.gov.tr/en/news/tika_supports_archaeological_digs_in_kazakhstan-19322\"></ref>\n\nAccording to another archeological and genetic study in 2010, the DNA found in three skeletons in 2000-year-old elite Xiongnu cemetery in Northeast Asia belonged to C3, D4 and R1a. The evidence of paternal R1a supports the Kurgan hypothesis for the Indo-European expansion from the Volga steppe region. The R1a was found in Xiongnu people and the present-day people of Central Asia. Analysis of skeletal remains from sites attributed to the Xiongnu provides an identification of dolichocephalic Mongoloid, ethnically distinct from neighboring populations in present-day Mongolia.\n\nXiongnu writing, older than Turkic, is agreed to have the earliest known Turkic alphabet, the Orkhon script. This has been argued recently using the only extant possibly Xiongu writings, the rock art of the Yinshan and Helan Mountains. It dates from the 9th millennium BCE to the 19th century, and consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and few painted images. Excavations done during 1924–1925 in Noin-Ula kurgans located in the Selenga River in the northern Mongolian hills north of Ulaanbaatar produced objects with over 20 carved characters, which were either identical or very similar to the runic letters of the Turkic Orkhon script discovered in the Orkhon Valley.\n\nThe Hun hordes ruled by Attila, who invaded and conquered much of Europe in the 5th century, might have been Turkic and descendants of the Xiongnu. Some scholars regard the Huns as one of the earlier Turkic tribes, while others view them as Proto-Mongolian in origin. Linguistic studies by Otto Maenchen-Helfen and others have suggested that the language used by the Huns in Europe was too little documented to be classified, but may have been an Indo-European language. Nevertheless, many of the proper names used by Huns appear to be Turkic in origin. In the first half of the first millennium, mass-migrations to distant places were common, geographical borders were fluid and cultural identity was more likely to change dramatically during the lifetime of an individual, relative to the modern era. These factors also made it more likely that the Huns were, initially at least, closely related to the Turkic peoples.\n\nIn the 6th century, 400 years after the collapse of northern Xiongnu power in Inner Asia, the Göktürks assumed leadership of the Turkic peoples. Formerly in the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, the Göktürks inherited their traditions and administrative experience. From 552 to 745, Göktürk leadership united the nomadic Turkic tribes into the Göktürk Empire on Mongolia and Cental Asia. The name derives from \"gok\", \"blue\" or \"celestial\". Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the Göktürk Khanate had its temporary \"khans\" from the Ashina clan who were \"subordinate\" to a sovereign authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs. The Khanate retained elements of its original shamanistic religion, Tengriism, although it received missionaries of Buddhist monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The Göktürks were the first Turkic people to write Old Turkic in a runic script, the Orkhon script. The Khanate was also the first state known as \"Turk\". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but many states and peoples later used the name \"Turk\".\n\nTurkic peoples and related groups migrated west from Turkestan and present-day Mongolia towards Eastern Europe, the Iranian plateau and Anatolia (modern Turkey) in many waves. The date of the initial expansion remains unknown. After many battles, they established their own state and later constructed the Ottoman Empire. The main migration occurred in medieval times, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East. They also took part in the military encounters of the Crusades.\n\nLater Turkic peoples include the Karluks (mainly 8th century), Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Oghuz (or Ğuz) Turks, and Turkmens. As these peoples founded states in the area between Mongolia and Transoxiana, they came into contact with Muslims, and most of them gradually adopted Islam. Small groups of Turkic people practice other religions, including Christians, Jews (Khazars), Buddhists, and Zoroastrians.\n\nTurkic soldiers in the army of the Abbasid caliphs emerged as the de facto rulers of most of the Muslim Middle East (apart from Syria and Egypt), particularly after the 10th century. The Oghuz and other tribes captured and dominated various countries under the leadership of the Seljuk dynasty and eventually captured the territories of the Abbasid dynasty and the Byzantine Empire.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yenisei Kyrgyz allied with China to destroy the Uyghur Khaganate in 840. The Kyrgyz people ultimately settled in the region now referred to as Kyrgyzstan. The Bulgars established themselves in between the Caspian and Black Seas in the 5th and 6th centuries, followed by their conquerors, the Khazars who converted to Judaism in the 8th or 9th century. After them came the Pechenegs who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the Cumans and the Kipchaks. One group of Bulgars settled in the Volga region and mixed with local Volga Finns to become the Volga Bulgars in what is today Tatarstan. These Bulgars were conquered by the Mongols following their westward sweep under Genghis Khan in the 13th century. Other Bulgars settled in Southeastern Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and mixed with the Slavic population, adopting what eventually became the Slavic Bulgarian language. Everywhere, Turkic groups mixed with the local populations to varying degrees. In 1090–91, the Turkic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army.\n\nAs the Seljuk Empire declined following the Mongol invasion, the Ottoman Empire emerged as the new important Turkic state, that came to dominate not only the Middle East, but even southeastern Europe, parts of southwestern Russia, and northern Africa.\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate is a term used to cover five short-lived, Delhi-based kingdoms three of which were of Turkic origin in medieval India. These Turkic dynasties were the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90); the Khalji dynasty (1290–1320); and the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414). Southern India, also saw many Turkic origin dynasties like Bahmani Sultanate, Adil Shahi dynasty, Bidar Sultanate, Qutb Shahi dynasty, collectively known as Deccan sultanates.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in 922 and influenced the region as it controlled many trade routes. In the 13th century, Mongols invaded Europe and established the Golden Horde in Eastern Europe, western & northern Central Asia, and even western Siberia. The Cuman-Kipchak Confederation and Islamic Volga Bulgaria were absorbed by the Golden Horde in the 13th century; in the 14th century, Islam became the official religion under Uzbeg Khan where the general population (Turks) as well as the aristocracy (Mongols) came to speak the Kipchak language and were collectively known as \"Tatars\" by Russians and Westerners. This country was also known as the Kipchak Khanate and covered most of what is today Ukraine, as well as the entirety of modern-day southern and eastern Russia (the European section). The Golden Horde disintegrated into several khanates and hordes in the 15th and 16th century including the Crimean Khanate, Khanate of Kazan, and Kazakh Khanate (among others), which were one by one conquered and annexed by the Russian Empire in the 16th through 19th centuries.\n\nIn Siberia, the Siberian Khanate was established in the 1490s by fleeing Tatar aristocrats of the disintegrating Golden Horde who established Islam as the official religion in western Siberia over the partly Islamized native Siberian Tatars and indigenous Uralic peoples. It was the northern-most Islamic state in recorded history and it survived up until 1598 when it was conquered by Russia.\n\nThe Chagatai Khanate was the eastern & southern Central Asian section of the Mongol Empire in what is today part or whole of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Xinjiang (\"Uyghurstan\"). Like the Moghulistan and Golden Horde, the Chagatai Khanate became a Muslim state in the 14th century.\n\nThe Timurid Empire were an Uzbek-based Turkic empire founded in the late 14th century by Timurlane, a descendant of Genghis Khan. Timur, although a self-proclaimed devout Muslim, brought great slaughter in his conquest of fellow Muslims in neighboring Islamic territory and contributed to the ultimate demise of many Muslim states, including the Golden Horde.\n\nThe Mughal Empire was a Turkic-founded Indian empire that, at its greatest territorial extent, ruled most of the South Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and parts of Uzbekistan from the early 16th to the early 18th centuries. The Mughal dynasty was founded by a Chagatai Turkic prince named Babur (reigned 1526–30), who was descended from the Turkic conqueror Timur (Tamerlane) on his father's side and from Chagatai, second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother's side. A further distinction was the attempt of the Mughals to integrate Hindus and Muslims into a united Indian state.\n\nThe Safavid dynasty of Persia were of mixed ancestry (Kurdish and Azerbaijani, which included intermarriages with Georgian, Circassian, and Pontic Greek dignitaries). Through intermarriage and other political considerations, the Safavids spoke Persian and Turkish, and some of the Shahs composed poems in their native Turkish language. Concurrently, the Shahs themselves also supported Persian literature, poetry and art projects including the grand Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp. The Safavid dynasty ruled parts of Greater Iran for more than two centuries. and established the Twelver school of Shi'a Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in Muslim history\n\nThe Afsharid dynasty was named after the Turkic Afshar tribe to which they belonged. The Afshars had migrated from Turkestan to Azerbaijan in the 13th century. The dynasty was founded in 1736 by the military commander Nader Shah who deposed the last member of the Safavid dynasty and proclaimed himself King of Iran. Nader belonged to the Qereqlu branch of the Afshars. During Nader's reign, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sassanid Empire.\n\nThe Muslim Kara-Khanid Turks performed a mass conversion campaign against the Buddhist Uyghur Turks during the Islamicisation and Turkicisation of Xinjiang.\n\nThe non-Muslim Turks worship of Tengri was mocked and insulted by the Muslim Turk Mahmud al-Kashgari, who wrote a verse referring to them – \"The Infidels – May God destroy them!\"\n\nThe Basmil, Yabāḳu and Uyghur states were among the Turkic peoples who fought against the Kara-Khanid's spread of Islam, the Islamic Kara-khanids were made out of Tukhai, Yaghma, Çiğil and Karluk.\n\nKashgari claimed that the Prophet assisted in a miraculous event where 700,000 Yabāqu infidels were defeated by 40,000 Muslims led by Arslān Tegīn claiming that fires shot sparks from gates located on a green mountain towards the Yabāqu. The Yabaqu were a Turkic people.\n\nThe Muslim Kara-Khanid Turk Mahmud Kashgari insulted the Uyghur Buddhists as \"Uighur dogs\" and called them \"Tats\", which referred to the \"Uighur infidels\" according to the Tuxsi and Taghma, while other Turks called Persians \"tat\". While Kashgari displayed a different attitude towards the Turks diviners beliefs and \"national customs\", he expressed towards Buddhism a hatred in his Diwan where he wrote the verse cycle on the war against Uighur Buddhists. Buddhist origin words like toyin (a cleric or priest) and Burxān or Furxan (meaning Buddha, acquiring the generic meaning of \"idol\" in the Turkic language of Kashgari) had negative connotations to Muslim Turks.\n\nProfessor James A. Millward described the original Uyghurs as phenotypically Mongoloid until they began to mix with the Tarim Basin's original, Caucasoid inhabitants, such as the Tocharians and eastern Iranian peoples.\n\nThe Uyghurs of the Qocho and Turfan – whose ancestors had adopted the Buddhism of the Tocharians when they settled in the Tarim – were forcibly converted to Islam during a \"ghazat\" (holy war) by the Chagatai khan Khizr Khwaja. After they had converted to Islam, subsequent generations of Uyghurs came to believe, falsely, that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" (Dzungars) had built Buddhist monuments in the area. The Buddhist murals at the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves were damaged by local Muslim population whose religion proscribed figurative images of sentient beings; the eyes and mouths in particular were often gouged out. Pieces of some murals were broken off for use as fertilizer by the locals.\n\nThe Arab Muslim Umayyads and Abbasids fought against the pagan Turks in the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. The Muslims built ribats (military fortifications) against the non-Muslim Turks in Transoxiana.\n\nThe Medieval Arabs recorded that Medieval Turks looked strange from their perspective and were extremely physically different from the Arabs, calling them \"broad faced people with small eyes\".\n\nMedieval Muslim writers noted that Tibetans and Turks resembled each other and often were not able to tell the difference between Turks and Tibetans.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire gradually grew weaker in the face of poor administration, repeated wars with Russia and Austro-Hungary, and the emergence of nationalist movements in the Balkans, and it finally gave way after World War I to the present-day Republic of Turkey.\nEthnic nationalism also developed in Ottoman Empire during the 19th century, taking the form of Pan-Turkism or Turanism.\n\nThe Turkic peoples of Central Asia were not organized in nation-states during most of the 20th century, after the collapse of the Russian Empire living either in the Soviet Union or (after a short-lived First East Turkestan Republic) in the Chinese Republic.\n\nIn 1991, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, five Turkic states gained their independence. These were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Other Turkic regions such as Tatarstan, Tuva, and Yakutia remained in the Russian Federation. Chinese Turkestan remained part of the People's Republic of China.\n\nImmediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them. Over time political meetings between the Turkic countries increased and led to the establishment of TÜRKSOY in 1993 and later the Turkic Council in 2009.\n\nTurkic ethnic groups are prominent in the world today and there have been Turkic nations in the past.\n\nThe modern list includes:\n\nThe historical list includes:\n\nThe origins of the Huns, Tuoba, and Xiongnu are unknown but may be of Turkic ancestry.\n\nMany of the Turkic peoples have their homelands in Central Asia, where the Turkic peoples settled from China. According to historian John Foster, \"The Turks emerge from among the Huns in the middle of [the] fifth century. They were living in Liang territory when it began to be overrun by the greater principality of Wei. Preferring to remain under the rule of their own kind, they moved westward into what is now the province of Kansu. This was the territory of kindred Huns, who were called the Rouran. The Turks were a small tribe of only five hundred families, and they became serfs to the Rouran, who used them as iron-workers. It is thought that the original meaning of \"Turk\" is \"helmet\", and that they may have taken this name because of the shape of one of the hills near which they worked. As their numbers and power grew, their chief made bold to ask for the hand of a Rouran princess in marriage. The demand was refused, and war followed. In 546, the iron-workers defeated their overlords.\" Since then Turkic languages have spread, through migrations and conquests, to other locations including present-day Turkey. While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term \"Turkish\" usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nThe Turkic languages constitute a language family of some 30 languages, spoken across a vast area from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, to Siberia and Western China, and through to the Middle East.\n\nSome 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language; an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a second language. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish proper, or Anatolian Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers. More than one third of these are ethnic Turks of Turkey, dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly Ottoman-dominated areas of Eastern Europe and West Asia; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the Caucasus, China, and northern Iraq.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan; There are also several Turkic national subdivisions in the Russian Federation including Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Khakassia, Tuva, Yakutia, the Altai Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to Russian).\n\nThe Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in western China and the autonomous region of Gagauzia, located within eastern Moldova and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine is a home of Crimean Tatars. In addition, there are several communities found in Iraq, Georgia, Bulgaria, the Republic of Macedonia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and western Mongolia.\n\nThe Turks in Turkey are over 60 million to 70 million worldwide, while the second largest Turkic people are the [[Azerbaijanis]], numbering 22 to 38 million worldwide; most of them live in Azerbaijan and Iran.\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n[[File:Map-TurksoyMembers.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Map of [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture|TÜRKSOY]] members.]]\n\nThere are several international organizations created with the purpose of furthering cooperation between countries with Turkic-speaking populations, such as the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] (TÜRKSOY) and the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-speaking Countries (TÜRKPA).\n\nThe newly established [[Turkic Council]], founded on November 3, 2009 by the \"Nakhchivan Agreement\" confederation, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and Turkey, aims to integrate these organizations into a tighter geopolitical framework.\n\nThe [[TAKM]] – Organization of the Eurasian Law Enforcement Agencies with Military Status, established on 25 January 2013.\n\n[[File:Bashkir in Paris.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Bashkirs]], painting from 1812, Paris]]\nThe distribution of people of Turkic cultural background ranges from [[Siberia]], across Central Asia, to Eastern Europe. the largest groups of Turkic people live throughout Central Asia—[[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Azerbaijan]], in addition to [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. Additionally, Turkic people are found within [[Crimea]], [[Altishahr]] region of western [[China]], northern [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Russia]], [[Afghanistan]], and the [[Balkans]]: [[Moldova]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], and former [[Yugoslavia]]. A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]]. Small numbers inhabit eastern [[Poland]] and the south-eastern part of [[Finland]]. There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nMuch of the Turkic population of Central Asia has significant Caucasoid and Mongoloid ancestry. The genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.\n\nHistorical population:\n\nThe Turkic people display a great variety of ethnic types. They possess physical features ranging from [[Caucasoid]] to [[Northern Mongoloid]]. Mongoloid and Caucasoid facial structure is common among many Turkic groups, such as [[Chuvash people]], [[Tatars]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Uzbeks]], and [[Bashkirs]].\n\nThe following incomplete list of Turkic people shows the respective groups' core areas of settlement and their estimated sizes (in millions):\n\n\nThis list includes [[dependent territories]] within their [[List of sovereign states|sovereign states]] (including uninhabited territories), but does not include claims on [[Antarctica]].

The [[Codex]] was designed in order to help [[Catholic]] [[missionaries]] communicate with the [[Cumans|Kumans]].]]\n\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, Greek-derived [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography. The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[Göktürk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century.\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Huns|Hunnic]] and Bulgaric, are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\nMarkets in the steppe region had a limited range of foodstuffs available—mostly [[grain]]s, [[dried fruit]]s, [[spices]], and [[tea]]. Turks mostly herded [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[horse]]s. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as \"süt\" (milk), \"yagh\" (butter), [[ayran]], \"[[kaymak|qaymaq]]\" (similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[Kumis|qi̅mi̅z]] (fermented mare's milk) and \"[[qurut]]\" (dried yoghurt). During the Middle Ages [[Kazakh cuisine|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Tatar cuisine|Tatars]], who were historically part of the Turkic nomadic group known as the [[Golden Horde]], continued to develop new variations of dairy products. \n\nNomadic Turks cooked their meals in a \"[[Kazan (cookware)|qazan]]\", a pot similar to a [[cauldron]]; a wooden rack called a \"qasqan\" can be used to prepare certain steamed foods, like the traditional meat dumplings called \"[[Manti (food)|manti]]\". They also used a \"saj\", a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and \"[[skewer|shish]]\". In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a \"chanaq\", and eaten with a knife (\"bïchaq\") and spoon (\"qashi̅q\"). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called \"oqlaghu\", a [[colander]] called \"süzgu̅çh\", and a grinding stone called \"tāgirmān\".\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called \"qawïrmach\", while \"köchä\" was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. \"Salma\" were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called \"tutmaj\" in the Middle Ages and are called \"[[kesme]]\" today.\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. \"[[Yufka|Yupqa]]\" is the thinnest type of dough, \"[[Bawirsaq|bawi̅rsaq]]\" is a type of fried bread dough, and \"[[Shelpek|chälpäk]]\" is a deep fried flat bread. \"[[Qatlama]]\" is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. \"[[Toqach]]\" and \"[[chöräk]]\" are varieties of bread, and [[Börek|böräk]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called \"[[sujuk]]\". Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called \"[[Qazı|qazi̅]]\", was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called \"qïyma\" and spit-roasted meat was \"söklünch\"—from the root \"sök-\" meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times. \"[[Kavurma|Qawirma]]\" is a typical fried meat dish, and \"[[kullama]]\" is a soup of noodles and lamb.\n\n[[File:Kyzyl Shaman.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|A shaman doctor of [[Kyzyl]].]]\n\nPre-Islamic [[Turkic mythology]] was dominated by [[Tengrism]] and [[Shamanism in Central Asia|shamanism]]. The chief deity was\n[[Tengri]], a [[sky god]], worshipped by the upper classes of early Turkic society until [[Manichaeism]] was introduced as the official religion of the [[Uyghur Empire]] in 763.\nThe [[gray wolf|wolf]] symbolizes honour and is also considered the mother of most Turkic peoples. [[Asena]] (Ashina Tuwu) is the wolf mother of [[Tumen Il-Qağan]], the first Khan of the [[Göktürks]].

It was gradually replaced by the [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. It existed in the Buddhist Uyghur [[Gaochang]] up to the 12th century.\n\n[[Tibetan Buddhism]], or [[Vajrayana]] was the main religion after Manichaeism. They worshipped [[Buddha|Täŋri Täŋrisi Burxan]], [[Guanyin|Quanšï Im Pusar]] and [[Maitreya|Maitri Burxan]]. Turkic [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] and west [[Xinjiang]] attributed with a rapid and almost total disappearance of it and other religions in North India and Central Asia.

The [[Crimean Karaites|Khazars]] widely practiced Judaism before their conversion to Islam.\n\nEven though many Turkic peoples became [[Islam|Muslims]] under the influence of [[Sufi]]s, often of Shī‘ah persuasion, most Turkic people today are [[Sunni]] Muslims, although a significant number in Turkey are [[Alevi]]s. Alevi Turks, who were once primarily dwelling in eastern Anatolia, are today concentrated in major urban centers in western Turkey with the increased urbanism.\n\nThe major Christian-Turkic peoples are the [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] of [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]] and the [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] (\"Gökoğuz\") of [[Moldova]]. The traditional religion of the [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] of Russia, while containing many ancient Turkic concepts, also shares some elements with [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Khazar]] Judaism, and Islam.\nThe Chuvash converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] for the most part in the second half of the 19th century. As a result, festivals and rites were made to coincide with Orthodox feasts, and Christian rites replaced their traditional counterparts. A minority of the Chuvash still profess their traditional faith. [[Church of the East]] was popular among Turks such as the [[Naimans]].

{"id": "33787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33787", "title": "Wrecking (shipwreck)", "text": "Wrecking (shipwreck)\n\nWrecking is the practice of taking valuables from a shipwreck which has foundered or run aground close to shore. Often an unregulated activity of opportunity in coastal communities, wrecking has been subjected to increasing regulation and evolved into what is now known as marine salvage. Wrecking is no longer economically significant; however, as recently as the 19th century in some parts of the world, it was the mainstay of otherwise economically marginal coastal communities.\n\nA traditional legend is of wreckers deliberately decoying ships on to coasts using tricks (in particular false lights), so that they run ashore and can be plundered. While this has been depicted in many stories and legends, it is uncertain that this has ever happened.\n\nThere are legends that some ships were deliberately lured into danger by a display of false lights. John Viele, retired U. S. Navy officer and author of a history of wrecking in the Florida Keys, states that such tricks simply would not work. He points out that mariners interpret a light as indicating land, and so avoid them if they cannot identify them. Moreover, oil lanterns cannot be seen very far over water at night, unless they are large, fitted with mirrors or lenses, and mounted at a great height (i.e., in a lighthouse). In hundreds of admiralty court cases heard in Key West, Florida, no captain of a wrecked ship ever charged that he had been led astray by a false light. A Bahamian wrecker, when asked if he and his crewmates made beacons on shore or showed their lights to warn ships away from the land at night, is reported to have said, \"No, no [laughing]; we always put them out for a better chance by night\".\n\nLegend maintains that the town of Nags Head, North Carolina takes its name from wreckers or \"Bankers\" deploying false lights. The Nags Head urban legend states that in the 18th century, wreckers would hang lanterns from the necks of mules (colloquially called \"nags\" at the time) and walk the animals very slowly up and down the beach. The alleged intent was to fool mariners into believing that the slow-moving lights were ships drifting at rest or at anchor, prompting the ships to change course and subsequently run aground. In 1860, a writer for \"Harper’s New Monthly Magazine\" corroborates the story of the \"Bankers\" who gave Nags Head its name.\n\nAs soon as the Spanish began sending home the treasures they found in the New World, some of the treasure was lost in shipwrecks. By the 1540s Indians along the coast of Florida, where many of the Spanish treasure ships wrecked, were diving on the wrecks and recovering significant amounts of gold and silver. By that time the Spanish had been using first Indians (the Lucayans from the Bahamas were particularly prized for the task) and then Africans to dive for pearls around the islands near present-day Venezuela. The Spanish began using these divers to recover treasure from shipwrecks. The Spanish kept salvage ships with crews of African divers on-call in major ports around the Caribbean, ready to sail as soon as word of a wreck was received. In the course of the 16th through the 18th centuries the Spanish recovered more than 100,000,000 pesos worth of treasure by such means. Spanish salvage efforts had varying success. Although the Spanish carried out salvage operations on the wrecks of the 1715 Treasure Fleet for four years, they recovered less than half of the treasure recorded as sent on the fleet. On the other hand, the Spanish recovered more treasure from the 1733 treasure fleet than had been officially registered on it.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries Spanish ships returning to Spain from the Caribbean rode the Gulf Stream to Cape Canaveral and then aimed for Bermuda. Raising Bermuda was essential to Spanish ships for verifying their position before setting course for the Azores. As a result, some Spanish ships wrecked on Bermuda. After the English settled on Bermuda in the early 17th century, they quickly took up \"wracking\" on Bermuda, and then extended their search for wrecks to all of the Caribbean. Later in the 17th century the center for English \"wracking\" in the Caribbean shifted to Port Royal in Jamaica. William Phips went there to recruit the divers he used to salvage treasure from a Spanish wreck on the north shore of Hispaniola, where he recovered the largest amount of treasure from a single wreck before the 20th century.\nWrecking (or \"wracking\") was an important activity in the Bahamas from its first settlement in 1648. A company of religious dissidents from Bermuda, the Eleutheran Adventurers, established a colony on Eleutheria. Their governing document, the \"Articles and Orders\", included regulations of wrecking, providing that any salvaged ordnance would be held in common for the defense of the colony, and all other salvaged goods would be delivered to designated agents, \"made fit for sale\" and then sold, with one-third of the proceeds going to the wreckers.\n\nWhile the Eleutheran Adventurers were primarily farmers, seamen from Bermuda began settling on New Providence in the 1660s, attracted by ambergris, wrecks and salt. There were vessels dedicated to wrecking from this time, but wrecking was a secondary occupation for most men. These seamen, who called themselves \"wrackers\" or \"wreckers\", pursued wrecking aggressively, regarding all salvage as their property. They were rumored to have killed people who had inconveniently survived a shipwreck. They drove Spanish salvors away from Spanish wrecks, and even took goods that the Spanish had already salvaged. Spain regarded the Bahamian wreckers as pirates, and retaliated by attacking the wreckers' ships, kidnapping farmers from New Providence, and burning the capital, Charles Town.\n\nThe Bahamian government eventually exerted control over the wreckers. The wreckers were required to carry salvaged goods to Nassau, where they were auctioned. However, goods useful on a ship or in a wrecker's home were often diverted with a blind eye turned by government officials. Increased shipping after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 led to more wrecks. Vessels specifically designed for wrecking were built in the Bahamas. A U.S law of 1825 required that all goods salvaged from wrecks in U.S. waters be taken to an American port of entry (which, for the Bahamians, meant Key West, Florida). Many Bahamian wreckers eventually moved to Key West and became U.S. citizens.\n\nWrecking was a mainstay of the Bahamian economy through most of the 19th century. In 1856 there were 302 ships and 2,679 men (out of a total population of 27,000) licensed as wreckers in the Bahamas. In that year salvaged wreck cargo brought to Nassau was valued at £96,304, more than half of all imports to the Bahamas. More than two-thirds of exports from the Bahamas were salvaged goods. The government normally took 15% customs duty on salvaged goods. If the salvaged cargo was not claimed, the Vice Admiralty Court took 30%, and the Governor took another 10%. Shore workers (warehouse workers, agents and laborers) usually received around 14% of the value. The wreckers themselves usually received 40% to 60% of the value of the salvaged goods. Even so, the average annual income of an ordinary seaman on a wrecker was about ₤20.\n\nThe American Civil War sharply cut the volume of shipping around the Bahamas, and the wreckers suffered with far fewer wrecks to salvage. The end of the Civil War brought back increased shipping and wrecks. In 1865, the last year of the Civil War, £28,000 worth of salvaged goods were taken to Nassau. In 1866 that rose to £108,000, and peaked at £154,000 in 1870. Wrecking then entered a decline, and was nearly gone by the end of the 19th century. More lighthouses (eventually numbering 37 in the Bahamas), better charts, more ships powered by steam, better qualified ship's officers, and more seaworthy ships all contributed to fewer wrecks.\n\nFor several centuries wrecking was an important economic activity in the Florida Keys. During the 19th century wrecking in the Keys became a highly organized and regulated industry, with dozens of vessels and hundreds of men active in the trade at any given time. The Florida Keys form a long arc of islands extending from the southern end of the east coast of Florida to the Dry Tortugas. A line of shallow coral reefs, the Florida Reef, runs parallel to the Keys from east of Cape Florida to southwest of Key West, with dangerous shoals stretching west from Key West to the Dry Tortugas. This chain of reefs and shoals is approximately long, separated from the Keys by the narrow and relatively shallow Hawk Channel. The Gulf Stream passes close to the Florida Reef through the Straits of Florida, which is the major route for shipping between the eastern coast of the United States and ports in the Gulf of Mexico and the western Caribbean Sea. The combination of heavy shipping and a powerful current flowing close to dangerous reefs made the Florida Keys the site of a great many wrecks, especially during the 19th century. Ships were wrecking on the Florida Reef at the rate of almost once a week in the middle of the 19th century (the collector of customs in Key West reported a rate of 48 wrecks a year in 1848). For a period of almost 100 years, wrecking captains and wrecking vessels in the Keys had to hold a license issued by the Federal court. In 1858 there were 47 boats and ships licensed as wreckers.\n\nShips began wrecking along the Florida Reef almost as soon as Europeans reached the New World. From early in the 16th century, Spanish ships returning from the New World to Spain sailed from Havana to catch the Gulf Stream, which meant they passed close to the Florida Reef, with some wrecking. The first wreckers in the Keys were Indians; when Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda's ship was wrecked in 1549, he was taken prisoner by Indians who were experienced in plundering wrecked ships. In 1622, six ships of the Spanish treasure fleet wrecked during a hurricane in the lower Keys. Spanish operations to recover the gold and silver from the lost ships continued intermittently for 21 years, but the Spanish lost track of the \"Nuestra Señora de Atocha\", which was finally found and excavated in the 20th century. In 1733, 19 ships of the Spanish treasure fleet wrecked during a hurricane in the middle and upper keys, and salvage operations lasted four years. The Spanish used dragged chains, grapnels, free divers and even an early diving bell to find and recover goods from the wrecked ships.\n\nStarting in the 18th century ships from The Bahamas began frequenting the Florida Keys. The Bahamians were opportunists, fishing, turtling, logging tropical hardwoods on the Keys, and salvaging wrecks as the opportunity arose. When the Spanish were salvaging the wrecks of the 1733 treasure fleet, the Spanish commander of the operation expressed concern that the Bahamians would try to salvage some of the treasure on their own. By 1775, George Gauld, who produced a chart of the Keys that was still being used 75 years later, advised mariners to stay with their ships if they wrecked, so that the Bahamian wreckers could assist them. Although the Keys were at various times part of Spanish Florida, the British colony of East Florida and the U.S. Florida Territory, the Bahamians took goods salvaged from ships wrecked in the Keys to Nassau for adjudication, rather than to the Florida port of entry, St. Augustine. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812 in 1815, increased shipping through the Straights of Florida resulted in an increase in wrecks on the Keys, and the Crown's share from the auction of salvaged goods became the major support of the economy of Nassau.\n\nAfter 1815, fishing boats from New England began visiting the Florida Keys in the winter to fish for the Havana market. These fishermen engaged in wrecking when the opportunity arose. With the acquisition of Florida by the United States in 1821 and the settlement of Key West in 1822, the New England fishermen-wreckers began moving their homes to Key West. Conflicts quickly developed with the Bahamian wreckers. U.S. Navy ships stopped and boarded Bahamian wreckers to check papers, and arrested two Bahamian captains on suspicion of smuggling slaves. American wreckers became increasingly hostile to Bahamian wreckers, and in 1825 the U.S. Congress passed a law requiring all goods salvaged in U.S. waters to be taken to an American port of entry. This measure created a great inconvenience for the Bahamian wreckers, as they had to take salvaged goods and ships to Key West before they could return home to the Bahamas. Some of them soon moved to Key West and acquired U.S. citizenship.\n\nKey West had become a port of entry in 1822. In the same year the U.S. Navy chose Key West as its base for suppressing piracy in the West Indies. The city quickly developed into Florida's most important port. By the 1830s Key West accounted for 60% to 90% of imports and exports for the Territory. Most of this traffic was due to the activities of the wreckers. Warehouses for storing salvaged goods, shipyards for repairing damaged ships that had been removed from the reefs and for building vessels to be used in wrecking, and ship chandlers for refitting ships all contributed to the city's prosperity.\n\nIn the 1820s and 1830s Indian Key functioned as a secondary center for the wrecking industry in the Keys. Closer to most of the reefs off the keys than Key West, Indian Key enjoyed a brief prosperity before being destroyed in a raid by Seminoles in 1840.\n\nWrecking in the Florida Keys was conducted from sailing vessels. Numerous vessels would patrol along the Florida Reef looking for wrecks. The wreckers would normally anchor at night in protected anchorages along the Keys, and then sail out in the morning to see if any ships had wrecked during the night. As a result, a ship that ran on the reef during the night might attract a dozen wreckers by the afternoon of the next day. The first wrecking captain to reach a stranded ship became the wreck master, determining how many wreckers he needed to help salvage the ship, and directing the operation. Wreckers had an obligation to save passengers and crew of the wrecked ship (for which they received no compensation), and to salvage as much of the cargo as possible, and the ship, as well. If the judge in Federal court decided that a wrecking crew had not done everything possible to salvage cargo and ship, he would reduce the award.\n\nThe salvaged cargo and the ship, if it could be saved, were taken to Key West where they were appraised or auctioned. The wrecking vessels and crews that participated in the operations would then be awarded a share of the salvage value. Half of the salvage award went to the owners of the wrecking vessels, divided among the boats on a tonnage basis. The other half went to the wrecker crews, proportional to the number of crewmen on each vessel. Ordinary crewmen received one share, \"boys\" a half-share, cooks, one-and-a-quarter shares, and captains one to three shares, depending on the size of the vessel. Divers, who dove into the flooded holds of ships to retrieve cargo, received extra shares. By the time a salvage award was divided this way, individual shares were often quite small. Contemporary observers estimated that wrecking crews on average made no more than an ordinary seaman.\n\nIn the first few years after Florida was acquired by the United States, salvage awards were determined either by prior agreement between the wreck master and the captain of the wrecked ship, or by arbitration. As the persons available to serve as arbitrators usually had ties to the wrecking industry, if not a direct business relationship with the wreck master and/or the owners of the wrecking vessels, the process was often abused, with awards as high as 90% of the salvaged value. In 1829 a United States District Court was established in Key West with admiralty jurisdiction, after which most salvage cases were decided in court. Court awards for a wrecking operation averaged about 25% of the salvage value. Private agreements and arbitration remained an option, however, particularly when the judge was not available. A visitor to Key West in the 1880s reported that the United States District Court was in session almost every week, and had heard more than 700 Admiralty law cases during the preceding year.\n\nWreckers were required by the Federal law to carry equipment that might be needed to save cargo and ships. Such equipment included heavy anchors for kedging (hauling) ships off reefs, heavy hawsers and chain, fenders and blocks and tackle. Wreckers also had to be prepared to make emergency repairs to ships to refloat them or keep them afloat while they were sailed or towed back to Key West. By the middle of the 19th century windmill-powered pumps, and later a steam-powered pump, were kept in Key West. If the wreckers were not able to pump out a ship fast enough to float it using the ship's own pumps, they could rent one of the large pumps from Key West. As the wrecking vessels could not always directly approach wrecked ships, they had to carry sturdy boats.\n\nCargoes saved by wreckers varied tremendously. Cotton was perhaps the most valuable bulk cargo. A bale of cotton might be worth US$50 or $60 in Charleston, South Carolina, but a bale pulled from a flooded hold would be saturated with water, and weigh as much as half a ton. Unusual cargoes salvaged by wreckers included the fossilized \"Hydrarchos\" skeleton collected in Alabama by Albert Koch, and a locomotive. In 1827 \"Guerrero\", a Spanish slave-runner carrying 500 African captives, and the Royal Navy warship HMS \"Nimble\" ran onto the Florida Reef during a running gun battle. Wreckers went to the aid of both ships. After most of the Africans and the Spanish crewmen had been transferred to wrecker vessels, the Spanish crewmen commandeered two of the ships and sailed to Cuba with most of the Africans. The remaining 120 Africans were taken to Key West, and then to St. Augustine. After Congress passed a special law the next year, 96 surviving Africans were sent to Liberia.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the number of wrecks along the Florida Reef, the United States government funded the construction of lighthouses. Lighthouses were built in the 1820s at Cape Florida, Key West (both on the island itself and on nearby Sand Key, and on Garden Key in the Dry Tortugas. A lightship was stationed at Carysfort Reef. Mariners complained that the lights were not visible enough. There were also long interruptions. The Cape Florida lighthouse was burned by Seminoles in 1836 and remained dark for ten years. It was also dark while the tower was made higher in 1855. It was put out of commission again in 1860 by Confederate sympathizers and remained dark until the end of the American Civil War in 1865. The Key West and Sand Key lighthouses were destroyed by a hurricane in 1846. A lightship was placed at Sand Key until the lighthouses could be rebuilt. Beginning in 1852 lighthouses were built directly on the Florida Reef, but it was 1880 before mariners could rely on having a lighthouse in sight at all times while sailing along the Florida Reef.\n\nThe wreckers were unhappy about the lights, expecting them to reduce the number of wrecks and their livelihood. Initially, however, the lights did not greatly reduce the number of wrecks. Some ships wrecked when their captains became confused about which lights they were seeing, mistaking lights on the Florida Reef for lights on the Bahama Banks. Some wrecks may have been deliberate, as well. On a few occasions wreckers trying to refloat flooded ships discovered that holes had been bored through the hull below the water line. The captain of a ship that had wrecked stated that the wreck was not to be greatly regretted, as there were too many ships in the freight business. Judge Marvin of the Federal court in Key West told a navy officer in 1860 there was \"a great deal of wrecking by design.\"\n\nShipping through the Straits of Florida, and therefore the number of wrecks on the Florida Reef, declined sharply during the Civil War. Following the Civil War, the number of wrecks did not increase as fast as the ship traffic through the Straits. More lighthouses were in place, better charts were available, and more ships were powered by steam and thus less vulnerable to being pushed onto reefs by unfavorable winds. Steam-powered vessels began to enter the wrecking trade. Eventually ocean-going tugboats took over what became known as marine salvage operations. By the end of the 19th century wrecks were infrequent. The last major wrecking operation was in 1905, when 77 small vessels and 500 men salvaged cargo from the steamer \"Alicia\". Salvage work was abandoned when divers refused to continue, as contaminated water in the hold was causing them to become blind for 24 hours after a dive. The salvage award was US$17,690. The last local wrecker was bought out by a New York company in 1920. The Federal court closed the book of wrecking licenses the next year.\n\nResidents of the isolated communities along the outer banks of North Carolina and the Islands of Hatteras, Ocracoke, and Portsmouth and in Newfoundland and the islands and coastline of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and engaged in wrecking for many years. In Nova Scotia, Seal Island and especially Sable Island were known for wrecking. Reports of violent wreckers on Sable helped spur efforts by the colony of Nova Scotia to establish a rescue station in Sable Island in 1801.\n\nWrecking was well known in Devon and Cornwall where the rocky coastline, and strong prevailing onshore winds helped wreck many merchant ships and warships. It is rumoured that ships were sometimes deliberately attracted: false lights on the shore were said to be used sometimes to lead ships into disaster. However, there is no evidence to support these ideas.\n\nIn 1735 a law was passed to make it an offence to make false lights, but no one was prosecuted as a result. In 1769 William Pearse was hanged at Launceston in Cornwall for stealing from a wreck. It was not until after a case in the Court of Appeal in 1870 that rewards were made for rescuing people.\n\nWrecking was a major industry in the 19th century, and as far back as the 16th century, especially of ships returning from the New World using the Gulf Stream, which passes by the south west of England. This would help to speed these ships on their way to France and Spain and put them out of position. Wreckers would attempt to frighten off the curious, suspicious or unwanted visitors, by spreading wild rumours concerning supernatural activity, ghosts and cannibals (as occurred in Clovelly) near their wrecking sites.\n\nWrecking was a major activity of the inhabitants of Stroma Island in the Pentland Firth off the north of Scotland. It was also well known on the Goodwin Sands off the south east of England where over 2000 wrecks have occurred. The boatmen of Deal, who took supplies to ships at anchor off the coast, would plunder any wrecked vessel. Another area where wrecking was prevalent was the Wirral Peninsula, near Liverpool, where wrecking continued to be reported into the early twentieth century.\n\nA 2005 BBC documentary, \"Coast\", successfully replicated the conditions of false light wrecking in an experiment which suggested that a single-candle lantern onshore would be sufficient to lure a boat into dangerous water on a dark night. It should be noted that the boat crew did not see the light until they got within 150m of it.\n\nIn 2007 the container ship MSC \"Napoli\" went aground off Branscombe beach in Devon. Some of its cargo was washed ashore and many wreckers plundered the cargo in spite of attempts to prevent this. People came long distances to retrieve such things as BMW motorcycles. Goods from wrecks are supposed by law to be reported to the \"Receiver of Wreck\" and finders will then be given a reward.\n\nWrecking has been practised a long way back in Denmark. The long shorelines, the heavy international marine traffic in combination with some difficult and often harsh waters, has produced many wrecks here. It was only recently, that the light signalling was fully developed and deep sea-bed canals were dug in the often very shallow waters here, making seafaring relatively safe. Skagen's Vippefyr was constructed in 1627, along with several other rudimentary lighting signals in the following years, after complaints. Sea floor canals came centuries later. It was and still is common practice to hire skilled Danish pilots to help navigate in and out of the Baltic Sea.\n\nSo-called wreck masters used to be employed in the Danish coastal communities, in order to oversee, report on and collect valuables from new wrecks. A former wreck masters home can be experienced at the Wreck Master's Farm near Rubjerg Knude on the North Atlantic coast for example. The last wreck master here left in 1992. A few wreck masters are still appointed in Denmark, but nowadays the job also includes observations and reporting on oil spills, pollutions, vandalism, etc., and they work in close cooperation with the police.\n\nWreckers have been featured in a number of works of fiction, including a references in \"The Shipping News\" by E. Annie Proulx, \"Jamaica Inn\" by Daphne du Maurier, \"Shipwrecks\" by Akira Yoshimura, the film \"The Light at the Edge of the World\" based on the novel \"Le Phare du bout du monde\" by Jules Verne, and also in the opening chapter of Verne's \"The Archipelago on Fire\".\n\nThe plot of Compton Mackenzie's novel \"Whisky Galore\" revolves around the inhabitants of a small Scottish island recovering as-yet-untaxed whisky from a shipwreck and their subsequent efforts at evading government officials.\n\nDame Ethel Smyth's opera, \"The Wreckers\", is set in Cornwall—the plot revolves around deliberate wrecking.\n\nIn 1942, the Technicolor Movie \"Reap The Wild Wind \" by Cecil B. DeMille depicted life in the wrecking business in the Nineteenth Century around Key West, Florida. It garnered an Academy Award for underwater Special Effects.\n\nIn 1962, the \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\" TV series aired a two-episode live action adventure film entitled \"The Mooncussers\" about the investigation and exposure of a gang of wreckers.\n\nEnid Blyton, specifically in the \"Famous Five\" books, writes often about the treasures of the wreckers.\n\n\"The Wreckers\", by Iain Lawrence, is a book for younger readers about \"The Isle of Skye\" (a London vessel) being shipwrecked along the shores of Pendennis, Cornwall.\n\nCanadian progressive rock band Rush included a song on their 2012 album \"Clockwork Angels\" titled \"The Wreckers\", the lyrics of which were inspired by historical tales of wreckers luring ships to their demise.\n\n\"Crimson Shore\" is part of the Agent Pendergast series by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. The main story involves a ship, the \"Pembroke Castle\", being purposefully wrecked on the rocks off the coast of Massachusetts. \n\n\"Coot Club\", the fifth of Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of books, features wreckers on the Norfolk Broads.\n\n\"The Wreck of the Zanzibar\" is a Whitbread Award-winning children's novel by Michael Morpurgo, set on the Isles of Scilly.\n\n\"H.M.S. Dolores\" is a 2016 board game whose plot centers around rival crews of wreckers.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1031691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1031691", "title": "Yi Jianlian", "text": "Yi Jianlian\n\nYi Jianlian ( ; born October 27, 1984) is a Chinese professional basketball player for the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). He has also played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, Washington Wizards and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nYi joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2002–03 CBA season, and subsequently won the CBA Rookie of the Year award. In his first five years with Guangdong, the team won three CBA titles. In the 2007 NBA draft, he was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick. Initially, Yi declined to sign with Milwaukee for several months before agreeing to a contract with them on 29 August 2007. He later played for three other NBA teams until returning to the Guangdong Southern Tigers in 2012.\n\nYi also plays for the Chinese national team, having represented his country at the Olympics in 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016, as well as the 2006 and 2010 FIBA World Championships.\n\nAs a child, Yi's parents did not allow him to join a sports school, which is designed for children predicted to be future professional athletes. However, a sports school's basketball coach who noticed Yi's potential in playing street basketball persuaded Yi's family to allow him to train professionally. Hoping to sign Yi to an endorsement deal, Adidas invited him to attend the company's ABCD camp in New Jersey in 2002, where he competed against all-American high school players.\n\nAfter returning to China later that year, he signed a professional contract with Chinese Basketball Association side Guangdong Southern Tigers and averaged 3.5 points and 1.9 rebounds per game in his first season. He also averaged 7.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in four games during the playoffs, and won the Rookie of the Year award. Yi was featured in \"TIME\"s August 2003 article titled \"The Next Yao Ming\". In each of his next three seasons, Yi led Guangdong to the CBA championship and he was awarded the CBA finals' most valuable player honor in 2006. In Yi's final season in the Chinese Basketball Association before he entered the 2007 NBA draft, he averaged a career-high 24.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game, but his team lost to the Bayi Rockets in the playoff finals.\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, Yi signed a one-year contract to return to the Guangdong Southern Tigers. Unlike most NBA players who went to the Chinese Basketball Association during that time, he received an option to return to the NBA once the lockout had been resolved. After the lockout ended, he signed with the Dallas Mavericks for the remainder of the 2011–12 season. Yi re-joined the Guangdong Southern Tigers for the 2012–13 CBA season and went on to win a fourth championship that season.\n\nIn October 2016, Yi returned to Guangdong after spending training camp with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nYi was not expected to enter the NBA draft until 2009 because the Chinese Basketball Association ruled that players are not allowed to leave for foreign leagues until they turned 22. In early 2006, however, Yi announced that he would enter the 2006 NBA draft although he eventually decided to withdraw, saying he was \"not good enough to compete in the NBA and needed more experience.\" Later that year, the Guangdong Southern Tigers announced that Yi would enter the 2007 NBA draft.\n\nYi chose Dan Fegan as his agent to represent him in the NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted by many to be picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them to be one of the teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016.\n\nAfter the draft, Milwaukee attempted to convince Yi to sign with the team and on 2 July 2007, the owner of the Bucks franchise, Herb Kohl, wrote a letter to Yi and his representatives, hoping to persuade Yi to sign with the team. Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for would have to give him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.\n\nYi was named to Milwaukee's starting lineup by head coach Larry Krystkowiak in place of Charlie Villanueva to begin the 2007–08 season. He recorded nine points and three rebounds in a debut loss to the Orlando Magic. He played his first home game in Milwaukee three days later and scored 16 points while grabbing eight boards in a 78–72 win over the Chicago Bulls. The game was also Yi's first game to be televised nationally in China, where it was watched by an estimated 100 million viewers. Yao Ming praised Yi's play in his first few games, saying, \"If you compare us in our third NBA games, you will see that Yi's statistics are far better than mine.\"\n\nOn 9 November 2007, Yi played against Yao for the first time when the Houston Rockets hosted Milwaukee in a 104–88 loss. Yi recorded 19 points and nine rebounds, including two three-pointers, while Yao recorded 28 points and nine rebounds. The game between the two was watched by over 200 million people in China, making it one of the most-watched games in NBA history. After the game, Yao called Yi's talent \"unbelievable\" and Tracy McGrady said that Yi had a \"tremendous upside in this league\". Del Harris, the former head coach of the Chinese national basketball team, also described Yi as the \"most athletic 7-footer in the NBA.\"\n\nYi was named the NBA Rookie of the Month for December 2007 after averaging 12.1 points and 6.6 rebounds per game that month, while scoring a career-high 29 points on 14-of-17 shooting in a win over the Charlotte Bobcats on December 22. On 30 January 2008, he was selected for the rookie team in the Rookie Challenge at the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. On 2 February 2008, Yi faced Yao for the second time when Milwaukee played at home against Houston, which Krystkowiak dubbed the \"Chinese Super Bowl.\" However, both players struggled during Houston's 91–83 victory over Milwaukee. Yao scored 12 points while Yi injured his shoulder during the game, finishing with just six points.\n\nOn 2 April 2008, it was announced that Yi would miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Having already missed eight games with other injuries, Yi managed 66 out of a possible 82 games in his rookie season, averaging 8.6 points and 5.2 rebounds per game. One of Milwaukee's assistant coaches, Brian James, later said that \"the injuries he had bothered him more than people realized, and he couldn't play through them.\"\n\nOn 26 June 2008, Yi was traded by the Milwaukee Bucks along with Bobby Simmons to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Richard Jefferson. New Jersey's team president Rod Thorn said that \"we feel strongly he's going to be a real good player,\" and the team's chief executive Brett Yormark said \"it opens up a truly new fan base for us.\" Yi stated that he didn't expect to be traded, but that it was \"an honor to join the Nets.\"\n\nThrough his first 37 games with New Jersey, Yi averaged 10.5 points and 6.2 rebounds per game while shooting 39% from behind the three-point line, which was well above his average from the previous season. But on 9 January 2009, Yi broke the little finger on his right hand and was expected to miss four to six weeks. Thorn called it \"lousy timing\" because \"he'd been playing well,\" but Yi said \"(I'll) just take my time. I'll come back.\" In voting for the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, Yi finished third in total votes for forwards in the Eastern Conference, ahead of players such as Paul Pierce and Chris Bosh.\n\nYi made his return from injury after the 2009 NBA All-Star Game in a loss to the Houston Rockets on 17 February 2009. However, after averaging only six points on 36% shooting after his return, Yi was removed from the team's starting lineup. His final averages for the season were 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, as well as a 38% shooting percentage from the field and 34% on three-point field goals. After New Jersey finished the season outside of the playoffs, Yi's agent Dan Fegan suggested New Jersey played better when Yi played more minutes and took more shots, and said it \"begs the question[sic]...who's accountable?\" New Jersey's head coach Lawrence Frank said that \"you have to be patient. He's only 21\", and Yi assessed his season by saying he was \"still too much up and down.\"\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Yi returned to the starting lineup for New Jersey. Starting in every game he played but one, Yi suffered several injuries during the season which made him miss 30 games. He sprained his medial collateral ligament on 4 November 2009, had a laceration on his upper lip on 8 December 2009, and sprained his left ankle on 8 March 2009. His final averages for the season were 12 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, as well as a 40% shooting percentage from the field and 37% on three-point field goals.\n\nOn 29 June 2010, Yi was traded to the Washington Wizards along with $3 million in cash considerations for Quinton Ross. Yi ended the 2010–11 season averaging 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game. Washington had until 30 June 2011 to extend Yi's contract but decided not to.\n\nOn 6 January 2012, Yi signed with the Dallas Mavericks to a one-year contract after starting the season with the Guangdong Southern Tigers. He was immediately assigned to Dallas' D-League affiliate team, the Texas Legends. Yi benefited from the new collective bargaining agreement rules which allowed players with more than two years of NBA experience to be assigned to the D-League with the players' consent. On 9 January 2012, after playing two games for the Texas Legends, averaging 23 points and 12 rebounds per game, he was recalled by Dallas. The team faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the playoffs and in Game 3 of the playoff series, Yi played in his first NBA playoffs game, where he scored two points for the team in five minutes.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, Yi signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, returning to the NBA for the first time since 2012. Lakers head coach Luke Walton considered Yi to be the team's best-shooting big man during the preseason, but did not provide Yi with much of a role. Yi averaged 3.0 points and 2.5 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game over six contests with the Lakers during the preseason. Feeling he would have better opportunities elsewhere, Yi requested a release from the Lakers prior to the start of the regular season. The Lakers waived him on October 24, 2016.\n\nYi's first major international experience came at the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which he averaged 18.9 points and 11.5 rebounds per game. He made his debut with the Chinese national basketball team during the 2004 Summer Olympics and averaged 6 points and 6 rebounds per game at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. His performance impressed coaches on the Chinese national team as well as the coaches from other countries.\n\nIn 2008, Yi was once again selected to play for the Chinese national team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. In China's first two group stage matches, Yi scored 9 and 4 points respectively, and China lost both their games against the United States and Spain. But in a win against Angola, Yi recorded a double-double, and in a win against Germany, Yi recorded 9 points and 11 rebounds, and hit the crucial shot with 28 seconds left to help China advance to the quarter-finals. However, Lithuania ended China's run by beating them 94–68, as Yi scored 11 points for his side.\n\nYi, along with former NBA player Sun Yue, was a member of the Chinese national team that played at the 2009 FIBA Asia Championship and the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. Yi was named the most valuable player of the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship, averaging 16.6 points and 10.8 rebounds per game. Yi also played for the Chinese national team during the 2012 Summer Olympics, ranking first in rebounds per game with 10.2 per game and ranking second in blocks with 2.2 per game. He also played at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nYi is fluent in both Mandarin and his native tongue of Cantonese. He was ranked fourth on \"Forbes\"' China Celebrity 100 in income and popularity in 2008. In 2008, Yi donated 100,000 yuan to support the 2008 Sichuan earthquake victims and also participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics' torch relay by carrying the torch during the Hainan leg of the relay.\n\nIn 2004, Yi was listed as being born in 1984 during the Four Nation Tournament, but Chinese officials said that it was probably a typographical error. Two years later, Fran Blinebury of \"The Houston Chronicle\" reported that Yi told Shane Battier he was 24 years old in an exhibition game before the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but the story was refuted by both Yi and Battier. Yi is not the first Chinese basketball player to come under scrutiny for age discrepancy, as former NBA player Wang Zhizhi had been listed as being born in both 1977 and 1979. In 2006, a senior Chinese official admitted that past youth squads had included players above the permitted age.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, Yi's date of birth was further scrutinized as being 27 October 1984, including a Chinese reporter discovering a high school enrollment form from 1997 that listed Yi as being born on 27 October 1984.\n\n"}
