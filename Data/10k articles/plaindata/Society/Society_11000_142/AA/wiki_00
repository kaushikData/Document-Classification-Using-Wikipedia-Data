Club premises were located in upstairs rooms previously operated by the YWCA on Grenfell Street, but soon moved to what had been Beaches Restaurant on Hindley Street, about 100 metres from King William Street. Its membership was drawn from Adelaide's business, public, professional, scientific, literary, and artistic communities, but also welcomed married women with \"home duties\". The Club was founded with 163 members, and by September 1923 had grown to 281. Membership was £1 a year, and the entrance fee 2/6. Facilities included library, drawing rooms, dressing rooms and a cafeteria. By March 1930 membership had grown to 320.\n\nThe foundation committee consisted of secretary/manager E. Gill (Eileen?), and president Adelaide Miethke, with two vice presidents Amy Tomkinson and Phebe Watson, treasurer Gertrude May Fulston JP (1893–1954), and six ordinary members. Trustees were Adelaide Miethke, Phebe Watson, Gertrude May Fulston, and Mabel Gilbert. Committee membership remained stable for many years, with Meta Buring (1875–1955) being one of the few new faces.\n\nIn 1930 a wall of their building collapsed, followed by a fire, and the committee saw this as an opportunity to move from Hindley Street to larger premises in the White Hart building, Peel Street, just around the corner; additional facilities included a bathroom, five bedrooms and a balcony. With the new premises, the Club enjoyed a surge in membership, and Mrs. Decimus Smith, née Irene France (1884–1966) was appointed business manager. Prominent members from around this time were the singer Charlotte Grivell (1901–1981) and Lady Hore-Ruthven (also known as Lady Gowrie).\n\nFor practically the whole life of the Club, Alliance Française met at the Club rooms. Other organizations to use the Club's facilities were the United Arts Club, and the National Council of Women also held their meetings at the Club, which they made their headquarters. Various Old Scholars' groups held their reunions there, as did the Advanced School for Girls for their annual bridge night, one of the last functions to be held in the clubrooms.\n\nThe Club went into recess in December 1938 and never reopened. No public announcement was made regarding its closure either before or after.\n"}
{"id": "2632086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2632086", "title": "Agnivansha", "text": "Agnivansha\n\nIn Indian culture, the Agnivanshi are people who claim descent from Agni, the Vedic god of fire. The Agnivanshi lineage (Agnivansha or Agnikula) is one of the three lineages into which the Rajput clans are divided, the others being the Suryavanshi (descended from Surya, the sun god) and the Chandravanshi (descended from Chandra, the moon god). According to medieval legends, there are four Agnivanshi clans: Chauhans (Chahamanas), Parihars (Pratiharas), Parmars (Paramaras) and Solankis (Chaulukyas).\n\nSeveral Indian communities and dynasties have legends of fire-born ancestry. Alf Hiltebeitel theorises that the fire-lineage legends signify a new class of Kshatriya warriors, as opposed to the earlier warriors who claimed descent from the solar and lunar lineages mentioned in the ancient texts. Among the clans now known as the Rajputs, the legend might have been invented by Padmagupta, a 10th-century court poet of the Paramara dynasty. His \"Nava-Sahasanka-Charita\" is the earliest source claiming an Agnivanshi origin for the Paramaras. He might have been motivated by the fact that the Paramaras were the only royal family in their region without a mythical account of heroic or divine origin. The 16th century Rajput bards might have extended the legend to include other imperial dynasties, in order to foster Rajput unity against Muslims.\n\nAmong the dynasties that are now called Rajputs, the Paramara kings of Malwa were the first to claim an \"Agnikula\" (\"fire clan\") ancestry. Several inscriptions and literary works composed during the Paramara era mention this legend. The earliest known source to mention this story is the \"Nava-sahasanka-charita\" of the Paramara court poet Padmagupta Parimala. The Sanskrit-language epic was composed during the reign of Sindhuraja (ca. 997-1010). Its version of the legend is as follows:\n\nPadmagupta's \"Nava-sahasanka-charita\" is based on the life of Sindhuraja, but is of little historical value. The legend is not mentioned in earlier Paramara inscriptions (such as the Harsola copper plates) or literary works (such as Halayudha's \"Mritasanjivani\"). Therefore, K. N. Seth concludes that Padmagupta invented the legend in late 10th century. By this time, all of the Paramaras' neighbouring dynasties claimed descent from mythical heroes or gods: the Pratiharas from Lakshmana, the Chahamanas (Chauhans) from Surya (Sun), the Chaulukyas from Brahma's water pot (\"chaluka\"), and the Chandelas from Chandra (Moon). The Paramaras were the only ones without a legend of mythical origin. This might have motivated Padmagupta to invent a new legend with Sindhuraja's approval.\n\nThe post-Sindhuraja Paramara inscriptions and literary works widely mention the Agnikula myth. The Paramara inscriptions which mention this legend include the \"Udapur Prashasti\" inscription, the Nagpur stone inscription, the Vasantagarh inscription, the Arthuna inscription of Chamundaraja, the Neminath Jain temple inscription, the Donagaragrama inscription, the Patnarayan inscription and the Jainad inscription. \"Tilaka-Manjari\" by Dhanapala, a contemporary of the Paramara king Bhoja, also supports this account.\n\nThe earliest of the Chauhan inscriptions and literary works do not claim Agnivanshi descent. These sources variously state that the dynasty's legendary founder Chahamana was born from Indra's eye, in the lineage of the sage Vatsa, in the solar dynasty and/or during a ritual sacrifice performed by Brahma.\n\nSome recensions of \"Prithviraj Raso\", an epic poem by Chand Bardai, contain a legend similar to the Paramara legend. However, this version does not present the sages Vashistha and Vishwamitra as rivals. It goes like this:\n\"Prithviraj Raso\" is the earliest source that includes four different Rajput dynasties (not just the Paramaras) in this legend. Scholars such as Dasharatha Sharma and C. V. Vaidya, who analyzed the earliest available copies of \"Prithviraj Raso\", concluded that its original recension did not contain this legend at all. The earliest extant copy of \"Prithviraj Raso\", dated to 15th century, contains only one sentence regarding the origin of Chauhan dynasty: it states that Manikya Rai was the first valiant Chauhan, and he was born from Brahma's sacrifice. R. B. Singh believes that the 16th century poets came up with the legend to foster Rajput unity against the Mughal emperor Akbar.\n\nAdaptions of the \"Prithviraj Raso\" legend occur in later works written under the patronage of the various Chauhan dynasties. One notable adaption is found in \"Hammira Raso\" (1728 CE), which describes the life of Hammira-deva, the Chauhan king of Ranthambore. It was composed by Jodharaja, a court poet of prince Chandrabhana of Neemrana. Its version of the legend is as follows:\n\nA slight variation occurs in the writings of Surya Malla Mishrana, the court poet of Bundi. In this version, the various gods create the four heroes on Vashistha's request. According to the bardic tale of the Khichi clan of Chauhans, the Parwar (Paramara) was born from Shiva's essence; the Solankhi (Solanki) or Chaluk Rao (Chaulukya) was born from Brahma's essence; the Pariyar (Parihar) was born from Devi's essence; and the Chahuvan (Chauhan) was born from the fire. The myth also appears with some variations in the Sisana inscription of the Chauhans of Bedla, and the \"Khyat\" of Nainsi.\n\n\"Dvyasraya-Mahakavya\", an account of the Chaulukya dynasty (Solankis) by Hemachandra (c. 1088-1173 CE), mentions the Agnikula legend while describing the origin of the Paramaras. The Chaulukyas knew about the Agnikula legend, but associated it with the Paramaras, not themselves.\n\nThe \"Bhavishya Purana\", some of whose portions date as late as the 19th century, also contains the legend with some variations. In this version, the Kanyakubja Brahmins conducted a sacrifice on Mount Abu to appease Brahma. The recital of the Vedic mantras produced four Kshatriya heroes: Samavedin Paramara, Yajurvedin Chahumana (Chauhan), Trivedin Shukla and Atharvavedin Parihara (Pratihara).\n\nAbu'l Fazl mentions another variation of the legend in his \"Ain-i-Akbari\": In 761 BCE, a sage called Mahabaha kindled a flame and established a fire temple, which started attracting several devotees. Later, the Buddhists, unhappy with these Brahminical rites, managed to get an order prohibiting this style of worship. The fire temple devotees then prayed to seek a hero who would overthrow Buddhism and restore their traditional faith. The \"Supreme Justice\" then conjured a hero from the now-cold fire temple. This hero, called Dhananjaya (or Dhanji), attained power in a short time and restored the Brahminical rites. He came to Malwa from Deccan, and established a government there. When his fifth-generation descendant Putaraja died childless, the nobles elected one Aditya Ponwar as his successor. The Paramara dynasty descended from Ponwar.\n\nPadmagupta's legend appears to be based on a similar story mentioned in \"Balakanda\" of the \"Ramayana\" (1:53:18 — 1:54:3). In this story, Vishvamitra (initially a Kshatriya) snatches Vashistha's Kamadhenu cow (called \"Shabala\"). With Vashistha's permission, the cow creates the non-Indo-Aryan warriors who defeat Vishvamitra's army. These warriors include the Barbaras, the Kambojas, the Pahlavas, the Shakas, and the Yavanas. The \"Mahabharata\" repeats this legend with some variations. In this version, the stolen cow (called \"Nandini\") retaliates by creating the various mleccha tribes from different parts of her body. Seeing the power of the Brahmin Vashistha, Vishvamitra decides to become a Brahmin as well.\n\nSome colonial-era historians interpreted the Agnikula myth to suggest a foreign origin for the Agnivanshi Rajputs. According to this theory, the foreign ancestors of these Rajputs came to India after the decline of the Gupta Empire around 5th century CE. They were admitted in the Hindu caste system after performing a fire ritual. James Tod, who relied on bardic legends, was the first to propose this theory. He speculated that the Agnivashi Rajputs, who were of \"good-stature and fair\", could not have descended from the \"dark, diminutive and ill-favoured\" aboriginal natives of India. He proposed that their ancestors were Scythians and other groups residing beyond the Hindu Kush mountains. A. M. T. Jackson proposed a similar theory, but argued that the Rajputs had originated from Gurjars, who according to him, came to India as part of invading hordes. The basis for his theory was the Agnivanshi myth, and the prevalence of surnames such as Pavar (Parmar) and Chavan (Chauhan) among Gurjars. The theory was further supported by other British scholars as well as some Indian scholars, such as D. R. Bhandarkar. William Crooke theorised that the demons referred to in the Agnikula legend were Buddhist rivals of the Brahmins. He argued that the Kshatriya descent was based on status rather than descent, and therefore Brahmins conducted a purification or initiation fire ritual to raise the status of foreign warriors who helped them repress the Buddhists.\n\nThe foreign-origin theory has been criticised by several later scholars. Alf Hiltebeitel states that the colonial historians saw the foreign-origin theory as a way of justifying their own colonial invasion. R. B. Singh criticises Indian supporters of the theory for having failed to see the \"subtle game\" of the colonial historians.\n\nHiltebeitel argues that the \"Ramayana\" story cannot be the origin of the Agnikula myth, because it has nothing to do with birth from fire. There are other mythological legends involving sages and birth of warriors, which do not support the foreign-origin theory. For example, the \"Ramayana\" also mentions that Vashistha and Rishyasringa performed a ceremony that resulted in the birth of Rama and his three brothers. The \"Pratisarga-Parvan\" of \"Bhavishya Purana\" mentions a legend according to which the Brahmins destroyed the mlecchas by pulling them into a sacrificial fire pit (rather than creating them from it). Besides, the fire-origin legend is not unique to the Rajputs. There are several south Indian legends of fire-born dynasties and communities:\n\n\nHiltebeitel notes that the common theme among all these \"fire-origin\" legends is not the theft of a cow: rather, it is the creation of a new order of Kshatriyas (as opposed to the traditional solar and lunar Kshatriyas mentioned in the ancient sources). Hiltebeitel further theorises that the Agnikula myth is of south Indian origin, and may have been transmitted to northern India by the feudatories of the Pallavas and the Chalukyas. He suggests that the Tamil-language \"Silappatikaram\" legend is \"an Agnikula myth waiting to be realized\". It mentions solar and lunar ancestry of the Cholas and Pandyas respectively, but remains silent on the ancestry of the Cheras. According to a legend in this text, after the destruction of the Chola and the Pandya capitals (the latter by \"agni\" or fire), it is the Chera king who redeems the royals by establishing the worship of Kannagi. Besides the south Indian legends of fire-origin, Hiltebeitel also connects the Chaulukyas (Solanki Rajputs) to the south Indian Chalukyas of Kalyani in his support. Before the popularisation of the Agnikula myth, both these dynasties claimed origin from Brahma's \"chaluka\" (folded palm or water-pot). The Guhilot Rajputs of Mewar as well as the Chaulukyas of Gujarat are known to have employed Brahmins from Deccan for fabricating their myths of origin. D. C. Sircar also suggested that the Paramara court poet Padmagupta might also have been a native of southern India. According to Paramara inscriptions, his patron Vakpati Munja had achieved military successes in southern India.\n\nAccording to K. N. Seth, the foreign-origin theory is weakened by the fact that the Agnikula legend is not mentioned in the earliest of the Paramara records (such as the Harsola copper plates). Moreover, the earliest Paramara-era accounts do not mention the other Rajput clans as fire-born. The early Chauhan dynasties were centered around Ajmer-Pushkar region, and their association with Mount Abu is a later invention.\n\nR. B. Singh argues that if the ancestors of Rajputs were the Indo-Aryan natives of north-western India, Tod's claim of stark differences between the appearances of the Scythians and the natives is misleading, as both the groups have Indo-European origins.\n\nNotes\nCitations\n"}

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report states that greenhouse gas forcing is largely, but not wholly, responsible for the decline in Arctic sea ice extent. A study from 2011 suggested that internal variability enhanced the greenhouse gas forced sea ice decline over the last decades. A study from 2007 found the decline to be \"faster than forecasted\" by model simulations. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report concluded with high confidence that sea ice continues to decrease in extent, and that there is robust evidence for the downward trend in Arctic summer sea ice extent since 1979. It has been established that the region is at its warmest for at least 40,000 years and the Arctic-wide melt season has lengthened at a rate of 5 days per decade (from 1979 to 2013), dominated by a later autumn freezeup. Sea ice changes have been identified as a mechanism for polar amplification.\n\nThe Arctic Ocean is the mass of water positioned approximately above latitude 65° N. Arctic Sea Ice refers to the area of the Arctic Ocean covered in ice. The \"Arctic sea ice minimum\" is the day in a given year when Arctic sea ice reaches its smallest extent. It occurs at the end of the summer melting season, normally during September. \"Arctic Sea ice maximum\" is the day of a year when Arctic sea ice reaches its largest extent near the end of the Arctic cold season, normally during March. Typical data visualizations for Arctic sea ice include average monthly measurements or graphs for the annual minimum or maximum extent, as shown in the adjacent images.\n\nAn article in Popular Mechanics, published in March 1912, described open waters in the Arctic regions in 1911, a year with exceptional above average temperatures.\n\nObservation with satellites show that Arctic sea ice area, extent, and volume have been in decline for a few decades. Sometime during the 21st century, sea ice may effectively cease to exist during the summer. Sea ice extent is defined as the area with at least 15% ice cover. The amount of multi-year sea ice in the Arctic has declined considerably in recent decades. In 1988, ice that was at least 4 years old accounted for 26% of the Arctic's sea ice. By 2013, ice that age was only 7% of all Arctic sea ice.\n\nScientists recently measured sixteen-foot (five-meter) wave heights during a storm in the Beaufort Sea in mid-August until late October 2012. This is a new phenomenon for the region, since a permanent sea ice cover normally prevents wave formation. Wave action breaks up sea ice, and thus could become a feedback mechanism, driving sea ice decline.\n\nFor January 2016, the satellite based data showed the lowest overall Arctic sea ice extent of any January since records begun in 1979. Bob Henson from Wunderground noted:\nThe January 2016's remarkable phase transition of Arctic oscillation was driven by a rapid tropospheric warming in the Arctic, a pattern that appears to have increased surpassing the so-called stratospheric sudden warming. The previous record of the lowest area of the Arctic Ocean covered by ice in 2012 saw a low of 1.58 million square miles (4.1 million square kilometers). This replaced the previous record set on September 28, 2007 at 1.61 million square miles(4.17 million square kilometers).\n\nAn \"ice-free\" Arctic Ocean is often defined as \"having less than 1 million square kilometers of sea ice\", because it is very difficult to melt the thick ice around the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The IPCC AR5 defines \"nearly ice-free conditions\" as sea ice extent less than 10 km for at least five consecutive years.\n\nMany scientists have attempted to estimate when the Arctic will be \"ice-free\". Professor Peter Wadhams of the University of Cambridge is among these scientists. Wadhams and several others have noted that climate model predictions have been overly conservative regarding sea ice decline. A 2013 paper suggested that models commonly underestimate the solar radiation absorption characteristics of wildfire soot. A 2006 paper predicted \"near ice-free September conditions by 2040\".\"Overland and Wang\" (2013) investigated three different ways of predicting future sea ice levels. From sea ice models and recent satellite images it can be expected that a sea ice free summer will come before 2020. The IPCC AR5 (for at least one scenario) estimates an ice-free summer might occur around 2050. The Third U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), released May 6, 2014, reports that the Arctic Ocean is expected to be ice free in summer before mid-century. Models that best match historical trends project a nearly ice-free Arctic in the summer by the 2030s. However, these models do tend to underestimate the rate of sea ice loss since 2007. Based on the outcomes of several different models, \"Overland and Wang\" (2013) putthe early limit for a sea ice free summer Arctic near 2040.\n\nWarming Arctic temperatures provide a powerful forcing toward lessened sea ice coverage\n\nThere is an ongoing debate if the Arctic Ocean has already passed a \"tipping point\", defined as a threshold for abrupt and irreversible change. A 2013 study identified an abrupt transition to increased seasonal ice cover variability in 2007, which has persisted in following years. The researchers made a distinction between a bifurcation and a non-bifurcation `tipping point'. The \"IPCC AR5\" report stated with medium confidence that precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger a tipping point remain uncertain, and that the risk associated with crossing multiple tippingpoints increases with rising temperature.\n\nDark, open water left behind as sea ice melts absorbs vastly more heat than ice covered water, leading to physical implications that include the ice-albedo feedback or warmer sea surface temperatures which increase ocean heat content. As Peter Wadhams, a polar researcher writes \"once summer ice yields to open water, the albedo... drops from 0.6 to 0.1, which will further accelerate warming of the Arctic and of the whole planet.\" This warming has increased to such an extent that the poles are heating approximately twice as fast as the global average, according to Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis. Economical implications of ice free summers and the decline in Arctic ice volumes include a greater number of journeys across the Arctic Ocean Shipping lanes during the year. This number has grown from 0, in 1979 to 400–500 along the Bering strait and >40 along the Northern Sea Route, in 2013.\n\nThe polar vortex is a whirlwind of especially cold, dense air forming near the poles that is contained by the jet stream, a belt of fast-flowing winds that serves as a boundary between cold polar air and the warmer air of other hemispheres. Because the power of the polar vortex and jet stream is derived partly from the temperature contrast between cold polar air and warmer tropical air, it is at risk of becoming severely diminished as this contrast is eroded by the effects of melting sea ice. According to the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences ”there [has been] a significant change in the vortex mean state over the twenty-first century, resulting in a weaker, more disturbed vortex.\" As the vortex becomes weaker, it is more likely to allow cold arctic air to escape from the confines of the jet stream and spill over into other hemispheres. This disruption has already begun to affect global temperatures. In a 2017 study conducted by climatologist Dr. Judah Cohen and several of his research associates, Cohen wrote that “[the] shift in polar vortex states can account for \"most\" of the recent winter cooling trends over Eurasian midlatitudes”\n\nMelting of sea ice releases molecular chlorine, which reacts with sunlight to produce chlorine atoms. Because chlorine atoms are highly reactive, they can expedite the degradation of methane and tropospheric ozone and the oxidation of mercury to more toxic forms. Cracks in sea ice are causing ozone and mercury uptake in the surrounding environment.\n\nA 2015 study concluded that Arctic sea ice decline accelerates methane emissions from the Arctic tundra. One of the study researchers noted, \"The expectation is that with further sea ice decline, temperatures in the Arctic will continue to rise, and so will methane emissions from northern wetlands.\"\n\nA link has been proposed between reduced Barents-Kara sea ice and cold winter extremes over northern continents. Model simulation suggest diminished Arctic sea ice may have been a contributing driver of recent wet summers over northern Europe, because of a weakened jet stream, which dives further south. Extreme summer weather in northern mid-latitudes has been linked to a vanishing cryosphere. Evidence suggest that the continued loss of Arctic sea-ice and snow cover may influence weather at lower latitudes. Correlations have been identified between high-latitude cryosphere changes, hemispheric wind patterns and mid-latitude extreme weather events for the Northern Hemisphere. A study from 2004, connected the disappearing sea ice with a reduction of available water in the American west.\n\nBased on effects of Arctic amplification (warming) and ice loss, a study in 2015 concluded that highly amplified jet-stream patterns are occurring more frequently in the past two decades, and that such patterns can not be tied to certain seasons. Additionally it was found that these jet-stream patterns often lead to persistent weather patterns that result in extreme weather events. Hence, continued heat trapping emissions favour increased formation of extreme events caused by prolonged weather conditions.\n\nIn 2018, climate scientist Michael E. Mann explained that the west Antarctic ice sheet may lose twice as much ice by the end of the century as previously thought, which also doubles the projected rise in sea level from three feet to more than six feet.\n\nSea ice decline has been linked to boreal forest decline in North America and is assumed to culminate with an intensifying wildfire regime in this region.\nThe annual net primary production of the Eastern Bering Sea was enhanced by 40–50% through phytoplankton blooms during warm years of early sea ice retreat.\n\nPolar bears are turning to alternate food sources because Arctic sea ice melts earlier and freezes later each year. As a result, they have less time to hunt their historically preferred prey of seal pups, and must spend more time on land and hunt other animals. As a result, the diet is less nutritional, which leads to reduced body size and reproduction, thus indicating population decline in polar bears.\n\nMelting Arctic ice caps are likely to increase traffic through the Arctic Ocean. An early study by James Hansen and colleagues suggested in 1981 that warming of 5 to 10 °C, which they expected as the range of Arctic temperature change corresponding to doubled concentrations, could open the Northwest Passage. A 2016 study concludes that Arctic warming and sea ice decline will lead to \"remarkable shifts in trade flows between Asia and Europe, diversion of trade within Europe, heavy shipping traffic in the Arctic and a substantial drop in Suez traffic. Projected shifts in trade also imply substantial pressure on an already threatened Arctic ecosystem.\" In August 2017, the first ship traversed the Northern Sea Route without the use of ice-breakers. Also in 2017, the Finnish icebreaker MSV Nordica, set a record for the earliest crossing of the Northwest Passage. According to the \"New York Times\", this forebodes more shipping through the Arctic, as the sea ice melts and makes shipping easier. A 2016 report by the Copenhagen Business School found that large-scale trans-Arctic shipping will become economically viable by 2040.\n\n\n"}

B-girls were employed by bars in the US during the 1940s and 1950s. In her memoirs Maya Angelou describes working as a B-girl in a San Francisco strip club in the 1950s.\n\nIn addition to entertaining customers individually, bargirls in some venues (such as strip clubs in the United States, or go-go bars in Asia) are expected to dance on stage, often in skimpy costumes such as bikinis, semi-nude, or nude.\n\nBargirls often receive a commission on drinks bought by their customers. Where applicable, they may receive a percentage of the escort fee or bar fine paid by any customer who wishes to take them out of the bar. In other cases, they may have a periodic quota of drinks or bar fines, or both.\n\nSome bargirls also act as prostitutes, either on-site (with the bar effectively acting as a brothel) or by being hired upon payment of a bar fine. This practice is especially common in Asia. In South Korea, \"juicy bars\" near the gates of United States military bases provide prostitutes for soldiers.\n\nWhere bargirls act as prostitutes, patterns vary widely. Some seek to have as many customers as possible in a given day; these women generally take only \"short-time\" clients. Others are more selective and accept only one customer per day, taking \"long-time\" customers overnight or even for a few days.\n\nA \"bar fine\" is a payment made by a customer to the operators of a bar that allows a dancer, hostess, or some other employee of that bar to leave work early, usually in order to accompany the customer outside the bar. Although it is not universal, this practice is frequently associated with venues offering prostitution to foreigners—especially in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nWorking conditions vary both between and within countries; even within individual countries, conditions can vary widely between venues. For example, there is significant variation among establishments in Thailand's red-light district in Pattaya. Some bars employ relatively well-paid women who live outside the bar, while others employ lower-paid women who live at the bar.\n\nIn some countries prostitution is treated as a serious crime; in the Philippines it is covered by the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003. In Thailand, and in many other countries where bar fine prostitution is common, it is technically illegal but widely tolerated.\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibits American military personnel from purchasing bar fines, which is an offense considered equal to buying the services of a prostitute.\n\nB-girl activity has declined in the U.S. (so much so that female breakdancers now refer to themselves as B-girls), but it still occurs. Because prostitution is illegal in most parts of the U.S. and is restricted to licensed brothels in those parts of Nevada where it is legal, B-girls who act as prostitutes are breaking the law. The practice of accepting drinks for pay is specifically outlawed in many localities. \n\nBars have been raided and closed down for \"B-girl activity.\" In one 1962 case, nightclub owners suspected of having ties to a Chicago crime syndicate were brought before the Senate Rackets Committee. The \"Boston Globe\" reported that \"one of [the syndicate's] rackets, according to testimony, is the operation of cheap nightclubs which use B-girls to solicit watered-down drinks at high prices from customers, or even engage in prostitution with them.\"\n\nIt was once common for modestly dressed B-girls to pose as secretaries who had stopped at the bar for a drink on their way home from work. The male customer, under the impression that he had found a \"date\" for the evening, would buy her one expensive drink after another, only to be jilted afterwards.\n\nIn 2014, city officials in Kenner, Louisiana, where the practice is illegal, replaced the word \"B-girl\" with \"B-drinker\" in their liquor laws to avoid gender discrimination.\n\nMarilyn Monroe was nominated for a Golden Globe award for her role as a B-girl in \"Bus Stop\" (1956). In the film, Monroe's character, Chérie, consumes four tea-and-sodas before her companion catches on.\n\nB-girls are referenced in the fourth season \"M*A*S*H\" episode \"Deluge\".\n\n\n"}

The related term \"Boerehater\" () has been used to describe a person who hates, prejudices or criticises Boers or Afrikaners.\n\nThese terms were initially applied to British people perceived as prejudiced against the Boers, in the context of political conflict between the British and the Boers in southern Africa which culminated in the British defeat of the Boers in the Second Boer War. Accusations of \"Boerehaat\" have subsequently been made by Afrikaner nationalists to exploit historical British prejudice against the Boers for political gain. They have applied the term \"Boerehater\" to anyone who criticised them or opposed their interests in the Cape Colony, including English-speaking white South Africans, dissident Afrikaners and black South Africans.\n\n\"Boerehaat\" is an Afrikaans word meaning hatred of the Boers, or Afrikaners as they became known after the Second Boer War. The related term \"Boerehater\" () has been used to describe a person who hates, prejudices or criticises the Boers, or Afrikaners.\n\nThe disdain of the British people for the Boers was recorded as early as the 18th century. The Boers were portrayed to the British public in literature and editorial cartoons as uncivilised and cruel, especially in order to obtain the support of the British public for British imperialism and the Second Boer War. The English term \"Boer-hater\" was used in a political context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.\n\nBritish politician James Bryce, writing about the attitude of uitlanders (English-speaking immigrants) towards the Boer authorities in the independent Transvaal Republic during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush following the discovery of gold in 1886, states: \"English became the general spoken tongue not only of Johannesburg, but of the mining districts generally. Hearing nothing but English spoken, seeing nothing all round them that was not far more English than Dutch, though English with a half-colonial, half-American tinge, it was natural that the bulk of the Uitlanders should deem themselves to be in a country which had become virtually English, and should see something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors.\" British critic of imperialism John A. Hobson writes about attitudes towards senior Boer officials: \"Regarding the higher officials, the opinion of all, save the blind Boer-hater, is that they are a fairly competent and fairly honest body of men.\"\n\nAnimosity between the British and the Boers intensified in the run-up to the Second Boer War fought from 1899 to 1902, and continued thereafter. One British volunteer soldier sent home a letter explicitly detailing the British soldiers' hatred of their Boer enemy: \"The Cape Dutch and Boers are a dirty treacherous lot and as soon as the Transvaal is subdued and the beggars (those that survive) trek farther out of our way the better. We do hate them down here like poison. The rascally dirty varmints, they must be exterminated; the country swarms with them and their dirty compatriots the German Jew.\"\n\nApproximately 27,000 Boer women and children died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners. The British won the war, but anti-British sentiment contributed to the rise of Afrikaner nationalism and the pro-Afrikaner National Party was the ruling party of South Africa from 1948 until 1994, the apartheid era.\n\nDuring the apartheid era, the Afrikaners dominated in number of voters, politics and civil service, while English-speaking white South Africans dominated economically. The Afrikaners separated themselves from the rest of the population, both black people and English-speaking whites. In 1971 sociologist Heribert Adam writes \"the historical friction between the English and Afrikaans-speaking populace is gradually being replaced by class contradictions within the two groups.\" Historical friction was revived and exploited by the ruling National Party for political gain however. In 1973 Edward Feit, professor of political science at the University of Michigan, writes in the \"American Journal of Sociology\": \"Recent political campaigns have shown that the old bogey of \"Boerehaat\" still has its charms for an Afrikaaner majority.\"\n\nThe National Party, under the leadership of B. J. Vorster, appealed to the emotions of Afrikaner voters by depicting English-speaking white citizens as being guilty of \"Boerehaat\". The National Party and its political mouthpiece \"Die Burger\" waged a \"Boerehaat campaign\" during a by-election in Oudtshoorn in 1972, depicting their United Party opposition, once supported by the majority of English-speaking voters, as \"Boerehaters\", and won. The Nationalists also used the term to censure members of the Progressive Federal Party opposition party formed in 1977. After interviewing various South Africans including government officials during the early 1980s, American historian Otto Scott writes: \"This sort of xenophobic solidarity perceived the opposition as Boer haters.\"\n\nWhite South African critics of apartheid, such as liberal politician Alex Boraine and Afrikaner anti-apartheid activist Beyers Naudé, were labelled unpatriotic \"Boerehaters\" by Nationalists and the Afrikaans press in an attempt to discredit them. White dissidents were also associated with the \"rooi gevaar\" (\"communist threat\"). South African poet and writer Guy Butler was called a \"Boerehater\" by Afrikaners for his promotion of English-language literature and his opposition to Afrikaner nationalism and the National Party.\n\nEnglish-speaking film critics were more lenient towards Afrikaans-language films lest they be accused of \"Boerehaat\". According to \"The Star\" film critic Robert Greig, \"An apology situation developed with the English-language newspapers who tended not to slam Afrikaans films because they didn't want to be accused of \"boerehaat\" (Boer-hater).\" According to film critic Barry Ronge, \"The cries of \"boerehaat\" come from the industry itself when they feel they are not getting 'support'.\"\n\nIn 1995 ANC politician Zola Skweyiya was accused of \"Boerehaat\" by \"Die Burger\" for disrespecting the Afrikaans official language in Parliament. In 1998 Jaap Marais, Afrikaner nationalist leader of the right-wing Herstigte Nasionale Party, described the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission as an exercise in \"Boerehaat\".\n\nIn 2011 South African politician Julius Malema was found guilty of hate speech in the High Court in Johannesburg for repeatedly singing the anti-apartheid protest song \"Shoot the Boer\" at political gatherings. Civil rights organisation AfriForum accused Malema of inciting violence against white South Africans, citing the ongoing spate of farm attacks (the literal meaning of \"Boer\" is \"farmer\"). Judge Colin Lamont ruled that Malema's singing of the song in a post-apartheid South Africa was \"derogatory, dehumanising and hurtful\" to the Afrikaner minority group. Lamont said \"People must develop new customs and rejoice in a developing society by giving up old practices which are hurtful to members who live in that society with them.\"\n\nIn an incident reminiscent of the National Party's \"Boerehaat\" propaganda campaign during apartheid, ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa urged disgruntled residents of the Limpopo province to vote in the 2014 general election otherwise \"the Boers will come back to control us\". Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder described his remarks as \"primitive scare tactics\" and \"racist and polarising\".\n\nSociologist Michael Neocosmos notes that critics of the ruling ANC can similarly be labelled as \"standing outside the state-defined national consensus\", with for example \"ad hominem\" accusations of racism and disloyalty replacing accusations of \"Boerehaat\" and communist sympathies which are hard to defend.\n\n"}

They are primarily located in two municipalities near Serbia's border with Bulgaria: in Bosilegrad there are 5,839 Bulgarians i.e. 71.9% of population while in Dimitrovgrad (Tsaribrod) there are 5,413 Bulgarians or 53.5% of population.\n\nThe dominant religion among ethnic Bulgarians in Serbia is Orthodoxy. Islam never arrived in areas like Bosilegrad because of the mountainous terrain and most inhabitants dwelled in high mountain villages where they were hard to reach. They use both Serbian and Bulgarian churches due to the low number of \nBulgarian clergymen present in the region. There is a church in every village around Bosilegrad, and the oldest ones date to the 11th century.\n\nThe regional names once used by many people in the Torlakian-speaking region was \"Torlaci\" and \"Šopi\" speaking a transitional speech between Bulgarian and Serbian. The borders of the region frequently shifted before the Ottoman conquest among Byzantine, Bulgarian and Serbian rulers. According to some authors during the Ottoman rule, the majority of native Torlakian Slavic population did not have distinct national consciousness in ethnic sense. The first known literary monument, influenced by Torlakian dialects is the Manuscript from Temska Monastery from 1762, in which its author, the Monk Kiril Zhivkovich from Pirot, considered his language as: \"simple Bulgarian\".\n\nA Silesian traveler stated in 1596 that the road of his trip from Sofia to Niš was filled with corpses and described the gates of Niš as standing in front of freshly beheaded heads of poor Bulgarian peasants by the Ottoman army. The Pirot Rebellion broke out in 1836, followed by the Niš rebellion in 1836, which also included Pirot. According to Ottoman statistics during the Tanzimat the greater part of the population up to the Sanjak of Niš was treated as Bulgarian. According to all authors between 1840-72 the delineation between Bulgarians and Serbs is undisputed and ran north of Nis. The Serbian researchers (such as Dimitrije Davidovic in 1828 and Milan Savić in 1878) also accepted Bulgarian Morava river as such delineation and added Niš outside the borders of the Serbian people. It was also stipulated the area to be ceded to Bulgaria according to the Constantinople Conference in 1876 and most of it according to the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878. From 1870 until then the area was part of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, before that the area had been under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć.\n\nFollowing World War I, four territories, now known to the Bulgarian community as the Western Outlands, passed to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes from Bulgaria as a war indemnity, and the remains of the old border can be seen at Vlasina lake. In the Interwar Period, the Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation, countering Yugoslav rule in the region, was engaged in repeated attacks against the Yugoslav police and army. During World War II Bulgaria retook the Western Outlands, as well as Pirot and Vranje. After the Second World War, these regions were returned to Yugoslavia. After Serbia's independence, these areas remained within Serbia.\n\n\n"}

While the term was traditionally applied to all Circassians before Soviet times, it has since usually referred only to the Circassians living in northern Karachay-Cherkessia, a federal subject of Russia, where they are indigenous and formed just under 12% of the population in 2010. These Circassians are mostly Besleney Kabardians who speak the Cherkess, i.e. Circassian, language. They also inhabit the villages of Khodz, Blechepsin, Koshekhabl and Ulyap in nearby Adygeya.\n\nThe Cherkess generally call themselves \"\" (), as do most Circassians. The name of the Cherkess was given to Cherkessk, formerly called Batalpashinskaya, the capital of Karachay-Cherkessia.\n\nThe Cherkess (in the narrow sense) migrated from Kabarda between 1780 and 1825, settling in the upper Zelenchuks and Urup valleys, from which they were largely displaced during the period of the 1830–1850s. During the 19th century, due to pressure from the Russia, many Cherkess moved to the Middle Eastern countries, where they largely assimilated, while still living there as a distinguishable minority. Most Cherkess have converted to Islam.\n\nThe political history of the Cherkess since the Russian Revolutions of 1917 is complex. A Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast was created on 12 January 1922. It was split into Karachay Autonomous Oblast and Cherkess National Okrug on 26 April 1926. The Cherkess National District was elevated to an autonomous oblast status on 30 April 1928. This Cherkess Autonomous Oblast existed until 9 January 1957, when it was incorporated into the Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast in its former borders following the rehabilitation of the Karachay (whom Stalin had had deported to Central Asia in 1943).\n\nOn 3 July 1991, the autonomous oblast was elevated to the status of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia (under the jurisdiction of the Russian SFSR). With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, the various peoples of Karachay-Cherkessia proclaimed their own polities including, on 27 October 1991, the Cherkessia Republic. Russia was prepared to accept division of the territory, but a 28 March 1992 referendum saw a majority of the population vote against separation, and on 9 December 1992, the words \"Autonomous Soviet Socialist\" was dropped from the name and it became the Karachay-Cherkess Republic.\n\n"}

{"id": "14564808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14564808", "title": "Christian atheism", "text": "Christian atheism\n\nChristian atheism is a form of cultural Christianity and ethics system drawing its beliefs and practices from Jesus' life and teachings as recorded in the New Testament Gospels and other sources, whilst rejecting supernatural claims of Christianity.\n\nChristian atheism takes many forms: some Christian atheists take a theological position in which the belief in the transcendent or interventionist God is rejected or absent in favor of finding God totally in the world (Thomas J. J. Altizer) while others follow Jesus in a godless world (William Hamilton). Hamilton's Christian atheism is similar to Jesuism.\n\nThomas Ogletree, Frederick Marquand Professor of Ethics and Religious Studies at Yale Divinity School, lists these four common beliefs:\n\nAccording to Paul van Buren, a Death of God theologian, the word God itself is \"either meaningless or misleading\". Van Buren contends that it is impossible to think about God and says: We cannot identify anything which will count for or against the truth of our statements concerning 'God'. The inference from these claims to the \"either meaningless or misleading\" conclusion is implicitly premised on the verificationist theory of meaning.\n\nMost Christian atheists believe that God never existed, but there are a few who believe in the death of God literally. Thomas J. J. Altizer is a well-known Christian atheist who is known for his literal approach to the death of God. He often speaks of God's death as a redemptive event. In his book \"The Gospel of Christian Atheism\", he says: Every man today who is open to experience knows that God is absent, but only the Christian knows that God is dead, that the death of God is a final and irrevocable event and that God's death has actualized in our history a new and liberated humanity. \n\nTheologians including Altizer and Lyas looked at the scientific, empirical culture of today and tried to find religion's place in it. In Altizer's words: No longer can faith and the world exist in mutual isolation…the radical Christian condemns all forms of faith that are disengaged with the world. He goes on to say that our response to atheism should be one of \"acceptance and affirmation\". Colin Lyas, a Philosophy lecturer at Lancaster University, stated: Christian atheists are united also in the belief that any satisfactory answer to these problems must be an answer that will make life tolerable in this world, here and now and which will direct attention to the social and other problems of this life. \n\nThomas Altizer has said: [T]he radical Christian believes that the ecclesiastical tradition has ceased to be Christian. \n\nAltizer believed that orthodox Christianity no longer had any meaning to people because it did not discuss Christianity within the context of contemporary theology. Christian atheists want to be completely separated from most orthodox Christian beliefs and biblical traditions. Altizer states that a faith will not be completely pure if it is open to modern culture. This faith \"can never identify itself with an ecclesiastical tradition or with a given doctrinal or ritual form\". He goes on to say that faith cannot \"have any final assurance as to what it means to be a Christian\". Altizer said: \"We must not, he says, seek for the sacred by saying 'no' to the radical profanity of our age, but by saying 'yes' to it\". They see religions which withdraw from the world as moving away from truth. This is part of the reason why they see the existence of God as counter-progressive. Altizer wrote of God as the enemy to man because mankind could never reach its fullest potential while God existed. He went on to state that \"to cling to the Christian God in our time is to evade the human situation of our century and to renounce the inevitable suffering which is its lot\".\n\nAlthough Jesus is still a central feature of Christian atheism, Hamilton said that to the Christian atheist, Jesus as an historical or supernatural figure is not the foundation of faith; instead, Jesus is a \"place to be, a standpoint\". Christian atheists look to Jesus as an example of what a Christian should be, but they do not see him as God, nor as the Son of God; merely as an influential rabbi.\n\nHamilton wrote that following Jesus means being \"alongside the neighbor, being for him\" and that to follow Jesus means to be human, to help other humans, and to further humankind.\n\nOther Christian atheists such as Thomas Altizer preserve the divinity of Jesus, arguing that through him God negates God's transcendence of being.\n\nIn the Netherlands, 42% of the members of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (PKN) are nontheists. Non-belief among clergymen is not always perceived as a problem. Some follow the tradition of \"Christian non-realism\", most famously expounded in the United Kingdom by Don Cupitt in the 1980s, which holds that God is a symbol or metaphor and that religious language is not matched by a transcendent reality. According to an investigation of 860 pastors in seven Dutch Protestant denominations, 1 in 6 clergy are either agnostic or atheist. In one of those denominations, the Remonstrant Brotherhood, the number of doubters was 42 percent. A minister of the PKN, Klaas Hendrikse has described God as \"a word for experience, or human experience\" and said that Jesus may have never existed. Hendrikse gained attention with his book published in November 2007 in which he said that it was not necessary to believe in God's existence in order to believe in God. The Dutch title of the book translates as \"Believing in a God Who Does Not Exist: Manifesto of An Atheist Pastor\". Hendrikse writes in the book that \"God is for me not a being but a word for what can happen between people. Someone says to you, for example, 'I will not abandon you', and then makes those words come true. It would be perfectly alright to call that [relationship] God\". A General Synod found Hendrikse's views were widely shared among both clergy and church members. The February 3, 2010 decision to allow Hendrikse to continue working as a pastor followed the advice of a regional supervisory panel that the statements by Hendrikse \"are not of sufficient weight to damage the foundations of the Church. The ideas of Hendrikse are theologically not new, and are in keeping with the liberal tradition that is an integral part of our church\", the special panel concluded.\n\nA Harris Interactive survey from 2003 found that 90% of self-identified Protestants in the United States believe in God and about 4% of American Protestants believe there is no God.\n\nCatholic atheism is a belief in which the culture, traditions, rituals and norms of Catholicism are accepted, but the existence of God is rejected. It is illustrated in Miguel de Unamuno's novel \"San Manuel Bueno, Mártir\" (1930). According to research in 2007, only 27% of Catholics in the Netherlands considered themselves theist while 55% were ietsist or agnostic deist and 17% were agnostic or atheist. Many Dutch people still affiliate with the term \"Catholic\" and use it within certain traditions as a basis of their cultural identity, rather than as a religious identity. The vast majority of the Catholic population in the Netherlands is now largely irreligious in practice.\n\nIn his book \"Mere Christianity\", the apologist C. S. Lewis objected to Hamilton's version of Christian atheism and the claim that Jesus was merely a moral guide:\nI am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. [...] Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.\n\nLewis's argument, now known as Lewis's trilemma, has been criticized for, among other things, constituting a false trilemma. Philosopher John Beversluis argues that Lewis \"deprives his readers of numerous alternate interpretations of Jesus that carry with them no such odious implications\".\n\n\n\n"}

The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters' defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the CIO's expulsion of the unions in which they held the most influence in 1950. After the expulsion of the Communists, organized labor in the United States began a steady decline.\n\nHistorians disagree why the union movement never formed a labor party and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in any numbers in the last ninety years. Some have argued that a strain of American exceptionalism made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized class struggle; others have attributed the left's failure to its own successes in building strong unions, but at the cost of downplaying its own political and social agendas for the sake of unity or short-term gains. Others take just the opposite position: that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by its ideological zig-zags. The CP's history within the labor movement can support all of these theses.\n\nThe Communist Party of the USA was founded in 1919, out of two groups who broke from the Socialist Party of America when it refused to join the Comintern. The original core of the CP believed that the triumph of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia meant that the revolution was at hand in the West as well.\n\nThe CP's initial attitude towards unions reflected that millenarian view. At the time of its founding, according to a leader of the party, \"it would have been difficult to gather a half dozen delegates who knew anything about the trade union movement.\" The Party also became a largely clandestine organization during the immediate post-war years, as the Palmer Raids led to the arrest and deportation of thousands of Party members.\n\nThe CP at that time looked on the American Federation of Labor as an enemy to be destroyed in order to eliminate the temptations of reformism rather than revolution. They also looked down on most trade union activities as insufficiently revolutionary: even though the labor movement was engaged in a great wave of strikes in 1919, including a general strike in Seattle, Washington, the Party's members had no role in them. Instead they urged workers to put aside their short-term economic goals and to concentrate on overthrowing the state.\n\nThe Profintern, or \"Red International of Labor Unions,\" forced the CP to change in 1921, when it directed U.S. communists to work within the AFL in order to make it a revolutionary body – what an earlier generation of SP members referred to as \"boring from within.\" In order to accomplish this, the Profintern recognized the Trade Union Educational League, an organization founded by William Z. Foster, as its U.S. affiliate.\n\nFoster had been, prior to his agreement to bring the TUEL under the wing of the CP, a syndicalist, who believed that workers would seize power through workers' organizations, such as unions, rather than through political organizations, such as a communist party. He had led the AFL's failed 1919 strike in the steel industry and had established particularly close relations then with John Fitzpatrick, the President of the Chicago Federation of Labor.\n\nTUEL functioned within existing unions, trying to organize support for industrial unionism, a labor party, organizing the unorganized and the Soviet Union. TUEL strove to create alliances with leaders who shared some of its agenda, while trying to build a base for left unionism at the local level.\n\nAfter some organizational successes, however, TUEL managed to alienate Fitzpatrick, leaving them without major allies when the AFL denounced TUEL as a \"dual union\" and expelled TUEL members in 1924. The CPUSA lost more allies when, under orders from the Comintern, it withdrew its previous enthusiastic support for the Progressive Party candidacy of Robert La Follette, Sr. for President in 1924.\n\nThe CP, on the other hand, had some short-lived successes in the labor movement without the TUEL's help. The CP had broad support in the early 1920s among the radical, largely immigrant, garment workers in New York City. A number of CP members won leadership positions in three major International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) locals in New York City in 1924 and offices in other locals in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. They held on to those offices despite the attempts by the Socialist leadership of the ILGWU to oust them.\n\nBut in 1926 the left leadership in New York forfeited everything they had when they lost a strike of 40,000 cloakmakers. The local union leadership lost the strike in large part because of the internal factionalism within the CP: when the union had the opportunity to settle on terms that were less than what the union had demanded, the union's leaders went to the CP for approval of the deal. But the Party's fraction within the union was reluctant to accept it, afraid that this would open them up to charges of softness in intra-Party factional warfare. The strike dragged on another few months, at which point the locals accepted an inferior agreement.\n\nThat gave the International union the opportunity it needed: the Socialist leadership of the ILGWU took over the exhausted locals after they settled and their supporters were too dispirited to resist. While the CP retained a strong base of support in the smaller Fur Workers Union, it never recovered from its defeat in the much larger garment industry; on the contrary, the ILGWU, led by David Dubinsky for the next forty years, remained resolutely anti-communist thereafter.\n\nThe TUEL itself changed for brief period into the dual union that the AFL had accused it of being. The TUEL led a strike of woolen industry workers in Passaic, New Jersey in 1926 — until, that is, the Comintern instructed the Party later that year to abandon any independent unions it had formed on the ground that these represented ultra-left adventurism. The strike, which would probably have been lost in any case, ended six months later in defeat after the AFL's United Textile Workers took over leadership of the strike.\n\nThe Comintern's repudiation of dual unionism in 1926 turned out, however, to be only a temporary change in policy; in 1928 the CP began establishing new CP-led unions in the coal, textile, food and garment industries and renamed the TUEL the Trade Union Unity League in 1929. This change in policy coincided with Stalin's turn to the left as he moved against his former ally Nikolai Bukharin. CP leaders, such as Foster, willing to make the switch, held on to their positions in the Party, while those who did not, such as Jay Lovestone, were expelled.\n\nThe CP's Third Period stance towards unions was nearly as ultra-left as its position in 1919 through 1921. While advocating a \"united front from below,\" the Party attacked other socialist parties as \"social fascists\" and denounced the AFL as \"an organ to suppress and disorganize the masses\" which workers should join only to \"overthrow the reformist bureaucracy\" that ran them. The CP instead focused on founding new revolutionary unions in the expectation that the collapse of capitalism was just around the corner.\n\nThese new dual unions were, in fact, often more like ginger groups than unions, with few members and even fewer long-term members. Nonetheless these groups did make some heroic efforts to organize the unorganized. In 1929 the National Textile Workers led a strike of thousands of textile workers in Gastonia, North Carolina, who walked out, despite the NTW's attempts to hold them back, after management fired five union activists. That strike was crushed after mobs of citizens smashed up union offices and murdered a union activist.\n\nWhile local authorities, preachers and newspapers played up the National Textile Workers' association with godless communism and its opposition to white supremacy, it is unlikely that this made much difference in the final analysis. The authorities reacted just as violently when the much less radical AFL intervened after a spontaneous strike of textile workers erupted in other mill towns several months later. That strike likewise ended in mass arrests and the killing of three strikers, shot in the back by sheriffs.\n\nThe CP's efforts in mining were just as unsuccessful. The CP had once had a good deal of support in the internecine struggles within the United Mine Workers in the 1920s, when John L. Lewis used every weapon available to defeat his rivals for union leadership while wages and working conditions in the industry grew worse. The TUEL-supported candidate who ran for UMW President against Lewis in the 1924 election was credited with 66,000 votes in the official tally – nearly half what Lewis received. The CP later allied itself, for a time, with John Brophy, whose \"Save the Union\" slate probably would have won election to national leadership in 1926 if the vote had been held democratically.\n\nLewis, however, effectively drove all of the TUEL and Brophy supporters from the union after his victory in 1926. The CP later burned its bridges with Brophy, denouncing him as a reformist.\n\nThe CP founded its own National Miners Union in 1928. It engaged in a fierce struggle to undo wage cuts when miners struck in Pennsylvania and Ohio mines in 1931, but lost the strike when mine operators chose to recognize the UMW – which had not been involved in the strike – rather than the NMU, then obtained an injunction to prevent the NMU from picketing.\n\nThe NMU also took on the leadership of a strike that the UMW had called in Harlan County, Kentucky in 1931 with even more disastrous results, since the union was not prepared to provide the relief necessary to permit strikers to remain out for any length of time, particularly in the face of attacks by \"gun thugs.\" The NMU's strong opposition to racial discrimination and wholehearted support for the Soviet Union also served to alienate it from the mostly fundamentalist and predominantly white miners in Harlan County. While the strike publicized the horrific conditions in one of the most isolated parts of Appalachia, it did not produce any concrete benefits for striking miners.\n\nThere were, however, some bright spots for the CP: their Food Workers Industrial Union successfully organized cafeteria and restaurant workers, particularly in New York, where many of the restaurant workers unions had been taken over by Dutch Schultz as part of his labor rackets. Those CP-led unions not only fended off Schultz's gangsters, but thrived, and became dominant within the AFL Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union in New York when they affiliated with it several years later.\n\nThe Maritime Workers Industrial Union did not survive the Third Period, but it left its mark. Sailors and longshoremen had a tradition of radical politics and more or less spontaneous job actions; the IWW had been particularly active in both east and west coast ports up through the 1920s. The MWIU organized occasional strikes, attacked the inadequate relief provided for unemployed workers by the YMCA and other groups, and distributed the MWIU's newspapers.These programs attracted a number of sailors and longshoremen, including Harry Bridges, who subsequently led the west coast longshore strike of 1934.\n\nThe TUUL had similar limited success in the automobile industry, where it established shop nuclei that linked the Party with the campaign for industrial unionism. The CP was, however, more successful in organizing unemployed workers in Detroit and other auto centers than it was in recruiting or organizing auto workers.\n\nThe CP initially looked on the New Deal and the Roosevelt administration as a form of fascism, because the National Industrial Recovery Act provided for a form of corporativist rule, calling on industries to negotiate codes that would regulate prices, production, labor relations and other matters with only indirect government supervision. The government panels created under the NRA generally gave in to employer demands and appeared to be more concerned with preventing strikes than with protecting workers' rights or living standards.\n\nWorkers flocked to unions for representation, often in advance of any union organizing efforts, in the belief that Roosevelt and the NRA would protect them. Lewis and the UMWA capitalized on this sentiment in 1933 when his organizers told miners that \"The President wants you to join the Union.\" While the UMWA organizers may have meant President Lewis, they did not correct the misimpression on the part of many miners who thought they meant President Roosevelt.\n\nWorkers engaged in a wave of strikes, the most since 1921, in 1934. The largest and most significant were three giant strikes for union recognition among longshoremen on the West Coast, truck drivers in Minneapolis, Minnesota and automobile workers in Toledo, Ohio. In each case the strike became either a general strike or something close to it.\n\nIn each case radicals, either associated with the CPUSA or other leftwing parties, played key leadership roles; the CP and its allies, such as Harry Bridges, played an important role in the west coast longshore strike. The CP's influence depended, however, on the personal charisma of Harry Bridges and the hard work put in by its members and sympathizers on the docks, rather than on the MWIU itself, which largely disappeared when its radical cadres followed the membership into the newly revived west coast locals of the ILA. While Bridges was apparently never a member of the CP — something the government tried to prove, without success, in four different trials over more than a decade — he worked closely with Party activists and helped advance their careers within the union, while the union that grew out of the strike, the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union, espoused the party's politics for decades.\n\nThe Party's role in the founding of the Transport Workers Union of America was even clearer: two TUUL organizers, John Santo and Austin Hogan, were instrumental in the founding of the union in 1934, and almost all of its original leaders, including Mike Quill, were either Party members or close followers of Party policies. The TWU won the right to represent New York City's public transit workers after several years of clandestine organizing, a series of small strikes, a sitdown strike in the BMT's Kent Avenue powerhouse in 1937 and an overwhelming victory among IRT employees in an NLRB election several months later.\n\nYet while the CP played a leading role in that organization, Party members, even those whose party membership had been open in the past, chose to downplay or conceal their membership. Hogan, a CP candidate for Congress in 1934, kept his party affiliation private, to the extent that was possible, after he became President of TWU Local 100, the local of New York City subway workers. The party discontinued its shop papers, which went by names such as \"Red Dynamo\" and \"Red Express\", in 1935, when TWU organizers claimed that the party's overt role in the union was interfering with their efforts and when Popular Front alliance-building replaced Third Period separatism. While the party remained influential — some said dominant — in the union until 1949, and the union closely followed party policies on issues such as civil rights, public ownership of the subways and fare increases, the party took no credit for its contributions and party members vigorously rejected claims of employers, intra-union opponents and investigators that the party was, in fact, a major influence in the union.\n\nThe CP similarly gained influence at first in the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, on the strength of individual members' work. Lee Pressman, the General Counsel for the CIO and later the United Steelworkers of America, was a member of the CP and the underground Ware group involved in espionage for the Soviet Union. The first publicity director for the CIO, Len De Caux, was likewise a member of the CP throughout his years with the CIO as were many more organizers and rank-and-file activists within the unions affiliated with the CIO.\n\nIndividuals like Pressman and De Caux would not have considered working for the CIO if the CP had not shifted its position from sectarian purity to first a united front and later a popular front policy that favored alliances with other \"progressive forces.\" At the same time the New Deal was turning to the left, in response to both the increasingly hostile response by employers and the wave of worker discontent that had replaced the apathetic resignation of the first years of the Great Depression. The CP, having denounced Roosevelt as a fascist only a few years earlier, moved closer and closer to embracing him.\n\nAt the same time the CIO and other progressive organizations and individuals overcome many of their reservations about working with the CP. Of the two hundred or so organizers that Lewis hired for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, sixty were CP members, with particular strength among the staff responsible for organizing foreign-born and African-American workers and in the Chicago area.\n\nLewis was not particularly concerned with the political beliefs of his organizers, so long as he controlled the organization. As he once famously remarked, \"I do not turn my organizers or CIO members upside down and shake them to see what kind of literature falls out of their pockets.\" He took the same line in private, when David Dubinsky of the ILGWU asked him about the communists on the SWOC staff; as he told Dubinsky, \"Who gets the bird? The hunter or the dog?\"\n\nThe CP did not gain influence solely through seeking staff positions, however. In the rubber workers' strike in Akron, Ohio that represented the first test of the CIO's ability to turn mass discontent into union gains, a number of rank-and-file leaders were also CP members. The Party had a degree of presence, both at the local and international level, in the United Rubber Workers union formed after the strike.\n\nThe CP also exerted a great deal of influence within the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (or UE), founded in 1936 by the merger of a number of federal unions created by the AFL and small shop caucuses, largely made up of CP activists and other socialists and radicals, at General Electric, Westinghouse Electric Company and other unorganized companies. The CP grew even more powerful within the UE in 1937 when James Matles, former head of the CP's Metal Workers Industrial Union, brought in a number of locals after a brief affiliation with the International Association of Machinists. Matles and other CP members and allies held the bulk of the important positions within the UE for the next twelve years, until the CIO engineered a split within it in order to separate the Communist leaders from the CIO; they continued to hold power thereafter within that portion of the union that was not raided by the International Union of Electrical Workers.\n\nThe CP achieved even greater results, but less long-term success, working within the United Automobile Workers. Like the UE, the UAW was also formed in 1936 out of a number of federal unions created by the AFL and locals from other unions in the industry. Of its 25,000 workers, almost all came from outside Michigan.\n\nOne of the most prominent UAW activists in the early years of the union was Wyndham Mortimer, who had led a strike against White Motors in Cleveland, Ohio. Mortimer was elected Vice-President at the UAW's first convention and might have been elected President if not for concern about his Party membership.\n\nMortimer and the CP formed alliances at that first convention with George Addes, then the secretary-treasurer of the UAW, later its President, and Walter Reuther, who headed the UAW from 1947 until his death in 1970. The CP maintained its alliance with Addes, the center of the left-wing caucus within the UAW, for the next decade. Its alliance with Reuther proved much shorter.\n\nWhen the UAW decided to organize the industry by going after General Motors, Mortimer was sent to Flint, Michigan, where GM's production was centered. Even at that early stage factional infighting within the UAW, in particular between Mortimer and Homer Martin, the first President of the UAW, threatened to derail the campaign. When Martin pulled Mortimer out of Flint, Mortimer arranged for Bob Travis, another union activist and CP member from Toledo, to replace him.\n\nTravis played an active role in the Flint Sit-Down Strike, aided by some veteran CP autoworkers inside Fisher Body Plant #1 – but also by other radical workers, some belonging to Trotskyist parties, the Socialist Party or the IWW. The same pattern applied outside the plants: Socialist Party members, such as Walter Reuther's brothers Victor Reuther and Roy Reuther, and the Socialists and ex-Socialists working for the CIO cooperated with CP members, such as Henry Kraus, the UAW's publicity director, with a minimum of sectarian bickering.\n\nThe CP, in fact, played down its revolutionary politics during the sit-down strike. In part this was to avoid giving GM and its allies an issue to use against the strike; in part it was out of fear of distancing the Party from the strikers, who were, in the opinion of CP leadership, using revolutionary means to achieve traditional union goals. The Socialists, by contrast, had a much smaller base within the striking workers, but were much more inclined to attach revolutionary significance to the sit-down strikes and to magnify their own role in them.\n\nThe CP was even more circumspect in the Steel Workers Organizing Committee. The CP was anxious not to scare off its partners and employers in the CIO: its members therefore made no effort to advertise their Party affiliation and even took steps not to pack SWOC conventions.\n\nNor did circumstances give them much opportunity to rise to leadership. Unlike the UAW, which was born out of tumultuous struggles in which CP activists and other radicals played leading parts, the SWOC conducted a much more top-down organizing campaign subject to close control. SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP played an important role in recruiting and organizing members, but rarely stayed in one area long enough to cultivate the sort of relations with local leaders that might have allowed them to recruit them into the Party, if they had tried to do so. They simply did not have the freedom of action that Mortimer, Travis and others within the UAW did.\n\nNor did they have the same power. As staff members, Pressman, de Caux and the SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP had, at most, only indirect influence on CIO or SWOC policy and no independent base to rally support or propagandize for other issues. Philip Murray, a former UMWA associate whom Lewis installed as head of the SWOC, weeded out most of the Communists from the union over the years after the initial organizing drives as the SWOC became the United Steelworkers of America. By 1942 the purge was almost complete.\n\n\n"}

In India, the Dhanuk are found in the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In Nepal, they are settled in the Terai districts of Saptari, Siraha and Dhanusa. They are either Kshetris or a minority indigenous people. The Dhanuks of eastern Terai are also known as Mandal. The Dhanuk is also known as Jaswal Kurmi. The Dhanuk in both countries are Hindu, and speak various dialects of Hindi, such as Bhojpuri and Awadhi.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Dhanuk community gets its name from the Sanskrit word \"dhanushka\", meaning a bowman.\n\nThe Dhanuk (Dhanak) are strictly endogamous, and practice clan exogamy. Their main clans are the Dhankar, Dholbaja, Katheriya, Khakarpuria, Laungvasta, and Supabandha. All these sub-groups are not of equal status, and there is hierarchy on the basis of their respective occupations. A small number of the Dhanuk are a now petty landowners. Because of their switching to petty works for livelihood they are treated as Dalits. As a Dalit community, they face social discrimination whose settlements are found at the edge of villages.\n\nThe Dhanuk speak various dialects of Hindi.\n\nThe Dhanak of Haryana are a community of weavers, also known as Kabirpanthi Pandit. They have been granted Scheduled Caste status, and are found throughout the state. They now speak Haryana, and are said to have immigrated from Awadh. The community consists of a number of clans, and practices clan exogamy. Their main clans include the Duggal , Nugaria (Nagoria), Ninania, Khatak, Pacherwal, Kerar, Katheria, Mundadiya, Ladwal, Morwal, Mahore, Rangbhaa, Bagadi, Suralia,Frand, Solia (Solanki), Bharor, Atkan, Gorraiya, Bumra, Siyan, Kataria and Indora. The Dhanak are a landless community, with many employed in their traditional occupation of weaving. Most live in multi-caste villages, occupying their own distinct quarters. Each settlement contains a traditional caste council known as a \"biradari panchayat\". This acts as an instrument of social control, as well as acting as an informal welfare association.\n\nDifferent types/groups of Dhanuk live in Nepal. They are settled all over the country from Eastern Terai to Western hills. Among them, the Dhanuks of hilly region in Far-Western are considered as a Kshetris, who were believed to have originated from Bhatt Brahmin of Doti Rajya, Ugratara temple. One brother of Brahman was believed to have been given titled Kshetri by Kalu Shahi the king of Doti Rajya at that time as he protected the king from Muslims who attacked the Doti kingdom. It is also believed that that Brahmin used his tantrik knowledge and bravery to protect his religion and kingdom. These people have a history of about 200 years being called Dhanuk. The people of this group follow the rituals like other Kshetris of that area.\n\nThere are Dhanuk called mandal or Rajvansi living in the Eastern part of Nepal. They are also mainly Hindu but perform different rituals. The rites of birth, death and marriage are performed by giving due importance like other tribes. The pregnant woman is kept in a separate home to arrange assistance from a dagrin (midwife) of the same caste. The baby is caused to cry as soon as it is born. The ghosts are driven away by putting the branches of jujube and discarded shoes in the main gate of the house. The baby is given the milk of a she-goat to drink. Chhaiti is done in six days and Barahi in twelve days. In Barahi, worships and festivities are arranged.\n\nDhanuks do not marry within the clan nor do they have the practice of cross-cousin marriage. In most of the cases, the parents seek the girl or the boy. Due to the influence of neighbours they also have the system of dowry.\n\nWhen a Dhanuk dies, the corpse is cremated if the deceased is above 12 years of age and is buried if her or she is below 12 years.\n\nThe houses of Dhanuks are plastered with mud and pictures are drawn of mud too. Women go outside for work but a male member remains the head of the family. Lots of feasts are organised on various occasions. Some Dhanuks never drink spirit and jaand but Dhanuks in general have the practice of drinking raksi or spirit.\n\nThe houses of Dhanuks are built in clusters in the river basins and edges of forests. They like to settle in river basins. A group of ten or eleven households makes a bindar committee and five bindars constitute a praganna. The chief of a praganna is called \"maijan\". There is one post, called \"chaurasi\", above him. These institutions manage tribal reconciliation and settlement of disputes. Those who do not abide by rules are expelled from the ethnic group. Mandal is their thars (clans).\n\nSince they dwell in the river basins and the edges of forests, their main occupations are fishing and animal husbandry. Some of the Dhanuks are big landowners, but the Dhanuks who belong to the group of minority nationality are absolutely landless. They earn their livelihood by working as agricultural labourers and household servants.\n\nIn some places Brahmins are appointed as priests while in other places they use Dhanuk priests. The Dhanuk caste believes in magic, witchcraft and ghosts. They are divided into two religious groups: those who worship Kali are called Kaliyaha and others are called Maharkhiya. Those who worship Kali eat meat and drink spirit or wine, whereas Maharkhiyas do not do so. They worship a goddess called Gahil, who is one of five sisters. The other goddesses are Shitalmata and Goureya Gaiya. The main occupation of Dhanuks is working for big zamindars (landowners) and farming.\n\nThe Dhanuks live all across India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In Nepal, they are scattered from Morang in the east to the Terai in the west. But the Dhanuk are also found in Saptari, Siraha and Dhanusa in the east. Their main area of settlement stretches from Saptari to Dhanusa in the plain inner valley south of the Churia hills. It is hard to tell the population of minority nationality of Dhanuks in Nepal. In India, they are found in a wide region stretching from Haryana to Bihar.\n\nThe 2011 Census of India for Uttar Pradesh showed the Dhanuk classified as a Scheduled Caste with a population of 651,355.\n\nIn Nepal, their language is Maithali. They are influenced by Hindu religion and the Indian culture across the border.\n\nIn India, the Dhanuk of north Bihar speak Maithili, while those of eastern Uttar Pradesh speak Awadhi.\nJharkhand speak Santhali.\n"}

Journalist José Reveles reported in his book, \"El cártel incómodo: El fin de los Beltrán Leyva y la hegemonía del Chapo Guzmán\", that Raúl Gutiérrez Parra, who was also later killed, ordered Los Güeros to murder Jiménez Mota as his investigations interfered with the flow of drugs through Sinaloa.\n\nAlfredo Jiménez Mota was born on February 16, 1980, in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, where he continued to reside as a career minded bachelor. He is the only son of Esperanza Mota Martinez and Jose Alfredo Jiménez Hernandez, and the only brother of Leticia, his sister. Jiménez Mota began his work in the state of Sinaloa upon earning his degree at the Universidad de Occidente in Culiacán, in Communication. The Jiménez family are Catholic and attended Cristo Rey de Empalme, where Jiménez Mota sang in the choir. In his early years, Jiménez Mota enjoyed boxing, weighing in at 240-pounds.\n\nThe career of Alfredo Jiménez Mota' began in newspapers while he was still a student in Culiacán, where he worked for \"El Sol de Culiacán\", \"El Debate\" and \"Noroeste\", Sinaloa. and began to report in the genre of the nota roja (tabloid style crime stories). He was also director of social communication at the Attorney General Office of Culiacán, Sinaloa. In late 2004, Jiménez Mota joined \"El Imparcial\", where he often wrote stories dangerous enough that editors did not want to print his byline but Jiménez Mota insisted on the credit. He disappeared five months into his employment.\n\nPrior to his disappearance, Jiménez Mota was investigating the government's involvement in drug trafficking in the region of Sinaloa and possible involvement with the Beltrán Leyva and Sinaloa cartels, the latter involving drug lords Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada García and Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration was also investigating drug trafficking into the US from this northern border region. On April 2, 2005 Jiménez Mota was being followed and photographed, which led to him seeking refuge at Los Grillos, a restaurant at Hilalgo Square, until he could safely make his way back to his office. Prior to this incident he was receiving death threats from an unknown source which led to his vigilance on the job and in his personal life. It was later this same evening when Jiménez Mota disappeared, never to be seen nor heard from again. According to his friends and colleagues, Jiménez Mota failed to show up for drinks at a restaurant where they planned to speak about their days events. During his investigations, Jiménez Mota caused a stir in the State Attorney General's office by his persistence. He also angered the Police Chief while examining connections between the department and local drug trafficking. There are conflicting accounts on what happened the evening Jiménez Mota went missing. In one account, there is a letter which states the remains of Jiménez Mota could be found in one of three \"safe houses\" in Villa Itson. In another account, two women who claim to have been kidnapped but go away, say they overheard their captors speaking of Jiménez Mota being held at the same location prior to his execution. The remains of Jiménez Mota have yet to be found, no perpetrators have been charged, and the case remains unsolved.\n\nIn an effort to silence reporters, Mexico ranks 11th of all countries, and 1st in Latin countries in cartel-related homicides of journalists. While there are many suspects in the disappearance of Alfredo Jiménez Mota, the case has never been solved. In November 2005, a suspect Raul Enrique Parra and drug trafficker was brutally murdered.\n\nJiménez Mota's disappearance marked the first case of missing or murdered journalists in Hermocillo, the capitol of the state of Sonora. Within days of his disappearance the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) and Rapid Response Unit (URR) began to investigate. The IAPA demanded all authorities get involved in an effort to stop the murder of journalists and to support the effort of freedom of expression. The case was taken to the Deputy Attorney General for Specialized Investigation in Organized Crime (SIEDO) where they vowed the case would be resolved. The IAPA and over 40 newspaper directors met in August 2005 to discuss solutions and build strength in journalism. While the reporting arm of this group—called the Phoenix Group after a similar investigative project in the United States after Don Bolles was murdered by the mafia—revealed federal and state officials could be involved in the disappearance of Jiménez Mota, the administrative arm issued the \"Declaration of Hermicillo\" as a set of concrete steps the state could take to ensure the safety of journalists. With the growing intimidation of reporters, the IAPA published a map which provided journalists locations of high risk and safety issues.\n\nThe family of Alfredo Jiménez Mota held a memorial on the 10th anniversary of their son's disappearance with memorabilia and activities. The community of Hermocillo celebrated his memory by attending the unveiling of a plaque which was placed at The Plaza del Tinaco in his honor.\n\nIn a letter to the Attorney General of Mexico, the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote, \"The Committee to Protect Journalists would like to express its concern about the fate of Alfredo Jiménez Mota ... We are worried about our colleague's safety. We urge you to conduct a timely and thorough investigation, locate Jiménez, and bring him to safety. CPJ will be monitoring the investigation and respectfully asks that you make available to us any information you might have regarding this case.\"\n\nColleagues of Jiménez Mota demanded the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) to step up its investigation. The consensus in the media community was those who were possibly involved, were sweeping the case under the rug. Since the disappearance of Jiménez Mota, the fight to \"quiet\" the press has made reporting difficult.\n\nKoïchiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO, said in a statement that also included Jiménez Mota, \"Crimes against journalists and editors constitute a grievous offence against democracy.\"\n\nMota was posthumously awarded the International Editor Award 2005 for his bravery in journalism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3959583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3959583", "title": "Efik people", "text": "Efik people\n\nThe Efik are an ethnic group located primarily in southeastern Nigeria, in the southern part of Cross River State. The Efik speak the Efik language which is a Benue–Congo language of the Cross River family. Efik oral histories tell of migration down the Cross River from Arochukwu to found numerous settlements in the Calabar and Creek Town area. Creek Town and its environs are often commonly referred to as \"Calabar\", and its people as \"Calabar people\", after the European name \"Calabar Kingdom\" given to the state [in present-day Cross River State. Calabar is not to be confused with the Kalabari Kingdom in Rivers State which is an Ijaw state to its west. Cross River State with Akwa Ibom State was formerly one of the original twelve states of Nigeria known as the Southeastern State.\n\nThe Efik people also occupy southwestern Cameroon including Bakassi. This area, formerly a trust territory from German Cameroon, was administered as a part of the Eastern Region of Nigeria until it achieved autonomy in 1954, thus separating the Efik people politically. This separation was further extended when as a result of a 1961 plebiscite the area voted to join the Republic of Cameroon. Most of the area was immediately transferred, but in August 2006 - Nigeria handed over the Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon.\n\nThe people of Uruan were said to have given them the name \"Efik\" deriving from a verb meaning to press or oppress, since they were alleged to be aggressive.\n\nThe Efik people are found in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria, in “the South Eastern corner of the Cross River State.” They occupy the basins of the Lower Cross River and down to the Bakassi Peninsula, the Calabar River and down to its tributaries – the Kwa River, Akpayafe (Akpa Ikang) and the Eniong Creek.” They occupied Calabar “towards the end of the seventeenth century or at the beginning of the 18th century.” \nThe Efik are related to the Annang, Ibibio, Oron, Biase, Akamkpa, Uruan, and Eket people.\n\nAlthough the actual origins of the Efik people are unknown, oral traditions provide accounts of their migration from Igbo and Ibibio territory (to the north-west of Calabar) to the present location. The bulk of them left to Uruan in present-day Akwa Ibom State, some to Eniong and surrounding areas. They stayed in Uruan for about a hundred or so years and then moved to Ikpa Ene and Ndodihi briefly before crossing over to their final destination in Creek Town (Esit Edik / Obio Oko). There would seem to be three successive stages in the history of efik migration and settlement: (a) an Igbo phase (b) an Ibibio phase and (c) the drift to the coast.\n\nAlthough their economy was originally based on fishing, the area quickly developed into a major trading centre and remained so well into the early 1900s. Incoming European goods were traded for slaves, palm oil and other palm products. The Efik kings collected a trading tax called comey from docking ships until the British replaced it with 'comey subsidies'. The diary of Antera Duke, an Efik, is the only surviving record from an African slave-trading house.\n\nThe Efik were the middle men between the white traders on the coast and the inland tribes of the Cross River and Calabar district. Christian missions were at work among the Efiks beginning in the middle of the 19th century. Mary Slessor, a Presbyterian missionary from Scotland, was concerned with eliminating the tribal superstitious practice of killing twin babies. Even by 1900, many of the native peoples were well educated in European ideologies and culture, professed Christianity and dressed in European fashion.\n\nA powerful bond of union among the Efik, and one that gives them considerable influence over other tribes, is the secret society known as the Ekpe, the inventor of the Nsibidi, an ancient African Writing.\n\nThe Efik and indeed the people of the Old Calabar kingdom were the first to embrace western education in present-day Nigeria, with the establishment of Hope Waddel Training Institute, Calabar in 1895 and the Methodist Boys' High School, Oron in 1905.\n\nIn 1884 the Efik kings and the chiefs of the Efik placed themselves under British protection. These treaties and attendant territorial economic rights, are documented in CAP 23 of Laws of Eastern Nigeria, captioned 'Comey subsidies law'. The Efik king, also known as the Obong of Calabar, still (as of 2006) is a political power among the Efik.\n\nThe Efik people speak the Efik language, which is a Benue–Congo language of the Cross River family.\n\nWe are Efik People\n\n\nEdikang Ikong is a vegetable soup that originated among the Efik.\n\n\n\n"}

During his career he was noted within his profession for his research into Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.\n\nHe completed his doctoral research in 1994 at the Maastricht University, researching Parkinson's disease. \n\nJansen Steur was interviewed as an expert on the disease by the Dutch television program \"EénVandaag\" on 24 July 2002 regarding the condition of Prince Claus of the Netherlands (Jansen Steur indicated on the show that he found the prince's condition \"worrisome\").\n\nJansen Steur sufferent a serious car accident in Germany in 1990, resulting in a complex hip fracture. In 2000 he became addicted to Midazolam, a sedative. In order to obtain this drug he started forging prescriptions using his colleagues' names as prescribing physicians. \n\nAs it turned out later, in the four years following his becoming addicted, he regularly misdiagnosed patients. In order to support his misdiagnoses, he forged diagnostic questionnaires from patients, swapped patient x-rays and forged laboratory results. He prescribed strong medications unnecessarily for a number of his patients and in a number of cases had patients undergo brain surgery without necessity.\n\nJansen Steur was forced to resign from the MST by the board in 2004. He received a €250.000 severance package and was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement (together with his former colleagues). As part of this deal, he agreed to strike himself from the Dutch registry of medical professionals, thereby giving up the right to practice in the Netherlands. Patients received financial compensation, but were sworn to secrecy.\n\nDespite the deal with Jansen Steur (resulting in his resignation from MST and voluntary removal from the registry), the board of MST decided to begin an investigation in 2009 due to a turnover of board members which included the installation of as the new chairman. The investigation was headed by , the former mayor of Hengelo. The Lemstra committee reported on 1 September 2009, concluding failures on the part of the MST but also of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate (: \"Inspectie voor de Gezondheidszorg\" or \"IGZ\"), which was headed by Kingma at the time that Jansen was being sent away from the MST. The committee also concluded Jansen had been failing as a doctor since 1992 and that the MST had failed to address the situation for years.\n\nUpon the release of this report, the Dutch minister of Health Ab Klink instituted another investigative committee headed by Rein Jan Hoekstra, to investigate the functioning of the Health Care Inspectorate.\n\nThis committee supported the conclusions of the Lemstra committee regarding the failing of the Inspectorate, concluding that the Inspectorate waited far too long to take measures against Jansen and should have filed criminal charges against him rather than settling for a voluntary relinquishing of his status as a physician. They also criticized the MST and the doctors treating Jansen Steur for his injuries in that they did not cooperate fully with the investigation by the Inspectorate. Both of Jansen's doctors invoked physician–patient privilege. However, the Inspectorate concluded in an internal investigation concluded on 17 February 2009 that they had functioned correctly in the matter of Jansen Steur.\n\nIt was announced in October 2009 that Jansen Steur would have to face charges in court after all, charges having been leveled by a special investigative team of the police for this case (the Lippstadt-team). The team had, by that point, gathered 135 different complaints from patients regarding Jansen Steur. The justice department called the case \"the biggest medical trial in the Netherlands ever\".\n\nThe trial was started on 28 November 2012; it was announced on this first trial day that Jansen Steur was facing 21 criminal charges, including causing grievous bodily and mental harm through misdiagnoses of eight patients, causing one patient to commit suicide, theft, embezzlement and fraud. A total of 40 people filed charges against the doctor. \n\nThere were charges filed by personal injury expert , who filed charges in name of a few dozen injured patients and in name of the families of three patients who died after having been treated by Jansen Steur. In addition to these charges, charges were filed of scientific fraud, after investigation by the Lemstra committee showed that Jansen Steur had falsified results in order to publish an article in \"The Lancet\". The court in Arnhem sentenced him for deliberately setting misdiagnosis, wrongly prescribing strong medicines and the denial of care. In addition he was considered responsible for a suicide of a female patient due to his diagnosis. The court sentenced in February 2014 3 years of prison. Jansen Steur appealed.\n\nMetta de Noo, a physician and acquaintance of Jansen Steur claimed in her book of 2015 that he suffered a frontal lobe disorder due to the 1990 accident and should not be held criminally accountable. \n\nAfter being forced out of the MST in 2004, Jansen Steur moved to Germany, where he worked for several private clinics. After Dutch correspondent Rob Vorkink tracked him down to the Schlossberg Klinik in Bad Laasphe and tried to interview him for RTV Oost, Jansen Steur was immediately fired from that institute.\n\nThe Netherlands was shocked on 4 January 2013 when the NOS evening news led with the story that Jansen Steur had found another job as a neurologist in the \"Klinik am Gesundbrunnen\" hospital in Heilbronn. He was discovered there by the same Rob Vorkink, who recognized Jansen Steur's voice in a phone call (despite his denying that he was the same person). NOS reporter Marc Hamer verified his identity by passing around photographs among hospital personnel. He was subsequently fired from the hospital on 5 January 2013.\n\nAlthough the hospital noted at first that Jansen Steur had been allowed to work at the hospital because he left his profession voluntarily in the Netherlands in 2010 (preventing the hospital from checking his credentials with the Dutch registry) and as there were no criminal convictions against him when he applied to the hospital, it soon transpired that the hospital had in fact been aware of Jansens past. \n\nOn 6 January 2013, a German patient filed charges over treatment she received from Jansen Steur in Heilbronn, which she claimed left her wheelchair-bound.\n\nSteur is the doctor's mother's maiden name. He added this name to his surname of \"Jansen\", which is one of the most common surnames in the Netherlands, and is known to the general public as \"Ernst Jansen Steur\".\n\n"}

The word is derived from Turkish \"gurbet\", meaning \"emigrate\". The first mentions of nomadic Roma attributed as Gurbeti ancestors, mostly Rroma escaping slavery in Wallachia, is from the 17th century. The Gurbeti Roma's ancestors left Wallachia and Moldavia in the 19th century after abolition of slavery. In 1941, most of the Yugoslav Roma settled permanently, with the exception of the Gurbeti in Montenegro.\n\nThey share some cultural features with the Kalderaš, but also with other Roma such as Xoraxane.

{"id": "29873086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29873086", "title": "Human trafficking in Benin", "text": "Human trafficking in Benin\n\nBenin is a country of origin and transit for children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically conditions of forced labor and forced prostitution. Until recently, analysts also considered Benin a destination country for foreign children brought to the country and subjected to forced labor, but new information from government and non-government sources indicates the total number of such children is not significant. The majority of victims are girls trafficked into domestic servitude or the commercial sex trade in Cotonou, the administrative capital. Some boys are forced to labor on farms, work in construction, produce handicrafts, or hawk items on the street. Many traffickers are relatives or acquaintances of their victims, exploiting the traditional system of vidomegon, in which parents allow their children to live with and work for richer relatives, usually in urban areas. There are reports that some tourists visiting Pendjari National Park in northern Benin exploit underage girls in prostitution, some of whom may be trafficking victims. Beninese children recruited for forced labor exploitation abroad are destined largely for Nigeria and Gabon, with some also going to Ivory Coast and other African countries, where they may be forced to work in mines, quarries, or the cocoa sector.\n\nThe Government of Benin does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Over the last year, the government took steps to accelerate prosecution of trafficking offenders and increase the number of protective and preventive activities. In efforts to prevent human trafficking, it promulgated three decrees regulating the movement of children into and out of Benin and continued its countrywide effort to register births and issue birth certificates to all citizens. The government did not, however, collect and make available to its citizens and partners accurate law enforcement data on human trafficking issues. Further, it did not give its officials specialized training on how to recognize, investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking.\n\nU.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2 Watchlist\" in 2017.\n\nThe government sustained its efforts to bring trafficking offenders to justice during the reporting period. Legislatively, Benin does not prohibit all forms of trafficking, though its 2006 Act Relating to the Transportation of Minors and the Suppression of Child Trafficking criminalizes all forms of child trafficking and prescribes penalties of up to 20 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and exceed those prescribed for rape. The child trafficking law does not cover adults, though existing laws against kidnapping and labor exploitation give some protection to people more than 18 years old. The Ministry of Justice, Legislation and Human Rights reported that Benin’s eight courts handled a total of 200 cases of child trafficking and related offenses, including child abduction and corruption of children. At the close of the reporting period, 155 cases remained pending, five cases were dismissed, and 40 cases resulted in convictions; the government neither specified which of these cases involved child trafficking nor provided information on sentences given to convicted trafficking offenders. The Police Brigade for the Protection of Minors (BPM) handled 58 cases involving child trafficking or illegal movement of children out of the country without parental authorization, bringing 17 perpetrators to the Cotonou court for further investigation and prosecution. Gendarmes in the village of Porga arrested suspected traffickers trying to cross the Benin-Burkina Faso border en route to Ivory Coast with five children in April 2009, and delivered them to the court at Natitingou. The government did not provide information on the outcome of the Porga case, or data on cases handled by other branches of the police. There was no evidence of Beninese government officials’ complicity in trafficking offenses. Although the senior police members were provided training on child trafficking issues as part of their training at the police academy, other officials were not trained to recognize, investigate, and prosecute trafficking offenses.\n\nFour government ministries and several international donors and NGOs effectively used their partnerships to widen Benin’s ability to assist, repatriate, and reintegrate victims of trafficking in 2009. The BPM reported rescuing 266 trafficking victims as they were being transported to and from Nigeria, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Togo; these rescues were the product of partnerships with authorities of those countries. This figure represents an increase of 22 more rescues than in the previous year. Furthermore, working with UNICEF and Gabonese officials, the government repatriated 28 Beninese children, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, rescued from a boat carrying clandestine migrants off the coast of Gabon. In most cases, the BPM took initial custody of victims once inside Benin, and after an interview to confirm their status as trafficking victims, typically referred them to a network of long-term NGO shelters. The BPM holds recovered victims at a large government-built transit shelter it maintained in Cotonou, staffed by seven NGO personnel, until transferring victims to an NGO shelter for reintegration. During 2009, the BPM shelter took in 941 children, many of whom were trafficking victims, and offered them legal, medical, and psychological assistance. The Ministry of Family and National Solidarity worked with NGOs to reunite children with their families. No child goes back to its community of origin until there is a suitable point of reinsertion such as a school, vocational center, or apprenticeship. The government extended access for these children to the national network of social promotion centers, which provide basic social services in each of the country’s 77 communes. Foreign victims of trafficking offenses received assistance from the government through the BPM and social promotion centers before repatriation. According to an NGO leading the repatriation and shelter of Beninese victims from the Abeokuta quarries in Nigeria, the Beninese Ministry of Family, the BPM, and the Beninese Consulate in Nigeria repatriated 20 trafficking victims between August and December 2009. Both BPM and the office of Family and Child Monitoring at the Ministry of Family established operational databases on child trafficking during the year, but neither yielded data on trafficking victims during the reporting period. Officials encouraged victims to assist in the investigation of trafficking offenders, but shielded children from taking part in the trial unless a judge required it. Victims were not inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, but the government did not have a mechanism for screening victims of trafficking among populations of women and children in prostitution.\n\nThrough partnerships with local and international agencies, the government provided partial support for several new programs to prevent child trafficking. In 2009, the Ministry of Family, with foreign donor support, established 142 new local committees to enable community surveillance in Benin and along the Benin-Nigeria border. The BPM, immigration agents, and gendarmes took up stations at international border crossings to screen travelers and monitor the transport of children. These observers relied on community whistleblowers to alert them to suspicious cases. Furthermore, the government completed ahead of schedule its 2008-2012 National Plan to Combat Child Trafficking and Labor. Also in 2009, the government joined with foreign partners to implement a second anti-child trafficking project to improve living conditions and advance respect for children’s rights, thus addressing key structural causes of Benin’s trafficking problem. The government, in partnership with UNICEF and a major regional bank, launched a seven-day awareness campaign against child sex tourism. The government provided training to Beninese troops on issues of child trafficking and exploitation prior to their deployment abroad for international peacekeeping missions.\n\n"}

In 1464, Peter Raoul composed for the Duke of Burgundy a history of Troy. At that time the French still regarded themselves as descendants of Hector. If we except Paris, none of the French universities took part in the movement. Individual writers and printing-presses at Paris, Lyon, Rouen and other cities became its centres and sources. William Fichet and Robert Gaguin are usually looked upon as the first French Humanists. Fichet introduced \"the eloquence of Rome\" at Paris and set up a press at the Sorbonne. He corresponded with Bessarion and had in his library volumes of Petrarch, Guarino of Verona and other Italians. Gaguin copied and corrected Suetonius in 1468 and other Latin authors. Poggio's Jest-book and some of Valla's writings were translated into French. In the reign of Louis XI, who gloried in the title \"the first Christian king\", French poets celebrated his deeds. The homage of royalty took in part the place among the literary men of France that the cult of antiquity occupied in Italy.\n\nGreek, which had been completely forgotten in France, had its first teachers in Gregory Tifernas, who reached Paris, 1458, John Lascaris, who returned with Charles VIII, and Hermonymus of Sparta, who had Reuchlin and Budaeus (known variously as William Budaeus (English), Guillaume Budé (French) and Guilielmus Budaeus (Latin)) among his scholars. An impetus was given to the new studies by the Italian, Aleander, afterwards famous for his association with Martin Luther at Worms. He lectured in Paris, 1509, on Plato and issued a \"Latino-Greek lexicon\". In 1512 his pupil, Vatable, published the Greek grammar of Chrysoloras. Budaeus, perhaps the foremost Greek scholar of his day, founded the Collège de France, 1530, and finally induced Francis I to provide for instruction in Hebrew and Greek. The University of Paris at the close of the 14th century was sunk into a low condition and Erasmus bitterly complained of the food, the morals and the intellectual standards of the college of Montague which he attended. Budaeus urged the combination of the study of the Scriptures with the study of the classics and exclaimed of the Gospel of John, \"What is it, if not the almost perfect sanctuary of the truth!\"\n\nJacques Lefèvre d'Étaples studied in Paris, Pavia, Padua and Cologne and, for longer or shorter periods, tarried in the greater Italian cities. He knew Greek and some Hebrew. From 1492–1506 he was engaged in editing the works of Aristotle and Raymundus Lullus and then, under the protection of Guillaume Briçonnet, bishop of Meaux, he turned his attention to theology. It was his purpose to offset the \"Sentences\" of Peter the Lombard by a system of theology giving only what the Scriptures teach. In 1509, he published the \"Psalterum quintuplex\", a combination of five Latin versions of the Psalms, including a revision and a commentary by his own hand. In 1512, he issued a revised Latin translation of the Pauline Epistles with commentary. In this work, he asserted the authority of the Bible and the doctrine of justification by faith, without appreciating, however, the far-reaching significance of the latter opinion. Three years after the appearance of Luther's New Testament, Lefevre's French translation appeared, 1523. It was made from the Vulgate, as was his translation of the Old Testament, 1528. In 1522 and 1525, appeared his commentaries on the four Gospels and the Catholic Epistles. The former was put on the Index by the Sorbonne. The opposition to the free spirit of inquiry and to the Reformation, which the Sorbonne stirred up and French royalty adopted, forced him to flee to Strassburg and then to the liberal court of Margaret of Angoulême.\n\nAmong those who came into contact with Lefevre were Farel and Calvin, the Reformers of Geneva. In the meantime Clément Marot, 1495–1544, the first true poet of the French literary revival, was composing his French versification of the Psalms and of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". The Psalms were sung for pleasure by French princes and later for worship in Geneva and by the Huguenots. When Calvin studied the humanities and law at Bourges, Orléans and Paris, about 1520, he had for teachers Cordier and L'Etoile, the canonists, and Melchior Wolmar, teacher of Greek, whose names the future Reformer records with gratitude and respect. He gave himself passionately to Humanistic studies and sent to Erasmus a copy of his work on Seneca's \"Clemency\", in which he quoted frequently from the ancient classics and the Fathers. Had he not adopted the new religious views, it is possible he would now be known as an eminent figure in the history of French Humanism.\n\nJest book\n\n\n"}

In 1991, student Jill Stewart started IU Dance Marathon in honor of her friend, Ryan White, who died from AIDS the year before. Since then, IUDM has raised over $36 million for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, IN, including $4,203,326.23 during the 2017 marathon year. The 2018 marathon took place November 2nd through November 4th and raised $4,187,051.23.\n\nRyan White's 1990 death was the inspiration for the creation of the Indiana University Dance Marathon in 1991. Thirteen-year-old Ryan White contracted AIDS from contaminated blood transfusions he received for hemophilia. When news of the contraction of AIDS became public, his school district in Kokomo, Indiana banned him from attending classes. Ryan then went on to fight in court which led to many headlines across the country and national celebrities like Michael Jackson and Elton John advocated on his behalf. Michael Jackson and Elton John befriended Ryan and helped to spread his story and awareness of AIDS.\n\nAfter arduous court battles, Ryan won the right to return to school; but his battle with the community and AIDS had just begun. The White family dealt with adversity on a daily basis. People were not willing to deal with the concept of AIDS and shunned the Whites. They were victims of fear and anger but had an optimistic outlook that eventually things would return to normal. It was not until a bullet was shot into the White home that the family moved to Cicero, Indiana, where they found peace.\n\nRyan White was one of the biggest advocates of AIDS awareness, appearing at schools and fundraisers across the nation and testified in front of the President's Commission on HIV Epidemic in hopes of changing the public's perception of the disease.\n\nOn April 8, 1990, Ryan White died at the age of 18, right before he was to attend Indiana University. His strength and acceptance of disease helped those battling common illnesses continue to fight. Ryan's life is commemorated by the annual Dance Marathon funds and the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center at Riley Hospital.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2005, the Indiana University campus suffered a loss with the death of one of its students, Ashley Louise Crouse. Ashley was the Vice President of Communications for IUDM and a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority. On her way home from an executive meeting, Ashley was struck and killed by a drunk driver outside the sorority house in which she lived, leaving behind a legacy of hope and passion that continues to live within each person involved in the organization.\n\nBorn and raised in Carmel, Indiana, Ashley's hometown joined with IUDM to create the most successful high school dance marathon in the country. In addition, along with Ryan White, the two are remembered by the thousands of IU students each year during a walk of remembrance each spring.\n\nRiley Hospital for Children, the recipient of the proceeds of the dance marathon, is a nationally ranked pediatric hospital located on the Indiana University School of Medicine's campus in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is one of the largest hospitals in the United States and treats over 80 percent of Hoosier children cancer patients. It continues to be among the best in the nation for its innovative research and unparalleled care. For the third year in a row, Riley Hospital has been ranked nationally in all 10 categories by \"U.S. News and World Report\" and remains the only nationally ranked children's hospital in the state of Indiana.\n\nThe donations support Riley Hospital's mission to not turn away any child regardless of their families financial status. It has more care-beds than any other children's hospital and treats over 150,000 patients a year. Riley Hospital for children holds Indiana's only children's burn center and dialysis center. It welcomes every type of patient and continues to enhance its cutting-edge care and facilities.\n\nIUDM funded the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center which is housed in the Simon Family Tower, a brand new 10-story, 675,000 sq. ft. inpatient center which opened on January 27, 2011. The infectious disease center is led by the Director and Professor of Clinical Pediatrics, Dr. John C. Christenson, , along with the Associate Professor of Clinical Pediatrics, Dr. Elaine G. Cox, . Ryan White's doctor, Dr. Martin B. Kleiman, , continues to practice under infectious disease as the Ryan White Professor of Pediatrics.\n\nFT5K\n\nThe IUDM FT5K is a 5K run/walk that occurs the spring before the marathon and is located across from the Indiana University football stadium. Participation is open public-wide and prizes are awarded to the top three finishers. Following the race, entertainment and food are provided, as well as, time to spend with the Riley kids.\n\nRoad Rules\n\nRoad Rules is a bi-annual canning effort where IUDM committee members form teams of 3-5 on either a Saturday or Sunday morning and are given specific locations within central and southern Indiana, usually consisting of grocery stores, restaurants and walking trails.\n\nA Walk to Remember\n\nEach year, around the anniversary of both Ryan White and Ashley Louise Crouse's deaths, hundreds of students gather to walk in memory of the pairs passing. The walk starts at the Kappa Kappa Gamma house, where Crouse was a member, and continues around campus until ending up back at the Kappa house.\n\nFore the Kids Golf Outing\n\nThe IUDM Golf Outing is the main summer event and takes place at the River Glen Golf Club in Fishers, IN. Last year, the annual outing raised a record $31,000, surpassing 2012's total of $28,000. Individuals are encouraged to create teams to participate in the tournament in addition to a lunch and silent auction. To kick off the tournament, Riley patients and families are invited to share their story and encourage the golfers during their competition.\n\nRunway Riley\n\nRunway Riley is an annual fashion show co-sponsored by IU Dance Marathon and Phi Mu sorority. Not only does the event showcase the year's newest line of IUDM apparel for the first time to the public, but Riley kids and their families are featured as models of the clothing and merchandise. Immediately after the show, all apparel is available for purchase. Since its introduction in September 2012, Runway Riley has raised almost $30,000 FTK. The Riley kids get to feel like superstars in front of hundreds of cheering attendees.\n\nGala\n\nThe Gala, IUDM's largest singular fundraising event, is a formal event held in Indianapolis, Indiana every October. The Special Events committee host a dinner featuring speakers and both a silent and no-reserve auction This event raised nearly $100,000 in 2013.\n\nRiley at the Rock\n\nEach year, IUDM partners with Indiana University Athletics to host a pre-game tailgate featuring food, music, and games during which Riley children (over 60 in 2013) and their families spend time with IUDM participants. Following these pre-game festivities, the families and IUDM students enjoy the unique opportunity of running across the field immediately before the start of the game. Riley at the Rock provides an opportunity for the students to interact with children that have inspired them to participate in IUDM outside of the marathon.\n\nIUDM Gives Back\n\nIUDM Gives Back is an effort in which dance marathon committee members have the opportunity to give back to the Bloomington community through volunteer work. Committee members volunteer for various establishments including the Monroe County Community Kitchen, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the Bloomington Community Orchard, and the WonderLab Museum of Science, Health & Technology.\n\nFor The Kicks\n\nAn annual event where IUDM partners with the Indiana Hoosiers men's soccer for a night of fun, leading up to the team's home game that night.\n\nThe marathon takes place at the Indiana University Tennis Center, located on campus just north of Assembly Hall and Memorial Stadium, from Friday to Sunday one weekend in November. Those volunteering, or dancing, stand for 12, 24, or 36 hours in honor of those who cannot.\n\nBefore the event, all dancers participate in Color Wars fall semester long competition between 8 color teams that compete during the months leading up to the marathon and throughout the duration of the 36 hour dance marathon event. Dancer organizations are randomly divided into color teams and work together to earn points for their color by participating in weekly competitions, fundraising, 3 large-scale events, marathon stage games, and marathon participation. The winner of color wars for the year is announced at the marathon just before the raising of the total.\n\nCommittee members come together to set up, run the event and inspire others for the duration of the weekend. The marathon starts at 8 PM Friday night with dancers running into the gym to the song, \"Eye of the Tiger.\" The executive council is then introduced and the dancers get to witness the famous IUDM Linedance for the first time. After the opening ceremonies, the teams are split up in a variety of stations around the center, including stations geared toward learning the linedance, hospitality and sports activities.\n\nAt certain times all teams and committee members come together to hear artist and speakers perform, participate in activities on stage and listen to Riley stories. Every year, IUDM has many visitors during the duration of the marathon, including IU alumni, faculty and administration, donors, and most importantly, the Riley families. Everyone at the marathon gathers to meet and listen to dozens of Riley children tell their stories. Each Riley kid walks down a red carpet, through the crowd, and up onto the stage, as each participant cheers them onward. During theirs presentations, the room falls silent and everyone uses this moment as a reminder of why they are standing.\n\nAs the marathon comes to a conclusion, the presidential address is given and all participants gather to remember those to which they stand for. Finally, the total is raised officially marking the end of the marathon and showing the hard work put in by thousands over the course of the year.\n\nIn 2018, IUDM raised $4,187,051.23. IUDM 2018 will take place from November 2nd through the 4th.\n\n\n"}

It is currently held on May 22.\n\nThe International Day for Biological Diversity falls within the scope of the UN Post-2015 Development Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals. In this larger initiative of international cooperation, the topic of biodiversity concerns stakeholders in sustainable agriculture; desertification, land degradation and drought; water and sanitation; health and sustainable development; energy; science, technology and innovation, knowledge-sharing and capacity-building; urban resilience and adaptation; sustainable transport; climate change and disaster risk reduction; oceans and seas; forests; vulnerable groups including indigenous peoples; and food security. The critical role of biodiversity in sustainable development was recognized in a Rio+20 outcome document, \"The World We Want: A Future for All\".\n\nFrom its creation by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in 1993 until 2000, it was held on December 29 to celebrate the day the Convention on Biological Diversity went into effect. On December 20, 2000, the date was shifted to commemorate the adoption of the Convention on May 22, 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, and partly to avoid the many other holidays that occur in late December.\n\nCoinciding with the observance of International Day for Biological Diversity, on May 2011 Indonesian Forestry Minister inaugurated the Ciwalen Canopy Trail that is long and wide at an elevation of above the ground at Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park, West Java, to accommodate five to ten people in one trip.\n\nThe 2014 theme of Island Biodiversity was chosen because islands provide a rich source of biodiversity for plants, animals, fish and forestry products. Many indigenous fruits and green leafy vegetables are rich in micronutrients. According to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, two out of every three deaths can be attributed to Non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These can result from a change in diets linked to consumption of highly processed imported products, while local crop species are abandoned or reduced in the local diet. As a consequence, island representatives meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in May, 2014 stressed that serious consideration should be given to more research and policy action with the aim of increasing diet diversity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12846013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12846013", "title": "Jang Song-thaek", "text": "Jang Song-thaek\n\nJang Song-thaek (; also romanized as Jang Sung-taek, Chang Sŏng-t'aek and other variations; January or February 1946 – 12 December 2013) was a leading figure in the government of North Korea. He was married to Kim Kyong-hui, the only daughter of North Korean President Kim Il-sung, and the only sister of North Korean General Secretary Kim Jong-il. He was therefore the uncle-in-law of Kim Jong-un. All of them were supreme leaders of North Korea.\n\nAlthough the precise extent of Jang Song-thaek's power and position during his life cannot be confirmed, in 2008 South Korean government officials and academic North Korea experts suggested that he had taken on \"de facto\" leadership over North Korea while Kim Jong-il's health was declining and when Kim subsequently died. Jang was vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission, a position considered second only to that of the Supreme Leader. He is believed to have been promoted to four-star general around the time of Kim Jong-il's death as his first appearance in uniform was while visiting Kim lying in state. Jang was considered a \"key policy adviser\" to Kim Jong-un.\n\nIn December 2013, Jang was abruptly accused of being a counter-revolutionary and was stripped of all his posts and expelled from the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). His photos were removed from official media and his image digitally removed from photos with other North Korean leaders. On 13 December, North Korea state media announced he had been executed. There have been external reports that many members of his family have also been killed.\n\nJang was born in Chongjin, during the Soviet Civil Administration of Northern Korea. He graduated from the Kim Il-sung Senior High School before leaving for Moscow, where he studied at Moscow State University between 1968 and 1972. Following his return, he married Kim Kyong-hui, the younger (and only) sister of Kim Jong-il. The couple had a daughter, Jang Kum-song (1977–2006), who lived in Paris as an international student; she refused an order to return to Pyongyang and then reportedly committed suicide in September 2006, due to Jang and his wife's opposition to her relationship with her boyfriend. Kim Kyong-hui was reported executed by poison in May 2014 because she complained about her husband's execution.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Jang held a series of positions in the Workers' Party of Korea. His first post was as an instructor for the Pyongyang City Committee of the Workers' Party. In the late 1970s, however Jang's career stalled when he was sent away from the central party to be manager of a steel and ironworks in Nampo, an apparent demotion. Reports said that he was becoming too powerful or, according to other accounts, he had an over-ostentatious lifestyle. It was reported that Jang suffered severe burns in an industrial accident at the factory in Chollima/Kangson. His career recovered and he became deputy director of the Youth Work Department of the KWP Central Committee in 1982 and director in 1985. He was first elected to the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), North Korea's nominal parliament, in 1986.\n\nIn April 1989, Jang was made a People's Hero; in June 1989, he was elected an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. In April 1992, He was named a member of the Order of Kim Il-sung. Later that year he was promoted to full member of the Central Committee. He was a member of the funeral committee for Kim Il-sung in 1994. Jang was appointed to be the first deputy director (or vice director) of the WPK's Organization and Guidance Department in November 1995. He had been identified by outside analysts as well as North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop as a possible successor to Kim Jong-il; however, on 25 November 2004, South Korea's National Assembly heard testimony that he had been purged from his position. Some South Korean intelligence reports indicated that Jang was under house arrest in Pyongyang, while others suggested he might have been sent for \"reeducation\".\n\nJang re-emerged in March 2006, accompanying Kim Jong-il on an official visit to China. In October 2007, the Korean Central News Agency confirmed that Jang had been promoted to the newly recreated post of first vice-director of the Workers' Party of Korea, with oversight responsibility for the police, judiciary, and other areas of internal security; Jang attended South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun's luncheon during the latter's visit to the North. It was later revealed that Jang had been actually appointed director of the Administration Department, an old agency of the Workers' Party abolished in 1990 and re-created by splitting the Organization Department. He was elected to the National Defence Commission in April 2009. He was made vice-chairman of the commission in summer 2010.\n\nDuring this period he was a close ally of Kim Jong-il. Jang was still in the post four years later, in April 2013. The NDC is North Korea's \"de facto\" supreme decision-making body; Jang's promotion made him a key executive deputy, second only to Kim Jong-il. It is speculated that the move was part of posturing to make Kim Jong-il's son Kim Jong-un the next leader of North Korea. Jang's position in North Korean politics was also ostensibly boosted by the death of Ri Je-gang, a senior leader who was tipped by Kim Jong-il as a crucial overseer of the succession campaign.\n\nOn 25 December 2011, North Korean television Sunday showed Jang in the uniform of a general. A Seoul official familiar with North Korea affairs said it was the first time Jang has been shown on state television in a military uniform. His appearance suggested that Jang had secured a key role in the North's military, which had pledged its allegiance to Kim Jong-un. Jang's importance continued to be demonstrated during his 2012 visit to China: various aspects of the visit echoed protocol which had previously been followed only for Kim Jong-il, including half of his entourage arriving ahead of time as an advance party, with the Chinese ambassador to North Korea, Liu Hongcai, returning to China beforehand to greet Jang upon his arrival.\n\nOn 17 August 2012, Jang met with China's premier, Wen Jiabao in Ziguangge, Zhongnanhai. He met with China's president Hu Jintao, Wang Jiarui, head of China's international department of the CPC central committee and minister in charge of the national development and reform commission, Zhang Ping, minister of finance Xie Xuren, minister of commerce Chen Deming, Liaoning provincial party chief Wang Min, Jilin provincial party chief Sun Zhengcai, and vice foreign minister Zhang Zhijun. He was the head of a delegation of the joint steering committee for developing and managing the Rason Economic and Trade Zone and the Hwanggumpyong and Wihwa Islands Economic Zone. In the announcement, he was listed as chief of the central administrative department of the Workers' Party of Korea, a member of the WPK political bureau, and vice-chairman of the National Defense Commission.\n\nJang said Kim Jong-un believed that bilateral relations with China are important and that the \"profound friendship will be passed on from generation to generation\" between China and North Korea. At the meeting with Wen, Jang said: \"The DPRK is willing to closely cooperate with China to accelerate relevant efforts and push forward cooperation in developing economic zones.\"\n\nOn 4 November 2012, the WPK Central Committee Politburo established a new State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission, appointing Jang as its first chairman. An analyst suggests that this quiet promotion may have signaled a decline in Jang's status: in North Korea, \"although sports can bring quick popularity, earn foreign exchange, raise patriotic fever, and help burn the energies of the youth and distract the masses from their daily hardships, it can never beat national security and socio-economic development in terms of its political significance. By asking Jang to chair the National Sports Commission, the young North Korean leader, less than a year into power, might have begun to nudge his uncle out of important policy deliberations.\"\n\nIn January 2013, speculation arose that Jang had been quietly promoted to top decision-making Politburo Presidium member, as his official hierarchy position was elevated, displacing then-Chief of General Staff Hyon Yong-chol and his own wife Kim Kyong-hui. An analyst argued that Jang might be appointed president of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly (making him the nominal head of state of the DPRK) or premier, replacing officeholders who were in their 80s. Jang Song-thaek promoted the construction of a new bridge over the Yalu River between the Chinese city of Dandong and the Korean city of Sinuiju. , the bridge was nearly completed. That same month, Jang was not invited to the meeting of top North Korean officials handling national security and foreign affairs, following a rocket launch on 12 December 2012, and new international sanctions in response. Following Jang's fall from power, an analyst noted that Jang's \"glaring absence\" at the January 2013 meeting \"signaled the emergence of a possible crack in the senior leadership, especially in the relationship between Kim and his all-powerful uncle, raising the possibility of divergent approaches between Kim and Jang\" on North Korea foreign policy.\n\nIn late May 2013, Choe Ryong-hae, a vice-chairman of Central Military Commission and director of the KPA General Political Department, was sent as Kim Jong-un's first special envoy to China, passing over Jang. An analyst viewed this as a \"striking\" choice, and noted that \"it appears that as the perceived 'China man in Pyongyang, Jang's \"perceived close ties with China may have done a disservice to his standing in the eyes of Kim, exposed him to criticism of being too subservient to China, and made him vulnerable to any anti-China backlash in Pyongyang\". Thought to have been particularly unacceptable to Kim Jong-un were Jang's \"continued expression of sympathy towards\" Kim Jong-nam—Kim Jong-un's half-brother and Kim Jong-il's eldest son—who was living in exile under Chinese protection at the time.\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", the final straw came from a dispute over control of North Korea's west coast fisheries. These had been partly taken from the military by Kim Jong-un in 2011, but later this decision was reversed and the fisheries were ordered returned to the military. Forces loyal to Jang defied the transfer, leading to a confrontation in late 2013, in which several North Korean soldiers loyal to Kim Jong-un were killed. Subsequent reinforcements sent by Kim Jong-un seized control of the fisheries.\n\nSoon after, in November 2013, Jang's senior aides Lee Yong-ha and Jang Soo-kee were executed. Lee was reportedly accused of abusing his authority, while Jang Soo-kee was found guilty of trying to organize a new faction and rejecting the system.\n\nJang had not been seen in public since. On 3 December he was dismissed from his post. On 7 December, his appearances were obscured or edited out from a news report (originally aired in October) that re-aired on Korean Central Television.\n\nOn 8 December, Jang Song-thaek was publicly expelled from the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), with state media attributing this to a decision of the Politburo. Jang was accused of having committed \"anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts\" that included illicit affairs with women; harboring \"politically-motivated ambition\"; weakening \"the party's guidance over judicial, prosecution and people's security bodies\" and obstructing \"the nation's economic affairs\".\n\nJang's arrest at a politburo meeting was broadcast on Korean Central Television, the state television broadcaster, in \"the most public dismissal... in history\" of a prominent North Korean official, and the first time since the 1970s that a senior politician was arrested in a party meeting on live television. \"Wen Wei Po\" reported that Lee Yun-keol (the chairman for the Seoul-based North Korea Strategy Information Service Center) stated that Kim Jong-chul (Kim Jong-un's elder brother) had personally led his guards to arrest Jang. Lee said that \"even Vice Marshal Choe Ryong-hae would not dare to carry out the arrest\" himself (some analysts believe this may signal an expanded role for Kim Jong-chul in the regime).\n\nA 2700-word statement was released, stating that the \"despicable human scum Jang, who was worse than a dog, perpetrated thrice-cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for him\". The statement detailed many charges against Jang, stating that he \"had desperately worked for years to destabilize and bring down the DPRK and grab the supreme power of the party and state by employing all the most cunning and sinister means and methods\". The statement accused Jang of freeing \"the undesirable and alien elements, including those who had been dismissed and relieved of their posts after being severely punished for disobeying the instructions of Kim Jong Il and \"let them work in the WPK CC [Korean Workers' Party Central Committee] Administrative Department and organs under it in a crafty manner\", which some analysts claim indicates that Jang had instigated a nationwide amnesty in January 2012 which included the closure of several North Korea prison camps and the release of prisoners. An analyst suggested that \"since most of the political prisoners freed at that time are now deemed as Jang's factionists, most of them are likely to be returned to jail again\". The statement accused Jang of bringing \"serious harm to the youth movement in the DPRK, being part of the group of renegades and traitors in the field of youth work, bribed by the enemies\".\n\nAn analyst believes that Choe Ryong-hae, \"the party-appointed shepherd of the North Korean youth for over a decade\" through his position in the Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League, linked Jang to this crime. The statement accused Jang of seeking to enlarge his own power, \"stretching his tentacles to all ministries and national institutions\" and turning the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee Administration Department, which Jang led, into a \"little kingdom which no one dares touch\"; Kim Jong-un disbanded the Administrative Department after Jang's fall. The statement also said that Jang had \"systematically denied the party line and policies, its organizational will\" as if he were \"a special being who could overrule either issues decided by the party or its line\" and that Jang had been \"disobeying the order of the Supreme Commander of the KPA\" (i.e. undermining Kim's rule). He was also accused of undermining the Kim personality cult, which included placing a granite monument carved with the supreme leader's words \"in a shaded corner\"; letting \"the decadent capitalist lifestyle find its way to our society by distributing all sorts of pornographic pictures among his confidants\"; and \"half-heartedly clapping, touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and people\" when one of Kim Jong-un's promotions was announced.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, Jang was tried by a special military tribunal of the Ministry of State Security and executed, according to state media.\n\nChinese media and North Korea experts suggested that Jang Song-thaek's fall reflected a rejection of his efforts to prioritize economic development, and a victory for North Korean advocates of a military-first policy. Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University, said Jang was \"the only one in the North who could talk about economic change. So, when I heard of Mr. Jang's execution, my first thought was that it was a death notice for those of us who have hoped for economic reform in the North.\"\n\nAnalysts of North Korean politics agreed that Jang's execution was the most significant since purges carried out in the 1950s by Kim Il-Sung, Kim Jong-un's grandfather and North Korea's founder; since 1960, purged top officials have not usually been killed, and the denunciations of purged figures have not typically been so extreme and public. Professor Charles K. Armstrong, an expert on North Korea at Columbia University, stated that \"although high-ranking leaders, including members of the Kim family, have been deposed before, we haven't seen anything this public or dramatic since Kim Jong-un's grandfather Kim Il-sung purged his last major rivals in the late 1950s. This seems to indicate the divisions within the Kim regime were more serious than previously thought.\" Former U.S. National Security Council director for Asian affairs Victor Cha said that the purge and execution of Jang \"tells you that everything's not normal ... When you take out Jang, you're not taking out just one person – you're taking out scores if not hundreds of other people in the system. It's got to have some ripple effect.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some analysts suggested that Jang's influence and role had been exaggerated. Professor Chung-in Moon from Yonsei University noted that there had been no policy shifts in the North Korean government and that some of Jang's closest associates, including Pak Pong-ju and Kang Sok-ju, had kept their positions. He also noted that Kim Jong-un's cabinet continued to emphasize economic incentive systems, innovation, and economic cooperation with China. Professor Chung-in said that \"He [Jang] could, therefore, have been purged and executed because of his obsession with material and organizational interests that challenged Kim Jong Un's reform initiative to streamline the country's economic management. If this turns out to be true, then Kim Jong Un should be seen as a reformer, whilst Jang was a reactionary.\" In another analysis he stressed that Jang's removal had not weakened the government, which was actually more stable than before: \"The politics of extensive surveillance, control, fear and intimidation are still alive and well. The party, the state, the military and security apparatus remain committed, effective and unified in purpose. The dramatic episode of Jang's downfall has created a formidable deterrent to any potential or actual opposing groups.\"\n\nFollowing Jang's fall, experts speculated that purges of other top figures might follow. An anonymous source said Ji Jae-ryong, North Korean ambassador to China and a close associate of Jang, \"will eventually be dealt with\"; however South Korean diplomatic sources said it was \"business as usual\" at that embassy. In early December, Pyongyang recalled two ambassadors: from Malaysia Jang's nephew Jang Yong-chol, from Cuba Jang's brother-in-law Jon Yong-jin. Deputy tourism minister Jo Sung-goyu, another Jang relative, canceled a planned trip to a tourism summit in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\n\nThe public received word of Jang's dismissal in the \"Rodong Sinmun\" on 12 December and were called to meetings to denounce Jang and pledge loyalty to Kim. Two days later, on 14 December, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released a roster of six top officials appointed to a national committee in charge of organizing a state funeral for Kim Kuk-tae (a former Workers' Party official who recently died). The roster included the names of Jang's widow (Kim Jong-un's aunt), Kim Kyong-hui, and vice-premier, Ro Du-chol, indicating both survived the purge and remained in favor. KCNA and \"Rodong Sinmun\" began erasing references to Jang \"as completely as possible\", deleting some 100,000 and 20,000 news items from their websites, respectively.\n\nThe status of Kim Kyong-hui's relationship with Jang had been a subject of frequent speculation. Analysts believe that Jang and Kim Kyong-hui had been estranged. Yoon Sang-hyun, a National Assembly of South Korea deputy floor leader of the governing Saenuri Party, had said previously that Kim had been \"separated\" from Jang and did not oppose his purge. Following the execution, \"Chosun Ilbo\" reported that Choe Ryong-hae may now be the \"number 2 man\" in North Korea. The South Korean newspaper reported claims that Kim Jong-il \"asked Choe on his deathbed to help his son Jong-un\" but that the North Korean military disapproves of Choe.\n\nIn January 2014, the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported that the purge had extended to Jang's family, with all his relatives, including children, being rounded up and executed. According to a South Korean newspaper, Jang's nephew, O Sang-hon, was executed by being burnt alive with a flame thrower.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54425426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54425426", "title": "Litham", "text": "Litham\n\nLitham (, sometimes pronounced lifam) is a mouth-veil which the Bedouin, particularly men, have traditionally used to cover the lower part of their face.\n\nThe litham has served as protection from the dust and extremes of temperature characterizing the desert environment. In cases of blood feuds, it also served as protection against violence by making the wearer difficult to recognize. Wearing of the litham is not viewed as a religious requirement, although it was apparently believed to provide magical protection against evil forces. It is included among the garments which pilgrims are forbidden to wear by the Islamic doctrine in the ritual state of \"ihram\".\n\nAncient African rock engravings depicting human faces with eyes but no mouth or nose suggest that the origins of litham are not only pre-Islamic but even pre-historic. The litham was commonly worn among the Berber Sanhaja tribes in north-west Africa. Its use by the Almoravids, who originated from a Sanhaja clan, gave it a political significance during their conquests in the 11th and 12th centuries. This practice gave rise to Almoravids being pejoratively nicknamed \"al-mulaththamun\" (the muffled ones). The Almohads, who succeeded the Almoravids as the dominant dynasty in the North African region, opposed the practice of wearing the litham, claiming that it is forbidden for men to imitate women's dress, but they never managed to suppress its use. \n\nAmong the Tuareg, men wear the litham, also called \"tagulmust\", while women go unveiled. Tuareg boys start wearing the litham at the onset of puberty and the veil is regarded as a mark of manhood. It is considered improper for a man to appear unveiled in front of elders, especially those from his wife's family. The Tuareg litham is made of several pieces of Sudanese cloth which are sewn together to yield a strip about four yards long.\n\nA number of legends were invented to explain the custom of male veiling. According to one, the wearers of litham descended from members of the Umayyad family, who escaped to Africa disguised as women after the fall of the Umayyad dynasty, and never took off the veil. When one fell in battle and lost his litham, his friends could not recognize him until it was put back on. The word \"litham\" and its derivatives have been widely used in Arabic literature, in particular by the poets, who commonly employed puns between the general meaning of \"litham\" as veil and the verbal root \"lathama\", which means \"to kiss\". In \"One Thousand and One Nights\" women use the litham to disguise themselves as men. The classical dictionary \"Lisan al-Arab\" by Ibn Manzur treats \"lifam\" as a separate word, describing it as a mouth veil worn by women.\n\n"}

{"id": "30581640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30581640", "title": "Pillbox (military)", "text": "Pillbox (military)\n\nA pillbox is a type of blockhouse, or concrete dug-in guard post, normally equipped with loopholes through which to fire weapons. It is in effect a trench firing step hardened to protect against small-arms fire and grenades and raised to improve the field of fire.\n\nThe origin of the term is disputed. It has been widely assumed to be a jocular reference to the perceived similarity of the fortifications to the cylindrical and hexagonal boxes in which medical pills were once sold. However, it seems more likely that it originally alluded to pillar boxes, with a comparison being drawn between the loophole on the pillbox and the letter-slot on the pillar box.\n\nThe term is found in print in \"The Times\" on 2 August 1917, following the beginning of the Third Battle of Ypres; and in \"The Scotsman\" on 17 September 1917, following the German withdrawal onto the Hindenburg Line. Other unpublished occurrences have been found in war diaries and similar documents of about the same date; and in one instance, as \"Pillar Box\", as early as March 1916.\n\nThe concrete nature of pillboxes means that they are a feature of prepared positions. Some pillboxes were designed to be prefabricated and transported to their location for assembly. During World War I, Sir Ernest William Moir produced a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof. Around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with blocks cast at Richborough in Kent) and sent to the Western Front in 1918.\n\nPillboxes are often camouflaged in order to conceal their location and to maximize the element of surprise. They may be part of a trench system, form an interlocking line of defence with other pillboxes by providing covering fire to each other (defence in depth), or they may be placed to guard strategic structures such as bridges and jetties.\n\nThe French Maginot Line built between the world wars consisted of a massive bunker and tunnel complex, but as most of it was below ground little could be seen from the ground level. The exception were the concrete blockhouses, gun turrets, pillboxes and cupolas which were placed above ground to allow the garrison of the Maginot line to engage an attacking enemy.\n\nBetween the Abyssinian Crisis of 1936 and World War II, the British built about 200 pillboxes on the island of Malta for defence in case of an Italian invasion. Fewer than 100 pillboxes still exist, and most are found on the northeastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed nowadays as the authorities do not consider them to have any architectural or historic value, despite heritage NGOs calling to preserve them.\n\nAbout 28,000 pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications were constructed in England in 1940 as part of the British anti-invasion preparations of World War II. About 6,500 of these structures still survive.\n\nPillboxes for the Czechoslovak border fortifications were built before World War II in Czechoslovakia in defence against a German attack. None of these were actually used against their intended enemy during the German invasion, but some were used against the advancing Soviet armies in 1945. The Japanese also made use of pillboxes in their fortifications of Iwo Jima.\n\nPillboxes were hard to defeat and required artillery, anti-tank weapons or grenades to overcome.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "229052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229052", "title": "Qilin", "text": "Qilin\n\nThe qilin (; ), or kirin in Japanese, is a mythical hooved chimerical creature known in Chinese and other East Asian cultures, said to appear with the imminent arrival or passing of a sage or illustrious ruler. Qilin is a specific type of the \"lin\" mythological family of one-horned beasts. \n\nThe earliest references to the \"qilin\" are in the 5th century BC \"Zuo Zhuan\". The \"qilin\" made appearances in a variety of subsequent Chinese works of history and fiction, such as Feng Shen Bang. Emperor Wu of Han apparently captured a live \"qilin\" in 122 BC, although Sima Qian was skeptical of this.\n\nIn legend, the \"qilin\" became a stylized representation of the giraffe in the Ming dynasty. The identification of the qilin with giraffes began after Zheng He's voyage to East Africa (landing, among other places, in modern-day Somalia). The Ming Dynasty bought giraffes from the Somali merchants along with zebras, incense, and various other exotic animals. Zheng He's fleet brought back two giraffes to Nanjing, and they were referred to as \"qilins\". The Emperor proclaimed the giraffes magical creatures, whose capture signaled the greatness of his power.\n\nThe identification between the qilin and the giraffe is supported by some attributes of the qilin, including its vegetarianism and quiet nature. Its reputed ability to \"walk on grass without disturbing it\" may be related to the giraffe's long, thin legs. Also the qilin is described as having antlers like a deer and scales like a dragon or fish; since the giraffe has horn-like \"ossicones\" on its head and a tessellated coat pattern that looks like scales it is easy to draw an analogy between the two creatures. The identification of qilin with giraffes has had lasting influence: even today, the same word is used for the mythical animal and the giraffe in both Korean and Japanese.\n\nThe \"qilin\" may be described or depicted in a variety of ways. \n\n\"Qilin\" generally have Chinese dragon-like features. Most notably their heads, eyes with thick eyelashes, manes that always flow upward and beards. The body is fully or partially scaled and often shaped like an ox, deer, or horse. They are always shown with cloven hooves. In modern times, the depictions of \"qilin\" have often fused with the Western concept of unicorns.\n\nThe Chinese dragon has antlers, so it is most common to see \"qilin\" with antlers. Dragons in China are also most commonly depicted as golden, therefore the most common depictions of qilin are also golden, but are not limited to just gold, and can be any color of the rainbow, multicolored, and various colors of fur or hide.\n\nThe \"qilin\" are depicted throughout a wide range of Chinese art also with parts of their bodies on fire, but not always. Sometimes they have feathery features or decorations, fluffy curly tufts of hair like Ming Dynasty horse art on various parts of the legs from fetlocks to upper legs, or even with decorative fish-like fins as decorative embellishments, or carp fish whiskers, or even carp fish-like dragon scales.\n\nQilin are often depicted as somewhat bejeweled, or as brilliant as jewels themselves, like Chinese dragons. They are often associated in colors with the elements, precious metals, stars, and gem stones. But, \"qilin\" can also be earthy and modest browns or earth-tones. \nIt is said their auspicious voice sounds like the tinkling of bells, chimes, and the wind.\n\nAccording to Taoist mythology, although they can look fearsome, \"qilin\" only punish the wicked, thus there are several variations of court trials and judgements based on qilin divinely knowing whether a defendant was good or evil, and guilty or innocent, in ancient lore and stories.\n\nIn Buddhist influenced depictions, they will refuse to walk upon grass for fear of harming a single blade, and thus are often depicted walking upon the clouds or the water. As they are divine and peaceful creatures, their diets do not include flesh. They take great care when they walk to never tread on a living creature, and appear only in areas ruled by a wise and benevolent leader, which can include a household. They can become fierce if a pure person is threatened by a malicious one, spouting flames from their mouths and exercising other fearsome powers that vary from story to story.\n\nLegends tell that qilin have appeared in the garden of the legendary Yellow Emperor and in the capital of Emperor Yao. Both events bore testimony to the benevolent nature of the rulers. It has been told in legends that the birth of the great sage Confucius was foretold by the arrival of a qilin.\n\nQilin are thought to be a symbol of luck, good omens, protection, prosperity, success, and longevity by the Chinese.\nQilin are also a symbol of fertility, and often depicted in decorations as bringing a baby to a family.\n\nSome stories state that qilin are sacred pets (or familiars) of the deities. Therefore, in the hierarchy of dances performed by the Chinese (lion dance, dragon dance, etc.), they rank highly; third only to the dragon and phoenix who are the highest.\n\nIn the qilin dance, movements are characterized by fast, powerful strokes of the head. The Qilin Dance is often regarded as a hard dance to perform due to the weight of the head, the stances involved, and the emphasis on sudden bursts of energy (Chinese:  ,  ,  \"fǎjìn\").\n\nQilin (麒麟) is often translated into English as \"unicorn\" as it can sometimes be depicted as having a single horn, although this is misleading as qilin may also be depicted as having two horns. A separate word () is used in modern Chinese for \"unicorns\". A number of different Chinese mythical creatures can be depicted with a single horn, and a qilin, even if depicted with one horn, would be called a \"one-horned qilin\" in Chinese, not a \"unicorn\".\n\nIt is because of the whimsical, supernatural, mythical, mystical, and religious similarities in antiquity to the Western unicorns that the Chinese government minted coins in silver and gold several times depicting both the qilin and the Western Unicorn together.\n\nThere are variations in the appearance of the qilin, even in historical China, owing to cultural differences between dynasties and regions.\n\nDuring the Jin dynasty, the qilin was depicted as wreathed in flame and smoke, with a dragon-like head, scales, and the body of a powerful hooved beast such as a horse.\n\nIn the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the qilin was represented as an oxen-hoofed animal with a dragon-like head surmounted by a pair of horns and flame-like head ornaments.\n\nThe qilin of China's subsequent Manchu Qing dynasty (1644–1911) was a fanciful animal. Depictions of the qilin show a creature with the head of a dragon, the antlers of a deer, the skin and scales of a fish, the hooves of an ox and tail of a lion.\n\n\"Girin\", \"Kirin\", or 기린 is the Korean form of \"qilin\". It is described as a maned creature with the torso of a deer, an ox tail with the hooves of a horse. The qilin in Korean art were initially depicted as more deer-like, however over time they have transformed into more horse-like. They were one of the four divine creatures along with the dragon, phoenix and turtle. Qilin were extensively used in Korean royal and Buddhist arts.\n\nIn modern Korean, the term \"girin\" is used for \"giraffe\".\n\nIn Thailand, the Qílín is known as 'Gilen' (Thai; กิเลน), and is a member of the pantheon of Thai Himapant forest mythical animals. It is most probable that the Gilen was introduced into the pantheon under the influence of the Tai Yai who came down from Southern China to settle in Siam in ancient times, and the legend was probably incorporated into the Himapant legends of Siam in this manner. The Gilen is a mixture of various animals, which come from differing elemental environments, representing elemental magical forces present within each personified creature. Many of the Himapant animals actually represent gods and devas of the Celestial Realms, and bodhisattvas, who manifest as personifications which represent the true nature of each creature deity through the symbolism of the various body parts amalgamated into the design of the Mythical creature.\n\nKirin is the Japanese form of \"qilin\", which has also come to be used in the modern Japanese word for a giraffe. Japanese art tends to depict the kirin as more deer-like than in Chinese art. Alternatively, it is depicted as a dragon shaped like a deer, but with an ox's tail instead of a lion's tail. The Kirin Brewery Company, Ltd., is named after the animal and uses a picture of one in its labels. They are also often portrayed as partially unicorn-like in appearance, but with a backwards curving horn.\n\nIn the Post-Qin Chinese hierarchy of mythological animals, the qilin is ranked as the third most powerful creature (after the dragon and phoenix), but in Japan, the kirin occupies the top spot. This is following the style of the ancient Chinese, as qilin was ranked higher than the dragon or phoenix before the Qin dynasty. During the Zhou dynasty, the qilin was ranked the highest, the phoenix ranked second, and the dragon the third.\n\nIn Vietnam, the Qilin is referred to as the 'Kỳ lân Trung Hoa', or simplified as 'Kỳ lân'. The origins of the Kỳ lân is descended from the Chinese Qilin, and shares many similar features, such as the head of a dragon or tiger, mane of a lion, the hooves of an ox or horse, the tail of a lion or ox, scales of a fish, and it can have either 1 or 2 horns or antlers.\n\nThe qilin has been frequently depicted in works of literature and art:\n\n"}

He was alleged to be part of the Soviet espionage group known as the \"Golos ring\".\n\nMiller was born April 5, 1910, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and lived in Baltimore, Maryland. In August 1934, he moved to Moscow and worked as a correspondent for the \"Chattanooga News\" until 1937. In Moscow, Miller met and married his wife, Jenny Levy, an American. In 1937, Miller became press agent for the Spanish Republican government. In 1939, the Millers moved to New York City, and Miller became President of the Hemisphere News Service and editor of its weekly publication, \"Hemisphere\". Jack Fahy, another suspected spy for the Soviet Union, was Vice President and Treasurer. Miller was known to be meeting with Jacob Golos as early as February 1941 in New York. Sometime that same year, the Millers relocated to Washington D.C. so that he could take employment as an analyst for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) in the Department of Commerce at a good salary. He later became Director of the Division of Reports of the OCIAA. About this time, Miller allegedly began supplying information to Elizabeth Bentley for the Golos network. Miller had access to information from the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), Army G-2 (Intelligence), the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), and the FBI concerning Latin American affairs. The material Miller allegedly provided Bentley for transmission to Soviet intelligence always concerned Communist or Russian activities in Latin America.\n\nIn September 1941, the Hemisphere News Service moved to Washington D.C. and became the Export Information Bureau, managed by Joseph Gregg, and received a contract to do exclusive research work for the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. At the same time, Robert Miller became a research analyst with the OCIAA. The Export Information Bureau was subsequently absorbed into the CIAA.\n\nIn December 1941, Miller was interviewed by D.M. Ladd of the FBI about a request to investigate several individuals and organizations for OCIAA, including an organization called the \"Society for Pan-American Confraternity\". In February 1942, at the request of Undersecretary James Forrestal, FBI Special Agent Jerry Doyle had lunch with John Nitze, a former employee of Forrestal. Nitze was accompanied by Miller, who was described as being in charge of intelligence for the OCIAA. Nitze explained that Miller provided intelligence reports for both the Board of Economic Warfare (BEW) and the OCIAA which were prepared from information supplied by the FBI, Office of Naval Intelligence and Army G-2.\n\nIn July 1944, Miller transferred to the Near Eastern Division of the United States Department of State and handled confidential matters between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. By August 1944, it was established Miller had a connection with Greg Silvermaster, head of the Silvermaster group. Miller was also a close associate of Maurice Halperin, who worked for the OSS, State Department, and Soviet intelligence. Charles Flato of the Office of Economic warfare and the Foreign Economic Administration was also one of Miller's contacts.\n\nMiller resigned from the State Department in December 1946. According to Anatoly Gorsky's memo, \"Failures in the U.S.A. (1938–1948),\" December 1948: in Alexander Vassiliev's Notes from the KGB Archive.

The symbols generally draw inspiration from old ornamental traditions such as duodji and the \"runes\" of the traditional shaman's drums. The symbols generally don't follow the rules of tincture, as the \"sámi national colours\" are traditionally placed colour on colour.\n\n\"See: Sami flag\"\n\nThough the highest ranking symbol, the flag does not symbolize any particular institution. It is, however, as of 1986 the official flag of all Sámi in all countries and a recognized flag in Norway. Hence, it is used by most important Sámi institutions. The flag is a combination of an old, unofficial flag and an often-used sun/moon symbol of the shaman's drum. It is inspired by a mythological poem claiming the Sámi to be \"children of the Sun\".\n\nWith the creation of this flag, the \"national colours\" of the Sámi were defined as red, green, yellow and blue. All of these are heraldic colours, except yellow which is a metal (\"ore\") in heraldic terms.\n\nThe Sámi Council, which organizes Sámi NGOs at the international level has a symbol that predates the Sámi flag. In appearance it is similar to the arppa - a chain of rings used together with shaman's drums to predict the future. It symbolizes unity between Sámi of the four states.\n\nThe logo of the Sámi Parliament of Norway draws the least inspiration from the Sámi flag. It represents the parliament building seen from above, with the main corpus marked in grey and the hall of parliament in red. However, the building is designed to suggest the sun/moon symbol when seen from above.\n\nThe logo of the Sámi Parliament of Sweden features a circle in the four Sámi colours. The circle is striped in resemblance of a shaman's drum's sun-symbol. Within the circle there is a runic symbol resembling an arrow pointing southwest.\n\nThe logo of the Sámi Parliament of Finland features a red circle with a yellow line at the bottom (inside the circle) and four blue lines radiating from it - symbolizing the sun. The four lines represent the four Sámi groups of Finland, and the three colours are that of the first Sámi flag. The green colour was originally added to represent the South Sámi, who are not native to Finland.\n\nThe elected Council of Plenipotentiary Representatives of the Sámi of Murmansk Province uses a symbol heavily inspired by the flag: two reindeer horns joined like a crescent, the upper half red and the lower half blue, between the halves are two stripes in yellow and green. The official Centre for Indigenous People in Murmansk Province, under which the official Council of Indigenous Peoples under the [Provincial] Government operates, uses a logo also inspired by the flag: a circle, left half blue and right half red, at the centre of which is a brown lávvu, a blue line symbolizing water, and a multicoloured line symbolizing the Aurora Borealis, the colours of the latter being from left to right red, yellow, green and blue.\n\n\"Finnmárkuopmodat\", the autonomous entity established by the Finnmark Act has a logo that according to the entity's website \"gets it colours from the Sámi and the Norwegian flag, as a symbol that the Finnmark Estate feels related to and responsible for both Sámi, kvens and ethnic Norwegians. (...) The circular shape... refers both to the Sámi flag's sun-symbol and to the solid and safe envelopment of a circle. (...) It is opened up to allow the Northern Lights a gateway into the Norwegian and the Sámi flag's colours.\"\n"}

{"id": "5828847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5828847", "title": "Strategic communication", "text": "Strategic communication\n\nStrategic communication can mean either communicating a concept, a process, or data that satisfies a long term strategic goal of an organization by allowing facilitation of advanced planning, or communicating over long distances usually using international telecommunications or dedicated global network assets to coordinate actions and activities of operationally significant commercial, non-commercial and military business or combat and logistic subunits. It can also mean the related function within an organization, which handles internal and external communication processes. Strategic communication can also be used for political warfare.\n\nStrategic communication refers to policy-making and guidance for consistent information activity within an organization and between organizations. Equivalent business management terms are: integrated (marketing) communication, organizational communication, corporate communication, institutional communication, etc. (see paragraph on 'Commercial Application' below).\n\nIn the U.S. government context, strategic communication has been defined as \"Focused United States Government efforts to understand and engage key audiences to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of United States Government interests, policies, and objectives through the use of coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national power.\"\n\nStrategic communication management could be defined as the systematic planning and realization of information flow, communication, media development and image care in a long-term horizon. It conveys deliberate message(s) through the most suitable media to the designated audience(s) at the appropriate time to contribute to and achieve the desired long-term effect. Communication management is process creation. It has to bring three factors into balance: the message(s), the media channel(s) and the audience(s).\n\nAn alternative view of strategic communication is offered by Steve Tatham of the UK Defence Academy. He argues that whilst it is desirable to bound and coordinate communications together - particularly from governments or the military - it should be regarded in a much more fundamental manner than simply process. The 'informational effect' should be placed at the very epi-centre of command and that all action must be calibrated against that effect - including the evaluation of 2nd and 3rd order effects. This is, he argues, proper Strategic Communication (communication singular — an abstract noun) whilst the actual process of communicating (which include Target Audience Analysis, evaluation of conduits, measurements of effect etc.) — is Strategic Communications (plural).\n\nIn the August 2008 paper, \"DoD Principles of Strategic Communication,\" Robert T. Hastings, Jr., acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, described strategic communication as \"the synchronization of images, actions and words to achieve a desired effect.\"\n\nCommunication is strategic when it is completely consistent with the organisation mission, vision, values and when it is able to enhance the strategic positioning and competitiveness between their competitors. It is important to understand the concept of communication strategy, it should be seen from the organization’s perspective and no one else beside them. As a result of this communication, strategic communication should follow ‘The nature of organisational communication in general, and strategic communication in particular, is defined as the purposeful use of communication by an organisation to fulfill its mission’ stated by (Hallahan et al., 2007). Therefore, the Strategic Communications Framework should be lay out to aim the objectives of communicating to the audience/organisation. The deliberate application of the specific content will help achieve the business goal clearly. While communication is something that does happen in the organisation, businesses that take steps to implement sound strategies impacting the effectiveness of their business communications can achieve measurable results. According to Mulhern(2009), Technological advancement have been a huge factor in business meaning that information can be communicated through many diverse channels and media like the internet and through ads. Technology have been rapidly growing throughout the year pretty fast, accelerating communication that allow customers to connect and communicate with others. This will make it easier for them to reach to each other in a traditional communication way that suit the demand of their needs. ‘These changes mean that marketers are in a far more challenging competitive environment in attempting to fulfil customers wants and needs, while simultaneously seeking to develop long-term relationships’( Mulhern, 2009). Having changes in communication will help communication goals, organisation, and communication channels. This will have an effect of measuring the effectiveness of the communication tactics used in a business for their audience. To start a business no matter how small it is, communication strategy should be a goal to start with and it will indicate the future of the business. A business that communicate with their employees about benefit options will have increased the level of trust between them.\n\nStrategic communication provides a conceptual umbrella that enables organizations to integrate their disparate messaging efforts. It allows them to create and distribute communications that, while different in style and purpose, have an inner coherence. This consistency can, in some instances, foster an echo chamber that reinforces the organizational message and brand. At minimum, it prevents contradictory, confusing messaging to different groups across all media platforms.\n\nTo have an object, the first thing to do is have a plan for the business to communicate how the business is formed and to see how strong its core is. Ensure that alignment with the organization’s understanding of where it is currently at. An approach that could be used to determine the current state of the objective, is to do a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. When using a SWOT analysis, the strengths and weaknesses must be realistic. This is to help make improvements or adjustments that were not so good. The analysis will help get a better understanding of the business and will help plan and make the objectives more solid because it shows the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats the business is facing. This helps decide where the business is today, and where it will be in the future.\nPlanning is a continuous process of research and analysis, task analysis, execution, and assessment. Success in this process requires diligent and continual analysis, and assessment being fed back into planning and actions.\n\nHave interviews with the customers to learn their priorities and what goals they want to achieve with the organization. Having a good understanding of the business issues, this will allow the organisation to offer effective solutions that will help the objective. Ask questions to see what the customer’s aim is, with the main goal to focus on what needs to be achieved and done and not what he/ or she wants. ‘Sustainability calls for a value chain approach, whereby firms need to take wider responsibility and collaborate with a range of stakeholders to ensure that unsustainable practices are addressed’ (Scandelius, & Cohen,2015).\n\nObjectives should have a specific end points to provide an indicator of success. Kotler et al., (2013) stated by understanding the consumer and the marketplace, he or she can design a marketing strategy. To have an understanding to what is happening around the organisation will ensure that planning the marketing strategy will be easy because the vision is there and making sure the objectives are SMART. Objectives are the intended goals of a business campaigns, to show what is achievable. The objectives are effective when using SMART goals: they need to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. Have assignments for individuals or groups so the responsibilities for each of these objectives are already set and no adjustments are needed because they have been assigned to a specific person or group. The responsibility is in their hands. This is to indicate the specific individual or group have a direct preliminary objective they are assigned to. They will need to develop a range of possible strategies and tactics to achieve the objectives given to them.\n\nBrainstorm a list of potential strategies achievable for each of the objectives given out by the business and its customers, and have tactics that will support these strategies and objectives. Gather as a team to discuss the merits of each proposed strategy to the organisation. The discussion must be about the strategies that will most likely be able to be used and those that are unlikely to be used. Some strategies will not be achievable, will be difficult or no solution will be available for it so these will be crossed of the list. This shortens the list and helps to round up the best strategies left to be used. Collectively decide which strategies and tactics are going to be pursued to provide a clear objective for the business. The main focus is to achieve the objectives that were given out by the organisation.\n\nHave the detail behind those strategies and tactics name out so that there is a clear objective and what is needed to be focus on. Explain how it will be successful, how it is measured, the time frame and who will be responsible. To ensure that everything is successfully plan out and the success of these strategies and tactics. To do this planning wisely is a key part, planning does not only help a business achieve the objective but also help with communication within the group. Everyone will be assigned to a responsibility so that these strategies and tactics are meet.\n\nThe recently approved NATO Policy on Strategic Communication defines Strategic Communication as \"the coordinated and appropriate use of NATO communications activities and capabilities – Public Diplomacy, Military Public Affairs, Information Operations and Psychological Operations, as appropriate – in support of Alliance policies, operations and activities, and in order to advance NATO's aims\" (SG(2009)0794). \"It is important to underline that Strategic Communication is first and foremost a process that supports and underpins all efforts to achieve the Alliance's objectives; an enabler that guides and informs our decisions, and not an organization\nin itself. It is for this reason that Strategic Communication considerations should be integrated into the earliest planning phases - communication activities being a consequence of that planning\" (MCM-0164-2009).\n\nStrategic Communication is communication aligned with the company's overall strategy, to enhance its strategic positioning.\n\nStrategic communication is currently subject to multinational CD&E, led by the military, because communication is always an indispensable part of crisis management and compliance strategies. Across the spectrum of missions and broadly covering all levels of involvement in a civil-military, comprehensive approach context, the function of Strategic Communication and its military tool for implementation – Information Operations – have evolved and are still under development, in particular concerning their exact delineation of responsibilities and the integration of non-military and non-coalition actors.\n\nThree major lines of development are acknowledged as state of the art, with practical impact on current crisis management operations and/or multinational interoperability: (1) U.S. national developments, which one can argue have resulted in the most mature concepts for both Strategic Communication and Information Operations so far; (2) NATO concept development, which in the case of Strategic Communication is very much driven by current mission requirements (such as ISAF in Afghanistan), but also has benefitted much from multinational CD&E in the case of Information Operations; and (3) multinational CD&E projects such as the U.S.-led Multinational Experiment (MNE) series and the Multinational Information Operations Experiment (MNIOE), led by Germany.\n\nIntensive discussions involving civil and military practitioners of Strategic Communication and Information Operations - with a view on existing national and NATO approaches to Strategic Communication, and current best practice - have questioned whether a new approach and definition of Strategic Communication really is required. Consequently, a reorientation of CD&E efforts was suggested, focussing now on the theme of \"Integrated Communication\", which better reflects the shared baseline assessment with a broader scope, including but not limited to Strategic Communication:\n\n\nThis change also should prevent false expectations of potential customers of resulting concepts who currently are reluctant to engage in CD&E on the widely implemented subject of Strategic Communication.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4459211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4459211", "title": "Tampuan people", "text": "Tampuan people\n\nThe Tampuan (also spelled Tompuan or Tampuon) are an indigenous ethnic group living in northeast Cambodia. Numbering about 31,000, the Tampuan people live in the mountainous Southern and Western portions of the Cambodian province of Ratanakiri. They have their own language of the Mon–Khmer language family.\n\nTampuans, along with the other Mon-Khmer groups of the mountains, are referred to as Khmer Loeu (\"Upper Khmer\") by the Khmer majority. In English, montagnards, a designation given to all hilltribes in the former French Indochina is often used. Though historically their language has been without a writing system, in the last ten years an NGO has overseen the creation of a writing system, based on the Cambodian alphabet. However, fewer than 80% of Tampuans are literate.\n\nThe Tampuan people are a mountain people, living in communal villages that range from 100 to 400 inhabitants. The villages are often laid out in a square, with a communal house (Tampuan: ), in the center. Today many Tampuan villages have a communal well, volleyball court, or rice mill in the center as well. In addition to a village home, most Tampuans have a second residence on their farm.\n\nHouses are built on three- to 6-foot-tall () stilts to catch cool breezes. The walls, floor, roof and doors are made of split woven bamboo. Normally, houses are rectangular in shape, averaging five meters by three meters. Today, many rich Tampuans build wooden houses with corrugated steel roofs, a mark of luxury. In some areas, Tampuans live in communal longhouses that can be up to in length.\n\nTampuans have a matrilineal system of marriage, with the family name and inheritance passing through the mother’s side of the family. Normally, Tampuans marry between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. In accordance with tradition, the young couple lives with and serves the family of the bride for three years, and then moves to serve the grooms family for an additional three years. At this point, the young couple is considered to be of age, capable of starting their own farm. Bigamy is tolerated but not common.\nThe average married Tampuan woman bears six to eight children in her lifetime, but due to high infant mortality rates and poor medical care, fewer than six usually survive to adulthood.\n\nThe Tampuan diet consists almost entirely of rice, supplemented by fish or stewed vegetables. Though Tampuans may raise chickens, pigs, dogs, cows, and water buffalo for food, the meat is rarely eaten apart from an animistic religious sacrifice. Tampuans also use crossbows or guns to hunt wild boars, pheasants, deer and small rodents. Bugs and ants are often consumed as snacks. Tampuans hold a number of foods to be taboo, according to the clan into which one is born.\n\nNearly all Tampuans are subsistence farmers, practicing a form of rotational slash and burn agriculture. The land surrounding the village is communally owned, with each village member planting on his designated section. When the nutrients on a particular plot of land are depleted, usually after two or three years, a new plot is cleared, burned, and prepared for planting. The previous plot is left to lie fallow for a period of years. The vast majority of Tampuans plant dry-land rice.\n\nTampuans are animists, believing that spirits inhabit all things. Spirits, and especially evil spirits, must be appeased through animal sacrifices. Violating the evil spirit’s commands causes sickness. Mediums and sorcerers are common, and are paid to speak the will of the spirits.\n\nThe Tampuans are a very musical people. They learn from a young age to play fiddles, stringed banjos, drums, flutes, and gongs. Gongs are their most important instruments. The gongs are made of hammered bronze, and consist of a set of five for rhythm and another set of eight for the melody. Playing gongs is a communal affair; thirteen men play gongs and two play percussion. Often the gongs are accompanied by dancing. Traditionally, men play instruments and women sing.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6010248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6010248", "title": "Turks of Western Thrace", "text": "Turks of Western Thrace\n\nTurks of Western Thrace (, ) are ethnic Turks who live in Western Thrace, in the province of East Macedonia and Thrace in Northern Greece.\n\nAccording to the Greek census of 1991, there were approximately 50,000 Turks in Western Thrace, out of the approximately 98,000 strong Muslim minority of Greece. Other sources estimate the size of the Turkish community between 90,000 and 120,000. The Turks of Western Thrace are not to be confused with Pomaks nor with Muslim Roma people of the same region, counting 35% and 15% of the Muslim minority respectively.\n\nDue to the multiethnic character of the Muslim minority of Greece, which includes Turks, Pomaks and Roma Muslims, the Government of Greece does not refer to it by a specific ethnic background, nor does recognize any of these ethnicities, including the Turks, as separate ethnic minority in Western Thrace, instead referring to the whole Muslim minority on religious grounds, as the \"Muslim Minority of Western Thrace\" or \"Greek Muslims\". This is in accordance with the Treaty of Lausanne to which Greece, along with Turkey, is a signature member. The Lausanne Treaty, along with the Greek Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, enshrines the fundamental rights of the Turks and other ethnic groups of East Macedonia and Thrace and the obligations towards them.\n\nParts of Western Thrace were overrun by the expanding Ottoman Empire in 1354 and remained in Ottoman control until 1913. At this year, the Turkish community outnumbered the Greek community four to one and owned close to 84% of the land. By August 31, 1913 the Turks of Western Thrace had formed the first 'Turkish republic', the Provisional Government of Western Thrace. However, it was taken over by the Kingdom of Bulgaria on October 25, 1913, which had been victorious in the First Balkan War. France occupied the area at the end of the First World War, following the defeat of Bulgaria, and it passed into Greek hands under the Treaty of Sèvres in August 1920. Under a protocol of the same year, the Turks of Western Thrace were exempted from the 1922-1923 exchange of populations agreement between Greece and Turkey and were granted rights within the framework of the Lausanne Treaty. However, since 1923, between 300,000 and 400,000 Turks have left Western Thrace most of which have immigrated to Turkey. It should be emphasised that the actual Ottoman-era Greek Muslims of Macedonia had been included among those 'Turks' expatriated to Turkey in 1924. including the Vallahades. In contrast, the Western Thrace Turks are completely distinct from those referred to as Greek Muslims and were exempt from the terms of the population exchange.\n\nA number of estimates and censuses during the 1912-1920 period gave the following results about the ethnic distribution of the area that would become known as Western Thrace:\n\nThe Pomak population depending on the source was sometimes counted together with the Turks according to the Ottoman system of classifying people depending on religion, while in other occasions was specified separately. On the other hand, according to the Bulgarian view, they are considered \"Bulgarian Muslims\" and an integral part of the Bulgarian nation.\n\nAccording to the Turkish thesis, as it was presented at Lausanne Peace Conference (1920), the general distribution of population in Western Thrace was as follows:\n\nDuring Ottoman rule before 1912, Greeks constituted a minority in the region of Western Thrace. After the Balkan Wars and World War I the demography of the region was changed. While groups such as the Turks and Bulgarians decreased, the Greek population increased by the resettlement of ten thousands of Greek refugees from other areas of the Ottoman Empire, after the flight of the Greek refugees from Asia Minor, as a result of the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), the Greek Genocide and the subsequent population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Of all Greek Asia Minor refugees (around 1.2 million), 8% of them were resettled in Western Thrace.\nThe Greek government's reason to settle the refugees in this region was to strengthen the Greek presence in the newly acquired provinces and the homogenization of the population. The Greek government especially resettled the refugees in Komotini, Xanthi and Sapes regions where the majority of Muslim Turks lived.\n\nThe Turkish community has a strong presence in the Komotini () and Xanthi () departments of East Macedonia and Thrace, while it is scarcely present in the Evros prefecture, the closest to the international boundary with Turkey. According to estimates, Muslims as a whole, represented 36-38% of the Rhodopi Department population, 12-24% in the Xanthi Department and less than 5% in the Evros Department.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, in 1976 the Turkish language was spoken by 128,000 people in Greece, the majority of whom are located in the Western Thrace portion of the province of East Macedonia and Thrace. However, the Greek language is also widely used.\n\nArticle 37 through 45 of the Lausanne Treaty set forth the obligations of the Greek and Turkish governments to protect the Turkish and Greek minorities in their territories. Each country agreed to provide the following:\n\n\nThe Lausanne Treaty defined the rights of the Muslim communities in Western Thrace, on the basis of religion, not ethnicity, as well as maintained a balance between the minority communities of both countries (Turks in Greece and Greeks in Turkey) on reciprocal obligations toward each of those minorities. The Treaty contained specific obligations for their cultural and religious rights. These have been largely respected, in contrast to measures taken by successive Turkish governments against the Greek minority in Turkey (like forced labor battalions, the Istanbul pogrom and Varlik Vergisi), a minority that is nearly eliminated today (from 70,000 in 1923 to 3,000 in 2000).\n\nIn 1990 a new electoral law was enacted in Greece, which set a threshold of at least 3% of the nationwide vote for a party to be represented in the parliament. Consequently, independent Turkish MPs were barred from election at the 1993 elections. Since then the Turkish minority in the Hellenic Parliament has been represented by Turkish deputies belonging to nationwide political parties, and the Party of Friendship, Equality and Peace, which succeeded the Independent Muslim List in 1991, practically disappeared from the electoral scene. \nThere are presently two Turkish MPs from the Western Thrace portion of East Macedonia and Thrace, both of whom are affiliated to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement: Tsetin Mantatzi (Xanthi) and Achmet Chatziosman (Rhodope), former president (1999–2007) of the Party of Friendship, Equality and Peace created by former (1989) MP Sadik Achmet in 1991.\n\nAt least 14 candidates from the Turkish minority have been nominated, mainly in Rhodope and Xanthi.\n\nFor New Democracy, former MP (2004–2007) Ilchan Achmet and Achmet Achmet are candidates in Rhodope, and in Xanthi Aisel Zeimpek and Achmet Mpountour. Zeimpek had lost her Greek citizenship under Article 19 of the Greek Citizenship Code, which allowed of its revocation for non-ethnic Greeks who left the country. After a lengthy legal battle, she finally won her case with a second appeal before the European Court of Human Rights and re-secured her Greek citizenship in 2001.\n\nFor PASOK, Tsetin Mantatzi and Seval Osmanoglou are among the 5 candidates in Xanthi, Rintvan Kotzamoumin and Achmet Chatziosman among the 5 in Rhodope.\n\nFor the KKE (which presently has no MP in Xanthi or Rhodope), Faik Faik in Rhodope and Chasan Efendi in Xanthi.\n\nFor SYRIZA (which presently has no MP in Xanthi or Rhodope), Chasan Malkots and Chousein Zeimpek are candidates in Xanthi, and in Rhodope Dr. Moustafa Moustafa (former MP) and Tzelalentin Giourtsou.\n\nAccording to the former Article 19 of the 1955 Citizenship Law (No. 3370), a person of non-Greek ethnic origin leaving Greece without the intention of returning may be declared as having lost Greek nationality. According to the Greek government, between 1955 and 1998, approximately 60,000 Greek Muslim individuals, predominantly Turkish, were deprived of their citizenship under Article 19. Of these 60,000, approximately 7,182 lost their citizenship between 1981 and 1997. The application of this law to the Turks of Western Thrace was a retaliatory measure in response to the devastating state-sponsored pogrom which targeted the Greeks of Istanbul in September 1955. The pogrom precipitated an exodus of ethnic Greeks from Turkey. Article 19 was repealed in 1998, though not retroactively.\n\nSince the Treaty of Lausanne used the criterion of religion to refer to the ethnic communities, the Greek Government has usually insisted that the basis of identification of a minority is religious and not ethnic (or national). Thus Greek officials refer to the Muslim minority in Greece as Greek Muslims, who were based mainly in Western Thrace. Muslim communities also lived in Greek Macedonia, Epirus, and Crete (see Cretan Turks) and were the descendants of Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam who joined the Turkish Millet (Ottoman Empire). However, these particular communities were relocated from Greece to Turkey following the Population exchange signed between the two countries in 1922-23, with only the Greek Muslims of Western Thrace exempted from it.\n\nSuccessive Greek Government policies refused to acknowledge the existence of an ethnic Turkish community in Northern Greece, and insisted on referring to Western Thrace Turks as Greek Muslims, suggesting that they were not of ethnic Turkish origin but were the descendants of Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam like the Vallahades and other Greek Muslims of Greek Macedonia. This policy was introduced immediately after the unilateral declaration of independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983 on lands that once had an 82% Greek majority before becoming refugees during the Turkish invasion in 1974. The Greek government declared that it was a measure to avert the possibility of the Greek region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace becoming a \"second Cyprus\" sometime in the future or of being ceded to Turkey on the basis of the ethnic origin of its Muslim inhabitants.\n\nGreek courts have also outlawed the use of the word 'Turkish' to describe the Turkish community. In 1988, the Greek Supreme Court affirmed a 1986 decision of the Court of Appeals of Thrace in which the \"Union of Turkish Associations of Western Thrace\" was ordered closed. The court held that the use of the word 'Turkish' referred to citizens of Turkey, and could not be used to describe citizens of Greece; the use of the word 'Turkish' to describe Greek Muslims was held to endanger public order. This led to about 10,000 people demonstrating against the decision in Western Thrace. According to members of the Turkish minority, it was the first time ethnic Turks had taken to the streets.\n\nMore than 10 newspapers are issued in the Turkish language. According to some sources, newspapers, magazines and books published in Turkey are not allowed entry into Western Thrace, and Turkish television and radio stations are sometimes jammed. According to other sources, the minority has full and independent access to its own newspapers radio, television, and other written media coming from Turkey, regardless of their content.\n\nAccording to the Lausanne Treaty, the Turkish minority is entitled to freedom of religion and to the right to control charitable and religious institutions. However, the Turkish community believes that these international law guarantees have been violated by the Greek government by denying permission to repair or rebuild old mosques or to build new mosques, by denying the right to choose the muftis (this chief religious officers), and by efforts to control the Turkish communities charitable foundations. According to another source, \nmore than 5 new mosques are being built in the prefecture of Xanthi alone and 19 new mosques are being built in the prefecture of Rhodope alone, while in the same prefecture the number of mosques exceeds 160.\n\nAccording to a report by a local organization there have been frequent (six in 2010 and three in the first months of 2011) attacks against the private and public property of Turks in Western Thrace. Among the recent incidents are three in 2010 (in Kahveci, Kırmahalle, Popos and Ifestos at Komotini) where attackers desecrated Turkish cemeteries and broke tombstones. There were also attacks against mosques, Turkish associations and Turkish consulates, attackers used methods like throwing stones, molotov bombs and damaging buildings.\n\nBetween 300,000 and 400,000 Turks have left Western Thrace since 1923; most of them immigrated to Turkey. Western Thrace Turks have also immigrated to Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Austria and Italy. Thus, overall there are an estimated 1 million Turks whose roots are from Western Thrace.\n\nIt is estimated that there are between 25,000 and 40,000 Western Thrace Turks living in Western Europe.\n\nThere are some members of the Greek Muslim community among the some 350,000 Greeks living in Germany who are Turks or who espouse a Turkish identity. The majority of Turks immigrated from Western Thrace. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Thracian tobacco industry was affected by a severe crisis and many tobacco growers lost their income. This resulted in many Turks leaving their homes and immigrating to Germany with estimates suggesting that today there are now between 12,000 and 25,000 residing in Germany.\n\nA minority of Western Thrace Turks can be found in the Netherlands, especially in the Randstad region; after Germany, the Netherlands is the most popular destination for Turkish immigrants.\n\nThere are an estimated 600-700 Western Thrace Turks living in London although this does not include those who are British-born. The total number living outside London is unknown. However even their small number, Western Thrace Turks in the UK have their own community (Association of Western Thrace Turks UK)\n\n\n\n\n"}

Roux claimed to be the reincarnation of Christ and was thus named the \"Christ of Montfavet\", a village on the commune of Avignon where he lived then.\n\nHe wrote three books containing the doctrines of the religious group, including the rejection of several dogmas commonly accepted by the main churches (Jesus' divinity and resurrection, Devil's existence and accuracy of the Gospels, among other things). Vegetarian diet, high degree of proselytism and miraculous healings were the main practices of the organization. The group grew quickly in France and some other countries, counting several thousands of faithful, but memberships are currently on the decline.\n\nAfter Roux's death in 1981, the Universal Christian Church was replaced by the Universal Alliance, a cultural association founded in August 1983 and led by one of Roux's daughter. In the 1950s, the religious group was the subject of criticisms in the media when some faithful and their children died after having refused medical treatments, and was classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary report established by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France.\n\nBorn on 14 June 1903 in Cavaillon from an unbeliever father and a Catholic mother, George Ernest Roux quickly abandoned the faith after reading Plato's works, and became factor in 1920. In the late 1920s, he went to Paris to try an artistic career, and composed, among other things, a poem (\"Le Cercle d'airain\"), a novel (\"Le toit de paille\"), and a one-act play (\"Le Bienheureux\"). On 12 April 1928, he married Jane Robert, and they had together six children raised in Catholicism. Then he founded a symphony orchestra and composed an opera (\"L'Auréole\") in 1939, but the beginning of the World War II forced him to resume service as inspector at the post office in Avignon, where it stayed until December 1953. His meticulous work earned him being appointed assistant inspector sorting of letters. In 1947, he said to have a gift of healing and began to miraculously heal thousands of patients in his detached house named \"La Préfète\" in Montfavet, bought in 1933 by his mother. He published three spirituality-related books which explained his doctrine. In 1947, then in 1950, he revealed to his family that he was the incarnation of Jesus Christ, then made it publicly known in February 1954. On 15 August 1973, Roux even claimed to be God. He died on 26 December 1981.\n\nIn the early 1950s, some followers of Roux created the Christian Agency of Information (Agence Chrétienne d'Information, ACI) in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, 18 rue d'Enghien. From 1953, they published two monthly leaflets: \"Lumière\" and \"Le Témoin de la vie\".\n\nOn 24 December 1952, Roux, then known as the Christ of Montfavet or Georges-Christ, founded the Universal Christian Church whose faithful were widely named the Christ's Witnesses. There was no hierarchical structure: the local groups were informal and autonomous, but the most important ones (in Avignon, Paris, Strasbourg, Toulon) formed associations for organizational purposes. Roux's daughters Genevieve and Jacqueline, Jacqueline's husband René Van Gerding, and René's sister Eva participated in the development of the church, while Roux lived cloistered in his property in Montfavet.\n\nOn 15 June 1983, the Universal Alliance officially replaced the Universal Christian Church. Its statutes, filed at the Prefecture of Avignon, were modified in 2004. With about 500 subscribers, this cultural association aims to air and translate Roux's writings and to organize conferences by Jacqueline Roux.\n\nSociologist Régis Dericquebourg defined the Christian Agency of Information as a \"movement\", the Universal Christian Church as an \"ecclesia\" and the Universal Alliance as a \"circle\". He considered the Universal Alliance a \"network of thought and spirituality circles\", which perpetuates Roux's teachings and has a Quaker and charismatic-related spirituality.\n\nThe doctrines are contained in three books written by Roux: \"Journal d'un guérisseur\" (1950), \"Paroles du guérisseur\" (1950) and \"Mission divine\" (1951), and explained in the monthly magazine \"Messidor\", published from 1951 to 1977. Roux presented himself as a persecuted prophet, said to be Christ and to carry out the law of love unfulfilled by God's representatives including Jesus. He wrote a strong criticism of Christian churches deemed as apostate, asked in a letter Pope Pius XII to officially recognize his reincarnation and sent open letters to priests, occultists and theosophists. Roux denied the existence of the Devil, original sin, Jesus' virgin birth and resurrection, and the truthfulness of the Gospels. He taught that everyone could be a healer with prayer and blessing if he had faith in him. Roux announced the Last Judgment for 1 January 1980 at the latest and said that the Universal Alliance would have to spread across the world. In 1953, some disasters, including outs levees in the Netherlands and earthquakes in the Greek islands, were used by the religion as proof of the proximity of the Apocalypse. According to \"Le Monde\", followers said in 1954 to believe in flying saucers.\n\nAccording to Régis Dericquebourg, this movement presents a new version of Christianity: there is no syncretism, but it is strongly tinged with Gnosticism and can be described as a \"Christic esotericism\". The founder was successively a mystagogue, then a prophet, and the group was first based on a personal and prophetic charisma, then a sacramental charism, then a group charism. The group defines itself as \"christian\", then \"christic\", also developed environmentalism and the \"idea of a symbiosis between man and nature as the foundation of health and spiritual improvement\".\n\nIn the Universal Christian Church, religious ceremonies began with a modified version of \"Our Father\" and ended with a meal together. The crucifix was not used. There were five sacraments: baptism, marriage, confirmation-communion, communion of mind in meetings, and funeral. The religious group proposed, but did not required, a vegetarian diet excluding cannings, potatoes, sugar, salt, alcohol, tobacco and tea. The faithful actively participated in proselytism by distribution of leaflets and door-to-door, and there was sometimes stands in some fairs of major cities and parades of sandwich boards in Paris. Several members, including veteran Jean Thos in Paris, were candidates for legislative elections of 2 January 1956; in its political program, the religious movement said wanting to follow God's will and pointed social issues as homeless, armament, exploitation of workers by employers. It obtained about 10,000 votes in six departments.\n\nIn the Universal Alliance, there is no sacrament. The meetings, now called \"communion of the flesh\", are composed of spontaneous dialogues under divine inspiration. Evangelism is no longer required and children attend the public school.\n\nMembership of the Universal Christian Church reached a peak of 5,000 between 1955 and 1960, in about fifty local groups (Marseille, Nantes, Paris, Strasbourg, Toulon, etc.). Members seem primarily urban, from middle class (teachers, employees...), and Catholic disillusioned by traditional religions. However, membership gradually decreased in subsequent years mainly because of Roux's death and various incidents in the late 1950s which reflected some difficult relationships with the society (child deaths, negative statements in the press, destruction of premises belonging to the group...). in the 2000, they are about 3,000 members of the Universal Alliance worldwide spread in francophone countries, Germany, Italy, U.S. and some countries in Africa, and shared out into fifty communities, and about 1,000 in France. Groups are mainly located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region and the Aude department. In the 1990s, Belgian press reported presence of followers and conferences by Jacqueline Roux in the country.\n\nIn the 1950s, refusals of medical treatments led to the death of several children, including a 13-year boy in October 1953, a young girl in March 1954, and a three-month baby in September 1954. These cases were the subject of a strong coverage in the press, particularly in \"Paris-Match\". For their part, the church's leaders often tried, in news conferences, to justify these deaths, presenting them as \"rewards offered to Christ\". Deaths of adults were also mentioned in media (e.g. Willy Baruch in March 1954, Raymond Joutard in July 1954). However, Roux was never sued for unauthorized practice of medicine.\n\nIn 1995, the Universal Alliance was included in the list of cults of the report by the French parliamentary commission. In 1996, Jacqueline Roux wrote to Alain Gest, a member of the commission, to question this classification, highlighting financial transparency, democratic nature and compliance with the law of her association.\n\nBecause of its particular doctrinal views, the religious group is criticized by main Christian churches, including evangelical associations.\n\n"}
