Her mother was of Manx descent. Adela attended the all-woman Studley Horticultural College in Warwickshire, and Manchester High School for Girls. \n\nAs a teenager, Adela became involved in the militant Women's Social and Political Union founded by her mother and sisters. In November 1909 she joined a protest that disturbed a talk by Winston Churchill at his constituency in Dundee. She was arrested along with Helen Archdale and Maud Joachim. Adela had slapped a policeman who was trying to evict her from the building.\n\nEagle House near Bath in Somerset had became an important refuge for suffragettes who had been released from prison. Mary Blathwayt's parents planted trees there between April 1909 and July 1911 to commemorate the achievements of suffragettes including Adela's mother and sister, Christabel as well as Annie Kenney, Charlotte Despard, Millicent Fawcett and Lady Lytton.\nThe trees were known as \"Annie's Arboreatum\" after Annie Kenney. There was also a \"Pankhurst Pond\" within the grounds. \n\nAdela was invited to Eagle House in 1909 and 1910. She planted a Himalayan Cedar on 3 July 1910. A plaque was made and her photograph was recorded again by Colonel Linley Blathwayt.\n\nHer mother's favourite was Christabel and the two of them took the Women's Social and Political Union as their own organisation. They fell out with many of their leading volunteers and supporters and this included Sylvia Pankhurst and Adela. Both of them believed in socialism whereas Emmeline and Chistabel were pushing for the vote for middle class women. Sylvia was ejected from the party and she set up her own splinter group in East London. Christabel is reported to have said to Sylvia \"“I would not care if you were multiplied by a hundred, but one of Adela is too many.” Adela was given £20, a ticket to Australia and a letter introducing her to Vida Goldstein.\n\nFollowing estrangement from her family, Adela emigrated to Australia in 1914. (Her sister Sylvia created a new life for herself in Ethiopia after the Second World War.) Adela's experience of activism enabled her to be recruited during World War I as an organiser for the Women's Peace Army in Melbourne by Vida Goldstein. Pankhurst wrote a book called \"Put Up the Sword\", penned a number of anti-war pamphlets and addressed public meetings on her opposition to the war and conscription. In August 1917, Pankhurst was arrested during a march against rising food prices in Melbourne, which had been part of a series of sometimes violent demonstrations, unusual for the time in that they were spearheaded by women. In September 1917, she married Tom Walsh of the Federated Seamen's Union of Australasia, with whom she had a son and five daughters. In 1920, Pankhurst became a founding member of the Communist Party of Australia, from which she was later expelled.\n\nShe became disillusioned with communism and founded the anti-communist Australian Women's Guild of Empire in 1927. In 1941 Pankhurst became one of the founding members of the right wing and nationalistic Australia First Movement. She visited Japan in 1939, and was arrested and interned in 1942 for her advocacy of peace with Japan.\n\nHer name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

Speidel however arrived at the King's residence at Schloss Wildenwart, near Rosenheim, after Ludwig had already left for Austria.\n\nLudwig III decided to leave Bavaria temporarily for Austria, and, following an invitation of Ernst Graf von Moy, decided to take up residence at Anif Palace, near Salzburg. There, he ordered Otto Ritter von Dandl, the last prime minister of the Kingdom of Bavaria, to issue a declaration. Dandl demanded an abdication but the King was only willing to issue a statement absolving all officers, soldiers and government officials of the Kingdom of their oath. With this, the Anif declaration, Dandl returned to the Bavarian capital, Munich.\n\nThe original document of the declaration has been lost. It was in the possession of the then interior minister of Bavaria, Erhard Auer, but was lost during the Hitler Putsch in 1923. Only typed copies exist now, bearing handwritten additions by Kurt Eisner.\nDandl returned to Munich the same day and the government under Eisner published the declaration as the abdication of Ludwig III. While some, even conservative politicians, shared the government's interpretation of the declaration as an abdication, others pointed out the discrepancy between its wording and its use by the government as a declaration of abdication.\n\nKurt Eisner had the declaration published word by word with his own below it. In his addition he states that the \"People's State of Bavaria\" () accepts the abdication of King Ludwig III and assures him and his family that they are free to return to Bavaria, like every other citizen, providing they take no steps against the people's state.\n\nAfter the death of Ludwig III in 1921, his son, Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, asserted his rights to the Bavarian crown, claiming it to be his birthright to be King of Bavaria unless the people decided on a different form of government after free elections. Until his death in 1955, Rupprecht continued to demand that the question of whether Bavaria would be a republic or a monarchy should be decided by a constituent assembly chosen in a democratic election.\n\n"}

For a short period at the end of the 1880s, the government went so far as to subsidize immigrant boat passages. It is estimated that the country received over seven million immigrants, predominantly from Spain and Italy, between 1870 and 1930. \n\nArgentina proved attractive to many foreigners confronted with harsh economic conditions in Europe, they were drawn by the appeal of the New World and an underpopulated country rich in natural resources and employment prospects ranging from agriculture to factory work that made the country an immigrant destination. Since then, argentine emigration is low compared to other Latin American countries something that is similar to brazilian emigration situation.\n\nArgentina is a multiethnic society, which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic backgrounds. Argentina is, along with other areas of new settlement like the United States, Canada, Australia, or Brazil, a melting pot of different peoples.\n\nIn the mid-19th century a large wave of immigration started to arrive in Argentina due to new Constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. Eventually Argentina became the second country that received the most immigrants in the world, only second to the United States.\n\nTherefore, most Argentines are of European descent, and are either descendants of colonial-era settlers and/or of the 19th and 20th century immigrants from Europe, with about 86% of the population being of ethnic European descent.\n\nThe most common ethnic groups are Italian and Spanish (including Galicians and Basques). It is estimated that up to 25 million Argentines, up to 60% of the total population, have Italian ancestry, wholly or in part. There are also Germanic, Slavic, British and French populations. Smaller Jewish, Native, Arab, Asian, Gypsy and African communities contribute to the melting pot.\n\nRecent decades immigration includes mainly Paraguayans, Bolivians and Peruvians, among other Latin Americans, Eastern Europeans, Africans and Asians.\n\nAfter the economic recovery that occurred between 2003 and 2011, the 2010 census showed that the country once again became a country of immigration with an increase in total numbers and in percentage of resident foreigners. It is estimated that in 2018 there are more than 2 million immigrants residing in the country, from 1.8 million registered in 2010. It is the country of Latin America with the highest number of total immigrants and the second with the highest percentage of immigrants over the total number of immigrants population.\n\nAccording to the , Argentina had a population of 40,091,359 inhabitants, of which 1,805,957 or 4.6%, were born abroad. The country has long had one of Latin America's lowest growth rates, estimated in 2008 to be 0.917% annually, with a birth rate of 16.32 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.54 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. It also enjoys a comparatively low infant mortality rate. Strikingly, though, its fertility rate is still nearly twice as high (2.3 children per woman) as that in Spain or Italy, despite comparable religiosity figures. The median age is approximately 30 years and life expectancy at birth is 76 years.\n\nMost Argentines outside Argentina are people who have migrated from the middle and upper middle classes. According to official estimates there are 600,000 worldwide Argentine, according to estimates by the International Organization for Migration are about 806,369 since 2001. It is estimated that their descendants would be around 1,900,000. The first wave of emigration occurred during the military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, with principally to Spain, USA, Mexico and Venezuela. During the 1990s, due to the abolition of visas between Argentina and the United States, thousands of Argentines emigrated to the North American country. The last major wave of emigration occurred during the 2001 crisis, mainly to Europe, especially Spain, although there was also an increase in emigration to neighboring countries, particularly Brazil, Chile and Paraguay.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1452644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1452644", "title": "Bhutia", "text": "Bhutia\n\nThe Bhutia བོད་རིགས ( ; ; \"inhabitants of Sikkim\"; in Bhutan: \"Dukpa\") are a community of people of Tibetan ancestry, who speak Lhopo or Sikkimese, a Tibetan dialect fairly mutually intelligible with standard Tibetan. In 2001, the Bhutia numbered around 70,300. Bhutia here refers to Sikkimese of Tibetan ancestry; in contrast, the Bhotiya are a larger family of related Tibetan peoples in northeastern Nepal of which the Bhutia are one member group.\n\nThe language spoken by the Bhutias in Sikkim is Sikkimese, which is 85% mutually intelligible with Tibetan and Dzongkha, the language of Bhutan. Most Bhutias practice the Nyingma school, followed by the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Bhutias are spread out over Nepal, Bhutan, and in northern West Bengal, especially in the towns of Kalimpong and Darjeeling.\n\nThe ancestors of the Bhutia migrated from Tibet to north eastern Nepal, Sikkim, Darjeeling, Kalimpong, and other parts of modern-day Nepal, India and Bhutan. They migrated through the different passes (\"La\" in Tibetan means \"hill\") in the Himalayas. Geographical indications in the name of Bhutias' last names are common. In Northern Sikkim, for example, where the Bhutias are the majority inhabitants, they are known as the Lachenpas or Lachungpas, meaning inhabitants of Lachen (; \"big pass\") or Lachung (; \"small pass\") respectively.\n\nBhutia aristocrats were called \"Kazis\" after similar landlord titles in neighboring regions, especially in modern-day Bangladesh. This feudal system was an integral part of the Chogyal monarchy prior to 1975, when Sikkim was an independent monarchy; the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of Sikkim before the mid-1970s plebiscite was the Bhutia Namgyal dynasty. Among the Bhutias, the Lachenpas and Lachungpas have their own traditional legal system called the \"Dzumsa\" which means \"the meeting place of the people\". The Dzumsa is headed by the village headman known as the \"Pipon\". People of North Sikkim have been given full protection by the state government by deeming a status of Panchayat ward and the Pipon, a status of Panchayat head.\n\nThe traditional outfit of Bhutias is the \"bakhu\" (similar to the Tibetan chuba, but sleeveless), which is a loose cloak type garment fastened at the neck on one side and near the waist with a silk/cotton belt. Male members array the bakhu with loose trousers. Womenfolk wear the bakhu with a silken full sleeve blouse called a \"honju\"; a loose gown type garment fastened tight near the waist with a belt. In the front portion, a loose sheet of multicolored woolen cloth with exotic geometric designs is tied. This is called the \"pangden\" and is a symbol of a married woman. This traditional outfit is complemented by embroidered leather boots worn by both men and women.\n\nBhutia women enjoy a much higher status than their counterparts from other communities. Both women and men have a weakness for gold in its purest form and, traditional jewelry is mostly made of 24 carat (100%) gold.\n\nIn Sikkim, the Bhutias are mostly employed in the government sector, in agriculture, and increasingly in the business arena as well. In the district of Darjeeling, Bhutias are often employed in government and commerce. Bhutias practise intermarriage within their clans and follow a very hierarchical system of bride and groom selection. Clan discrimination is widespread, and marriage outside the community is looked down upon.\n\nThe Bhutias are followers of Vajrayana Buddhism, mainly the Nyingma and Kagyu schools. The main festivals observed by them are Losar and Losoong. The first week of February is usually the time of Losar as it marks the start of the Tibetan New Year. Fire dances are common in the evenings during Losar. Losoong is usually celebrated as the end of the Tibetan year and falls at the end of the tenth Tibetan lunar month (usually December). It is the most important festival among the Bhutias in India, and is marked by the traditional Chaan dancing and merry-making. Losoong is celebrated across the monasteries in Bhutan, Nepal and India. In Sikkim, during the festival of Losoong, often dance forms depict narrativized tales from the life of Padmasambhava or Guru Ugyen.\n\nMonasteries of the Bhutias dot various places in India, most notably the Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim and the Bhutia Busty Monastery or Karma Dorjee Chyoling Monastery, which is also the oldest Monastery in Darjeeling.\n\nBhutia is also the surname of Marwari people of Brahmin caste. They worship deity Ramdev Pir, Khatushyam & Salasar Balaji as Ishta-deva.\n\nA traditional Bhutia house is called a \"khim\" and is usually rectangular.\n\nThe Bhutias have a stone structure outside the house which is used for burning incense. It is called \"sangbum.\" \"Sang\" means incense and \"bum\" means vase; the shape of the structure is like a vase. It is used for burning sang, a sacred offering to the deities. The deities are offered scented dried leaves/stalks of rhododendron anthopogon, juniperus recurva, rhododendron setosum or incense sticks made of pine.\n\nBhutia people traditionally eat rice with animal-fat-fried vegetables or meat, usually pork or beef, and occasionally mutton or chicken. Other well-known foods are momo, steamed meat dumplings, and the \"thukpa\", noodles in broth. The Losar and Loosong are two among many festivals celebrated by the Bhutia community. Almost all Bhutia festivals and holidays hold Buddhist religious significance. They are also known to utilize over 70 species of animal, fungi, and plant. Chhaang is the favourite drink of the Bhutias, and increasingly of other communities coexisting with the Bhutias. It is made of fermented barley or millet, and served in a bamboo container called the \"Tongba\". Tea with milk and sugar, and butter tea, are also served on religious or social occasions.\n\nWithin the Dominion of India, the Bhutias as recognized as Scheduled Tribes in the states of Sikkim, West Bengal and Tripura.\n\nOn August 26, 2015, during her visit to Darjeeling, the Mamata Banerjee led West Bengal Government, announced the formation of a separate development board for the Bhutia community.\n\n\n"}

Just like most tribes in Sulawesi, the Butonese people are also seafarers and traders. The Butonese people have long since migrated to all corners of the Malay archipelago using smaller vessels ranging from those that can only accommodate five people to large boats that can hold up to about 150 tons of goods. In general, the Butonese is a community that inhabits the region of the Buton Sultanate. When the \"swapraja\" (self-governance, created by the Dutch colonial government) domain was abolished, so did the Buton Sultanate also ended in 1951.

According to Amnesty International, over 50,000 children in the Philippines have been arrested and detained since 1995. Torture, rape and other forms of cruel and inhumane treatment are a part of everyday life for those children while they're incarcerated. Most are charged with minor crimes, such as petty theft, sniffing solvents and vagrancy.\n\nBy 2001, jailed children in the Philippines was attracting international media attention. The Australian government-owned television network, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ran a documentary on the issue in which it stated that children as young as eight are being held in adult prisons in the Philippines in contravention of international statutes and the country’s own laws.\n\nIn September 2005, it was estimated that over 4,000 children were in jails and detention centers all over the country — many of them mixed with adults.\n\nAnother estimate states there are an estimated 20,000 children in prison in the Philippines throughout a single year.\n\nBy May 6, 2005, it was estimated there were 2,100 children in jails across the Philippines, 20 of them on death row.\n\nGetting information on children in jail is difficult. \"No one knows what goes on inside of prisons because no one is allowed in,\" Father Cullen said during an interview with the \"Western Catholic Reporter\", the official newspaper of the Archdiocese of Edmonton.\n\nUNICEF is a member of the Juvenile Justice Network-Philippines (JJNP), a broad coalition of government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) responsible for groundwork on the landmark child protection law. Since the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Law (Republic Act 9344) was enacted in 2006, there has been improvements, and some children are referred to welfare homes bypassing the jail.\n\nJailing of children in the Philippines is routine despite the fact that is forbidden by Philippine laws such as the Special Child Protection Act (RA 7610 Article VI[10][a]), the Presidential Decree 603 and RA 9344. The abusive practice, detrimental and dangerous to the child, is forbidden by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 10[2][b]) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (Article 37[c]).\n\nAmnesty International stated that Filipino children who come into conflict with the law are often from marginalized groups including street youth, drug users, and those with interrupted education, who have limited access to the family and societal structures meant to protect them. These children straddle the child and adult worlds and, in some ways, get the worst of each. Even before arrest, children who come into conflict with the law tend to represent the most disadvantaged and marginalized sectors of society. Many are fleeing difficult home situations, often exacerbated by abuse and poverty and resulting in an interrupted education.\n\nChildren are often jailed for things such as playing cards on a sidewalk and held there until their family can pay off a bribe to corrupt police.\nIn response to widespread criticism of the government's often violent and harmful clean-up exercises, government officials in Metro Manila committed to a new initiative of 'rescuing' abused, neglected and exploited street children, placing them in shelters where they were said to be provided with food, medical care, education and protection. However, a 2009 report jointly published by Bahay Tuluyan and UNICEF reported that most ‘rescued’ street children comment that not only were they taken involuntarily and with violence, the conditions in the shelters to which they are taken are extremely poor.\n\nA number of charities are active in helping children in jail in the Philippines.\n\nPreda Foundation visits the jails on a regular basis and hands out food and medicines.\n\nJubilee have been active in gathering evidence and gave testimony to the Congressional Human Rights Caucus on the subject of children in prison in the Philippines.\n\nKids Go Free was formed to advocate for children in conflict with the law. Based on research in the Philippines the group is concerned with the situation of children in jail worldwide. The website aims to raise awareness of this global problem and includes a forum.\n\nChildren in Angeles Jail are detained in a small (3 meters by 7 meters approx) unventilated concrete cell. There is no window in the cell, and the minors have no access to an electric fan (which many of the adult cells have and which is necessary in the constant oppressive heat). The children's cell is in a block containing over 100 convicted adult prisoners. The same cell is always used to house children regardless of the number in the jail. Reports from adult inmates indicate that the same cell was used for up to 15 children at a time. There is no bedding or basic sanitary items supplied by the jail. There is a separated concrete cubicle in the corner of the cell with a toilet. The children are not given any change of clothes and commonly wear rags. There have been reports of a hepatitis and TB epidemic in the jail. The children have a maximum one-hour a day of exercise. They have to request this each day. Children report being underfed and hungry. There is little effort made to rehabilitate the children who report visits from a social worker on average less than once a month. \n\nConditions in the jail may amount to torture, inhuman, degrading treatment of the children. Children are often sexually abused by adult inmates or prison authorities and are sold as prostitutes.

This work offers further information about the history of fashion and luxury goods market in different part of the continent focusing more on Chinese market. We can get closer to this field of social aspect highlighting Chinese middle class luxury shopping behaviour and gain more information from the field of luxuries.\n\nThe term luxury comes from the Latin ´luxuria´, which means the ´extras of life´. The concept of luxury goods refers to have expensive, exclusive goods. Those goods often enjoy high brand perceived quality, and are characterised by high price, superb quality, aesthetic design, heritage, reputation, exclusivity, desirability, personality. Luxuries are objects that provide positional status in society.\n\nThe modern luxury fashion industry originated in France when Charles Frederick Worth arrived in Paris and invented haute couture. The emerging clothing identity was pivotal for the development of luxury goods in the 19c.The success of an haute couture house depended on the talent of a designer who owned the house and who produced made-to-order clothes for aristocracy and upper class. The social groups wanted to reflect wealth and social status. In the 19th century the industrialization of Europe gave rise to luxury brands, many of which are still existing today, such as Louis Vuitton (1854). From the late 1960s, Italian and American luxury fashion companies entered in the market providing ready-to-wear clothes instead of traditional made-to-order ones which replaced in many ways the function of haute couture houses. \nNowadays the purchase and the use of luxury goods has a big role to exhibit personal and social identity through independent style rather than single brands. Consumers are more au demanding, heterogeneous and sophisticated. On global scale, they increase choices in luxury products, shopping channels, and price levels.\n\nLuxury goods companies are trying to improve their competitiveness with expanding their market geographically. They are oriented towards markets such as China, which currently is the biggest market for luxury and prestige brands from the Western industries. The number of Chinese consumers who can afford luxury goods is about 1.3billion (2012). Chinese consumers are increasingly brand aware, and they intend to invest in luxury fashion brands.\n\nLuxury goods companies have to cope with the challenge of cultural and purchasing power differences in China. According to Wong and Ahuvia: ´´The Western rationality inherent in most consumer theories needs to be reinterpreted through the eyes of Eastern reality\" (Wong & Ahuvia, 1998, p. 436). \nChina is culturally a collectivist country, and identities are often described as Confucian collectivism which emphases the social relationship and group welfare over individual needs. Chinese consumers are concerned with positional value consumption in their luxury fashion brand purchasing behaviour. They perceive and pursue comprehensive values associated with luxury fashion brands. Chinese consumers put more emphasis on social value brands compared with other countries. They often use material possessions and brand names to reinforce their social identity. Luxury goods are their social tools to increase distance from other social groups and to identify with peers of same social status. However personal cultural orientations can be influenced by age, social class, education and travel. Western luxury goods companies, when entering China, should also take into consideration the Chinese multidimensional cultural orientation (heterogeneity of Chinese consumers).\nWhen cultural meanings of a luxury brand are consistent with one's cultural orientation, the consumer is more likely to form positive beliefs about and attitude towards purchasing the specific brand resulting in higher purchases. Chinese consumers are the most influenced by word-of mouth strategy when buying new goods. According to some research, collectivist consumers are likely to pay more attention to interpersonal effects of purchasing goods whereas individualist are more likely to consider the personal dimension of purchasing luxury goods, and whereas collectivist consumers tend to comply with social pressure, individualist consumers are less affected by the influence of reference groups.\n\nWith a fast growing economy and a massive population, China managed to become the most attractive markets for luxury brands in the world. The growing middle-class group in China is a main engine for luxury businesses. Increased buying power and following the trend of shopping in high quality and branding goods make these people willing to purchase mid to high end luxury products . Due to the lack of knowledge Middle-class consumers in China buy luxury products under the recommendations of experts in the fashion industry. For Chinese people luxuries are still very much a ´fetish´ from ´abroad´. Many people buy luxuries in order to show off, and people consider each other very much on the appearance and just by the first glance . Chinese people seem to purchase luxury goods to good fortune, and apparat to stren the positional value of luxury rather than personal hedonism.\n\nChinese middle-class consumers perceive luxury brands as highly valuable possessions, and they primarily use them as a tool to meet the social expectations of important reference groups . The best-known luxury brands are no good options for consumers who want to express their own uniqueness, probably due to the popularity of the brands.\nChinese middle-class consumers are not perceived as extravagant shoppers but they prefer to buy products that will provide them with a social status. This trend also explains why Chinese consumers constitute a fast-growing market for luxury products at the same time that they save a much higher percentage of their incomes than their counterparts in other countries.\nDue to their culture Value Consciousness and Susceptibility to Normative influence played a crucial role luxury brands and Chinese Middle-class consumers. Those to elements helped Companies to communicate with target consumers and build marketing strategies to position a luxury brand in China. For example, a common positioning strategy used by established luxury brands in China is to place an emphasis on superior product. Due to the lack of knowledge of Chinese consumers this strategy may have worked successfully but companies are trying to focus on the ways in which the brands can help consumers accomplish their social goals. Luxury brands in China need to highlight the social meanings of their products and clearly communicate how their products can benefit consumers in important social situations and connect them with desirable social groups.\n\nChina is set to become the second biggest consumer of luxury goods by 2015.\nHatssmon Y. & Dixit V. (2009), Understanding China's wealthy, McKinsey Q (4):32–3.eavily influenced by fashion advertising and magazines for over two decades, wealthy Chinese consumers are no longer naïve admirers of just any big logos.

The major possible mechanism causing the cold ocean surface temperature anomaly is based on the fact that freshwater decreases ocean water salinity, and through this process prevents colder waters sinking. Observed freshwater increase originates probably from Greenland ice melt.\n\nClimate scientists Michael Mann of Penn State and Stefan Rahmstorf from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research suggested that the observed cold pattern during years of temperature records is a sign that the Atlantic Ocean’s Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) may be weakening. They published their findings, and concluded that the AMOC circulation shows exceptional slowdown in the last century, and that Greenland melt is a possible contributor. Tom Delworth of NOAA suggested that natural variability, which includes different modes, here namely the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation through wind driven ocean temperatures are also a factor. A 2014 study by Jon Robson et al. from the University of Reading concluded about the anomaly, \"...suggest that a substantial change in the AMOC is unfolding now.\" Another study by Didier Swingedouw concluded that the slowdown of AMOC in the 1970s may have been unprecedented over the last millennium.\n\nA study published in 2016, by researchers from the University of South Florida, Canada and the Netherlands, used GRACE satellite data to estimate freshwater flux from Greenland. They concluded that freshwater runoff is accelerating, and could eventually cause a disruption of AMOC in the future, which would affect Europe and North America.\n\nAnother study published in 2016, found further evidence for a considerable impact from sea level rise for the U.S. East Coast. The study confirms earlier research findings which identified the region as a hotspot for rising seas, with a potential to divert 3–4 times higher than the global average sea level rise rate. The researchers attribute the possible increase to an ocean circulation mechanism called deep water formation, which is reduced due to AMOC slow down, leading to more warmer water pockets below the surface. Additional the study noted, \"Our results suggest that higher carbon emission rates also contribute to increased [sea level rise] in this region compared to the global average.\"\n\nIn 2005, British researchers noticed that the net flow of the northern Gulf Stream had decreased by about 30% since 1957. Coincidentally, scientists at Woods Hole had been measuring the freshening of the North Atlantic as Earth becomes warmer. Their findings suggested that precipitation increases in the high northern latitudes, and polar ice melts as a consequence. By flooding the northern seas with lots of extra fresh water, global warming could, in theory, divert the Gulf Stream waters that usually flow northward, past the British Isles and Norway, and cause them to instead circulate toward the equator. If this were to happen, Europe's climate would be seriously impacted.\n\nDon Chambers from the USF College of Marine Science mentioned, \"\"The major effect of a slowing AMOC is expected to be cooler winters and summers around the North Atlantic, and small regional increases in sea level on the North American coast.\" James Hansen and Makiko Sato stated, \"AMOC slowdown that causes cooling ~1°C and perhaps affects weather patterns is very different from an AMOC shutdown that cools the North Atlantic several degrees Celsius; the latter would have dramatic effects on storms and be irreversible on the century time scale.\"\" Downturn of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, has been tied to extreme regional sea level rise.\n\nSince 2004 the RAPID program monitors the ocean circulation.\n\n\n"}

Pages on the site dealt with murder, rape, farm attacks and armed robbery. The stated aim of the site was \"to provide foreigners with detailed information and regular updates regarding the issue of safety in South Africa\". The site was started on 4 July 2006 purportedly by a Neil Watson, later purportedly joined by Shaun Thompson; although newspaper reports later suggested that both of these may have been noms-de-plume of a gay rights activist, Juan Duval Uys.\n\nOn 21 November 2006 the website was suspended due to the failure of the owners to remove what the hosting service deemed to be abusive content. Watson stated that the offending comments were left by hackers as part of a smear campaign to discredit the site, and that the site would be relaunched with a new host by 30 November 2006.\n\nThe site was back online at the url crimexposouthafrica.net, but, as of October 2008, is discontinued.\n\nThe site received much criticism for \"\"highlighting negative news and ignoring successes in the fight against crime\". In particular, criticism came from the tourism sector for \"skewing the truth\", as well as the South African Football Association for \"counteracting job creation by discouraging tourism and investment\"\" (South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup). The Crime Expo site contended that South African tourism agencies were only interested in the money spent by international tourists, not in their safety, and were thus downplaying publicity on the violent crimes committed in the country.\n\nIn response to the Crime Expo website, several individuals started opposing sites claiming to provide a more balanced view of crime in the country. The two most prominent ones are Real South Africa (started by Pieter Boshoff), whose stated aim is to \"\"make a positive contribution to the development of the country by following a positive approach\", and True Crime Expo(created by Malan Jacobs), which was started \"to try and bring some perspective in this debate\".\" Further websites have been developed more recently that enable \"public interactivity in the debate\". Crime Out Loud (created by Claudio Caldeira), displays a more interactive, community-based website for a balanced debate.\n\nBoshoff's website has been endorsed by prominent businessman Raymond Ackerman, which led to a call from Watson for people to boycott Ackerman's Pick 'n Pay supermarket and to send e-mail and text messages to the chain.\n\nThe website, and the intense debate it sparked, received wide press coverage, being syndicated by Reuters both locally and abroad. Major news stations and papers which covered the story include BBC News, Independent Online and The Independent. The impact and content of the site was also debated in several local and international blogs.\n\nOn 14 November 2006 \"The Citizen\" published an investigative report alleging that Watson and Shaun Thompson may be the same person, and that they may also be the same person as Juan Duval Uys. Uys is a gay rights activist and leader of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance. Watson has denied being Uys, stating that Uys was a volunteer at CESA and was involved in its establishment. \"The Citizen\" further reported that although the website had been accepting donations for some time, no Section 21 company (referring to a South African non-profit organisation) had been registered in its name. Simon Grindrod, the Cape Town leader of the Independent Democrats, laid a charge of fraud against Watson, calling on him to \"explain what he has done with the money\".\n\nAccording to the website, the leaders of the organisation were in the process of filing an application at the Independent Electoral Commission in Pretoria to register as a political party. The party would be registered as \"Crime Expo South Africa\", abbreviated CESA. In early November 2006, the IEC reported that a man claiming to be Mr. Watson had enquired about forming a political party, but had not actually begun the process.\n\nIn August 2008, the National Party South Africa party was registered with the Independent Electoral Commission as a new incarnation of the defunct New National Party. Juan-Duval Uys was listed as the party's organiser.\n"}

However, it seems to have substantially assimilated to the Khalkha dialect since it first was described by Sanžeev, and some classificational differences seem to be due to what historical (or even ideal) state got classified. A population of 20,000 was reported in 2000. Speakers live mainly in the west of Lake Khövsgöl in the sums Bayanzürkh, Ulaan-Uul and Rinchinlkhümbe in the Khövsgöl Province of Mongolia.\n\nIn contrast to Oirat, it has and and a diphthongized equivalent of *ai. However, monophthongized reflexes of *ai can be encountered and more so in older language material, so it can be assumed that due to Khalkha influence. Somewhat similar developments can be observed for other vowels, but as at least and can get palatalized, it is problematic whether palatalized consonants or fronted vowels have to be considered as phonemes. It patterns with the Oirat dialects of the Mongolian state in that it retains *ŋn and sometimes has *b > . It doesn't have the Khalkh and in non-first syllables, as these merged with and .\n\nPerson inflections as in Oirat or Buryat are getting lost, but used to be present. There are both voluntatives (irrespective of number) in –ja/-ji as in Khalkha and –su for first person singular as in Oirat and Buryat, e.g. ‘let’s burn it’ and 'I shall enter', but the latter form is rare. The benedictive –kti is actively used as holds for Buryat, e.g. ‘Please, come with us’. Next to the normal concessive in –g/-k ‘s/he may’, there is also a concessive - that marks an order to a third person. The other, fairly unremarkable modal verbal suffixes are the imperative, prescriptive, optative and dubitative. The inventory of indicative finite verbal suffixes contains the usual reflexes of Written Mongolian ⟨-nam⟩, ⟨-luγ-a⟩, ⟨-ǰuqui⟩ and ⟨-ba⟩, the last one being rare as usual. There is a fifth suffix, (possibly from ⟨-ǰu orkiǰuqui⟩), probably expressing some kind of perfect aspect meaning, that is peculiar to Darkhad, e.g. ‘has sent’. The participles are the same as in Common Mongolic. However, a thorough analysis of the function of these items in contrast to each other has not been conducted. The converbs are not very particular, but the earliest texts of Darkhad still have a conditional (as in Buryat and Middle Mongolian) next to . Furthermore, it used to be possible to negative them with reflexes of ⟨ügei⟩ as in Buryat. Instead of ⟨-maγča⟩ ‘as soon as’, ⟨-nsar⟩ is used.\n\nThe case system is the same as in Khalkha, and Oirat plurals like –mud are absent. The pronouns are the same as Khalkha, but a paradigm of the first person plural exclusive without nominative is attested for the old stages of Darkhat (as would hold for Khalkha in the 1930s and still holds for Oirat).\n\n"}
{"id": "29567568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29567568", "title": "Delusions of Gender", "text": "Delusions of Gender\n\nDelusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference is a 2010 book by Cordelia Fine, written to debunk the idea that men and women are hardwired with different interests. The author criticizes claimed evidence of the existence of innate biological differences between men and women's minds as being faulty and exaggerated, and while taking a position of agnosticism with respect to inherent differences relating to interest/skill in 'understanding the world' versus 'understanding people', reviews literature demonstrating how cultural and societal beliefs contribute to sex differences.\n\nIn the first part of the book, \"'Half Changed World', Half Changed Minds\", Fine argues that social and environmental factors strongly influence the mind, challenging a 'biology as fallback' view that, since society is equal now for the sexes, persistent inequalities must be due to biology. She also discusses the history and impact of gender stereotypes and the ways that science has been used to justify sexism.\n\nIn the second part of the book, \"Neurosexism\", Fine criticizes the current available arguments and studies supporting sex differences in the mind, focusing on methodological weaknesses and implicit assumptions. Within neuroscientific investigations, these include small samples that give rise to unreliable, spurious results, and poorly justified 'reverse inferences' (claims of stereotype-consistent psychological differences between the sexes on the basis of brain differences). Fine also demonstrates how already weak neuroscientific conclusions are then grossly overblown by popular writers. Fine also discusses non-neuroimaging evidence cited as support for innate differences between the sexes. For example, she explains weaknesses in the work done by a student of Simon Baron-Cohen that has been widely cited (by the Gurian Institute, by Leonard Sax, by Peter Lawrence, and by Baron-Cohen himself): one-and-a-half-day-old babies were tested for preference in sequence rather than being given a choice; were tested in different viewing positions, some horizontal on their backs and some held in a parent's lap, which could affect their perception; inadequate efforts were made to ensure the sex of the subject was unknown to the tester at the time of the test; the authors assume, without justification, that newborn looking preferences are a reliable 'flag' for later social skills that are the product of a long and complex developmental process.\n\nIn the third part of the book, \"Recycling Gender\", Fine discusses the highly gendered society in which children develop, and the contribution of that to the group identity processes that motivate children to 'self-socialize'. This challenges the common belief of parents that they tried gender-neutral parenting, but it didn't work. An overall thesis of the work is the negative impact for sex equality of neurosexism (popular or academic neuroscientific claims that reinforce or justify gender stereotypes in ways that are not scientifically justified).\n\nIn the UK, the book received positive reviews in \"Nature\", \"The Independent\", \"The Times Literary Supplement\", \"New Scientist\", \"Metro\" and \"The Belfast Telegraph\". \"The Guardian\" and \"London Evening Standard\" each chose it as a Book of the Year. It was Book of the Week in \"Times Higher Education\".\n\nIn Australia, the book received positive reviews in \"The Age\", \"The Australian\" and \"The West Australian\".\n\n\"Delusions of Gender\" received positive reviews in the United States in \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"USA Today\", \"Newsweek\", \"Jezebel\" and \"Kirkus Reviews\". \"Publishers Weekly\" chose it for a starred review and as a Pick of the Week.\n\nMore positive reviews came from \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", \"The Globe and Mail\", \"Socialist Worker\", \"Out in Perth\", \"The Fat Quarter\", \"Erotic Review\", \"The F Word\", \"Counterfire\", \"Neuroskeptic\" (at \"Discover\" magazine). \"Ms.\" magazine and \"Elle\" singled the book out for their readers.\n\n\nSimon Baron-Cohen reviewed the book in \"The Psychologist\". In it, he accused Fine of \"fusing science with politics,\" writing, \"Where I – and I suspect many other contemporary scientists – would part ways with Fine is in her strident, extreme denial of the role that biology might play in giving rise to any sex differences in the mind and brain. ...(she) ignores that you can be a scientist interested in the nature of sex differences while being a clear supporter of equal opportunities and a firm opponent of all forms of discrimination in society.\" Fine responded in a published letter to \"The Psychologist,\" stating \"The thesis of my book (no veils required) is that while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don’t yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"\n\nFormer APA President Diane F. Halpern, co-author of the article \"The Science of Sex Differences in Mathematics and Science\" that Fine criticizes in \"Delusions of Gender,\" reviewed the book and concluded that it was \"strongest in exposing research conclusions that are closer to fiction than science...[but] weakest in failing to also point out differences that are supported by a body of carefully conducted and well-replicated research\", noting that Fine largely ignores the latter body of research.\n\nStanford neurobiologist Ben Barres stated in a review for the Public Library of Science Biology that Delusions of Gender \"should be required reading for every neurobiology student, if not every human being.\"\n\nLewis Wolpert, a developmental biologist who is the author of \"Why can't a woman be more like a man?\", in a video lecture stated that Fine \"[hasn't] got a clue about biology\". However, he offered no specific criticism of Fine's claims.\n\nMcCarthy and Ball (2011) reviewed the book in the journal \"Biology of Sex Differences.\" They acknowledged that \"Prompting laypeople to adopt a more critical view of overly simplistic views of complex data sets is a goal any scientist can support, and for that we applaud (Fine's) efforts.\" However, their overall review is not positive, and they suggest that Fine's book presents an oversimplified and seriously distorted characterization of neuroscience as applied to the study of sex differences. They expressed disappointment that Fine's book \"...can be vexing in the ways the scientific study of sex differences in brain and behavior is portrayed and (how) the current state-of-the-art is presented.\" However, later work by Fine published in the journal \"Neuroethics\" identified systematic issues in the way human neuroimaging investigations of sex differences tend to be investigated, contra the notion of a few 'bad apples'. Many of the criticisms of such work made in \"Delusions of Gender\" were noted in the article \"Perils and pitfalls of reporting sex differences\" by Donna L. Maney, as part of a \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" Theme Issue \"Multifaceted origins of sex differences in the brain', compiled and edited by McCarthy in 2016.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk, reviewing the book with Rebecca Jordan-Young's \"Brain Storm\", in the \"Quarterly Review of Biology\" wrote: \"It is important to emphasize that neither author advocates throwing the gender-neutral baby out with its pink or blue bathwater ... The books are good ammunition for arguments with people who think science has incontrovertibly shown biological bases for gender differences such as mathematical ability. At the same time, they are not simply claiming that “it is all culture” or that science can play no role in understanding gender. Both Fine and Jordan-Young want better science, not less of it.\"\n\n\n"}

Within Eastern Nilotic, Dongotono is considered part of the Lotuko language group, in the Lotuko-Maa branch of Teso-Lotuko-Maa (also referred to as the non-Bari languages). Other members of the Lotuko language group include Lopit, Lotuko, Lokoya and Lango, all spoken in nearby regions of in South Sudan. Of these languages, Lopit is most similar to Dongotono, with a comparative study showing 66.4% lexical similarity between the two. The same study showed 60.6% lexical similarity between Dongotono and Lotuko, and 56.5% similarity between Dongotono and Lokoya.\n\nThe Dongotono language is spoken by the Dongotono people, who live on the north-western slopes of the Dongotono Mountains in the southern part of Eastern Equatoria State, South Sudan. Administratively, this area is part of Ikotos County, and the Dongotono live in large and densely populated settlements which include Chakari, Ikotos, Isoke, and Bira. There are an estimated 5,000 speakers of the language, and the language is considered threatened, though the number of Dongotono people may be as much as 20,000.\n\nThere has been very little research on Dongotono, but some tentative phonological and morphological observations can be found in Vossen (1982), based on wordlist data collected in the 1970s. Vossen notes that the data are too limited to draw any safe conclusions. He observed that the phoneme inventories of Dongotono, Lokoya and Lopit were similar enough to be treated together, and provided a consonant inventory for all three languages together, represented in the table below.\n\nThe voiced palatal stop /ɟ/ is described as implosive (/ʄ/). Vossen also notes that /b/ is interchangeable with implosive [ɓ], and /d/ is interchangeable with implosive [ɗ]. /p/ does not occur word-initially in Vossen's Dongotono data, and is replaced by [f] or [ɸ] between vowels. /pː/ does not seem to be present in Dongotono. /k/ is replaced by [x] in certain environments but is retained in others. There are no examples the voiced velar stop /g/ in Vossen's Dongotono data. The glottal stop /ʔ/ occurs word-finally only. The glides /wː/ and /jː/ are only found word-medially.\n\nAccording to Vossen, Dongotono has two sets of five vowels, distinguished by the phonological feature Advanced Tongue Root ([ATR]). These are listed in the table below.\n\nHowever, Vossen notes that no different symbols were used for [+ATR] /a/ and [-ATR] /a/ \"as they cannot be distinguished phonetically\".\n\nVossen finds no examples of vowel length being contrastive in Dongotono. He observes that vowel harmony plays an important role, but does not describe the process.\n\nVossen observes that on the surface there are four tones in Dongotono: High, Low, Mid, and High-Falling. They appear to be used for both lexical and grammatical contrasts.\n\nWord order in Dongotono is generally Verb-Subject-Object, as is typical for most Eastern Nilotic languages.\n\nVossen states that for all the non-Bari languages, including Dongotono, the verbs fall into two morphological classes, conventionally called Class 1 and Class 2. Class 2 verbs have a stem with an initial close-front vowel /i-/ or /ɪ-/, and Class 1 verb stems are consonant-initial. A number of possible verbal affixes were observed but their functions not determined.\n\nNumber-marking on nouns appears to be extremely irregular.

{"id": "18789453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18789453", "title": "Gothic language", "text": "Gothic language\n\nGothic is an extinct East Germanic language that was spoken by the Goths. It is known primarily from the \"Codex Argenteus\", a 6th-century copy of a 4th-century Bible translation, and is the only East Germanic language with a sizable text corpus. All others, including Burgundian and Vandalic, are known, if at all, only from proper names that survived in historical accounts, and from loanwords in other languages such as Portuguese, Spanish, and French.\n\nAs a Germanic language, Gothic is a part of the Indo-European language family. It is the earliest Germanic language that is attested in any sizable texts, but it lacks any modern descendants. The oldest documents in Gothic date back to the fourth century. The language was in decline by the mid-sixth century, partly because of the military defeat of the Goths at the hands of the Franks, the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation (in Spain the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589). \nThe language survived as a domestic language in the Iberian peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal) as late as the eighth century. Gothic-seeming terms are found in manuscripts subsequent to this date, but these may or may not belong to the same language. In particular, a language known as Crimean Gothic survived in the lower Danube area and in isolated mountain regions in Crimea. Lacking certain sound changes characteristic of Gothic, however, Crimean Gothic cannot be a lineal descendant of Bible Gothic.\n\nThe existence of such early attested texts makes it a language of considerable interest in comparative linguistics.\n\nOnly a few documents in Gothic survive, not enough for completely reconstructing the language. Most Gothic corpora are translations or glosses of other languages (namely, Greek), so foreign linguistic elements most certainly influenced the texts. These are the primary sources:\n\n\n\nReports of the discovery of other parts of Ulfilas' Bible have not been substantiated. Heinrich May in 1968 claimed to have found in England 12 leaves of a palimpsest containing parts of the Gospel of Matthew. \n\nOnly fragments of the Gothic translation of the Bible have been preserved. The translation was apparently done in the Balkans region by people in close contact with Greek Christian culture. The Gothic Bible apparently was used by the Visigoths in Iberia until about 700, and perhaps for a time in Italy, the Balkans, and Ukraine. In exterminating Arianism, many texts in Gothic were probably expunged and overwritten as palimpsests or collected and burned. Apart from Biblical texts, the only substantial Gothic document that still exists and the only lengthy text known to have been composed originally in the Gothic language, is the \"Skeireins\", a few pages of commentary on the Gospel of John.\n\nVery few secondary sources make reference to the Gothic language after about 800. In \"De incrementis ecclesiae Christianae\" (840–842), Walafrid Strabo, a Frankish monk who lived in Swabia, speaks of a group of monks, who reported that \"even now certain peoples in Scythia (Dobruja), especially around Tomis spoke a \"sermo Theotiscus\" ('Germanic language'), the language of the Gothic translation of the Bible, and they used such a liturgy.\n\nIn evaluating medieval texts that mention the Goths, many writers used the word \"Goths\" to mean any Germanic people in eastern Europe (such as the Varangians), many of whom certainly did not use the Gothic language as known from the Gothic Bible. Some writers even referred to Slavic-speaking people as Goths. However, it is clear from Ulfilas' translation that despite some puzzles the language belongs with the Germanic language group, not with Slavic.\n\nThe relationship between the language of the Crimean Goths and Ulfilas's Gothic is less clear. The few fragments of Crimean Gothic from the 16th century show significant differences from the language of the Gothic Bible although some of the glosses, such as \"ada\" for \"egg\", could indicate a common heritage, and Gothic \"mena\" (\"moon\"), compared to Crimean Gothic \"mine\", can suggest an East Germanic connection.\n\nGenerally, the Gothic language refers to the language of Ulfilas, but the attestations themselves are largely from the 6th century, long after Ulfilas had died. The above list is not exhaustive, and a more extensive list is available on the website of the Wulfila project.\n\nUlfilas's Gothic, as well as that of the \"Skeireins\" and various other manuscripts, was written using an alphabet that was most likely invented by Ulfilas himself for his translation. Some scholars (such as Braune) claim that it was derived from the Greek alphabet only while others maintain that there are some Gothic letters of Runic or Latin origin.\n\nA standardized system is used for transliterating Gothic words into the Latin script. The system mirrors the conventions of the native alphabet, such as writing long as \"ei\". The Goths used their equivalents of \"e\" and \"o\" alone only for long higher vowels, using the digraphs \"ai\" and \"au\" (much as in French) for the corresponding short or lower vowels. There are two variant spelling systems: a \"raw\" one that directly transliterates the original Gothic script and a \"normalized\" one that adds diacritics (macrons and acute accents) to certain vowels to clarify the pronunciation or, in certain cases, to indicate the Proto-Germanic origin of the vowel in question. The latter system is usually used in the academic literature.\n\nThe following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for vowels:\n\nNotes:\n\nThe following table shows the correspondence between spelling and sound for consonants:\n\n\nIt is possible to determine more or less exactly how the Gothic of Ulfilas was pronounced, primarily through comparative phonetic reconstruction. Furthermore, because Ulfilas tried to follow the original Greek text as much as possible in his translation, it is known that he used the same writing conventions as those of contemporary Greek. Since the Greek of that period is well documented, it is possible to reconstruct much of Gothic pronunciation from translated texts. In addition, the way in which non-Greek names are transcribed in the Greek Bible and in Ulfilas's Bible is very informative.\n\n\nIn general, Gothic consonants are devoiced at the ends of words. Gothic is rich in fricative consonants (although many of them may have been approximants, it is hard to separate the two) derived by the processes described in Grimm's law and Verner's law and characteristic of Germanic languages. Gothic is unusual among Germanic languages in having a phoneme, which has not become through rhotacization. Furthermore, the doubling of written consonants between vowels suggests that Gothic made distinctions between long and short, or geminated consonants: \"atta\" \"dad\", \"kunnan\" \"to know\" (Dutch \"kennen\", German \"kennen\" \"to know\", Icelandic \"kunna\").\n\n\n\nGothic has three nasal consonants, one of which is an allophone of the others, all found only in complementary distribution with them. Nasals in Gothic, like most other languages, are pronounced at the same point of articulation as either the consonant that follows them (assimilation). Therefore, clusters like and are not possible.\n\nAccentuation in Gothic can be reconstructed through phonetic comparison, Grimm's law and Verner's law. Gothic used a stress accent rather than the pitch accent of Proto-Indo-European. This is indicated by the shortening of long vowels and and the loss of short vowels and in unstressed final syllables.\n\nJust as in other Germanic languages, the free moving Proto-Indo-European accent was replaced with one fixed on the first syllable of simple words. Accents do not shift when words are inflected. In most compound words, the location of the stress depends on the type of compound:\n\n\nFor example, with comparable words from modern Germanic languages:\n\nGothic preserves many archaic Indo-European features that are not always present in modern Germanic languages, in particular the rich Indo-European declension system. Gothic had nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases, as well as vestiges of a vocative case that was sometimes identical to the nominative and sometimes to the accusative. The three genders of Indo-European were all present. Nouns and adjectives were inflected according to one of two grammatical numbers: the singular and the plural.\n\nNouns can be divided into numerous declensions according to the form of the stem: \"a\", \"ō\", \"i\", \"u\", \"an\", \"ōn\", \"ein\", \"r\", etc. Adjectives have two variants, \"indefinite\" and \"definite\" (sometimes \"indeterminate\" and \"determinate\"), with definite adjectives normally used in combination with the definite determiners (such as the definite article \"sa\"/\"þata\"/\"sō\") while indefinite adjectives are used in other circumstances., Indefinite adjectives generally use a combination of \"a\"-stem and \"ō\"-stem endings, and definite adjectives use a combination of \"an\"-stem and \"ōn\"-stem endings. The concept of \"strong\" and \"weak\" declensions that is prevalent in the grammar of many other Germanic languages is less significant in Gothic because of its conservative nature: the so-called \"weak\" declensions (those ending in \"n\") are, in fact, no weaker in Gothic (in terms of having fewer endings) than the \"strong\" declensions (those ending in a vowel), and the \"strong\" declensions do not form a coherent class that can be clearly distinguished from the \"weak\" declensions.\n\nAlthough descriptive adjectives in Gothic (as well as superlatives ending in \"-ist\" and \"-ost\") and the past participle may take both definite and indefinite forms, some adjectival words are restricted to one variant. Some pronouns take only definite forms: for example, \"sama\" (English \"same\"), adjectives like \"unƕeila\" (\"constantly\", from the root \"ƕeila\", \"time\"; compare to the English \"while\"), comparative adjective and present participles. Others, such as \"áins\" (\"some\"), take only the indefinite forms.\n\nThe table below displays the declension of the Gothic adjective \"blind\" (English: \"blind\"), compared with the \"an\"-stem noun \"guma\" \"man\"(human) and the \"a\"-stem noun \"dags\" \"day\":\n\nThis table is, of course, not exhaustive. (There are secondary inflexions of various sorts not described here.) An exhaustive table of only the \"types\" of endings that Gothic took is presented below.\n\n\nGothic adjectives follow noun declensions closely; they take same types of inflexion.\n\nGothic inherited the full set of Indo-European pronouns: personal pronouns (including reflexive pronouns for each of the three grammatical persons), possessive pronouns, both simple and compound demonstratives, relative pronouns, interrogatives and indefinite pronouns. Each follows a particular pattern of inflexion (partially mirroring the noun declension), much like other Indo-European languages. One particularly noteworthy characteristic is the preservation of the dual number, referring to two people or things; the plural was used only for quantities greater than two. Thus, \"the two of us\" and \"we\" for numbers greater than two were expressed as \"wit\" and \"weis\" respectively. While proto-Indo-European used the dual for all grammatical categories that took a number (as did Classical Greek and Sanskrit), most Old Germanic languages are unusual in that they preserved it only for pronouns. Gothic preserves an older system with dual marking on both pronouns and verbs (but not nouns or adjectives).\n\nThe simple demonstrative pronoun \"sa\" (neuter: \"þata\", feminine: \"so\", from the Indo-European root \"*so\", \"*seh\", \"*tod\"; cognate to the Greek article ὁ, ἡ, τό and the Latin \"istud\") can be used as an article, allowing constructions of the type \"definite article + weak adjective + noun\".\n\nThe interrogative pronouns begin with \"ƕ-\", which derives from the proto-Indo-European consonant \"*kʷ\" that was present at the beginning of all interrogratives in proto-Indo-European. That is cognate with the \"wh-\" at the beginning of many English interrogative, which, as in Gothic, are pronounced with in some dialects. The same etymology is present in the interrogatives of many other Indo-European languages\": \"w-\" in German, \"hv-\" in Danish, the Latin \"qu-\" (which persists in modern Romance languages), the Greek τ- or π-, the Slavic and Indic \"k-\" as well as many others.\n\nThe bulk of Gothic verbs follow the type of Indo-European conjugation called 'thematic' because they insert a vowel derived from the reconstructed proto-Indo-European phonemes \"*e\" or \"*o\" between roots and inflexional suffixes. The pattern is also present in Greek and Latin:\n\nThe other conjugation, called 'athematic', in which suffixes are added directly to roots, exists only in unproductive vestigial forms in Gothic, just like in Greek and Latin. The most important such instance is the verb \"to be\", which is athematic in Greek, Latin, Sanskrit and many other Indo-European languages.\n\nGothic verbs are, like nouns and adjectives, divided into strong verbs and weak verbs. Weak verbs are characterised by preterites formed by appending the suffixes \"-da\" or \"-ta\", parallel to past participles formed with \"-þ\" / \"-t\". Strong verbs form preterites by ablaut (the alternating of vowels in their root forms) or by reduplication (prefixing the root with the first consonant in the root plus \"aí\") but without adding a suffix in either case. That parallels the Greek and Sanskrit perfects. The dichotomy is still present in modern Germanic languages:\n\nVerbal conjugation in Gothic have two grammatical voices: the active and the medial; three numbers: singular, dual (except in the third person) and plural; two tenses: present and preterite (derived from a former perfect); three grammatical moods: indicative, subjunctive (from an old optative form) and imperative as well as three kinds of nominal forms: a present infinitive, a present participle, and a past passive. Not all tenses and persons are represented in all moods and voices, as some conjugations use auxiliary forms.\n\nFinally, there are forms called 'preterite-present': the old Indo-European perfect was reinterpreted as present tense. The Gothic word \"wáit\", from the proto-Indo-European \"*woid-he\" (\"to see\" in the perfect), corresponds exactly to its Sanskrit cognate \"véda\" and in Greek to ϝοἶδα. Both etymologically should mean \"I have seen\" (in the perfect sense) but mean \"I know\" (in the preterite-present meaning). Latin follows the same rule with \"nōuī\" (\"I have learned\" and \"I know\"). The preterite-present verbs include \"áigan\" (\"to possess\") and \"kunnan\" (\"to know\") among others.\n\nThe word order of Gothic is fairly free as is typical of other inflected languages. The natural word order of Gothic is assumed to have been like that of the other old Germanic languages; however, nearly all extant Gothic texts are translations of Greek originals and have been heavily influenced by Greek syntax.\n\nSometimes what can be expressed in one word in the original Greek will require a verb and a complement in the Gothic translation; for example, διωχθήσονται (\"diōchthēsontai\", \"they will be persecuted\") is rendered:\nLikewise Gothic translations of Greek noun phrases may feature a verb and a complement. In both cases, the verb follows the complement, giving weight to the theory that basic word order in Gothic is object–verb. This aligns with what is known of other early Germanic languages.\n\nHowever, this pattern is reversed in imperatives and negations:\n\nAnd in a \"wh\"-question the verb directly follows the question word:\n\nGothic has two clitic particles placed in the second position in a sentence, in accordance with Wackernagel's Law.\n\nOne such clitic particle is -\"u\", indicating a yes–no question or an indirect question, like Latin -\"ne\":\n\nIt should be noted that the prepositional phrase without the clitic -\"u\" appears as \"af þus silbin\": the clitic causes the reversion of originally voiced fricatives, unvoiced at the end of a word, to their voiced form; another such example is \"wileid-u\" \"do you () want\" from \"wileiþ\" \"you () want\". If the first word has a preverb attached, the clitic actually splits the preverb from the verb: \"ga-u-láubjats\" \"do you both believe...?\" from \"galáubjats\" \"you both believe\".\n\nAnother such clitic is \"-uh\" \"and\", appearing as \"-h\" after a vowel: \"ga-h-mēlida\" \"and he wrote\" from \"gamēlida\" \"he wrote\", \"urreis nim-uh\" \"arise and take!\" from the imperative form \"nim\" \"take\". After \"iþ\" or any indefinite besides \"sums\" \"some\" and \"anþar\" \"another\", -\"uh\" cannot be placed; in the latter category, this is only because indefinite determiner phrases cannot move to the front of a clause. It should be pointed out that, unlike, for example, Latin -\"que\", -\"uh\" can only join two or more main clauses. In all other cases, the word \"jah\" \"and\" is used, which can also join main clauses.\n\nMore than one such clitics can occur in one word: \"diz-uh-þan-sat ijōs\" \"and then he seized them ()\" from \"dissat\" \"he seized\" (notice again the voicing of \"diz-\"), \"ga-u-ƕa-sēƕi\" \"whether he saw anything\" from \"gasēƕi\" \"he saw\".\n\nFor the most part, Gothic is known to be significantly closer to Proto-Germanic than any other Germanic language except for that of the (scantily attested) early Norse runic inscriptions, which has made it invaluable in the reconstruction of Proto-Germanic. In fact, Gothic tends to serve as the primary foundation for reconstructing Proto-Germanic. The reconstructed Proto-Germanic conflicts with Gothic only when there is clearly identifiable evidence from other branches that the Gothic form is a secondary development.\n\nGothic fails to display a number of innovations shared by all Germanic languages attested later:\n\nThe language has also preserved many features that have been lost mostly in other early Germanic languages:\n\nMost conspicuously, Gothic shows no sign of morphological umlaut. Gothic \"fotus\", \"fotjus\", can be contrasted with English \"foot\" : \"feet\", German \"Fuß\" : \"Füße\", Old Icelandic \"fótr\" : \"fœtr\", Danish \"fod\" : \"fødder\". These forms contain the characteristic change > (> English , German ) due to i-umlaut; the Gothic form shows no such change.\n\nProto-Germanic *\"z\" remains in Gothic as \"z\" or is devoiced to \"s\". In North and West Germanic, *\"z\" changes to \"r\" by rhotacism.\n\nGothic retains a morphological passive voice inherited from Indo-European but unattested in all other Germanic languages except for the single fossilised form preserved in, for example, Old English \"hātte\" or Runic Norse () \"haitē\" \"am called\", derived from Proto-Germanic \"*haitaną\" \"to call, command\". (It should be noted that the related verbs \"heißen\" in modern German and \"heten\" in Dutch are both derived from the active voice of this verb but have the passive meaning \"to be called\" alongside the dated active meaning \"to command\".)\n\nThe morphological passive in North Germanic languages (Swedish \"gör\" \"does\", \"görs\" \"is being done\") originates from the Old Norse middle voice, which is an innovation not inherited from Indo-European.\n\nUnlike other Germanic languages, which retained dual number marking only in some pronoun forms, Gothic has dual forms both in pronouns and in verbs. Dual verb forms exist in the first and second person only and only in the active voice; in all other cases, the corresponding plural forms are used. In pronouns, Gothic has first and second person dual pronouns: Gothic/Old English/Old Norse \"wit\" \"we two\" (thought to have been in fact derived from \"*wi-du\" literally \"we two\").\n\nGothic possesses a number of verbs which form their preterite by reduplication, another archaic feature inherited from Indo-European. While traces of this category survived elsewhere in Germanic, the phenomenon is largely obscured in these other languages by later sound changes and analogy. In the following examples the infinitive is compared to the third person singular preterite indicative:\n\n\nThe standard theory of the origin of the Germanic languages divides the languages into three groups: East Germanic (Gothic and a few other very scantily-attested languages), North Germanic (Old Norse and its derivatives, such as Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese) and West Germanic (all others, including Old English, Old High German, Old Saxon, Old Low Franconian, Old Frisian and the numerous modern languages derived from these, including English, German, and Dutch). Sometimes, a further grouping, that of the Northwest Germanic languages, is posited as containing the North Germanic and West Germanic languages, reflecting the hypothesis that Gothic was the first attested language to branch off.\n\nA minority opinion (the so-called Gotho-Nordic Hypothesis) instead groups North Germanic and East Germanic together. It is based partly on historical claims: for example, Jordanes, writing in the 6th century, ascribes to the Goths a Scandinavian origin. There are a few linguistically significant areas in which Gothic and Old Norse agree against the West Germanic languages.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is the evolution of the Proto-Germanic *\"-jj-\" and *\"-ww-\" into Gothic \"ddj\" (from Pre-Gothic \"ggj\"?) and \"ggw\", and Old Norse \"ggj\" and \"ggv\" (\"Holtzmann's Law\"), in contrast to West Germanic where they remained as semivowels. Compare Modern English \"true\", German \"treu\", with Gothic \"triggws\", Old Norse \"tryggr\".\n\nHowever, it has been suggested that these are, in fact, two separate and unrelated changes. A number of other posited similarities exist (for example, the existence of numerous inchoative verbs ending in -\"na\", such as Gothic \"ga-waknan\", Old Norse \"vakna\"; and the absence of gemination before \"j\", or (in the case of old Norse) only \"g\" geminated before \"j\", e.g. Proto-Germanic *\"kunją\" > Gothic \"kuni\" (kin), Old Norse \"kyn\", but Old English \"cynn\", Old High German \"kunni\"). However, for the most part these represent shared retentions, which are not valid means of grouping languages. That is, if a parent language splits into three daughters A, B and C, and C innovates in a particular area but A and B do not change, A and B will appear to agree against C. That shared retention in A and B is not necessarily indicative of any special relationship between the two.\n\nSimilar claims of similarities between Old Gutnish (\"Gutniska\") and Old Icelandic are also based on shared retentions rather than shared innovations.\n\nAnother commonly-given example involves Gothic and Old Norse verbs with the ending \"-t\" in the 2nd person singular preterite indicative, and the West Germanic languages have \"-i\". The ending \"-t\" can regularly descend from the Proto-Indo-European perfect ending \"*-th₂e\", while the origin of the West Germanic ending \"-i\" (which, unlike the \"-t\"-ending, unexpectedly combines with the zero-grade of the root as in the plural) is unclear, suggesting that it is an innovation of some kind, possibly an import from the optative. Another possibility is that this is an example of independent choices made from a doublet existing in the proto-language. That is, Proto-Germanic may have allowed either \"-t\" or \"-i\" to be used as the ending, either in free variation or perhaps depending on dialects within Proto-Germanic or the particular verb in question. Each of the three daughters independently standardized on one of the two endings and, by chance, Gothic and Old Norse ended up with the same ending.\n\nOther isoglosses have led scholars to propose an early split between East and Northwest Germanic. Furthermore, features shared by any two branches of Germanic do not necessarily require the postulation of a proto-language excluding the third, as the early Germanic languages were all part of a dialect continuum in the early stages of their development, and contact between the three branches of Germanic was extensive.\n\nPolish linguist Witold Mańczak had argued that Gothic is closer to German (specifically Upper German) than to Scandinavian and suggests that their ancestral homeland was located southernmost part of the Germanic territories, close to present day Austria rather than in Scandinavia. Frederik Kortlandt has agreed with Mańczak's hypothesis, stating: \"I think that his argument is correct and that it is time to abandon Iordanes' classic view that the Goths came from Scandinavia.\"\n\nThe reconstructed Proto-Slavic language features several apparent borrowed words from East Germanic (presumably Gothic), such as \"xlěbъ\", \"bread\", vs. Gothic \"hlaifs\".\n\nSeveral linguists have made use of Gothic as a creative language. The most famous example is \"Bagme Bloma\" (\"Flower of the Trees\") by J. R. R. Tolkien, part of \"Songs for the Philologists\". It was published privately in 1936 for Tolkien and his colleague E. V. Gordon.\nTolkien's use of Gothic is also known from a letter from 1965 to Zillah Sherring. When she bought a copy of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in Salisbury, she found strange inscriptions in it; after she found his name in it, she wrote him a letter and asked him if the inscriptions were his, including the longest one on the back, which was in Gothic. In his reply to her he corrected some of the mistakes in the text; he wrote for example that \"hundai\" should be \"hunda\" and \"þizo boko\" (of those books), which he suggested should be \"þizos bokos\" (of this book). A semantic inaccuracy of the text which he mentioned himself is the use of \"lisan\" for read, while this was \"ussiggwan\". Tolkien also made a calque of his own name in Gothic in the letter, which according to him should be \"Ruginwaldus Dwalakoneis\".\n\nThe Thorvaldsen museum also has an alliterative poem, \"Thunravalds Sunau\", from 1841 by Massmann, the first publisher of the Skeireins, written in the Gothic language. It was read at a great feast dedicated to Thorvaldsen in the Gesellschaft der Zwanglosen in Munich on July 15, 1841. This event is mentioned by Ludwig Schorn in the magazine Kunstblatt from the 19th of July, 1841. Massmann also translated the academic commercium song \"Gaudeamus\" into Gothic in 1837.\n\nIn 2012, professor Bjarne Simmelkjær Hansen of the University of Copenhagen published a translation into Gothic of \"Adeste Fideles\" for Roots of Europe.\n\nIn \"Fleurs du Mal\", an online magazine for art and literature, the poem \"Overvloed\" of Dutch poet Bert Bevers appeared in a Gothic translation.\n\nAlice in Wonderland has been translated into Gothic (Balþos Gadedeis Aþalhaidais in Sildaleikalanda) by David Carlton in 2015 and is published by Michael Everson.\n\n\n\n"}

Its focal points were:\n\n\nThe Historical Behaviour Studies (Historische Verhaltensforschung) were established in 1971 by August Nitschke and Henning Eichberg as a department of the University of Stuttgart. The Department of Historical Behaviour Studies was part of the newly established Institute of Social Research, side by side with departments of social planning and social economy. Later on, historians like Johannes Burkhardt , Andreas Kalckhoff, Harald Kleinschmidt, Volker Saftien and Michael Walter joined the department. Others like Wolfgang Christian Schneider, Andreas Gestrich , Mathias Beer und Katja Erdmann-Rajski worked in connection with the department and used similar methods of research.\n\nThe research of this Stuttgart school of studies in human behaviour was to a certain extent parallel to the History of Mentalities from France, to the Cultural Sociology (Kultursoziologie ) from Germany and Denmark, and to the Historical Anthropology or \"Alltagsgeschichte\" from Germany which arose in the 1990s. Referring to Ruth Benedict, Norbert Elias and Michel Foucault, the patterns of human behaviour were called “configurations” (→Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)).\n\nThe Stuttgart school of Historical Behaviour Studies directed special attention towards fundamental and abrupt changes of behavior and society, as they could be observed in the context of the Renaissance 1550–1650, of the Industrial Revolution around 1770–1820, and in cultural change around 1900–1930. Other changes were studied for the Middle Ages. These historical case studies could lead to questions concerning the significance and change of behaviour at present and in the future.\n\nA particular characteristic of the Stuttgart studies of historical behaviour was the comparative turn towards non-Western societies like Indonesia, Japan, and China.\n\nWhile the Stuttgart school generally focused on “describing” (→description) and “understanding” different forms and changes of historical behaviour, the “explanation” of cultural difference and change was discussed diversely. Eichberg emphasized the irreducible otherness (alterity) of foreign behavior; “extraneous” patterns withdraw from the explanations of the external observer and develop, also in modernity, on ways quite different from Western standard. Nitschke tried to find explanations for the historical dynamics of different cultures by models of energy and time expectation; this met with observations of self-organization (→Synergetics (Haken)) as reported in physics and biology. Common for the Stuttgart school was a skeptical distance towards the traditional explanation of historical change by ideologies, individual intentions, general social structures or one global process of sociocultural evolution.\n\nThe Historical Behaviour Studies contributed among others to the history of popular culture, and of peace and war, to the study of paradigm changes in natural sciences, to the history of art and of the public sphere. They had a special impact on the international study of body culture (physical culture). The Danish school of body culture studies developed the analysis of configurations – social space, social time, inter-human relations, atmospheres and emotions, and the objectifying of movement – towards the study of sport and other movement cultures (p. e. musical gesture) in diverse societies and social formations.\n\nBeer, Mathias (1990): \"Eltern und Kinder des späten Mittelalters in ihren Briefen.

{"id": "1247285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1247285", "title": "Hmong language", "text": "Hmong language\n\nHmong (RPA: \"Hmoob\") or Mong (RPA: \"Moob\"), known as First Vernacular Chuanqiandian Miao in China (), is a dialect continuum of the West Hmongic branch of the Hmongic languages spoken by the Hmong of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, northern Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos. There are some 2.7 million speakers of varieties that are largely mutually intelligible, including over 280,000 Hmong Americans as of 2013. Over half of all Hmong speakers speak the various dialects in China, where the Dananshan (大南山) dialect forms the basis of the standard language. However, Hmong Daw (White Miao) and Mong Njua (Green Miao) are widely known only in Laos and the United States; Dananshan is more widely known in the native region of Hmong.\n\nHmong, in the narrow sense, is sometimes known ambiguously as the Chuanqiandian Cluster. That term is also used for Chuanqiandian Miao as a whole, or it may be restricted to the varieties of Hmong spoken in China.\n\nMong Njua (Hmoob Ntsuab) and Hmong Daw (Hmoob Dawb) are part of a dialect cluster known in China as \"Chuanqiandian Miao\", that is, \"Sichuan–Guizhou–Yunnan Miao\", called the \"Chuanqiandian cluster\" in English, as West Hmongic is also called \"Chuanqiandian\". Mong Njua and Hmong Daw are just those varieties of the cluster that migrated to Laos; the Western names \"Mong Njua, Mong Leng, Hmong Dleu/Der,\" and \"Hmong Daw\" are also used in China for various dialects of the Chuanqiandian cluster.\n\nEthnologue once distinguished only the Laotian varieties (Hmong Daw, Mong Njua), Sinicized Miao (Hmong Shua), and the Vietnamese varieties (Hmong Do, Hmong Don). The Vietnamese varieties are very poorly known; population estimates are not even available. In 2007, Horned Miao, Small Flowery Miao, and the Chuanqiandian cluster of China were split off from Mong Njua [blu]. These varieties are as follows, along with some alternate names ('Ch.' = Chinese name, 'auto.' = autonym [self name]):\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that the White and Green dialects \"are said to be mutually intelligible to a well-trained ear, with pronunciation and vocabulary differences analogous to the differences between British and American English.\"\n\nMany of the above names used outside (White Miao, Blue/Green Miao, Flowery Miao, Mong Leng, etc.) are also used in China. Several Chinese varieties may be more distinct than the varieties listed above:\n\nIn the 2007 request to establish an ISO code for the Chuanqiandian cluster, corresponding to the \"first local dialect\" (第一土語) of the Chuanqiandian cluster in Chinese, the proposer made the following statement on mutual intelligibility:\nThe CDC stated \"although there is no official preference for one dialect over the other, White Hmong seems to be favored in many ways.\" The agency stated that the Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA) is closest to that of White Hmong, most educated Hmong speak White Hmong, and that most Hmong dictionaries only include the White Hmong dialect. Younger generations of Hmong are more likely to speak White Hmong. Speakers of Green Hmong are more likely to learn White Hmong than speakers of White Hmong learning Green Hmong.\n\nMost Hmong in the United States speak the dialects White Hmong and Green Hmong with about 60% speaking White Hmong and about 40% speaking Green Hmong. The CDC stated that \"though some Hmong report difficulty understanding speakers of a dialect not their own, for the most part, White and Green Hmong speakers seem to understand one another\".\n\nThe three dialects described here are known as Hmong Daw (also called White Miao or \"Hmong Der\"), Mong Njua (also called Blue or Green Miao or \"Mong Leng\"), and Dananshan (Standard Chinese Miao). Hmong Daw and Mong Njua are the two major dialects spoken by Hmong Americans. Although mutually intelligible, the dialects differ in both lexicon and certain aspects of phonology. For instance, Mong Njua lacks the voiceless/aspirated of Hmong Daw (as exemplified by their names) and has a third nasalized vowel, ; Dananshan has a couple of extra diphthongs in native words, numerous Chinese loans, and an eighth tone.\n\nThe vowel systems of Hmong Daw and Mong Njua are as shown in the following charts. Phonemes particular to each dialect are color-coded respectively:\n\nThe Dananshan standard of China is similar. Phonemic differences from Hmong Daw and Mong Njua are color-coded.\n\nDananshan occurs only after non-palatal affricates, and is written , much like Mandarin Chinese. is pronounced after palatal consonants. There is also a triphthong , as well as other i- and u-initial sequences in Chinese borrowings, such as .\n\nHmong makes a number of phonemic contrasts unfamiliar to English speakers. All non-glottal stops and affricates distinguish aspirated and unaspirated forms, most also prenasalization independently of this. The consonant inventory of Hmong is shown in the chart below. (Consonants particular to Hmong Daw and Mong Njua are color-coded respectively.)\n\nThe Dananshan standard of China is similar. (Phonemic differences from Hmong Daw and Mong Njua are color-coded. Minor differences, such as the voicing of prenasalized stops, or whether is an affricate or is velar, may be a matter of transcription.) Aspirates, voiceless fricatives, voiceless nasals, and glottal stop only occur with \"yin\" tones (1, 3, 5, 7). Standard orthography is added in . Glottal stop is not written; it is not distinct from a zero initial. There is also a , which occurs only in foreign words.\n\nHmong syllables have a very simple structure: onsets are obligatory (except in a few particles), nuclei may consist of a monophthong or diphthong, and coda consonants apart from nasals are prohibited. In Hmong Daw and Mong Njua, nasal codas have become nasal vowels, though they may be accompanied by a weak coda . Similarly, a weak coda may accompany the low-falling creaky tone.\n\nDananshan has a syllabic (written ) in Chinese loans, such as \"lf\" 'two' and \"lx\" 'child'.\n\nHmong is a tone language and makes use of seven (Hmong Daw and Mong Njua) or eight (Dananshan) distinct tones.\nThe Dananshan tones are transcribed as pure tone. However, given how similar several of them are, it is likely that there are also phonational differences as in Hmong Daw and Mong Njua. Tones 4 and 6, for example, are said to make tenuis plosives breathy voiced (浊送气), suggesting they may be breathy/murmured like the Hmong \"g\"-tone. Tones 7 and 8 are used in early Chinese loans with entering tone, suggesting they may once have marked checked syllables.\n\nBecause voiceless consonants apart from tenuis plosives are restricted to appearing before certain tones (1, 3, 5, 7), those are placed first in the table:\n\nSo much information is conveyed by the tones that it is possible to speak intelligibly using musical tunes only; there is a tradition of young lovers communicating covertly this way by playing on a jew's harp (though this method may also convey vowel sounds).\n\nRobert Cooper, an anthropologist, collected a Hmong folktale saying that the Hmong used to have a written language, and important information was written down in a treasured book. The folktale explains that cows and rats ate the book, so, in the words of Anne Fadiman, author of \"The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down\", \"no text was equal to the task of representing a culture as rich as that of the Hmong.\" Therefore, the folktale states that the Hmong language was exclusively oral from that point onwards.\n\nNatalie Jill Smith, author of \"Ethnicity, Reciprocity, Reputation and Punishment: An Ethnoexperimental Study of Cooperation among the Chaldeans and Hmong of Detroit (Michigan)\", wrote that the Qing Dynasty had caused a previous Hmong writing system to die out when it stated that the death penalty would be imposed on those who wrote it down.\n\nSince the end of the 19th century, linguists created over two dozen Hmong writing systems, including systems using Chinese characters, the Lao alphabet, the Russian alphabet, the Thai alphabet, and the Vietnamese alphabet. In addition, in 1959 Shong Lue Yang, a Hmong spiritual leader from Laos, created an 81 symbol writing system called Pahawh. Yang was not previously literate in any language. Chao Fang, an anti-Laotian government Hmong group, uses this writing system.\n\nIn the 1980s, Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script was created by a Hmong Minister, Reverend Chervang Kong Vang, to be able to capture Hmong vocabulary clearly and also to remedy redundancies in the language as well as address semantic confusions that was lacking in other scripts. Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script was mainly used by United Christians Liberty Evangelical Church, a church also founded by Vang, although the script have been found to be in use in Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, France, and Australia. The script bears strong resemblance to the Lao alphabet in structure and form and characters inspired from the Hebrew alphabets, although the characters themselves are different.\n\nOther experiments by Hmong and non-Hmong orthographers have been undertaken using invented letters.\n\nThe Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA), the most widely used script for Hmong Daw and Mong Njua, was developed in Laos between 1951 and 1953 by three Western missionaries. In the United States Hmong do not use RPA for spelling of proper nouns, because they want their names to be easily pronounced by people unfamiliar with RPA. For instance Hmong in the U.S. spell \"Hmoob\" as \"Hmong,\" and \"Liab Lis\" is spelled as Lia Lee.\n\nThe Dananshan standard in China is written in a pinyin-based alphabet, with tone letters similar to those used in RPA.\n\nThe following is a list of pairs of RPA and Dananshan segments having the same sound (or very similar sounds). Note however that RPA and the standard in China not only differ in orthographic rules, but are also used to write different languages. The list is ordered alphabetically by the RPA, apart from prenasalized stops and voiceless sonorants, which come after their oral and voiced homologues. There are three overriding patterns to the correspondences: RPA doubles a vowel for nasalization, whereas pinyin uses ; RPA uses for aspiration, whereas pinyin uses the voicing distinction of the Latin script; pinyin uses (and ) to derive the retroflex and uvular series from the dental and velar, whereas RPA uses sequences based on vs. for the same.\nThere is no simple correspondence between the tone letters. The historical connection between the tones is as follows. The Chinese names reflect the tones given to early Chinese loan words with those tones in Chinese.\n\nTones 4 and 7 merged in Hmoob Dawb, whereas tones 4 and 6 merged in Mong Njua.\n\nExample: \"lus Hmoob\" (White Hmong) / \"lug Moob\" (Green Hmong) / \"lol Hmongb\" (Dananshan) \"Hmong language\".\n\nHmong is an analytic SVO language in which adjectives and demonstratives follow the noun. Noun phrases can contain the following elements (parentheses indicate optional elements):\n\nThe Hmong pronominal system distinguishes between three grammatical persons and three numbers – singular, dual, and plural. They are not marked for case, that is, the same word is used to translate both \"I\" and \"me\", \"she\" and \"her\", and so forth. These are the personal pronouns of Hmong Daw and Mong Njua:\n\nHmong is an isolating language in which most morphemes are monosyllables. As a result, verbs are not overtly inflected. Tense, aspect, mood, person, number, gender, and case are indicated lexically.\n\nHmong verbs can be serialized, with two or more verbs combined in one clause. It is common for as many as five verbs to be strung together, sharing the same subject.\n\nHere is an example from White Hmong:\n\"Yam zoo tshaj plaws, nej yuav tsum mus nrhiav nug xyuas saib luag muaj kev pab hom dab tsi nyob ncig ib cheeb tsam ntawm nej.\"\nThing best, you (plural) must go seek, ask, examine, look others have services variations what on tour the area at you (plural)\n'The best thing you can do is to explore your neighborhood and find out what services are available.'\n\nBecause the verb form in Hmong does not change to indicate tense, the simplest way to indicate the time of an event is to use temporal adverb phrases like \"last year,\" \"today,\" or \"next week.\"\n\nHere is an example from White Hmong:\n\nAspectual differences are indicated by a number of verbal modifiers. Here are the most common ones:\n\nProgressive: (Mong Njua) \"taab tom\" + verb, (White Hmong) \"tab tom\" + verb = situation in progress\n\n\"Taab/tab tom\" + verb can also be used to indicate a situation that is about to start. That is clearest when \"taab/tab\" tom occurs in conjunction with the irrealis marker \"yuav\". Note that the \"taab tom\" construction is not used if it is clear from the context that a situation is ongoing or about to begin.\n\nPerfective: sentence/clause + \"lawm\" = completed situation\n\n\"Lawm\" at the end of a sentence can also indicate that an action is underway:\n\nAnother common way to indicate the accomplishment of an action or attainment is by using \"tau\", which, as a main verb, means 'to get/obtain.' It takes on different connotations when it is combined with other verbs. When it occurs before the main verb (i.e. \"tau\" + verb), it conveys the attainment or fulfillment of a situation. Whether the situation took place in the past, the present, or the future is indicated at the discourse level rather than the sentence level. If the event took place in the past, \"tau\" + verb translates to the past tense in English.\n\n\"Tau\" is optional if an explicit past time marker is present (e.g. \"nag hmo\", last night). \"Tau\" can also mark the fulfillment of a situation in the future:\n\nWhen \"tau\" follows the main verb (i.e. verb + \"tau\"), it indicates the accomplishment of the purpose of an action.\n\n\"Tau\" is also common in serial verb constructions that are made up of a verb, followed by an accomplishment: (White Hmong) \"nrhiav tau\", to look for; \"caum tau\", to chase; \"yug tau\", to give birth.\n\nFuture: yuav + verb:\n\n\"Yuav\" + verb may also be seen as indicative of the irrealis mood, for situations that are unfulfilled or unrealized. That includes hypothetical or non-occurring situations with past, present, or future time references:\n\nIn 2012 McDonald's introduced its first Hmong language advertising in the United States on a commercial billboard in Saint Paul, Minnesota. However it was unintelligible to Hmong speakers due to an incorrect translation. Google Translate introduced support for Hmong Daw (referred to only as \"Hmong\") in May 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Roughly 60% consist of expatriate IT professionals and their families.\n\nAccording to the \"Nihon Shoki\", in 654 two men and two women of the Tushara Kingdom, along with one woman from Shravasti, were driven by a storm to take refuge at the former Hyūga Province in southern Kyushu. They remained for several years before setting off for home.\n\nThe history of modern Indian settlement in Japan goes back more than a century. As early as 1873, a few Indian businessmen and their families, primarily Parsis and Sindhis, had settled Yokohama as well as Okinawa. In 1891, Tata, then a small trading firm, established a branch in Kobe. By 1901, Japanese government statistics recorded 30 people from British India living in Japan. Local statistics of the Hyōgo Prefecture government showed 59 Indians living in the prefecture in 1905, among whom all but one were men. After the destruction wreaked on Yokohama in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, the Indian traders there also migrated to Kobe; from then on, Kobe became the centre of gravity of Japan's Indian community.\n\nBy 1939, on the eve of World War II, the number of Indians in Hyōgo Prefecture had reached 632. However, due to British sanctions against Japan and the 1941 halt of shipping between Japan and their homeland, many closed their shops and left; by 1942, there were only 114 remaining. Three years after the Partition of India, their numbers had recovered somewhat to 255. Prior to 1990, the Indian community in Japan remained centred on the Kobe area. However, after 1990, the numbers in Tokyo began to show a sharp increase. Migrants who arrived in the 1990s included industrial trainees sent by Japanese car manufacturers which had set up factories in India. IT professionals and their families also came to Tokyo, settling primarily in Setagaya and Minato wards.\n\n, there were also around 800 Indians working in the IT industry in Japan, up from 120 in 1993. Kenichi Yoshida, a director of the Softbridge Solutions Japan Co., stated in late 2009 that the Indian engineers are becoming the backbone of Japan's IT industry and that \"it is important for Japanese industry to work together with the India.\" Another 870 Indians were employed as cooks. Others are engaged in trading, importing the Indian handicrafts, garments, precious stones, and marine products, and exporting Japanese electronic goods, textiles, automotive parts, and jewellery.\n\nIndians in Japan speak a number of different languages and follow various religions; there is little correlation between religion or language and profession, except in the case of the Jains, many of whom work in the jewellery industry. The Jains are generally concentrated around Okachi-machi in Taitō, Tokyo. On the whole, Tokyo has fewer religious facilities for Indians than does Kobe.\n\nThere are Sikh gurudwara in both Kobe and Tokyo; the latter is of more recent provenance, having been founded in 1999 in the basement of an office building. Some Sikhs employed as unskilled labourers in small and medium enterprises had to cut their hair short and remove their turbans in violation of the principle of \"kesh\", because their employers are unfamiliar with their customs and do not give them any latitude in their style of dress. They consider this just a temporary adaptation to Japanese society. However, this practise is not common among Sikhs in skilled professions such as IT.\n\nThere has been a recent migration of Marathi Buddhist community in Japan. These community came to Japan in search of jobs is now also emerging as a business community. These people speak Marathi at home and Japanese at work. These people are originally followers of Navayana Buddhism have now started syncretising with Japanese Buddhism.\n\nIndians who send their children to school in Japan generally select English-medium schools. The first Indian-specific school was established in 2004 in Tokyo's Koto ward at the initiative of some of the old trading families based in Tokyo and Yokohama. The school's name is IISJ which stands for India International School in Japan. The Global Indian International School, a Singapore-based school, has operated a branch in Tokyo since 2006, and plans to open another in Yokohama in 2008. They follow the Indian Central Board of Secondary Education curriculum. The schools are popular not just among Indian expatriates, but among some Japanese as well, due to a reputation for rigour in mathematics education. Other migrants leave their children behind in their native states, either with grandparents or at the boarding schools, in order to avoid interrupting their education.\n\nJeevarani \"Rani Sanku\" Angelina, established the Little Angels International School, which caters to Japanese students.\n\nOne of the earliest Indian community organisations, the Oriental Club, was established in 1904 in Kobe; it changed its name to The India Club in 1913, and continued operating up to the present day. More were founded in the 1930s, including the Indian-dominated Silk Merchants' Association, the Indian Social Society, and the Indian Chamber of Commerce. In 2000, Indian expatriates living in Edogawa, Tokyo, an area with a high concentration of Indian IT engineers founded the Indian Community of Edogawa. Others include the Indian Community Activities Tokyo, whose Diwali celebration draws 2,500 participants, as well as the Indian Merchants Association of Yokohama.\nJapan Tamil Sangam is the registered community organization in Japan. It is the biggest community organizations for uniting Tamil speakers with more than 4000 members. The Tamilar Thirunal Pongal festival, Food and sports festival Vanakkam Thamizhagam draws large crowds in Edogawa Tokyo every year.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1004803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1004803", "title": "Kingsley Hall", "text": "Kingsley Hall\n\nKingsley Hall is a community centre, at Bromley-by-Bow in the East End of London. It dates back to the work of Doris Lester and Muriel Lester, who had a nursery school in nearby Bruce Road. Their brother, Kingsley Lester, died aged 26 in 1914, leaving money for work in the local area for \"educational, social and recreational\" purposes, with which the Lesters bought and converted a disused chapel. The current Hall was built on Powis Road, with a stone-laying ceremony taking place on July 14, 1927. An additional Church and community centre has also been built on Parslows Ave. Dagenham. This also holds the Kingsley Hall name and is undergoing redevelopment.\n\nDuring the General Strike of 1926, Kingsley Hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Mohandas Gandhi stayed in Kingsley Hall in 1931 and the building now houses the Gandhi Foundation. The room where he stayed has been preserved. In 1935, hunger marchers on the Jarrow March stayed at the Hall.\n\nIn 1965 R. D. Laing and his associates asked the Lesters for permission to use the Hall as an alternative community for treating people affected by mental health crisis. Kingsley Hall became home to one of the most radical experiments in psychology of the time. The aim of the experiment by the Philadelphia Association was to create a model for non-restraining, non-drug therapies for those people seriously affected by schizophrenia.\nThe idea of starting this type of community was an initiative suggested by Mary Barnes a former nurse and first resident as patient.\n\nThe hall was designated a Grade II listed building in September 1973.\n\nIn 1912, Doris and Muriel Lester started a Nursery School at numbers 58 and 60 Bruce Road. Children were fed, clothed and cared for at a charge of one shilling (five pence a day). When mothers could not afford fees, children were sponsored by a network of wealthier supporters. The service was soon expanded to include activities for older groups with the aim to provide for the development of the whole person – the mind, body and spirit – in an environment which brought people together regardless of class, race and religion.\n\nKingsley Lester died in 1914, leaving what money he had for work in Bow towards \"educational, social and recreational\" purposes. Doris and Muriel Lester bought an old chapel on the corner of Eagling Road in 1915, which was then re-decorated and fitted out by local volunteers. It was a \"people's house\", where friends and neighbours, workmen, factory girls and children of Bow came together for \"worship, study, fun and friendship\". The premises became known as Kingsley Hall, and operated a Nursery, as well as social events, concerts and adult school. Football, Sunday services and summer holiday schemes were also begun.\n\nDuring World War I, in the face of criticism, Doris and Muriel remained pacifists. Kingsley Hall ran a soup kitchen and stayed open at night for Air Raid Wardens. At the end of the war, Doris and Muriel joined a march to the House of Commons demanding that milk be sent to Germany, where people were starving. A German child was adopted by the members of Kingsley Hall who paid for her to stay with a local family for two years.\n\nAfter the War, Kingsley Hall maintained strong links with the Suffragettes in east London. Activists campaigned for votes for women in the face of threats. Muriel Lester spoke on street corners and on Sunday mornings in Victoria Park. After her talks local people contributed towards maintaining services at Kingsley Hall. Muriel became an Alderman on the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar and fought for basic provisions such as milk for children under five.\n\nThe Lester's father, Henry Lester, was a shipbuilder. He bought a cottage in Loughton, (then a countryside district of Essex), to be used as a holiday place by families from Bow. Named after his deceased wife, \"Rachel Cottage\" also served to provide holidays for nursery children.\n\nEnough money was saved to build the Children's House on Bruce Road which was opened by H.G. Wells in 1923. The foundation stones represent: Vision, Nature, Rhythm and Music; Beauty, Health, Education, Motherhood, Internationalism and Fellowship. The \"Children's House\" continues to be run as a Nursery School.\n\nDuring the 1926 General Strike, the hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Larger accommodations were needed as the popularity of Kingsley Hall grew, and a new Kingsley Hall was built on Powis Road, with funds from people in the neighbourhood and donations from wealthy patrons. The architect was Charles Cowles Voysey.\n\nA Stone-laying ceremony took place on July 14, 1927. The following people laid stones representing different aspects.\n\n\nKingsley Hall (on Powis Road) was opened on September 15, 1928. The building included residential units or cells, and also had a clubroom and dining room, kitchen, office and a space of worship. \n\nThe new building would receive its most famous visitor just a few years after it opened. In 1931 Mahatma Gandhi accepted an invitation to stay there while on his visit to England. \n\"The same year (1931), Muriel told us that Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall...when he arrived, I think all the people in East London waited outside to see him.\"\n\"...besides doing his work with the Government, he spent a lot of time with us. He visited the Nursery School and all the children called him Uncle Gandhi. At six o'clock each morning, after his prayers, he took his walk along the canal, talking to workmen on the way... There was something about him that always lives with the people.\"\n\nGandhi lived at Kingsley Hall for 12 weeks. Stories that he was accompanied by a goat however, were pure press invention. Among Gandhi's visitors were Charlie Chaplin, George Bernard Shaw, the Pearly King and Queen of east London, many politicians including David Lloyd George and the Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang. Muriel Lester later accompanied Mahatma Gandhi on his tour of earthquake-shaken regions in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.\n\nIn 1935 Ellen Wilkinson led the Jarrow March to London, and some of the men were put up at Kingsley Hall. It was the poor helping the poor. They collected their pennies and opened the jumble store for them. Muriel Lester visited the Far East, USA, China, Japan and India to report to the League of Nations on drug investigations in the regions. Muriel Lester retired from full-time work in 1958 and in 1963 she became a \"Freeman of the Borough of Poplar\" on her eightieth birthday. Muriel Lester died in 1967.\n\nFollowing World War II, with the welfare state having undertaken much of the work advocated by the Lester sisters, Kingsley Hall continued on a quieter note as a youth hostel and community activity centre.\n\nIn 1965 R. D. Laing and his colleagues asked the Lesters for use of the Hall as a community for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result Kingsley Hall became home to the Philadelphia Association and one of the most radical experiments in psychiatry. Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness simply to be eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space to explore their madness and internal chaos. Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.\n\nOne notable resident of this experiment was Mary Barnes. Along with resident psychiatrist Joseph Berke, Mary later went on to write \"Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness\", describing her stay at Kingsley Hall and use of her mental condition as a vehicle for painting and creative expression. Her account became famous in the 1970s when it was used as the basis for the play \"Mary Barnes\" by David Edgar. Another notable resident was the renowned Norwegian author Axel Jensen.\n\nThe activities of residents in the \"no-holds barred\" experiment made the local community largely hostile to the project, and there were regular reports of harassment. After five years (from 1965 to 1970) the project was wound up and Kingsley Hall was boarded up. During the seventies it was severely damaged.\n\nIn the 1980s Kingsley Hall was one of the sets used in the film \"Gandhi\". During the filming Richard Attenborough united with the Kingsley Hall Action Group to raise enough funds to carry out an extensive refurbishing. Many of the local community contributed their skills and commitment to bring Kingsley Hall back into a usable community centre.\n\nKingsley Hall was reopened 2 March 1985 with events in the week preceding, and has since gone on to be used for activities ranging from youth groups, holiday outings or arts and photography workshops, for advice surgeries, wedding functions and educational projects. It also houses the office of the Gandhi Foundation, which pursues interests of peace internationally, in the tradition of its namesake.\n\nIn 1995, The Hall suffered two major burglaries when vandals broke in and burnt down the offices. The committed staff and volunteers were devastated by this destruction, but continued to run youth groups, advice sessions, clubs and meetings. The management interprets its remit as serving the local community and the cause of international peace and to do so in exciting and innovatory ways.\n\n"}

Their highest concentrations are found south of in the Republic of the Congo, southwest of Pool Malebo and west of the Kwango River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and north of Luanda, Angola. They are the largest ethnic group in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and one of the major ethnic groups in the other two countries they are found in. In 1975, the Kongo population was reported as 4,040,000.\n\nThe Kongo people were among the earliest sub-Saharan Africans to welcome Portuguese traders in 1483 CE, and began converting to Catholicism in the late 15th century. They were among the first to protest slavery in letters to the King of Portugal in the 1510s and 1520s, then succumbed to the demands for slaves from the Portuguese through the 16th century. The Kongo people were a part of the major slave raiding, capture and export trade of African slaves to the European colonial interests in 17th and 18th century. The slave raids, colonial wars and the 19th-century Scramble for Africa split the Kongo people into Portuguese, Belgian and French parts. In the early 20th century, they became one of the most active ethnic groups in the efforts to decolonize Africa, helping liberate the three nations to self governance. They now occupy influential positions in the politics, administration and business operations in the three countries they are most found in.\n\nThe origin of the name Kongo is unclear, and several theories have been proposed. According to the colonial era scholar Samuel Nelson, the term \"Kongo\" is possibly derived from a local verb for gathering or assembly. According to Alisa LaGamma, the root may be from the regional word \"N'kongo\" which means \"hunter\" in the context of someone adventurous and heroic. Douglas Harper states that the term means \"mountains\" in the Bantu language, which is the root of the name of the countries and river that flows through the mountains of Congo region.\n\nThe Kongo people have been referred to by various names in the colonial French, Belgian and Portuguese literature, names such as \"Esikongo\" (singular \"Mwisikongo\"), \"Mucicongo\", \"Mesikongo\", \"Madcongo\" and \"Moxicongo\". Christian missionaries, particularly in the Caribbean, originally applied the term \"Bafiote\" (singular \"M(a)fiote\") to the slaves from the Vili or Fiote coastal Kongo people, but later this term was used to refer to any \"black man\" in Cuba, St Lucia and other colonial era Islands ruled by one of the European colonial interests. The group is identified largely by speaking a cluster of mutually intelligible dialects rather than by large continuities in their history or even in culture. The term “Congo” was more widely deployed to identify Kikongo-speaking people enslaved in the Americas.\n\nSince the early twentieth century, \"Bakongo\" (singular \"M’Kongo\" or \"Mukongo\") has been increasingly used, especially in areas north of the Congo river, to refer to the Kikongo-speaking community, or more broadly to speakers of the closely related Kongo languages. This convention is based on the Bantu languages, to which Kongo language belongs. The prefix \"mu-\" and \"ba-\" refer to \"people\", singular and plural respectively.\n\nThe ancient history of the Kongo people has been difficult to ascertain. The region is close to East Africa, considered to be a key to the prehistoric human migrations. This geographical proximity, states Vansina, suggests that the Congo river region, home of the Kongo people, was populated thousands of years ago. Ancient archeological evidence linked to Kongo people has not been found, and glottochronology – or the estimation of ethnic group chronologies based on language evolution – has been applied to the Kongo. Based on this, it is likely the Kongo language and Gabon-Congo language split about 950 BCE.\n\nThe earliest archeological evidence related to this region, where the Kongo people are concentrated, is from Tchissanga, a site dated to about 600 BCE. However, the site does not prove which ethnic group was resident at that time. The Kongo people had settled into the area well before the fifth century CE, begun a society that utilized the diverse and rich resources of region and developed farming methods. According to James Denbow, social complexity had probably been achieved by the second century CE.\n\nSmall kingdoms and Kongo principalities appeared in the current region by the 1200 CE, but documented history of this period of Kongo people if it existed has not survived into the modern era. Detailed and copious description about the Kongo people who lived next to the Atlantic ports of the region, as a sophisticated culture, language and infrastructure, appear in the 15th century, written by the Portuguese explorers. Later anthropological work on the Kongo of the region come from the colonial era writers, particularly the French and Belgians (Loango, Vungu, and the Niari Valley), but this too is limited and does not exhaustively cover all of the Kongo people. The evidence suggests, states Vansina, that the Kongo people were advanced in their culture and socio-political systems with multiple kingdoms well before the arrival of first Portuguese ships in the late 15th century.\n\nArchaeological evidence, Portuguese documents and Kongo oral tradition suggest that the Kingdom of Kongo was founded in the 14th century. The kingdom was modeled not on hereditary succession as was common in Europe, but based on an election by the court nobles from the Kongo people. This required the king to win his legitimacy by a process of recognizing his peers, consensus building as well as regalia and religious ritualism. The kingdom had many trading centers both near rivers and inland, distributed across hundreds of kilometers and Mbanza Kongo – its capital that was about 200 kilometers inland from the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe Portuguese arrived on the Central African coast north of the Congo river, several times between 1472 and 1483 searching for a sea route to India, but they failed to find any ports or trading opportunities. In 1483, south of the Congo river they found the Kongo people and the Kingdom of Kongo, which had a centralized government, a currency called \"nzimbu\", and markets, ready for trading relations. The Portuguese found well developed transport infrastructure inlands from the Kongo people's Atlantic port settlement. They also found exchange of goods easy and the Kongo people open to ideas. The Kongo king at that time, named Nzinga a Nkuwu allegedly willingly accepted Christianity, and at his baptism in 1491 changed his name to João I, a Portuguese name.\n\nThe trade between Kongo people and Portuguese people thereafter accelerated through 1500. The kingdom of Kongo appeared to become receptive of the new traders, allowed them to settle an uninhabited nearby island called São Tomé, and sent Bakongo nobles to visit the royal court in Portugal. Other than the king himself, much of the Kongo people's nobility welcomed the cultural exchange, the Christian missionaries converted them to the Catholic faith, they assumed Portuguese court manners, and by early 16th-century Kongo became a Portugal-affiliated Christian kingdom.\n\nInitially, the Kongo people exchanged ivory and copper objects they made with luxury goods of Portuguese. But, after 1500, the Portuguese had little demand for ivory and copper, they instead demanded slaves in exchange. The settled Portuguese in São Tomé needed slave labor for their sugarcane plantations, and they first purchased labor. Soon thereafter they began kidnapping people from the Kongo society and after 1514, they provoked military campaigns in nearby African regions to get slave labor. Along with this change in Portuguese-Kongo people relationship, the succession system within Kongo kingdom changed under Portuguese influence, and in 1509, instead of the usual election among the nobles, a hereditary European-style succession led to the African king Afonso I succeeding his father, now named João I. The slave capture and the export of slaves caused major social disorder among the Kongo people, and the Kongo king Afonso I wrote letters to the king of Portugal protesting this practice. Finally, he succumbed to the demand and accepted an export of those who willing accepted slavery, and for a fee per slave. The Portuguese procured 2,000 to 3,000 slaves per year for a few years, from 1520, a practice that started the slave export history of the Kongo people. However, this supply was far short of the demand for slaves and the money slave owners were willing to pay.\n\nThe Portuguese operators approached the traders at the borders of the Kongo kingdom, such as the Malebo Pool and offered luxury goods in exchange for captured slaves. This created, states Jan Vansina, an incentive for border conflicts and slave caravan routes, from other ethnic groups and different parts of Africa, in which the Kongo people and traders participated. The slave raids and volume of trade in enslaved human beings increased thereafter, and by the 1560s, over 7,000 slaves per year were being captured and exported by Portuguese traders to the Americas. The Kongo people and the neighboring ethnic groups retaliated, with violence and attacks, such as the Jaga invasion of 1568 which swept across the Kongo lands, burnt the Portuguese churches, and attacked its capital, nearly ending the Kingdom of Kongo. The Portuguese brought in military and arms to support the Kingdom of Kongo, and after years of fighting, they jointly defeated the attack. This war unexpectedly led to a flood of captives who had challenged the Kongo nobility and traders, and the coastal ports were flooded with \"war captives turned slaves\". The other effect of this violence over many years was making the Kongo king heavily dependent on the Portuguese protection, along with the dehumanization of the African people, including the rebelling Kongo people, as cannibalistic pagan barbarians from \"Jaga kingdom\". This caricature of the African people and their dehumanization was vociferous and well published by the slave traders, the missionaries and the colonial era Portuguese historians, which helped morally justify mass trading of slaves.\nModern scholars such as Estevam Thompson suggest that the war was a response of the Kongo people and other ethnic groups to the stolen children and broken families from the rising slavery, because there is no evidence that any \"Jaga kingdom\" ever existed, and there is no evidence to support other related claims alleged in the records of that era. The 16th and 17th century one-sided dehumanization of the African people was a fabrication and myth created by the missionaries and slave trading Portuguese to hide their abusive activities and intentions, state Thompson and other scholars.\n\nFrom the 1570s, the European traders arrived in large numbers and the slave trading through the Kongo people territory dramatically increased. The weakened Kingdom of Kongo continued to face internal revolts and violence that resulted from the raids and capture of slaves, and the Portuguese in 1575 established the port city of Luanda (now in Angola) in cooperation with a Kongo noble family to facilitate their military presence, African operations and the slave trade thereof. The Kingdom of Kongo and its people ended their cooperation in the 1660s. In 1665, the Portuguese army invaded the Kingdom, killed the Kongo king, disbanded his army, and installed a friendly replacement in his place.\n\nThe 1665 Kongo-Portuguese war and the killing of the hereditary king by the Portuguese soldiers led to a political vacuum. Kongo kingdom disintegrated into smaller kingdoms, each controlled by nobles considered friendly by the Portuguese. One of these kingdoms was the kingdom of Loango. The Loango was in the northern part, above the Congo river, a region which long before the war was already an established community of the Kongo people. New kingdoms came into existence in this period, from the disintegrated parts in the southeast and the northeast of the old Kongo kingdom. The old capital of Kongo people called Sao Salvador was burnt down, in ruins and abandoned in 1678. The fragmented new kingdoms of Kongo people disputed each other's boundaries and rights, as well as of other non-Kongo ethnic groups bordering them, leading to steady wars and mutual raids.\nThe wars between the small kingdoms created a steady supply of captives that fed the Portuguese demand for slaves and the small kingdom's need for government income to finance the wars. In the 1700s, a baptized teenage Kongo woman named Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita claimed to be possessed by Saint Anthony of Padua and that she has been visiting heaven to speak with God. She started preaching that Mary and Jesus were not born in Nazareth but in Africa among the Kongo people. She created a movement among the Kongo people which historians call as Kongo Antonianism.\n\nDona Beatriz questioned the wars devastating the Kongo people, asked all Kongo people to end the wars that fed the trading in humans, unite under one king. She attracted a following of thousands of Kongo people into the ruins of their old capital. She was declared a false saint by the Portuguese appointed Kongo king Pedro IV, with the support of Portuguese Catholic missionaries and Italian Capuchin monks then resident in Kongo lands. The 22 year old Dona Beatriz was arrested, then burnt alive at the stake on charges of being a witch and a heretic.\n\nAfter the death of Dona Beatriz in 1706 and another three years of wars with the help of the Portuguese, Pedro IV was able to get back much of the old Kongo kingdom. The conflicts continued through the 18th century, however, and the demand for and the caravan of Kongo and non-Kongo people as captured slaves kept rising, headed to the Atlantic ports. Although, in Portuguese documents, all of Kongo people were technically under one ruler, they were no longer governed that way by the mid 18th century. The Kongo people were now divided into regions, each headed by a noble family. Christianity was growing again with new chapels built, services regularly held, missions of different Christian sects expanding, and church rituals a part of the royal succession. There were succession crises, ensuing conflicts when a local royal Kongo ruler died and occasional coups such as that of Andre II by Henrique III, typically settled with Portuguese intervention, and these continued through the mid 19th-century. After Henrique III died in 1857, competitive claims to the throne were raised by his relatives. One of them, Pedro Elelo, gained the trust of Portuguese military against Alvero XIII, by agreeing to be vassal of the colonial Portugal. This effectively ended whatever sovereignty had previously been recognized and the Kongo people became a part of colonial Portugal.\n\nIn concert with the growing import of Christian missionaries and luxury goods, the slave capture and exports through the Kongo lands grew. With over 5.6 million human beings kidnapped in Central Africa, then sold and shipped as slaves through the lands of the Kongo people, they witnessed the largest exports of slaves from Africa into the Americas by 1867. According to Jan Vansina, the \"whole of Angola's economy and its institutions of governance were based on the slave trade\" in 18th and 19th century, until the slave trade was forcibly brought to an end in the 1840s. This ban on lucrative trade of slaves through the lands of Kongo people was bitterly opposed by both the Portuguese and Luso-Africans (part Portuguese, part African), states Vansina. The slave trade was replaced with ivory trade in the 1850s, where the old caravan owners and routes replaced hunting human beings with hunting elephants for their tusks with the help of non-Kongo ethnic groups such as the Chokwe people, which were then exported with the labor of Kongo people.\n\nSwedish missionaries entered the area in the 1880s and 1890, converting the northeast section of Kongo to Protestantism in the early twentieth century. The Swedish missionaries, notably Karl Laman, encouraged the local people to write their history and customs in notebooks, which then became the source for Laman's famous and widely cited ethnography and their dialect became well established thanks to Laman's dictionary of Kikongo.\n\nThe fragmented Kongo people in the 19th century were annexed by three European colonial empires, during the Scramble for Africa and Berlin Conference, the northern most parts went to France (now the Republic of Congo), the middle part along river Congo along with the large inland region of Africa went to Belgium (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and the southern parts remained with Portugal. The Kongo people in all three colonies became one of the most active ethnic groups in the efforts to decolonize Africa, and worked with other ethnic groups in Central Africa to help liberate the three nations to self governance. The French and Belgium regions became independent in 1960. The Angolan independence came after a civil war, in 1975. The Kongo people now occupy influential positions in the politics, administration and business operations in the three countries they are most found in.\n\nThe language of the Kongo people is called Kikongo (Guthrie: Bantu Zone H.10). It is a macrolanguage and consists of Beembe, Doondo, Koongo, Laari, Kongo-San-Salvador, Kunyi, Vili and Yombe sub-languages. It belongs to the Niger-Congo family of languages, more specifically the southern Bantu branch.\n\nThe Kongo language is divided into many dialects which are sufficiently diverse that people from distant dialects, such as speakers of Kivili dialect (on the northern coast) and speakers of Kisansolo (the central dialect) would have trouble understanding each other. Many Bakongo also speak other African languages and European languages. The Vili language, spoken in the northern parts of Kongo people region, was originally grouped as one of the Kongo languages (H.10) by Guthrie, but it is now considered part of the Sira clade of Zone B languages.\n\nIn Angola, there are a few who did not learn to speak Kikongo because Portuguese rules of assimilation during the colonial period was directed against learning native languages, though most Bakongo held on to the language. Most Angolan Kongo also speak Portuguese and those near the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo also speak French. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo most also speak French and others speak either Lingala, a common lingua franca in Western Congo, or Kikongo ya Leta (generally known as Kituba particularly in DR Congo), a creole form of Kikongo spoken widely in the Republic of the Congo, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Angola.\n\nThe religious history of the Kongo is complex, particularly after the ruling class of the Kingdom of Kongo accepted Christianity at the start of the 16th century. According to historian John K. Thornton \"Central Africans have probably never agreed among themselves as to what their cosmology is in detail, a product of what I called the process of continuous revelation and precarious priesthood.\" The Kongo people had diverse views, with traditional religious ideas best developed in the small northern Kikongo-speaking area, and this region neither converted to Christianity nor participated in slave trade until the 19th century.\n\nThere is abundant description about Kongo people's religious ideas in the Christian missionary and colonial era records, but states Thornton, these are written with a hostile bias and their reliability is problematic. The Kongo people's beliefs included \"Kilundu\" as \"Nzambi\" (god) or \"Jinzambi\" (gods, deities), all of which had limited powers. They believed in a creator absolute god, which the 16th-century Christian missionaries to Kongo stressed is same as the Christian God, to help spread their ideas by embracing the old Kongo people's ideas. Similarly, the early missionaries used Kongo language words to integrate Christian ideas, such as using the words \"nkisi\" to mean \"holy\". Thus, states Thornton, church to Kongo people was \"nzo a nkisi\" or another shrine, and the Bible was \"mukanda nkisi\" or a charm. Kongo people maintained both churches and shrines, which they called \"Kiteki\". Their smaller shrines were dedicated to the smaller deities, even after they had converted to Christianity. These deities were guardians of water bodies, crop lands and high places to the Kongo people, and they were very prevalent both in capital towns of the Christian ruling classes, as well as in the villages.\nThe later Portuguese missionaries and Capuchin monks upon their arrival in Kongo were baffled by these practices in the late 17th century (nearly 150 years after the acceptance of Christianity as the state religion in the Kingdom of Kongo). Some threatened to burn or destroy the shrines down. However, the Kongo people credited these shrines for abundance and defended them. The Kongo people's conversion was based on different assumptions and premises about what Christianity was, and syncretic ideas continued for centuries.\n\nThe Kongo people, state the colonial era accounts, included a reverence for their ancestors and spirits. Only Nzambi a Mpungu, the name for the high god, is usually held to have existed outside the world and to have created it. Other categories of the dead include bakulu or ancestors (the souls of the recently departed). In addition, the traditional Kongo belief considered fierce looking \"Nkisi\" as guardians of particular places, such as mountains, river courses, springs and districts, called \"simbi\" (pl. \"bisimbi\").\n\nHowever, some anthropologists report regional differences. According to Dunja Hersak, for example, the Vili and Yombe do not believe in the power of ancestors in the same degree as to those living farther south. Furthermore, she and John Janzen state that religious ideas and emphasis have changed over time.\n\nThe slaves brought over by the European ships into the Americas carried with them their traditional ideas. Vanhee suggests that the Afro-Brazilian Quimbanda religion is a new world manifestation of Bantu religion and spirituality, and Kongo Christianity played a role in the formation of Voudou in Haiti.\n\nThe large Bakongo society features a diversity of occupations. Some are farmers who grow staples and cash crops. Among the staples are cassava, bananas, maize, taro and sweet potatoes. Other crops include peanuts (groundnuts) and beans. The cash crops were introduced by the colonial rulers, and these include coffee and cacao for the chocolate industry. Palm oil is another export commodity, while the traditional urena is a famine food. Some Kongo people fish and hunt, but most work in factories and trade in towns.\n\nThe Kongo people have traditionally recognized their descent from their mother, and this lineage links them into kinship groups. They are culturally organized as ones who cherish their independence, so much so that neighboring Kongo people's villages avoid being dependent on each other. There is a strong undercurrent of messianic tradition among the Bakongo, which has led to several politico-religious movements in the 20th century. This may be linked to the premises of dualistic cosmology in Bakongo tradition, where two world exist, one visible and lived, another invisible and full of powerful spirits. The belief that there is an interaction and reciprocal exchange between these, to Bakongo, means the world of spirits can possess the world of flesh.\n\nThe Kongo week was a four-day week: Konzo, Nkenge, Nsona and Nkandu. These days are named after the four towns near which traditionally a farmer's market was held in rotation. This idea spread across the Kongo people, and every major district or population center had four rotating markets locations, each center named after these days of the week. Larger market gatherings were rotated once every eight days, on Nsona Kungu.\n\nThe idea of a Bakongo unity, actually developed in the early twentieth century, primarily through the publication of newspapers in various dialects of the language. In 1910 Kavuna Kafwandani (Kavuna Simon) published an article in the Swedish mission society's Kikongo language newspaper \"Misanü Miayenge\" (Words of Peace) calling for all speakers of the Kikongo language to recognize their identity.\n\nThe Bakongo people have championed ethnic rivalry and nationalism through sports such as football. The game is organized around ethnic teams, and fans cheer their teams along ethnic lines, such as during matches between the Poto-Poto people and the Kongo people. Further, during international competitions, they join across ethnic lines, states Phyllis Martin, to \"assert their independence against church and state\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2835731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2835731", "title": "La Noche Triste", "text": "La Noche Triste\n\nLa Noche Triste (\"The Night of Sorrows\", literally \"The Sad Night\") on June 30, 1520, was an important event during the Spanish conquest of Mexico, wherein Hernán Cortés and his invading army of Spanish conquistadors and native allies were driven out of the Mexican capital at Tenochtitlan following the death of the Aztec king Moctezuma II, who had been held hostage by the Spaniards.\n\nCortés' expedition arrived at Tenochtitlan, the Mexica capital, on November 8, 1519, taking up residence in a specially designated compound in the city. Soon thereafter, suspecting treachery on the part of their hosts, the Spaniards took Moctezuma II, the king or Hueyi Tlatoani of the Mexica, hostage. Though Moctezuma followed Cortés' instructions in continually assuring his subjects that he had been ordered by the gods to move in with the Spaniards and that he had done so willingly, the Aztecs suspected otherwise. During the following 98 days, Cortés and his native allies, the Tlaxcaltecas, were increasingly unwelcome guests in the capital.\n\nIn June 1520, news from the Gulf coast reached Cortés that a much larger party of Spaniards had been sent by Governor Velázquez of Cuba to arrest Cortés for insubordination. Leaving Tenochtitlan in the care of his trusted lieutenant, Pedro de Alvarado, Cortés marched to the coast, where he defeated the Cuban expedition led by Pánfilo de Narváez sent to capture him. When Cortés told the defeated soldiers about the riches of Tenochtitlan, they agreed to join him. Reinforced by Narvaez's men, Cortés headed back to Tenochtitlan.\n\nDuring Cortés' absence, Pedro de Alvarado in Tenochtitlan obtained information that the Aztecs were planning to attack him. In response, de Alvarado ordered a preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple. In retaliation, the Aztecs laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive. By the time Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, the Aztecs had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named Cuitláhuac.\n\nCortés ordered Moctezuma to address his people from a terrace in order to persuade them to stop fighting and to allow the Spaniards to leave the city in peace. The Aztecs, however, jeered at Moctezuma, and pelted him with stones and darts. By Spanish accounts, he was killed in this assault by the Mexica people, though they claim he had been killed instead by the Spanish.\n\nWith Moctezuma dead, Cortés and Alvarado knew they were in a precarious position. Under constant attack, with gunpowder and food and water in short supply, Cortés decided to break out of the city by night. In order to put the Aztecs off their guard, he sent messengers asking for a one-week ceasefire, at the end of which the Spaniards would return any treasure of which they were in possession and would be permitted to leave the city peacefully.\n\nSince the Aztecs had damaged bridges on four of the eight causeways into the island city, the Spaniards devised a portable bridge they could use in order to cross any unspanned sections of water. Cortés ordered that as much of the accumulated gold and other booty as was feasible be packed and carried away, and invited the Spanish soldiers to take and carry away as much as they wished of the remainder. This invitation would lead to the demise of many soldiers who, overburdened with treasure, found it impossible to navigate the causeways and other obstacles encountered on the way out of the city.\n\nOn the night of July 1st, 1520, his large army left their compound and headed west, toward the Tlacopan causeway. The causeway was apparently unguarded, and the Spaniards made their way out of their complex unnoticed, winding their way through the sleeping city under the cover of a rainstorm. Before reaching the causeway, they were noticed by Aztec warriors known as the Eagle Warriors, who sounded the alarm. First by a woman drawing water, and then by the priest of Huitzilopochtli from atop Templo Mayor.\n\nThe fighting was ferocious. As the Spaniards and their native allies reached the causeway, hundreds of canoes appeared in the waters alongside to harry them. The Spaniards fought their way across the causeway in the rain. Weighed down by gold and equipment, some of the soldiers lost their footing, fell into the lake, and drowned. Amid a vanguard of horsemen, Cortés pressed ahead and reached dry land at Tacuba, leaving the rest of the expedition to fend for itself in the treacherous crossing.\n\nSeeing the wounded survivors straggle into the village, Cortés and his horsemen turned back to the causeway, where they encountered Pedro de Alvarado, unhorsed and badly wounded, in the company of a handful of Spaniards and Tlaxcaltecas. According to Bernal Díaz del Castillo, it was at this point that tears came to Cortés' eyes, as he realized the extent of the debacle.\n\nCortés, Alvarado and the strongest and most skilled of the men had managed to fight their way out of Tenochtitlan, although they were all bloodied and exhausted. Cortés himself had been injured in the fighting. All of the artillery had been lost, as had most of the horses.\n\nThe sources are not in agreement as to the total number of casualties suffered by the expedition. Cortés himself claimed that 154 Spaniards were lost along with over 2,000 native allies. Thoan Cano, another eyewitness to the event, said that 1170 Spaniards died, but this number probably exceeds the total number of Spaniards who took part in the expedition. Francisco López de Gómara, who was not himself an eyewitness, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies died.\n\nMontezuma's son, Chimalpopoca (Moctezuma) was killed and the Tepanec prince Tlaltecatzin. King Cacamatzin, his three sisters and two brothers were also killed.\n\nDiaz states the Spaniards suffered 860 soldiers killed, which included those from the later Battle of Otumba. The Tlaxcaltecas lost a thousand. The noncombatants attached to the expedition suffered terribly, 72 casualties, including five Spanish women. The few women who survived included La Malinche the interpreter, Dona Luisa, and María Estrada. The event was named La Noche Triste (\"The Night of Sorrows\") on account of the sorrow that Cortés and his surviving followers felt and expressed at the loss of life and treasure incurred in the escape from Tenochtitlan.\n\nFurther battles awaited the Spaniards and their allies as they fought their way around the north end of Lake Zumpango. Two weeks later, at the Battle of Otumba, not far from Teotihuacan, they turned to fight the pursuing Aztec, decisively defeating them — according to Cortés, because he slew the Aztec commander — and giving the Spaniards a small respite that allowed them to reach Tlaxcala.\n\nIt was there in Tlaxcala that Cortés plotted the siege of Tenochtitlan and the eventual destruction of the Aztec Empire.\n\n\n\n\n"}

While there was normally several maids of honour (Danish: \"Hoffrøken\"; German: \"Hoffräulein\"; Swedish: \"Hovfröken\"), there was normally only one Maid of the Bedchamber. She was in rank between the maids of honour and the married ladies-in-waiting. As the German court model originally included only a Chief Court Mistress and a group of maids of honours, she was often second in rank of the ladies-in-waiting between them. The Maid of the Bedchamber was an office of high status selected from nobility. She had often been a maid of honour before she was promoted, because of birth or royal favor. Her tasks were essentially the same as the tasks of the maids of honour, though they were of higher status. In Sweden, the \"kammarfröken\" was the deputy of the \"överhovmästarinna\" whenever she was absent until the introduction of the office \"statsfru\" in 1774. As the maids of honour, a Maid of the Bedchamber retired from her office upon marriage. \n\n"}
{"id": "11003197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11003197", "title": "Marriage gap", "text": "Marriage gap\n\nThe marriage gap describes observed economic and political disparities in the United States between those who are married and those who are single. The marriage gap can be compared to, but should not be confused with, the gender gap. As noted by Dr. W. Bradford Wilcox, American sociologist and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, and Wendy Wang, director of research at the Institute for Family Studies, \"College-educated and more affluent Americans enjoy relatively strong and stable marriages and the economic and social benefits that flow from such marriages. By contrast, not just poor but also working-class Americans face rising rates of family instability, single parenthood, and lifelong singleness.\"\n\nAs part of the marriage gap, unmarried people are \"considerably more liberal\" than married people. With little variation between professed moderates, married people respond to be conservative 9 percent more, and single people respond to be liberal 10 percent more.\nMarried people tend to hold political opinions that differ from those of people who have never married.\n\nIn the U.S., being a married woman is correlated with a higher level of support for the Republican Party, and being single with the Democratic Party. Marriage does not seem to have a strong affect on party affiliation: 32 percent of married people call themselves Republicans and 31 percent say they are Democrats, while among single people, 19 percent are Republicans and 38 percent Democrats. The difference is most striking between married and single women. Married women respond as being Republicans 15 percent more; single women respond as being Democrats 11 percent more.\n\nThe marriage gap is evident on a range of political issues in the United States:\n\nIt is not clear that legally or religiously formalized marriages are associated with better outcomes than long-term cohabitation. Part of the issue is that in many western countries, married couples will have cohabited before marrying, so that the stability of the resulting marriage might be attributable to the cohabitation having worked.\n\nA chief executive of an organisation that studies relationships is quoted for having said:\n\"Because we now have the acceptance of long-term cohabitation, people who go into marriage and stay in marriage are a more homogenous group. They are people who believe in certain things that contribute to stability. So the selection effect is really important. Yes, it's true that married couples on average stay together longer than cohabiting couples. But cohabitation is such an unhelpful word, because it covers a whole ragbag of relationships, so it's not really comparable. We're better off talking about formal and informal marriages: those that have legal certificates, and those that don't. Is there any difference between a formal and informal marriage? If we really compare like with like, I'm not sure you'd see much difference.\" – Penny Mansfield\n\nAmerican marriage and family life is divided more today than it ever has been. \"Less than half of poor Americans age 18 to 55 ( just 26 percent) and 39 percent of working-class Americans are currently married, compared to more than half (56 percent) of middle- and upper-class Americans.\" (cite) And when it comes to coupling, poor and working-class Americans are more likely to substitute cohabitation for marriage: poor Americans are almost three times more likely to cohabit (13%), and working-class Americans are twice as likely to cohabit (10%), compared with their middle- and upper-class peers age 18–55 (5%). These findings suggest that lower income and less-educated Americans are more likely to be living outside of a partnership. Specifically, about six in 10 poor Americans are single, about five in 10 working-class Americans are single, and about four in 10 middle- and upper-class Americans are single.\n\nAnd when it comes to childbearing, working-class and especially poor women are more likely to have children than their middle- and upper-class peers, and these children of poor women have a significant higher chance of being born out of wedlock. Estimates derived from the 2013–15 National Survey of Family Growth indicate that poor women currently have about 2.4 children, compared with 1.8 children for working-class women and 1.7 children for middle- and upper-class women. According to the 2015 American Community Survey, 64 percent of children born to poor women are born out of wedlock, compared with 36 percent of children born to working class women, and 13 percent of children born to middle- and upper-class children.\n\nWith respect to divorce, working-class and poor adults age 18-55 are more likely to divorce than are their middle- and upper-class counterparts. 46 percent of poor Americans aged 18-55 are divorced, compared with 41% of working-class adults and 30 percent of middle- and upper-class adults.\n\nThe marriage gap is susceptible to multiple interpretations because it is not clear to what extent it is attributable to causation and what to correlation. It may be that people who already have a number of positive indicators of future wellbeing in terms of wealth and education are more likely to get married. \"The distinction between correlation and causation cuts to the heart of the debate about marriage. The evidence is unequivocal; children raised by married couples are healthier, do better at school, commit fewer crimes, go further in education, report higher levels of wellbeing. It is easy for politicians to deduce - and assert - that married couples therefore produce superior children. But the children do not necessarily do better because their parents are married and there is actually very little evidence that marriage alone, in the absence of anything else, benefits children.\" – Penny Mansfield\n\nAs noted by W. Bradford Wilcox and Wendy Wang,A series of interlocking economic, policy, civic, and cultural changes since the 1960s in America combined to create a perfect family storm for poor and working-class Americans.12 On the economic front, the move to a postindustrial economy in the 1970s made it more difficult for poor and working-class men to find and hold stable, decent-paying jobs.13 See, for example, the increase in unemployment for less-educated but not college-educated men depicted in Figure 9.14 The losses that less-educated men have experienced since the 1970s in job stability and real income have rendered them less “marriageable,” that is, less attractive as husbands—and more vulnerable to divorce.Wilcox and Wang continue, however, and contend that it is not only economics. Citing Cornell sociologist Daniel Lichter and colleagues, they note that \"shifts in state-level employment trends and macroeconomic performance do not explain the majority of the decline of marriage in this period; indeed, the retreat from marriage continued in the 1990s even as the economy boomed across much of the country in this decade.\" In the words of Lichter in colleagues, \"“Our results call into question the appropriateness of monocausal economic explanations of declining marriage.\" In fact, \"The decline of marriage and rise of single parenthood in the late 1960s preceded the economic changes that undercut men’s wages and job stability in the 1970s.\"\n\nThere exist several possible reasons for the emergence of the Marriage Divide. First, as posited by W. Bradford Wilcox, Wendy Wang, and Nicholas Wolfinger, \"because working-class and poor Americans have less of a social and economic stake in stable marriage, they depend more on cultural supports for marriage than do their middle- and upper-class peers.\"\n\nSecond, \"Working-class and poor Americans have fewer cultural and educational resources to successfully navigate the increasingly deinstitutionalized character of dating, childbearing, and marriage. The legal scholar Amy Wax argues that the “moral deregulation” of matters related to sex, parenthood, marriage, and divorce proved more difficult for poor and working-class Americans to navigate than for more educated and affluent Americans because the latter group was and remains more likely to approach these matters with a disciplined, long-term perspective.\" \"Today’s ethos of freedom and choice when it comes to dating, childbearing, and marriage is more difficult for working-class and poor Americans to navigate.\"\n\nThird, \"in recent years, middle- and upper-class Americans have rejected the most permissive dimensions of the counterculture for themselves and their children, even as poor and working-class Americans have adapted a more permissive orientation toward matters such as divorce and premarital sex. The end result has been that key norms, values, and virtues— from fidelity to attitudes about teen pregnancy—that sustain a strong marriage culture are now generally weaker in poor and working-class communities.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24084236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24084236", "title": "Multiculturalism in the Netherlands", "text": "Multiculturalism in the Netherlands\n\nMulticulturalism in the Netherlands began with a major increases in immigration during the 1950s and 1960s. As a consequence, an official national policy of multiculturalism was adopted in the early 1980s. This policy subsequently gave way to more assimilationist policies in the 1990s. Following the murders of Pim Fortuyn (in 2002) and Theo van Gogh (in 2004) the political debate on the role of multiculturalism in the Netherlands reached new heights.\n\nLord Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, distinguishes between tolerance and multiculturalism, and says that the Netherlands is a tolerant, rather than multicultural, society.\n\nAfter the Second World War, immigration consisted of guest workers and migrants from the former colonies. There was low pressure to culturally assimilate, it was easy to gain citizenship and government agencies translated documents and services for immigrants who lacked Dutch language skills. Until the 1970s it was generally assumed that immigrants, especially guest workers, would eventually return to their countries of origin.\n\nMulticulturalism was adopted as a government policy by the Netherlands in the early 1980s, largely from a conviction that a quick assimilation of Muslim immigrants was impossible, and to stimulate remigration. In 1983 an \"Ethnic Minorities Policy\" was adopted.\n\nThe Second Oil Crisis led to a collapse of Dutch industrial labour and caused massive unemployment for the former \"guest workers\", who were not easily integrated into the newly developing postindustrial society. Dutch low-skilled labour as a fraction of the total workforce declined from 18% to 2% between 1979 and 1985, disproportionally affecting immigrants. State programs to rectify the situation were ineffective during the 1980s. The economic boom of the 1990s improved the situation. The unemployment rate of Moroccans, the most disadvantaged large immigrant group, declined from 50% to 10% between 1989 and 2001. In the post-1998 period government policies have become stricter and while previous integration policies furthered diversity, diversity now was perceived to obstruct integration into Dutch society.\n\nThe Netherlands has attracted international attention for the extent to which it reversed its previous multiculturalist policies, and its policies on cultural assimilation have been described as the toughest in Europe.\n\nAfter the Second World War there were three successive waves of major immigration into the Netherlands. The first originated in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) in the 1940s and 1950s. The second wave originated in Southern Europe (Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) and from Turkey and Morocco during the 1960s and 1970s, coinciding with a wave from the Dutch colony of Suriname. The second wave was largely in the form of labour migration of workers recruited by the Dutch state, a policy ended in 1974. The third wave consisted of asylum seekers from different countries such as Iran, Iraq, and former Yugoslavia since the mid-1990s. The waves should be discerned from a general high and rising 'background' level of labour immigration from European countries, that accounts for the majority of people settling in the Netherlands.\n\nThe anti-immigration Centrumpartij had a limited electoral success since 1982, but its leader Hans Janmaat was ostracized, and fined for his discriminatory statements and promotion of ethnic cleansing.\n\nBy 2007, nearly 20% of the country's population were either (western and non-western) immigrants or children of immigrant parents.\n\nThe multicultural policy consensus down-played negative aspects of the presence of immigrant cultural communities, and stressed beneficial effects. Immigration was not subject to limits on cultural grounds: in practice, the immigration rate was determined by demand for unskilled labour, and later by migration of family members. The total Western and non-Western immigration and re-migration resulted in an immigrant population of about 3.5 million. In 2014, about two million inhabitants were non-Western immigrants (1,095,731) or the direct descendants of these. Net immigration and the initially higher birth rate of the immigrant communities, have transformed the Dutch population structure since the 1950s. In 2006 one fifth of the population was of non-Dutch ethnicity, about half of which were of non-Western origin. Immigration transformed Dutch cities especially: in Amsterdam, 55% of young people are of non-Western origin (mainly Moroccan, Surinamese and Turkish).\n\nIn 1999, the legal philosopher Paul Cliteur attacked multiculturalism in his book \"The Philosophy of Human Rights\". Cliteur rejects all political correctness on the issue: Western culture, the \"Rechtsstaat\" (rule of law), and human rights are superior to non-Western culture and values. They are the product of the Enlightenment. Cliteur sees non-Western cultures not as merely different but as anachronistic. He sees multiculturalism primarily as an unacceptable ideology of cultural relativism, which would lead to acceptance of barbaric practices, including those brought to the Western World by immigrants. Cliteur lists infanticide, torture, slavery, oppression of women, homophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, gangs, female genital cutting, discrimination \"by\" immigrants, suttee, and the death penalty. Cliteur compares multiculturalism to the moral acceptance of Auschwitz, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot and the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nCliteur's 1999 work is indicative of the polemic tone of the debate in the following years. Most of the \"immigrant barbarities\" which he names are regularly cited by opponents of multiculturalism, sometimes as a \"reductio ad absurdum\", but also as supposed factual practices of immigrants in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2000, Paul Scheffer — a member of the Labour Party and subsequently a professor of urban studies — published his essay \"The multicultural tragedy\", an essay critical of both immigration and multiculturalism. Scheffer is a committed supporter of the nation-state, assuming that homogeneity and integration are necessary for a society: the presence of immigrants undermines this. A society does have a finite \"absorptive capacity\" for those from other cultures, he says, but this has been exceeded in the Netherlands. His position more specifically included the following points:\n\nScheffer approvingly quoted the Dutch sociologist J.A.A. van Doorn as saying that the presence of immigrants in the Netherlands had \"put the evolutionary clock back\" by fifty years or more. The high immigration rate and the lack of integration threatened society, and must be stopped. His essay had a great impact, and led to what became known as the \"integration debate\". As in the essay, this was not simply about multiculturalism, but about immigration, Islam, the national identity, and national unity.\n\nIn 2002, the legal scholar Afshin Ellian, a refugee from Iran, advocated a monocultural \"Rechtsstaat\" in the Netherlands. A liberal democracy cannot be multicultural, he argued, because multiculturalism is an ideology and a democracy has no official ideology. What is more, according to Ellian, a democracy must be monolingual. The Dutch language is the language of the constitution, and therefore it must be the only public language — all others must be limited to the private sphere. The Netherlands, he wrote, had been taken hostage by the left-wing multiculturalists, and their policy was in turn determined by the Islamic conservatives. Ellian stated that there were 800 000 Muslims in the country, with 450 mosques, and that the Netherlands had legalised the \"feudal system of the Islamic Empire\". Democracy and the rule of law could only be restored by abolishing multiculturalism.\n\nOverturning the political stability of the 1990s, Fortuyn in early 2002 swiftly gained popularity. He was assassinated during the 2002 Dutch national election campaign by a militant animal rights activist Volkert van der Graaf, who claimed in court to murdering Fortuyn to stop him exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" and targeting \"the weak parts of society to score points\" in seeking political power. His supporters saw Fortuyn as a national martyr in the struggle against islamisation.\n\nFollowing Fortuyn's death, open rejection of multiculturalism and immigration ceased to be taboo. The new cabinet, under premier Jan-Peter Balkenende instituted a hard-line assimilation policy, enforced by fines and deportation, accompanied by far tighter controls on immigration and asylum. Many former supporters of multiculturalism shifted their position. In a 2006 manifesto \"one country, one society\", several of them launched an appeal for a more cohesive society by \"unity in diversity\", while deploring what they saw as increasing intolerance. Piet Hein Donner, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations in the Rutte cabinet, said that \"Dutch culture, norms and values must be dominant\".\n\nThe most prominent figure in the post-Fortuyn debate of the issue was Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Her first criticisms of multiculturalism paralleled those of the early liberal-feminist critics in the United States — the emphasis on group identity and group rights diminished individual liberty for those within the minorities, and especially for women. As time went on, her criticism was increasingly directed at Islam itself, and its incompatibility with democracy and Western culture. By 2004 she was the most prominent critic of Islam in Europe. She scripted a short film on Islamic oppression of women, featuring texts from the Quran on the naked bodies of women; its director Theo van Gogh was later assassinated by Mohammed Bouyeri. Threatened with death and heavily guarded, she spent most of her time in the United States, and moved to Washington in 2006 to work for the American Enterprise Institute. In 2006, she also expressed support for the Eurabia thesis — that mainstream politicians are conspiring to fully Islamise Europe —, and that its non-Muslim inhabitants will be reduced to dhimmitude. In a speech for CORE in January 2007, she declared that Western culture was overwhelmingly superior:\n\nSome of the measures, especially those seeking to promote patriotic identification, include: In the Netherlands, the naturalisation ceremony includes a gift symbolising national unity. In Gouda it is a candle in the national colours red-white-blue, in Amsterdam a Delftware potato with floral motifs.\n\nThere are proposed measures which go much further than these. They typically, but not always, come from firmly right-wing parties and their supporters. The proposals illustrate the \"post-multicultural\" climate: a loyalty oath for all citizens, legal prohibition of public use of a foreign language, cessation of all immigration, expulsion of criminal, unemployed or not integrated immigrants, withdrawal from the European Union, a compulsory (non-military) national service; a ban on the construction of mosques, closure of all Islamic schools, a closure of all mosques, or a complete ban on Islam.\n\nThe Party for Freedom of anti-immigration politician Geert Wilders opposed the nomination of two ministers because they had dual nationality. The party subsequently proposed a motion of no confidence in both ministers. The party doubts their loyalty to the Netherlands, in cases of conflict with their countries of origin (Turkey and Morocco). According to an opinion poll more than half the population agrees with the party. Opinion is sharply divided by political party: 96% of Wilders' voters agree with him, and 93% of GreenLeft voters disagree.\n\nAlthough such policies often have the stated aim of reviving national unity, one result has been an increased polarization. Muslims in Britain or the Netherlands hear that their culture is backward, that Western culture is superior, and that they are obliged to adopt it. In turn, defensive reactions include an increased self-identification as \"Muslims\", and adoption of Islamic dress by women and \"Islamic\" beards by men. Part of the Muslim minority is now hostile to the society they live in, and sympathetic to terrorism.\nIn Amsterdam's secondary schools, about half of the Moroccan minority does not identify with the Netherlands: they see their identity as \"Muslim\", and regularly express anti-Western views.\n\nNew terms for minorities of immigrant descent have come into use: the term allochtoon in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium) and the Netherlands. Both are applied regardless of citizenship. The renewed emphasis on historical culture places higher demands on cultural assimilation; immigrants may be encouraged to learn, for example, to identify and describe cultural heroes and historical figures such as Thorbecke and\nWilliam of Orange.\n\n"}

{"id": "1393650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1393650", "title": "Pericúes", "text": "Pericúes\n\nThe Pericú (also known as Pericues, Cora, Edues) were the aboriginal inhabitants of the Cape Region, the southernmost portion of Baja California Sur, Mexico. They have been linguistically and culturally extinct since the late 18th century.\n\nThe southern edge of the Baja California Peninsula, from Cabo San Lucas east to Cabo Pulmo, together with the large Gulf of California Islands of Cerralvo, Espíritu Santo, La Partida, and San José, have been recognized as aboriginal Pericú territory. William C. Massey (1949) thought that the eastern portion of the Cape Region, including Bahía las Palmas and Bahía Ventana, was occupied by a Guaycura group known as the Cora. Subsequent reexamination of the ethnohistoric evidence suggests that Cora was synonymous with Pericú (Laylander 1997).\n\nThe status of the La Paz area is uncertain. Massey assigned it to two Guaycura groups, the Cora and the Aripe. W. Michael Mathes (1975) argued that it had belonged to the Pericú in the 16th and 17th centuries but was taken over by the Guaycura some time between 1668 and 1720. An alternative interpretation is that it was disputed ground between the Pericú and Guaycura throughout the early historic period.\n\nEvidence concerning the language spoken by the Pericú is limited to a handful of words plus fewer than a dozen place names (León-Portilla 1976). Jesuit missionaries recognized Pericú as a language distinct from Guaycura. Massey (1949) suggested that Pericú and Guaycura had together constituted a Guaycuran language family, but this seems to have been based purely on their geographic proximity.\n\nThe archaeological record for Pericú territory extends at least as far back as the early Holocene, about 10,000 years ago, and perhaps into the late Pleistocene (Fujita 2006). The distinctive hyperdolichocephalic (long-headed) skulls found in Cape Region burials have suggested to some scholars that the ancestors of the Pericú were either trans-Pacific immigrants or remnants of some of the New World's earliest colonizers (González-José et al. 2003; Rivet 1909). The distinctive Las Palmas burial complex, involving secondary burials painted with red ochre and deposited in caves or rockshelters, was particularly noted (Massey 1955). The continued use of the atlatl and dart alongside the bow and arrow as late as the 17th century, long after their replacement in most of North America, has been used to argue for an exceptional degree of isolation in southern Baja California (Massey 1961).\n\nHarumi Fujita (2006) has traced the changing patterns in the exploitation of marine resources and in settlement within the prehistoric Cape Region. According to Fujita, after about AD 1000, four major centers of socioeconomic and ceremonial importance emerged in the Cape Region: near Cabo San Lucas, at Cabo Pulmo, at La Paz, and on Isla Espíritu Santo.\n\nEuropean contacts with the Pericú began in the 1530s, first when Fortún Ximénez and mutineers from an expedition sent out by Hernán Cortés, the conqueror of central Mexico, reached La Paz, followed shortly afterwards by an expedition under Cortés himself (Mathes 1973). Sporadic encounters, sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile, linked the Pericú with a succession of European explorers, privateers, missionaries, Manila galleons, and pearl hunters throughout the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries. \nThe Jesuits established their first permanent mission in Baja California at Loreto in 1697, but it was more than two decades later that they felt prepared to move into the Cape Region. Missions serving the Pericú, at least in part, were established at La Paz (1720), Santiago (1724), and San José del Cabo (1730). A dramatic reversal came in 1734 when the Pericú Revolt began, resulting in the most serious challenge the Jesuits experienced in Baja California. Two missionaries were killed, and for two years Jesuit control over the Cape Region was interrupted (Taraval 1931). The Pericú themselves suffered most, however, with combat deaths added to the already devastating effects of Old World diseases. By the time the Spanish crown expelled the Jesuits from Baja California in 1768, the Pericú seem to have been culturally extinct, although some of their genes may survive in local populations of mixed descent.\n\nThe Pericú are known primarily through the accounts of early European visitors (Laylander 2000; Mathes 2006). The most detailed of these were left by English privateers who spent time at Cabo San Lucas in 1709-1710 and 1721 (Andrews 1979).\n\nThe Pericú are best known for their maritime orientation, harvesting fish, shellfish, and marine mammals from the waters of the southern Gulf of California. Terrestrial resources such as agave, the fruit of cacti, small game, and deer were also important. Agriculture was not practiced.\n\nThe Pericú were one of the few aboriginal groups on the California coasts to possess watercraft other than tule balsas, making use of wooden rafts and double-bladed paddles. Nets, spears or harpoons, darts, and bows and arrows were tools for procuring fish and meat. Bags, baskets, and gourds were used for carrying, since pottery was not made. The requirements for shelter and clothing were minimal, although the women wore skirts of fiber or animal skins and both sexes adopted various forms of adornment.\n\nThe division of labor among the Pericú was evidently based primarily or exclusively on sex and age. They were variously reported as being either monogamous or polygamous. Communities seem to have been politically independent. Leadership positions were hereditary and were sometimes held by women. Inter-community and inter-ethnic warfare seems to have been frequent, and conflicts with the Guaycura were chronic.\n\nFragments of Pericú mythology were recorded in the early 1730s (Venegas 1979(4):524-525). Shamans claimed to be able to effect supernatural cures of the sick. Mortuary and mourning observances were particularly elaborate.\n\nThe people believed in an all-powerful master named Niparaya, creator of heaven and earth. His wife is Amayicoyondi and they had three sons. One is called Quaayayp, who created the race of men. He was later killed by them. The second was Acaragui. The third was called Wac or Tuparan, depending on the sect. \n\n\n"}

Operating a brothel is also legal. De Wallen, the largest and best-known Red-light district in Amsterdam, is a destination for international sex tourism.\n\nAs with other countries, estimates regarding the total number of prostitutes vary. Most sources place this number between 15,000 and 30,000.\n\nAn article published in 1997 in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality claimed that the total number of prostitutes in the Netherlands was about 15,000 to 20,000.\n\nA later study by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2000 estimated that there were a total of between 20,000 and 25,000 prostitutes in the Netherlands. UNAIDS estimated to number to be 25,000 in 2016.\n\nAround 90% of sex workers are estimated to be female, 5% male and 5% transgender.\n\nIn the 1970s, the majority of foreign prostitutes were from Thailand, in the 1980s from Latin America and the Caribbean. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, many prostitutes came from Central and Eastern Europe. No more than one third were Dutch nationals, the remainder representing 44 nationalities. The majority were from the Dominican Republic, Colombia, the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nAn article written by Marie-Victoire Louis in \"Le Monde diplomatique\" in 1997, claimed that 80% of prostitutes in Amsterdam were foreigners and 70% had no immigration papers (but did not quote the source). \n\nIn 2008, Karina Schaapman, a former prostitute and former member of the Amsterdam city council, produced a report about the Amsterdam sex trade. She offered the police a Facebook with 80 \"violent pimps\", of whom only three were Dutch-born. She said that more than 75% of Amsterdam's 8,000 to 11,000 prostitutes were from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.\n\nA study released by TAMPEP in 2009 put the number of migrant prostitutes at 60% (a decrease from 70% in 2006), originating from: Central Europe (EU) 40%, Latin America 20%, Western Europe 12%, Eastern Europe (non-EU) 8%, Africa 8%, Balkans 4%, Asia 4%, Baltic states 3% (estimates for 2008).\n\nAccording to the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality, during the 1990s, some 10% of prostitutes worked on the streets, 30% in window prostitution, 30% in sex clubs, 15% in an escort service, and 15% in their private residence. Drug addicts, including drug tourists, were said to be numerous in the street prostitution group. Window and club prostitution were dominated by Caribbean, South-American, African, and Asian women.\n\nAccording to Radio Netherlands, prostitution is concentrated in and around the big cities and in the border towns in the regions of Limburg, Groningen, Twente, West Brabant and Zeeland. Prostitution occurs in various forms: window and street prostitution, clubs, escort agencies and home-based prostitution. Window prostitution occurs in 12 cities in the Netherlands. It is estimated that on average some 2,000 prostitutes are engaged daily in this form of prostitution. Street prostitution exists in 10 Dutch cities and involves on average some 320 prostitutes daily. Between 3,500 and 4,000 prostitutes are employed daily in 600–700 clubs and private brothels. The extent of other forms of prostitution such as escort agencies and home-based prostitution is much more difficult to estimate. Home-based prostitution occurs in at least 17 municipalities and escort agencies exist in at least 28 municipalities.\n\nIn 2008, city statistic showed 142 licensed brothels in Amsterdam, with about 500 window displays, and officials estimated that sexual transactions in Amsterdam account for about 100 million US dollars per year.\n\nTen percent of all prostitutes were estimated to be drug addicts (in the late 90s) the majority of these prostitutes being Dutch nationals or former Dutch nationals. Most prostitution consists in females selling sex to males. About 5% of prostitutes were estimated to be males and 5% were transgender.\n\nIn 2011 Dutch authorities started asking sex workers to pay taxes on their earnings. \n\nSome Dutch cities provide facilities called \"afwerkplek\", a sex drive-in enclosure for cars for street prostitution.\n\nIn a 1989 study 13.5% of men reported having paid for sex at least once in their life and 2.6% had done so during the past year.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, prostitution was tolerated. The attitude of worldly and religious authorities towards prostitution was pragmatic. Many cities tolerated prostitution to protect chaste female citizens from rape and defilement. There were, however, a number of conditions imposed on prostitutes and their clients. Prostitutes were not allowed to be married.\n\nStill, prostitution was considered a dishonorable profession. Prostitutes were not expected to conform to sexual rules, and were not protected by the law. The concept of \"honor\" was very important in early modern Dutch society. Honor had social significance, but it also had legal ramifications. \"Honorable\" people had more rights. Until the late sixteenth century honor, aside from citizenship, was the most important criterion for the stratification of society.\n\nDespite the fact that prostitution was seen as indispensable, city governments tried to separate \"dishonorable\" prostitution from the honorable world. Until the fifteenth century, Dutch cities tried to keep prostitution outside of the city walls. Later, city governments tried to reserve certain areas of the city for prostitution. Prostitution businesses were driven to the streets and alleys near the city walls.\n\nTypical is the following decree from the city of Amsterdam in 1413:\n\nDuring the sixteenth century, attitudes about sexuality changed under the influence of the Spanish occupation and rising Protestantism. Sexual activities were only tolerated within marriage. Church and state were not separated, and what was defined by the church as a sin was defined as a crime by the government. Prostitution and procurement were viewed as a sin and therefore prohibited. However, during this century the city of Amsterdam started to regulate prostitution. Only the police and the bailiff and his servants could keep a brothel in the Pijl and Halsteeg (currently the Damstraat). Prostitutes who practiced their trade in other parts of the city were arrested and their clients fined. Prostitution was a lucrative trade for the bailiff's servants as well as for the city treasury. In 1578, the city of Amsterdam left the Spanish side during the Netherlands uprising and converted from Catholicism to Calvinism. The city then stopped regulating prostitution.\n\nCalvinistic morals were mirrored in the government policies of the seventeenth century. Titillating activities like dancing, fairs and prostitution were sometimes outlawed. This morality did not, however, always correspond with the views and customs of the people. During the Golden seventeenth century sexuality was openly displayed in paintings and in literature. The image of the prostitute in literature was very negative. Prostitutes were portrayed as unreliable, impudent, lazy, and often ugly and dirty. In paintings, the image of the prostitute was more positive. Brothel-scenes were an important subject and prostitutes were painted as beautiful young women. The clients, however, were portrayed as fools who allowed themselves to be deceived. In both literature and paintings the madams were portrayed as evil profiteers. The authorities could not uphold the laws against prostitution and tended to leave brothels alone if they did not cause trouble.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century the morals preached by the church and government became more in line with certain developments within Dutch society. There was a growing middle class which tried to distinguish itself by a strong work ethic and self-control. By restrained sexual behavior, the middle class could separate itself from the 'loose' lower class as well as the indecent nobility. Rich and poor also began to separate geographically. Prior to this period different social classes lived side by side, but they now lived in separate neighborhoods. The image of women also changed. Bourgeois women were seen by men of their class as faithful and chaste, but working-class women were viewed by middle class men as potential prostitutes.\n\nThe working conditions of prostitutes were very poor. There was no proper birth control, condoms were not widely available and there were no effective cures against venereal diseases. Prostitutes often became pregnant and, because of venereal diseases they eventually became infertile. This situation would not improve before the twentieth century.\n\nProstitutes allowed very little sexual variation. The only sexual positions which were tolerated were the missionary position and standing upright, face to face. Anal sex, kissing, and oral sex were strictly taboo.\n\nIn the beginning of the nineteenth century the armies of Napoleon started to regulate prostitution in the Netherlands (in 1810) to protect soldiers against venereal diseases. Prostitutes were forced to register and were subjected to mandatory medical examinations. Registered prostitutes were handed a red card which was a sort of work permit. If they were found to be infected, their red card was taken and they were given a white card instead while they were prohibited from working and were only allowed to work when declared fit. After the French occupation the Dutch government stopped regulating prostitution, but during several decades slowly began to regulate prostitutes again in the same style as under the French occupation. Many scientists during the nineteenth century believed that sexual abstinence for men was unhealthy. In their eyes it was unavoidable that a number of women had to sacrifice themselves to protect the rest of the women from destruction of an even more revolting kind. The women who had to sacrifice themselves were supposed to be lower class. Prostitutes themselves, however, were still despised and portrayed as disgusting creatures. Lower-class people themselves detested prostitutes. Prostitutes stood outside society.\n\nDuring the 19th century, sexual morals became stricter, and a counter movement arose against regulated prostitution. In the beginning, this movement consisted of wealthy orthodox-Protestant Christians, but it later got support from other movements like Catholics, socialists, feminists and progressive liberals. They attacked the idea that men could not abstain from sex. Clients were viewed as low, dirty lechers, and the clients were not the young unmarried men prostitution was meant for, but were often well-off middle-aged married men. They also attacked the mandatory medical examinations, which were deemed degrading and ineffective to stop the spread of venereal diseases. Many prostitutes lived in the brothels and were bound to the madams by debts to pay off expensive working clothes. Prostitutes were often sold among madams, were subjected to fines, and could only leave the brothel under supervision. Medical expenses were added to their debt. Brothel keepers throughout Europe sold women among each other. The abolitionist movement in the Netherlands was largely connected to the international abolitionist movement. The movement slowly gained more influence, and during the last decades of the nineteenth century city governments slowly started to abolish regulated prostitution. At first, the abolitionist movement mainly targeted mandatory health checks for prostitutes, but when the movement became more successful the focus shifted towards the people who profited from prostitution. In 1911 living on the avails of prostitution and owning a brothel were prohibited by law. Prostitution itself was not prohibited.\n\nUntil the 1970s, prostitutes in the Netherlands were predominantly white lower-class women from the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Northern Germany. During the 1970s, in the wake of the sex trips to South-East Asia by Dutch men, the sex operators brought in women from Thailand and the Philippines. In the 1980s there was a second wave from Latin America and Africa. In the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, women came from Eastern Europe. Foreign prostitutes are economically motivated to come to the Netherlands, and they tend to travel to engage in sex work between the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and other European societies.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, prostitution and brothels were condoned and tolerated by many local governments. The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this \"gedoogbeleid\" (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands. (See drug policy of the Netherlands.)\n\nThe Red Thread (\"de Rode Draad\") is a support and advocacy association for prostitutes that was founded in 1985 and works for the legitimization and against the stigmatization of prostitutes.\n\nProstitution was defined as a legal profession in January 1988.\n\nBrothel prohibition made it difficult to set rules for the sex industry. During the eighties many municipalities urged the national government to lift the ban on brothels. In 1983 minister Korthals Altes had presented an amendment to the law on prostitution. It took until 1 October 2000 for brothels to leave the half-legal status of being tolerated and to become fully legal and licensed businesses. Prostitutes may work as regular employees, though the vast majority work as independent contractors. The Dutch union FNV has accepted prostitutes as members since that time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an \"acceptable job\", and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178).\n\nWhen the Dutch government legalized prostitution in 2000, it was to protect the women by giving them work permits, but authorities now fear that this business is out of control: \"We've realized this is no longer about small-scale entrepreneurs, but that big crime organizations are involved here in trafficking women, drugs, killings and other criminal activities\", said Job Cohen, the former mayor of Amsterdam.\n\nMore recently, officials have noticed an increase in violence centered on this irregular industry, and have blamed this increase on the illegal immigration of individuals into Amsterdam to participate in the sex industry: \"The guys from Eastern Europe bring in young and frightened women; they threaten them and beat them\", said a resident of De Wallen. Prostitution has remained connected to criminal activities, which has led the authorities to take several measures, including detailed plans to help the prostitutes quit the sex trade and find other professions.\n\nIn 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, \"Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt\" (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing.\n\nIn response to the problems associated with the involvement of organized crime into the sex trade, the Dutch government has decided to close numerous prostitution businesses. Concerned about organized crime, money laundering and human trafficking, Amsterdam officials under Mayor Cohen denied the license renewals of about 30 brothels in the Amsterdam Red-light district De Wallen in 2006; the brothel owners appealed. To counter negative news reports, the district organized an open house day in 2007 and a statue to an unknown sex worker was unveiled, \"intended to honor those employed in the industry world-wide.\" In September 2007 it was announced that the city of Amsterdam was buying several buildings in the Red-light district from Charles Geerts in order to close about a third of the windows.\n\nAt the end of 2008, Mayor Cohen announced plans to close half of the city's 400 prostitution windows because of suspected criminal gang activity. The mayor is also closing some of the city's 70 marijuana cafes and sex clubs. This comes at the same time as the Government's decision to ban the sale of \"magic mushrooms\" and the closure of all coffee shops situated near schools. Nevertheless, Mayor Cohen has noted, \"It is not that we want to get rid of our Red-light district. We want to reduce it. Things have become unbalanced and if we do not act we will never regain control.\"\n\nIn 2009 the Dutch justice ministry announced the appointment of a special public prosecutor charged with closing down prostitution windows and coffee shops connected to organized crime syndicates.\n\nA law proposal was introduced in the House of Representatives of the Netherlands in 2009 and amended in 2010 which would ban prostitution by people younger than 21. Prostitutes are required to register; they receive a registration pass with a photograph and a registration number, but no name or other personal data. Clients are required to check this pass. In addition to municipal rules a national rule is introduced requiring sex companies to have a license, including prostitution companies such as brothels and escort agencies, but also, for example, adult movie theaters. Under the proposed amendments, an advertisement of an individual prostitute should contain his or her registration number, an advertisement of a sex company should contain its license number. The premises for public access of a sex company (if any) should have on the outside a sign showing that the company is licensed, while inside a copy of the license has to be displayed.\nA vote on the law has been deferred to allow both sides to examine the matter more closely.\n\nThe 70-year-old twin sisters Louise and Martine Fokkens, who have worked for decades as prostitutes in the Red-light districts of Amsterdam, were the subject of a 2011 film and a 2012 book. In a 2012 interview they complained that the legalisation of 2000 had led to more criminality and to taxation of the trade.\n\nCountries that are major sources of trafficked persons include Thailand, India, The Netherlands, Mexico, China, Nigeria, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, Sierra Leone, and Romania.\n\nAccording to figures obtained from the National Centre against Human Trafficking, there were 1,711 registered presumed victims of human trafficking in 2012, of whom 1,177 were women forced to work in the sex industry. However, an increase in identified presumed victims does not necessarily mean an increase in trafficking but can be caused by, for instance, better awareness and cooperation among the different agencies which come into contact with potential victims.\n\nWithin the Netherlands, victims are often recruited by so-called \"loverboys\" – men who seduce young Dutch women and girls and later coerce them into prostitution. The phenomenon was highlighted in 2008 by , who published a book about her ordeal as the 12-year-old victim of a loverboy. The truthfulness of this book is disputed, and was the subject of an investigative journalism report.\nMany victims of human trafficking are led to believe by organized criminals that they are being offered work in hotels or restaurants or in child care and are forced into prostitution with the threat or actual use of violence. Estimates of the number of victims vary from 1,000 to 7,000 on a yearly basis. Most police investigations on human trafficking concern legal sex businesses. All sectors of prostitution are well represented in these investigations, but particularly the window brothels are overrepresented. \n\nAt the end of 2008, a gang of six people was sentenced to prison terms of eight months to 7½ years in what prosecutors said was the worst case of human trafficking ever brought to trial in the Netherlands. The case involved more than 100 female victims, violently forced to work in prostitution. In December 2009, two Nigerian men were sentenced to 4 and 4½ years in prison for having smuggled 140 Nigerian women aged 16–23 into the Netherlands. The women were made to apply for asylum and then disappeared from asylum centers, to work as prostitutes in surrounding countries. The men were said to have used \"voodoo\" curses on the women to prevent escape and enforce payment of debts.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks the Netherlands as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The fundamental tools of a redevelopment agency include the authority to acquire real property, the power of eminent domain, to develop and sell property without bidding and the authority and responsibility of relocating persons who have interests in the property acquired by the agency. The financing/funding of such operations might come from government grants, borrowing from federal or state governments and selling bonds and from Tax Increment Financing.\n\nOther terms sometimes used to describe redevelopment include urban renewal (urban revitalization). While efforts described as urban revitalization often involve redevelopment, they do not always involve redevelopment as they do not always involve the demolition of any existing structures but may instead describe the rehabilitation of existing buildings or other neighborhood improvement initiatives.\n\nA new example of other neighborhood improvement initiatives is the funding mechanism associated with high carbon footprint air quality urban blight. Assembly Bill AB811 is the State of California's answer to funding renewable energy and allows cities to craft their own sustainability action plans. These cutting edge action plans needs the funding structure; which can easily come forward through redevelopment funding.\n\nSome redevelopment projects and programs have been incredibly controversial including the Urban Renewal program in the United States in the mid-twentieth century or the urban regeneration program in Great Britain. Controversy usually results either from the use of eminent domain, from objections to the change in use or increases in density and intensity on the site or from disagreement on the appropriate use of tax-payer funds to pay for some element of the project.\nUrban redevelopment in the United States has been controversial because it forcibly displaces poor and lower middle class populations and turns over their land to wealthy redevelopers for free or for a below-market-value price. They then use that land to construct private shopping malls, office buildings, automobile factories and dealerships, and even gambling casinos. This is done and permitted by American courts in spite of the fact that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution allows the use of eminent domain only for \"public use.\"\n\nThe residents displaced by redevelopment are routinely undercompensated, and some (notably month-to-month tenants and business owners) are not compensated at all. Historically, redevelopment agencies have been buying many properties in redevelopment areas for prices below their fair market value, or even below the agencies' own appraisal figures because the displaced people are often unaware of their legal rights and lack the will and the funds to mount a proper legal defense in a valuation trial. Those who do so usually recover more in compensation than what is offered by the redevelopment agencies.\n\nThe controversy over misuse of eminent domain for redevelopment reached a climax in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2005 5 to 4 decision in \"Kelo v. City of New London,\" allowing redevelopment takings of sound, unblighted homes, solely to allow redevelopers to put the taken land to more profitable uses and thus increase the revenue flow to the local municipality. The \"Kelo\" decision was widely denounced and remains the subject of severe criticism. Remedial legislation has been introduced and in some cases passed, in a number of states.\n\nGolf course redevelopment, also known as golf course conversion is a real estate niche, in which investors purchase failing golf courses. Investors then subdivide the golf course into individual plots of lands. They then resell the plots of land for builders, or build on the plots then resell it to residential home buyers. This process is usually done with the assistance of a real estate broker.\n\nThe main challenge of this niche is the difficulties that investors face in requesting a variance from cities.\n\nNorth America:\n\nEurope:\n\nAsia:\n\nCentral America:\n"}

Prevalence rates of sexual violence against people with intellectual disabilities are high when compared with the experience of the general population. Whilst people with intellectual disabilities experience sexual violence in many of the same ways as the general population, they may encounter additional issues relating to their impairments and the social environments in which they live. These can include increased vulnerability, questions around ability to consent to sexual activities, differential treatment before the law, social attitudes about intellectual disability and sexuality, and restricted access to suitable support and recovery services.\n\nThere are large differences between the prevalence and incidence estimates from different pieces of research: results are affected by a number of factors:\n\nMorris showed, in a British study in 1999, that incidence data on sexual abuse of disabled children can be difficult to compile because:\n\nThe highest rate of occurrence of abuse happens within the place of residence of the persons with intellectual disabilities. Other areas of frequency where abuse occurs were at the perpetrator's home and in other public places, such as public toilets.\n\nStudies indicate that people with intellectual disabilities are four to ten times more likely to have acts of violence committed against them. Dick Sobsey, Associate Director of the JP Das Developmental Disabilities Centre and Director of the John Dossetor Health Ethics Centre, found that 80% out of 162 people with developmental and substantial disabilities who had been sexually assaulted had been sexually assaulted more than once.\n\nSobsey estimates that between 15,000 and 19,000 individuals with intellectual disabilities experience rape each year.\n\nIt is believed by some that 20% of females and 10% of males are sexually abused in the US every year. The percentage is even higher among people with disabilities. According to research, more than 90% of people with intellectual disabilities will experience some form of sexual abuse at some time in their lives. 49% will experience 10 or more abusive incidents.\n\nOther studies suggest 68% of girls with intellectual disabilities and 30% of boys with intellectual disabilities will be sexually abused before their 18th birthday. According to research 15,000 to 19,000 people with intellectual disabilities are raped each year in the United States.\n\nSullivan and Knutson found, in 2000, that children with intellectual disabilities were at slightly greater risk of sexual abuse than disabled children in general, who in turn were at 3.14 times greater risk of experiencing sexual abuse than non-disabled children.\n\nA study by McCarthy and Thompson in 1997 found a prevalence rate of 25% for men and 61% for women. A survey by Brown et al. of senior managers in 1992 found an incidence rate of 0.5 per thousand people with intellectual disabilities each year.\n\nA study by Dunne and Power in 1990 found an incidence rate of 2.88 per thousand people with intellectual disabilities per year.\n\nA study by Gil-Llario, Morell-Mengual, Ballester-Arnal and Díaz-Rodríguez in 2017 found a prevalence rate of 2.8% for men and 9.4% for women. Among the women who were abused, only 52.9% trusted someone enough to tell them about what had happened. Of these, 28.6% preferred to tell a close relative, 57.1% told an educator and 14.3% talked to a friend about it. Of the men, 80% decided to talk about their experience of abuse. Half of them (50%) told their father or mother, 25% talked to an educator and 25% discussed the matter with a close relative.\n\nAnother Spanish study indicates that the prevalence of sexual abuse is 6.10% when it is self‐reported (9.4% in women and 2.8% in men) and 28.6% when it is reported by professionals (27.8% in women and 29.4% in men).\n\nA number of factors put people with intellectual disabilities at an increased risk of sexual violence. Medical models of disability emphasise risks connected with the person's disability, while social models of disability focus on risks caused by the socially-created environment of the intellectually disabled person. Not all factors will apply to all people with intellectual disabilities, and some are not exclusive to people with intellectual disabilities.\n\n\nPeople with moderate to severe intellectual disabilities, and those with additional physical disabilities, form the majority of learning disabled people experiencing sexual violence.\n\nResearch suggests that 97% to 99% of abusers are known and trusted by the victim who has the intellectual disability. According to Sobsey and Doe's 1991 analysis of 162 reports of sexual abuse against people with intellectual disabilities, the largest percentage of offenders (28%) were service providers (direct care staff members, personal care attendants, psychiatrists). In addition, 19% of sexual offenders were natural or stepfamily members, 15.2% were acquaintances (neighbors, family friends), 9.8% were informal paid service providers (babysitters), and 3.8% were dates. Further, 81.7% of the victims were women, and 90.8% of the offenders were men.\n\nMcCarthy identifies people with intellectual disabilities who are current or past users of services as another significant group of perpetrators.\n\nCases of sexual abuse are considered in many states to qualify as “sexual assault” under the law; sexual assault is often arbitrated through rape or sexual battery statutes. Cases of sexual assault are arbitrated differently according to individual state laws and statutes.\n\nStates often have statutes for the intellectually disabled person separate from the general sex offense statutes. Such separate statutes often hold the intellectually disabled person at a “higher standard” than the non-intellectually-disabled person; that is, the legal standards used to prove sexual consent will be stricter for the intellectually disabled individual.\n\nAs Deborah W. Denno, Ph.D., J.D., of the Fordham University School of Law explains, “courts have applied vague, unworkable tests in determining a mentally retarded victim's capacity to consent; it would be unrealistic to suggest that a rigid, precisely defined standard could ever be effective in so amorphous an area as sexual relations.”\n\nSix tests are used as such a standard to assess the legal capacity of the intellectually disabled individual to consent to sexual conduct. These are the tests of “nature and consequences”, “morality”, “nature of the conduct”, “totality of the circumstances”, “evidence of mental disability”, and “judgment”. 49 American states use one of these six tests in reviewing cases of sexual abuse, with the exception of Illinois (which uses two tests).\n\nIntellectually disabled people do get special protection under Australian law. In the penal code, a person is defined as mentally defective if they suffer from \"a mental disease or defect which renders him or her incapable of appraising the nature of his or her conduct.\" The special protection granted to those with intellectual disabilities in these cases is akin to the statutory protection given to children. In cases of sexual abuse, actual consent is irrelevant, because the person is incapable of giving legal consent.\n\nThe Sexual Offences Act 2003 defines sexual offences in general, including those perpetrated against or by adults or children. The Act includes specific crimes against adults with intellectual disabilities or mental health conditions:\n\nsexual abuse of vulnerable persons with a mental disorder. These include situations where:\n\nDaniel D. Sorensen, Chair of the Victims of Crime Committee, Criminal Justice Task Force for People with Developmental Disabilities estimates that less than 4.5% of crimes against people with intellectual disabilities in California are reported compared to the 44% of the general public who experience crimes. The Seattle Rape Relief Project program for victims of sexual assault with intellectual disabilities conclude that there is underreporting of sexual assaults of victims with intellectual disabilities that exceed underreporting with other populations. Several studies suggest 80-85% of criminal abuse of residents of institutions never reach the proper authorities. The studies have found that 40% of those criminally abused and 40% of non-abusing staff of care facilities studied are reluctant to come forward with criminal abuse issues for fear of reprisals or retribution from administrators.\n\nPeople with intellectual disabilities can be harmed by sexual violence. The harm is often worse when the violence takes place over a long period and the perpetrator is known to the survivor. The following effects have been reported, but may not be experienced by all learning disabled survivors of sexual violence:\n\n\nIndividuals with intellectual disabilities can find it difficult to communicate when sexual abuse is occurring due to communication barriers. It is important for family members and caregivers to recognize some of the behavioral changes that could indicate when sexual abuse is occurring. Some of the following are behavioral changes that have been seen in some but not all victims of sexual abuse:\n\n\n\n"}

Demographers and researchers typically use mid-to-late 1920s as starting birth years and early-to-mid 1940s as ending birth years for this cohort.\n\nIt is unclear where the term originated, although it is widely accepted that the term \"Silent Generation\" comes from the focus on careers over activism. As young adults during the McCarthy Era, many members of the Silent Generation felt it was dangerous to speak out. \"Time\" magazine first used the term \"Silent Generation\" in a November 5, 1951 article titled \"The Younger Generation\", although the term appears to precede the publication. The name was originally applied to people in the United States and Canada but has been applied as well to those in Western Europe, Australia and South America. It includes most of those who fought during the Korean War. In the United States, the generation was comparatively small because the financial insecurity of the 1930s and the war in the early 1940s caused people to have fewer children. They are noted as forming the leadership of the civil rights movement as well as comprising the “silent majority”.\n\nThey have also been named the \"Lucky Few\" in the 2008 book \"The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom\", by Elwood D. Carlson PhD, the Charles B. Nam Professor in Sociology of Population at Florida State University. Carlson notes that this was the first generation in American history to be smaller than the generation that preceded them. He calls the people of this generation \"The Lucky Few\", because even though they were born during the Great Depression and World War II, they moved into adulthood during the relatively prosperous 1950s and early 1960s. For men who served in the Korean War, their military service was not marked by high casualties as much as the previous generation. The Lucky Few also had higher employment rates than the generations before and after them, as well as better health and earlier retirement. African Americans in this generation also did better than earlier generations in education and employment.\n\nAustralia's McCrindle Research uses the name \"Builders\" to describe the Australian members of this generation, born between 1925 and 1945, and coming of age to become the generation \"who literally and metaphorically built [the] nation after the austerity years post-Depression and World War II\".\n\nPew Research uses 1928 to 1945 as birth years for this cohort.\n\nResolution Foundation, in a report titled \"Cross Countries: International comparisons of international trends\", uses 1926 to 1945 as birth dates for the Silent Generation.\n\nDemographers William Strauss and Neil Howe use 1925–42 as birth years.\n\nThe generation includes many political and civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Pope Francis, Pope Benedict XVI, The 14th Dalai Lama, Malcolm X, Michael Dukakis, John McCain, Walter Mondale, Dick Cheney, Bernie Sanders, Robert F. Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Raúl Alfonsín, Giuliano Amato, Kofi Annan, Silvio Berlusconi, Mikhail Gorbachev, B.J. Habibie, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, John Howard, Saddam Hussein, Ion Iliescu, Helmut Kohl, John Major, Paul Martin, Slobodan Milošević, Mahathir Mohamad, Madeleine Albright, John Lewis, Hosea Williams and Warren Christopher.\n\nIt includes such writers and artists as Elvis Presley, George Carlin, Ursula Andress, Jim Morrison, Julie Andrews, Anne Bancroft, Brigitte Bardot, John Cleese, Judi Dench, Harrison Ford, Audrey Hepburn, Janet Leigh, Sophia Loren, Shirley MacLaine, Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol, Sylvia Plath, Joan Baez, Jane Fonda, Angela Lansbury, Mary Tyler Moore, Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor, Shirley Temple, Gene Wilder, Natalie Wood, Alan Arkin, Warren Beatty, Richard Burton, James Caan, James Coburn, Sean Connery, James Dean, Robert Duvall, Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Andy Williams, James Garner, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris, Dustin Hoffman, Anthony Hopkins, Dennis Hopper, Rock Hudson, James Earl Jones, Frank Langella, Jack Lemmon, Roger Moore, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Peter O'Toole, Sam Cooke, Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer, Robert Redford, Oliver Reed, Burt Reynolds, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, Bo Diddley, B.B. King, Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, George Takei, Adam West, Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, Stephen Sondheim, James Brown, Sammy Davis Jr., Bobby Darin, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, the Everly Brothers, Marvin Gaye, Glenn Gould, Don Rickles, Joan Rivers, the Beat Generation, Noam Chomsky and Richard Rorty.\n\nGreat athletes include Hank Aaron, Muhammad Ali, Roger Bannister, Ron Barassi, Richie Benaud, Yogi Berra, Jim Brown, Rubin Carter, Wilt Chamberlain, Bobby Charlton, Roy Emerson, Dawn Fraser, Reg Gasnier, Althea Gibson, Gordie Howe, Sandy Koufax, Jack Kyle, John Landy, Rod Laver, Sonny Liston, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Bob Mathias, Willie Mays, Allan Moffat, Bobby Moore, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Floyd Patterson, Pelé, Pete Rose, Ken Rosewall, Garfield Sobers, Jackie Stewart, Ted Whitten, and Lev Yashin.\n\nIf the Silent Generation is deemed to include persons born between 1925 and 1942, the generation produced no U.S. presidents. The U.S. essentially \"jumped from George Bush Sr., the World War II veteran, to Baby Boomer Bill Clinton\". However, it did produce Vice Presidents Joe Biden (born 1942), Dick Cheney (born 1941) and Walter Mondale (born 1928) and First Ladies Barbara Bush (born 1925), Rosalynn Carter (born 1927), and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (born 1929). Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush were born in what is sometimes considered to be the last year of the G.I. Generation (1924).\n\n\n"}

In November 655, the bishops of Carthaginiensis held a provincial synod in Toledo, the Ninth Council of Toledo. They scheduled a second council for 1 November the next year, but a general council was called by the king. \n\nThe tenth council was attended by only seventeen bishops and five deputies from Carthaginiensis and Gallaecia. The metropolitan of Toledo, Eugenius II, joined by his fellow metropolitans, Fugitivus of Seville and Potamius of Braga, attended from Baetica, but no bishops came from Tarraconensis or Gallia Narbonensis. This made it the most poorly attended of the great general councils of the \"Siglo de Concilios\" (7th century). \n\nThe council declared that all clerical oathbreakers were to be defrocked and/or exiled, leaving it up to the king to decide whether both punishments were necessary. The council also expelled, from the family of the church, all clerics of all ranks who, in the future, were caught trading Christian slaves with Jews. The bishops further worked to ameliorate conflicts within the church and enforce ecclesiastic discipline. Potamius of Braga admitted to carnal sins and was retired to a monastery, replaced by Fructuosus, whose old see of Dumio had its own conflict. The last will and testament of the recently deceased bishop of Dumium, Riccimer, was disputed over those who saw his freeing of slaves and distribution of monies to the poor without compensation as responsible for the subsequent impoverishment of that see. It was given to his successor (Fructuosus) to decide exactly what to do, but his actions without compensation were considered unlawful. The council closed and Reccesuinth did not call another for the rest of his reign (672), which is thus an obscure era in Spanish history. \n\nAs an aside, it is possible that the later King Wamba was summoned to produce the will of St Martin of Braga by Reccesuinth.\n\n"}
{"id": "173620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173620", "title": "Venona project", "text": "Venona project\n\nThe Venona project was a counterintelligence program initiated by the United States Army's Signal Intelligence Service (later the National Security Agency) that ran from February 1, 1943 until October 1, 1980. The purpose of the Venona project was the decryption of messages transmitted by the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union (e.g. the NKVD, the KGB, and the GRU). During the 37-year duration of the Venona project, the Signal Intelligence Service obtained approximately 3,000 Soviet messages (only a small fraction of which were ever decrypted); the signals intelligence yield included discovery of the Cambridge Five espionage ring in the UK and Soviet espionage of the Manhattan Project in the U.S. (project ENORMOS / операции энормоз) for the Soviet atomic bomb project. The Venona project remained secret for more than 15 years after it concluded, and some of the decoded Soviet messages were not declassified and published until 1995.\n\nDuring the initial years of the Cold War, the Venona project was a source of information on Soviet intelligence-gathering directed at the Western military powers. Although unknown to the public, and even to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, these programs were of importance concerning crucial events of the early Cold War. These included the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spying case and the defections of Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess to the Soviet Union.\n\nMost decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945. Sometime in 1945, the existence of the Venona program was revealed to the Soviet Union by cryptologist-analyst Bill Weisband, an NKVD agent in the U.S. Army’s SIGINT. These messages were slowly and gradually decrypted beginning in 1946 and continuing (many times at a low-level of effort in the latter years) through 1980, when the Venona program was terminated, and the remaining amount of effort that was being spent on it was moved to more important projects.\n\nTo what extent the various individuals were involved with Soviet intelligence is a topic of dispute. While a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the Venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of Soviet intelligence agents, others argue that many of those people probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.\n\nThe Venona Project was initiated on February 1, 1943 by Gene Grabeel, an American mathematician and cryptanalyst, under orders from Colonel Carter W. Clarke, Chief of Special Branch of the Military Intelligence Service at that time. Clarke distrusted Joseph Stalin, and feared that the Soviet Union would sign a separate peace with Nazi Germany, allowing Germany to focus its military forces against the United Kingdom and the United States. Cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army's Signal Intelligence Service at Arlington Hall analyzed encrypted high-level Soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after World War II by American, British, and Australian listening posts.\n\nThis message traffic, which was encrypted with a one-time pad system, was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy by hundreds of cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s. When used correctly, the one-time pad encryption system, which has been used for all the most secret military and diplomatic communication since the 1930s, is unbreakable. However, due to a serious blunder on the part of the Soviets, some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers, as a result of pressures brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication—which undermines the security of a one-time system—was discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely separated users. Despite this, the reuse was detected by cryptanalysts in the US.\n\nThe Soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers, to which additive keys (from one-time pads) were added, encrypting the content. When used correctly so that the plain text is of a length equal to or less than that of a random key, one-time pad encryption is unbreakable. However, cryptanalysis by American and British code-breakers revealed that some of the one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the Soviets (specifically, entire pages, although not complete books), which allowed decryption (sometimes only partial) of a small part of the traffic.\n\nGenerating the one-time pads was a slow and labor-intensive process, and the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941 caused a sudden increase in the need for coded messages. It is probable that the Soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand.\n\nIt was Arlington Hall's Lieutenant Richard Hallock, working on Soviet \"Trade\" traffic (so called because these messages dealt with Soviet trade issues), who first discovered that the Soviets were reusing pages. Hallock and his colleagues, amongst whom were Genevieve Feinstein, Cecil Phillips, Frank Lewis, Frank Wanat, and Lucille Campbell, went on to break into a significant amount of Trade traffic, recovering many one-time pad additive key tables in the process.\nA young Meredith Gardner then used this material to break into what turned out to be NKVD (and later GRU) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers. Samuel Chew and Cecil Phillips also made valuable contributions. On 20 December 1946, Gardner made the first break into the code, revealing the existence of Soviet espionage in the Manhattan Project.\nVenona messages also indicated that Soviet spies worked in Washington in the State Department, Treasury, Office of Strategic Services, and even the White House. Very slowly, using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to defector information, more of the messages were decrypted.\n\nClaims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books (a partially burned one was obtained by the Finns) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices (analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext. These latter claims are less than fully supported in the open literature.\n\nOne significant aid (mentioned by the NSA) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the Japanese and Finnish cryptanalysis organizations; when the Americans broke into Japanese codes during World War II, they gained access to this information. There are also reports that copies of signals purloined from Soviet offices by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were helpful in the cryptanalysis. The Finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning Soviet codes to OSS in 1944 during Operation Stella Polaris, including the partially burned code book.\n\nNSA reported that (according to the serial numbers of the Venona cables) thousands of cables were sent, but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts. Approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated; about half of the 1943 GRU-Naval Washington to Moscow messages were broken, but none for any other year, although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945. The decryption rate of the NKVD cables was as follows:\n\nOut of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts, it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted. All the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942, and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945, with a few being used as late as 1948. After this, Soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable.\n\nThe existence of Venona decryption became known to the Soviets within a few years of the first breaks. It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence Service representative to the U.S. Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.\n\nThe decrypted messages gave important insights into Soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used. With the first break into the code, Venona revealed the existence of Soviet espionage\nat Los Alamos National Laboratories.\nIdentities soon emerged of American, Canadian, Australian, and British spies in service to the Soviet government, including Klaus Fuchs, Alan Nunn May, and Donald Maclean. Others worked in Washington in the State Department, the Treasury, Office of Strategic Services,\nand even the White House.\n\nThe messages show that the U.S. and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the Soviet Union as early as 1942. Among those identified are Julius and Ethel Rosenberg; Alger Hiss; Harry Dexter White, the second-highest official in the Treasury Department; Lauchlin Currie,\na personal aide to Franklin Roosevelt; and Maurice Halperin,\na section head in the Office of Strategic Services.\n\nThe identification of individuals mentioned in Venona transcripts is sometimes problematic, since people with a \"covert relationship\" with Soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms.\nFurther complicating matters is the fact the same person sometimes had different cryptonyms at different times, and the same cryptonym was sometimes reused for different individuals. In some cases, notably Hiss, the matching of a Venona cryptonym to an individual is disputed. In many other cases, a Venona cryptonym has not yet been linked to any person. According to authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, the Venona transcripts identify approximately 349 Americans who they claim had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence, though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities. However, not every agent may have been communicating directly with Soviet intelligence. Each of those 349 persons may have had many others working for, and reporting only to, them.\n\nThe Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the CIA, housed at one time or another between fifteen and twenty Soviet spies.\nDuncan Lee, Donald Wheeler, Jane Foster Zlatowski, and Maurice Halperin passed information to Moscow. The War Production Board, the Board of Economic Warfare, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the Office of War Information, included at least half a dozen Soviet sources each among their employees.\n\nVenona has added information—some unequivocal, some ambiguous—to several espionage cases. Some known spies, including Theodore Hall, were neither prosecuted nor publicly implicated, because the Venona evidence against them was withheld.\n\nThe identity of Soviet source cryptonymed \"19\" remains unclear. According to British writer Nigel West, \"19\" was president of Czechoslovak government-in-exile Edvard Beneš. Military historian Eduard Mark and American authors Herbert Romerstein and Eric Breindel concluded it was Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins. According to American authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, \"19\" could be someone from the British delegation to the Washington Conference in May 1943. Moreover, they argue no evidence of Hopkins as an agent has been found in other archives, and the partial message relating to \"19\" does not indicate if this source was a spy.\n\nHowever, Vasily Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist who defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 with copies of large numbers of KGB files. He claimed Harry Hopkins was a secret Russian agent. Moreover, Oleg Gordievsky, a high-level KGB officer who also defected from the Soviet Union, reported that Iskhak Akhmerov, the KGB officer who controlled the clandestine Soviet agents in the U.S. during the war, had said Hopkins was \"the most important of all Soviet wartime agents in the United States.\"\n\nAlexander Vassiliev's notes identified source code-named \"19\" as Laurence Duggan.\n\nVenona has added significant information to the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, making it clear Julius was guilty of espionage, and also showing that Ethel, while not acting as a principal, still acted as an accessory, had full knowledge of Julius's espionage activity and played the main role in the recruitment of her brother for atomic espionage.\n\nVenona and other recent information has shown, while the content of Julius' atomic espionage was not as vital to the Soviets as alleged at the time of his espionage activities, in other fields it was extensive. The information Rosenberg passed to the Soviets concerned the proximity fuze, design and production information on the Lockheed P-80 jet fighter, and thousands of classified reports from Emerson Radio.\n\nThe Venona evidence indicates unidentified sources code-named \"Quantum\" and \"Pers\" who facilitated transfer of nuclear weapons technology to the Soviet Union from positions within the Manhattan Project. According to Alexander Vassiliev's notes from KGB archive, \"Quantum\" was Boris Podolsky and \"Pers\" was Russell W. McNutt, an engineer from the uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge.\n\nThe Venona decryptions were also important in the exposure of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. Some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the Manhattan Project, who was referred to by the code names of CHARLES and REST. One such message from Moscow to New York, dated April 10, 1945, called information provided by CHARLES \"of great value.\" Noting that the information included \"data on the atomic mass of the nuclear explosive\" and \"details on the explosive method of actuating\" the atomic bomb, the message requested further technical details from CHARLES. Investigations based on the VENONA decryptions eventually identified CHARLES and REST as Fuchs in 1949.\n\nAccording to the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, the complicity of both Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White is conclusively proven by Venona, stating \"The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department.\"\nIn his 1998 book, Senator Moynihan expressed certainty about Hiss's identification by Venona as a Soviet spy, writing \"Hiss was indeed a Soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by Moscow as its most important.\"\n\nSeveral current authors, researchers, and archivists consider the Venona evidence on Hiss to be inconclusive.\n\nKim Philby had access to CIA and FBI files, and more damaging, access to Venona Project briefings. When Philby learned of Venona in 1949, he obtained advance warning that his fellow Soviet spy Donald Maclean was in danger of being exposed. The FBI told Philby about an agent cryptonymed \"Homer\", whose 1945 message to Moscow had been decoded. As it had been sent from New York and had its origins in the British Embassy in Washington, Philby, who would not have known Maclean's cryptonym, deduced the sender's identity. By early 1951, Philby knew U.S. intelligence would soon also conclude Maclean was the sender, and advised Moscow to extract Maclean. This led to Maclean and Guy Burgess' flight in May 1951 to Moscow, where they lived the remainder of their lives.\n\nIn addition to British and American operatives, Australians collected Venona intercepts at a remote base in the Outback. The Soviets remained unaware of this base as late as 1950.\n\nThe founding of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) by Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley in 1949 was considered highly controversial within Chifley's own party. Until then, the left-leaning Australian Labor Party had been hostile to domestic intelligence agencies on civil-liberties grounds and a Labor government founding one seemed a surprising about-face. But the presentation of Venona material to Chifley, revealing evidence of Soviet agents operating in Australia, brought this about. As well as Australian diplomat suspects abroad, Venona had revealed Walter Seddon Clayton (cryptonym \"KLOD\"), a leading official within the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), as the chief organiser of Soviet intelligence gathering in Australia. Investigation revealed that Clayton formed an underground network within the CPA so that the party could continue to operate if it were banned. In 1950, George Ronald Richards was appointed ASIO's deputy-director of operations for Venona, based in Sydney, charged with investigating intelligence uncovered the eleven Australians identified in the cables that were decoded. He continued Venona-related work in London with MI5 from November 1952 and went on to lead Operation Cabin 12, the high-profile 1953–4 defection to Australia of Soviet spy Vladimir Petrov.\n\nFor much of its history, knowledge of Venona was restricted even from the highest levels of government. Senior army officers, in consultation with the FBI and CIA, made the decision to restrict knowledge of Venona within the government (even the CIA was not made an active partner until 1952). Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley, concerned about the White House's history of leaking sensitive information, decided to deny President Truman direct knowledge of the project. The president received the substance of the material only through FBI, Justice Department, and CIA reports on counterintelligence and intelligence matters. He was not told the material came from decoded Soviet ciphers. To some degree this secrecy was counter-productive; Truman was distrustful of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover and suspected the reports were exaggerated for political purposes.\n\nSome of the earliest detailed public knowledge that Soviet code messages from World War II had been broken came with the release of Chapman Pincher’s book, \"Too Secret Too Long\", in 1984. Robert Lamphere's book, \"The FBI-KGB War\", was released in 1986. Lamphere had been the FBI liaison to the code-breaking activity, had considerable knowledge of Venona and the counter-intelligence work that resulted from it. However, the first detailed account of the Venona project, identifying it by name and making clear its long-term implications in post-war espionage, was contained in MI5 assistant director Peter Wright's 1987 memoir, \"Spycatcher\".\n\nMany inside the NSA had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the Venona project, but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan Commission on Government Secrecy, with Senator Moynihan as chairman, released Venona project materials. Moynihan wrote:\n\n\"[The] secrecy system has systematically denied American historians access to the records of American history. Of late we find ourselves relying on archives of the former Soviet Union in Moscow to resolve questions of what was going on in Washington at mid-century. [...] the Venona intercepts contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds.\"\n\nOne of the considerations in releasing Venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names were not released because to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy.\nHowever, in at least one case, independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the NSA.\n\nThe dearth of reliable information available to the public—or even to the President and Congress—may have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of Soviet espionage in the United States. Anti-Communists suspected many spies remained at large, perhaps including some known to the government. Those who criticized the governmental and non-governmental efforts to root out and expose communists felt these efforts were an overreaction (in addition to other reservations about McCarthyism). Public access—or broader governmental access—to the Venona evidence would certainly have affected this debate, as it is affecting the retrospective debate among historians and others now. As the Moynihan Commission wrote in its final report:\n\n\"A balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear; the Venona messages will surely supply a great cache of facts to bring the matter to some closure. But at the time, the American Government, much less the American public, was confronted with possibilities and charges, at once baffling and terrifying.\"\nThe National Cryptologic Museum features an exhibit on the Venona project in its \"Cold War/Information Age\" gallery.\n\nControversy arose in 2009 over the Texas State Board of Education's revision of their high school history class curricula to suggest Venona shows Senator Joseph McCarthy to have been justified in his zeal in exposing those whom he believed to be Soviet spies or communist sympathizers. Critics assert most people and organizations identified by McCarthy were not mentioned in the Venona content and that his accusations remain largely unsupported by evidence.\n\nThe majority of historians are convinced of the historical value of the Venona material. Intelligence historian Nigel West believes that \"Venona remain[s] an irrefutable resource, far more reliable than the mercurial recollections of KGB defectors and the dubious conclusions drawn by paranoid analysts mesmerized by Machiavellian plots.\"\n\nHowever, a number of writers and scholars have taken a critical view of the translations. They question the accuracy of the translations and the identifications of covernames that the NSA translations give. Writers Walter and Miriam Schneir, in a lengthy 1999 review of one of the first book-length studies of the messages, object to what they see as the book’s overconfidence in the translations' accuracy, noting that the undecrypted gaps in the texts can make interpretation difficult, and emphasizing the problem of identifying the individuals mentioned under covernames. To support their critique, they cite a declassified memorandum, written in 1956 by A. H. Belmont, who was assistant to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover at the time. In the memo, Belmont discusses the possibility of using the Venona translations in court to prosecute Soviet agents, and comes out strongly opposed to their use. His reasons include legal uncertainties about the admissibility of the translations as evidence, and the difficulties that prosecution would face in supporting the validity of the translations. Belmont highlights the uncertainties in the translation process, noting that the cryptographers have indicated that \"almost anything included in a translation of one of these deciphered messages may in the future be radically revised.\" He also notes the complexities of identifying people with covernames, describing how the personal details mentioned for covername \"Antenna\" fit more than one person, and the investigative process required to finally connect \"Antenna\" to Julius Rosenberg. The Schneirs conclude that \"A reader faced with Venona's incomplete, disjointed messages can easily arrive at a badly skewed impression.\"\n\nMany of the critiques of the Venona translations have been based on specific cases. The Schneirs' critique of the Venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Another critique of the Venona translations came from the late Rutgers University law professor John Lowenthal, who as a law student worked as a volunteer for Alger Hiss's defense team, and later wrote extensively on the Hiss case. Lowenthal's critique focused on one message (Venona 1822 KGB Washington-Moscow 30 March 1945), in which the comments identified the covername 'Ales' as \"probably Alger Hiss.\" Lowenthal raised a number of objections to this identification, rejecting it as \"a conclusion psychologically motivated and politically correct but factually wrong.\" Lowenthal's article led to an extended debates on the 'Ales' message, and even prompted the NSA to declassify the original Russian text. Currently Venona 1822 is the only message for which the complete decrypted Russian text has been published.\n\nVictor Navasky, editor and publisher of \"The Nation\", has also written several editorials highly critical of John Earl Haynes' and Harvey Klehr's interpretation of recent work on the subject of Soviet espionage. Navasky claims the Venona material is being used to \"distort … our understanding of the cold war\" and that the files are potential \"time bombs of misinformation.\" Commenting on the list of 349 Americans identified by Venona, published in an appendix to \"Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America\", Navasky wrote, \"The reader is left with the implication—unfair and unproven—that every name on the list was involved in espionage, and as a result, otherwise careful historians and mainstream journalists now routinely refer to Venona as proof that many hundreds of Americans were part of the red spy network.\" Navasky goes further in his defense of the listed people and has claimed a great deal of the so-called espionage that went on was nothing more than \"exchanges of information among people of good will\" and that \"most of these exchanges were innocent and were within the law.\"\n\nAccording to historian Ellen Schrecker, \"Because they offer insights into the world of the secret police on both sides of the Iron Curtain, it is tempting to treat the FBI and Venona materials less critically than documents from more accessible sources.

Success in a military campaign is considered a strategic victory, while the success in a military engagement is a tactical victory.\n\nIn terms of human emotion, victory accompanies strong feelings of elation, and in human behaviour often exhibits movements and poses paralleling threat display preceding the combat, which are associated with the excess endorphin built up preceding and during combat.\nVictory dances and victory cries similarly parallel war dances and war cries performed before the outbreak of physical violence.\n\nExamples of victory behaviour reported in Roman antiquity, where the term \"victoria\" originated, include: the victory songs of the Batavi mercenaries serving under Gaius Julius Civilis after the victory over Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD (according to Tacitus); and also the \"abominable song\" to Wodan, sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579. The sacrificial animal was a goat, around whose head the Langobards danced in a circle while singing their victory hymn.\nThe Roman Republic and Empire celebrated victories with triumph ceremonies and with monuments such as victory columns (e.g. Trajan's Column) and arches. A trophy is a token of victory taken from the defeated party, such as the enemy's weapons (\"spolia\"), or body parts (as in the case of head hunters).\n\nMythology often deifies victory, as in the cases of the Greek Nike or the Roman Victoria. The victorious agent is a hero, often portrayed as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a monster (as Saint George slaying the dragon, Indra slaying Ahi, Thor slaying the Midgard Serpent etc.). Sol Invictus (\"the Invincible Sun\") of Roman mythology became an epithet of Christ in Christianity. Paul of Tarsus presents the resurrection of Christ as a victory over Death and Sin (1 Corinthians 15:55.\n\nThe Latinate English-language word \"victory\" (from the 14th century) replaced the Old English equivalent term \"sige\" (cognate with Gothic \"sigis\", Old High German \"sigu\" and \"Sieg\" in modern German), a frequent element in Germanic names (as in Sigibert, Sigurd etc.), cognate to Celtic \"sego-\" and Sanskrit \"sahas\".\n\n\n"}
