The book is a critique of the architecture and urbanism of postmodern Britain, taking the form of a tour of British cities.\n\n\"A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain\" is Hatherley's second book, following a quartet of essays entitled \"Militant Modernism\" published in 2008. Considerable overlap and repetition exists between the two works.\n\nHatherley introduces \"A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain\" as \"an autopsy of the urban renaissance\", referring to a program initiated under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and associated with the private finance initiative, city academies and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. In his introduction, Hatherley quotes Karl Seitz's statement upon the opening of the Karl Marx-Hof in Vienna: \"by these stones shall we be judged.\" Seitz's words, set in the context of the attack on the Karl Marx-Hof a year later by fascists fighting the Austrian Civil War, serve as guiding principles for the book. The book forms a \"catalogue raisonné\" of what the author describes as \"pseudomodernism\".\n\nThe journey, on which Hatherley was accompanied by photographer Joel Anderson, begins in Southampton, where Hatherley grew up, and takes in Milton Keynes, Nottingham, Manchester, Tyneside, Glasgow, Cambridge, several towns in Yorkshire, Cardiff, Liverpool and Greenwich. Hatherley focuses on the prior decade's programmes of regeneration and the remains of past civic improvements. In Cambridge, Hatherley reluctantly praises the Accordia development; while in Glasgow he describes BBC Pacific Quay as \"decent, upstanding, moderate modernism\" and praises buildings in the vicinity of Glasgow Central station; and in Tyneside he praises T. Dan Smith's desire to build a \"Brasilia of the North\".\n\nHatherley most keenly explores the public and municipal architecture of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including Thamesmead in Greenwich, Red Road in Glasgow, Park Hill in Sheffield and the \"Get Carter\" car park in Gateshead. Particular attention is paid to \"the Former Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire\", where Hatherley sees the promise of Socialist Brutalism having come closest to fulfillment. Hatherley criticises Bob Kerslake, the former chief executive of Sheffield City Council who presided over the demolition of council housing, and the Pathfinder scheme.\n\nHatherley's influences include Ian Nairn, Nikolaus Pevsner, J. B. Priestley's \"English Journey\" and Iain Sinclair.\n\nPatrick Wright, writing in \"Architecture Today\", compares Hatherley's approach to that of William Cobbett, the 19th century agitator who criticised industrialisation in his \"Rural Rides\"; however, he points out that while Cobbett defended the British countryside, Hatherley is concerned with the urban Britain envisioned by post-war Modernist architects which he argues has fallen victim to regeneration schemes.\n\nRowan Moore, writing in \"The Observer\", describes Hatherley as \"not entirely fair\" for his failure to grant a right of reply to those he criticises, the book's lack of input from the citizens and residents of the areas described, and its lack of any proposed alternative, but describes \"A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain\" as \"essentially right: for all the talk of renewal, renaissance, regeneration and world-class architecture, and all the billions expended, our cities are, with some exceptions, more screwed up than they have ever been.\"\n\nWill Self, reviewing \"Militant Modernism\" and \"A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain\" in the \"London Review of Books\", describes the latter as \"engaging and even stimulating\", but argues that Hatherley fails to accept the deep-seated and philoprogenitive bad taste of the masses, instead favouring an ethic shaped by urban reductionism. Self also alleges similarities between Hatherley's argument regarding \"pseudomodernism\" and that of the architect Rem Koolhaas, whose work Hatherley criticises.\n\n"}

The Armenians were to build Vitovnica Monastery, which has preserved a bilingual sacral text in Serbian and Armenian dating to the building.\n\nArmenians were a small part of the Ottoman Turkish army when they invaded Serbia prior to the Battle of Kosovo 1389. However upon hearing that they would attack a Christian people, they fled the Ottomans to the other side to fight alongside the Serbs. After the battle, the surviving Armenians settled in the hills of Sokobanja where they built Jermenčić Monastery. \n\nEvliya Celebi registers an Armenian \"district\" of Užice in the 17th century.\n\nRemains of an Armenian graveyard lie in Kalemegdan fortress, which was last used in the 17th century after the Ottomans destroyed it. Only a few tombs are left in good condition. In 1810 the Turks destroyed the Celije Monastery, and the Serbs rebuilt it in 1811 with the help of wealthy Armenians. One of the benefactors had his idea of an Armenian style dome included in the work, so the monastery today can be considered an outcome of Byzantine/Serbian-Armenian architecture.\n\nIn 1880s, merchants from the Gamakh region in Armenia settled in Valjevo (Tehlirians). Among the Tehlirians was Soghomon Tehlirian's father. During the Second World War, many Armenians moved to North America and France.\n\nIn the past, there used to be an Armenian Catholic church in Novi Sad (built in 1746, razed in 1963).\n\nSome 500 female Serbian descendants of Armenians married Serbs in the 1990s.\n\nArmenia and Serbia established diplomatic relations in 1992. Armenia is represented in Serbia through its embassy in Athens, Greece. Serbia is also represented in Armenia through its embassy in Athens. The \"Armenka\" association of ethnic Armenians in Serbia which holds community affairs is led by Gohar Harutyunyan-Sekulic.\n\nOn July 28, 2009, Boris Tadic arrived in Armenia, becoming the first Serbian head of state visit to Armenia. The presidents wished to improve the spiritual, cultural and economic relations of the two countries stressing that the centuries long friendship between the peoples are good basis on boosting the bilateral relations. Armenia has not recognized the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo.\n\n\n"}

It was also occasionally used for or during torture. Because it restricted a person's movements, it was common for people wearing cangues to starve to death as they were unable to feed themselves.\n\nThe word \"cangue\" is French, from the Portuguese \"canga,\" which means yoke, the carrying tool has also been used to the same effect, with the hands tied to each arm of the yoke. Frequently translated as pillory, it was similar to that European punishment except that the board of the cangue was not fixed to a base and had to be carried around by the prisoner.\n\nAlthough there are many different forms, a typical cangue would consist of a large, heavy flat board with a hole in the center large enough for a person's neck. The board consisted of two pieces. These pieces were closed around a prisoner's neck, and then fastened shut along the edges by locks or hinges. The opening in the center was large enough for the prisoner to breathe and eat, but not large enough for a head to slip through. The prisoner was confined in the cangue for a period of time as a punishment. The size and especially weight were varied as a measure of severity of the punishment. The Great Ming Legal Code (大明律) published in 1397 specified that a cangue should be made from seasoned wood and weigh 25, 20 or 15 jīn (roughly 20–33 lb or 9–15 kg) depending on the nature of the crime involved. Often the cangue was large enough that the prisoner required assistance to eat or drink, as his hands could not reach his own mouth.\n"}

Since the 1990s, overall crime in Turkey has been rising. As of 2014, Turkey has seen a 400% rise in \ndrug-related crimes, theft and homicide. In 1994, the number of arrested prisoners was recorded as 38,931; 20 years later, as of the beginning of October 2014, the number of prisoners has reached 152,335. According to the data provided by the Ministry of Justice, the crime rate is growing with each passing day.\n\nAccording to a study, some commonly-expressed views on rape were given to individuals from various professions, who were asked to agree or disagree; results recorded that 33% of the police officers agreed that \"some women deserve rape\", 66% of police officers, as well as nearly 50% of other professional groups except the psychologists about 18% and 27% of psychiatrists, suggested that \"the physical appearance and behaviors of women tempt men to rape.\"\n\nIn 2015, Turkish university student Özgecan Aslan was murdered as she resisted a rape attempt on a minibus in Mersin. Her burnt body was discovered on 13 February. The murder was committed by Turkish minibus driver Ahmet Suphi Altındöken, his father Necmettin Altındöken and his friend Fatih Gökçe. According to Turkish Daily Sabah, Özgcan Aslan became a symbol for Turkish women who are the victims of violence.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Guardian\" reported that 'the rape and torture of Kurdish prisoners in Turkey are disturbingly commonplace'. According to a report from Amnesty International in 2003, Hamdiye Aslan, who accused of supporting the Kurdish separatist group had been detained in Mardin Prison, south-east Turkey, for almost three months in which she was reportedly blindfolded, anally raped with a truncheon, threatened and mocked by officers.\nA June 2008 report by the Turkish Prime Ministry's Human Rights Directorate said that in Istanbul alone there was one honor killing every week, and reported over 1,000 during the previous five years. It added that metropolitan cities were the location of many of these, due to growing immigration to these cities from the East. \n\nIn 2009 a Turkish news agency reported that a 2-day-old boy who was born out of wedlock had been killed for honor. The maternal grandmother of the infant, along with six other persons, including a doctor who had reportedly accepted a bribe to not report the birth, were arrested. The grandmother is suspected of fatally suffocating the infant. The child's mother, 25, was also arrested; she stated that her family had made the decision to kill the child. \n\nIn 2010 a 16-year-old Kurdish girl was buried alive by relatives for befriending boys in Southeast Turkey; her corpse was found 40 days after she went missing. Ahmet Yildiz, 26, a Turkish-Kurdish physics student who represented his country at an international gay conference in the United States in 2008, was shot dead leaving a cafe in Istanbul. It is believed Yildiz was the victim of the country's first gay honor killing.\n\nIn Turkey, persons found guilty of this crime are sentenced to life in prison. There are well documented cases, where Turkish courts have sentenced whole families to life imprisonment for an honor killing. The most recent was on January 13, 2009, where a Turkish Court sentenced five members of the same Kurdish family to life imprisonment for the honor killing of Naile Erdas, 16, who got pregnant as a result of rape.\n\nOver the last ten years, 24391 people have been detained by the police and of those 8602 arrested in 3012 operations against gangs. The gendermarie has likewise detained 10437 people, arrested 6269 in 771 operations. Approximately a third of these arrests took place in 2005-7.\n\nSince the 1980s this issue has been the subject of studies by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, who in 2004 reported \"The legislative and regulatory framework necessary to combat effectively torture and other forms of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials has been put in place; the challenge now is to make sure that all of the provisions concerned are given full effect in practice.\" and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan has declared that there will be \"zero tolerance\" of torture in Turkey.\n\nThere have been a number of rulings against Turkey in the European Court of Human Rights resulting from deaths in custody in the 1990s, \na period when this was raised as an issue by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and others. \n\nIn an August 2007 incident, Nigerian footballer Festus Okey was shot by the police while being detained in Beyoğlu police station. According to the police he had tried to wrestle the gun from the officer and was shot in the ensuing struggle. The Interior Minister Beşir Atalay refused to make a statement, saying \"Questions are asked everywhere, they don't all get a reply\".\n\n"}

It contains tractors and engines built between 1880-1960 by Bukh, Ferguson, Fiat, Ford, and Volvo.\n\nThe museum is owned by Guldborgsund Municipality. After the building sat vacant for some years, the municipality took it over in 1981 and in 1986 moved the Tractor and Engine Museum into it. The new museum was officially opened in 1988. The exhibition area covers about over four floors of the old warehouse building, the three wooden floors supported by 24 columns; and a nearby workshop building. The museum building itself was completed in 1919 as a cleaning station for seeds. It was the first building on Falster to make use of reinforced concrete.\n\nThere are five major collections totalling around 100 tractors and a similar number of engines. The tractor displays include a collection of 38 tractors from the brothers Bent and Knud Nielsen, who were farmers in the area. There are over 200 tractors from the time of the tractor's invention and up until around 1970. There is an almost complete collection of the Danish Bukh tractors, including prototypes, special models and a comprehensive collection of photographs. In addition to the larger collections of Bolinder-Munktell, Volvo, International and Ferguson, there are also several individual rarities. A motor assembly displays almost 100 mainly stationary engines, such Bukh engines, a Holeby engine from 1898 and an International engine from 1925. An extensive library provides instructional and repair books and parts catalogs. A tool assembly showcases agriculture and motorized garden equipment. The Sigvardt collection includes components of Rasmus Sigvardt from nearby Orehoved who was a manufacturer of motors and motorized field and orchard sprayers. Aside from the tractors on display at the museum, there are about 85 tractors stored in three different farms. \n\nThe museum organizes an annual special exhibition. Past themes have includes \"Rare tractors and tractor development\" (2012), \"Rare tractors\" (2011), and \"Swedish tractors\" (2010) which was supplemented by tractors borrowed from a Swedish collector. The museum is open June to September from Tuesday to Sunday (10 am to 4 pm, weekends 10 am to 3 pm). In July and August it is also open on Mondays. The museum also has an area for children where they can play with toy tractors while their parents visit the museum.\n\n"}

The exhibition showed in Perth as a headlining event in the cultural program accompanying the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM), 2011. In collaboration with the Center for Digital Archaeology of Berkeley (CoDA), FORM developed Mira, an online archive of the intangible cultural heritage that was collected throughout the project.\n\nMidland Atelier was established in 2008, at the Midland Railway Workshops in collaboration with the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority (MRA). The MRA was keen to expand the existing wood studio in the site’s pattern shop, and worked with FORM to house a cluster of fine wood artists who had previously been participants in \"Designing Futures\". The Midland Atelier incorporated a range of studio facilities and craft and design disciplines into the site. The Atelier housed fine wood, furniture, jewellery, and photography studios over its lifetime, in addition to a number of exhibitions, events, and artists in residence.\n\nPUBLIC was a three-year project that aimed to 'explore creativity as a catalyst for generating public good – for the wellbeing or benefit of society.' In 2014 the project comprised \"Art in the City\" (Western Australia’s first festival of street and wall-based art), \"Art in the Pilbara\" (a residency program for participating PUBLIC artists), and \"100 Hampton Road\" (a program of creative and professional development for the residents of a lodging house in Fremantle, Western Australia). The initial \"Art in the City\" festival in April 2014 included participation by 45 artists from around the world, who created 35 wall-based works across Perth’s CBD over 10 days. A satellite project \"Dear William, a dedication to William Street\" explored the history of an iconic street within the City of Vincent. In 2015 the project included a symposium on utilising creativity for the public good, and the project expanded to the Wheatbelt, completing large murals on CBH Avon grain silos. In 2016, PUBLIC included PUBLIC Campus at Curtin University, as well as site specific programming in suburban Claremont and the Great Southern region.\n\nIn 2016, FORM opened a new cultural facility and visual arts project space in Claremont, Western Australia. In partnership with LandCorp, FORM renovated the historic Goods Shed located adjacent to the Claremont Railway Station as an exhibition, residency, and event space. Concurrently FORM moved its offices to the Station Masters House on the opposite side of the railway station.\n\n\n"}

Proponents of feminist urbanism advance a perspective that is critical of partriachal political and social structures that they believe have negatively impacted women's lives and have limited female engagement in urban planning. Some feminist urbanism theorists view the urban built environment as fundamentally inhospitable to women. Consequently, the feminist urbanism movement supports strategies for empowering women to plan and develop the future urban environment according to the specific needs of women. \n\nAs a reflection of the diversity of the field of urbanism, theories of feminist urbanism variously studies the impact of female exclusion from urban scholarship, in civic decision making processes, and in the design of urban spaces. Theorists have researched and identified the historical exclusion of women from the fields of architecture, urban planning, and civil engineering. In relation, historians have identified the lack of power and participatory inclusion of women in traditional western societies as being the root cause of these same inhospitable conditions. \n\nTheorists have long studies intersections of behavior and environment and many notable theorists including Michel Foucault and Henre Lefebvre have argued that architecture both reflects and reinforces social norms and patterns of behavior. Lefebvre has gone so far as to argue that \"everything is ontological\" spatial and that physical spaces and their design play a role in constructing identity and ideas of self-hood. \n\nThe theory of feminist urbanism is focused on the ideals of feminism, a diverse field with multiple viewpoints. Feminist urban scholars have suggests that other related movements around improving conditions after racial segregation and more liberal radical planning do not necessarily account for all of the needs of women. Conversely, some feminist scholars have criticized feminist urbanism as reinforcing gender stereotypes with respect to the urban environment particularly when planning for reconstructing urban spaces.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "904073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904073", "title": "Gbe languages", "text": "Gbe languages\n\nThe Gbe languages (pronounced ) form a cluster of about twenty related languages stretching across the area between eastern Ghana and western Nigeria. The total number of speakers of Gbe languages is between four and eight million. The most widely spoken Gbe language is Ewe (3 million speakers in Ghana and Togo), followed by Fon (1.7 million, mainly in Benin). The Gbe languages were traditionally placed in the Kwa branch of the Niger–Congo languages, but more recently have been classified as Volta–Niger languages. They include five major dialect clusters: Ewe, Fon, Aja, Gen (Mina), and Phla–Pherá.\n\nMost of the Gbe peoples came from the east to their present dwelling-places in several migrations between the tenth and the fifteenth century. Some of the Phla–Pherá peoples however are thought to be the original inhabitants of the area who have intermingled with the Gbe immigrants, and the Gen people probably originate from the Ga-Adangbe people in Ghana. In the late eighteenth century, many speakers of Gbe were enslaved and transported to the New World: it is believed that Gbe languages played some role in the genesis of several Caribbean creole languages, especially Haitian Creole.\n\nAround 1840, German missionaries started linguistic research into the Gbe languages. In the first half of the twentieth century, the Africanist Diedrich Hermann Westermann was one of the most prolific contributors to the study of Gbe. The first internal classification of the Gbe languages was published in 1988 by H.B. Capo, followed by a comparative phonology in 1991. The Gbe languages are tonal, Isolating languages and the basic word order is subject–verb–object.\n\nThe Gbe language area is bordered to the west and east by the Volta River in Ghana and the Weme River in Benin. The northern border is between 6 and 8 degrees latitude and the southern border is the Atlantic coast. The area is neighbored mainly by other Kwa languages, except for the east and north-east, where Yorùbá is spoken. To the west, Ga–Dangme, Guang and Akan are spoken. To the north, it is bordered by Adele, Aguna, Akpafu, Lolobi, and Yorùbá.\n\nEstimates of the total number of speakers of Gbe languages vary considerably. Capo (1988) gives a modest estimate of four million, while SIL's Ethnologue (15th edition, 2005) gives eight million. The most widely spoken Gbe languages are Ewe (Ghana and Togo) and Fon (Benin, eastern Togo) at four million and 3 million speakers, respectively. Ewe is a language of formal education for secondary schools and universities in Ghana, and is also used in non-formal education in Togo. In Benin, Aja (740,000 speakers) and Fon were two of the six national languages selected by the government for adult education in 1992.\n\nGreenberg, following Westermann (1952), placed the Gbe languages in the Kwa family of the Niger–Congo languages. The extent of the Kwa branch has fluctuated through the years, and Roger Blench places the Gbe languages in a Volta–Niger branch with former East Kwa languages to their east.\n\nGbe is a dialect continuum. Based on comparative research, Capo (1988) divides it into five clusters, with each cluster consisting of several mutually intelligible dialects. The borders between the clusters are not always distinct. The five clusters are:\n\nAngela Kluge (2011) proposes that the Gbe languages consist of a dialect continuum that can be split into three large clusters.\n\n\nThe dialect continuum as a whole was called 'Ewe' by Westermann, the most influential writer on the cluster, who used the term 'Standard Ewe' to refer to the written form of the language. Other writers have called the Gbe languages as a whole 'Aja', after the name of the local language of the Aja-Tado area in Benin. However, use of this single language's name for the language cluster as a whole was not only not acceptable to all speakers but also rather confusing. Since the establishment of a working group at the West African Languages Congress at Cotonou in 1980, H. B. Capo's name suggestion has been generally accepted: \" 'Gbe\"', which is the word for 'language/dialect' in each of the languages.\n\nKetu, settlement in present-day Benin Republic (formerly known as Dahomey), might be an appropriate starting point for a brief history of the Gbe-speaking peoples. Ewe traditions refer to Ketu as \"Amedzofe\" (\"origin of humanity\") or \"Mawufe\" (\"home of the Supreme Being\"). It is believed that the inhabitants of Ketu were pressed westward by a series of wars between the tenth and the thirteenth century. In Ketu, the ancestors of the Gbe-speaking peoples separated themselves from other refugees and began to establish their own identity.\n\nAttacks between the thirteenth and the fifteenth century drove a large section of the group still further westward. They settled in the ancient kingdom of Tado (also Stado or Stádó) on the Mono river (in present-day Togo). The Tado kingdom was an important state in West Africa up to the late fifteenth century.\n\nIn the course of the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the Notsie (or Notsé, Notsye, Wancé) kingdom was established by emigrants from the Tado kingdom; Notsie would later (around 1500) become the home of another group of migrants from Tado, the Ewe people. Around 1550, emigrants from Tado established the Allada (or Alada) kingdom, which became the center of the Fon people. Tado is also the origin of the Aja people; in fact, the name Aja-Tado (Adja-Tado) is frequently used to refer to their language.\n\nOther peoples that speak Gbe languages today are the Gen people (Mina, Ge) around Anexo, who are probably of Ga and Fante origin, and the Phla and Pherá peoples, some of whom consist of the traditional inhabitants of the area intermingled with early migrants from Tado.\n\nLittle is known of the history of the Gbe languages during the time that only Portuguese, Dutch and Danish traders landed on the Gold Coast (roughly 1500 to 1650). The trade of mostly gold and agricultural goods did not exercise much influence on social and cultural structures of the time. No need was felt to investigate the indigenous languages and cultures; the languages generally used in trade at this time were Portuguese and Dutch. Some loanwords remain from this period, for example \"atrapoe\", 'stairs' from Dutch 'trap' and \"duku\" '(piece of) cloth' from Dutch 'doek' or Danish 'dug'. The few written accounts that stem from this period focus on trade. As more European countries established trade posts in the area, missionaries were sent out. As early as 1658, Spanish missionaries translated the \"Doctrina Christiana\" into the language of Allada, making it one of the earliest texts in any West African language. The Gbe language used in this document is thought to be a somewhat mangled form of Gen.\n\nThe relatively peaceful situation was profoundly changed with the rise of the transatlantic slave trade, which reached its peak in the late eighteenth century when as many as 15 000 slaves per year were exported from the area around Benin as part of a triangular trade between the European mainland, the west coast of Africa and the colonies of the New World (notably the Caribbean). The main actors in this process were Dutch (and to a lesser extent English) traders; captives were supplied mostly by cooperating coastal African states.\n\nThe Bight of Benin, precisely the area where the Gbe languages are spoken, was one of the centers of the slave trade at the turn of the eighteenth century. The export of 5% of the population each year resulted in overall population decline. Moreover, since the majority of the exported captives were male, the slave trade led to an imbalance in the female/male ratio. In some parts of the Slave Coast the ratio reached two adult women for every man. Several wars (sometimes deliberately provoked by European powers in order to divide and rule) further distorted social and economical relations in the area. The lack of earlier linguistic data makes it difficult to trace the inevitable linguistic changes that resulted from this turbulent period.\n\nAround 1850, the transatlantic slave trade had virtually ceased. As the grip of European colonial powers strengthened, slave raiding became prohibited, trading focused on goods once more and the Europeans took it to be their calling to Christianize the colonized parts of Africa. In 1847 the Norddeutsche Missions-Gesellschaft (Bremen) started its work in Keta.\n\nIn 1857, the first Ewe grammar, \"Schlüssel der Ewesprache, dargeboten in den Grammatischen Grundzügen des Anlodialekts\", was published by missionary J. B. Schlegel of the Bremen mission. Five different dialects of Gbe (at that time called the \"Ewé Language-Field\") were already distinguished by Schlegel, notes Robert Needham Cust in his \"Modern Languages of Africa\" (1883). The dialects listed by Cust do not map exactly onto the five subgroups now distinguished by Capo, which is not too surprising since Cust himself admits that he relies on a multitude of often conflicting sources. Fon is in fact listed twice (once as 'the dialect of the province of Dahomé' and once as 'Fogbe').\n\nWhere previous literature consisted mostly of travel journals sometimes accompanied by short word lists, Schlegel's work marked the beginning of a period of prolific lexicographic and linguistic research into the various Gbe languages. Important writers of this period include Johann Gottlieb Christaller (\"Die Volta-Sprachen-Gruppe\", 1888), Ernst Henrici (\"Lehrbuch der Ephe-Sprache\", 1891, actually the first comparative Gbe grammar), J. Knüsli (\"Ewe-German-English Vocabulary\", 1892) and Maurice Delafosse (\"Manuel Dahoméen\" (Fon), 1894).\n\nIn 1902 the missionary Diedrich Hermann Westermann contributed an article titled \"Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Yewe-Sprachen in Togo\" to \"Zeitschrift für Afrikanische und Oceanische Sprachen\". Westermann became one of the most productive and influential writers on the Gbe languages, and his output dominated the Gbe literature and analysis of the first half of the twentieth century. He wrote mainly on the Western Gbe languages, especially on Ewe (though he often used the term 'Ewe' to denote the Gbe dialect continuum as a whole). Among his most important works on Ewe are his \"A Study of the Ewe language\" (1930) and \"Wörterbuch der Ewe-Sprache\" (1954).\n\nFrom 1930 on, publications on various Gbe languages appeared rapidly, the vast majority of them dealing with individual Gbe languages. A significant exception is formed by the extensive comparative linguistic research of Hounkpati B Christophe Capo, which resulted in an internal classification of the Gbe languages and a reconstruction of the proto-Gbe phonology. Much of the comparative research for Capo's classification of the Gbe languages was carried out in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the form of articles on specific phonological developments in various branches of Gbe and, notably, in the form of a unified standard orthography of Gbe. In his \"Renaissance du Gbe\" (1988), the internal classification of Gbe was published in full for the first time. In 1991, Capo published a comparative phonology of Gbe. In this period, Capo also initiated \"Labo Gbe (Int.)\", the 'Laboratory for research on Gbe languages', based in Benin, which has since fostered research and published several collections of papers on the Gbe languages.\n\nIn the early 1990s, SIL International initiated a study to assess which Gbe communities could benefit from existing literacy efforts and whether additional literacy campaigns in some of the remaining communities would be needed. Synchronised linguistic research carried out in the course of this study shed more light on the relations between the various varieties of Gbe. In general, the SIL studies corroborated many of Capo's findings and led to adjustment of some of his more tentative groupings.\n\nThe following phonetic segments are attested in Gbe languages:\n\"Notes\"\n\nNo Gbe language exhibits all of the above forty-two phonetic segments. According to Capo (1991), all of them have the following twenty-three consonants in common: b, m, t, d, ɖ, n, k, g, kp, gb, ɲ, f, v, s, z, χ, ʁ, r, r̃, l, l̃, y, w.\n\nThe following vowels are found in Gbe languages:\n\nIn general, each Gbe variety makes use of a subset of twelve vowels, seven oral and five nasalised. The vowels are attested in all Gbe languages.\n\nNasalization plays an important role in the vowel inventory: every vowel in the Gbe languages occurs in a non-nasalized and a nasalized form. Capo (1991) observes that the degree of nasality of nasal vowels is less when they occur after nasal consonants than after non-nasal ones.\n\nCapo (1981) has argued that nasalization in Gbe languages should be analyzed phonemically as a feature relevant to vowels and not to consonants. This means that nasal vowels are distinct from oral vowels, while nasal and voiced oral stops are treated as predictable variants. For example, non-syllabic nasal consonants are always followed by a nasal vowel, and syllabic nasal consonants are analyzed as reduced forms of consonant–vowel syllables. This analysis is in line with reconstructions of the proto-Volta–Congo language, for which similar proposals have been made.\n\nThe Gbe languages are tonal languages. In general, they have three tone levels, High (H), Mid (M), and Low (L), of which the lower two are not phonemically contrastive. Thus, the basic tonemes of Gbe are 'High' and 'Non-High', where the High toneme may be realised as High or Rising and the Non-High toneme may be realised as Low or Mid. The tones of Gbe nouns are often affected by the consonant of the noun stem. The voicing of this consonant affects the realisation of the Non-High toneme roughly as follows: If the consonant is a voiced obstruent, the Non-High toneme is realised as Low (è-ḏà 'snake') and if the consonant is a voiceless obstruent or a sonorant, the Non-High toneme is realised as Mid (ām̲ē 'person', à-f̱ī 'mouse'). The consonants that induce tonal alternations in this way are sometimes called depressor consonants.\n\nThe basic syllable form of Gbe languages is commonly rendered (C )(C )V(C ), meaning that there at least has to be a nucleus V, and that there are various possible configurations of consonants (C ₋ ). The V position may be filled by any of the vowels or by a syllabic nasal. It is also the location of the tone. While virtually any consonant can occur in the C position, there exist several restrictions on the kind of consonants that can occur in the C and C positions. In general, only liquid consonants may occur as C , while only nasals occur in the C position.\n\nMost verbs in Gbe languages have one of the basic syllable forms. Gbe nominals are generally preceded by a nominal prefix consisting of a vowel (cf. the Ewe word ', 'tooth'). The quality of this vowel is restricted to the subset of non-nasal vowels. In some cases the nominal prefix is reduced to schwa or lost: the word for 'fire' is \"izo\" in Phelá, ' in Wací-Ewe and \"\" in Pecí-Ewe. The nominal prefix can be seen as a relic of a typical Niger–Congo noun class system.\n\nThe Gbe languages are isolating languages, and as such express many semantic features by lexical items. Of a more agglutinative nature are the commonly used periphrastic constructions. In contrast to Bantu languages, a major branch of the Niger–Congo language family, Gbe languages have very little inflectional morphology. There is for example no subject–verb agreement whatsoever in Gbe, no gender agreement, and no inflection of nouns for number. The Gbe languages make extensive use of a rich system of tense/aspect markers.\n\nReduplication is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word, or part of it, is repeated. The Gbe languages, like most other Kwa languages, make extensive use of reduplication in the formation of new words, especially in deriving nouns, adjectives and adverbs from verbs. Thus in Ewe, the verb \"lã́\", 'to cut', is nominalised by reduplication, yielding \"lãlã́\", 'the act of cutting'. Triplication is used to intensify the meaning of adjectives and adverbs, e.g. Ewe \"ko\" 'only' → \"kokooko\" 'only, only, only'.\n\nThe basic word order of Gbe clauses is generally subject–verb–object, except in the imperfective tense and some related constructions. The Gbe languages, notably Ewe, Fon and Anlo, played a role in the genesis of several Caribbean creole languages—Haitian Creole for example is classifiable as having a French vocabulary with the syntax of a Gbe language.\n\nThe Gbe languages do not have a marked distinction between tense and aspect. The only tense that is expressed by a simple morphological marker in Gbe languages is the \"future tense\". The future marker is \"ná\" or \"a\", as can be seen from the examples below.\nOther tenses are arrived at by means of special time adverbs or by inference from the context, and this is where the tense/aspect distinction becomes blurred. For example, what is sometimes referred to as \"perfective aspect\" in Gbe blends with the notion of past tense since it expresses an event with a definite endpoint, \"located in the past\" (see example sentences below).\n\nFocus, which is used to draw attention to a particular part of the utterance, to signify contrast or to emphasize something, is expressed in Gbe languages by leftward movement of the focused element and by way of a focus marker \"wɛ́\" (Gungbe, Fongbe), \"yé\" (Gengbe) or \"é\" (Ewegbe), suffixed to the focused element. \n\nQuestions can be constructed in various ways in Gbe languages. A simple declarative sentence can be turned into an interrogative utterance by the use of the question marker \"à\" at the end of the sentence. Another way of forming questions is by using question words. These so-called \"question word questions\" are much akin to focus constructions in Gbe. The question word is found at the beginning of the sentence, as is the focus marker. The close relationship to focus is also clear from the fact that in Gbe, a sentence cannot contain a question word and a focused element simultaneously.\n\nTopicalization, the signalling of the subject that is being talked about, is achieved in Gbe languages by the move of the topicalized element to the beginning of the sentence. In some Gbe languages, a topic marker is suffixed to the topicalized element. In other Gbe languages the topic has to be \"definite\". A topicalized element precedes the focused element in a sentence containing both.\n\nNegation is expressed in various ways in the Gbe languages. In general, three methods of negation can be distinguished: Languages like Gungbe express negation by a preverbal marker \"má\"; Fongbe-type languages express negation either like Gungbe, or with a sentence-final marker \"ã\"; and languages like Ewegbe require both the preverbal marker \"mé\" and a sentence-final marker \"o\".\n\nGbe languages share an areal feature found in many languages of the Volta basin, the serial verb construction. This means that two or more verbs can be juxtaposed in one clause, sharing the same subject, lacking conjunctive markings, resulting in a meaning that expresses the consecutive or simultaneous aspect of the actions of the verbs. \n\n"}

The 1979 Soviet census showed 101,057 Germans in the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic (2.9% of the population), while the 1989 census showed 101,309 (2.4%).\n\nAfter Kyrgyzstan gained independence in 1991, there was a significant outflow of ethnic Germans to Germany, due to the relatively liberal German nationality law which granted citizenship to anyone with proof of German ancestry. A 1993 survey found that 85% of the Germans in Kyrgyzstan intended to emigrate; among those, the most popular destination by far was Germany (80%), with Russia running a distant second at 6%. By the time of Kyrgyzstan's 1999 census, just 21,471 (0.4% of the population) remained. German diplomatic officials in Kyrgyzstan were quoted in 2009 as stating that number has declined even further over the following decade, to perhaps just 10,000. This was supported by the 2009 census, which found just 9,487 Germans remaining (0.18% of the population). However, there are signs that the exodus may be coming to an end. Facing difficulties integrating Russian-speaking Germans from the former Soviet Union, the German government tightened their immigration requirements; furthermore, most ethnic Germans who hope to leave Kyrgyzstan have already done so. In 2007, only 196 Germans in Kyrgyzstan were granted immigration permits by the German embassy; that number fell further to 111 in 2008.\n\nThe first German settlements in Kyrgyzstan were near Talas: Nikolaipol, Keppental, Gradental, Orlovka and Dmitrovskoye. In the late 1920s, they moved towards the Chuy Valley, in the vicinity of Frunze (now Bishkek), where they established a number of new village-suburbs, including Bergtal (Rotfront), Fridenfeld, and Luxemburg. Others lived in Kant and Tokmok. However, in the exodus of the 1990s, the German villages emptied out, and there are no longer any compact settlements of Germans in the country.\n\nThe ethnic Germans of Kyrgyzstan tend to trace their roots to western parts of Germany near the border with the Netherlands, and as such tend to speak varieties of Low German. However, many youth show language shift towards Russian, which they use for communicating with peers of other ethnicities. There is a Bishkek branch of the Goethe-Institut, which promotes German culture and the teaching of the German language; the local head of the Institut is herself an ethnic German born in Kyrgyzstan, who emigrated with her parents in 1978 but then returned to the country nearly three decades later to take up her present post. However, the study of the German language as a second language has been losing popularity even among ethnic German youth, as Chinese and English become of greater economic importance instead.\n\nIn the southern city of Jalal-Abad, local ethnic Germans formed the Hope German Cultural Center in 1996. Four Congresses of German Youth of Kyrgyzstan (съезд немецкой молодежи Киргизии) have been held in the country; however, the most recent, in 2010, attracted only 50 participants. The government of Germany provides some monetary support to German organisations in Kyrgyzstan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15542571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15542571", "title": "Liwa (music)", "text": "Liwa (music)\n\nLīwa ( / ALA-LC: \"laywah\") is a traditional dance of African origin performed in Eastern Arabia (Arab states of the Persian Gulf), mainly within communities of descendants of people from the Swahili Coast (Tanzania and Zanzibar). It is also performed by the African-descended Sheedi community, as well as the Baloch of Pakistan's Makran Coast and Karachi area.\n\nA large number of male participants arrange themselves into a circle, which is anchored by one or several drum players. A man paces in the middle of the group playing a simple reed instrument called \"mizmar\" or \"surnai\", whose plaintive sharp sound reminds the listener of an oboe. The circle claps and dances in place, while individuals join a line which rhythmically paces around the inside of the circle. The Liwa is a more casual dance than the others, and can be performed with great spirit and banter from the young men who usually take part.\n\nThe three backing drums for this dance are the \"shindo\", the \"jabwah\", and the \"jasser\". More recently, a fourth drum—known as the Peeper—was added. This drummer plays a dominant role, which gives him plenty of opportunity for a virtuoso performance.\n\nThe \"mizmar\" has an oboe-like sound and produces a haunting melody, which is lent particular poignancy by the eastern tonic scale to which it is tuned. Like the oboe, it is made in two pieces, with a double reed fitted into the second piece. The best instruments these days are made of African hardwood in Mombassa and Dar Es Salaam. Their cost can be as high as $2,000.\n\nThe Liwa begins with a \"mizmar\" solo of about six minutes in slow tempo. The drums join in, followed by the ten dancers/singers, and gradually the pace increases to reach a spectacular swirl of activity. The whole dance takes about 25 minutes and both men and women can be involved in a performance.\n\nThe singing is always performed in Swahili—the native language of Tanzania and Zanzibar. These were both major trading partners with the Persian Gulf in centuries past, and have lent their language and culture to influence this fascinating dance.\n\nIt is especially performed on Eid and other celebrations.\n\n\n"}

He was a local legal institution who nurtured the careers of hundreds of young lawyers, with two dozen appointed to state and federal judgeships, and one seated on the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nFrost was born in New York City, but his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida when he was seven years old. He was a 1949 graduate of Jacksonville's Landon High School, where he was named valedictorian. He received a degree in business from the University of Florida in 1953, the same year he married his wife, Shirley. He attended law school at the University of Miami before serving two years as an officer in the United States Army First Infantry during the Korean War. After leaving the Army, he completed his law degree at the University of Florida College of Law. He was admitted to the Florida Bar on November 6, 1958. and worked briefly in a Jacksonville private practice.\n\nIn 1959, then-county solicitor Lacy Mahon Jr. hired Frost as a part-time prosecutor. After Edward M. Booth was elected County Solicitor, he retained Frost on the staff, as well as Ed Austin. Frost first became acquainted with Austin in 1951 at the University of Florida when the former was a student and the latter was a teacher. A few years later, Frost was a First Lieutenant at Fort Sill, Oklahoma when Austin attended Officer Candidate School. They also attended law school together.\n\nIn the 1963 \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that defendants charged with felonies (besides murder) were also entitled to legal representation by the State. In response, the Florida Legislature established the office of Public Defender, and Governor Farris Bryant appointed Ed Austin as Jacksonville's first public defender.\n\nAustin asked Frost if he would be interested in changing sides. Frost said \"yes\" and he became Austin's chief assistant. Frost commented, \n\nI never got a big bang out of putting people in jail. I always felt there was some good in every person – even though you had to find it in some of them. I also had prosecuted many people who didn’t have representation and I knew their sentences would have been more lenient if they could have had an attorney.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the state attorney handled capital cases and grand jury indictments, while the county solicitor was responsible for all other cases. When Austin resigned to run for State Attorney in 1968, \nFrost was invited to change sides again, but he declined and was appointed to fill Austin's remaining term by Governor Claude Kirk. Frost was elected public defender later that year and retained the post until he retired in January 2005, running unopposed 9 times. Frost explained how that happened: \n\"I was a Democrat in the mostly Republican Fourth Judicial Circuit. When Don Brewer was the head of the Republican Party he told me I was doing a fine job and I would run unopposed.\"\nFrost was also asked to help establish other public defender offices across the country.\n\nFrost and his wife Shirley were married for 47 years and raised two children: Louis O. Frost IV and Deborah. He was a long-time member of Rotary International, and served as president of the Arlington Rotary Club. He was also active with Jacksonville's Morocco Temple, elected \"Illustrious Potentate\" in 1987, and a Master Mason, 33rd degree Scottish Rite, and a Jester. \nUpon his retirement, Frost was interviewed by the \"Florida Times-Union\": \"It has been rewarding to see people whose careers I've helped and also to see people that we've defended turn the corner and turn their lives around. Those are the rewards that you never see, and those are the rewards that I've cherished.\"\n\nFrost was diagnosed with stomach cancer and had surgery in March 2004 to remove an abdominal tumor, followed by 25 doses of chemotherapy. Before treatment, Frost had a slim body, and during chemo, his weight dropped to 105 pounds. He realized that he would not be able to return to work, and retirement was his only option. At his retirement party, delayed because of the cancer treatment, he commented, \n\nYes, it was difficult. The chemo really knocked me down, but I guess they almost have to kill you before you can start in your recovery. Everything is great, wonderful right now. I’m in remission and there have been no reoccurrences since my surgery. I’m blessed. I’m surrounded by the people I love.\n\nMore than 300 friends and colleagues attended a retirement celebration in his honor on February 24, 2005. They included judges, lawyers and politicians in the northeast Florida legal community, many of whom offered speeches in tribute.\n\nState Attorney Harry Shorstein said, \"Lou was your quintessential moral, ethical, caring person. The law can at times be very contentious, but Lou was always a gentleman.\"\n\nChief Circuit Judge Donald Moran commented, \"He was so well-respected throughout the state of Florida, not only for his civic work but as a lawyer. He was a humble person, a gentleman's gentleman.\"\n\nThe cancer returned however, and four years after he was diagnosed, Frost died of complications after a long hospitalization.\n\nIn 1975, Frost was honored by the National Legal Aid & Defender Association with their distinguished \"Reginald Heber Smith Award\".\n\nHe received the Mary L. Singleton Justice, Peace and Social Harmony Award in 2001, and the D.W. Perkins Bar Association recognized him in 2004 for his \"trail-blazing\" dedication to hiring African-American lawyers.\n\nIn 2006, the Florida Public Defenders Association named him recipient of the \"L. Clayton Nance Award\". Frost commented, \"It is a distinct honor to be recognized in the same group with former governors Farris Bryant and Leroy Collins and State Supreme Court Justices (B. K.) Roberts and Adkins and Sandy D'Alemberte. It is overwhelming for me. To be listed among those people as worthy of this award is the pinnacle of my career.\"\n\nThat same year, the Criminal Law Section of The Florida Bar bestowed the Selig Goldin Award in recognition of his distinguished career.\n"}

He continued to work steadily for over 60 years. He is best known for his title role in the German television series \"Graf Yoster\".\n\nLukas Amann's mother was a singer and his father a painter. After he saw Schiller's \"The Robbers\" at grammar school in Basel, he aspired to be an actor. Starting in 1933 he attended the acting school of Max Reinhardt in Berlin. In 1934, he left Germany with Heinrich Gretler for Switzerland. Because of his Jewish mother, he was discriminated against even in Switzerland. In the beginning he worked in St. Gallen and later at the Schauspielhaus Zürich with Therese Giehse. In 1948, he participated under Kurt Hirschfeld in the role of the attorney in the premiere of \"Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti\". After World War II, Ammann belonged to the Ensemble of the theatre Kleine Freiheit in Munich. Guest performances and tours led him to stages in Austria, Scandinavia and the USA.\n\nAmmann began his film career in the 1939 Swiss movie \"Constable Studer\" after the novel of Friedrich Glauser, starring Heinrich Gretler. Beginning in the 1950s, he was successful especially on German Television. In 1961, he played in the series \"Gestatten, mein Name ist Cox\" with Günter Pfitzmann and Paul Edwin Roth. In 1963, he was one of the jurors in \"\", which was a remake of the American film \"12 Angry Men\" for German television.\n\nIn 1966, Ammann played in the first color-TV series \"Adrian der Tulpendieb\". On top of that he appeared in series like \"Das Kriminalmuseum\", \"Die fünfte Kolonne\", \"Der Forellenhof\" and \"Der Kommissar\". In 1973, the horror movie \"Mark of the Devil Part II\" depicted him as tortured to death.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1977 he achieved great popularity in his most famous role in the German detective series \"Graf Yoster\", where he played the main part of the same name.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000, Ammann played a family patriarch in the television series \"Die Fallers\". In 1998, he played a purported survivor of the Holocaust in Dani Levy's film \"Meschugge\". In 2005, at age 92, he played Abi Golstein in Micha Lewinsky's Swiss short film \"Herr Goldstein\". It won an award for best Swiss short film at the Locarno International Film Festival. Ammann lent his voice in German dubbing Peter Sellers (in \"John and Julie\", 1955) and Lucky Luke (in the animated film \"Daisy Town\", 1971).\n\nIn 2013, he worked again, aged 101, with the director Ronnie R. Vogt on the movie \"Reunion Solitaire\".\n\nLukas Ammann lived in Munich. After two failed marriages, he married German soprano Liselotte Ebnet in 1959; she died in 2009. As of 2015, he still ran his household by himself and also drove his car. He died in May 2017 at the age of 104 from complications from surgery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21122396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21122396", "title": "Me generation", "text": "Me generation\n\nThe \"Me\" generation in the United States is a term referring to the baby boomers generation and the self-involved qualities that some people associate with it. The 1970s were dubbed the \"Me\" decade by writer Tom Wolfe; Christopher Lasch was another writer who commented on the rise of a culture of narcissism among the younger generation of that era. The phrase caught on with the general public, at a time when \"self-realization\" and \"self-fulfillment\" were becoming cultural aspirations to which young people supposedly ascribed higher importance than social responsibility.\n\nThe cultural change in the United States during the 1970s that was experienced by the baby boomers is complex. The 1960s are remembered as a time of political protests, radical experimentation with new cultural experiences (the Sexual Revolution, happenings, mainstream awareness of Eastern religions). The Civil Rights Movement gave rebellious young people serious goals to work towards. Cultural experimentation was justified as being directed toward spiritual or intellectual enlightenment. The mid to late 1970s, in contrast, were a time of increased economic crisis and disillusionment with idealistic politics among the young, particularly after the resignation of Richard Nixon and the end of the Vietnam War. Unapologetic hedonism became acceptable among the young, expressed in the Disco music popular at the time.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Tom Wolfe and Christopher Lasch were speaking out critically against the culture of narcissism. These criticisms were widely repeated throughout American popular media.\n\nThe development of a youth culture focusing so heavily on self-fulfillment was also perhaps a reaction against the traits that characterized the older generation, which had grown up during the Great Depression. That generation had learned values associated with self-sacrifice. The deprivations of the Depression had taught that generation to work hard, save money and not spend it; to cherish family and community ties. Loyalty to institutions, traditional religious faiths, and other common bonds were what that generation considered to be the cultural foundations of their country. Baby boomers gradually abandoned those values in large numbers, a development that was entrenched during the 1970s.\n\nThe 1970s have been described as a transitional era when the self-help of the 1960s became self-gratification, and eventually devolved into the selfishness of the 1980s.\n\nHealth and exercise fads, New Age spirituality such as Scientology, discos and hot tub parties, self-help programs such as EST (Erhard Seminars Training), and the growth of the self-help book industry became identified with the baby boomers during 1970s. Human potential, emotional honesty, \"finding yourself', and new therapies became hallmarks of the culture. The marketing of lifestyle products, eagerly consumed by baby boomers with disposable income during the 1970s, became an inescapable part of the culture. Revlon's marketing staff did research into young women's cultural values during the 1970s, and the research revealed that young women were striving to compete with men in the workplace and to express themselves as independent individuals. Revlon launched the \"lifestyle\" perfume \"Charlie\", with marketing aimed at glamorizing the values of the new 1970s woman, and it became the world's best-selling perfume.\n\nThe introspection of the baby boomers and their focus on self-fulfillment has been examined in a serious light in pop culture. Films such as \"An Unmarried Woman\" (1978), \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" (1979), \"Ordinary People\" (1980) and \"The Big Chill\" (1983) brought the inner struggles of baby boomers to a wide audience. The self-absorbed side of 1970s life was given a sharp and sometimes poignant satirization in \"Manhattan\" (1979). More acerbic lampooning came in \"Shampoo\" (1975) and \"Private Benjamin\" (1980). The Me generation has also been satirized in retrospect, as the generation called \"Generation X\" reached adulthood, for example, in \"Parenthood\" (1989). \"Forrest Gump\" (1994) summed up the decade with Gump's cross-country jogging quest for meaning during the 1970s, complete with a tracksuit, which was worn as much as a fashion statement as an athletic necessity during the era.\n\nThe satirization of the Me generation's me-first attitude perhaps reached its peak with the television sitcom \"Seinfeld\", which did not include conscious moral development for its baby boomer characters, rather the opposite. Nor did it have plots with lessons to teach its audience. It was a \"show about nothing\", and its creators held this position deliberately.\n\nThe term \"Me generation\" has persisted over the decades so is connected to the baby boomers generation. Some writers, however, have also named the Millennials the Me Generation or Generation Me, while Elspeth Reeve in The Atlantic noted that narcissism is a symptom of youth in most generations. The 1970s were also an era of rising unemployment among the young, continuing erosion of faith in conventional social institutions, and political and ideological aimlessness for many. This was the environment that precipitated gravitation toward Punk rock among America's disaffected young people. By 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected President, a growing number of America's baby boomers had also begun turning toward conservative political and cultural priorities.\n\nAt the same time, the realities behind the label have not escaped notice. As Eastern religions and rituals such as yoga grew during the 1970s, at least one writer observed a New Age corruption of the popular understanding of \"realization\" taught by Neo-Vedantic practitioners, away from spiritual realization and towards \"self-realization\". The leading edge of the baby boomers, who were counter-culture \"hippies\" and political activists during the 1960s, have been referred to sympathetically as the \"Now generation\", in contrast to the Me generation.\n\n"}
{"id": "38421687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38421687", "title": "Mediterraneanism", "text": "Mediterraneanism\n\nMediterraneanism is an ideology that claims that there are distinctive characteristics that Mediterranean cultures have in common. \n\nGiuseppe Sergi asserted that the Mediterranean race was \"the greatest race...derived neither from the black nor white people...an autonomous stock in the human family.\" Italian Fascism initially adhered strongly to a similar version of Mediterraneanism that claimed a bond existed between all Mediterranean cultures and Mediterranean peoples, often placing Mediterranean people and cultures above other cultures. This form of Mediterraneanism was in stark contrast to the then-popular Nordicist racial theory common in Northwestern, Central and Northern Europe which categorized South European or Mediterranean people as inferior to Nordic people.\n\nItalian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi claimed that the Mediterranean race was \"the greatest race in the world\". He defined it as \"the finest brunet race which has appeared in Europe…derived neither from the black nor white peoples, but constitut[ing] an autonomous stock in the human family.\". Sergi claimed that the Mediterranean Race probably historically spoke a Hamitic language related to the language of the prehistoric Egyptians, Iberians, and Libyans. Sergi noted that the Roman Empire led to the spread of Mediterranean civilization across Europe and thus contemporary European civilization was bound by ancestry to the Mediterranean race.\n\nSergi rejected Nordicism's claims of Nordic peoples being strongly Aryan, saying that Aryans were not Nordic in appearance. Instead he claimed that Nordics were \"Aryanized Euroafricans\", and that the Nordic race is related to Mediterranean race. Sergi responded to typical Nordicist claims of superiority of Nordics over Mediterraneans, by saying that the reason for the lack of wealth or progress in Latin countries as compared with countries of Northern Europe was because the Aryans of the North, including northern Italians, living in frigid climates had developed close-knit groups that allowed them to survive in that environment, as such they became more disciplined, productive civic-minded than southern Italians. Because of this, Sergi claimed that the northern Italians, whom he identified as having significant Aryan heritage, were more advanced than southern Italians. However Sergi rejected claims that Aryans who were a Euroasian people were responsible for founding Greco-Latin civilization. Sergi described the original Aryans in Europe in a negative manner: \"The Aryans were savages when they invaded Europe: they destroyed in part the superior civilization of the Neolithic populations, and could not have created the Greco-Latin civilization\". Sergi claimed that the only contribution by the ancient Aryans to European civilization was Indo-European languages. He claimed that the ancient Aryans interbred with the Mediterranean race north of the Po Valley but declined south of it and became insignificant south of Rome.\n\nSergi claimed the Nordics had made no substantial contribution to pre-modern civilization, noting that \"in the epoch of Tacitus the Germans ... remained barbarians as in prehistoric times\". He claimed that the Romans were unable to Romanize the Germans because the Germans were averse to the Romans' civilizing influence. He rejected Germanic scholars' claims that Germans were the saviors of a decadent post-Roman Italy. Instead Sergi claimed that the Germans were responsible for bringing forward the Dark Ages in the Medieval period and that the Germans of the Medieval period were known for \"delinquency, vagabondage, and ferocity\".\nC. G. Seligman supported Mediterraneanist claims, stating \"it must, I think, be recognized that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievement to its credit than any other, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilization, certainly before 1000 B.C. (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.\"\n\nFrench historian Fernand Braudel in the 1920s invoked the conception of the Mediterraneanism including claims of Mediterranean universalism to justify French colonialism in Algeria. Braudel had entered his doctrinal studies in the 1920s at the precise time when the issue of Mediterranean unity was being fiercely debated. Braudel supported the pro-unity argument. The argument for Mediterranean unity justified French colonialism in Algeria and viewed the Berbers in a place of privilege amongst the peoples of Africa, as retainers of the lost Roman legacy in Africa. It was claimed that if the Berbers could be culturally separated from the Arabo-Islamic surrounding culture, that the Berbers would become natural allies of the French through their Mediterranean heritage that would challenge anti-colonial sentiment.\n\nAt first, Italian Fascism promoted a variant of Mediterraneanism that, like Sergi's strain of Mediterraneanism, held that Mediterranean people and cultures shared a common historical and cultural bond. Initially, this variant mostly avoided explicit racial connotations; its followers often rejected biological racism and instead stressed the importance of the cultural aspects rather than the racial aspects of the Mediterranean peoples. Implicitly, however, this form of Mediterraneanism posited the Mediterranean race and Mediterranean cultures as superior to other groups, including the Northwestern European, Germanic, and Nordic people, and it arose partially as a response to Nordicism, a racial theory popular at the time among Northwestern European and Germanic racial theorists, as well as racial theorists of Northwestern European descent in countries such as the United States, that viewed non-Nordic people, including Italians and other Mediterranean people, as racially subordinate to the Nordic, Aryan, or Germanic peoples. \nIn a 1921 speech in Bologna, Benito Mussolini stated that \"Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan and Mediterranean race\". In this speech Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the Indo-European Aryan race, in the sense of people of an Indo-European heritage rather than in the more famous Nordicist sense that was promoted by the Nazis. Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations, and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors. Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically \"pure\" races existed in modern times.\nItalian Fascism strongly rejected the Nordicist conception of the Aryan race that idealized \"pure\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as fair skin, blond hair and blue eyes, traits uncommon among Mediterranean and Italian people and the often olive-skinned members of the so-called \"Mediterranean race.\" The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate. Nordicism and biological racism were often considered incompatible with the early Italian fascist philosophy; Nordicism inherently subordinated Italians and other Mediterranean people beneath the Germans and Northwestern Europeans in its proposed racial hierarchy, and early Italian fascists, including Mussolini, often viewed race as a cultural and political invention rather than a biological reality or saw physical race as something that could be overcome through culture. In a speech given in Bari in 1934, Mussolini reiterated his attitude toward Nordicism: \"Thirty centuries of history allow us to look with supreme pity on certain doctrines which are preached beyond the Alps by the descendants of those who were illiterate when Rome had Caesar, Virgil and Augustus\".\n\nFrom the late 1930s through World War II, the Italian Fascists became divided in their stance on Mediterraneanism. Originally, Nazi-like Nordicist racial theories were found among only a very small number of fringe Italian Fascists, mostly Germanophiles, anti-Semites, anti-intellectuals, and Northern Italians who regarded themselves to have Nordic or Germanic Lombard racial heritage, and Nordicism and Nazi Aryanism remained at odds with Italian Fascist theories on the greatness of the Mediterranean people. However, by 1938, as the alliance between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany became stronger, and as Nazi German policies and theories increasingly influenced Italian Fascist thought, many Italian Fascists began to embrace a new form of Mediterraneanism, a variant that mixed Nazi Nordicism with original Mediterraneanism. Unlike other forms of Mediterraneanism, this form based its racial view on Nazism and asserted that Italians were part of the \"white race\" or \"white Aryan race\" and utilized white supremacism to justify colonialism.\n\nIn 1938, mere months before creating the Pact of Steel alliance with Nazi Germany, the Fascist government created the Italian Racial Laws and officially but gradually recognized and embraced the racial myth of Italians having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent. According to the \"Diary\" of Giuseppe Bottai, in a meeting with Fascist Party members, Mussolini declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism. Both Italian historian Renzo De Felice in his book \"La storia degli ebrei italiani sotto il fascismo\" (1961) and William Shirer in \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" (1960) suggest that Mussolini enacted the Italian Racial Laws and turned towards Nazi racial theories partially to appease his Nazi German allies, rather than to satisfy a genuine anti-Semitic sentiment among the Italian people. \n\nWith the rise in influence of pro-Nordicist Nazi Germany in Europe, and as the Fascist Italian regime sought unity with Nazi Germany, the Fascist regime gave Italian Nordicists prominent positions in the National Fascist Party (PNF), which aggravated the original Mediterraneanists in the party. Prominent Nordicists such as Julius Evola rejected Mediterraneanism and, in particular, Evola denounced Sergi's association of Europeans with Africans as \"dangerous\". Evola rejected biological determinism for race but was a supporter of spiritual Nordicism. In direct contradiction of the earlier or original forms of Mediterraneanism that embraced the idea of a shared origin or culture among all people of the Mediterranean, the \"Manifesto of Racial Scientists\" (1938) declared that Mediterranean Europeans were distinct from Mediterranean Africans and Mediterranean Asians and rejected claims that European Mediterraneans were related to the Mediterranean Semitic or Hamitic peoples. \n\nIn 1941, the PNF's Mediterraneanists, through the influence of Giacomo Acerbo, put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race. However these efforts were challenged by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist Alberto Luchini as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested with Evola's spiritual Nordicism in late 1941. Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist \"Manifesto of the Racial Scientists\". The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group, and condemned the \"Manifesto\" for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the \"Manifesto\" \"constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country\". Furthermore, the Council denounced the \"Manifesto\" for \"implicitly\" crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the Lombards for having \"a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance\". The High Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the ancient Greeks and Romans in comparison with the ancient Germanic tribes made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Germans.\n\n"}
{"id": "454605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=454605", "title": "Meena", "text": "Meena\n\nThe Meena () is a tribe found mainly in the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh regions of India. Its name is also transliterated as \"Meenanda\" or \"Mina\". The Meenas claim connection to the Matsya avatar of Vishnu, and the ancient Matsya Kingdom.\n\nThe word \"Meena\" is derived from \"Meen\", the Sanskrit word for \"fish\", and the Meenas claim a mythological descent from the Matsya avatar, or fish incarnation, of Vishnu. They also claim to be descendants of the people of the Matsya Kingdom, which flourished in the 6th century B.C. The historian Pramod Kumar notes that it is likely that the tribes living in the ancient Matsya kingdom were called Meena but it cannot be said with certainty that there is anything common between them and the modern Meenas. They are considered to be adivasi (aboriginal people).\n\nThe Meenas ruled at certain places in Rajasthan till they were overpowered by invading Rajputs. From Meenas the Bundi was captured by Rao Dewa (A.D. 1342), Dhundhar by Kachhwaha Rajputs and Chopoli fell to the Muslim rulers. Kota, Jhalawar, Karauli and Jalore were the other areas of earlier Meena influence where they were forced to surrender ultimately.\n\nNandini Sinha Kapur, a historian who has studied early India, notes that the oral traditions of the Meenas were developed from the early 19th century AD in an attempt to reconstruct their identity. She says of this process, which continued throughout the 20th century, that \"The Minas try to furnish themselves a respectable present by giving themselves a \"glorious past\"\". In common with the people of countries such as Finland and Scotland, the Meenas found it necessary to invent tradition through oral accounts, one of the primary uses of which is recognised by both historians and sociologists as being \"social protest against injustices, exploitation and oppression, a \"raison d'être\" that helps to retrieve the image of a community.\" Kapur notes that the Meenas not merely lack a recorded history of their own but also have been depicted in a negative manner both by medieval Persian accounts and records of the colonial period. From medieval times through to the British Raj, references to the Meenas describe them as violent, plundering criminals and an anti-social ethnic tribal group.\n\nThe Raj colonial administration came into existence in 1858, following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 which caused the government of Britain to decide that leaving colonial administration in the hands of the East India Company was a recipe for further discontent. In an attempt to create an orderly administration through a better understanding of the populace, the Raj authorities instituted various measures of classifying the people of India. One such measure was the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, under the provisions of which the Meenas were placed. The community remained stigmatised for many years, notably by influential officials of the Raj such as Herbert Hope Risley and Denzil Ibbetson, and were sometimes categorised as animists and as a hill tribe similar to the Bhils. The Meenas remained an officially designated criminal tribe until 1952, three years after the Act had been repealed. Mark Brown has examined the impact and issues of the Meena community during British rule and the change in their status from being a higher social group to a criminal tribe.\n\nMeenas have better rights for women in many respects compared to many other Hindu castes.\n\nThe Meena fall into the Scheduled Tribe category in the state of Rajasthan and the majority of them are classified as being Hindu, but in Madhya Pradesh Meena are recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in Sironj Tehsil, Vidisha, while in the other 44 districts of the state they are categorised as Other Backward Classes. It has been proposed that the Meenas be fully recognised as a Scheduled Tribe in Madhya Pradesh. The proposal is being considered by the Government of India. In Uttar Pradesh, Meena are considered migrated from Rajasthan and have been living in western districts of Mathura, Sambhal and Budaun since many generations. At par their origin they are granted a Scheduled tribe status in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn Rajasthan, the Meena caste members oppose the entry of Gurjars into Scheduled Tribe fold, fearing that their own share of Scheduled Tribe reservation benefits will be eroded.\n\nThey celebrate Meenesh Jayanti on the third day of the Chaitra month's Shukla paksha.\n\nThe Meena tribe is divided into several clans and sub-clans (\"adakh\"s), which are named after their ancestors. Some of the \"adakh\"s include Ariat, Ahari, Katara, Kalsua, Kharadi, Damore, Ghoghra, Dali, Doma, Nanama, Dadore, Manaut, Charpota, Mahinda, Rana, Damia, Dadia, Parmar, Phargi, Bamna, Khat, Hurat, Hela, Bhagora, and Wagat.\n\nBhil Meena is another sub-division among the Meenas. As part of a sanskritisation process, some Bhils present themselves as Meenas, who hold a higher socio-economic status compared to the Bhil tribal people.\n\nA sub-group known as \"Ujwal Meena\" (also \"Ujala Meena\" or \"Parihar Meena\") seek higher status, and claim to be Rajputs, thus distinguishing themselves from the Bhil Meenas. They follow vegetarianism, unlike other Meenas whom they designated as \"Mailay Meena\".\n\nOther prevalent social groupings are Zamindar Meena and the Chaukidar Meena. The Zamindar Meena, comparatively well-off, are those who surrendered to powerful Rajput invaders and settled on the lands believe to be granted by the Rajputs. Those who did not surrender to Rajput rule and kept on waging guerrilla warfare are called the Chaukidar Meena.\n\n"}

This expansion was (and continues to be) intimately related to the socio-cultural experiences of the inhabitants of Minde. For example, names and nicknames of well-known persons from Minde and the neighbouring areas were used as lexemes to express physical or psychological characteristics, as these characteristics were salient for those persons. This method of lexical formation can be explained by the fact that Minde, due to its geographical isolation, is a small and close knit community, where everyone knows one another. Therefore, using names of persons as a means to express the characteristics associated to them was immediately understood amongst members of the speech community; this was not an obstacle to effective communication.\n\nThe Interdiciplinary Centre for Social and Language Documentation (CIDLes), an institution dedicated to the research and documentation of endangered languages in Europe and the development of language technologies for lesser-used languages, is now working on the linguistic documentation of Minderico and, together with the speech community, on its revitalization.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35898355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35898355", "title": "Mortlockese language", "text": "Mortlockese language\n\nMortlockese (Kapsen Mwoshulók), also known as Mortlock or Nomoi, is a language that belongs to the Chuukic group of Micronesian languages in the Federated States of Micronesia spoken primarily in the Mortlock Islands (Nomoi (Lower Mortlock) Islands and the Upper Mortlock Islands). It is nearly intelligible with Satawalese, with an 18 percent intelligibility and an 82 percent lexical similarity, and Puluwatese, with a 75 percent intelligibility and an 83 percent lexical similarity. The language today has become mutually intelligible with Chuukese, though marked with a distinct Mortlockese accent. Linguistic patterns show that Mortlockese is converging with Chuukese since Mortlockese now has an 80 to 85 percent lexical similarity.\n\nThere are approximately five to seven thousand speakers of Mortlockese in the Mortlock Islands, Guam, Hawaii, and the United States. There are at least eleven different dialects that show some sort of correspondence to the Mortlock Island groups. \n\nMortlockese is an Austronesian language currently holding a 6b language status, meaning that it is threatened with extinction. More specifically, a language is given the 6b language status when it is only used for in-person communication (i.e., not written language), with a decline in the number of speakers. In the nuclear Micronesian languages, Mortlockese Language falls under the Chuukic category. One factor contributing to the present endangerment of Mortlockese are natural disasters, such as the typhoon that struck the Mortlock Islands in 1907. Such natural disasters kill many speakers of Mortlockese, and since the language is primarily transmitted orally, this removes many outlets for passing on the culture and language to youth.\n\nThe Mortlock islands, where Mortlockese is mainly spoken, is estimated to have had its first settlement around eight hundred to nine hundred years ago. There is evidence showing that the Mortlockese Language originated from the Chuuk Lagoon since many Mortlock natives trace their history back to the Chuuk Lagoon islands. Along with the genealogies, many clans that exist in the Mortlock islands also exist in the Chuuk Lagoon islands. In 1907, there was a typhoon that hit the Mortlock island Ta which caused the people there to move to Saipan and Pohnpei. Now, Mortlockese Language speakers can be found not only on the Mortlock islands, but also on Saipan and Pohnpei.\n\nDocumenting the language by writing it down was uncommon; instead, stories were passed down orally, which leads to less available documented history. Children learned from their parents and the stories told by relatives. The main role of girls growing up was to help their mothers and learn household tasks. For the boys, more “masculine” tasks such as fishing were promoted. Family life was important, and obedience was widely accepted by children in fear of a supernatural power punishing them. Myths and folktales told stories of religious and cultural beliefs passed down. Family is important to the Mortlock natives. Family structure is important and different rules are followed depending on the different islands. In several cases, the woman is head of the family. Sleeping arrangements may mean men in large homes separate from the women and children. Friendships are also extremely important within the Mortlockese culture. Friendship was more of a “brotherhood.” It is noted that if a friendship was formed between two people, each of the other’s family members became family as well.\n\nAs early as January 1874, missionaries visited the islands and began building schools to teach the natives religious ways of life. Their main efforts were to increase awareness of Puritanism. European clothes were introduced, as well as the prohibition of drugs and alcohol. There was concern of children in school falling out of touch with their native ways. The history and traditions of the Natives was approved and a new course was updated and continued for years. According to several documents, several changes to the curriculum were made to incorporate native traditions as well as to introduce new information from the Europeans.\n\nThe most common historical belief is that the Mortlock people arrived on the islands in canoes. Over the span of the 19th century, traders continued to document their visits to the islands allowing evidence of residency.\n\nIn 1907 a typhoon hit the Mortlock islands, destroying homes, and killing hundreds. Unfortunately, natural disasters, war, and other changes to the islands are to blame for the little to no documentation of the Mortlock history and language. What is left is the writings of missionaries who visited the island to teach the word of God, and to translate the Mortlockese Language into biblical text. There are documents of what curriculum was taught in the schools opened, as well as the number of students and teachers present. There are also certain rules that are noted in several cases implying that words are not always what they seem. In terms of family and kinship, personal names were used when referring to family instead of terms like “cousin,” or “grandparent.” Kinship terms categorize relatives instead of label them directly. This is just one example of grammar we can study from the way the Mortlockese language is designed.\n\nThe Mortlockese language is spoken in the Chuuk state. It is spoken in eleven distinct dialects over the eleven Mortlock Islands (Ettal, Kutt, Lekinioch, Losap, Moch, Nama, Namoluk, Oneop, Piis-Emwar, Satowan, Ta), all of which have mutual intelligibility. Speakers of Mortlockese are able to discern where other speakers are from, whether a different island or a different village, based on nuanced variations in speech patterns. There are approximately five to seven thousand speakers of the language, located mostly on the Mortlock Islands and throughout Micronesia, but also on the Pacific Islands (Hawaii and Guam in particular) and in the United States of America. In March 1907, in the wake of destruction caused by a typhoon that struck the Mortlock island Ta killing half the population there, the Mortlock people living on that island relocated to Saipan and Pohnpei. On Pohnpei, the Mortlocks spoke one of three Mortlockese dialects along with Pohnpeian or English as a second language in the multilingual community they formed. After a number of years, Mortlockese people living in Pohnpei returned to Pakin Atoll in the Mortlock Islands, where they spoke the kapsen Mwoshulok dialect, exhibiting adaptation and evolution, while retaining Pohnpeian as a second language. English is the national language in the Mortlock islands; however, most only use it when interacting with people from other places or in school. Rather than English, Mortlockese and Pohnpeian are the common spoken languages.\nThe Lukunosh dialect is one of the Southernmost Mortlockese dialects. \n\nLukunosh, a dialect of Mortlockese, has nine vowel phonemes and 15 consonant phonemes.\n\nTable retrieved from pg.100 of Odango, Emmerson.\n\nTable retrieved from pg.96 of Odango, Emmerson.\n\nGemination is possible for all consonants. (pg.98)\n\nSyllables are in the form of (C)(C)V(V)(C)(C), where (C) is an optional consonant and (V) is an optional vowel. An example of a CCVVCC syllable is \"so.ko.ppaat\" (meaning assorted in Lukunosh Mortlockese). (pg.110)\nReduplication occurs in some verbs to express extreme measure. It may also indicate an imperfective or habitual aspect.\n\nThe counting system in Mortlockese is a base 10 system. The following table includes the numbers used in serial counting, which can also be modified by numeral classifiers.\n\nTable retrieved from p.50 of A preliminary survey of the economic and social life of the Mortlock Islands people \n\nSerial counting requires use of the prefix “e-” and use of any number with a classifier changes the word of “one” from “-e” to “-te.” Numeral classifiers are used to relate an object’s characteristics, and examples include “-man” for the counting of animate subjects, “-faú” for round-shaped objects, and “-shé” for objects that are long. Possessive classifiers are used to indicate the relationship between a number of objects and the possessor of the objects. \n\nThere are eleven different dialects in the Mortlockese Language and according to researchers, speakers of Mortlockese can tell the difference between the different Mortlockese dialects. Most of these differences are in how words sound and how the spellings of words differ. \n\nTable retrieved from pg.24 of Odango, Emmerson.\n\nThe different dialects of Mortlockese have varying degrees of place deixis. For example, Lukunosh Mortlockese as spoken in Pukin has four levels of diexis (near speaker, near listener, far from speaker and listener, in the minds of speaker and listener) while Kúttú Mortlockese has five levels.\n\nIn addition to common nouns and proper nouns are relational nouns, which are further divided into three categories: oblique, locational, and partitive.\n\nSubject markers help to interpret either anaphoric arguments or grammatical agreements. \nObject markers show the third person singular object suffix where there is an overt object. \nBoth the third person singular object suffix and the other non third person singular object suffixes act as an anaphoric agreement when there is no overt object. \nA noun phrase is at minimum a bare noun. This bare noun can then be modified by demonstratives, possessive, and numeral classifiers. It is also possible to attach the stative TAM marker /mii/ after a bare noun and then add an adjective. An example is /uuʃ/ 'banana' turning into /uuʃ mii par/ 'red banana'. The structure of noun phrases generally follow the form: (Numeral) (possessive) (noun) (possessive suffix) (demonstrative suffix) (stative) (adjective). (pg.129)\n\nVerb phrases follow the form (Proclitic prefix) (subject) (TAM marker) (optional adverb) (verb) (suffix) (directional suffix) (object or noun), giving Mortlockese an SVO sentence structure. Subject pronouns used in the sentence are followed by an aspect morpheme, with only one aspect morpheme per clause. The only preposition used in the Mortlockese language is /mɞ/. \n\nMortlockese exhibits usage of inclusive pronouns such as the second-person plural word \"aumi\" which addresses a larger group than the individual with whom one is speaking to; the second-person singular \"aumi\" which involves just the speaker; the first-person plural exclusive \"aimi\", all of which can be translated to mean \"you\" but indicate different conditions of use.\n\nCommon or base nouns have no prefixes or suffixes and can be used with classifiers for counting. They can also be further categorized by possessive classifiers which indicate the relationship between the possessor and object as being indirect or alienable, and possessive suffixes are used to indicate direct or inalienable possession. Some nouns also indicate the specific use for the object in question, including the nature of how it is to be used by the subject in a sentence. Nouns can be modified by adjectives, demonstratives, and numeral classifiers and modified nouns will usually undergo vowel lengthening from (C)(V)(C) to (C)(V)(V)(C).\nTypes of nouns in Mortlockese include proper nouns, relational nouns (which cannot be modified and are used to indicate inalienable possession), oblique nouns, locational nouns, and partitive nouns. \n\nIntransitive verbs in Mortlockese are described by two separate classes. The first class is “unaccusatives”, which are linked to adjectives and can show that the object is undergoing a process or action. The other class is “unergatives,” which are more like actual verbs in that they describe actions rather than a state of being. Both types of intransitive verbs have related transitive verb forms. \n\nTransitive verbs require the use of direct object suffixes which reference the object of the phrase. These include prepositional verbs, which are used with a direct object suffix and are not used with causitives or reduplication to indicate different aspects. Transitive verbs in Mortlockese can be used alone or as followed by a direct object noun phrase in a clause. \n\nAdverbs can come before or after the verb in a sentence. Combining an adjective with the morpheme /lɛ/ and a verb will result in a form that roughly translates to the form of an English adverb ending with “-ly”. \n\nFour types of pronouns are used in Mortlockese. The first type, independent pronouns, can be used either as the subject or direct object of a phrase or sentence. Different variations or forms may be used or preferred in the different dialects, but all of the forms are interchangeable. \nSubject proclitics are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the subject. An example of linguistic metathesis is shown in the variation of the third-person plural sunject proclitic pronoun /ɛr=/ to /rɛ=/ where the use of either is accepted, but an individual speaker will only choose to use one form.\nDirect object suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the direct object of a phrase or sentence.\nLastly, possessive suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of possessors and the relationship between the speaker and the possessor.\nA verb can be combined with causative prefixes, transitive third-person direct object suffixes and thematic vowels (the inclusion of which depends on whether the ending of the verb is a vowel or a consonant) to create descriptive clauses that include pronouns. The different dialects will have different ways of modifying verbs and pronouns; likewise, generational differences yield different forms of word modifications. \nIndependent pronouns are used in response to WH questions. \nSingular and plural demonstratives are used to indicate proximity to the speaker or listener, and what number of objects there are. These words have the English equivalents of “this,” “that,” “here,” “there,” and the like. These can also be modified to indicate other qualities of the subject, such as in recalling something from the past that is not present with the speakers at the time they choose to discuss it. \n\nThe two types of conjunctions in Mortlockese are subordinators and coordinators. \nThe possessive classifier acts as the base of the word, and indicates the relationship of the possessum noun to the possessor. The general possessive classifier in Lukunosh is [jaa-].\n\nWhen attaching possessive suffixes to consonant-final words, a vowel is placed between the final consonant and the suffix. An example is [maas] (eye, face) becoming [masan] (their eye, face). The form [masn] is phonetically possible in Mortlockese, but is deemed impossible by speakers.\n\nCertain words cannot be spoken in the presence of the opposite sex. This gender-restrictive vocabulary, sometimes called cookhouse speech, may only be used when speaking to people of the same gender. This gender-restrictive vocabulary shows an example of avoidance speech, a type of honorific, in the Mortlockese Language. Mortlockese is a matrilineal society, considering the patrilineal lineage as secondary. The Mortlockese vocabulary includes terms to denote siblings and cousins of the same gender, and different terms to refer siblings and cousins of the opposite gender. Verbs can be transitive, intransitive(unergative or unaccusitive), or semitransitive.\n\n"}

These processes include, but are not limited to, advertising, promotion, distribution, and product management.\n\nMarketers may sell goods or services directly to consumers, known as business to customer (B2C marketing); commercial organisations (known as business to business marketing or B2B), to government; to not-for-profit organisations (Not-for-profit orgnanization (NFP)) or some combination of any of these.\n\nMarketers typically begin planning with a detailed understanding of customer needs and wants. \n\nExchange, the act of giving or taking one thing of value in return for another is central to marketing activities. Not all exchange involves Financial transactions, but may also involve barter, contra dealing or other form of trade. The object of exchange can include: Goods; services or experiences; concepts or ideas; causes and may even involve celebrity marketing\n\nGiven that marketing has its roots in economics, it shares many foundation concepts with that discipline. Most practicing marketers will have a working knowledge of basic economic concepts and theories.\n\nBusinesses seek to compete by achieving competitive advantages or comparative advantages. Competitive advantages often focus on reducing costs through achieving one or more of the following: Economies of scope; Economies of scale; Experience effects; First-mover advantages. Alternatively a business may seek to develop develop uniqueness through product differentiation or developing unique competencies such as market sensing, rapid market response or delivering superior customer value.\nsuperior value.\n\nDifferent types of competitive markets can be identified: Duopoly; Monopoly; Monopolistic competition; Imperfect competition; Oligopoly\n\nUnderstanding demand and supply is essential for determining market size and market potential as well as in the price-setting function.\n\nIn Western economies, the capitalist economy dominates. However, other types of economic systems such as barter economies and the Sharing economy can be identified.\n\n\nValue-in-ownership\nValue-in-use\n\n\n\nMarketing planning is just one facet of the overall company's planning. Marketing plans must therefore take their guidance from the overall strategic plan or business plan. Most companies produce both a strategic plan and a managerial plan (also known as an operational plan). The distinction between strategic planning and management planning is that they are two phases with different goals.\n\nStrategic planning requires sophisticated research and analysis to document the firm's current situation as well as to identify opportunities with the potential to be developed.\n\nStrategic research is primarily concerned with the identification of new business opportunities and threats, which derive from the external operating environment. Accordingly, strategic analysts rely less on traditional market research methods. Instead, they use methods such as: Environmental scanning; Marketing intelligence (also known as competitive intelligence) and Futures research\n\nMarketers draw on a very wide variety of techniques and tools when analysing the market and the broader operating conditions. The technique selected depends on the nature of the situation or problem to be investigated and the analyst's skill and experience. Strategic analysts employ some 200 different quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques including:\n\nBrand Development Index (BDI); Category development index (CDI); Brand/ Category penetration; Benchmarking; Blindspots analysis; Functional capability and resource analysis; Impact analysis; Counterfactual analysis; Demand analysis; Emerging Issues Analysis; Experience curve analysis; Gap analysis; Herfindahl index; impact analysis; se Analysis (also known as Porter's five forces analysis); Management profiling; Market segmentation analysis; Market share analysis; Market Segmentation analysis; Perceptual mapping; PEST analysis or its variants including PESTLE, STEEPLED and STEER; Portfolio analysis, such as BCG growth-share matrix or GE business screen matrix; Positioning analysis; Precursor Analysis or Evolutionary analysis; Product life cycle analysis and S-curve analysis (also known as technology life cycle or hype cycle analysis); Product evolutionary cycle analysis; Scenario analysis; Segment Share Analysis; Situation analysis; Strategic Group Analysis; SWOT analysis; Trend Analysis; Value chain analysis\n\n\n\n\nImplementation and control and control is an important feature of the planning process. From time to time, marketers will use appropriate measures of performance to gauge whether plans are achieving the desired results. If necessary, corrective action can be taken to get back on track.\n\nThe book titled, \"The Marketing Book,\" 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016 edited by Michael J. Baker and Susan Hart identifies the distinct branches of marketing practice as:\n\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the relevant topics for each of these key branches of marketing, see on this page. For special applications of marketing including marketing of specific types of products (e.g. agricultural marketing, faith based marketing, pharmaceutical marketing, political marketing, sports marketing, etc.,) or marketing to specific target groups (e.g. marketing to children, marketing to older people, LBGT marketing) see: Special applications of marketing practice).\n\nMarketing orientations are the philosophies or mindsets that guide and shape marketing planning and marketing practice. Some marketing historians believe that different philosophies have informed marketing practice at different times in marketing's history. Although there is no real agreement amongst scholars about the precise nature or number of distinct marketing orientations, the most commonly cited include:\n\n\nMarketing planning or the process of developing a marketing program requires a detailed understanding of the marketing framework including Consumer behavior; Market segmentation and Marketing research. In the process of understanding the consumer market to be served, marketers may need to consider such issues as:\n\n\nThe main steps in the consumer's purchase decision process are:\nNeed or problem recognition → Information search → Evaluation of alternatives → Product/Brand Choice → Post purchase behaviour\n\n\nConsumers purchase decisions are influenced by a range of internal and external factors including:\n\nMarketing research refers to research activities designed to understand the marketing environment, including competitors, the socio-cultural environment and the politico-legal operating environment. Market research specifically refers to research concerned with understanding the market, that is consumers and is designed to yield actionable customer insights.\n\nQuantitative methods may also be known as Scientific methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nList of abbreviations for market segments\n\n\n\nThe main bases for segmenting consumer markets include:\n\n\nThe main bases for segmenting business or industrial markets include:\n\n\n\n\nTo support, market segmentation analysis marketers may require access to databases with large sample sizes. A number of commercial companies provide such data which typically includes proprietary software designed to interrogate the data and backed by algorithms that support different types of segmentation approaches. These commercial databases are often country or region specific.\nPopular geo-demographic segmentation databases include:\n\nPopular psychometric tools include:\n\n\nThe marketing program, also known as the marketing mix or the 4 ps consists of the product, price, place and promotion.\n\n\nInnovation and New product development are an important part of a firm's long term growth strategy.\n\nThe steps in a basic new production development process are:\n\nThe NPD process can be applied to:\n\nA recent trend in NPD is the use of participatory design, also known as co-design or co-operative design, which involves stakeholders such as employees or consumers in the design process.\n\nSources of new product ideas include: Research and development; Consumers or Users; distributors, suppliers or crowdsourcing.\n\nTypes of innovation\n\nNPD represents a high risk activity. It requires substantial investment and a list of product failures suggests that the probability of failure is relatively high.\n\nNew product adoption and diffusion\n\nIn order to develop a superior understanding of how new products are adopted by the market place and the factors that influence adoption rates, marketers often turn to a number of models or theories of the adoption/diffusion process:\n\n\nNew product development, including the design of product features, manufacturing processes, packaging design etc. involves creative work and therefore constitutes intellectual property. A number of different legal avenues are available to protect different types of intellectual property.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following methods are prohibited in most nations: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe extended marketing mix is used in the marketing of services, ideas and customer experiences and typically refers to a model of 7 Ps and includes the original 4 Ps plus process, physical evidence and people. Some texts use a model of 8 Ps and include performance level (service quality) as an 8th P.\n\n\n\n\nMarketing activities are costly and represent an investment in a company or brand's long term future. With the increased emphasis on accountability, marketers must consider how they measure marketing's performance and communicate that to stakeholders.

The dynasty was founded by Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1925, a former brigadier-general of the Persian Cossack Brigade, whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdicate by the Allies after the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. He was succeeded by his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran.\n\nThe Pahlavis came to power after Ahmad Shah Qajar, the last ruler of the Qajar dynasty, proved unable to stop British and Soviet encroachment on Iranian sovereignty, had his position extremely weakened by a military coup, and was removed from power by the parliament while in France. The National Senate, known as the \"Majlis\", convening as a Constituent Assembly on 12 December 1925, deposed the young Ahmad Shah Qajar, and declared Reza Khan the new King (\"Shah\") of the Imperial State of Persia. In 1935, Reza Shah asked foreign delegates to use the endonym Iran in formal correspondence and the official name the Imperial State of Iran ( \"Keshvar-e Shâhanshâhi-ye Irân\") was adopted.\n\nFollowing the \"coup d'état\" in 1953 supported by United Kingdom and the United States, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became more autocratic and was aligned with the Western Bloc during the Cold War. Faced with growing public discontent and popular rebellion throughout 1978 and after declaring surrender and officially resigning, the second Pahlavi went into exile with his family in January 1979, sparking a series of events that quickly led to the end of the state and the beginning of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 11 February 1979, officially ending the 2,500-year-old Persian monarchy.\n\nThe Pahlavi dynasty was an Iranian royal dynasty of Mazandarani ethnicity .The Pahlavi dynasty originated in Mazandaran province. In 1878 Reza Shah Pahlavi was born into Major family of Abbas Ali Khan and Noushafarin Ayromlou at the village of Alasht located in Savadkuh County, Māzandarān Province. His mother was a Muslim immigrant from Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), whose family had emigrated to mainland Persia after Persia was forced to cede all of its territories in the Caucasus following the Russo-Persian Wars several decades prior to Reza Shah's birth. His father was commissioned in the 7th Savadkuh Regiment, and served in the Anglo-Persian War in 1856.\n\nIn 1925, Reza Khan, a former Brigadier-General of the Persian Cossack Brigade, deposed the Qajar dynasty and declared himself king (shah), adopting the dynastic name of \"Pahlavi\", which recalls the Middle Persian language of the Sasanian Empire. By the mid-1930s, Rezā Shāh's strong secular rule caused dissatisfaction among some groups, particularly the clergy, who opposed his reforms, but the middle and upper-middle class of Iran liked what Rezā Shāh did. In 1935, Rezā Shāh issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term Iran in formal correspondence, in accordance with the fact that \"Persia\" was a term used by Western peoples for the country called \"Iran\" in Persian. His successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, announced in 1959 that both Persia and Iran were acceptable and could be used interchangeably.\n\nReza Shah tried to avoid involvement with the UK and the Soviet Union. Though many of his development projects required foreign technical expertise, he avoided awarding contracts to British and Soviet companies because of dissatisfaction during the Qajar Dynasty between Persia, the UK, and the Soviets. Although the UK, through its ownership of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, controlled all of Iran's oil resources, Rezā Shāh preferred to obtain technical assistance from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries. This created problems for Iran after 1939, when Germany and Britain became enemies in World War II. Reza Shah proclaimed Iran as a neutral country, but Britain insisted that German engineers and technicians in Iran were spies with missions to sabotage British oil facilities in southwestern Iran. Britain demanded that Iran expel all German citizens, but Rezā Shāh refused, claiming this would adversely affect his development projects.\n\nOn 13 September 1943 the Allies reassured the Iranians that all foreign troops would leave by 2 March 1946. At the time, the Tudeh Party of Iran, a communist party that was already influential and had parliamentary representation, was becoming increasingly militant, especially in the North. This promoted actions from the side of the government, including attempts of the Iranian armed forces to restore order in the Northern provinces. While the Tudeh headquarters in Tehran were occupied and the Isfahan branch crushed, the Soviet troops present in the Northern parts of the country prevented the Iranian forces from entering. Thus, by November 1945 Azerbaijan had become an autonomous state helped by the Tudeh party. This puppet government of the Soviet Union only lasted until November 1946.\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi replaced his father on the throne on 16 September 1941. He wanted to continue the reform policies of his father, but a contest for control of the government soon erupted between him and an older professional politician, the nationalistic Mohammad Mosaddegh.\n\nIn 1951, the \"Majlis\" (the Parliament of Iran) named Mohammad Mossadegh as new prime minister by a vote of 79–12, who shortly after nationalized the British-owned oil industry (see Abadan Crisis). Mossadegh was opposed by the Shah who feared a resulting oil embargo imposed by the West would leave Iran in economic ruin. The Shah fled Iran but returned when the United Kingdom and the United States staged a coup against Mossadegh in August 1953 (see Operation Ajax). Mossadegh was then arrested by pro-Shah army forces.\n\nMajor plans to build Iran's infrastructure were undertaken, a new middle class began flourishing and in less than two decades Iran became the indisputable major economic and military power of the Middle East.\n\nThe Shah's government suppressed its opponents with the help of Iran's security and intelligence secret police, SAVAK. Such opponents included leftists and Islamists.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, relying on increased oil revenues, Mohammad Reza began a series of even more ambitious and bolder plans for the progress of his country and the march toward the \"White Revolution\". But his socioeconomic advances increasingly irritated the clergy. Islamic leaders, particularly the exiled cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, were able to focus this discontent with an ideology tied to Islamic principles that called for the overthrow of the Shah and the return to Islamic traditions, called the Islamic revolution. The Pahlavi regime collapsed following widespread uprisings in 1978 and 1979. The Islamic Revolution dissolved the SAVAK and replaced it with the SAVAMA. It was run after the revolution, according to U.S. sources and Iranian exile sources in the US and in Paris, by Gen. Hossein Fardoust, who was deputy chief of SAVAK under Mohammad Reza's reign, and a friend from boyhood of the deposed monarch.\n\nMohammad Reza fled the country, seeking medical treatment in Egypt, Mexico, the United States, and Panama, and finally resettled with his family in Egypt as a guest of Anwar Sadat. On his death, his son Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi succeeded him \"in absentia\" as heir apparent to the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Pahlavi and his wife live in the United States in Potomac, Maryland, with three daughters.\n\nUnder the Qajar dynasty the Persian character of Iran was not very explicit. Although the country was referred to as Persia by westerners, and the dominant language in court and administration was Persian the dichotomy between pure Persian and Turkic elements had remained obvious until 1925. The Pahlavi rule was instrumental in Iran's nationalisation in line with Persian culture and language which, amongst other ways, was achieved through the official ban on the use minority languages such as Azerbaijani and successful suppression of separatist movements. Reza Pahlavi is credited for reunification of Iran under a powerful central government. The use of minority languages in schools and newspapers was not tolerated. The succeeding regime – the Islamic Republic of Iran – has adopted a more inclusive approach in relation to the use of ethnic minorities and their language, however the issues as to Azeris, the Iran's largest ethnic minority, remain and pose considerable challenges for the unity and territorial integrity of Iran.\n\nAs Ganji writes, the group submitted at least 30 solid reports within 13 years on a corruption of high-ranking officials and the royal circle, but Shah called the reports \"false rumors and fabrications\". Parviz Sabeti, a high-ranking official of SAVAK believed that the one important reason for success of regime's opposition is corruption.\n\n\n"}

Usually parklets are installed on parking lanes and use several parking spaces. Parklets typically extend out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space.\n\nParklets are intended for people. Parklets offer a place to stop, to sit, and to rest while taking in the activities of the street. In instances where a parklet is not intended to accommodate people, it may provide greenery, art, or some other visual amenity. A parklet may accommodate bicycle parking within it, or bicycle parking may be associated with it.\n\nA parklet may be thought of as permanent, but must be designed for quick and easy removal for emergencies or other reasons such as snow removal without damage to the curb or street. As initially conceived, a parklet is always open to the public. However, some cities have allowed restaurants to create parklets that are not open to the public such as Long Beach, California, Fargo, North Dakota and Montreal, Quebec.\n\nSan Francisco has been credited with introducing the first parklet. Since then, parklets have been introduced in cities such as Ames, Iowa and Puebla de Zaragoza, Mexico.\n\nThe world’s first formal public parklets were initially conceived by Italian/Brazilian designer and London resident Suzi Bolognese (Sb Design Studio) and installed in San Francisco in 2010.\nIn August 2012, the School of Architecture at University of Southern California published a graduate thesis \"Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government,\" which provided a comprehensive history of the creation of parklet and plaza programs in four California cities. In September 2012, the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs published a report, \"Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets\", examining case studies for parklets in seven cities across North America. In February 2013, The San Francisco Planning Department published a Parklet Manual which serves as a comprehensive overview of the goals, policies, process, procedures and guidelines for creating a parklet in San Francisco. The Manual also serves as a resource for those outside of San Francisco working to establish parklet programs in their own cities.\n\nParklets are designed to provide a public place for passersby to relax and enjoy the atmosphere of the city around them, in places where either current urban parks are lacking or where the existing sidewalk width is not large enough to accommodate vibrant street life activities. Parklets can be designed to be either permanent fixtures, or can be designed to be temporary/seasonal in places where snow removal is a concern. Seasonal parklets are found in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Many cities choose to install these sites in order to create more public space by creating \"places for people to sit, relax and enjoy the city.\" The Vancouver 2013 Parklet Pilot Program Guide explains parklets purpose and design as \"benefit local businesses, residents, and visitors by providing unique public spaces that attract customers and foster community conversation. They can also have additional benefits such as adding more space for people to walk in congested areas. The typical design is a platform that extends the sidewalk and provides amenities like seats, tables, bike racks, and landscaping\"\n\nIn September 2010, The San Francisco Great Streets Project (then part of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition) published a study, \"Divisadero Trial Parklet Impact Report,\" on one of the first eight parklets built in San Francisco. This study was followed in January 2012 by a \"Parklet Impact Study\" analyzing three corridors in San Francisco. From October 2012 to March 2013, Los Angeles research collaborative Parklet Studies worked under the Complete Streets Working Group of Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council to design and implement a one-year study of the Parklets in downtown Los Angeles. The final report was released in March 2013.\n\nIn the United States, San Francisco hosts more parklets than any other City. The first one-day parklet installation was created in 2005 as an unofficial activist project by feeding a parking meter with coins, unrolling grass sod, and placing a potted tree on top. The city's \"Pavement to Parks\" program was formed to facilitate installation of parklets as longer-term, yet still temporary, fixtures. As of 2011 the program had received over 50 applications from sponsors around the city. In 2011 the Union Square Business Improvement District installed the most ambitious parklet, a 2-block long installation along Powell Street near Union Square, funded by a corporate donation by Audi.\n\nParklets have sprung up in Phoenix, Philadelphia, Oakland, Los Angeles, San Jose, Dallas, Seattle, San Diego, Vancouver, British Columbia and Morro Bay, CA.\n\nParklets are typically spaces for passive recreation, The first parklets with active recreation were installed in Los Angeles, CA in February 2013. Two sites on Spring Street, in Downtown Los Angeles, each feature two exercise bicycles on site. Upon evaluation, 20% of people surveyed in the sites said they previously used the machines; but only 5% of activity observed recorded use of the machines. Active recreation use of parklets may need some additional motivation to increase use at the exercise machines.\n\nParklets have also been created in Mexico in Puebla de Zaragoza during the PueblaDesignFest\n\nThe first Parklet on the street in London has been installed in July 2015.\n\nIn April 2018, a Parklet was also created on The Calls in Leeds, UK, as a result of a partnership between Leeds Business Improvement District (LeedsBID), Leeds City Council, and LAAND landscape architects.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36065288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36065288", "title": "Pollution-induced community tolerance", "text": "Pollution-induced community tolerance\n\nPollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) is an approach to measuring the response of pollution–induced selective pressures on a community. It is an eco-toxicological tool that approaches community tolerance to pollution from a holistic standpoint. Community Tolerance can increase in one of three ways: physical adaptations or phenotypic plasticity, selection of favorable genotypes, and the replacement of sensitive species by tolerant species in a community.\n\nPICT differs from the population tolerance approach to community tolerance in that it can be easily applied to any ecosystem and it is not critical to use a representative test organism, as with the population tolerance approach.\n\nCommunity tolerance can be used as indicator for determining if a toxicant has a disturbance on an exposed community for multiple types of organisms. Tolerance of a toxicant can increase by three ways: physiological adaptation, also known as the phenotypic plasticity of an individual; tolerant genotypes selected within a population over time; and the replacement of species with more tolerant ones within a community. Physiological adaptation, or phenotypic plasticity, is the ability of an individual organism to change its phenotype in response to changes in the environment. This can occur with huge variance between the type of organism and the type of the disturbance they experience. Natural selection that occurs over several generations causes an entire population to exhibit specific selection of genotypes. Over time, tolerant genotypes can be selected over non-tolerant ones and can cause a shift in a population’s genome. Natural selection can also cause a replacement of less tolerant species with more tolerant species. All of these aspects can alter a community's structure drastically, and if a toxicant can be identified as the culprit, action can take place to prevent that toxicant from further accumulating. PICT can be used for linkage between cause and effect of the toxicants due to the structure of a community that has survived the event, also known as toxicant-induced succession (TIS). Toxicant-induced succession would be the development of more tolerant generations once a chemical was introduced into the environment.\n\nThere are two types of tolerances that can occur: multiple and co-tolerance. Multiple tolerances can elevate an individual' ability to tolerate several toxicants present at once. This means that the type of chemicals present in the environment, the concentration, and the organisms that are affected could alter the environment in multiple different ways. Co-tolerance is the ability of an organism to develop a tolerance to a certain toxicant in short-term tests, and obtain that tolerance for other toxicants similar to the first. It can be difficult to determine which type of tolerance is occurring if there are multiple types of toxicants in a community because they could be acting simultaneously. Basically it is difficult to understand what exactly may be going on in a community without testing it with multiple ecotoxicological tools with long- and short-term toxicity tests.\n\nAssessing pollution-induced community tolerance can be done utilizing in situ techniques, many of which involve the use of known or created chemical exposure gradients. One example is the use of a known concentration gradient of Tri-n-butylin to assess PICT in periphyton. Tolerance patterns showed that tolerance was highest closest to the marina that was the source of contamination. The use of reference sites in addition to contaminated sites is also commonly used for translocation assessments of PICT. A study in Germany cultured periphyton on glass discs in two river systems north of Leipzig, Germany. One system was the contaminated area of study and the other was 10 km upstream and uncontaminated, intended to be used as a reference. After the colonization period, 6 of the 10 racks of glass discs were trans-located to the other river system. During the experiment the community structure present on the glass discs from the reference site, when translocated to the contaminated site changed to mirror that of the control discs that were left in the contaminated sites. In another study in Denmark, enclosure experiments were done allowing for an assessment of PICT utilizing the lake water from Lake Bure as a baseline. By using this water from the lake potentially confounding variables would be nullified by comparing results to the control. Concentrations of atrazine and copper were added to these enclosures in varying concentrations. As in other experiments previously discussed periphyton communities were used in this experiment and were cultured using glass discs. Photosynthetic activity was measured and used as a measurement of PICT throughout the experiment. The experiment showed that elevated levels of Cu lead to community tolerance of the phytoplankton community as well as co-tolerance of zinc. Total Biomass decreased at the outset of the trials involving high concentrations of Cu indicating that Community Tolerance was increased due to direct mortality of the sensitive species.\n\nThe use of PICT in an in situ fashion is not limited to aquatic systems. A study involving 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene utilized respirometric techniques to measure Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance in soil microbial communities in response to the presence of TNT. The results of this study further corroborate the PICT Theory, in that treatments with long-term exposure to TNT had a larger proportion of TNT-resistant bacteria than soils with low levels of TNT. This PICT caused by TNT was also present in another study.\n\nIdeally, pollution-induced community tolerance can be assessed in the field by using a representative sample of the natural community in response to environmental contamination. However, this is not always the case, which is why laboratory studies are necessary supplements to properly assess PICT.\n\nThe laboratory investigation of PICT is necessary to eliminate factors other than pollution that may affect community structure. It can be conducted in conjunction with field work, as in the study by Blanck and Dahl (1996). In this study, the results from laboratory acute toxicity tests of TBT on periphyton corroborated the results from the field study, supporting the conclusion that toxicity to periphyton resulted from TBT pollution at the site under investigation. The results from acute toxicity tests can thus help determine whether the effect identified is due to a specific contaminant.\n\nThere are a variety of methods for laboratory testing, but a general format includes sampling, a bioassay, and an analysis of community structure.\n\nSamples can be collected on artificial or natural substrata, either in situ or in the laboratory. There must be a series of samples exposed to different concentrations of contaminant and a control sample. In situ sampling involves setting up a sampling device in an aquatic ecosystem and allowing it to colonize for some time (e.g. a couple of weeks). One example is the diatometer, a device that is deployed in the water that becomes colonized by diatoms, and then is removed for analysis. In situ sampling devices are set up at increasing distances from the pollution source in the case of point source pollution. The samples thus represent a gradient in contaminant concentration, assuming that the contaminant becomes more dilute with increasing distance from the point source. An example of laboratory sampling was used in a study by Schmitt-Jansen and Altenburger (2005). For 14 days communities were allowed to establish on discs set up in laboratory aquariums which were continuously mixed and inoculated with algae from a pond. The aquariums were dosed with different concentrations of herbicide to get a gradient of long-term (14-day) contaminant exposures. Once a week the aquarium water was completely replaced and re-dosed with herbicide.\n\nA bioassay is conducted on the samples to test for correlation between tolerance and long-term contaminant exposure. First, samples are exposed to different concentrations of contaminant. Then an endpoint is measured to determine the toxic effect on the sample organisms. The results from these measurements are used to produce an EC50. Both Blanck (1996) and Schmitt-Jansen and Altenburger (2005) photosynthesis as their endpoint.\n\nCommunity structure of the samples is analyzed to check for a correlation between species prevalence and long-term contaminant exposure. Samples are taxonomically classified to determine the composition and species diversity of the communities that established over the long term exposures. The results are compared to the concentration of contaminant in the long-term exposure to conclude if a relationship was found in the study.\n"}

{"id": "49022941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49022941", "title": "Sheet dealing", "text": "Sheet dealing\n\nSheet dealing is a term used in publishing to describe the practice of extending a print-run by 'running on' extra copies of a book's sheets, which are then sold on to a subsidiary overseas publisher to be bound into books. Sheet dealing, which can allow publishers to reduce the amount of royalties they pay authors, has been widespread among multinationals since the 1980s.\n\nMethods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s, due to the rise of retail chain booksellers, which demanded increasing discounts from publishers. As a result, rather than paying royalties based on a percentage of a book’s cover price, publishers preferred to pay royalties based on their net receipts. In 1991, Frederick Nolan, author and former publishing executive, explained how the new system made 'sheet dealing' possible:\n\n'It makes sense for the publisher to pay the author on the basis of what he receives, but it by no means makes it a good deal for the author. Example: 10,000 copies of a $20 book with a 10 percent cover-price royalty will earn him $20,000. The same number sold but discounted at 55 percent will net the publisher $90,000; the author's ten percent of that figure yields him $9,000. Which is one reason why publishers prefer \"net receipts\" contracts...Among the many other advantages (to the publisher) of such contracts is the fact that they make possible what is called a 'sheet deal'. In this, the (multinational) publisher of that same 10,000 copy print run, can substantially reduce his printing cost by 'running on' a further 10,000 copies (that is to say, printing but not binding them), and then further profit by selling these 'sheets' at cost-price or even lower if he so chooses to subsidiaries or overseas branches, then paying the author 10 percent of 'net receipts' from that deal. The overseas subsidiaries bind up the sheets into book form and sell at full price for a nice profit to the Group as a whole. The only one who loses is the author.'\n\nIn 1991, David Croom, managing director of Routledge, declared that discounts could be as high as '80% in the case of bulk overseas sales.'\n\nIn 2003 two American authors Ken Englade and Patricia Simpson sued HarperCollins (USA) for selling their work to its foreign affiliates in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK at improperly high discounts (72.5% for hardback and trade paperbacks and 75% for mass market paperbacks). They asserted 'that Harper Collins has improperly engaged in selling quantities of its books on a non-returnable basis to its foreign affiliates, at below-market prices. Thus, according to plaintiffs, since Harper Collins and its foreign affiliates all have the same parent company, and since all of the contracts between authors and Harper Collins require that calculations of royalties to such authors be based on amounts \"received\" by Harper Collins, Harper Collins is essentially selling books to itself, at discounted rates, upon which it then calculates the author's royalty, and then Harper Collins shares in the extra profit when the book is resold to the consumer by the foreign affiliates, without paying the author any further royalty.')\n\nThe suit was successful, and the court forced a class action readjustment for all authors contracted by HarperCollins between November 1993 and June 1999. The publisher settled the action by making lump sum payments to all those authors who had received royalties paid on sales to foreign affiliates at these very high discounts \n\nIn 2003, following the HarperCollins case, Nicola Solomon, a leading British literary lawyer, was asked about the fairness of sheet dealing:\n\n'This is a very difficult issue. Most unagented authors (and some with agents) grant worldwide volume rights, sub-licence and subsidiary rights including translation rights to their publishers. Many publishers choose to sell or sub-license to their overseas associate companies. This can work in your favour; very often a publisher is able to give a larger advance because it knows that its associate will take the book overseas. In an ideal world its established relations with its associate company should allow the two companies to work smoothly together to ensure that sales are maximised. However, many authors are rightly suspicious that cosy deals go on within groups which result in lesser overall royalties to the author...Publishers must make reasonable endeavours to sell books, and must deal with third parties on a bona fide arm's length basis which is reasonable and fair to you. Publishers are not entitled to make a secret profit by selling through a subsidiary, particularly if you would have obtained more by direct sales.\n\nIf your work has been sold to an associate company it is worth asking your publisher some questions to ensure that you are obtaining a fair royalty. Even better, ask that you be paid royalties on all sales linked to British published price or on a percentage of the associated company's receipts. Some publishers already calculate US royalties according to the receipts of their American subsidiary, which is clearly much better for authors...If you are unhappy about what your publisher is doing, don't simply accept it; ask for an explanation about anything that seems odd, check in your contract to see if it is covered and then speak to the Society or a solicitor if you are still uneasy.'\n"}

It is called ' () or ' () in the language itself.\n\nSlovak is the official language of Slovakia, where it is spoken by approximately 5.51 million people (2014). Slovak speakers are also found in the United States, the Czech Republic, Argentina, Serbia, Ireland, Romania, Poland, Canada, Hungary, Croatia, Israel, the United Kingdom, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other countries worldwide.\n\nSlovak should not be confused with Slovene, or Slovenian (' or '), the main language of Slovenia.\n\nSlovak uses the Latin script with small modifications that include the four diacritics (ˇ, ´, ¨, ˆ) placed above certain letters (a-á,ä; c-č; d-ď; dz-dž; e-é; i-í; l-ľ,ĺ; n-ň; o-ó,ô; r-ŕ; s-š; t-ť; u-ú; y-ý; z-ž)\n\nThe primary principle of Slovak spelling is the phonemic principle. The secondary principle is the morphological principle: forms derived from the same stem are written in the same way even if they are pronounced differently. An example of this principle is the assimilation rule (see below). The tertiary principle is the etymological principle, which can be seen in the use of \"i\" after certain consonants and of \"y\" after other consonants, although both \"i\" and \"y\" are pronounced almost, but usually the same way.\n\nFinally, the rarely applied grammatical principle is present when, for example, the basic singular form and plural form of masculine adjectives are written differently with no difference in pronunciation (e.g. \"pekný\" = nice – singular versus \"pekní\" = nice – plural).\n\nIn addition, the following rules are present:\n\nMost foreign words receive Slovak spelling immediately or after some time. For example, \"weekend\" is spelled \"víkend\", \"software\" – \"softvér\", \"gay\" – \"gej\" (both not exclusively), and \"quality\" is spelled \"kvalita.\" Personal and geographical names from other languages using Latin alphabets keep their original spelling unless a fully Slovak form of the name exists (e.g. \"Londýn\" for \"London\").\n\nSlovak features some heterophonic homographs (words with identical spelling but different pronunciation and meaning), the most common examples being \"krásne\" (beautiful) versus \"krásne\" (beautifully).\n\n\n\n\nThe main features of Slovak syntax are as follows:\n\nSome examples include the following:\n\n\nWord order in Slovak is relatively free, since strong inflection enables the identification of grammatical roles (subject, object, predicate, etc.) regardless of word placement. This relatively free word order allows the use of word order to convey topic and emphasis.\n\nSome examples are as follows:\n\nThe unmarked order is subject–verb–object. Variation in word order is generally possible, but word order is not completely free.\nIn the above example, the noun phrase \"ten veľký muž\" cannot be split up, so that the following combinations are not possible:\n\nAnd the following is stylistically not correct:\n\nSlovak does not have articles. The demonstrative pronoun \"ten\" (fem: \"tá\", neuter: \"to\") may be used in front of the noun in situations where definiteness must be made explicit.\n\nSlovak nouns are inflected for case and number. There are six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and instrumental. The vocative is no longer morphologically marked. There are two numbers: singular and plural. Nouns have inherent gender. There are three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Adjectives and pronouns must agree with nouns in case, number, and gender.\n\nThe numerals 0–10 have unique forms, with numerals 1–4 requiring specific gendered representations. Numerals 11–19 are formed by adding \"násť\" to the end of each numeral. The suffix \"dsať\" is used to create numerals 20, 30 and 40; for numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, \"desiat\" is used. Compound numerals (21, 1054) are combinations of these words formed in the same order as their mathematical symbol is written (e.g. 21 = dvadsaťjeden, literally \"twenty-one\").\n\nThe numerals are as follows:\nSome higher numbers: (200) dvesto... (300) tristo... (900) deväťsto... (1,000) tisíc... (1,100) tisícsto... (2,000) dvetisíc... (100,000) stotisíc... (200,000) dvestotisíc... (1,000,000) milión... (1,000,000,000) miliarda...\n\nCounted nouns have two forms. The most common form is the plural genitive (e.g. \"päť domov\" = five houses or \"stodva žien\" = one hundred two women), while the plural form of the noun when counting the amounts of 2-4, etc., is usually the nominative form without counting (e.g. \"dva domy\" = two houses or \"dve ženy\" = two women) but gender rules do apply in many cases.\n\nVerbs have three major conjugations. Three persons and two numbers (singular and plural) are distinguished. Several conjugation paradigms exist as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdverbs are formed by replacing the adjectival ending with the ending -\"o\" or -\"e\" / -\"y\". Sometimes both -\"o\" and -\"e\" are possible. Examples include the following:\n\nThe comparative/superlative of adverbs is formed by replacing the adjectival ending with a comparative/superlative ending -\"(ej)ší\" or -\"(ej)šie\". Examples include the following:\n\nEach preposition is associated with one or more grammatical cases. The noun governed by a preposition must appear in the case required by the preposition in the given context (e.g. from friends = \"od priateľov\"). \"Priateľov\" is the genitive case of \"priatelia\". It must appear in this case because the preposition \"od\" (= from) always calls for its objects to be in the genitive.\n\"Po\" has a different meaning depending on the case of its governed noun.\n\nThe Slovak language is a descendant of Proto-Slavic, itself a descendant of Proto-Indo-European. It is closely related to the other West Slavic languages, primarily to Czech and Polish. Czech also influenced the language in its later development. To lesser degrees, moreover, Slovak has been influenced by German, Latin, Hungarian, and recently English.\n\nAlthough most dialects of Czech and Slovak are mutually intelligible (see Comparison of Slovak and Czech), eastern Slovak dialects are less intelligible to speakers of Czech and closer to Polish, and contact between speakers of Czech and speakers of the eastern dialects is limited.\n\nSince the dissolution of Czechoslovakia it has been permitted to use Czech in TV broadcasting and—like any other language of the world—during court proceedings (Administration Procedure Act 99/1963 Zb.). From 1999 to August 2009, the Minority Language Act 184/1999 Z.z., in its section (§) 6, contained the variously interpreted unclear provision saying that \"When applying this act, it holds that the use of the Czech language fulfills the requirement of fundamental intelligibility with the state language\"; the state language is Slovak and the Minority Language Act basically refers to municipalities with more than 20% ethnic minority population (no such Czech municipalities are found in Slovakia). Since 1 September 2009 (due to an amendment to the State Language Act 270/1995 Z.z.) a language \"fundamentally intelligible with the state language\" (i.e. the Czech language) may be used in contact with state offices and bodies by its native speakers, and documents written in it and issued by bodies in the Czech Republic are officially accepted. Regardless of its official status, Czech is used commonly both in Slovak mass media and in daily communication by Czech natives as an equal language.\n\nCzech and Slovak have a long history of interaction and mutual influence well before the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, a state which existed until 1993. Literary Slovak shares significant orthographic features with Czech, as well as technical and professional terminology dating from the Czechoslovak period, but phonetic, grammatical, and vocabulary differences do exist.\n\nSlavic language varieties tend to be closely related, and have had a large degree of mutual influence, due to the complicated ethnopolitical history of their historic ranges. This is reflected in the many features Slovak shares with neighboring language varieties. Standard Slovak shares high degrees of mutual intelligibility with many Slavic varieties. Despite this closeness to other Slavic varieties, significant variation exists among Slovak dialects. In particular, eastern varieties differ significantly from the standard language, which is based on central and western varieties.\n\nEastern Slovak dialects have the greatest degree of mutual intelligibility with Polish of all the Slovak dialects followed by Rusyn, but both lack technical terminology and upper register expressions. Polish and Sorbian also differ quite considerably from Czech and Slovak in upper registers, but non-technical and lower register speech is readily intelligible. Some mutual intelligibility occurs with spoken Rusyn, Ukrainian, and even Russian (in this order), although their orthographies are based on the Cyrillic script.\n\n\nSports:\n\nFood:\n\nClothing:\n\nExclamations:\n\nNouns:\n\nVerbs:\n\nGreetings:\n\n\"Servus\" is commonly used as a greeting or upon parting in Slovak-speaking regions and some German-speaking regions, particularly Austria. \"Papa\" is also commonly used upon parting in these regions. Both \"servus\" and \"papa\" are used in colloquial, informal conversation\".\"\n\nHungarians and Slovaks have had a language interaction ever since the settlement of Hungarians in the Carpathian area. Hungarians also adopted many words from various Slavic languages related to agriculture and administration, and a number of Hungarian loanwords are found in Slovak. Some examples are as follows:\n\nThere are many Slovak dialects, which are divided into the following four basic groups:\n\nThe fourth group of dialects is often not considered a separate group, but a subgroup of Central and Western Slovak dialects (see e.g. Štolc, 1968), but it is currently undergoing changes due to contact with surrounding languages (Serbo-Croatian, Romanian, and Hungarian) and long-time geographical separation from Slovakia (see the studies in \"Zborník Spolku vojvodinských slovakistov\", e.g. Dudok, 1993).\n\nFor an external map of the three groups in Slovakia see here.\n\nThe dialect groups differ mostly in phonology, vocabulary, and tonal inflection. Syntactic differences are minor. Central Slovak forms the basis of the present-day standard language. Not all dialects are fully mutually intelligible. It may be difficult for an inhabitant of the western Slovakia to understand a dialect from eastern Slovakia and the other way around.\n\nThe dialects are fragmented geographically, separated by numerous mountain ranges. The first three groups already existed in the 10th century. All of them are spoken by the Slovaks outside Slovakia (USA, Canada, Croatian Slavonia, and elsewhere), and central and western dialects form the basis of the lowland dialects (see above).\n\nThe western dialects contain features common with the Moravian dialects in the Czech Republic, the southern central dialects contain a few features common with South Slavic languages, and the eastern dialects a few features common with Polish and the East Slavonic languages (cf. Štolc, 1994). Lowland dialects share some words and areal features with the languages surrounding them (Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian).\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first Red Crescent society of its kind and one of the most important charity organizations in the Muslim world.\n\nThe society is a not-for-profit, volunteer-based social service institution providing unconditional aid and service, and is a corporate body governed by special legal provisions.\n\nThe organization was founded under the Ottoman Empire on 11 June 1868 and was named \"Hilâl-i Ahmer Cemiyeti\".\n\nIt later took on the names:\nIt was renamed Kızılay by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1935, after the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923.\n\nBeginning with the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), the Turkish Red Crescent Society has provided medical relief to soldiers in all battlefields in which Turkey was present, through mobile and fixed hospitals, patient transportation services, hospital vessels, trained nurses and volunteers. It has provided humanitarian care regardless of nationality to all civilians affected by war. It has been involved in disaster relief and aid in natural disasters in Turkey. It has participated in international relief and response activities.\n\nExamples of disaster relief activities include:\n\n\nThe Turkish Red Crescent has recently begun to partner with Qatar Charity (QC) on various humanitarian projects.\n\nIn December 2016, the Turkish Red Crescent together with QC made a $10 million deal with the Turkish government to provide services for Syrian refugees in Turkey over the next five years. Kerem Kinik, head of the organization added “We have common areas of interest such as Palestine, Iraq and Somalia...this collaboration is just a beginning”.\n\nIn June 2016, the organization and QC provided aid to victims of flooding and violence in Beledweyne, Somalia. Somalia has lost much of its rural areas to al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda that consistently carries out attacks throughout the country.\n\nFollowing the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, the Turkish Red Crescent backed the Turkish government, sending a letter to hundreds of international aid organizations and NGOs, including to organizations of the United Nations and Red Crescents in 191 total countries. Like the government, the Turkish Red Crescent blamed the Gülen movement (which the government of Turkey considers a terrorist organization) for the coup attempt.\n\nIn November 6th-11th 2017, the International Red Cross and the Turkish Red Crescent movement brought together 190 national red cross and red crescent societies. Some major issues they discussed were: migration where they addressed prioritizing safety and assistance, nuclear weapons where they were working towards their elimination, and health where they addressed mental health and psycho social needs. Other issues included the need to involve affected people in relief and recovery efforts; the use of explosive weapons in popular areas; and the looming threat of epidemics and pandemics. \n\n\n"}

In the film, Funt secretly records people's reactions to unexpected encounters with nudity or sexuality in unusual situations. This was the first of two \"Candid Camera\"–style theatrical films to be produced and directed by Funt, the other being \"Money Talks\" (1972).\n\nWhile the film does contain some titillating material and both male and female full frontal nudity, a large amount of the film involves Funt talking to people about sexuality and sexual topics. Whereas Funt's other productions had to fall within Federal Communications Commission guidelines prohibiting nudity and sexual content on the airwaves, this film was outside the FCC's jurisdiction and Funt was free to incorporate them into the film.\n\nIn the U.S., the film was originally rated X by the Motion Picture Association of America; an edited version was rated R in 1982. When submitted to the British Board of Film Classification in 1970, the film was originally rejected, then rated X; a 1988 video release was rated 18.\n\nThe film was released on VHS in the 1980s, with a DVD released on December 6, 2011.\n\n\n\n"}
