{"id": "341876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341876", "title": "Aymara language", "text": "Aymara language\n\nAymara (; also ) is an Aymaran language spoken by the Aymara people of the Andes. It is one of only a handful of Native American languages with over one million speakers. Aymara, along with Spanish, is one of the official languages of Bolivia and parts of Peru. It is also spoken, to a much lesser extent, by some communities in northern Chile, where it is a recognized minority language.\n\nSome linguists have claimed that Aymara is related to its more widely spoken neighbor, Quechua. That claim, however, is disputed. Although there are indeed similarities, like the nearly-identical phonologies, the majority position among linguists today is that the similarities are better explained as areal features rising from prolonged cohabitation, rather than natural genealogical changes that would stem from a common protolanguage.\n\nAymara is an agglutinating and, to a certain extent, a polysynthetic language. It has a subject–object–verb word order.\n\nThe ethnonym \"Aymara\" may be ultimately derived from the name of some group occupying the southern part of what is now the Quechua speaking area of Apurímac. Regardless, the use of the word \"Aymara\" as a label for this people was standard practice as early as 1567, as evident from Garci Diez de San Miguel's report of his inspection of the province of Chucuito (1567, 14; cited in Lafaye 1964). In this document, he uses the term \"aymaraes\" to refer to the people. The language was then called Colla. It is believed that Colla was the name of an Aymara nation at the time of conquest, and later was the southernmost region of the Inca empire Collasuyu. However, Cerrón Palomino disputes this claim and asserts that Colla were in fact Puquina speakers who were the rulers of Tiwanaku in the first and third centuries (2008:246). This hypothesis suggests that the linguistically-diverse area ruled by the Puquina came to adopt Aymara languages in their southern region.\n\nIn any case, the use of \"Aymara\" to refer to the language may have first occurred in the works of the lawyer, magistrate and tax collector in Potosí and Cusco, Juan Polo de Ondegardo. This man, who later assisted Viceroy Toledo in creating a system under which the indigenous population would be ruled for the next 200 years, wrote a report in 1559 entitled ‘On the lineage of the Yncas and how they extended their conquests’ in which he discusses land and taxation issues of the Aymara under the Inca empire.\n\nMore than a century passed before \"Aymara\" entered general usage to refer to the language spoken by the Aymara people (Briggs, 1976:14). In the meantime the Aymara language was referred to as \"the language of the Colla\". The best account of the history of Aymara is that of Cerrón-Palomino, who shows that the ethnonym Aymara, which came from the glottonym, is likely derived from the Quechuaized toponym \"ayma-ra-y\" ‘place of communal property’. The entire history of this term is thoroughly outlined in his book, \"Voces del Ande\" (2008:19–32) and \"Lingüística Aimara\".\n\nThe suggestion that \"Aymara\" comes from the Aymara words \"\"jaya\" (ancient) and \"mara\"\" (year, time) is almost certainly a mistaken folk etymology.\n\nIt is often assumed that the Aymara language descends from the language spoken in Tiwanaku on the grounds that it is the native language of that area today. That is very far from certain, however, and most specialists now incline to the idea that Aymara did not expand into the Tiwanaku area until rather recently, as it spread southwards from an original homeland that was more likely to have been in Central Peru. Aymara placenames are found all the way north into central Peru. Indeed, (Altiplano) Aymara is actually the one of two extant members of a wider language family, the other surviving representative being Jaqaru.\n\nThe family was established by the research of Lucy Briggs (a fluent speaker) and Dr. Martha Hardman de Bautista of the Program in Linguistics at the University of Florida. Jaqaru [\"jaqi aru\" = human language] and Kawki communities are in the district of Tupe, Yauyos Valley, in the Dept. of Lima, in central Peru. Terminology for this wider language family is not yet well established. Hardman has proposed the name 'Jaqi' ('human') while other widely respected Peruvian linguists have proposed alternative names for the same language family. Alfredo Torero uses the term 'Aru' ('speech'); Rodolfo Cerrón-Palomino, meanwhile, has proposed that the term 'Aymara' should be used for the whole family, distinguished into two branches, Southern (or Altiplano) Aymara and Central Aymara (Jaqaru and Kawki). Each of these three proposals has its followers in Andean linguistics. In English usage, some linguists use the term Aymaran languages for the family and reserve 'Aymara' for the Altiplano branch.\n\nThere is some degree of regional variation within Aymara, but all dialects are mutually intelligible.\n\nMost studies of the language focused on either the Aymara spoken on the southern Peruvian shore of Lake Titicaca or the Aymara spoken around La Paz. Lucy Therina Briggs classifies both regions as being part of the Northern Aymara dialect, which encompasses the department of La Paz in Bolivia and the department of Puno in Peru. The Southern Aymara dialect is spoken in the eastern half of the Iquique province in northern Chile and in most of the Bolivian department of Oruro. It is also found in northern Potosí and southwest Cochabamba but is slowly being replaced by Quechua in those regions.\n\nIntermediate Aymara shares dialectical features with both Northern and Southern Aymara and is found in the eastern half of the Tacna and Moquegua departments in southern Peru and in the northeastern tip of Chile.\n\nThere are roughly two million Bolivian speakers, half a million Peruvian speakers, and perhaps a few thousand speakers in Chile. At the time of the Spanish conquest in the sixteenth century, Aymara was the dominant language over a much larger area than today, including most of highland Peru south of Cusco. Over the centuries, Aymara has gradually lost speakers both to Spanish and to Quechua; many Peruvian and Bolivian communities that were once Aymara-speaking now speak Quechua.\n\nAymara has three phonemic vowels , which, in most varieties of the language, distinguish two degrees of length. Long vowels are indicated with a diaeresis in writing: \"ä\", \"ï\", \"ü\". The high vowels are lowered to mid height when near uvular consonants ( → , → ).\n\nVowel deletion is frequent in Aymara. Every instance of vowel deletion occurs for one of three reasons: (i) phonotactic, (ii) syntactic, and (iii) morphophonemic.\n\n\nAs for the consonants, Aymara has phonemic stops at the labial, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular points of articulation. Stops show no distinction of voice (e.g. there is no phonemic contrast between and ), but each stop has three forms: plain (tenuis), glottalized, and aspirated. Aymara also has a trilled , and an alveolar/palatal contrast for nasals and laterals, as well as two semivowels ( and ).\n\nStress is usually on the second-to-last syllable, but long vowels may shift it. Although the final vowel of a word is elided except at the end of a phrase, the stress remains unchanged.\n\nThe vast majority of roots are bisyllabic and, with few exceptions, suffixes are monosyllabic. Roots conform to the template (C)V(C)CV, with CVCV being predominant. The majority of suffixes are CV, though there are some exceptions: CVCV, CCV, CCVCV and even VCV are possible but rare.\n\nThe agglutinative nature of this suffixal language, coupled with morphophonological alternations caused by vowel deletion and phonologically conditioned constraints, gives rise to interesting surface structures that operate in the domain of the morpheme, syllable, and phonological word/phrase. The phonological/morphophonological processes observed include syllabic reduction, epenthesis, deletion, and reduplication.\n\nBeginning with Spanish missionary efforts, there have been many attempts to create a writing system for Aymara. The colonial sources employed a variety of writing systems heavily influenced by Spanish, the most widespread one being that of Bertonio. Many of the early grammars employed unique alphabets as well as the one of Middendorf's \"Aymara-Sprache\" (1891).\n\nThe first official alphabet to be adopted for Aymara was the Scientific Alphabet. It was approved by the \"III Congreso Indigenista Interamericano de la Paz\" in 1954, though its origins can be traced as far back as 1931. Rs. No 1593 (Deza Galindo 1989, 17). It was the first official record of an alphabet, but in 1914, Sisko Chukiwanka Ayulo and Julián Palacios Ríos had recorded what may be the first of many attempts to have one alphabet for both Quechua and Aymara, the \"Syentifiko Qheshwa-Aymara Alfabeto\" with 37 graphemes.\n\nSeveral other attempts followed, with varying degrees of success. Some orthographic attempts even expand further: the \"Alfabeto Funcional Trilingüe\", made up of 40 letters (including the voiced stops necessary for Spanish) and created by the Academia de las Lenguas Aymara y Quechua in Puno in 1944 is the one used by the lexicographer Juan Francisco Deza Galindo in his \"Diccionario Aymara – Castellano / Castellano – Aymara\". This alphabet has five vowels ⟨a, e, i, o, u⟩, aspiration is conveyed with an ⟨h⟩ next to the consonant, and ejectives with ⟨’⟩. The most unusual characteristic is the expression of the uvular /χ/ with ⟨jh⟩. The other uvular segment, /q/, is expressed by ⟨q⟩, but transcription rules mandate that the following vowel must be ⟨a, e, o⟩ (not ⟨i, u⟩), presumably to account for uvular lowering and to facilitate multilingual orthography.\n\nThe alphabet created by the Comisión de Alfabetización y Literatura Aymara (CALA) was officially recognized in Bolivia in 1968 (co-existing with the 1954 Scientific Alphabet). Besides being the alphabet employed by Protestant missionaries, it is also the one used for the translation of the \"Book of Mormon\". Also in 1968, de Dios Yapita created his take on the Aymara alphabet at the Instituto de Lenga y Cultura Aymara (ILCA).\n\nNearly 15 years later, the \"Servicio Nacional de Alfabetización y Educación Popular\" (SENALEP) attempted to consolidate these alphabets to create a system which could be used to write both Aymara and Quechua, creating what was known as the Alfabeto Unificado. The alphabet, later sanctioned in Bolivia by Decree 20227 on 9 May 1984 and in Peru as la Resolución Ministerial Peruana 1218ED on 18 November 1985, consists of 3 vowels, 26 consonants and an umlaut to mark vowel length. \nIn this standard orthography, the consonants are represented as shown below.\n\nAymara is a highly agglutinative, suffixal language. All suffixes can be categorized into the nominal, verbal, transpositional and those not subcategorized for lexical category (including stem-external word-level suffixes and phrase-final suffixes), as below:\n\n\n\nAll verbs require at least one suffix to be grammatical.\n\n\nA given word can take several transpositional suffixes:\n\nThere are two kinds of suffixes not subcategorized for lexical categories:\n\nLinguistic and gestural analysis by Núñez and Sweetser also asserts that the Aymara have an apparently-unique (or at least very rare) understanding of time. Aymara is, with Quechua, one of very few [Núñez & Sweetser, 2006, p. 403] languages in which speakers seem to represent the past as in front of them and the future as behind them. Their argument is mainly within the framework of conceptual metaphor, which recognizes in general two subtypes of the metaphor \"the passage of time is motion:\" one is \"time passing is motion over a landscape\" (or \"moving-ego\"), and the other is \"time passing is a moving object\" (\"moving-events\"). The latter metaphor does not explicitly involve the individual/speaker. Events are in a queue, with prior events towards the front of the line. The individual may be facing the queue, or it may be moving from left to right in front of him/her.\n\nThe claims regarding Aymara involve the moving-ego metaphor. Most languages conceptualize the ego as moving forward into the future, with ego's back to the past. The English sentences \"prepare for what lies before us\" and \"we are facing a prosperous future\" exemplify the metaphor. In contrast, Aymara seems to encode the past as in front of individuals and the future behind them. That is typologically a rare phenomenon [Núñez & Sweetser, 2006, p. 416].\n\nThe fact that English has words like \"before\" and \"after\" that are (currently or archaically) polysemous between 'front/earlier' or 'back/later' may seem to refute the claims regarding Aymara uniqueness. However, those words relate events to other events and are part of the moving-events metaphor. In fact, when \"before\" means \"in front of ego, it can mean only \"future\". For instance, \"our future is laid out before us while \"our past is behind us\". Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as \"qhipa uru\", literally 'back days', and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua-speakers, whose expression \"qhipa p'unchaw\" corresponds directly to Aymara \"qhipa uru\". Possibly, the metaphor is from the fact that the past is visible (in front of one's eyes), but the future is not.\n\nThere is increasing use of Aymara locally and there are increased numbers learning the language, both Bolivian and abroad. In Bolivia and Peru, intercultural bilingual education programs with Aymara and Spanish have been introduced in the last two decades. There are even projects to offer Aymara through the internet, such as by ILCA.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22840652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22840652", "title": "Cascade Center", "text": "Cascade Center\n\nThe Cascade Center at the Riverplex is an indoor and outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex located in downtown New Castle, Pennsylvania. It opened in 2006. Much of the complex sits on the former site of the Cascade, the first movie theater of the Warner Bros., hence the name. The complex is at the corner of East Washington Street and Mill Street. As of 2013, the complex is owned by Riverplex Partners, Inc. The top three stories are rented by Refresh Dental Management as their corporate headquarters.\n\nThe Warners, residents of nearby Youngstown, Ohio, were sons of Polish Jews wanting to break into the then-fledgling film business. The brothers, after successfully showing a used copy of \"The Great Train Robbery\" at \"Idora Park\" in Youngstown, traveled to New Castle to screen the movie in a vacant store on the site of what would become the Cascade Center. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle near the Bijou, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace, taking its name from nearby Cascade Park. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907.\n\nGradually over time, the building that housed the Bijou would host other business while the Cascade itself would eventually be demolished to make way for a parking lot. The buildings themselves would become abandoned by the 1980s when New Castle, like most other Rust Belt cities, saw the collapse of the steel industry having a ripple effect in the region with the population dropping as well as the general suburbanization effect that had been happening throughout the United States since the 1950s.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, only two businesses were open on the site that would become the Cascade Center. One of them, Main Street Clothiers & Custom Tailors, is a men's suit shop that was housed in the building that also housed the Bijou. The other would be the B&O Railroad Federal Credit Union, a credit union that was in a separate purpose-built building on the site bordering Mill Street and the Neshannock Creek and had actually been built on the site of the Cascade after the site was used as a parking lot.\n\nIn 1996, parts of the wall of the building that housed the Bijou collapsed onto East Washington Street, one of the cities main thoroughfares. The portion that collapsed was next door to Main Street Clothiers, which had just opened three years before on the site. The city of New Castle was very close to issuing a condemnation notice to the building, but at the 11th hour the building's historical significance was discovered, saving the building. The city then announced redevelopment plans to make it what would eventually become the Cascade Center.\n\nThe city took most of the property by eminent domain and stabilized the parts of the wall that had collapsed, closing off the sidewalk in front of the building to prevent accidents until the wall could be completely rebuilt. The city was later able to persuade the B&O Credit Union—now the First Choice Federal Credit Union—to temporarily move into the nearby mall, the Cascade Galleria, so that the property could be bought and made into the Cascade Center. (The credit union eventually moved out of the mall back into their own building out in neighboring Union Township.) Main Street Clothiers was allowed to stay in the building where they remain today, and although their portion of the building is not officially part of the Cascade Center they do advertise in the complex, and have even expanded their business by screen-printing T-shirts as well as serving as the area's J. C. Penney Catalog Center after Rite Aid acquired Eckerd Pharmacy in 2007 and ended the J. C. Penney Catalog Center's in the former Eckerd locations after they were converted to Rite Aid. Coincidentally, Main Street sits next door to a former J. C. Penney (not the side that had the wall collapse) that is currently being remodeled and eventually having a coffee shop open in the building.\n\nAlthough the downtown streets & sidewalks were rebuilt in the early 2000s to resemble the turn of the 19th century, the complex itself wouldn't begin reconstruction until 2003 and was completed in 2006. The interiors of the existing buildings were completely gutted out while the site of the Cascade itself was completely rebuilt into a close replication of the Cascade. Both the old sections and the newly built sections are like one building inside. The city was also able to acquire the former Mellon Bank parking lot and rebuild it as the parking lot for downtown in general and the Cascade Center specifically. The alley that ran along Neshannock Creek behind the buildings was permanently closed and added on to the property of the complex, which became a promenade that leads to an outdoor amphitheater between the former J. C. Penney building and the creek along East Washington Street. The northern terminus of Pennsylvania Route 65 (which runs along East Washington Street) was extended over a mile to near the complex on the other side of the creek.\n\nMuch like Station Square in Pittsburgh, the complex is an example of adaptive reuse, and focuses on the early years of motion pictures much like Station Square focuses on trains. The complex largely remains vacant, although businesses have started to open up and events being held both inside the complex and at the amphitheater. The complex has also help draw businesses to downtown.\n\nDespite the historical connection to the Warner Bros. studio, the complex has no association with Time Warner, the current parent company of Warner Bros. Entertainment. Cass Warner, the granddaughter of Harry Warner, did visit the complex just before it officially opened in 2006.\n\nAlthough at one point the complex had three tenants, in 2010 all three closed for unknown reasons and the complex was put up for sale. The outdoor promenade and amphitheater, which are publicly owned, are still used by the city for downtown events.\nIt should also be noted that Main Street Clothiers and Custom Tailors, while in the building where the Cascade Center is located, is not an official part of the complex, since it has outdoor access only instead of indoor access like the rest of the businesses and also was pre-existing before the creation of the complex.\n\nReinvestment in the center has picked up in recent years, with the Two Rivers Coffee Shop and The Commonwealth restaurant both opening in 2014.\n"}

It was seen as a milestone on the path towards closing the \"emissions gap\" between reduction pledges and the necessary emission cuts for the 2 °C scenario (with \"pursue efforts to\" limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C), and to a new legal agreement on climate change, to be approved by the COP21 in Paris in December 2015. One product of the Summit was the New York Declaration on Forests.\n\nAfter the COP19 in Warsaw, the Climate Summit was the next high-level gathering on climate change. Since the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period expires in 2020, the UNFCCC process attempts to establish a new worldwide contract about climate protection and emission reduction objectives, that is to be drafted in 2014 at the COP20 in Lima and adopted in 2015 at the COP21 in Paris. The Climate Summit in September 2014 is not part of this negotiating process, but is expected to serve as a kick-off for a year of intense activity in climate policy and an indicator on the countries' ambitions to reduce emissions and support climate protection.

Disability in Togo is often seen as a curse or sign of witchcraft, leading to poor outcomes for people with disabilities. Accessibility in the country is lacking. However, Togo has signed onto the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and has created plans to encourage greater inclusion for people with disabilities in the country. \n\nCensus data from 2010 shows that approximately 1.36% of the population of Togo has a disability of some type. Like many other countries in Africa, children in Togo often become disabled due to various complications, disease, poor diet and other causes. \n\nChildren who are born with a disability in Togo, like in some other West African countries, can face violence at home, school or from other members of the community. Disability is seen as a sign of witchcraft and is considered taboo by some communities. Other times, the disability is considered the \"result of a demon in the family.\" Children with disabilities might also face neglect at home. Children born with a physical disability are viewed as \"a non-human spirit,\" by some families. Some parents deliberately keep their children out of school to protect them from abuse there. People with disabilities in Togo in general were considered cursed and that the disability could be contagious. Violence against children with disabilities and their deaths often goes unreported to authorities. Often entire families are ostracized because of one family members' disability.\n\nPeople with mental disabilities in Togo may be chained up in places known as prayer camps. These camps are religious institutions where individuals are restrained, not given psychiatric help and are prayed over in an attempt to heal the individuals. In Togo, there are several prayer camps which use different methods, often based on the camp's head pastors' personality.\n\nThere is a lack of inclusion for people with disabilities in leadership positions in Togo. In 2013, Jérémie Yao Vidja, who is visually impaired, became the first person with a disability to run for elected office in Togo and he was later elected to the Togolese National Assembly.\n\nThe government in Togo signed on to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2011. In 2016, Togo's Ministry of Social Action created a committee dedicated to \"fostering social inclusion for people with disabilities.\" In 2017, Universal Health Coverage was given to all students living in Togo. \n\nTogo's public buildings are still not fully accommodating to people with physical disabilities. In addition, there is no legislation requiring accessibility in public areas. \n\nPeople with disabilities were first allowed to attend public schools in the 1970s. Also in the 1970s, German and American charities set up special-needs schools, focusing on students with visual impairment. By 2014, there were nine schools and centers for children with intellectual disabilities, with most located in Lomé. Also by 2014, schools for those with hearing impairment had been created.\n\nEfforts at including students with disabilities has started to increase. In 2014, there were hundreds of students with various physical disabilities were enrolled in universities around Togo, including 27 visually impaired students at the University of Lomé.\n\nNon governmental organizations recognize that they need to work closely with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education in Togo. Humanity & Inclusion (HI), started a trial program in Togo and other African countries to help produce 3D-printed prosthetic limbs for amputees in need. \n\nParticipating in sports among people with disabilities is increasing, with hundreds participating in various trials in 2013 leading up to the pan-African competitions. Togo sent a Paralympic athlete, Aliou Bawa, to the 2016 Summer Paralympics.\n\n\n"}

Lynsey de Paul devised and presents the program, which provides advice to women on how to maintain their personal safety. She also demonstrates how women can defend themselves from attacks, and interviews women who have been attacked. De Paul reports that 180,000 rapes and sexual assaults are recorded each year in England and Wales, while research in the United States suggests that women can double their chances of avoiding being raped if they resist their attacker. It was first shown on BBC One on 10 August 1992 and repeated on 29 March 1993. The program won a Royal Television Society Award.\n\nDe Paul also produced a video distributed by PolyGram Video and, in 2007, an updated DVD called \"Taking Control\" that provides further instruction with de Paul and John Steadman, a ninth dan ju-jitsu black belt expert, acting out defence strategies as well de Paul presenting facts and figures. The emphasis of the video and DVD is on disabling any assailant for long enough to get away. Confrontation is always the last option, but infinitely preferable to being a passive victim, and the popular view that fighting back increases the risk of serious injury is refuted. The evidence for this was drawn from the work of Dr Pauline Bart at the University of Chicago showing that women who screamed, shouted, resisted were at no greater risk from retaliation by their aggressors, but were more likely to successfully fend off an attacker.\n\nGraham Keal interviewed de Paul for the \"Daily Record\" in 2007 and she is quoted as saying \"\"Don't address the area where he's attacking,\" she said. \"That's might against might, and he's stronger than you. But his main weapons - his arms - are in use while yours are free to attack his vulnerable areas. If you target them quickly, you turn the control around.\" Keal wrote \"It's a persuasive argument which looks even more convincing when you see Lynsey in action. And at a fighting weight of six-and-a-half stone, you realise that if little Lynsey can do it, anyone can\". The video was released in other countries such as Spain and Germany. It was also featured in the official magazine of the British Jujitsu Association and the United Kingdom Taekwando Association \"Fighters: The Martial Arts Magazine\".\n\nLord Mackenzie (Brian Mackenzie, Baron Mackenzie of Framwellgate), former president of the Police Superintendents' Association endorsed the self-defence advice presented by de Paul, saying: \"It is a very positive contribution to crime prevention and the protection of women and I will be recommending it.\"\n\nA book, authored by de Paul and TV producer Claire McCormack, was also published in 1993 entitled \"Taking Control: Basic Mental & Physical Self Defence for Women\" to underscore the lessons presented in \"Eve Strikes Back\" and \"Taking Control\". De Paul also toured schools and universities in order to encourage them to get the self defence techniques included in their curricula.\n\nThe theme music and sound track to this video was written by de Paul and Ian Lynn, with de Paul providing the vocals. The style of the music is more in the vein of her album, \"Just a Little Time\", that was released two years later.\n"}

Its presence has declined in other provinces due to police efforts, internal conflict and increased competition from other crime groups.\"\n\nThe same report stated that Aboriginal street gangs are not as highly organized as other criminal organizations in Canada, but are amongst the most violent. Aboriginal people also constitute a significant portion of prison populations throughout Canada, and the number of First Nation inmates continues to rise at a considerable rate. As of 2005 it is believed over 1000 Aboriginal youths were members of street gangs.\n\nAccording to the Criminal Intelligence Service Canada (CISC), \"The established, well-financed and -connected Hong Kong Triad groups and crime syndicates remain, to our mind, the biggest long-term threat to Canadian law enforcement and society.\"\n\nIn addition to Triad Societies, other Asian criminal groups, such as The Big Circle Gang, have also established national networks based in the major cities of Canada.\n\nKnown crime groups in Abbotsford involve Punjabi street gangs, various East Asian crime groups, motorcycle gangs, and multicultural street gangs.\n\nHowever, there has been a gang conflict in the city mostly in West end part of the city in the Townhill Area. The gang conflict is between two South Asian gangs which involves 40 men in total between the ages of 15 to 25.\n\nAccording to the Abbotsford Youth Crime Prevention Project has assessed groups of people deemed to be most vulnerable to becoming part of a gang in the city.\n\nMajor crime groups in Calgary include Aboriginal street, East Asian (Filipino/Chinese/Vietnamese) street gangs, Middle Eastern/Lebanese organized crime gangs, Punjabi street gangs and Black street gangs, among others are biker gangs, Mexican drug cartels, Somali/Sudanese drug trafficking groups, Afghani Street Gangs and Kashmiri street gangs.\n\nBetween 2002-2009 there was a bloody gang war between two rival East Asian gangs the FK and FOB gangs which resulted in 25 gang related murders. Not only East Asians were involved but there were also White, (East) Indian, and in some cases Black gang members part of these gangs. Disputes over the illegal distribution of fentanyl have broken out within the Middle Eastern community (with some being Lebanese). Similar to the Asian street gangs of the early 2000s, these are not therefore from exclusively one ethnicity.\n\nMajor crime groups in Edmonton have been identified as most being Aboriginal, Black (Central African/Jamaican), Middle Eastern (Somali/Persian/Lebanese), East Asian (Chinese/Vietnamese/Filipino) and Central/Eastern European across a similar broad social spectrum. With other crime groups involved in Edmonton as well such as Hispanic gangs, biker gangs, Aryan Nation groups, and Punjabi street gangs.\n\nHowever recently the arrival of Mexican drug traffickers, along with increased activity by outlaw motorcycle gangs, is changing the face of organized crime in Alberta especially in the major cities of Edmonton along with Calgary.\n\nBiker gangs have, at various points, played a major role in Halifax's crime scene, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s. However, a crackdown on biker gang activity throughout Eastern Canada, in the wake of the Quebec Biker War. Most biker gangs are composed of extended families or of close associates, providing little scope for recruitment or promotion from outside. The well-known Bloods and Crips have been part of Halifax's gang environment as well.\n\nThe area in and around Hamilton was once home to organized crime figure Rocco Perri, so-called \"Canada's Al Capone\", and Johnny \"Pops\" Papalia. Murders of traditional mobsters in 2017 and 2018 indicate that the group is still active. After the September 2018 killing of real estate agent Al Iavarone, police sources told the Toronto Star that the hit was in retaliation for previous actions against the Musitano crime family as part of a \"dispute between two Niagara Region groups of mobsters who are both tied to the New York State [Buffalo] mob. A news report stated that \"there has been a resurgence of mafia-related crime in the greater Toronto and Hamilton areas in the last couple of years, leading police to believe there may be a 'power struggle'\".\n\nGangs in Montreal are mostly Caucasian (most Italian, French, Irish and Russian) but there are minority gangs which are mostly of Jamaican, Haitian, Hispanic, Lebanese, Asian, Sri Lankan, or Cambodian descent. United smaller street gangs made up of mostly youths are pocketed in different areas of the Montreal area, particularly in Montréal-Nord, St-Michel, Parc-Extension, Ville Saint-Laurent(St-Low), Côte-des-Neiges, NDG, Rivière-des-Prairies, Saint-Francois, Laval and St-Léonard neighbourhoods.\n\nMajor crime groups in Ottawa involve White/Irish gangs, Biker gangs, Arab street gangs, and East Asian crime groups. Many other crime groups also exist mainly Lebanese and Somali. In Ottawa, by the early twentieth-century, drive by shootings were rare and most gang activity involved narcotic distribution, by the Barleton Bloods.\n\nAdult gangs in Saskatchewan are almost entirely aboriginal based. The largest gang activity is in Regina and Saskatoon. There is also a branch of the Hells Angels in the province. Youth gangs are also almost entirely aboriginal based. Saskatchewan had the highest concentration of gang membership in Canada at 1.34 per 1000 in 2002 There are possibly 108 street gangs for the Prairie region.\n\nCertain neighbourhoods in Toronto have experienced gang and organized crime activity including human trafficking, firearm trafficking, drug trafficking, robbery, and Mafia/mob activity.\n\nA police survey found that most youth gangs in Ontario and the GTA are ethnically African/Caribbean (Somali/Jamaican/Haitian/Guyanese), Caucasian (Italian/Russian/Portuguese/Albanian/Polish/Greek/Spanish), and South Asian (Indian/Punjabi/Pakistani/Tamil). There are also a number of Asian (Filipino/Chinese-Tibetan/Vietnamese/Cambodian/Korean) and Latino gangs in the area. Other minor groups are Biker gangs, Supremacist groups, and Mexican drug cartels, Middle Eastern (Persian/Afghan) gangs and Aboriginal street gangs.\n\nAlthough Toronto's murder rate remains low, there has been a recent rise in gun violence in the downtown core of the greater Toronto area. The two most focal incidents were the Boxing Day shooting, a shootout between rival gangs that resulted in the death of 15-year-old bystander Jane Creba on December 26, 2005 on Yonge Street, and a mall food court shooting at the Eaton Centre on June 2, 2012, which left two dead and injured seven others, including a 13-year-old boy. Hassan was considered to be the targeted victim and is considered to be gang-affiliated while others were considered innocent bystanders.\n\nIn June 2015, RCMP led police raids across the Greater Toronto Area, named Project OPhoenix, which resulted in the arrest of 19 men, allegedly affiliated with the 'Ndrangheta. Testimony during the trial revealed that the crime group was still very active as recently as 2015, with activities in mortgage and bank fraud as well as cocaine trafficking.\n\nIn June 2018, Cosimo Ernesto Commisso, of Woodbridge, Ontario and an unrelated woman were shot and killed. According to sources contacted by the Toronto Star, \"Commisso was related to Cosimo \"The Quail\" Commisso of Siderno, Italy, who has had relations in Ontario, is considered by police to be a \"'Ndrangheta organized crime boss\".\n\nDuring the investigation of the apparent mob hit of Albert Iavarone in September 2018, a Police investigator made this comment. \"If you look back over the last couple years there has been a number of murders, a number of bombings, a number of arsons throughout the GTA and up to as far as Montreal. It is our belief that there is something going on in the underworld. We are not sure if this particular case factors into that but is something we are alive to\".\n\nKnown crime groups in Brampton include mainly South Asian and Black gangs but there are a few White, Portuguese, and Filipino gangs in the city. Members in SPG(Springdale) are 85% Punjabi, 10% Pakistani, 5% Tamil, while TGOD(Turner) was made up of 90% Punjabi and 10% Pakistani. Current feuds in the city have led to alliances such as Northside and TGORE, with Northside being made up of SPG, F-block(Fletchers), NPG(North Park Gang) and MLT(Malton), TGORE is made up of TGOD, Swood, Gore and Ray Lawson. Most areas are claimed by the Punjabi gangs and racial tensions between gang members in the city are mostly between South Asians and Blacks and to a less extent with Afghans feuding with Pakistanis such as KNK and AFG. Most black gangs in the city claim Crip and are gang members formerly living in Toronto and moving to Brampton townhouse complexes and apartments. Several alliances between notorious drug dealers such as Young Plug and Crip Fueler are also considered a gang (Gore Rippers). Many of the identities of the Gore Rippers is unknown, but they are well respected within the community. Young Plug is known to have gone ghost in 2012, but it is rumoured he has resurfaced in early 2017.\n\nThere are dozens of tribes of gangs in Scarborough, but the most common ones that are seen are the Afghan street gangs, Tamil street gangs, Chinese street gangs, and West Indian (Caribbean) street gangs.\n\nAccording to law enforcement agencies, the most significant crime groups in Vancouver are the motorcycle gangs (such as the Hells Angels), East Asian street gangs (mostly Vietnamese drug gangs/Asian-Chinese Triads), and Punjabi street gangs, although others exist (mainly Eastern European, Persian, or Italian Based groups) Other minor crime groups quite often Mexican drug cartels, and Aboriginal street gangs are also seen in the metro area. However, in recent years, \"multicultural\" street gangs have grown significantly in power and prominence, and have attained much media attention due to their involvement in numerous shootings and slayings throughout the city, including the 2009 Vancouver gang war.\n\nAccording to the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit of British Columbia the ethnicities of people who died from a total of 160 gang related deaths in British Columbia between January 2006 to March 2014 were:\n\n▸ Caucasian/White (74 victims; 46.3%)\n\n▸ South Asian (predominantly Punjabis) (34 victims; 21.3%)\n\n▸ East Asian (most Chinese or Vietnamese) (33 victims; 20.6%)\n\n▸ Middle Eastern (mostly Persian) (10 victims; 6.3%)\n\n▸ First Nations (6 victims; 3.8%)\n\n▸ Hispanic (3 victims; 1.9%)\n\n▸ African/Caribbean (0 victims; 0%)\n\nMajor crime groups in the city are the South Asian (predominantly Punjabi) street gangs, East Asian (mainly Vietnamese) street gangs, biker gangs. Gangs have operated in Surrey, leading to an increase in the murder rate, although this almost ceased; the police claimed this was because the perpetrators had left the country. Most gangs within the city today battle out in Surrey's Newton community, predominantly but inexclusively amongst the South Asian community.\n\nCriminal gangs in Burnaby are composed of elements of most ethnic groupings within Vancouver.\n\nWinnipeg's gang activity consists heavily of Aboriginal criminals, with a smaller number of other ethnic groups namely European, East Asian (Filipino/Vietnamese) and African gangs; it has been described as the Aboriginal gang capital of Canada.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30249620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30249620", "title": "Human trafficking in Guatemala", "text": "Human trafficking in Guatemala\n\nGuatemala is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically sexual servitude and forced labor. Guatemalan women and children are found in forced prostitution within the country, as well as in Mexico and the United States. Guatemalan men, women, and children are subjected to forced labor within the country, often in agriculture or domestic service, and particularly near the border with Mexico and in the highland region. Guatemalan men, women, and children are also found in conditions of forced labor in Mexico and the United States in agriculture and the garment industry. Indigenous Guatemalans are particularly vulnerable to labor exploitation. In the Mexican border area, Guatemalan children are exploited for forced begging on streets and forced labor in municipal dumps. Guatemala is a destination country for women and girls from El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in forced prostitution. Migrants from these Central American countries transit through Guatemala en route to Mexico and the United States; some may become human trafficking victims. Child sex tourism is a problem in certain tourist areas such as Antigua and Lake Atitlan, and child sex tourists predominately come from Canada, Germany, Spain, and the United States. The border with Mexico remains a top concern due to the heavy flow of irregular migrants, some of whom are trafficked.\n\nThe Government of Guatemala does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these significant efforts, including prosecuting its first trafficking cases under the recent anti-trafficking law and establishing a new anti-trafficking office, the government did not show overall evidence of increasing efforts to address human trafficking through providing adequate victim services or addressing official complicity in trafficking; therefore, Guatemala is placed on Tier 2, for the fourth consecutive year. Despite the significant number of foreign trafficking victims identified by the government, foreign victims were not generally offered asylum or temporary residency, although the anti-trafficking law provides that authority. As such, most foreign trafficking victims were deported or required to remain in locked migrant detention facilities with no access to specialized victim services. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2 Watchlist\" in 2017.\n\nThe government maintained anti-human trafficking law enforcement efforts during the last year and achieved its first convictions under its new anti-trafficking law. Article 202 of the Guatemalan penal code, which came into force in early 2009, prohibits the transport, transfer, retention, harboring, or reception of persons for the purposes of exploitation, including forced prostitution, sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, begging, slavery, illegal adoptions, or forced marriage, in addition to other prohibited purposes. Penalties prescribed under Article 202 are from eight to 18 years’ imprisonment; under aggravated circumstances, such as when the crime involves kidnapping, threats, violence, weapons, or a public official, penalties increase by one-third. Such penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes such as rape. Many trafficking cases, however, continued to be prosecuted under other statutes, such as corruption of minors or pandering, that carry lesser sentences. The government maintained a small prosecutorial unit to investigate and prosecute human trafficking cases; approximately 60 percent of this unit’s investigations focused on illegal adoptions, which do not fall within the international definition of human trafficking. During the reporting period, authorities achieved seven convictions for human trafficking offenses, four of which were charged under the new anti-trafficking law, and one of which related to forced labor; sentences ranged from three to eight years’ imprisonment. In comparison, during the previous year, the Guatemalan government reported no convictions for human trafficking offenses. Anti-trafficking police and prosecutors suffered from a lack of funding, resources, and training. Credible reports from international organizations, NGOs, and several government officials indicated that corrupt public officials continued to impede anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts and facilitated trafficking activity by accepting or extorting bribes, falsifying identity documents, leaking information about impending police raids to suspected traffickers, and ignoring trafficking activity in commercial sex sites. The government did not report prosecuting or convicting any officials complicit in human trafficking, although one congressman accused of corruption of children was stripped of his immunity. Guatemalan authorities collaborated with foreign governments on several trafficking investigations.\n\nAlthough Guatemalan authorities reported rescuing 387 suspected trafficking victims during the reporting period, the government made insufficient efforts to protect trafficking victims, relying largely on NGOs and international organizations to provide the bulk of victim services. In spite of existing protocols for identifying trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, such as brothel workers, there was no evidence that these were implemented systematically or proactively. Government-funded services dedicated to trafficking victims remained virtually non-existent, and authorities provided no funding or subsidies to organizations that provided these services. Child victims were referred to one NGO-operated shelter dedicated for girl trafficking victims, or placed in state-run group homes designed for orphans or homeless children. The government sought to place adult victims in shelters for victims of domestic violence operated by NGOs or religious groups, but these shelters were overburdened and underfunded. Of the 387 trafficking victims identified, 326 were adult women, and most foreign adult victims were placed in migration detention centers without freedom of movement or access to specialized victim services. Although Guatemalan authorities encouraged victims to assist with the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, most victims did not file complaints due to fear of violence or reprisals and the inadequacy of the government’s limited witness protection program. A recent advisory opinion issued by the Supreme Court allowing for victim testimony via video could improve low rates of victim participation in prosecutions. The government did not detain, fine, or otherwise penalize victims for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Many foreign trafficking victims, however, may not have had their victim status recognized by Guatemalan authorities before being deported as undocumented migrants. Guatemalan law establishes legal alternatives to removal of foreign victims who may face hardship or retribution upon repatriation. The authorities offered these alternatives on a case by case basis, but provided no evidence that any victims had accepted. In practice, any victim choosing to remain in Guatemala under an alternative legal status must stay in the closed migration detention center. Guatemalan consular officials in the United States and Mexico received training sessions on trafficking legislation and victim services. The government assisted in the repatriation of 14 Guatemalan trafficking victims from abroad and provided some care services to these victims, 12 of whom were children.\n\nThe government sustained efforts to prevent trafficking during the reporting period. In collaboration with an international organization, the government carried out a public awareness campaign using radio announcements about trafficking in persons in seven departments near the Mexican border. The government conducted workshops on the commercial sexual exploitation of children in 20 public schools. During the reporting period the government established the Secretariat Against Sexual Violence, Exploitation and Trafficking in Persons to coordinate the government’s anti-trafficking efforts; however, this office received under five percent of the designated funding and subsequently took no discernible actions beyond evaluating current government efforts. Despite reports of child sex tourism, there were no reported prosecutions of child sex tourists. The government made no discernible efforts to reduce demand for forced labor or commercial sexual acts. Authorities provided training on human trafficking to Guatemalan troops prior to their deployment for international peacekeeping operations.\n"}
{"id": "36916753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36916753", "title": "Intimization", "text": "Intimization\n\nIntimization is \"a revelatory process which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as [an individuals’s] personal life – broadly defined. It is a publicity process (involving the media) that takes place over time and involves flows of personal information and imagery into the [media]\". It has mainly been studied as a society wide process in the context of politics although it can apply to other contexts.\n\nThe term intimization was first used and defined as a process by Van Zoonen in her study of Dutch television news in the 1980s. She defines it as a process whereby \"values from the private sphere are transferred to the public sphere\". This is seen not only in the greater focus on ‘human interest subjects’ but also in \"the way the relation between audience and news reader is constructed... through carefully picked personalities and intimate modes of address\".\n\nHirdman et al. use the term in their study of changes in Swedish journalism from the 1880s. They define intimization as a process which sees increased journalistic attention on the family, sexuality and the private, what they term the ‘intimate sphere’ as opposed to the public sphere. They suggest that \"modes of address, relations to sources, visual representations and focus of texts are seen to interact to create a kind of medial pseudo intimacy.\"\n\nThe term privatization has sometimes also been used to signify the same process. Rahat and Sheafer, for example, define privatization as \"a media focus on the personal characteristics and personal life of individual candidates.\" However, the use of this term is problematic as the word, most commonly associated the sale of state-owned assets, means the reverse, privatizing of something that is public not publicizing the private.\n\nStanyer argues that Intimization as a process relates primarily to media content formation and dissemination in any society and should not be conflated with para-social or tele-mediated intimacy between audiences and those who appear on TV. Horton and Wohl, writing in the 1950s were particularly interested in the relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen. Horton and Wohl were not interested in the information and imagery to which audience members were exposed and made no distinction between the public and private matters but were rather interested in their illusory (para-social) relationship between audience members and those they saw on the TV screen. While not downplaying the importance of the audience, Stanyer observes it is the information and imagery to which an audience is exposed that is important in the intimization process. It is the mass exposure of information and imagery from what we might ordinarily understand as the personal / private life of a public figure as opposed to their public/ professional life. Information and imagery we might expect only to be exchanged between those in a close relationship. In other words, public figures (politicians, celebrities, sports stars etc.) are not just familiar to us (that is recognisable) but potentially more information about their personal life circulates in the media, and the audience are exposed to more information from the private lives of public figures. An important distinction is made in this respect between familiarity and intimacy.\n\nStanyer suggests that flows of information can come from three specific areas or domains of the personal life. ‘The first domain concerns the ‘inner life’ of [a person]. This includes, for example, his or her health, well being, sexuality, personal finances, deeds, misdeeds, key milestones (such as birthdays), life experiences and achievements, but also choices about the way an individual wants to live his or her life: for example, life-style choices, ways of behaving, choice of religion or questions of taste. The second domain concerns significant others in a person’s personal life and his or her relationship with these actors. This includes relationships with partners, other immediate and extended family members, friends and extra-marital lovers. The third domain concerns an individual’s life space: this includes his or her home but it also includes happenings in locations outside the home where the individual is not performing a public function and might want privacy, such as on family holidays’\n\nWhile Stanyer observes that intimization consists of \"the publicizing of information and imagery from these three domains,\" he also notes such information can enter the public sphere with or without expressed or implied consent of those in public life and can either be scandalous in nature (it reveals a transgression of societal norms) or non-scandalous. An example of the former \"might be an act of self-disclosure on a talk show or in an autobiography which is then recycled in the media.\" Example of the latter \"might include, paparazzi photographs of politicians backstage or off-duty, taken without the subject’s permission\" revealing an extra-marital affair\n\nIn sum, drawing on these definitions initimization can be seen as a society wide ‘revelatory process’ which involves the publicizing of information and imagery from the different domains of public figures’ personal lives, either with or without expressed or implied consent of the individual involved.\n\nThe growing visibility of the private lives of public figures has been much commented on but has received little systematic attention. The findings that emerge are somewhat mixed. Errera analyzed coverage of French politicians’ private lives in two magazines \"Paris Match\" and \"VSD\" over a seven-year period between 1990 and 1997. She found that politicians’ relationships, personal health, their home and family life, personal financial issues and their past life were very much to the fore in the magazines’ coverage especially of leading French politicians, such as, Jacques Chirac and François Mitterrand.\n\nIn terms of newspaper articles referring to UK national leaders’ personal lives, Langer found a clear upward trend over time. The coverage of their private lives rose from around 1% of the leader’s coverage in 1945 to 8% during Tony Blair’s tenure in office (2007). A follow up study (period 2007-2008) showed that the coverage of opposition leader David Cameron was even more focused on his private life than that of Tony Blair, while that of Prime Minister Gordon Brown was less, suggesting the importance of specific leaders for the amount of attention their private life receives.\n\nHowever, Rahat and Sheafer, who looked at election coverage in two leading Israeli newspapers for 16 campaigns between 1949 and 2003, found no significant trend in media coverage of candidates’ personal life, with the focus on personal life never exceeding 15% of the news items over time.\n\nThe only comparative research conducted so far by Stanyer found some interesting cross national differences. Looking at non-scandalous and scandalous media coverage in seven democracies (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK and the US) the research found that intimization is more prevalent in the UK and US compared to the other countries. Stanyer argues that there is no magic causal silver bullet, such as, new communication technologies, or tabloidization that can explain the difference between countries. Rather, the outcome is the result of a complex interplay of necessary and sufficient factors operating in conjunction. These include: personal factors including the age of the politician, media conditions, such as the size of the tabloid press and presence and absence of privacy protection for public figures, and political factors, such as the nature of the political system.\n"}

{"id": "12082612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12082612", "title": "Jennings Dog", "text": "Jennings Dog\n\nThe Jennings Dog (also known as The Duncombe Dog or The Dog of Alcibiades) is a Roman sculpture of a dog with a docked tail. Named for its first modern owner, Henry Constantine Jennings, it is a 2nd-century AD Roman copy of a Hellenistic bronze original. The original was probably of the 2nd century BC. It is high; its leonine muzzle and one leg have been repaired since its rediscovery. Though it is one of only a few animal sculptures surviving from antiquity, a pair of similar marble mastiffs of the same model can be seen in the Belvedere Court of the Vatican Museums.\n\nIt is identified at the British Museum as a Molossian guard dog. The Molossian breed was native to Epirus in northwestern Greece, which was sacked by Rome in 168 BC, so it is assumed to have been associated with some civic monument in Epirus, and to have been brought to Rome. Pliny mentions a highly valued bronze dog surviving in Rome into his lifetime, before being lost in 69 AD:\n\nThe stone sculpture was discovered at Monte Cagnuolo, near the ancient Lanuvium, the site of an imperial villa of Antoninus Pius, 32 km southeast of Rome, where it was probably made; its first modern owner was the sculptor, restorer and dealer in antiquities Bartolomeo Cavaceppi. Henry Constantine Jennings saw it in a pile of rubble in Cavaceppi's workshop in Rome between 1753 and 1756, bought it from him for 400 scudi, and took it back to Britain.\n\nThe sculpture became famous on its arrival in Britain, praised by Horace Walpole among a scant handful of masterly Roman sculptures of animals, with replicas that were thought to make \"a most noble appearance in a gentleman's hall\", in Dr Johnson's words.\n\nA story in Plutarch's life of Alcibiades tells of the statesman owning a large, handsome dog whose tail Alcibiades cut off so as to invoke pity from the Athenians and distract them from his worse deeds. The broken tail of this sculpture led Jennings to link it to this story, calling it \"the dog of Alcibiades\"; under this title a pair of copies in Portland stone were installed by Robert Adam at Newby Hall, Yorkshire, about 1780, and in the later 19th century a pair in cast stone were set in the gardens at Basildon Park, Bedfordshire. A 19th-century pair carved in serpentine were sold by Bonham's, London, in 2005.\n\nIn settlement of his gambling debts in 1778, Jennings was forced to sell the sculpture, stating \"A fine dog it was, and a lucky dog was I to purchase it\". The dog was soon afterwards sold at Phillips for £1000 to the Rt Hon Charles Duncombe. James Boswell records a conversation between Johnson and other members of the Literary Club, around the time of the statue's sale, in which Edmund Burke exclaimed \"A thousand guineas! The representation of no animal whatever is worth so much\", to which Dr Johnson replied \"Sir, it is not the worth of the thing, but the skill in forming it, which is so highly estimated. Every thing that enlarges the sphere of human powers, that shews man he can do what he thought he could not do, is valuable.\"\n\nFor 150 years the sculpture stood guard in the entrance hall of Duncombe Park, the family mansion in Yorkshire; it was enthusiastically described there in 1859: \"Among the statues in this apartment is particularly noticed an excellent antique sculpture, representing the Dog of Alcibiades, said to be the work of Myron, a Grecian sculptor\". It remained there, away from public view, until 1925. In that year, inheritance taxes forced the Duncombes to rent out the hall to Queen Mary's School for Girls, whose pupils were rumoured to feed the dog unwanted Marmite sandwiches.\n\nIt was finally sold by Thomas Duncombe's descendent Charles Anthony Peter Duncombe, 6th Baron Feversham, in 2001. Initially the Houston Museum, Texas, USA attempted to purchase it (the sculpture had been shown in the US in the 1980s), at the price of $950,000, but the granting of an export licence was deferred by the UK government. The Heritage Lottery Fund, National Art Collections Fund, British Museum Friends, Duthie Fund, Ready Bequest, Caryatid Fund, Mrs Barbara G. Fleischman, Mr Frank A. Ladd and the Ready Bequest had already pledged funds to help \"save it for the nation\". With the sculpture on temporary display in its Great Court, the delay on the export allowed the British Museum enough time to raise the remaining £662,297 through a public appeal, and thus to acquire it permanently. It is now on permanent display in gallery 22 of the Museum, B. 2001.1010.1.\n\n"}

{"id": "4539801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4539801", "title": "Languages of Eritrea", "text": "Languages of Eritrea\n\nThe main languages spoken in Eritrea are Tigrinya, Tigre and Modern Standard Arabic. Linguistic demography is uncertain due to a lack of reliable official statistics. SIL Ethnologue estimates that as of 2010, there are 3,360,000 speakers of Tigrinya and 1,390,000 speakers of Tigre. The remaining residents primarily speak other languages from the Afroasiatic family, with a minority speaking Nilo-Saharan or Indo-European languages.\n\nAccording to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the Neolithic period from the family's proposed urheimat (\"original homeland\") in the Nile Valley, or the Near East. Other scholars propose that the Afro-Asiatic family developed in situ in the Horn, with its speakers subsequently dispersing from there.\n\nEritrea's population now comprises nine ethnic groups, most of whom speak languages from the Semitic and Cushitic branches of the Afro-Asiatic family.\n\nEstimates of numbers of speakers given below are from SIL Ethnologue unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe South Semitic (North Ethopic) languages spoken in Eritrea are Tigrinya, Tigre, and Dahlik (formerly considered a dialect of Tigre). Together, they are spoken by around 70% of local residents:\n\nOther Afro-Asiatic languages belonging to the family's Cushitic branch are also spoken in the country. They are spoken by around 10% of residents and include:\nIn addition, languages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan language family are spoken as a mother tongue by the Kunama and Nara Nilotic ethnic minorities that live in the north and northwestern part of the country. Around 187,000 individuals speak the Kunama language, while around 81,400 people speak the Nara language. As of 2006, this corresponds with around 3.5% and 1.5%, respectively, of total residents. \nArabic is mostly found in the form of Modern Standard Arabic as an educational language taught in primary and secondary schools, but there are native speakers of dialectal variants of Arabic, as follows:\n\nItalian was introduced in the 19th century by the colonial authorities in Italian Eritrea but is now used in commerce at times. It serves as the mother tongue of very few Italian Eritreans. English was introduced in the 1940s under the British military administration of Italian Eritrea. It is now used as the de facto working language.\n\nThe 1997 Constitution of Eritrea does not define any official languages. It states that \"the equality of all Eritrean languages is guaranteed\" without providing a conclusive list of the languages in question. The CIA Factbook cites Tigrinya, Arabic and English as official languages, alongside ethnic Eritrean languages like Tigre, Afar and other Cushitic languages, as well as the Nilo-Saharan Kunama. SIL Ethnologue lists Tigrinya as the de facto language of national identity, Arabic as the de facto national language, and English as the de facto working language. The Eritrean embassy in Sweden says, \"The main working languages are Tigrigna and Arabic. English is the medium of instruction from middle school level upwards.\"\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Information of Eritrea, an estimated 80% of the country's population is literate.\n\nIn terms of writing systems, Eritrea's principal orthography is Ge'ez, Latin script and Arabic script. Ge'ez is employed as an abugida for the two most spoken languages in the country: Tigrinya and Tigre. It first came into usage in the 6th and 5th centuries BC as an abjad to transcribe the Semitic Ge'ez language. Ge'ez now serves as the liturgical language of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churches. The Latin script is used to write the majority of the country's other languages excluding Arabic. The Arabic script has also been used to write Afar, Beja, Saho and Tigre in the past. However, Tigre is mostly written in Ge'ez script now while the Latin script is used to write the other languages. For example, \"Qafar Feera\", a modified Latin script, serves as an orthography for transcribing Afar.\n\n"}

Her signature song, the platinum-certified 1982 single \"Gloria\", stayed on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for 36 weeks, then a record for a female artist, peaking at No. 2. It also reached number one in Australia and Canada. In 1984, she reached number one in Canada and Germany with the U.S. No. 4 hit \"Self Control\". She also had success in the United Kingdom with both \"Gloria\" and \"Self Control\" making the Top 10 there.\n\nBranigan's other singles included the Top 10 hit \"Solitaire\" (1983), the U.S. AC chart number one \"How Am I Supposed to Live Without You\" (1983), the Australian No. 2 hit \"Ti Amo\" (1984), and \"The Power of Love\" (1987). Her most successful album was 1984's platinum-selling \"Self Control\". She also contributed songs to motion picture and television soundtracks, including the Grammy and Academy Award-winning \"Flashdance\" soundtrack (1983), and the \"Ghostbusters\" soundtrack (1984). In 1985, she won the Tokyo Music Festival with the song \"The Lucky One\". She died at her home in 2004 from a previously-undiagnosed cerebral aneurysm.\n\nLaura Ann Branigan was born on July 3, 1952 in the village of Brewster, New York, fourth of five children of Kathleen O'Hare Branigan (1921–2006) and James Branigan, Sr. (1914–1984), an account executive and mutual funds broker; they later separated. Branigan's maternal grandparents were William O'Hare, Jr. (son of William John O'Hare and Agnes B. O'Connor) and Mary Conway (daughter of Francis J. Conway and Mary Teresa McGuiness); all of them were Irish.\n\nBranigan attended Byram Hills High School in 1966 to 1970, starring in the high school musical \"The Pajama Game\" in her senior year. Between 1970 and 1972 she attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, and worked as a waitress. In 1972 she met acoustic guitarist Walker Daniels and his future wife Sharon Storm, and acoustic guitarist Chris Van Cleave, forming the folk-rock band \"Meadow\" (named as a good place for Paul McCartney's band \"Wings\" to land in). In 1973 the group, with bass player Bob Valdez, released their debut album \"The Friend Ship\", featuring the singles \"When You Were Young\", and \"Cane and Able\", which featured the hook line \"Throw away your cane and you are able\". The record was not properly promoted and never re-released. The band broke up, after which Walker Daniels committed suicide. Branigan preferred not to discuss her involvement with Meadow publicly.\n\nDuring the years after Meadow broke up, Branigan had various jobs, including a stint as one of Leonard Cohen's backup singers for his European tour in April–August 1976.\n\nIn December 1978 after meeting him at a party in Manhattan, New York earlier in the year, Branigan married Larry Ross Kruteck (1936–1996), a lawyer some years her senior, who died of colon cancer on June 15, 1996.\n\nIn 1979, after a chance meeting with manager Sid Bernstein on her return from Europe, Branigan was signed by Ahmet Ertegun to Atlantic Records. The strength and range of her voice actually impeded her career for several years while the label went through the process of categorizing her as a pop singer, and her 1981 single \"Looking Out for Number One\", from her unreleased album \"Silver Dreams\", made a brief appearance on the U.S. dance chart, reaching No. 60. Two other early Atlantic singles, \"Tell Him\" and \"Fool's Affair\", followed. None of these three singles (or the B-side, \"When\") were included on her first album, but all four songs were eventually released on CD over 30 years later in 2014 as bonus cuts on a U.S. CD reissue of Branigan's first album. \nBranigan's 9-track debut album, \"Branigan\", was released in March 1982. The first single from the album was \"All Night with Me\", which reached No. 69 on the \"Billboard\" charts in early 1982. The album alternated four energetic up-tempo songs with five ballads, including one of the few songs written solely by Branigan, \"I Wish We Could Be Alone\". \"Gloria\", an Italian love song recorded in 1979 by Umberto Tozzi and successful in several European countries, was released as the album's second single. Branigan's version was reworked with Tozzi's own arranger, Greg Mathieson, who updated its production with fellow producer Jack White to give it what Branigan called \"an American kick\" to match the new English lyrics. U.S. radio stations were initially unreceptive to \"Gloria\" but after it was embraced by dance clubs it eventually won them over, becoming one of the biggest hits of the 1980s. The album went gold, and the single was eventually certified platinum (sales of more than two million U.S. copies).\n\nBranigan's performance of \"Gloria\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance alongside Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John, Juice Newton and that year's winner, Melissa Manchester, becoming her only solo nomination. \n\nIn the spring of 1983 Branigan released her second album \"Branigan 2\". Branigan's vocals propelled her English-language version of the French song \"Solitaire\" toward the top of the U.S. charts. The original \"Solitaire\" was written and recorded in 1981 by French singer-songwriter Martine Clemenceau. Two songs included on the album began the careers for two then-unknowns: the English translation of \"Solitaire\" was the first major hit for songwriter Diane Warren, while the ballad \"How Am I Supposed to Live Without You\" was the first major hit for its co-writer, Michael Bolton. Branigan's version reached No. 12 on the hot 100 and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" adult contemporary chart.\n\nDuring the height of her career, Branigan also made acting appearances, first in 1981 in \"An American Girl in Berlin\" for West German television, and then after the success of \"Gloria\", guest appearances on American television series such as \"CHiPs\" (\"Fox Trap\", season 6, episode 16, in which she played Sarah, lead singer of the female rock band Cadillac Foxes), \"Automan\" and \"Knight Rider\". She would later appear in independent films including \"Mugsy's Girls\" (aka \"Delta Pi\", 1985) with Academy Awards winner Ruth Gordon, and the Australian film \"Backstage\". She sang on major national television and radio campaigns for products including Dr Pepper, Coca-Cola and Chrysler, which sponsored her 1985–1986 \"Hold Me\" tour.\n\nThe year 1984 was the height of the European synthpop era, and \"Self Control\", the title track of Branigan's third album, released in April 1984 became her biggest hit internationally, topping the charts in over six countries, most notably West Germany, where it spent six weeks at No. 1. The original version. recorded a few months earlier in 1984 by one of the song's co-writers Raffaele Riefoli under the name \"Raf\" held the West German number 2 spot during this time period; outside of Raf's native Italy, Branigan's version enjoyed more success, hitting No. 4 in the U.S. The song was featured on episode #8 of the first season of the TV series \"Miami Vice\" titled \"The Great McCarthy\", which aired on November 16, 1984.\n\nOther pop, disco, and adult contemporary hits from Branigan's \"Self Control\" album include \"The Lucky One\" (which won her a Tokyo Music Festival prize), the continental ballad \"Ti Amo\" (another Umberto Tozzi hit, and a No. 2 hit in Australia for Branigan) and the dance hit \"Satisfaction\". The album also featured an understated version of Carole King's \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\"; as a counterpoint to all the dance productions, it was a bare-bones piano version. (In concerts and television appearances throughout her career, Branigan accompanied herself on the piano for the song.)\n\nBranigan's vocal coach was Carlo Menotti, and she worked with Steve Lukather (Toto), Dann Huff (Giant) and Michael Landau; keyboardists Greg Mathieson, Harold Faltermeyer, Michael Boddicker and Robbie Buchanan; bassists Nathan East and Dennis Belfield (Rufus); drummers Carlos Vega and Doane Perry (Jethro Tull); percussionists Paulinho Da Costa and Lenny Castro; and guest vocalists including Joe \"Bean\" Esposito and background vocalists including The Waters Sisters (Maxine and Julia), James Ingram, and Richard Page and Stephen George (Mr. Mister). As her stature grew, she attracted Grammy-winning producers including Phil Ramone, Richard Perry and David Kershenbaum. She performed duets with John Farnham as well as Latin pop artist Luis Miguel.\n\nIn 1984 Branigan's live show was recorded twice, for a syndicated radio concert series and a concert video. Branigan was also nominated for an award at the American Music Awards of 1985 for favorite pop/rock female video artist, won by Cyndi Lauper. Also in 1985 Branigan performed the main theme song for the television mini-series \"Hollywood Wives\", based on the novel by Jackie Collins.\n\nBy the time Branigan's fourth album \"Hold Me\" was released in July 1985, \"Self Control\" was a worldwide success. The hits continued with \"Spanish Eddie\", which was her sixth U.S. \"Billboard\" top 40 pop hit in two and a half years. The subsequent single release \"Hold Me\" was a U.S. top-40 dance hit, and Branigan's introduction of the rock ballad \"I Found Someone\" (co-written by Michael Bolton, a later hit for Cher) scored even higher on the adult contemporary chart. However, neither song was supported by a music video and stalled at the low end of the hot 100 chart. On June 13, 1985 Branigan made her fourth appearance on legendary TV music show \"American Bandstand\", performing \"Spanish Eddie\" and \"Hold Me\". On July 4, 1985 she performed in Point State Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nBranigan's fifth album \"Touch\" (released July 7, 1987) marked a change in her career. Under new management and using different producers, Branigan took a more active role in her work and in the studio, seeing her return to dance floors with the Stock-Aitken-Waterman-produced track \"Shattered Glass\" written by Bob Mitchell and Steve Coe, of the band Monsoon. \"Shattered Glass\" was performed by Branigan on the last episode of \"American Bandstand\" (hosted by Dick Clark) to be broadcast on ABC (the show would last for two more years, first in first-run syndication and finally on the USA Network) on September 5, 1987, becoming their last guest performer. The album also included a return to the Billboard top-40 with her cover of Jennifer Rush's \"Power of Love\", which was one of the 20 bestselling singles in the U.S. during the Christmas season. The album's third single \"Cry Wolf\", a top-30 AC hit, did not capture the attention of pop radio stations and stalled; the ballad was recorded two years later by Stevie Nicks, and more recently by writer Jude Johnstone.\n\nBranigan's sixth album, \"Laura Branigan\" (March 21, 1990), brought her back to the Hi-NRG charts and gay clubs with \"Moonlight On Water\", and she scored a top-30 adult contemporary hit with \"Never in a Million Years.\" Branigan added production to her list of credits with her cover of Vicki Sue Robinson's disco-era \"Turn the Beat Around\" and the atmospheric \"Let Me In,\" a cover of an Eddie Money song. The album also includes '\"Unison,\" which was the title track for Céline Dion's English debut CD in the same year. The album's closing track, a cover of Bryan Adams' \"The Best Was Yet to Come,\" was produced and arranged by Branigan. The 1990–1991 Laura Branigan Tour, which was kicked off with an appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" on July 13, 1990 was followed by a performance in the Trump Regency Showroom in Atlantic City, N.J. on July 14, and filmed for a syndicated U.S. television show \"SRO in Concert\", which was released on videocassette and laserdisc; on July 15, 1990 she performed at the Warwick Musical Theatre in Rhode Island.\nOn Branigan's seventh and final studio album \"Over My Heart\" (August 17, 1993), the singer again produced (with Phil Ramone), and wrote and arranged. It included \"Didn't We Almost Win It All\" (by Branigan and Brian BecVar) (released as the first single), a cover of Cher's song \"Hard Enough Getting Over You\" (released as the second single), a cover of the Patty Loveless single \"How Can I Help You Say Goodbye\", a cover of Roxette's song \"The Sweet Hello, the Sad Goodbye\", and \"Is There Anybody Here But Me?\" (Pessis, Wells), a smooth mid-tempo number.\n\nAfter 1990 Branigan's chart success cooled in the U.S., though she was still in demand around the world and went on several global tours. In 1994, not long after the release of \"Over My Heart\", Larry Kruteck, Branigan's husband (m. 1978), was diagnosed with colon cancer. Branigan refused to accept the medical prognosis, and left the music industry to devote her attention to him. Branigan put Kruteck on herbal treatments, eventually nursing him full time. Krutech survived for another two and a half years and died on June 15, 1996 in New York.\n\nBranigan had official greatest hits collections released in South America, Japan, Germany, South Africa, and the U.S.; the U.S. collection was released in 1995. The 13-track \"The Best of Branigan\" included two newly-recorded covers: \"Show Me Heaven\" (written by Maria McKee) and the Donna Summer hit \"Dim All the Lights,\" which Branigan released in several remixes.\n\nOn August 15, 1995, Branigan was a guest on the TV show \"Talking Food\", hosted by Robin Leach and broadcast by the Food Network, and she promoted the album and sang the Donna Summer hit before preparing her Summer Delight pasta dish on the show.\n\nOn February 1996, she was selected to be part of the international jury at the XXXVII Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar, in Chile. Besides her duties as a jury member of this international musical competition, Branigan performed on Friday the 16th on the main stage for an audience who enthusiastically sang her greatest hits.\n\nIn early 2001 Branigan's return to the stage was postponed, when she broke both of her femurs in a 10-foot fall from a ladder while she was hanging wisteria outside her three-bedroom lakeside home in Westchester County, New York, resulting in physical therapy for six months. In 2002, she performed twice as the \"singing\" Janis Joplin in the off-Broadway musical \"Love, Janis\", before dropping out of the show. \"I left \"Janis\" because the producers failed to file with Equity properly,\" she told the \"Sunday News\" in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. \"I was sort of relieved. My voice isn't anything like Janis Joplin's, and there were 19 of her songs in the show.\" In later years she continued to record, and dated the drummer in her band Tommy Bayiokos. (People Magazine 9/13/04)\n\nAlso in 2002, her second official US hits collection, \"The Essentials\", was released, including the long out-of-print hit \"I Found Someone.\"\n\nBranigan died in her sleep at her lodge in East Quogue, New York, in 2004. The cause was attributed to a previously-undiagnosed ventricular brain aneurysm. It was reported in the media that she had been experiencing headaches for several weeks before her death, but did not seek medical attention.\n\nHer ashes were scattered over Long Island Sound.\n\nBranigan affectionately referred to her fans many times as her \"other half.\" On the first anniversary of her death in 2005, many fans attended the first \"Laura Branigan Spirit of Love Memorial Gathering\" weekend, sponsored by Other Half Entertainment and LauraBraniganOnline.com and held near the Long Island home where she last lived, caring for her mother. The gathering then became an annual tradition.\n\nOther Half Entertainment, Branigan's management company at the time of her death, continues to oversee her career legacy through her official website at www.LauraBraniganOnline.com, and her official MySpace and Facebook pages by taking part in various media opportunities, as well as through relationships with Warner Music Group and other entertainment industry entities, serving as the official voice for her legacy interests and keeping her artistic visions and standards at the heart of its operations.\n\nSince 2006, Branigan's management company worked regularly with Warner Music Group entities in the production and release of various new greatest hits compilations. \"The Platinum Collection\" is an 18-song compilation including all the major hits as well as tracks such as \"Silent Partners\", Satisfaction,\" \"All Night With Me,\" and \"If You Loved Me,\" which were four relatively new additions to Branigan hits compilations.\n\nIn 2007, the 1995 album \"The Best of Branigan\" was re-released, as part of Rhino's 2007 \"Greatest Hits\" series of CDs.

In addition, an increasing number of Lebanese students seeking education and career opportunities opted for the country in light of its relatively reputable institutions across the Middle East. Most of the Lebanese people in South Africa live mainly in the cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town.\n\nThe history of the Lebanese Community goes back to the late 19th century, when the first immigrants arrived in Johannesburg, the biggest city in the Transvaal coming from Sebhel, Mesyara, Becharre, Hadath El-Joube, Maghdoushe and other places. It is recorded that in the year 1896 the first Maronite and Lebanese immigrants arrived in Durban, Cape Town, and Mozambique, and congregated around their local Catholic Churches. The majority of the Lebanese immigrants were Maronite and being concerned about keeping their Maronite faith alive in a new country, they wrote to the Maronite Patriarch, insisting on the need for a Maronite priest to come to South Africa to continue their tradition and the Maronite Rite. In 1905, Patriarch Elias Peter Hoayek sent Father Emmanuel El-Fadle to South Africa from Kfarhata–Elzawye, North Lebanon. Father El-Fadle converted a building in Johannesburg into a church and residence. \n\nIn 1910, Father Ashkar arrived to build a church and a home for the priests. The Patriarch, then sent another priest to assist – Father Wakim Estphan. Fr. Ashkar returned to Lebanon and retired in 1928. The mission was then handed over to The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries. Father Yousef Juan, who was appointed as a temporary visitor, received instruction from the Patriarch and the General Superior for Father Yousef Moubarak to succeed him in serving the South African Maronite Community. The Congregation of Maronite Lebanese Missionaries have since served in South Africa among other countries and continue in their mission in serving and assisting in the Maronite Rite.\n\n\n"}

This nationhood can be symbolized by the date of independence, of becoming a republic or a significant date for a patron saint or a ruler (birthday, accession, removal, etc.). Often the day is not called \"National Day\" but serves and can be considered as one. The national day will often be a national holiday. Many countries have more than one national day.\n\nMost countries have a fixed-date national day, but some have movable dates. An example is Jamaica, which up to 1997 celebrated its national day on the first Monday in August. This commemorated independence from the United Kingdom which was attained on Monday, 6 August 1962, the first Monday in August of that year. Israel's Independence Day is not fixed relative to the civil Gregorian calendar, being formally linked to 5 Iyar on the Jewish calendar, but may also be moved to any day between 3 and 6 Iyar in order to avoid preparing for or celebrating either Independence Day or Memorial Day (which immediately precedes Independence Day) on Shabbat; the practical effect of this is that Independence Day may be celebrated any day between 15 April and 15 May. Another example is Thailand which celebrates the birthday of the king on 28 July. This date will change on the accession of the heir to the throne.\n\nMost national days can be categorized in two large blocks:\n\nDenmark and the United Kingdom are among the few countries that do not have designated national days (though Constitution Day has many of the same features of a national day in Denmark's case).\n\nImportance attached to the national day as well as the degree to which it is celebrated vary greatly from country to country. For example, Spain's national day Fiesta Nacional de España is held on 12 October, the day celebrated in other countries as Columbus Day or \"Día de la Raza\", and commemorates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas. A military parade is held in Madrid celebrating the occasion. The national day in France is 14 July and known as the \"Fête nationale\" (known in English-speaking countries as Bastille Day) commemorating the Storming of the Bastille, which is considered the start of the French Revolution. It is widely celebrated and the French Tricolour is much in evidence, while the President of the Republic attends a military parade on the Champs-Élysées of Paris. In the United States, the Independence Day celebrations on 4 July are widely celebrated with parades, fireworks, picnics and barbecues. In Ireland, Saint Patrick's Day, 17 March, is the equivalent of a national day and has been a public holiday for many years. However, in the United Kingdom the constituent countries' patron saints' days are low-key affairs. In recent times campaigns have commenced to promote the national days of England, Scotland and Wales, with St. Andrew's Day being designated as an official bank holiday when the Scottish Parliament passed the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007. A National Day for the United Kingdom has also been proposed in recent years.\n\nAs with the Bastille Day military parade in France, many other countries have a National Day Parade. Examples include the Singapore National Day Parade, and the parade for the National Day of the People's Republic of China.\n\nRegions that are not broadly recognized sovereign states are shown in . For regions controlled by sovereign states (such as federal states, autonomous regions, or colonies), the name of the sovereign state is shown in parentheses.\n\nDays that are not fixed to the Gregorian calendar are sorted by their 2017 occurrences.\n\n"}

{"id": "26463888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26463888", "title": "Paper wealth", "text": "Paper wealth\n\nPaper wealth means wealth as measured by monetary value, as reflected in the price of assets – how much money one's assets could be sold for. Paper wealth is contrasted with real wealth, which refers to one's actual physical assets.\n\nFor example, if one owns a house and its assessed value increases (relative to the general price level, i.e., assuming no inflation) then one's paper wealth has increased – the asset has increased in value, meaning it could in principle be sold in exchange for a larger quantity of money, but one's real wealth is unchanged – the real asset is still the same house. It is said that one has \"gotten richer \"on paper\",\" meaning \"as an accounting matter\": numbers on a balance sheet have changed, but the physical world has not.\n\nThe term \"paper wealth\" is frequently used in popular discussions of wealth, and in some critiques of capitalism, finance, and certain economic theories, but is little-used in mainstream economics, which instead generally identifies wealth with paper wealth. The term \"paper wealth\" has some pejorative connotations, suggesting \"only on paper (but not in reality)\", but can also be used neutrally to mean \"(simply) as an accounting matter\". Related distinctions are sometimes drawn between real assets and financial assets, or between tangible assets and intangible assets, the latter particularly in accounting, as detailed below.\n\nA confusing aspect of paper wealth is that it can increase or decrease across an entire economy, without any changes to the real economy; this is known as \"asset price inflation or deflation\" (a change in the aggregate (nominal) level of prices without corresponding real change). Thus, paper wealth does not \"come from\" or \"go to\" anywhere – the prices just go up or down. \"It's a common misunderstanding to ask, 'where did the money go'?\" which is particularly asked in the case of a stock market crash or in the bursting of a price bubble. This has more colorfully been described as \"A lot of money goes to money-heaven.\"\n\nTo illustrate, consider this example: Alice and Bob each own a house (suppose identical and neighboring). In a barter economy, Alice and Bob may decide to swap houses, and later to swap back – there is no notion of paper wealth here, just which house they each own and occupy. In a monetary economy, Alice may offer to sell Bob her house for one million dollars, and Bob may accept, and sell Alice his house for a same one million dollars – in this case they would each own a house, and each have paper wealth of one million dollars (the sale value of the house). If Alice decides to move back to her original house, and offers Bob her house for one dollar (rather than one million), and Bob accepts and sells Alice his house for one dollar, then they will move back to their original houses but now each have paper wealth of only one dollar.\n\nPaper wealth is fundamentally an accounting matter – one's net worth is the accounting value of one's assets minus the accounting value of one's liabilities. There are various accounting methods for different assets and liabilities, and they yield different notions of net worth; some methods are more or less volatile than others. For example, one may value (\"hold\", \"mark\") assets at book value, meaning the price for which they were purchased; in this case paper wealth does not change when the potential sale price of an asset changes, but does change if the asset is sold, as the asset is replaced by the sale proceeds. Conversely, one may mark assets at market value (mark to market accounting), in which case paper wealth changes as the market varies.\n\nIn some cases different measures may differ significantly – for example, one may purchase a stock for $1, and the market value may increase to $100, so the book value is $1 and the market value is $100. Conversely, one may purchase a house for $100,000, and then the housing market may fall, with the identical house next door selling for $80,000. In both these cases, book value and market value (to the extent that there is a market) differ, and which is more accurate may be debatable – one may argue that liquidation value (price obtained if sold immediately) would be a distressed sale and not reflect the potential value in a more orderly sale.\n\nIn economics, particularly political economy, the distinction between paper wealth and real wealth is part of a larger debate on different notions of value; paper wealth corresponds to exchange value (value that can be realized in exchanging a good for something else) and real wealth corresponds to use value (value that can be realized in using a good oneself). This is a traditional distinction, dating from Aristotle in antiquity to David Ricardo in the classical economics of the 19th century, but the distinction is no longer drawn in mainstream economics, particularly neoclassical economics, and the debate resolved in favor of exchange value – market price is seen as a sufficient notion of value; see Exchange value: Other theories of exchange value for discussion.\n\nIn economics, the notion of paper wealth is most associated with the heterodox school of Marxian economics, in the notion of fictitious capital by Karl Marx, in his critique of capitalism.\n\nPaper wealth is also important in certain theories of economic crises, notably those that believe these to be caused by price bubbles, as described below.\n\nPaper wealth is attributed as being a factor in economic cycles; in mainstream economics this is interpreted as the wealth effect, while in some heterodox schools it is interpreted as price bubbles.\n\nThe most commonly discussed effect of paper wealth is the wealth effect: as people (households) increase in wealth, they are likely to spend more, while if their wealth decreases, they are likely to spend less. This is termed \"the wealth effect\" (compare income effect), and is generally attributed to psychological feelings of confidence – one feels rich, so one spends. The significance of the wealth effect is debated; it is generally procyclical, meaning that when the economy is doing well, asset prices increase, causing consumers to spend more, which provides further stimulus to the economy and risks causing overheating. Conversely, if the economy is doing poorly, asset prices fall and consumers spend less, leading to a vicious cycle and potentially a depression.\n\nLess commonly, increases in overall paper wealth are seen as signs of price bubbles – unsustainable increases in the level of prices. These are generally attributed to credit bubbles (prices are bid up using borrowed money), and seen as a significant warning sign of a pending economic crisis; they form the central mechanism of Austrian business cycle theory and debt deflation.\n\nThese concerns are not widely shared by mainstream economics – elevated asset price levels are considered a concern, but a minor one, while private credit levels are not considered macroeconomically significant, as they are simply a question of distribution.\n\nAustrian economics ascribes price bubbles as due to excess printing of money by central banks, and ultimately inflationary; the resulting bursting of the price bubble and following depression being necessary purging of the previous excesses.\n\nIn debt deflation (most associated with Post-Keynesian economics, but with some mainstream interest), price bubbles are particularly associated with excess \"private\" credit growth, especially extension of credit by commercial banks. While the price bubble itself is neutral, people then borrow against these inflated asset prices (as via a home equity line of credit), which increases the credit bubble, and it is the elevated level of \"debt\" that is the underlying cause of the ensuing depression.\n\nAssets can be distinguished as real (physical) assets, notably property, plant, and equipment (PP&E – real estate, buildings, durable equipment) and inventory (consumables), and financial assets (equity and debt in other companies).\n\nAt the level of a household, real assets are most commonly a home (both the land and the building), personal belongings (notably cars or other vehicles), and some commodities (such as gold) or collectibles (art). Financial assets most commonly include stocks and bonds (both corporate and government). The status of cash is more debatable – fiat money is formally a financial asset backed by a government, while a bank deposit is a financial asset backed by a commercial bank, which today is generally backed by a government (via deposit insurance such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). As such, the value of cash may inflate away – it is a form of paper wealth – but it is generally distinguished from stocks and bonds.\n\nA related technical issue in economics is the aggregation problem, as debated in the Cambridge capital controversy – to what extent is it permissible and useful to aggregate different measures? Aggregating different physical and financial assets is, in some views, illegitimate or misleading, though the \"market value\" of assets can simply be aggregated by adding. This aggregation is generally accepted practice in economic theory, with disaggregation reserved for accounting or detailed analysis.\n\nIn accounting, tangible assets and intangible assets are distinguished. In wealth management, liquid financial assets (roughly corresponding to common understanding of paper wealth, ignoring value of housing) is a key metric.\n\nBeyond real assets and financial assets, other valuable intangible assets, which are popularly referred to as \"wealth\", are formally referred to as forms of \"capital\". At the individual level these are referred to as human capital, including education and social connections, while at the social level these are referred to as social capital, and include communities, social norms, and institutions; more traditionally these were referred to as \"civilization\", but this usage is now considered pejorative.\n\n"}

{"id": "8304759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8304759", "title": "Printing registration", "text": "Printing registration\n\nIn color printing, registration is the method of correlating overlapping colors on one single image. There are many different styles and types of registration, many of which employ the alignment of specific marks.\n\nWhen printing an image or a package of some sort that has more than one color, it is necessary to print each color separately and ensure each color overlaps the others precisely. If this is not done, the finished image will look fuzzy, blurred or \"out of register\" (see image to right). To help line the colors up correctly, a system of registration is necessary.\n\nA remedy for slight misregistration is trapping. Where two colours abut, the lighter colour is slightly expanded into the darker to create an overlap. This yields a darker outline, which is considered less objectionable than a white gap. A major exception to this is the case when opaque (colors that completely obscure colors printed beneath them) spot colors are used. Other colors, regardless of their relative luminance, are always trapped to (spread under) these spot colors. If several of these spot colors are used (a common practice in the packaging market), the order of printing layers rather than luminance is the decisive element: the first color to be printed is spread under the next color. The trap width is dictated by the maximum amount of misregistration of the entire workflow up to the press.\n\nBlack ink is set to \"overprint\" colors in the background. The difference is not visible since the lighter color is spread underneath the—almost—opaque black.\n\nThere are many different styles of registration for many different types of printing. These deal with stone lithography, as used in fine arts printmaking.\n\nThis method, using small measured registration marks on both the stone and the paper, is very accurate and simple to do. The printer measures the exact size of the paper and the desired margins. Then marks are made at both ends of the sheet of paper, and corresponding marks (usually in the shape of a \"T\") are made on the stone. Then the printer matches the marks on the paper to those on the stone. This way many runs of different colors can be pulled exactly in line with one another, each of them measured from the same system of marks.\n\nThis method involves laying the paper on the un-inked surface, and making a pin-hole through both the bottom and top of the paper, being careful to make a mark in the stone's surface. Then the locations of the holes are transferred to each sheet of paper to be printed. When printing, one should place pins in each hole of a sheet of paper, and lower it onto the inked stone, placing each pin in its respective hole in the stone. This method can ruin paper by creating holes. And if the holes get too large, they lose their function as registration devices.\n\nThis method relies solely on hand–eye coordination. The printer places the paper over the stone-image, measuring and judging registration by eye. This is not very consistent, depending on the person. \n"}

Prostitution increased further at the end of the civil war in 2001. Prohibition is not consistently enforced. Many women engage in prostitution due to poverty. It was estimated in 2013 that there were about 33,00 sex workers in the country. Many Namibian women enter the country illegally, often via the border municipality of Curoca, and travel to towns such as Ondjiva, Lubango and Luanda to work as prostitutes.\n\nProstitution thrives in the oil-rich Cabinda Province, where many American and other foreign nationals work. Women from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo cross the porous border to earn money in the enclave as prostitutes. Some of the police in the area are corrupt and deport the women if they do not pay the bribes required. The most famous bar/brothel in the enclave is \"Berlita\" in Cabinda city's Comandante Jika neighbourhood. It is named after its late owner, a sex worker. Prostitution is also common in the diamond mining areas.\n\nThe Ministry of Family and Women Promotion (MINFAMU) maintains a women's shelter in the capital, Luanda, that is open to former prostitutes.\n\nHuman trafficking from China is a major problem, on which the Angolan government is working with the Chinese Police. Child prostitution is also a problem in the country.\n\nAngola hosted the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. There were fears that the increased demand for prostitutes from the visiting fans would lead to a surge in human trafficking. An Anti-Trafficking Law was passed, and a soccer based public awareness campaign was run.\n\nThe spread of STIs and HIV were a concern. The organising committee, LOC, initially tried to get all the prostitutes removed from the cites hosting games, but this wasn't practical. In conjunction with the Health Commission in Angola, they distributed 5 million free condoms to bars, hotels and other strategic locations.\n\nAngola has a large HIV/AIDS infected population. However, it has one of the lowest prevalence rates in the Southern Africa zone. Sex workers are a high risk group. UNAIDS reported that there was a 4.7% prevalence amongst sex workers in 2016. (The figure amongst the general adult population was 1.9%)\n\nThe reluctance to use condoms is a contributing factor. In 2016, UNAIDS reported 82.6% condom usage amongst sex workers. Some sex workers charge double for sex without a condom. Another factor is that the many prostitutes that are in the country illegally have no access to health services.\n\nAngola is a source and destination country for women, and children subjected to sex trafficking. Angolan girls as young as 13 years old are victims of sex trafficking. The provinces of Luanda, Benguela, and the border provinces of Cunene, Namibe, Zaire, and Uige are the most vulnerable to trafficking activities. Angolan women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in South Africa, Namibia, and European countries, including the Netherlands and Portugal.\n\nWomen from Vietnam and Brazil engaged in prostitution in Angola may be victims of sex trafficking. Some Chinese women are recruited by Chinese gangs and construction companies with promises of work, but later are deprived of their passports, kept in walled compounds with armed guards, and forced into prostitution to pay back the costs of their travel. Undocumented Congolese migrants, including children, enter Angola for work in diamond-mining districts, where some endure sex trafficking in mining camps. Trafficking networks recruit and transport Congolese girls as young as 12 years old from Kasai Occidental in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Angola for sex trafficking.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Angola as a \"Tier 2 Watch List\" country.\n"}

As well as women turning to prostitution voluntarily, some were trafficked from Moldova, Bulgaria and the Ukraine.\n\nAmnesty International UK Director Kate Allen is quoted as saying \"Women and girls as young as 11 are being sold into sexual slavery in Kosovo and international peacekeepers are not only failing to stop it they are actively fuelling this despicable trade by themselves paying for sex from trafficked women.\"\n\nHead of the Mitrovica based International Press Centre, Rade Negojevic, claimed Kosovo had become the world's biggest brothel since the arrival of the international peacekeepers.\n\nIn 2000, the UNMIK administration set up a Trafficking and Prostitution Police Unit with the intention combating pimps, traffickers and organised crime. Measures against trafficking were included in the Interim Penal Code of Kosovo when it was drafted.\n\nThe State Police Service reported in 2008 that prostitution was occurring in 694 bars, cafeteria and night clubs in Kosovo.\n\nKosovo is a source and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Most victims are internally trafficked for sexual exploitation. Traffickers recruit victims through false promises of marriage or employment offers in cafes, night-clubs, and restaurants. Most sex trafficking victims in Kosovo are girls, although Kosovo criminal groups also force women from Albania, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, and other European countries into prostitution. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in private homes and apartments, night-clubs, and massage parlors. Children used as dancers and escorts are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Traffickers subject Kosovo citizens to forced prostitution throughout Europe. Economically marginalized Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptians communities are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Government corruption creates an environment that enables some trafficking crimes. Several police officers, labor ministry employees, and other government officials have been charged with or convicted of trafficking crimes.\n\nArticle 171 of the criminal code prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of five to 12 years imprisonment and a fine of up to €500,000.

{"id": "899386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=899386", "title": "Prosumer", "text": "Prosumer\n\nA prosumer is a person who consumes and produces a product. It is derived from \"prosumption\", a dot-com era business term meaning \"production by consumers\". These terms were coined in 1980 by American futurist Alvin Toffler, and were widely used by many technology writers of the time. Today it generally refers to a person using commons-based peer production.\n\n\"Prosumer\" is also a trade term, used from a business perspective, for high-end electronic devices (such as digital cameras), meaning a price point between \"professional\" and \"consumer\" devices.\n\nThis blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative self-help movements that sprang up during various economic crises e.g. the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n\n\nMarshall McLuhan and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their 1972 book \"Take Today\", (p. 4) that with electric technology, the consumer would become a producer. In the 1980 book, \"The Third Wave\", futurologist Alvin Toffler coined the term \"prosumer\" when he predicted that the role of producers and consumers would begin to blur and merge (even though he described it in his book \"Future Shock\" from 1970). Toffler envisioned a highly saturated marketplace as mass production of standardized products began to satisfy basic consumer demands. To continue growing profit, businesses would initiate a process of mass customization, that is the mass production of highly customized products.\n\nHowever, to reach a high degree of customization, consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying design requirements. In a sense, this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like architects for many decades. However, in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers, a distinction touched upon in the H+ Magazine essay 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative'.\n\nToffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century. Along with more recently published works such as \"Revolutionary Wealth\" (2006), we can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the \"prosumer\" as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale. That these concepts are having global impact and reach, however, can be measured in part by noting in particular, Toffler's popularity in China. Discussing some of these issues with Newt Gingrich on C-SPAN's \"After Words\" program in June 2006, Toffler mentioned that \"The Third Wave\" is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China, just behind a work by Mao Zedong.\n\nDon Tapscott reintroduced the concept in his 1995 book \"The Digital Economy.\"\n\nDespite several decades of usage, the term only recently began to receive full theoretical elaboration. George Ritzer and Nathan Jurgenson, in a widely cited article, claim that prosumption has become a salient characteristic of Web 2.0. Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages.\n\nMass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy. Mass customization has ruled the food & beverage industry for years. Look at how many choices we are faced with in the grocery stores and supermarkets. Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names, giving us thousands of choices. Most consumption continues to be passive as critics of television, recorded music, and fast food would argue. Indeed, people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture. In \"The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less\", Barry Schwartz argues that diminishing returns from a confusing abundance of consumer choice is producing stress and dissatisfaction. Still, one key area of high-customization \"is\" taking place: highly involved hobbyists.\n\nIn the digital and online world, Prosumer is used to describe today's online buyers because not only are they consumers of products, but they are able to produce their own products such as, customised handbags, jewellery with initials, jumpers with team logos etc.\n\nIn the field of renewable energy, prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national (or local) distribution network; whilst at other times (when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it) they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid. This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity. Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity, referred to as prosumage in the literature. It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places. The European Union’s Nobel Grid project, which is part of their Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, uses the term in this way for example.\n\nWith customization focused on leisure pursuits, Toffler's initial combination has been largely supplanted by a second pair of blurring roles: that of the professional and consumer. In particular, hobbyists have become ever-more demanding in the pursuits of their hobbies, often rising above the level of dilettante (an amateur, someone who dabbles in a field out of casual interest rather than as a profession or serious interest) to the point of commanding skills equal to that of professionals. Key examples of such hobbies are:\n\nThis \"professional\" slant of the prosumer term is most common in photography which is a field that highlights prosumer trends. Access to professional-level equipment and skills is made possible by combination of factors such as:\nToffler’s Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler, he saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers. Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume, furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it. He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities, and to more sustainable lifestyles, that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in 2013 and 2015 in two marketing books.\n\nYet a third meaning or usage of prosumer is springing up, especially among some activist groups. That is, the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to \"exclude\" (or at least diminish) the role of the corporate producer; thus, rather than generating higher corporate profits from value-added products, producers would, at best, be reduced to supplying lower-profit commodity inputs. Indeed, the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as globalization, automation, and wealth concentration.\n\nA fourth view of the Prosumer is from the companies' perspective; that is, companies that open up their processes to the end-user, integrating them as prosumers for shared benefits. Such motivated enthusiasts can be, for instance, brought into a company's R&D. Other benefits might include strengthened customer relations and faster feedback cycles.\nCompanies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the end-users to develop final products and services. In some instances, end-users are creating products on their own, without the interference from (or assistance of) third parties (i.e. companies, organizations, etc.). For example, Lego Mindstorms allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish.\n\nIn their 2006 book \"Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything\", Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams use the related term of prosumption (production/consumption; also coined by Toffler) to refer to the creation of products and services by the same people who will ultimately use them.\n\nIdentifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include:\n\nA fourth view of the \"prosumer\" is as one who is aware:\nFor example, a manufacturer of widgets has a customer who changes their requirements, asking that all their widgets sing. This customer is important enough that losing them would seriously hurt the company's bottom line. Based on this customer's request, the company direct a portion of its R&D budget to address this requirement. While the customer didn’t make the changes directly, they did influence the company's design requirements. This arrangement has positive effects for both parties;\n\nfor the customer\nfor the company\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29298", "title": "Spouse", "text": "Spouse\n\nA spouse is a life partner in a marriage, civil union, or common-law marriage. The term is gender neutral, whereas a male spouse is a husband and a female spouse is a wife. Although a spouse is a form of significant other, the latter term also includes non-marital partners who play a social role similar to that of a spouse, but do not have rights and duties reserved by law to a spouse.\n\nThe legal status of a spouse, and the specific rights and obligations associated with that status, vary significantly among the jurisdictions of the world. These regulations are usually described in family law statutes. However, in many parts of the world, where civil marriage is not that prevalent, there is instead customary marriage, which is usually regulated informally by the community. In many parts of the world, spousal rights and obligations are related to the payment of bride price, dowry or dower. Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to male marital partners that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to female marital partners. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender. Among the last European countries to establish full gender equality in marriage were Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France in the 1980s. In various marriage laws around the world, however, the husband continues to have authority; for instance the Civil Code of Iran states at Article 1105: \"In relations between husband and wife; the position of the head of the family is the exclusive right of the husband\".\n\nDepending on jurisdiction, the refusal or inability of a spouse to perform the marital obligations may constitute a ground for divorce, legal separation or annulment. The latter two options are more prevalent in countries where the dominant religion is Roman Catholicism, some of which introduced divorce only recently (i.e. Italy in 1970, Portugal in 1975, Brazil in 1977, Spain in 1981, Argentina in 1987, Paraguay in 1991, Colombia in 1991, Ireland in 1996, Chile in 2004 and Malta in 2011). In recent years, many Western countries have adopted no fault divorce. In some parts of the world, the formal dissolution of a marriage is complicated by the payments and goods which have been exchanged between families (this is common where marriages are arranged). This often makes it difficult to leave a marriage, especially for the woman: in some parts of Africa, once the bride price has been paid, the wife is seen as belonging to the husband and his family; and if she wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the girl's family. The girl's family often cannot or does not want to pay it back.\n\nRegardless of legislation, personal relations between spouses may also be influenced by local culture and religion, which may promote male authority over the wife: for instance the word (ba`al), Hebrew for \"husband\", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with \"owner\" and \"master\".\n\nThere is often a minimum legal marriageable age. The United Nations Population Fund stated the following:\n\nAlthough in Western countries spouses sometimes choose not to have children, such a choice is not accepted in some parts of the world. In some cultures and religions, the quality of a spouse imposes an obligation to have children. In northern Ghana, for example, the payment of bride price signifies a woman's requirement to bear children, and women using birth control are at risks of threats and coercion.\n\nThere are many ways in which a spouse is chosen, which vary across the world, and include love marriage, arranged marriage, and forced marriage. The latter is in some jurisdictions a void marriage or a voidable marriage. Forcing someone to marry is also a criminal offense in some countries.\n\n"}

Sutermeister. It is considered “one of the most detailed documentations about miscarriages of justice in the German language”. It is inspired by Voltaire′s early activism against French miscarriages of justice of puritan origin, as well as by Arthur Conan Doyle′s criminalistic approaches.\n\nThe book proposes a legal reform for Switzerland which has never been realized because of political controversies. The Maria Popescu, Pierre Jaccoud, and Vera Brühne cases are discussed in detail, as Sutermeister was involved in the criminal researches. The George Edalji case serves, among others, to illustrate the issue of faulty expertises. The main part consists of the so–called “Hirschberg test”, based on Max Hirschbergs categories of causes of judicial errors.\n\nThe “Hirschberg test” begins with critique against the preliminary inquiries concerning Josef Issels and Bruno Gröning.\n\nThe phenomenon of mis-identification are illustrated by the Joseph Lesurques, Billy Armstrong, Adolph Beck, Leopold Hilsner, Menahem Mendel Beilis, Sacco and Vanzetti, Joe Hill, Caryl Chessman, Charles Townsend, James Hanratty, John Dickman, Rubin Carter, Jerome Frank, Will Purvis, Anna Anderson cases, a large list of experiences which led to wrongful court decisions and which serve to illustrate also other items of the “Hirschberg test”.\n\nThe issue of uncritical assessment of guilty plea is illustrated by the cases of Timothy Evans, Harold Israel, Marinus van der Lubbe, Albert DeSalvo, Jack the Ripper, Mata Hari, Renate von Natzmer, Danny Escobedo, Richard Speck, and Alfred George Hinds, among others.\n\nIn the chapter about the impact of fellow convicts on dispensation of justice is considered the judgment of Barbara Graham; and concerning the witness account, the Felix Fechenbach case, the Guillaume Affair, and the cases of Antoine Argoud, Beate Klarsfeld, Milan Bogunovic, Baader-Meinhof, Raoul Villain, Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley, and Maximilian Kolbe. In the cases of Marguerite Steinheil, Leo Frank, Samuel Sheppard, Karl Stauffer, and Ronald Light, the lies of the accused would have offered guilty proof.\n\nCircumstantial evidence lawsuits are illustrated by the cases of Frederick Seddon, Marie Besnard, Steven Truscott, Graham Frederick Young, and some white-collar crimes. Suggestibility and emotional biases of the jury as causes of wrongful court decisions are shoewd by the cases of Jesse Hill Ford, Joan Little, and Alger Hiss.\n\nThe relationship between miscarriages of justice and public morality are analysed through the cases of Henriette Caillaux, Ruth Ellis, Sir Ewan Forbes, 11th Baronet, Arthur Gray, Horst Schumann, Joan Berry, Baader-Meinhof, Timothy Leary, Patricia Hearst, Kurt Gerstein, Paul Grüninger, Rudolf Roessler, David Frankfurter, Pyotr Grigorenko, Vladimir Bukovsky, Derek Bentley, Edith Thompson, Ivar Kreuger, Stavisky Affair, Harald Feller, Carl Lutz, Viola Liuzzo, Wilma Montesi, Horst Wessel, among many others.\n\nThe case of Jacques Isorni serves to illustrate certain relationship between law and ethics.\n\nThe author concludes by briefly analysing other aspects of misleading or other judgments revising the John Thomas Scopes, Carl von Ossietzky, Theodor Lessing, Bruno Lüdke, Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany, Hans Paasche, Ludwig Quidde, and Weiße Rose cases.\n\nThe book has the appearance of a patchwork obtained by stitching together legal and controversial political parts, as has been criticized by German jurist Klaus Volk and the Austrian Nazi medical writer Otto Scrinzi. For the German criminal law expert Karl Peters, on the other hand, the book represents a milestone in the series of works about miscarriages of justice which comes to terms with many failures of post-World War II criminal judgments in Germany and Switzerland, therefore completing a certain continuing effort which has its history in the works of Erich Sello, Max Alsberg, Albert Hellwig, Max Hirschberg, and Heinrich Jagusch.\n\n"}
{"id": "5385711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5385711", "title": "Tommy Wiseau", "text": "Tommy Wiseau\n\nThomas Wiseau (, ) is a European-American actor, director, screenwriter and filmmaker. He wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the 2003 film \"The Room\", which has been described by many critics as one of the worst movies ever made and has gained cult film status. He also directed the 2004 documentary \"Homeless in America\" and created the 2015 sitcom \"The Neighbors\".\n\nMany details about Wiseau's personal life (including his age and background) remain unverified, and as such have been the subject of intense fan speculation and various conflicting reports. The 2013 non-fiction book \"The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made\" by Greg Sestero, as well as its 2017 film adaptation, chronicle the making of \"The Room\" and Wiseau's life behind the scenes.\n\nWiseau is very secretive about his early life. In various interviews, he has claimed to have lived in France \"a long time ago\"; claimed he grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana; and described having \"an entire family\" in Chalmette, Louisiana. In interviews following the release of \"The Room\" in 2003, Wiseau gave an age which would indicate he was born in 1968 or 1969, but friend Greg Sestero claims in his 2013 memoir \"The Disaster Artist\" that his brother's girlfriend obtained copies of Wiseau's U.S. immigration papers and found that Wiseau was born \"much earlier\" than he claimed, in an Eastern Bloc country in the mid to late 1950s.\n\nIn his 2016 documentary, \"Room Full of Spoons\", Rick Harper claims to have researched Wiseau's background and concluded that he is Polish and originally from the city of Poznań. Wiseau confirmed publicly for the first time in November 2017 that he is originally from Europe: \"Long story short, I grew up in Europe a long time ago, but I'm American and very proud of it.\" In a December 2017 interview with Howard Stern, he claimed to speak fluent French and said he is a Catholic.\n\nIn \"The Disaster Artist\", Sestero asserts that Wiseau revealed to him—through \"fantastical, sad, self-contradictory stories\"—that as a young adult he moved to Strasbourg, where he adopted the name \"Pierre\" and worked as a restaurant dishwasher. According to Sestero, Wiseau described being wrongfully arrested following a drug raid at a hostel and being traumatised by his mistreatment by the French police, which led him to emigrate to the U.S. to purportedly live with an aunt and uncle in Chalmette.\n\nSestero asserts that after Wiseau had lived in Louisiana for some amount of time, he subsequently moved to San Francisco, California, where he worked as a street vendor selling toys to tourists near Fisherman's Wharf. Wiseau supposedly gained the nickname \"The Birdman\" for his bird toys, which were only popular in Europe at the time; this led him to legally change his name when he became a U.S. citizen to Thomas Pierre Wiseau, taking the French word for \"bird\" (\"oiseau\") and replacing the O with the W of his birth name.\n\nAround this time, Wiseau also claims to have obtained a degree in psychology from Laney Community College in Oakland, asserting that he had graduated on the honor roll.\n\nAccording to Sestero, Wiseau worked a variety of jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area, including restaurant busboy and hospital worker, and ran a business called Street Fashions USA that sold irregular blue jeans at discounted prices. He eventually purchased and rented out large retail spaces in and around San Francisco and Los Angeles, making him independently wealthy. In the same book, however, Sestero admits that the idea of Wiseau becoming wealthy so quickly via the jobs he claims to have had is so unlikely that he himself finds it impossible to believe. Sestero suggests on several occasions that many people involved with the creation of \"The Room\" believed the film to be part of some money-laundering scheme for organized crime, but Sestero himself considers this unlikely.\n\nWiseau claims to have been involved in a near-fatal car crash in California after another driver ran a red light and struck Wiseau's vehicle; as a result, Wiseau was hospitalized for several weeks. Sestero suggests that this incident was the turning point in Wiseau's life that led him to pursue his dreams of becoming an actor and director, ambitions that he had long neglected while pursuing financial security.\n\nWiseau has stated that he has been influenced by the films \"The Guns of Navarone\" and \"Citizen Kane\", and specifically the actors James Dean and Marlon Brando. According to Sestero, Wiseau's obsession with James Dean was so intense that he often visited a Los Angeles restaurant owned by a former acquaintance of Dean, and that several lines of dialogue in \"The Room\" (including the infamous cry \"You are tearing me apart, Lisa!\") were based on lines from \"Rebel Without a Cause\". Wiseau also cites his cinematic influences as including Tennessee Williams, Orson Welles, Elizabeth Taylor, and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nSestero notes that the actor had been \"trying to bust in\" to Hollywood since the late 1980s, and recounts being shown an undated VHS tape of Wiseau in Vincent Chase's acting class (with whom Wiseau had a contentious relationship). He was apparently enrolled in Chase's program around 1994. Wiseau also allegedly attended film classes at Los Angeles Community College.\n\nDuring this time, Wiseau directed a student film, \"Robbery Doesn't Pay\", shot with a super 8 camera in the Westwood section of Los Angeles. The film, which does not star Wiseau, has been described by Sestero as \"just a dude walking around looking at cars to 'Blue Monday' by Orgy.\"\n\nWiseau's film \"The Room\" was released in 2003. Its budget was $6 million, the financing of which has remained a source of intrigue. The film was based on an unpublished 540-page novel written by Wiseau himself. The movie was immediately lambasted by critics, but ultimately became a \"cult classic\" with late-night showings at theaters around the world.\n\nAudience members typically arrive wearing wigs resembling their favorite characters, interact with the dialogue on screen, and throw plastic cutlery and footballs around the theater in reference to on-screen events. This attention grew into what was dubbed \"The Room\"s 2010–2011 \"Love is Blind\" International Tour, with the movie being screened in the United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Australia and India, among other locations. Wiseau appears at many of these events, posing for photographs with fans and often addressing the audience before screenings.\n\nIn the 2017 film adaptation of Greg Sestero's autobiography \"The Disaster Artist\", James Franco portrays Wiseau, for which he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. Wiseau approved of the choice, as well as that of Dave Franco as Sestero. Tommy Wiseau makes a cameo appearance in a post-credits scene as Henry.\n\nIn 2004, Wiseau produced and appeared in a short documentary, \"Homeless in America\". In 2010 he starred in a 15-minute parody horror film entitled \"The House That Drips Blood on Alex\".\n\nIn March 2015, Wiseau stated in a Reddit \"ask me anything\" thread that he had commenced work on a new project named \"The Foreclosure\".\n\nHe was featured as the villain Linton Kitano in \"\", the sequel to the cult classic \"Samurai Cop\". In October 2016, it was announced that Wiseau and Sestero would star in a movie called \"Best F(r)iends\". The movie was written by Sestero and was shot in secret in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2008, Wiseau produced and appeared in the pilot episode of a television series called \"The Neighbors\". A trailer for \"The Neighbors\" showed a series of clips set in an office. The show's website, accompanied by trailers and announcements at \"The Room\" showings in 2015, stated that the show is coming to various media distribution outlets in March 2015.\n\nIn 2009, Wiseau guest-starred in an episode of \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\" titled \"Tommy\", wherein Wiseau guest-directed a segment titled \"Pigman\". After Wiseau expressed a desire to work with the duo again, Tim and Eric announced in 2009 that they were developing two series for him.\n\nIn 2010, Wiseau appeared in Marc Wootton's 2010 comedy TV series \"La La Land\". In a mockumentary format, Wootton's character, Gary Garner, accepted a role in Wiseau's present production at the time. Wiseau kicked Wootton off the set after Wootton jokingly alluded to using production funds to buy instant lotto tickets.\n\nIn 2011, Wiseau starred in a YouTube web series, \"Tommy Explains it All\", in which he explained his views on various topics ranging from \"Citizen Kane\" to the art of kissing.\n\nWiseau starred in segments on Machinima.com called \"The Tommy Wi-Show\". The segments show Wiseau playing various video games, such as \"Mortal Kombat\" and \"\", and offering commentary.\n\nWiseau remains private about the details of his personal and family life. In 2017, he told \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"I think private life should be private life, the professional life should be the professional life, and that's where I stand, and I have right to do that.\" During a 2016 interview with James Franco, Wiseau referred to Greg Sestero as his \"best friend\".\n\n"}

{"id": "23190422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23190422", "title": "Waṣf", "text": "Waṣf\n\nWaṣf () (literally 'attribute' or 'description'; pl. \"awṣāf\" أوصاف) is an ancient style of Arabic poetry, which can be characterised as descriptive verse. The concept of \"waṣf\" was also borrowed into Persian, which developed its own rich poetic tradition in this mode.\n\n\"Waṣf\" was one of four kinds of poetry in which medieval Arabic poets were expected to be competent, alongside 'the boast (\"fakhr\"), the invective (\"hijaa’\"), and the elegy (\"marthiya\")'.\n\nProbably deriving from the descriptions of the abandoned campsite and beloved in the ancient qasida's erotic prelude, and of animals and landscape in the journey section, or \"rahiil\", it evolved into a genre of its own in Abbasid Baghdad and later in Spain. The tradition in Arabic was highly developed, with poets often devoting entire collections to elaborate treatments of single subjects, such as hunting animals, kinds of flowers, and specific objects. [...] While one might initially be inclined to take the genre of \"wasf\" poetry lightly--since it involves \"mere\" description, in fact an argument could be made for seeing this genre as, in some instances, central to the poetry of the period.\n\nIn \"waṣf\" love poems, each part of a lover's body is described and praised in turn, often using exotic, extravagant, or even far-fetched metaphors. The Song of Solomon is a prominent example of such a poem, and other examples can be found in Thousand and One Nights. The images given in this type of poetry are not literally descriptive. Instead, they convey the delight of the lover for the beloved, where the lover finds freshness and splendor in the body as a reflected image in the world. Other varieties of \"waṣf\" include literary riddles.\n\nThis genre had a long history and later became a favorite of the troubadour poets and the authors of sonnets in the Elizabethan era. This renaissance literature was popularized by French authors via Italian and was called the \"blasons anatomiques\" or blazon (see Italian poet Petrarch). Shakespeare effectively ended this movement with his Sonnet 130 which satirized the form. For instance, the first line in that satire reads, \"My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun.\"\n\n"}

A fast decrease of the TFR occurred after independence. In 1998 the lowest rate was recorded: 1.28 children born per women. In 2001, the United Nations reported through its annual world-population report that \"Estonia was one of the fastest-shrinking nations on earth, at risk of losing nearly half its 1.4 million people by mid-century\". To prevent this drop in TFR, one of the steps the Estonian government took since 2004 was to start \"paying\" women by providing them with subsidies \"to have babies\" known as \"mother's salary\"). After giving birth and during maternity leave, working Estonian women received full monthly income for up to 15 months (equivalent to US$1,560.00); non-working women who gave birth received a monthly subsidy equivalent to US$200.00. The TFR slightly recovered in the subsequent years, but fluctuated by year, and continued to remain below the replacement rate (being 1.54 children/woman in 2014). As in many other European countries, the link between marriage and fertility has been weakened during the past decades: most children today are born outside of marriage (59% of children were born to unmarried women in 2014). The average age of mothers at first birth in 2014 was 26.6 years.\n\nIn the past, according to Estonian mythology, the ancient women of Estonia believed in the female deity and protector of pregnant women in labor known as Rõugutaja.\n\nFirst woman cleric Laine Villenthal was ordinated in 1967 by Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. \n\n"}
{"id": "33199453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33199453", "title": "Wukan protests", "text": "Wukan protests\n\nThe Wukan protests, also known as the Siege of Wukan, was an anti-corruption protest that began in September 2011, and escalated in December 2011 with the expulsion of officials by villagers, the siege of the town by police, and subsequent détente in the southern Chinese village of Wukan (pop. 12,000). The villagers rose up again in June 2016, but were again suppressed. The most recent rounds of clashes were in September, 2016, when the former village leader Lin Zulian was sentenced to jail. The clashes were suppressed.\n\nThe protests began on 21–23 September 2011 after officials sold land to real estate developers without properly compensating the villagers. Several hundred to several thousand people protested in front of and then attacked a government building, a police station and an industrial park. Protesters held signs saying \"give us back our farmland\" and \"let us continue farming.\" Rumors that the police had killed a child further inflamed the protesters and provoked rioting. Residents of Wukan had previously petitioned the national government in 2009 and 2010 over the land disputes. In an apparent attempt to ease tensions, authorities allowed villagers to select 13 representatives to engage in negotiations.\n\nSecurity agents abducted five of the representatives and took them into custody in early December. The protests strengthened after one of the village representatives, Xue Jinbo, died in police custody in suspicious circumstances. The villagers forced the entire local government, Communist Party leadership and police out of the village. , a thousand police laid siege to the village, preventing food and goods from entering the village. Government authorities set up internet censorship against information about Wukan, Lufeng and Shanwei.\n\nWukan is a village that had often been described as being especially harmonious. International newspapers described the December uprising as being exceptional compared to other \"mass incidents\" in the People's Republic of China which numbered approximately 180,000 in 2010.\n\nThe village representatives and provincial officials reached a peaceful agreement, satisfying the villagers' immediate requests. Local Communist Party secretary of Shanwei City said that the authority of the city has been \"overridden\" by provincial intervention.\n\nWukan village (population 20,000) is located in Lufeng county-level city of Guangdong province, some 5 km south () of Lufeng's central urban area. The village is near the shore of the Wukan Harbor (乌坎港), which is part of the Jieshi Bay (碣石湾) of the South China Sea; the location of the village near the southern Chinese coast lends itself well to urban development. The village has enjoyed the reputation on the mainland for many years as a model village for its harmoniousness, civility and prosperity.\n\nSince the abolition of agricultural taxes in 2006, local government has been increasingly raising money through land sales to the extent that this is now a primary revenue stream. Conflicts between farmers and local officials have risen throughout China, often because of land seizures (or \"land grabs\"). The rate of forced evictions has grown significantly since the 1990s, as city and county-level governments have increasingly come to rely on land sales as a source of revenue. In 2011, the Financial Times reported that 40 percent of local government revenue comes from land sales. Guan Qingyou, a professor at Tsinghua University, estimated that land sales accounted for 74 percent of local government income in 2010. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, by the end of 2011 there was a total of 50 million displaced farmers across China (from all preceding years), and an average of 3 million farmers are displaced across China per year. In most instances, the land is then sold to private developers at an average cost of 40 times higher per acre than the government paid to the villagers.\n\nThere are more than 90,000 civil disturbances in China each year, and an estimated 180,000 mass protests occurred in the country in 2010; grievances are often corruption or illegal land seizures. The Jamestown Foundation offers a macroscopic explanation for the rise in conflicts: that local officials, caught between local government revenue shortfalls due to measures by central government to cool the overheated property market and their personal ratings based on their contributions to GDP growth, have resorted to undercompensating villagers for land appropriations.\n\nFarmland in Lufeng city has been progressively giving way to new developments. Projects in recent years have included a palatial new government building and a sumptuous holiday hotel resort that contained a row of 60 luxury villas. A glitzy new \"Golden Sands\" nightclub is a new attraction that brings rich visitors from out of town. In 2011, villagers alleged local officials had grabbed hundreds of hectares of cooperative land and were \"secretly selling\" it to a real estate developer. According to a news analysis in \"The New York Times\", China's village committees are elected by the villagers themselves, and are thus theoretically the most representative forms of governance, yet most residents are unfamiliar with how the village system functions, and are unaware of their rights. The sale of collectivised land is supposed to require approval of the villagers under Chinese law, and the proceeds are supposed to be shared. However, the approval process lacks transparency in practice, and most decisions are taken by the elected village committee with the blessing of the Donghai township – the level of government just above Wukan. The residents of Wukan made allegations of corruption: five of the nine members of Wukan's village committee had held their posts since the creation of the committee system by Deng Xiaoping, and the village's Communist Party secretary, Xue Chang, has been in the position since 1970.\n\nResidents in several villages near Wukan alleged that village officials had confiscated their farm land and sold it to developers. The livelihoods of many were at stake: many were facing severe hardship with no land to till, and had difficulty buying food on their meagre urban incomes. Wukan villagers said that they were unaware of the sale until developers began construction work, and alleged that local Communist Party officials had profited from the sale of communal land, selling it for $1 billion RMB ($156 million USD) to Country Garden. Villagers asserted that 400 hectares of farmland had been appropriated without compensation since 1998. The villagers petitioned various levels of government in vain over the years, accused local cadres of \"pocketing more than 700 million yuan\" ($110 million USD), which should legally have gone to compensating local farmers, since 2006. Local officials blamed the villagers' concerns on \"troublemakers\" who were manipulating those who were \"unaware of the truth\".\n\nOn the morning of 21 September 2011, hundreds of villagers participated in a sit-in protest against local officials outside government offices in Lufeng. According to official statements, initially about 50 people shouting slogans and holding banners protested peacefully. Protesters hoisted banners and carried placards with slogans like \"give us back our farmland\" and \"let us continue farming\". Then as the crowd grew in numbers, protesters became restless and started damaging buildings and equipment in an industrial park in the village and blocking roads. Policemen were dispatched, and one villager said that they severely beat some teenagers who were banging on a gong to alert fellow villagers of the protest. Three villagers were arrested during the first day's violence. The next day, the police station was besieged by more than 100 villagers demanding the release of the detained villagers, and the violence escalated.\n\nThe news that several youngsters had been seriously injured after being set upon by 'thugs' caused hundreds of irate villagers armed with makeshift weapons to besiege a local police station, where 30 to 40 officials were sheltering. Hundreds of well-equipped riot police were dispatched, and they engaged in a stand-off with the farmers. Video footage shot by villagers in Wukan showed people of all ages being chased and beaten with truncheons by riot police. One Wukan villager described the police and other security staff as \"like mad dogs, beating everyone they saw\". The \"Financial Times\" reported that two children, aged nine and 13, were \"badly injured\", and that one may have died. Some villagers said that elderly people and children protesting peacefully were harassed and assaulted by \"hired thugs\", provoking an angry reaction from other villagers. The attacks on civilians by 400 police officers were described by the \"Financial Times\" as \"indiscriminate\".\n\nOne of the 'hired guns' bragged that he had been brought in by an influential businessman, who paid him RMB3,000 and promised him immunity from reprisals for any assaults. Officials blamed the escalating violence on \"rumours\" that police officers had beat a child to death. The official statement denied that any civilians had died. Internet news of the riots, including photos and videos, were quickly deleted by CCP censors. Press reported that searches on Sina Weibo (a microblog) for terms linked to Lufeng were blocked a short time after the protests began.\n\nOn the third day of unrest, the municipality of Shanwei, which has the responsibility for Lufeng, issued a statement saying that \"hundreds of villagers attacked government buildings\". It said \"more than a dozen police officers had been injured and '6 police vehicles had suffered damage'\". In what appeared to analysts as a change of tactics, observers noted that the authorities withdrew visible police presence for several days instead of stepping up police presence and suppressing the protesters more forcefully. Guangdong party chief Wang Yang also reassured residents by declaring that he was prepared to accept lower economic growth in Guangdong in exchange for increased harmony within the province. Jean Pierre Cabestan, a politics professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, suspected that the policing change was due to the political aspirations of Wang, who wants to \"survive and protect his image until next year\". Wang, a strongly-touted candidate for the politburo when the Hu / Wen generation retires, had been projecting a \"Happy Guangdong\" model of development to level the wealth gap and emphasise social harmony. Police only returned on the fourth day after the riots.\n\nAddressing the land dispute underlying the unrest, a senior official admitted that a sale of the land was planned, and interested property developers had already surveyed the site with local officials, but officials said that no contract had yet been signed. Guangdong media published reports that suggested protesters acted as mobs that assaulted and injured dozens of riot policemen. Villagers accused the press of blatant bias.\n\nThe Shanwei city government offered to appoint an inter-agency committee to delve into the land seizure allegations in exchange for an immediate end to the protests. Officials also said they would consider a fresh village election for clean and fair representatives to take part in future land negotiations. Because the government had agreed to deal with the issue openly and fairly, the villagers temporarily suspended their protests.\n\nThe local government agreed to negotiate with thirteen democratically elected officials from Wukan; but, before the negotiations could settle any of the villagers' disputes, three of the representatives were arrested. One of the representatives, Xue Jinbo (薛錦波) died in police custody under mysterious circumstances. After news of Xue's death became widely known, the villagers forcefully evicted local Communist Party officials and police from the village, leading to a blockade of the village by police.\n\nXue Jinbo was arrested by plainclothes police without a warrant in front of a restaurant just before noon (local time) on 9 December 2011. He was taken away in a minibus without licence plates. Four other village representatives were also detained on 9 December 2011.\n\nAt 11 pm in the evening of 11 December, a Lufeng City official, Huang, called Xue's daughter asking about Xue's full medical history, stating that Xue had been admitted to hospital in critical condition. Xue's daughter and wife went to the hospital at Shanwei in the following few hours, and were made to wait without having access to Xue. Officials told the Xue family that Xue Jinbo had arrived at a local prison at 7 am on 10 December and died at 10 am on 11 December. Other family members were contacted and arrived in Shanwei. Ten family members, including Xue's daughter and wife, were permitted to see Xue's body, but were prevented by police from using cameras and telephones.\n\nThe local police alleged that Xue had died suddenly of a heart attack after he had confessed to damaging property and disrupting public services, but his friends and family rejected this explanation, and believed that Xue had died after being subjected to police brutality.\nAccording to Xue's relatives, Xue's body showed signs of torture: it was covered in bruises and cuts, both his nostrils were caked with blood, his thumbs were bent and twisted backwards. His daughter said her father had \"a large bruise on his back suggested he had been kicked from behind.\" Xue's son-in-law Gao also noted that Xue's knees were bruised. Because Xue's clothes were clean, his family suggested that he had been stripped and then tortured. Xue's family refused official requests for an autopsy to be carried out.\n\nChina News Service reported on 14 December that Xue's family members agreed with medical examiners' verdict that Xue died of \"sudden cardiac failure\". Xinhua News stated that he had a history of asthma and heart disease that forensic investigators had found no evidence of abuse, and that Xue died of cardiac arrest at age 42 / 43. Xue's eldest daughter, Xue Jianwan, categorically denied to a Hong Kong online journal, \"iSun Affairs\", that her father had a history of heart problems. Villagers held a two-hour vigil for him at his home. Two post-mortem examinations were carried out: the first was undertaken by the Shanwei public security department, after which the family was informed that Xue had died of \"sudden cardiac death\". Following the family's protests, the authorities consented to a second autopsy, which was carried out by the medical examiner from Zhongshan University, Guangzhou. At no stage were any relatives present. The family said that the short written autopsy report given to them failed to address their queries.\n\nVillagers began holding daily protest meetings starting on 12 December. Throughout mid-December the villagers protested against the local government, waiting for the intervention of the central government and hoping that the central government would conduct an investigation.\n\nAfter the news of Xue's death became widely known in Wukan on December 14, residents stormed the local police station and clashed with police, forcing them and local Communist Party officials out of the village. After evacuating, the police cordoned off the area around the village and blocked the roads leading to it. The government dispatched a force of 1000 armed officers to maintain order, but it was unsuccessful in retaking control of the village. The authorities held the village in siege, preventing supplies from entering.\n\nLocal Communist Party officials accused the Wukan village representatives of being ringleaders of the protests. County-level official Wu Zili accused village representatives Lin Zuluan and Yang Semao of organizing and inciting the villagers to set up barricades around the village since 8 December (a day before Xue Jinbo was arrested): \"They did this to prevent officials from entering the village and to stop the perpetrators of the earlier riots from leaving the village and turning themselves into the authorities.\"\n\nOn 16 December, provincial Chinese officials \"vowed to temporarily halt questionable property sales and to investigate claims that the local government illegally confiscated farmland for private development\", according to official news media, but he police refused to release the body of Xue Jinbo to his family in order to have it buried. The same day, about 7000 people gathered for a ceremony for Xue Jinbo, and the standoff between villagers and authorities continued, with checkpoints from both sides set up around the village. Xue's son, Xue Jiandi, stated: \"Right now we have only one demand, and that is that they return the body of my father, he belongs to us, not to the government.\"\n\nProtesters continued to demonstrate while displaying banners pledging loyalty to the Communist Party. A villager reported that the government had offered rice and cooking oil – both of which were in low supply due to the blockade – to villagers who switch sides from the protesters and over to the government. The government gained at least a hundred supporters from the effort, but the stall was later shut down.\n\nOn 18 December, Lin Zuluan, one of Wukan's representatives, said that \"leaders at a higher level of local government summoned [him] for talks\" and that they wished to go to the village. Lin Zuluan refused the proposal, saying that there could be no talks until Xue's body was released, the four other village representatives held by police were released, and the villagers' land was returned. During the siege the villagers administered Wukan, , from a temple to the goddess of the sea, Mazu.\n\nA breakthrough occurred on 20 December when senior provincial officials intervened in the dispute and acknowledged villagers' basic demands. The officials admitted to mistakes in handling the grievances and vowed to crack down on corruption. On 21 December, after 3 tense days, the village representatives and government representatives reached a peaceful agreement for the villagers to stand down and cancel their march. In return, Xue's corpse would be released, and those detained by police would go free. The provincial government also agreed to make the village's financial records public, to dismiss and investigate two local officials identified by villagers as responsible for the incident, to address flaws in electing local officials, and to redistribute land which had been confiscated by the local government.\n\nA survey conducted on 19 December by the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong indicates strong coverage outside mainland China, but none of the 200+ newspapers inside the country published any articles. The story was extensively covered in \"Ming Pao\" and \"Apple Daily\" in Hong Kong; abroad, articles were published by the \"Financial Times\", Reuters, \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\" and others. 58 articles were surveyed across the region in total, of which 37 were from Hong Kong, 6 from Taiwan, 14 from Malaysia and 1 from Singapore.\n\nSome Sina Weibo microbloggers told the BBC that internet searches related to Wukan and the area were blocked after the December uprising started, and villagers' microblogs were deleted. Web users reacted by using alternative terms to refer to the events.\n\nIn an undated video circulated to the national media, Zheng Yanxiong blamed the media for his woes in front of a group of local officials and village representatives, saying that cadres like him were the only ones facing increasing hardship every year: \"Our powers decline every day, and fewer and fewer methods are at our disposal. But responsibility becomes bigger and bigger ... Ordinary people have bigger and bigger appetites, and become smarter every day. They are harder and harder to control.\" This attitude was lampooned in an opinion piece in \"The Standard\".\n\nXinhua and various state media, which had previously hardly reported the dispute, started publishing articles on 22 December that praised the provincial government for its handling of the event. In a \"Global Times\" article, a public policy professor at Renmin University praised the provincial government's \"evenhanded resolution\" of the issue. He said: \"The intervention is hard-earned progress, which rebutted previous claims by local authorities that the villagers had organized the protests 'out of malicious attempts'.\" Lin Zhe, professor at the Party School of the Party Central Committee, criticised local officials for having \"poor sense of law and long-term neglect of the public's rights and interests,\" and said that the escalation of the dispute into violence would not have occurred if local authorities had \"properly studied the complaints at the initial stages.\"\n\nDuring the protests, media including the BBC and the New York Times described the protests as \"larger\", \"unusual for their longevity\", and \"a likely first in China's modern history\". \"The Wall Street Journal\" declared the protests \"[2011's] most serious case of mass unrest in China\". However, after the protests' peaceful resolution, \"The Atlantic\" concluded that they were \"not as unusual as it might have seemed\" in the context of China's many small land and labor disputes, describing as \"typical\" the protestors' pledges of loyalty to the Communist Party of China. Al Jazeera English has produced a four-part observational documentary series about Wukan's transition to democracy.\n\nFollowing the standoff in December, protest leader Lin Zuluan was named the new Communist Party secretary of Wukan. As part of the truce with authorities, the governor of Guangdong, Wang Yang, acquiesced to a village election in Wukan: the first of its kind to employ a secret ballot. A series of three elections was planned, which would select 100 representatives to oversee the village's governing committee.\n\nDuring the first round of elections on 1 February, some 6,000 Wukan villagers voted for an independent committee to supervise elections for a new village leadership. On 11 February, over 6,500 villagers (85% of the population) voted to elect 107 village representatives, with protester leader Lin Zuluan as village Party chief replacing the ousted leader, who had held the position for 42 years. The young Xue Jianwan, the daughter of the deceased protesters leader, Xue Jinbo, was also elected. According to \"WSJ\" writer Josh Chin, the election appeared to be \"free of the Communist Party meddling that typically mars Chinese election results.\"\n\nSeveral other villages in China have drawn inspiration from the Wukan protests.\n\n\nObservers have credited the peaceful resolution of the Wukan protests to the intervention of the Communist Party chief in Guangdong, Wang Yang. By demonstrating his ability to resolve the issue peacefully, Wang has improved his reputation within the Party as a peacemaker who listens and responds to the interests of the people that he serves.\n\nThe citizens of Wukan welcomed intervention by Wang's government, and Wang has capitalized on the popularity of his approach since late December 2011. In a meeting with the Guangdong Party congress in January 2012, Wang pledged to use his \"Wukan approach\" to improve village politics throughout the province. Wang, commenting on his resolution of the protests, has stated that it \"was not only meant to solve problems in the village, but also to set a reference standard to reform village governance across Guangdong.\"\n\nVillagers began marching in protest daily since mid-June 2016 after the arrest of protest leader Lin Zulian (formerly known as Lin Zuluan), an elected leader of the village. Lin, 72, had written a letter to the village on March 2 complaining of continued corruption. Seized land had been \"raped by power, money, and gangsters,\" he wrote. This protest letter followed multiple attempts to gain redress from direct contact with the developer, Hua Hui Real Estate, that had acquired a 110,000 square meter plot of land in Wukan without the approval of the village committee. The company gave a perfunctory response, and the Lufeng government, in which Wukan resides, later stated that the land did not belong to the villagers. On June 18, after calls for \"renewed mass protests\" over land seizures, Lin was arrested by special police who broke into his walled house in the middle of the night.\n\nIn an enquiry about the land deal and treatment of Lin, the Lufeng government said that it \"has not discovered any situation of unfair suppression or punishment.\"\n\nLin later appeared on state TV admitting that he had taken bribes for government contracts. This sparked protests, with thousands marching accusing the government of forcing the confession.\n\nAttempts by Lin and other village leaders to gain legal representation have been met with resistance by the authorities. Lin's family reportedly hired the civil rights lawyer Ge Yongxi, including a retainer fee. The judicial authorities later made them return the funds, however. \"The firm was banned from accepting any client from Wukan village, which obviously interferes with our normal, legal business... He should not be denied the right of legal counsel, whether he has taken any bribe or not,\" Ge told South China Morning Post.\n\nOn September 13, new reports emerged that riot police had again repressed Wukan protesters.\n\nAt the end of December 2016 a Chinese court sentenced nine of the villagers to prison terms between two and ten years for illegal assembly, blocking traffic and disrupting public order.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1126571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1126571", "title": "Zoroastrian Dari language", "text": "Zoroastrian Dari language\n\nZoroastrian Dari ( literally Behdīnān dialect) is a Northwestern Iranian ethnolect spoken as a first language by an estimated 8,000 to 15,000 Zoroastrians in and around the cities of Yazd and Kerman in central Iran, but until the 1880s was spoken by almost a million people in Central Iran. The ethnolect is often overlooked by linguists because the region is predominantly Muslim and because Dari is primarily spoken (rarely written). Dari is a Persian dialect.\n\nDari is also known as Behdināni or pejoratively as Gabri (sometimes Gavrŭni or Gabrōni). Dari has numerous dialects. there are certain differences compared to new Persian, though it is still a Persian dialect related to middle Persian Pahlavi.\n\nGenealogically, Dari Persian is a member of the Northwestern Iranian language subfamily, which includes several other closely related languages, for instance, Zazaki and Balochi. These Northwestern Iranian languages are a branch of the larger Western Iranian language group, which is in turn a subgroup of the Iranian language family.\n\nThe language known as Zoroastrian Dari is also referred to as 'Behdinâni' (\"language of the people of good religion\") or pejorative yet common name, 'Gabri' (\"language of the infidels\"). The roots of the name 'Gabri' date back to Muslim invasion of Iran and is resented by indigenous speakers of Dari to refer to their language. As Farudi and Toosarvandani point out: \"For them, choosing to call their language Dari, the speakers of the language invoke their ancestral connections to a pre-Islamic Iran.\"\n\nThe Dari language has traditionally been divided into two main dialects: the variety spoken in Yazd and the one spoken in Kerman. This division of the language, based on the division of its speakers into their two main cities of residence, conceals the complexity of the actual dialectical situation. The Yazdi dialect itself has some thirty varieties, each distinct and unique to one of the Zoroastrian neighborhoods in and around Yazd. The variation amongst the Yazdi dialects is so great that, were it not for their geographic proximity, they would no doubt be classified as distinct dialects. The Kermani dialect may also contain (or may have contained at one time) a comparable level of dialectical complexity.\n\nAlthough Dari has been generally considered quintessential to Zoroastrian identity, but the vitality of it is being affected, or has been affected in the past, by two main types of pressure: economic and political.\n\nThe pressures affecting the vitality of Dari Persian today are largely economic. In order to obtain an economic advantage, speakers are giving up their traditional language for the dominant language of Iran, standard new Persian. Parents intentionally do not transmit Dari to their children in order that they may have what is felt to be an advantage in school and in life. The language loss can also occur more indirectly and less visibly when people move to larger urban centers or abroad in pursuit of better economic opportunities; the lack of a complete language environment in which to immerse a child decreases or completely inhibits the transmission of the language to new generations.\n\nIn past times, Dari speakers have experienced political pressures to yield up their language as well. The period since the seventh-century Muslim conquest of Persia has been a time of great persecution for the Zoroastrians of Iran. Political pressures have directly resulted in language loss when Zoroastrians have deliberately abandoned their language as a means of hiding their identity so as to escape persecution. Political pressures have also led to language loss indirectly; the oppression the Zoroastrians have been experienced under Iran’s various rulers over the past thousand or so years has driven a steady stream of Zoroastrians to more tolerant areas, mostly the capital, Tehran, or abroad. Again, a complete language environment does not exist in these places, inhibiting the transmission of Dari to new generations.\n\nLinguists currently consider Dari to be in a state of language shift. Many of the language’s speakers have assimilated to the dominant culture of the society they live in and have given up—intentionally or unintentionally—their traditional language. Languages like Dari are transferring from a state of language maintenance, in which a language is being sustained in the face of pressure from a dominant culture, to language death, a state in which the language is no longer spoken.\n\nMany of Dari’s dialects are facing extinction at an even more rapid pace than the language as a whole. Since each of Dari’s many dialects has a smaller community of speakers, they are more susceptible to the forces driving the language towards extinction. Some dialects have already effectively reached extinction, for example, the Mohammadabad dialect, which, it is reported, possesses only a few speakers living in Tehran. The Kerman dialect, always susceptible because of the smaller size of its Zoroastrian population, also seems to be largely lost.\n\n\n\nFor further reading, see\n"}
