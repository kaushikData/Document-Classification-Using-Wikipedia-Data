The coup killed Khaled Mosharraf who had removed those involved in the Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from power. The coup also freed Ziaur Rahman from house arrest and allowed him to eventually seize power and become president.\n\nBangladesh became an Independent country in 1971 through the Bangladesh Liberation war. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the socialist Bangladesh Awami League became the first president of Bangladesh. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the President of Bangladesh, was killed in the 15 August 1975 military coup. Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad replaced him as the President of Bangladesh. Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad replaced the Bangladesh Army chief, Major General K M Shafiullah, with Major General Ziaur Rahman, the deputy Army chief. Pakistan welcome the removal of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and China and Saudi Arabia established diplomatic ties with Bangladesh. Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf, the chief of general staff, had asked Ziaur Rahman for the chain of command in Bangladesh Army to be restored, Ziaur Rahman proved unwilling or unable to do so. There was discontent in the Army and Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and officers like Colonel Shafaat Jamil and Lieutenant Colonel A.T.M Haider planned to remove Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad from power.\n\nKhondakar Mostaq Ahmad was himself removed from power through the military coup on 5 November 1975. He was removed from power by Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and Lieutenant Colonel A.T.M Haider. Khaled Mosharraf forced Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad to resign but listed to Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad's request that the assassins of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman be given safe passage out of Bangladesh. Before the assassins left Bangladesh they had killed Awami league leaders and former Vice President Syed Nazrul Islam, former Prime Minister Muhammad Mansur Ali, former Minister Abul Hasnat Muhammad Qamaruzzaman and former prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed who were imprisoned in Dhaka Central Jail after the 15 August military coup. Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad was replaced by the Chief Justice of Bangladesh, Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, who became the next president.\n\nRumours were spread in cantonments in Bangladesh that said Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf and Lieutenant Colonel A.T.M Haider were Indian agents who would give Bangladesh over to India. Colonel Abu Taher organised soldiers loyal to him and Major General Ziaur Rahman to replace the government. They launched the coup on 7 November 1975. Khaled Mosharraf and Lieutenant Colonel A.T.M Haider tried to resist the coup but failed, they were killed by the Army soldiers. Colonel Abu Taher had resigned from the Army in September 1972 and joined the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. Soldiers in the street shouted Nara-e-Takbeer and Sepoy-Janata Zindabad.\n\nIt was suggested Colonel Abu Taher was involved in the death of Brigadier Khaled Mosharraf. Chief of Army staff Major General Ziaur Rahman who was placed under house arrest by Khaled Mosharraf was freed. The coup created the path for Ziaur Rahman to take over the government. Colonel Abu Taher was hanged on July 1976 by President Ziaur Rahman.\n\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party, founded by Ziaur Rahman after he became President, remembers this day as National Revolution and Solidarity Day and celebrates it annually while the Bangladesh Awami League calls it Freedom Fighters Killing Day and views it negatively. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party called the military coup a civil military uprising.\n"}

The Adygeans (of Adygea) speak the Adyghe language.\n\nThe Adyge people are one of the Circassian peoples, along with the Cherkess (of Karachay-Cherkessia) and Kabards (of Kabardino-Balkaria), from whom they are geographically separated by the Slav-inhabited Laba region. The languages of the Adygeans, Cherkess and Kabards are mutually intelligible, however, there is a consensus that these are typologically distinct languages. The standard (literary) Adyghe language is based on the dialect of the Temirgoy tribe.\n\nThe Adygeans, known as \"western Circassians\" per Soviet terminology from the 1930s, use a written language separated by Soviet policy from those of the Cherkess (\"central Circassians\") and Kabards (\"eastern Circassians\"), despite the possibility to have a unified one. The Adyghe-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast was established in July 1922, \"Cherkess\" being dropped from the name in August 1936.\n\nThe Circassian peoples are divided into tribes or clans (\"tlapq\"). There are ten Adyghe tribes (or subgroups), out of which four are identified as speaking mutually intelligible Adyghe dialects: Abzakh, Bzhedug, Temirgoy and Shapsug.\nThe Shapsug were counted as a separate ethnic group in the censuses.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census of Russia, the number of self-declared ethnic \"Adyghe\" is 124,835 (0.09%). The community included 107,048 in Adygea itself (ca. 25% of the republic's population), 13,834 in Krasnodar Krai, 569 in Moscow. The majority of the population in Adygea declare as Russians (63.6%). In 2002 it was estimated that the community numbered 131,000 in all of Russia. The other closely related groups, Kabards and Cherkess, numbered 516,826 (0.38%) and 73,184 (0.05%), respectively. Those that declared as Shapsug, who speak an Adyghe dialect and are regarded an Adyghe subgroup, numbered 3,882.\n\nThere is a significant Adyghe diaspora. It was estimated in 1997 that there were 71,000 Adyghe-speakers in Turkey, 44,000 in Jordan, and 25,000 in Syria.\n\nThe political history of the Adyghe in Adygea since the Russian Revolution is complex. On 27 July 1922, a Circassian (Adygea) Autonomous Oblast was established in the Kuban-Black Sea Oblast, which would later become Krasnodar Krai. After several name changes, the Adyghe Autonomous Oblast was established on 3 August 1928. On 5 October 1990, the Adygea ASSR was proclaimed and separated from Krasnodar Krai. On 24 March 1992, it became the Republic of Adygea. A significant population of the Adyghe community now lives in the Black Sea region of Northern Turkey where their culture is preserved in villages in the area.\n\n"}

Unlike Standard Tibetan, the Baima language does not use a written script, although a hieroglyphic system is used in religious practice. In religion, they still keep ancient nature worship and totem worship, which practices were later influenced by Bon, and in some degree they also believe Buddhism and Daoism, but there are no temples or lamas (monks). To many of the Baima, the Mountain God is the highest god. The most important religious event for them is the Caogai Dance (曹蓋, which means domino in Baima).\n\nThe Baima people are said to be the descendants of Baima Di (白馬氐) and after Songtsen Gampo established the Tibetan Empire, they gradually became part of the Tibetan people. The Di (氐) were an ancient large ethnic group living in west China who were associated with the Qiang (羌), also called Di Qiang (氐羌). The change from their original Di language to Amdo Tibetan probably took place in the 7th century CE. The area Baima people live in is the region that was previously called Jiandi Dao (湔氐道) before the Tibetan empire was established.\n\n"}

One of the most influential accounts of the group comes from historian Edward Thompson, who construed the organization as integral to the birth of British working-class consciousness. Others, including J.R. Dinwiddy, have argued that Thompson may have been entirely mistaken in theorizing a revolutionary tradition in contemporary Yorkshire, claiming that the group may not have existed at all. The very name, some have asserted, may be a misreading of the description \"Black Lump\". Some have asserted that the organization coalesced around economic rather than political interests; historian Richard Brown concludes that both factors are likely to have played a part.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7148217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7148217", "title": "Boobs on Bikes", "text": "Boobs on Bikes\n\nBoobs on Bikes is a mostly annual parade of topless men and women riding on motorcycles through large New Zealand cities (in the past, Christchurch, Palmerston North, Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington, Wanganui and most prominently Auckland).\n\nIt is organised by pornographer Steve Crow, and started in Auckland in 2003 after two local women were arrested for baring their breasts in a public protest. Crow considered this to be a breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, which specifically prohibits discrimination of the basis of sex and Crow argued that if it is legal in New Zealand for a male to bare his breast in public, the same must apply to women. Several legal attempts to stop the parade, most notably by Auckland City Council, have failed in court and the parade has been ruled legal under New Zealand legislation.\n\nCrow has run his Boobs on Bikes parade a number of times since 2003. The event normally precedes Crow's \"Erotica Expo\",\nor as it is more correctly known, \"Erotica Lifestyles Expo\", an adults-only adult lifestyles exhibition. International porn stars who travel to New Zealand for the expo are typically part of Boobs On Bikes.\n\nIn 2006, the parade, then much smaller and less known, made headlines in Auckland, when Steve Crow asked for permission from the city council, which was granted. Strong political opposition later materialized from parts of the public and some politicians, including mayor Dick Hubbard and most of the Auckland City Councillors. \nLegal experts, however, concluded that the parade could not be denied by current laws (bare-breasted women not being an indecency in New Zealand in this age, as a police spokesman noted). Also, the organizers had technically asked only for assistance with traffic control for the parade and declared themselves determined to go ahead even in the face of opposition.\nThe acrimonious debate about the parade ensured that when the parade took place several weeks later, Queen Street was packed with spectators. Rough counts estimate around one hundred thousand people, \nof which about one fifth were reported to be female. \nThe 2006 parade contained about fifteen to twenty female pornstars on 26 bikes and two decommissioned army tanks.\n\nThe 2007 Christchurch \"Boobs on Bikes\" parade was held on March 2. This parade received less national media attention than the Auckland parade the year before, as unlike in Auckland, there was no attempt by city councillors to prevent it. However, Christchurch City Council did release a press statement stating that they had \"not approved or received an application to hold the proposed 'Boobs on Bikes' parade on Friday, March 2, from Erotica event organisers.\" The press release stated that the council must be consulted for any procession that will interfere with traffic, or may require crowd management. Erotica Lifestyle Expo organiser Steve Crow has brushed this off, saying that it is a promotion, not a parade, and all rules of the road will be observed.\n\nCity council and organizers of the event say they had received numerous complaints about the parade; however, it isn't in the city's jurisdiction to act, as female toplessness is not illegal in New Zealand. Council transport and streets manager Michael Aitken told NZPA that the \"standard of dress of participants is not a matter that the Council can control.\"\n\nPolice inspector Gary Knowles commented that it was a \"moral not a criminal issue. We have taken legal advice and unless there is a breach of the peace, we cannot intervene.\"\n\nIn March 2010, the Protect Our Youth Association began soliciting signatures for a petition against the parade, however the petition effort was abandoned after then Whanganui Mayor Michael Laws stated to P.O.Y.A. representative Holly Dahya that he would ignore any petitions against the parade, and rejected any alternative recourse to council. Laws also rejected Wanganui City Councillor Allan Anderson's attempts to open discussion on the issue within Council itself, recognising that repeated attempts by Auckland City Council to prevent the event had failed.\n\nCrow also angered Palmerston North RSA members when he announced his parades in Palmerston North, Whanganui and Levin would take place over ANZAC weekend, with the Erotica Lifesyle Expo in Palmerston North scheduled for ANZAC day itself. In response to critics, Crow stated that it was an 'unfortunate clash of date' outside his control as that weekend (ANZAC weekend) was the only weekend available for the use of the venue.\n\n"}

The most remarkable characteristics of the region is the human domination over the nature: only ~5% of the native vegetation is left. Other very strong characteristic is populational and economic: most industries are concentrated in the area and responsible for ~75% of the national GDP. The vast majority of the population (+90%) is of mostly European ancestry, and more than half of the population self-identify as White Brazilian.\n\nThe region also is characterized by having a high standard of living (HDI of ~0.787, in average), where social problems are less problematic than in other regions (at least, in rural and small-medium-sized cities).\n\nIt is not difficult to find regions and small, medium and large cities whose quality of life is similar to developed coutries.\n\nSimilar conditions to those of the First World are difficult to find in the geo-economic regions \"Amazônia Legal\" and \"Nordeste\", in \"Amazonia Legal\" the exception is the Mato Grosso in the agribusiness belt, but the state belongs to Central-West macro-region, \nnot to the North and Northeast, where most of the Brazilian poverty is concentrated.\n\nThe \"Centro Sul\" can often be understood as the such as the junction of South, Southeast and Central-West macro-regions, although the division does not include the north of Minas Gerais and most of Mato Grosso, besides including a very small part of the Tocantins, that in the North.\n\nThis understanding is due to the fact that the three macro-regions present similar social indicators, higher than the North and Northeast.\n\nDespite detaining the majority of the Brazilian population there is a common sense that the Centro-Sul (except the favela minority in large cities) is the least representative of the country's reality, this is due to the high social indicators that go against the concept that the country is underdeveloped.\n\nThis misconception is even more so in relation to the South, due mainly to the temperate climate, European immigration and way of life very close to the developed countries.\n\nAlthough it was always the richest geoeconomic region, the resemblance to the First World is recent, even in the South, which in the 1980s was much poorer than the neighboring countries of Uruguay and Argentina.\n\nOnly the state of São Paulo presents better indicators for a longer time, due to the strong industrialization, the development of the South and Central-West regions occurred less recently with the expansion of agribusiness.\n\nThe \"Centro Sul\" now has similar development to that of Uruguay, Argentina and Chile, the richest South and Latin American countries, extreme poverty is almost eradicated in this part of Brazil while in the North and Northeast the rates are still very expressive, the similarities with the developed countries are even more evident in the South, especially Santa Catarina state, and São Paulo state. \n\nhttps://exame.abril.com.br/brasil/55-das-cidades-brasileiras-tem-desenvolvimento-medio/\nhttp://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.DDAY\n"}
{"id": "11988183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11988183", "title": "Chaldean Catholics", "text": "Chaldean Catholics\n\nChaldean Catholics (), known simply as Chaldeans (\"Kaldāye\"; or ), are Assyrian adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church which originates from the Church of the East.\n\nThe community formed in the Upper Mesopotamia in the 16th and 17th centuries, originating from groups of Nestorians adhering to the Church of the East that split after the schism of 1552 and entered communion with the Holy See (Catholic Church). While indigenous to the region of north Iraq, southeast Turkey and northeast Syria, many Chaldean Catholic Christians have migrated to Western countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, Sweden and Germany. Many of them also live in Lebanon, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Iran, Turkey, and Georgia. The reasons for migration are religious persecution, ethnic persecution, the poor economic conditions during the sanctions against Iraq, and poor security conditions after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nFollowers of the Chaldean Catholic Church identify and are identified as \"Chaldean\" (\"kaldāye\", \"kaldāni\", ultimately from ancient \"Chaldea\"). After the community entered communion with Rome, the Roman Catholic Church began calling them Chaldean Catholics, wanting to differentiate them from the followers of their mother church, the Nestorians (since the 20th century called Assyrians). In the past, the Chaldean name was used for both branches, but never became attached to the Nestorians. The Jacobites (Syriac Orthodox) and Nestorians had up until after World War I called themselves \"Syrians\" (Suraye/Suroyo), after which the Nestorians gradually adopted \"Aturaye\" (ancient Assyrian name in Syriac) while the Jacobites continued calling themselves \"Suroyo\". 19th-century Western travel and missionary writers had popularized the Assyrian name, which was first adopted by a few educated Nestorians (especially immigrants in America) in the late 19th century. In the Interwar period, in some regions, the label \"Assyrians\" also included Chaldeans, leading to the designation \"Catholic Assyrians\". However, the Assyrian name did not win approval in the majority of the Chaldean population. In recent times, the term \"Chaldo-Assyrian\" has gained popularity; it presents Chaldeans and Nestorians as one ethnic group.\n\nIn Iraq, the Chaldeans grouped together with Nestorians are officially known as \"Chaldo-Assyrian\" (as per Law of 2003). Iraqi Kurdish organizations often refer to Syriac Christians as Kurdish Christians, while \"Chaldo-Assyrian\" is the preferred name of the Assyrian Democratic Movement.\n\nThere are 640,828 adherents of the Chaldean Church worldwide according to the \"Annuario Pontificio\".\n\nChaldeans are mentioned as a distinct group in Article 125 of the Iraqi constitution. In northern Iraq, the community inhabits Alqosh (), Ankawa (), Araden (), Baqofah (), Batnaya (), Karamles (), Mangesh (), Shaqlawa (), Tel Isqof (), Tel Keppe () and Zakho ().\n\nIn Syria, adherents number 10,000; 48,594 in Turkey; 3,390 in Iran.\n\nIn Southeast Michigan there is a Chaldean community numbering 113,000 people. This is the largest Chaldean diaspora community outside Iraq. Members are Arabic- or Aramaic-speaking.\n\nA small number of Chaldean Catholic families live in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Occasionally the Chaldean Patriarchate has tried to administer them through the Chaldean street residence of a currently vacant Chaldean Patriarchal Exarch in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Chaldean community originates from groups of adherents of the Church of the East that entered into communion with the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th and 17th centuries. The community emerged after the schism of 1552. These \"Nestorian\" Uniates received the name \"Chaldeans\" from the Roman Curia, which had given the ancient name \"Chaldaei\" to them.\n\nThe term \"Chaldean\" in reference to followers of the Chaldean Catholic Church was historically mainly a denominational term which arose in the late 17th century and became fully established in the 19th century. It did not refer to an ethnic connection with ancient south Babylonian Chaldea and its inhabitants, which emerged during the 9th century BC after Chaldean tribes migrated from the Levant region of Urfa in North Mesopotamia to southeast Mesopotamia, and disappeared from history during the 6th century BC.\n\nChaldean Catholics are regarded ethnically and historically as a part of the Assyrian continuity. The modern Chaldean Catholics originated from ancient Assyrian communities living in and indigenous to the north of Iraq/Mesopotamia which was known as Assyria from the 25th century BC until the 7th century AD. Chaldean Catholics largely bear the same family and personal names, share the same genetic profile, hail from the same villages, towns and cities in northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northeast Syria and northwest Iran, as fellow Assyrians of other religious denominations. The Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic and Surayt/Turoyo languages do not run parallel to the often associated religious denominations (Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church).\n\nAccording to a 1950 CIA report on Iraq, Chaldeans numbered 98,000 and were the largest Christian minority.\n\nA 1950 CIA report on Iraq estimated 98,000 Chaldeans, 30,000 Nestorians (Assyrians), 25,000 Syriac Catholics and 12,000 Jacobites.\n\nAccording to estimates by the Catholic Church, in Chaldean dioceses in Iraq there were 150,000 Catholics in the Archdiocese of Baghdad (2015), 30,000 in the Archeparchy of Arbil (2012), 22,300 in the Diocese of Alqosh (2012), 18,800 in the Diocese of Amadiyah and Zaku (2015), 14,100 in the Archeparchy of Mossul (2013), 7,831 in the Archdiocese of Kerkūk (2013), 1,372 in Diocese of Aqrā (2012), 800 in Archeparchy of Bassorah (2015),\n\nMany Chaldean Catholics identify as Assyrians or Chaldo-Assyrians. Raphael Bidawid, the then patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church commented on the Assyrian name dispute in 2003:\n\nIn an interview with the Assyrian Star in the September–October 1974 issue, he was quoted as saying:\n\nSome Chaldean Catholics espouse a Chaldean ethnic identity and regard Chaldeans as a nation of its own. Some claim descent from the ancient Chaldeans/Chaldees, who resided in the far south east of Mesopotamia, however, the scholary consensus remains that modern Chaldean Catholics constitute part of the Assyrian continuity rather than being descendants of the ancient Chaldeans. The first political movement of Chaldean Catholics was founded in 1972 in Iraq and named the Chaldean Patriot Movement, after the Baathist regime in Iraq killed many Chaldean Catholics in the Soria village in the Dohuk province, but then this movement dissolved after persecution by the Baath regime. Official statistics in Iraq referred to all Syriac Christians, including Chaldean Catholics, as \"Christian Arabs\". In 1972, the cultural rights of Syriac-speaking Christians in Iraq were recognised by the Iraqi government, but the Baathist regime refused to recognize Assyrians (Syriac Christians) as an ethnic group.\n\nAfter the fall of the Baath regime in Iraqi Kurdistan in 1991, some Chaldean Catholics began to establish Chaldean nationalist political parties around the Chaldean Catholic identity, in 1999 founded the Chaldean Democratic Party and in 2002 the Chaldean National Congress Party. Upon their demands, the Iraqi constitution of 2005 in Article 125 mentions Chaldeans as a distinct group. Several conferences on Chaldean nationalism were held, and a flag was designed.\n\nThe 1896 census of the Chaldean Catholics counted 233 parishes and 177 churches or chapels, mainly in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey. The Chaldean Catholic clergy numbered 248 priests; they were assisted by the monks of the Congregation of St. Hormizd, who numbered about one hundred. There were about 52 Assyrian Chaldean schools (not counting those conducted by Latin nuns and missionaries). At Mosul there was a patriarchal seminary, distinct from the Chaldean seminary directed by the Dominicans. The total number of Assyrian Chaldean Christians as by 2010 was 490,371, 78,000 of whom are in the Diocese of Mosul.\n\nThe current patriarch considers Baghdad as the principal city of his see. His title of \"Patriarch of Babylon\" results from the identification of Baghdad with ancient Babylon (however Baghdad is 55 miles north of the ancient city of Babylon and corresponds to northern Babylonia). However, the Chaldean patriarch resides habitually at Mosul in the north, and reserves for himself the direct administration of this diocese and that of Baghdad.\n\nThere are five archbishops (resident respectively at Basra, Diyarbakır, Kirkuk, Salmas and Urmia) and seven bishops. Eight patriarchal vicars govern the small Assyrian Chaldean communities dispersed throughout Turkey and Iran. The Chaldean clergy, especially the monks of Rabban Hormizd Monastery, have established some missionary stations in the mountain districts dominated by The Assyrian Church of the East. Three dioceses are in Iran, the others in Turkey.\n\nThe liturgical language of the Chaldean Catholic Church is Syriac and the liturgy of the Chaldean Church is written in the Syriac alphabet. The literary revival in the early 20th century was mostly due to the Lazarist Pere Bedjan, an ethnic Assyrian Chaldean Catholic from northwestern Iran. He popularized the ancient chronicles, the lives of Assyrian saints and martyrs, and even works of the ancient Assyrian doctors among Assyrians of all denominations, including Chaldean Catholics, Syriac Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East and Assyrian Protestants.\n\nBefore the Gulf War, Chaldean Catholics numbered approximately 400,000 of Iraq's estimated 800,000-1,000,000 Assyrian Christians, with smaller numbers found among the Assyrian Christian communities of northeast Syria, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Georgia and Armenia. Perhaps the best known Iraqi Chaldean Catholic is the former Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz (real name Michael Youhanna).\n\nHundreds of thousands of Assyrian Christians of all denominations have left Iraq since the ousting of Saddam Hussein in 2003. At least 20,000 of them have fled through Lebanon to seek resettlement in Europe and the US. In March 2008, Chaldean Catholic Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho of Mosul was kidnapped, and found dead two weeks later. Pope Benedict XVI condemned his death. Sunni and Shia leaders also expressed their condemnation. As political changes sweep through many Arab nations, the ethnic Assyrian minorities throughout the Middle East have expressed concern about the developments and their future in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The festival date is based on the lunar cycle of the lunisolar Hindu calendar, it being the first day of the year and the Sindhi month of \"Chet\" (Chaitra). It typically falls in late March or early April in the Gregorian calendar on or about the same day as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra and Ugadi in other parts of the Deccan region of India.\n\nThe festival marks the arrival of spring and harvest, but in Sindhi community it also marks the mythical birth of Uderolal in year 1007, after they prayed to Hindu god Varuna to save them from the persecution by tyrannical Muslim ruler named Mirkhshah. Uderolal morphed into a warrior and old man who preached and reprimanded Mirkhshah that Muslims and Hindus deserve the same religious freedoms. He, as Jhulelal, became the champion of the people in Sindh, from both religions. Among his Sufi Muslim followers, Jhulelal is known as \"Khwaja Khizir\" or \"Sheikh Tahit\". The Hindu Sindhi, according to this legend, celebrate the new year as Uderolal's birthday.\n\nThe tradition likely started with Daryapanthis. During the British colonial rule era, major annual fairs (\"melas\") used to be held in Uderolal and Zindapir (near Hyderabad, Pakistan). In contemporary times, the Sindhi community celebrates the festival of Cheti Chand with major fairs, feast parties, processions with \"jhankis\" (glimpse stage) of Jhulelal (an avatar of Vishnu, similar to Vithoba), other Hindu deities, and social dancing.\n\nOn this day, many Sindhis take Baharana Sahib to a nearby river or lake. Baharana Sahib consists of Jyot (oil lamp), Misiri (crystal sugar), Fota (cardamom), Fal (fruits), and Akha. Behind is Kalash (water jar) and a Nariyal (coconut) in it, covered with cloth, phool (flowers) and patta (leaves). There is also a Murti (statue) of Pujya Jhulelal Devta. It has been a major festival of Sindhis in India and Pakistan, one also celebrated by the Sindhi diaspora around the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "7578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7578", "title": "Corsican language", "text": "Corsican language\n\nCorsican (\"corsu\" or \"lingua corsa\" ) is a Romance language within the Italo-Dalmatian subfamily. It is closely related to Tuscan, and thus to Tuscan-based Italian. In its Northern varieties especially, mutual intelligibility between Corsican and Italian is high. Varieties of Corsican are spoken, and to some extent written, on the islands of Corsica (France) and northern Sardinia (Italy). Corsican used to play the role of a vernacular, while Italian was the official language in Corsica until 1859; afterwards Italian was replaced by French, owing to the acquisition of the island by France from the Republic of Genoa in 1768. Over the next two centuries, the use of French grew to the extent that, by the Liberation in 1945, all islanders had a working knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a wholesale language shift, with islanders changing their language practices to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65 percent of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican, and a small minority, perhaps 10 percent, used Corsican as a first language.\n\nAs for Corsican, a bone of contention is whether it should be considered an Italian dialect or its own language. Usually, it is not possible to ascertain what an author means by these terms. For example, one might read from some scholars that Corsican either belongs to the \"Centro-Southern Italian dialects\" along with Tuscan and the Tuscan-based standard Italian, Neapolitan and others or that it is \"closely related to the Tuscan dialect of Italian\". \n\nThe matter is controversial, as the island was historically and culturally bound to the Italian Mainland from the Middle Ages up until the 19th century, and installed in a diglossic system where both Corsican and Italian were perceived as two sociolinguistic levels of the same language; Corsican and Italian traditionally existed on a spectrum, whose proximity line was blurred enough that the locals needed little else but a change of register to communicate with the standard Italian-speaking elites and administration. \"Tuscanising\" their tongue allowed for a practice of code-mixing typical of the Mainland Italian dialects. Despite the geographical proximity, it has indeed been noted that the closest linguistic neighbour to Corsican is not Sardinian, which is a separate group, but rather Tuscan and the extreme Southern Italian lects like Siculo-Calabrian.\n\nOne of the characteristics of standard Italian is the retention of the -\"re\" infinitive ending, as in Latin \"mittere\" \"send\". Such infinitival ending is lost in Tuscan as well as Corsican, which has \"mette\" / \"metta\", \"to put\". The Latin relative pronouns \"qui\"/\"quae\" \"who\", and \"quod\" \"what\", are inflected in Latin; whereas the relative pronoun in Italian for \"who\" is \"chi\" and \"what\" is \"che\"/\"(che) cosa\", it is an uninflected \"chì\" in Corsican. The biggest difference between standard Italian and Corsican is that the latter uses the \"u\" termination, whereas standard Italian uses the \"o\" ending. For example, the Italian demonstrative pronouns \"questo\" \"this\" and \"quello\" \"that\" become in Corsican \"questu\" or \"quistu\" and \"quellu\" or \"quiddu\". This feature was typical of the early Italian texts during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Corsican language has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in Corsican affairs; earlier by those of the medieval Italian powers: Tuscany (828–1077), Pisa (1077–1282) and Genoa (1282–1768), more recently by France (1768–present), which, since 1789, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term \"gallicised Corsican\" refers to Corsican up to about the year 1950. The term \"distanciated Corsican\" refers to an idealized Corsican from which various agents have removed French or other elements.\n\nThe common relationship between Corsica and central Italy can be traced as far back as the Etruscans, who asserted their presence on the island in as early as 500 BC. In 40 AD, the natives of Corsica did not reportedly speak Latin. The Roman exile, Seneca the Younger, reports that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he did not understand (see the Ligurian hypothesis). Whatever language was spoken is still visible in the toponymy or in some words, for instance in the Gallurese dialect spoken in Sardinia \"zerru\" 'pig'. A similar situation is valid for Sardinian and Sicilian. The occupation of the island by the Vandals around the year 469 marked the end of authoritative influence by Latin speakers (see Medieval Corsica). If the natives of that time spoke Latin, they must have acquired it during the late empire. It has been theorised that a Sardinian variety might have been spoken in Corsica, prior to the island's Tuscanisation under Pisan and Genoese rule.\n\nThe two most widely spoken forms of the Corsican language are the groups spoken in the Bastia and Corte area (generally throughout the northern half of the island, known as Haute-Corse, \"Cismonte\" or \"Corsica suprana\"), and the groups spoken around Sartène and Porto-Vecchio (generally throughout the southern half of the island, known as Corse-du-Sud, \"Pumonti\" or \"Corsica suttana\"). The dialect of Ajaccio has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at Calvi and Bonifacio are closer to the Genoese dialect, also known as Ligurian.\n\nThis division along the Girolata-Porto Vecchio line was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the northern Corsican dialects became very close to a central Italian dialect like Tuscan, while the southern Corsican varieties could keep the original characteristics of the language which make it much more similar to Sicilian and, only to some extent, Sardinian.\n\nThe Northern Corsican macro variety (\"Supranacciu\", \"Supranu\", \"Cismuntincu\" or \"Cismontano\") is the most widespread on the island and standardised as well, and is spoken in North-West Corsica around the districts of Bastia and Corte. The dialect of Bastia and Cap Corse might be included among the Tuscan dialects, being they the closest form to standard Italian than any other Italo-Dalmatian dialects, with the exception of Florentine. All the dialects presenting, in addition to what has already been stated, the conditional tense as being formed by the blend of Infinitive and the Remote Past Tense of \"avè\" (e.g. \"ella amarebbe\" \"she would love\") are generally considered \"Cismontani\" dialects, situated north of a line uniting the villages of Piana, Vico, Vizzavona, Ghisoni and Ghisonaccia, and also covering the subgroups from the Cap Corse (which, unlike the rest of the island and similarly to Italian, uses \"lu\", \"li\", \"la\", \"le\" as definite articles), Bastia (besides i>e and a>e, u>o: \"ottanta\", \"momentu\", \"toccà\", \"continentale\"; a>o: \"oliva\", \"orechja\", \"ocellu\"), Balagna, Niolo and Corte (which retain the general Corsican traits: \"distinu\", \"ghjinnaghju\", \"sicondu\", \"billezza\", \"apartu\", \"farru\", \"marcuri\", \"cantaraghju\", \"uttanta\", \"mumentu\", \"tuccà\", \"cuntinentale\", \"aliva\", \"arechja\", \"acellu\").\n\nAcross the Northern and Southern borders of the line separating the Northern dialects from the Southern ones, there is a transitional area picking up linguistic phenomena associated to either of the two groups, with some local peculiarities. Along the Northern line, are the dialects around Piana and Calcatoggio, from Cinarca with Vizzavona (which form the conditional tense like in the South), and Fiumorbo through Ghisonaccia and Ghisoni, which present the retroflex sound \"ɖ\"; along the Southern line, one can spot the dialects of Ajaccio (having the cacuminal sound \"ɖ\" evolving from the \"ll\" nexus, the pronunciation of -\"ghj\"-, the feminine plurals ending in \"i\", some Northern words like \"cane\" and \"accattà\" instead of \"ghjacaru\" and \"cumprà\", as well as \"ellu\"/\"ella\" and not \"eddu\"/\"edda\"; minor variations: \"sabbatu\">\"sabbitu\", \"u li dà\">\"ghi lu dà\"; final syllable often stressed and truncated: \"marinari\">\"marinà\", \"panatteri\">\"panattè\", \"castellu\">\"castè\", \"cuchjari\">\"cuchjà\"), the Gravona area, Bastelica (which would be classified as Southern, but is also noted for its typical rhotacism: \"Basterga\") and Solenzara, which did not preserve the short Latin vowels: \"seccu\", \"peru\", \"rossu\", \"croci\", \"pozzu\").\n\nThe Southern Corsican macro variety (\"Suttanacciu\", \"Suttanu\", \"Pumontincu\" or \"Oltramontano\") is the most archaic and conservative group, spoken in the districts of Sartène and Porto-Vecchio. Unlike the Northern varieties and similarly to Sardinian, such group retains the distinction of the short Latin vowels \"ĭ\" e \"ŭ\" (e.g. \"pilu\", \"bucca\"). It is also strongly marked by the presence of the voiced retroflex stop, like Sicilian (e.g. \"aceddu\", \"beddu\", \"quiddu\", \"ziteddu\", \"famidda\"), and the conditional tense as being formed by the blend of Infinitive and the Imperfect Tense of \"avè\" (e.g. \"idda amarìa\" \"she would love\"). All the \"Oltramontani\" dialects are from an area located to the South of Porticcio, Bastelica, Col di Verde and Solenzara. Notable dialects are those from around Taravo (cacuminal -\"dd\"- only for the -\"ll\" nexus: \"frateddu\", \"suredda\", \"beddu\"; but preservation of the palatal lateral approximant: \"piglià\", \"famiglia\", \"figliolu\", \"vogliu\"; it does not preserve the short Latin vowels: \"seccu\", \"peru\", \"rossu\", \"croci\", \"pozzu\"), Sartène (preserving the short Latin vowels: \"siccu\", \"piru\", \"russu\", \"cruci\", \"puzzu\"; changing the \"rn\" nexus to \"rr\": \"forru\", \"carri\", \"corru\"; presenting the voiced retroflex stop in place of the palatal lateral approximant: \"piddà\", \"famidda\", \"fiddolu\", \"voddu\"; imperfect tense like \"cantàvami\", \"cantàvani\"; masculing plurals ending in \"a\": \"l'ochja\", \"i poma\"; having \"eddu/edda/eddi\" as personal pronouns), the Alta Rocca (the most conservative area in Corsica, being very close to the varieties spoken in Northern Sardinia), and the Southern region located between Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio's hinterlands (masculin singulars always ending in \"u\": \"fiumu\", \"paesu\", \"patronu\"; masculin plurals always ending in \"a\": \"i letta\", \"i solda\", \"i ponta\", \"i foca\", \"i mura\", \"i loca\", \"i balcona\"; imperfect tense like \"cantàiami\", \"cantàiani\").\n\nThe Gallurese variety is spoken in the extreme north of Sardinia, including the region of Gallura and the archipelago of La Maddalena, and Sassarese is spoken in Sassari and in its neighbourhood, in the northwest of Sardinia. Whether the two should be included either in Corsican or in Sardinian as dialects or considered independent languages is still subject of debate.\n\nOn Maddalena archipelago the local dialect (called \"Isulanu, Maddaleninu, Maddalenino\") was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio during immigration in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though influenced by Gallurese, it has maintained the original characteristics of Corsican. There are also numerous words of Genoese and Ponzese origin.\n\nOn October 14, 1997, Article 2 Item 4 of Law Number 26 of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia granted \"al dialetto sassarese e a quello gallurese\" – equal legal status with the other languages on Sardinia. They are thus legally defined as different languages from Sardinian by the Sardinian government.\nThe January 2007 estimated population of Corsica was 281,000, whereas the figure for the March 1999 census, when most of the studies—though not the linguistic survey work referenced in this article—were performed, was about 261,000 (see under Corsica). Only a fraction of the population at either time spoke Corsican with any fluency.\n\nThe use of Corsican language over French language has been declining. In 1980 about 70 percent of the population of the island \"had some command of the Corsican language.\" In 1990 out of a total population of about 254,000 the percentage had declined to 50 percent, with only 10 percent using it as a first language. (These figures do not count varieties of Corsican spoken in Sardinia.) The language appeared to be in serious decline when the French government reversed its unsupportive stand and initiated some strong measures to save it.\n\nAccording to an official survey run on behalf of the \"Collectivité territoriale de Corse\" which took place in April 2013, in Corsica the Corsican language has a number of speakers situated between 86,800 and 130,200, out of a total population amounting to 309,693 inhabitants. The percentage of those who have a solid knowledge of the language varies between a minimum of 25 percent in the 25-34 age group and the maximum of 65 percent in the over-65 age group: almost a quarter of the former age group does not understand Corsican, while only a small minority of the older people do not understand it. While 32 percent of the population of northern Corsica speaks Corsican quite well, this percentage drops to 22 percent for South Corsica. Moreover, 10 percent of the population of Corsica speaks only French, while 62 percent speak both French and Corsican. However, only 8 percent of the Corsicans know how to write correctly in Corsican, while about 60 percent of the population does not know how to write in Corsican. While 90 percent of the population is in favor of a Corsican-French bilingualism, 3 percent would like to have Corsican as the only official language in the island, and 7 percent would prefer French in this role.\n\nUNESCO classifies Corsican as a \"definitely endangered language.\" The Corsican language is a key vehicle for Corsican culture, which is notably rich in proverbs and in polyphonic song.\n\nWhen the French Assembly passed the Deixonne Law in 1951, which made it possible for regional languages to be taught at school, Alsatian, Flemish and Corsican were not included on the ground of being classified as \"dialectes allogènes\" of German, Dutch and Italian respectively; only in 1974 were they too politically recognized as regional languages for their teaching on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe 1991 \"Joxe Statute\", in setting up the Collectivité Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the Corsican Assembly, and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsican. The University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli at Corte, Haute-Corse took a central role in the planning.\n\nAt the primary school level Corsican is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level, but is required at the University of Corsica. It is available through adult education. It can be spoken in court or in the conduct of other government business if the officials concerned speak it. The Cultural Council of the Corsican Assembly advocates for its use, for example, on public signs.\n\nAccording to the anthropologist Dumenica Verdoni, writing new literature in modern Corsican, known as the \"Riacquistu\", is an integral part of affirming Corsican identity. Some individuals have returned from careers in continental France to write in Corsican, including Dumenicu Togniotti, director of the \"Teatru Paisanu\", which produced polyphonic musicals, 1973–1982, followed in 1980 by Michel Raffaelli's \"Teatru di a Testa Mora\", and Saveriu Valentini's \"Teatru Cupabbia\" in 1984. Modern prose writers include Alanu di Meglio, Ghjacumu Fusina, Lucia Santucci, and Marcu Biancarelli.\n\nThere were writers working in Corsican in the 1700s and 1800s\n\nFerdinand Gregorovius, 19th century traveller and enthusiast of Corsican culture, reported that the preferred form of the literary tradition of his time was the \"vocero\", a type of polyphonic ballad originating from funeral obsequies. These laments were similar in form to the chorales of Greek drama except that the leader could improvise. Some performers were noted at this, such as the 1700s Mariola della Piazzole and Clorinda Franseschi. However, the trail of written popular literature of known date in Corsican currently goes no further back than the 17th century. An undated corpus of proverbs from communes may well precede it (see under \"External links\" below). Corsican has also left a trail of legal documents ending in the late 12th century. At that time the monasteries held considerable land on Corsica and many of the churchmen were notaries.\n\nBetween 1200 and 1425 the monastery of Gorgona, which belonged to the Order of Saint Benedict for much of that time and was in the territory of Pisa, acquired about 40 legal papers of various sorts related to Corsica. As the church was replacing Pisan prelates with Corsican ones there, the legal language shows a transition from entirely Latin through partially Latin and partially Corsican to entirely Corsican. The first known surviving document containing some Corsican is a bill of sale from Patrimonio dated to 1220. These documents were moved to Pisa before the monastery closed its doors and were published there. Research into earlier evidence of Corsican is ongoing.\n\nCorsican is written in the standard Latin script, using 21 of the letters for native words. The letters j, k, w, x, and y are found only in foreign names and French vocabulary. The digraphs and trigraphs \"chj\", \"ghj\", \"sc\" and \"sg\" are also defined as \"letters\" of the alphabet in its modern scholarly form (compare the presence of \"ch\" or \"ll\" in the old Spanish alphabet) and appear respectively after \"c\", \"g\" and \"s\".\n\nThe primary diacritic used is the grave accent, indicating word stress when it is not penultimate. In scholarly contexts, disyllables may be distinguished from diphthongs by use of the diaeresis on the former vowel (as in Italian and distinct from French and English). In older writing, the acute accent is sometimes found on stressed , the circumflex on stressed , indicating respectively () and () phonemes.\n\nCorsican has been regarded as a dialect of Italian historically, similar to the Romance lects developed on the Italian peninsula, and in writing, it also resembles Italian (with the generalised substitution of -\"u\" for final -\"o\" and the articles \"u\" and \"a\" for \"il/lo\" and \"la\" respectively; however, both the dialect of Cap Corse and Gallurese retain the original articles \"lu\" and \"la\"). On the other hand, the phonemes of the modern Corsican dialects have undergone complex and sometimes irregular phenomena depending on phonological context, so the pronunciation of the language for foreigners familiar with other Romance languages is not straightforward.\n\nAs in Italian, the grapheme appears in some digraphs and trigraphs in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. is not pronounced between and : \"sciarpa\" ; or initially in some words: \"istu\" .\n\nVowels may be nasalized before (which is assimilated to before or ) and the palatal nasal consonant represented by . The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus , or . The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference. Example of nasal: is pronounced and not .\n\nThe Northern and central dialects in the vicinity of the Taravo river adopt the Italian seven-vowel system, whereas all the Southern ones around the so-called \"archaic zone\" with its centre being the town of Sartène (including the Gallurese dialect spoken in Northern Sardinia) resort to a five-vowel system without length differentiation, like Sardinian.\n\nThe vowel inventory, or collection of phonemic vowels (and the major allophones), transcribed in IPA symbols, is:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8240", "title": "Dada", "text": "Dada\n\nDada () or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century, with early centers in Zürich, Switzerland, at the Cabaret Voltaire (circa 1916); New York Dada began circa 1915, and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris. Developed in reaction to World War I, the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic, reason, and aestheticism of modern capitalist society, instead expressing nonsense, irrationality, and anti-bourgeois protest in their works. The art of the movement spanned visual, literary, and sound media, including collage, sound poetry, cut-up writing, and sculpture. Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence, war, and nationalism, and maintained political affinities with the radical left.\nThere is no consensus on the origin of the movement's name; a common story is that the German artist Richard Huelsenbeck slid a paper knife (letter-opener) at random into a dictionary, where it landed on \"dada\", a colloquial French term for a hobby horse. Others note that it suggests the first words of a child, evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group. Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning (or no meaning at all) in any language, reflecting the movement's internationalism.\n\nThe roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant-garde. The term anti-art, a precursor to Dada, was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works which challenge accepted definitions of art. Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention. The work of French poets, Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists would influence Dada's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning. Works such as \"Ubu Roi\" (1896) by Alfred Jarry, and the ballet \"Parade\" (1916–17) by Erik Satie would also be characterized as proto-Dadaist works. The Dada movement's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball's in 1916.\n\nThe Dadaist movement included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publication of art/literary journals; passionate coverage of art, politics, and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media. Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball, Marcel Duchamp, Emmy Hennings, Hans Arp, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Höch, Johannes Baader, Tristan Tzara, Francis Picabia, Huelsenbeck, George Grosz, John Heartfield, Man Ray, Beatrice Wood, Kurt Schwitters, Hans Richter, Max Ernst, and Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven among others. The movement influenced later styles like the avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including Surrealism, \"nouveau réalisme\", pop art and Fluxus.\n\nDada was an informal international movement, with participants in Europe and North America. The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I. For many participants, the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests, which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war, and against the cultural and intellectual conformity—in art and more broadly in society—that corresponded to the war.\n\nAvant-garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments. They had seen (or participated in) Cubist exhibitions held at Galeries Dalmau, Barcelona (1912), Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin (1912), the Armory Show in New York (1913), SVU Mánes in Prague (1914), several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring, Amsterdam (between 1911 and 1915). Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists. Dada subsequently combined these approaches.\n\nMany Dadaists believed that the 'reason' and 'logic' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war. They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality. For example, George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest \"against this world of mutual destruction.\"\n\nAccording to Hans Richter Dada was not art: it was \"anti-art.\" Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for. Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics, Dada ignored aesthetics. If art was to appeal to sensibilities, Dada was intended to offend.\n\nAs Hugo Ball expressed it, \"For us, art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in.\"\n\nA reviewer from the \"American Art News\" stated at the time that \"Dada philosophy is the sickest, most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man.\" Art historians have described Dada as being, in large part, a \"reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide.\"\n\nYears later, Dada artists described the movement as \"a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis, a savior, a monster, which would lay waste to everything in its path... [It was] a systematic work of destruction and demoralization... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege.\"\n\nTo quote Dona Budd's \"The Language of Art Knowledge\", Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words \"da, da,\" meaning \"yes, yes\" in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name \"Dada\" came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French–German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature, poetry, art manifestos, art theory, theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works.\n\nThe creations of Duchamp, Picabia, Man Ray, and others between 1915 and 1917 eluded the term Dada at the time, and \"New York Dada\" came to be seen as a post facto invention of Duchamp. At the outset of the 1920s the term Dada flourished in Europe with the help of Duchamp and Picabia, who had both returned from New York. Notwithstanding, Dadaists such as Tzara and Richter claimed European precedence. Art historian David Hopkins notes:\n\nIronically, though, Duchamp's late activities in New York, along with the machinations of Picabia, re-cast Dada's history. Dada's European chroniclers—primarily Richter, Tzara, and Huelsenbeck—would eventually become preoccupied with establishing the pre-eminence of Zurich and Berlin at the foundations of Dada, but it proved to be Duchamp who was most strategically brilliant in manipulating the genealogy of this avant-garde formation, deftly turning New York Dada from a late-comer into an originating force.\n\nIn 1916, Hugo Ball, Emmy Hennings, Tristan Tzara, Jean Arp, Marcel Janco, Richard Huelsenbeck, Sophie Taeuber, and Hans Richter, along with others, discussed art and put on performances in the Cabaret Voltaire expressing their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it.\n\nSome sources state that Dada coalesced on October 6 at the Cabaret Voltaire. Other sources state that Dada did not originate fully in a Zürich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe, particularly Romania, that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish modernist artists (Tzara, Janco, Arthur Segal, and others) settled in Zürich. In the years prior to the First World War similar art had already risen in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities; it is likely that Dada's catalyst was the arrival in Zürich of artists like Tzara and Janco.\n\nHaving left Germany and Romania during the Great War, the artists found themselves in Switzerland, a country recognized for its neutrality. Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction to fight against the social, political, and cultural ideas of that time. The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society, a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the \"status quo\".\n\nJanco recalled, \"We had lost confidence in our culture. Everything had to be demolished. We would begin again after the \"tabula rasa\". At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense, public opinion, education, institutions, museums, good taste, in short, the whole prevailing order.\" \n\nThe Cabaret closed its doors in early July and then at the first public soirée at Waag Hall on July 14, 1916, Ball recited the . In 1917, Tzara wrote a second considered one of the most important Dada writings, which was published in 1918. Other manifestos followed.\n\nA single issue of the magazine \"Cabaret Voltaire\" was the first publication to come out of the movement.\n\nAfter the cabaret closed down, Dada activities moved on to a new gallery, and Hugo Ball left for Bern. Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas. He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters, and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist. The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened, and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf.\n\nZürich Dada, with Tzara at the helm, published the art and literature review \"Dada\" beginning in July 1917, with five editions from Zürich and the final two from Paris.\n\nOther artists, such as André Breton and Philippe Soupault, created “literature groups to help extend the influence of Dada.”\n\nAfter the fighting of the First World War had ended in the armistice of November 1918, most of the Zürich Dadaists returned to their home countries, and some began Dada activities in other cities. Others, such as the Swiss native Sophie Taeuber, would remain in Zürich into the 1920s.\n\n\"Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers, of mounting, thundering hunger, where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust, and men's minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence... Fear was in everybody's bones \"- Richard Hülsenbeck\n\nThe groups in Germany were not as strongly anti-art as other groups. Their activity and art were more political and social, with corrosive manifestos and propaganda, satire, public demonstrations and overt political activities. The intensely political and war-torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists. Conversely, New York's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically-driven, less political nature.\n\nIn February 1918, while the Great War was approaching its climax, Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin, and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year. Following the October Revolution in Russia, by then out of the war, Hannah Höch and George Grosz used Dada to express communist sympathies. Grosz, together with John Heartfield, Höch and Hausmann developed the technique of photomontage during this period.\n\nAfter the war, the artists published a series of short-lived political magazines and held the \"First International Dada Fair\", 'the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists', in the summer of 1920. As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada – Grosz, Raoul Hausmann, Hannah Höch, Johannes Baader, Huelsenbeck and Heartfield – the exhibition also included the work of Otto Dix, Francis Picabia, Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Rudolf Schlichter, Johannes Baargeld and others. In all, over 200 works were exhibited, surrounded by incendiary slogans, some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi's \"Entartete Kunst\" exhibition in 1937. Despite high ticket prices, the exhibition lost money, with only one recorded sale.\n\nThe Berlin group published periodicals such as \"Club Dada\", \"Der Dada\", \"Everyman His Own Football\", and \"Dada Almanach\".\n\nIn Cologne, Ernst, Baargeld, and Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments. Cologne's Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub, and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a communion dress. The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity, but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped.\n\nLike Zürich, New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War. Soon after arriving from France in 1915, Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia met American artist Man Ray. By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical anti-art activities in the United States. American Beatrice Wood, who had been studying in France, soon joined them, along with Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. Arthur Cravan, fleeing conscription in France, was also in New York for a time. Much of their activity centered in Alfred Stieglitz's gallery, 291, and the home of Walter and Louise Arensberg.\n\nThe New Yorkers, though not particularly organized, called their activities \"Dada,\" but they did not issue manifestos. They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as \"The Blind Man\", \"Rongwrong\", and \"New York Dada\" in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for \"museum\" art. New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor. In his book \"Adventures in the arts: informal chapters on painters, vaudeville and poets\" Marsden Hartley included an essay on \"\".\nDuring this time Duchamp began exhibiting \"readymades\" (everyday objects found or purchased and declared art) such as a bottle rack, and was active in the Society of Independent Artists. In 1917 he submitted the now famous \"Fountain\", a urinal signed R. Mutt, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece. First an object of scorn within the arts community, the \"Fountain\" has since become almost canonized by some as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture. Art world experts polled by the sponsors of the 2004 Turner Prize, Gordon's gin, voted it \"the most influential work of modern art\". As recent scholarship documents, the work is still controversial. Duchamp indicated in a 1917 letter to his sister that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work: \"One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture.\" The piece is in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp's neighbour, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. In an attempt to \"pay homage to the spirit of Dada\" a performance artist named Pierre Pinoncelli made a crack in a replica of \"The Fountain\" with a hammer in January 2006; he also urinated on it in 1993.\n\nPicabia's travels tied New York, Zürich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period. For seven years he also published the Dada periodical \"391\" in Barcelona, New York City, Zürich, and Paris from 1917 through 1924.\n\nBy 1921, most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation.\n\nThe French avant-garde kept abreast of Dada activities in Zürich with regular communications from Tristan Tzara (whose pseudonym means \"sad in country,\" a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania), who exchanged letters, poems, and magazines with Guillaume Apollinaire, André Breton, Max Jacob, Clément Pansaers, and other French writers, critics and artists.\n\nParis had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century. One of its practitioners, Erik Satie, collaborated with Picasso and Cocteau in a mad, scandalous ballet called \"Parade\". First performed by the Ballets Russes in 1917, it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky's \"Le Sacre du printemps\" had done almost five years earlier. This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself, something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with.\n\nDada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there. Inspired by Tzara, Paris Dada soon issued manifestos, organized demonstrations, staged performances and produced a number of journals (the final two editions of \"Dada\", \"Le Cannibale\", and \"Littérature\" featured Dada in several editions.)\n\nThe first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the \"Salon des Indépendants\" in 1921. Jean Crotti exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled, \"Explicatif\" bearing the word \"Tabu\". In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play \"The Gas Heart\" to howls of derision from the audience. When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production, the play provoked a theatre riot (initiated by André Breton) that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce Surrealism. Tzara's last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his \"ironic tragedy\" \"Handkerchief of Clouds\" in 1924.\n\nIn the Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around Theo van Doesburg, best known for establishing the De Stijl movement and magazine of the same name. Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry, and included poems from many well-known Dada writers in \"De Stijl\" such as Hugo Ball, Hans Arp and Kurt Schwitters. Van Doesburg and (a cordwainer and artist in Drachten) became friends of Schwitters, and together they organized the so-called \"Dutch Dada campaign\" in 1923, where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada (entitled \"What is Dada?\"), Schwitters read his poems, Vilmos Huszár demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg (Theo's wife), played avant-garde compositions on piano.\nVan Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in \"De Stijl\", although under a pseudonym, I.K. Bonset, which was only revealed after his death in 1931. 'Together' with I.K. Bonset, he also published a short-lived Dutch Dada magazine called \"Mécano\" (1922–3). Another Dutchman identified by K. Schippers in his study of the movement in the Netherlands was the Groningen typographer H. N. Werkman, who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine, \"The Next Call\" (1923–6). Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German-born and eventually settled in the Netherlands. These were Otto van Rees, who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Café Voltaire in Zürich, and Paul Citroen.\n\nAlthough Dada itself was unknown in Georgia until at least 1920, from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves \"41st Degree\" (referring both to the latitude of Tbilisi, Georgia and to the temperature of a high fever) organized along Dadaist lines. The most important figure in this group was Iliazd, whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists. After his flight to Paris in 1921, he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events.\n\nIn Yugoslavia there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922, run mainly by Dragan Aleksić and including work by Mihailo S. Petrov, Zenitism's two brothers Ljubomir Micić and Branko Ve Poljanski. Aleksić used the term \"Yougo-Dada\" and is known to have been in contact with Raoul Hausmann, Kurt Schwitters, and Tristan Tzara.\n\nThe Dada movement in Italy, based in Mantua, was met with distaste and failed to make a significant impact in the world of art. It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome, featuring paintings, quotations from Tristan Tzara, and original epigrams such as \"True Dada is against Dada\". The most notable member of this group was Julius Evola, who went on to become an eminent scholar of occultism, as well as a right-wing philosopher and an assistant to Benito Mussolini.\n\nA prominent Dada group in Japan was Mavo, founded in July 1923 by Tomoyoshi Murayama and . Other prominent artists were Jun Tsuji, Eisuke Yoshiyuki, Shinkichi Takahashi and Katsue Kitasono.\n\nIn the Tsuburaya Productions's \"Ultra Series\", an alien named Dada was designed after the Dadaism movement, with said character first appearing in episode 28 of the 1966 tokusatsu series, \"Ultraman\", and was designed by character artist Toru Narita. Dada's design is primarily monochromatic, and features numerous sharp lines and alternating black and white stripes, as a reference to the movement. On May 19, 2016, in celebration to the 100 year anniversary of Dadaism in Tokyo, the Ultra Monster was invited to meet the Swiss Ambassador Urs Bucher.\n\nDada in itself was relatively unknown in Russia, however, avant-garde art was widespread due to the Bolshevik's revolutionary agenda. The , a literary group sharing Dadaist ideals achieved infamy after one of its members suggested that Vladimir Mayakovsky should go to the \"Pampushka\" (Pameatnik Pushkina – Pushkin monument) on the \"Tverbul\" (Tverskoy Boulevard) to clean the shoes of anyone who desired it, after Mayakovsky declared that he was going to cleanse Russian literature.\n\nIn literature, Dadaism focused mainly on poetry, particularly the so-called sound poetry, which was invented by Hugo Ball and often performed on stage. The Dadaist poem is described as one that abolishes the traditional concept of poetry, including the structure, order, as well as the interplay of sound and meaning or the meaning of language itself. The belief is that the existing system by which information is articulated is said to rob language of its dignity. \n\nTherefore, the dismantling of the language and the poetic conventions are considered attempts to restore language to its purest and most innocent form. \"With these sound poem, we wanted to dispense with a language which journalism had made desolate and impossible.\" One of the offshoots of this type of poetry was the simultaneous poems, which were recited by a group of speakers, who collectively produce a chaotic and confusing set of voices. The poems are considered manifestations of modern society such as advertising, technology, and conflict, among others. However, unlike movements such as expressionism, Dadaism appreciated the dynamics of modernity and the urban life. The poetry produced by this genre does not consider the chaotic urban and futuristic world as negative, man-eating or hellish. Instead, there is a focus on how these serve as new natural terrain that opens up new ideas for life and art. \n\nDadaism also blurred the line between the literary and visual arts. One of the Dadaist techniques, for instance, proposed the use of physical materials alongside words so that the newly created poem became a fruit of the written idea and the physical artifacts such as newspapers. Marc Lowenthal, in \"I Am a Beautiful Monster: Poetry, Prose, and Provocation\", writes:Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry, a starting point for performance art, a prelude to postmodernism, an influence on pop art, a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho-political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for Surrealism.Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts; its influence reached into sound and music. Kurt Schwitters developed what he called \"sound poems\", while Francis Picabia and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920. Other composers such as Erwin Schulhoff, Hans Heusser and Alberto Savinio all wrote \"Dada music\", while members of Les Six collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings. Erik Satie also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career, although he is primarily associated with musical Impressionism.\n\nIn the very first Dada publication, Hugo Ball describes a \"balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk-songs.\" African music and jazz were common at Dada gatherings.\n\nMusician Frank Zappa was a self-proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement:In the early days, I didn't even know what to call the stuff my life was made of. You can imagine my delight when I discovered that someone in a distant land had the same idea—AND a nice, short name for it.\n\nWhile broadly based, the movement was unstable. By 1924 in Paris, Dada was melding into Surrealism, and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements, including Surrealism, social realism and other forms of modernism. Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of postmodern art.\n\nBy the dawn of the Second World War, many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States. Some (Otto Freundlich, Walter Serner) died in death camps under Adolf Hitler, who actively persecuted the kind of \"degenerate art\" that he considered Dada to represent. The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature.\n\nDada is a named influence and reference of various anti-art and political and cultural movements, including the Situationist International and culture jamming groups like the Cacophony Society. Upon breaking up in July 2012, anarchist pop band Chumbawamba issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement.\n\nAt the same time that the Zürich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the Cabaret Voltaire, Lenin was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment. Tom Stoppard used this coincidence as a premise for his play \"Travesties\" (1974), which includes Tzara, Lenin, and James Joyce as characters. French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue-in-cheek \"Lénine Dada\" (1989).\n\nThe former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002, by a group proclaiming themselves Neo-Dadaists, led by Mark Divo. The group included Jan Thieler, Ingo Giezendanner, Aiana Calugar, Lennie Lee, and Dan Jones. After their eviction, the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada. The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum.\n\nSeveral notable retrospectives have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society. In 1967, a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris. In 2006, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. The LTM label has released a large number of Dada-related sound recordings, including interviews with artists such as Tzara, Picabia, Schwitters, Arp, and Huelsenbeck, and musical repertoire including Satie, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Picabia, and Nelly van Doesburg.\n\nThe Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items, but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets, maps, plastic wrappers, etc. to portray aspects of life, rather than representing objects viewed as still life.\n\nCut-up technique is an extension of collage to words themselves, Tristan Tzara describes this in the Dada Manifesto:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">\nTO MAKE A DADAIST POEM\nTake a newspaper.\nTake some scissors.\nChoose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem.\nCut out the article.\nNext carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag.\nShake gently.\nNext take out each cutting one after the other.\nCopy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.\nThe poem will resemble you.\nAnd there you are – an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.\n</poem>\n\nThe Dadaists – the \"monteurs\" (mechanics) – used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media. A variation on the collage technique, photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press. In Cologne, Max Ernst used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war.\nThe assemblages were three-dimensional variations of the collage – the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless (relative to the war) pieces of work including war objects and trash. Objects were nailed, screwed or fastened together in different fashions. Assemblages could be seen in the round or could be hung on a wall.\n\nMarcel Duchamp began to view the manufactured objects of his collection as objects of art, which he called \"readymades\". He would add signatures and titles to some, converting them into artwork that he called \"readymade aided\" or \"rectified readymades\". Duchamp wrote: \"One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the 'readymade.' That sentence, instead of describing the object like a title, was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal. Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations, would be called 'readymade aided.'\" One such example of Duchamp's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back, signed \"R. Mutt\", titled \"Fountain\", and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year, though it was not displayed.\n\n\n\nManifestos\n"}
{"id": "25544562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25544562", "title": "Dominion", "text": "Dominion\n\nDominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \"autonomous within the British Empire\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster confirmed their full legislative independence.\n\nEarlier usage of \"dominion\" to refer to a particular territory dates to the 16th century and was used to describe Wales from 1535 to 1801 and New England between 1686 and 1689.\n\nA distinction must be made between a British \"dominion\" and British \"Dominions\". The use of a capital \"D\" when referring to the 'British Dominions' was required by the United Kingdom government in order to avoid confusion with the wider term \"His Majesty's dominions\" which referred to the British Empire as a whole.\n\nAll territories forming part of the British Empire were British dominions but only some were British Dominions. At the time of the adoption of the Statute of Westminster, there were six British Dominions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, and the Irish Free State. At the same time there were many other jurisdictions that were British dominions, for example Cyprus. The Order in Council annexing the island of Cyprus in 1914 declared that, from 5 November, the island \"shall be annexed to and form part of His Majesty's dominions\".\n\nUse of \"dominion\" to refer to a particular territory dates back to the 16th century and was sometimes used to describe Wales from 1535 to around 1800: for instance, the Laws in Wales Act 1535 applies to \"the Dominion, Principality and Country of Wales\". \"Dominion\", as an official title, was conferred on the Colony of Virginia about 1660 and on the Dominion of New England in 1686. These dominions never had full self-governing status. The creation of the short-lived Dominion of New England was designed—contrary to the purpose of later dominions—to increase royal control and to reduce the colony's self-government.\n\nUnder the British North America Act 1867, Canada received the status of \"Dominion\" upon the Confederation of several British possessions in North America. However, it was at the Colonial Conference of 1907 when the self-governing colonies of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia were referred to collectively as \"Dominions\" for the first time. Two other self-governing colonies—New Zealand and Newfoundland—were granted the status of Dominion in the same year. These were followed by the Union of South Africa in 1910 and the Irish Free State in 1922. At the time of the founding of the League of Nations in 1924, the League Covenant made provision for the admission of any \"fully self-governing state, Dominion, or Colony\", the implication being that \"Dominion status was something between that of a colony and a state\".\n\nDominion status was formally defined in the Balfour Declaration of 1926, which recognised these countries as \"autonomous within the British Empire\", thus acknowledging them as political equals of the United Kingdom. The Statute of Westminster 1931 converted this status into legal reality, making them essentially independent members of what was then called the \"British Commonwealth\".\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the decline of British colonialism led to Dominions generally being referred to as Commonwealth realms and the use of the word \"dominion\" gradually diminished. Nonetheless, though disused, it remains Canada's legal title and the phrase \"Her Majesty's Dominions\" is still used occasionally in legal documents in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe phrase \"His/Her Majesty's dominions\" is a legal and constitutional phrase that refers to all the realms and territories of the Sovereign, whether independent or not. Thus, for example, the British \"Ireland Act, 1949\", recognised that the Republic of Ireland had \"ceased to be part of His Majesty's dominions\". When dependent territories that had never been annexed (that is, were not colonies of the Crown, but were League of Nations mandates, protectorates or United Nations Trust Territories) were granted independence, the United Kingdom act granting independence always declared that such and such a territory \"shall form part of Her Majesty's dominions\", and so become part of the territory in which the Queen exercises sovereignty, not merely suzerainty. The later sense of \"Dominion\" was capitalised to distinguish it from the more general sense of \"dominion\".\n\nThe word \"dominions\" originally referred to the possessions of the Kingdom of England. Oliver Cromwell's full title in the 1650s was \"Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, and the dominions thereto belonging\". In 1660, King Charles II gave the Colony of Virginia the title of \"dominion\" in gratitude for Virginia's loyalty to the Crown during the English Civil War. The Commonwealth of Virginia, a State of the United States, still has \"the Old Dominion\" as one of its nicknames. \"Dominion\" also occurred in the name of the short-lived Dominion of New England (1686–1689). In all of these cases, the word \"dominion\" implied no more than being subject to the English Crown.\n\nThe foundation of \"Dominion\" status followed the achievement of internal self-rule in British Colonies, in the specific form of full responsible government (as distinct from \"representative government\"). Colonial responsible government began to emerge during the mid-19th century. The legislatures of Colonies with responsible government were able to make laws in all matters other than foreign affairs, defence and international trade, these being powers which remained with the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Bermuda, notably, was never defined as a Dominion, despite meeting this criteria, but as a \"self-governing colony\" that remains part of the British Realm.\n\nNova Scotia soon followed by the Province of Canada (which included modern southern Ontario and southern Quebec) were the first Colonies to achieve responsible government, in 1848. Prince Edward Island followed in 1851, and New Brunswick and Newfoundland in 1855. All except for Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island agreed to form a new federation named Canada from 1867. This was instituted by the British Parliament in the \"British North America Act 1867\". \"(See also: Canadian Confederation).\" Section 3 of the Act referred to the new entity as a \"Dominion\", the first such entity to be created. From 1870 the Dominion included two vast neighbouring British territories that did not have any form of self-government: Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, parts of which later became the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the separate territories, the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut. In 1871, the Crown Colony of British Columbia became a Canadian province, Prince Edward Island joined in 1873 and Newfoundland in 1949.\n\nThe conditions under which the four separate Australian colonies—New South Wales, Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia—and New Zealand could gain full responsible government were set out by the British government in the \"Australian Constitutions Act 1850\". The Act also separated the Colony of Victoria (in 1851) from New South Wales. During 1856, responsible government was achieved by New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, and New Zealand. The remainder of New South Wales was divided in three in 1859, a change that established most of the present borders of NSW; the Colony of Queensland, with its own responsible self-government, and the Northern Territory (which was not granted self-government prior to federation of the Australian Colonies). Western Australia did not receive self-government until 1891, mainly because of its continuing financial dependence on the UK Government. After protracted negotiations (that initially included New Zealand), six Australian colonies with responsible government (and their dependent territories) agreed to federate, along Canadian lines, becoming the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901.\n\nIn South Africa, the Cape Colony became the first British self-governing Colony, in 1872. (Until 1893, the Cape Colony also controlled the separate Colony of Natal.) Following the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the British Empire assumed direct control of the Boer Republics, but transferred limited self-government to Transvaal in 1906, and the Orange River Colony in 1907.\nThe Commonwealth of Australia was recognised as a Dominion in 1901, and the Dominion of New Zealand and the Dominion of Newfoundland were officially given Dominion status in 1907, followed by the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn connection with proposals for the future government of British North America, use of the term \"Dominion\" was suggested by Samuel Leonard Tilley at the London Conference of 1866 discussing the confederation of the Province of Canada (subsequently becoming the Province of Ontario and the Province of Quebec), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into \"One Dominion under the Name of Canada\", the first federation internal to the British Empire. Tilley's suggestion was taken from the 72nd Psalm, verse eight, \"He shall have \"dominion\" also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth\", which is echoed in the national motto, \"A Mari Usque Ad Mare\". The new government of Canada under the British North America Act of 1867 began to use the phrase \"Dominion of Canada\" to designate the new, larger nation. However, neither the Confederation nor the adoption of the title of \"Dominion\" granted extra autonomy or new powers to this new federal level of government. Senator Eugene Forsey wrote that the powers acquired since the 1840s that established the system of responsible government in Canada would simply be transferred to the new Dominion government:\nThe constitutional scholar Andrew Heard has established that Confederation did not legally change Canada's colonial status to anything approaching its later status of a Dominion.\nHeard went on to document the sizeable body of legislation passed by the British Parliament in the latter part of the 19th century that upheld and expanded its Imperial supremacy to constrain that of its colonies, including the new Dominion government in Canada.\nFor decades, none of the Dominions were allowed to have its own embassies or consulates in foreign countries. All matters concerning international travel, commerce, etc., had to be transacted through British embassies and consulates. For example, all transactions concerning visas and lost or stolen passports by citizens of the Dominions were carried out at British diplomatic offices. It was not until the late 1930s and early 1940s that the Dominion governments were allowed to establish their own embassies, and the first two of these that were established by the Dominion governments in Ottawa and in Canberra were both established in Washington, D.C., in the United States.\n\nAs Heard later explained, the British government seldom invoked its powers over Canadian legislation. British legislative powers over Canadian domestic policy were largely theoretical and their exercise was increasingly unacceptable in the 1870s and 1880s. The rise to the status of a Dominion and then full independence for Canada and other possessions of the British Empire did not occur by the granting of titles or similar recognition by the British Parliament but by initiatives taken by the new governments of certain former British dependencies to assert their independence and to establish constitutional precedents.\nWhat was significant about the creation of the Canadian and Australian federations was not that they were instantly granted wide new powers by the Imperial centre at the time of their creation; but that they, because of their greater size and prestige, were better able to exercise their existing powers and lobby for new ones than the various colonies they incorporated could have done separately. They provided a new model which politicians in New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, Ireland, India, Malaysia could point to for their own relationship with Britain. Ultimately, \"[Canada's] example of a peaceful accession to independence with a Westminster system of government came to be followed by 50 countries with a combined population of more than 2-billion people.\"\n\nIssues of colonial self-government spilled into foreign affairs with the Boer War (1899–1902). The self-governing colonies contributed significantly to British efforts to stem the insurrection, but ensured that they set the conditions for participation in these wars. Colonial governments repeatedly acted to ensure that they determined the extent of their peoples' participation in imperial wars in the military build-up to the First World War.\n\nThe assertiveness of the self-governing colonies was recognised in the Colonial Conference of 1907, which implicitly introduced the idea of the Dominion as a self-governing colony by referring to Canada and Australia as Dominions. It also retired the name \"Colonial Conference\" and mandated that meetings take place regularly to consult Dominions in running the foreign affairs of the empire.\n\nThe Colony of New Zealand, which chose not to take part in Australian federation, became the Dominion of New Zealand on 26 September 1907; Newfoundland became a Dominion on the same day. The Union of South Africa was referred to as a Dominion upon its creation in 1910.\n\nThe initiatives and contributions of British colonies to the British war effort in the First World War were recognised by Britain with the creation of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917, which gave them a say in the running of the war. Dominion status as self-governing states, as opposed to symbolic titles granted various British colonies, waited until 1919, when the self-governing Dominions signed the Treaty of Versailles independently of the British government and became individual members of the League of Nations. This ended the purely colonial status of the Dominions.\n\nThe First World War ended the purely colonial period in the history of the Dominions. Their military contribution to the Allied war effort gave them claim to equal recognition with other small states and a voice in the formation of policy. This claim was recognised within the Empire by the creation of the Imperial War Cabinet in 1917, and within the community of nations by Dominion signatures to the Treaty of Versailles and by separate Dominion representation in the League of Nations. In this way the \"self-governing Dominions\", as they were called, emerged as junior members of the international community. Their status defied exact analysis by both international and constitutional lawyers, but it was clear that they were no longer regarded simply as colonies of Britain.\n\nThe Irish Free State, set up in 1922 after the Anglo-Irish War, was the first Dominion to appoint a non-British, non-aristocratic Governor-General when Timothy Michael Healy took the position in 1922. Dominion status was never popular in the Irish Free State where people saw it as a face-saving measure for a British government unable to countenance a republic in what had previously been the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Successive Irish governments undermined the constitutional links with Britain until they were severed completely in 1949. In 1937 Ireland adopted, almost simultaneously, both a new constitution that included powers for a president of Ireland and a law confirming a role for the king in external relations.\n\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1926, and the subsequent Statute of Westminster, 1931, restricted Britain's ability to pass or affect laws outside of its own jurisdiction. Significantly, Britain initiated the change to complete sovereignty for the Dominions. The First World War left Britain saddled with enormous debts, and the Great Depression had further reduced Britain's ability to pay for defence of its empire. In spite of popular opinions of empires, the larger Dominions were reluctant to leave the protection of the then-superpower. For example, many Canadians felt that being part of the British Empire was the only thing that had prevented them from being absorbed into the United States.\n\nUntil 1931, Newfoundland was referred to as a colony of the United Kingdom, as for example, in the 1927 reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to delineate the Quebec-Labrador boundary. Full autonomy was granted by the United Kingdom parliament with the Statute of Westminster in December 1931. However, the government of Newfoundland \"requested the United Kingdom not to have sections 2 to 6[—]confirming Dominion status[—]apply automatically to it[,] until the Newfoundland Legislature first approved the Statute, approval which the Legislature subsequently never gave\". In any event, Newfoundland's letters patent of 1934 suspended self-government and instituted a \"Commission of Government\", which continued until Newfoundland became a province of Canada in 1949. It is the view of some constitutional lawyers that—although Newfoundland chose not to exercise all of the functions of a Dominion like Canada—its status as a Dominion was \"suspended\" in 1934, rather than \"revoked\" or \"abolished\".\n\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand, the Irish Free State, Newfoundland and South Africa (prior to becoming a republic and leaving the Commonwealth in 1961), with their large populations of European descent, were sometimes collectively referred to as the \"White Dominions\". Today Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are sometimes referred to collectively as the \"White Commonwealth\".\n\nFour colonies of Australia had enjoyed responsible government since 1856: New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. Queensland had responsible government soon after its founding in 1859 but, because of ongoing financial dependence on Britain, Western Australia became the last Australian colony to attain self-government in 1890. During the 1890s, the colonies voted to unite and in 1901 they were federated under the British Crown as the Commonwealth of Australia by the \"Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\". The Constitution of Australia had been drafted in Australia and approved by popular consent. Thus Australia is one of the few countries established by a popular vote. Under the Balfour Declaration of 1926, the federal government was regarded as coequal with (and not subordinate to) the British and other Dominion governments, and this was given formal legal recognition in 1942 (when the \"Statute of Westminster\" was retroactively adopted to the commencement of the Second World War 1939). In 1930, the Australian prime minister, James Scullin, reinforced the right of the overseas Dominions to appoint native-born governors-general, when he advised King George V to appoint Sir Isaac Isaacs as his representative in Australia, against the wishes of the opposition and officials in London. The governments of the States (called colonies before 1901) remained under the Commonwealth but retained links to the UK until the passage of the \"Australia Act 1986\".\n\nThe term \"Dominion\" is employed in the Constitution Act, 1867 (originally the British North America Act, 1867), and describes the resulting political union. Specifically, the preamble of the act states: \"Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom...\" Furthermore, Sections 3 and 4 indicate that the provinces \"shall form and be One Dominion under the Name of Canada; and on and after that Day those Three Provinces shall form and be One Dominion under that Name accordingly\".\n\nUsage of the phrase \"Dominion of Canada\" was employed as the country's name after 1867, predating the general use of the term \"Dominion\" as applied to the other autonomous regions of the British Empire after 1907. The phrase \"Dominion of Canada\" does not appear in the 1867 act nor in the Constitution Act, 1982, but does appear in the Constitution Act, 1871, other contemporaneous texts, and subsequent bills. References to the \"Dominion of Canada\" in later acts, such as the Statute of Westminster, do not clarify the point because all nouns were formally capitalised in British legislative style. Indeed, in the original text of the Constitution Act, 1867, \"One\" and \"Name\" were also capitalised.\n\nFrank Scott theorised that Canada's status as a Dominion ended when Canadian parliament declared war on Germany on 9 September 1939, separately and distinctly from the United Kingdom's declaration of war six days earlier. From the 1950s, the federal government began to phase out the use of \"Dominion\", which had been used largely as a synonym of \"federal\" or \"national\" such as \"Dominion building\" for a post office, \"Dominion-provincial relations\", and so on. The last major change was renaming the national holiday from Dominion Day to Canada Day in 1982. Official bilingualism laws also contributed to the disuse of \"Dominion\", as it has no acceptable equivalent in French.\n\nWhile the term may be found in older official documents, and the Dominion Carillonneur still tolls at Parliament Hill, it is now hardly used to distinguish the federal government from the provinces or (historically) Canada before and after 1867. Nonetheless, the federal government continues to produce publications and educational materials that specify the currency of these official titles.\n\nDefenders of the title \"Dominion\"—including monarchists who see signs of creeping republicanism in Canada—take comfort in the fact that the Constitution Act, 1982 does not mention and therefore does not remove the title, and that a constitutional amendment is required to change it.\n\nThe word \"Dominion\" has been used with other agencies, laws, and roles:\n\n\nNotable Canadian corporations and organizations (not affiliated with government) that have used \"Dominion\" as a part of their name have included:\n\n\nCeylon, which, as a Crown colony, was originally promised \"fully responsible status within the British Commonwealth of Nations\", was formally granted independence as a Dominion in 1948. In 1972 it adopted a republican constitution to become the Free, Sovereign and Independent Republic of Sri Lanka. By a new constitution in 1978, it became the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\n\nBritish India acquired a partially representative government in 1909, and the first Parliament was introduced in 1919. Discussions on the further devolution of power, and granting of Dominion status, continued through the 1920s, with The Commonwealth of India Bill 1925, Simon Commission 1927-1930, and Nehru Report 1928 being often cited proposals. Further powers were eventually devolved, following the 1930-32 Round Table Conferences (India), to the locally elected legislatures, via the Government of India Act, 1935. The Cripps Mission of 1942 proposed the further devolution of powers, within Dominion status, to the Political leadership of British India. Cripps's plan was rejected and full independence was sought.\nPakistan (including Muslim-majority East Bengal forming East Pakistan) seceded from India at the point of Indian Independence with the passage of the Indian Independence Act 1947 and ensuing partition, resulting in two dominions. For India, dominion status was transitory until its new republican constitution was drafted and promulgated in 1950. Pakistan remained a dominion until 1956 when it became an Islamic Republic under its 1956 constitution. East Pakistan gained independence from Pakistan, as Bangladesh, in 1971.\n\nThe Irish Free State (Ireland from 1937) was a British Dominion between 1922 and 1949. As established by the Irish Free State Constitution Act of the United Kingdom Parliament on 6 December 1922 the new state—which had Dominion status in the likeness of that enjoyed by Canada within the British Commonwealth of Nations—comprised the whole of Ireland. However, provision was made in the Act for the Parliament of Northern Ireland to opt out of inclusion in the Irish Free State, which—as had been widely expected at the time—it duly did one day after the creation of the new state, on 7 December 1922.\n\nFollowing a plebiscite of the people of the Free State held on 1 July 1937, a new constitution came into force on 29 December of that year, establishing a successor state with the name of \"Ireland\" which ceased to participate in Commonwealth conferences and events. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom and other member states of the Commonwealth continued to regard Ireland as a Dominion owing to the unusual role accorded to the British Monarch under the Irish External Relations Act of 1936. Ultimately, however, Ireland's Oireachtas passed the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949 and unequivocally ended Ireland's links with the British Monarch and the Commonwealth.\n\nThe colony of Newfoundland enjoyed responsible government from 1855 to 1934. It was among the colonies declared Dominions in 1907. Following the recommendations of a Royal Commission, parliamentary government was suspended in 1934 due to severe financial difficulties resulting from the depression and a series of riots against the Dominion government in 1932. In 1949, it joined Canada and the legislature was restored.\n\nThe New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 gave New Zealand its own Parliament (General Assembly) and home rule in 1852. In 1907 New Zealand was proclaimed the Dominion of New Zealand. New Zealand, Canada, and Newfoundland used the word Dominion in the official title of the nation, whereas Australia used Commonwealth of Australia and South Africa Union of South Africa. New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster in 1947 and in the same year legislation passed in London gave New Zealand full powers to amend its own constitution. In 1986, the New Zealand parliament passed the Constitution Act 1986, which repealed the Constitution Act of 1852 and the last constitutional links with the United Kingdom, formally ending its Dominion status.\n\nThe Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 from the four self-governing colonies of the Cape Colony, Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State (the last two were former Boer republics). The South Africa Act 1909 provided for a Parliament consisting of a Senate and a House of Assembly. The provinces had their own legislatures. In 1961, the Union of South Africa adopted a new constitution, became a republic, left the Commonwealth (and re-joined following end of Apartheid rule in the 1990s), and became the present-day Republic of South Africa.\n\nSouthern Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980) was a special case in the British Empire. Although it was never a Dominion, it was treated as a Dominion in many respects. Southern Rhodesia was formed in 1923 out of territories of the British South Africa Company and established as a self-governing colony with substantial autonomy on the model of the Dominions. The imperial authorities in London retained direct powers over foreign affairs, constitutional alterations, native administration and bills regarding mining revenues, railways and the governor's salary.\n\nSouthern Rhodesia was not one of the territories that were mentioned in the 1931 Statute of Westminster although relations with Southern Rhodesia were administered in London through the Dominion Office, not the Colonial Office. When the Dominions were first treated as foreign countries by London for the purposes of diplomatic immunity in 1952, Southern Rhodesia was included in the list of territories concerned. This semi-Dominion status continued in Southern Rhodesia between 1953 and 1963, when it joined Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland in the Central African Federation, with the latter two territories continuing to be British protectorates. When Northern Rhodesia was given independence in 1964 it adopted the new name of Zambia, prompting Southern Rhodesia to shorten its name to Rhodesia, but Britain did not recognise this latter change.\n\nRhodesia unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965 as a result of the British government's insistence on majority rule as a condition for independence. London regarded this declaration as illegal, and applied sanctions and expelled Rhodesia from the sterling area. Rhodesia continued with its Dominion-style constitution until 1970, and continued to issue British passports to its citizens. The Rhodesian government continued to profess its loyalty to the Sovereign, despite being in a state of rebellion against Her Majesty's Government in London, until 1970, when it adopted a republican constitution following a referendum the previous year. This endured until the state's reconstitution as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979 under the terms of the Internal Settlement; this lasted until the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979, which put it under interim British rule while fresh elections were held. The country achieved independence deemed legal by the international community in April 1980, when Britain granted independence under the name Zimbabwe.\n\nSeveral of Britain's newly independent colonies were dominions during the period from the late 1950s to the early 1990s. Their gradualist constitutions, featuring a Westminster-style parliamentary government and the British monarch as head of state, were typically replaced by republican constitutions in less than a generation:\n\nIn Africa, the Dominion of Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast) existed from 1957 until 1960, when it became the Republic of Ghana. The Federation of Nigeria was established as a dominion in 1960, but became the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1963. The Dominion of Uganda existed from 1962 to 1963. Kenya was a dominion upon independence in 1963, but a republic was declared in 1964. Tanganyika and Zanzibar, predecessor states of Tanzania, were dominions from 1961 to 1962 and 1963 to 1964, respectively. The Dominion of Gambia existed from 1965 until 1970, when it was renamed the Republic of Gambia. Sierra Leone was a dominion from 1961 to 1971. Mauritius was a dominion from 1968 to 1992, when it became a republic.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the Dominion of Trinidad and Tobago existed from 1962 to 1976, when it became the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Guyana was a dominion from 1966 to 1970 and the Co-operative Republic of Guyana thereafter.\n\nMalta was a dominion from 1964 to 1974.\n\nInitially, the Foreign Office of the United Kingdom conducted the foreign relations of the Dominions. A Dominions section was created within the Colonial Office for this purpose in 1907. Canada set up its own Department of External Affairs in June 1909, but diplomatic relations with other governments continued to operate through the governors-general, Dominion High Commissioners in London (first appointed by Canada in 1880; Australia followed only in 1910), and British legations abroad. Britain deemed her declaration of war against Germany in August 1914 to extend to all territories of the Empire without the need for consultation, occasioning some displeasure in Canadian official circles and contributing to a brief anti-British insurrection by Afrikaner militants in South Africa later that year. A Canadian War Mission in Washington, D.C., dealt with supply matters from February 1918 to March 1921.\n\nAlthough the Dominions had had no formal voice in declaring war, each became a separate signatory of the June 1919 peace Treaty of Versailles, which had been negotiated by a British-led united Empire delegation. In September 1922, Dominion reluctance to support British military action against Turkey influenced Britain's decision to seek a compromise settlement. Diplomatic autonomy soon followed, with the U.S.-Canadian Halibut Treaty (March 1923) marking the first time an international agreement had been entirely negotiated and concluded independently by a Dominion. The Dominions Section of the Colonial Office was upgraded in June 1926 to a separate Dominions Office; however, initially, this office was held by the same person that held the office of Secretary of State for the Colonies.\n\nThe principle of Dominion equality with Britain and independence in foreign relations was formally recognised by the Balfour Declaration, adopted at the Imperial Conference of November 1926. Canada's first permanent diplomatic mission to a foreign country opened in Washington, D.C., in 1927. In 1928, Canada obtained the appointment of a British high commissioner in Ottawa, separating the administrative and diplomatic functions of the governor-general and ending the latter's anomalous role as the representative of the British government in relations between the two countries. The Dominions Office was given a separate secretary of state in June 1930, though this was entirely for domestic political reasons given the need to relieve the burden on one ill minister whilst moving another away from unemployment policy. The Balfour Declaration was enshrined in the Statute of Westminster 1931 when it was adopted by the British Parliament and subsequently ratified by the Dominion legislatures.\n\nBritain's declaration of hostilities against Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939 tested the issue. Most took the view that the declaration did not commit the Dominions. Ireland chose to remain neutral. At the other extreme, the conservative Australian government of the day, led by Robert Menzies, took the view that, since Australia had not adopted the Statute of Westminster, it was legally bound by the UK declaration of war—which had also been the view at the outbreak of the First World War—though this was contentious within Australia. Between these two extremes, New Zealand declared that as Britain was or would be at war, so it was too. This was, however, a matter of political choice rather than legal necessity. Canada issued its own declaration of war after a recall of Parliament, as did South Africa after a delay of several days (South Africa on 6 September, Canada on 10 September). Ireland, which had negotiated the removal of British forces from its territory the year before, remained neutral. There were soon signs of growing independence from the other Dominions: Australia opened a diplomatic mission in the US in 1940, as did New Zealand in 1941, and Canada's mission in Washington gained embassy status in 1943.\n\nInitially, the Dominions conducted their own trade policy, some limited foreign relations and had autonomous armed forces, although the British government claimed and exercised the exclusive power to declare wars. However, after the passage of the Statute of Westminster the language of dependency on the Crown of the United Kingdom ceased, where the Crown itself was no longer referred to as the Crown of any place in particular but simply as \"the Crown\". Arthur Berriedale Keith, in Speeches and Documents on the British Dominions 1918–1931, stated that \"the Dominions are sovereign international States in the sense that the King in respect of each of His Dominions (Newfoundland excepted) is such a State in the eyes of international law\". After then, those countries that were previously referred to as \"Dominions\" became Commonwealth realms where the sovereign reigns no longer as the British monarch, but as monarch of each nation in its own right, and are considered equal to the UK and one another.\n\nThe Second World War, which fatally undermined Britain's already weakened commercial and financial leadership, further loosened the political ties between Britain and the Dominions. Australian Prime Minister John Curtin's unprecedented action (February 1942) in successfully countermanding an order from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill that Australian troops be diverted to defend British-held Burma (the 7th Division was then en route from the Middle East to Australia to defend against an expected Japanese invasion) demonstrated that Dominion governments might no longer subordinate their own national interests to British strategic perspectives. To ensure that Australia had full legal power to act independently, particularly in relation to foreign affairs, defence industry and military operations, and to validate its past independent action in these areas, Australia formally adopted the Statute of Westminster in October 1942 and backdated the adoption to the start of the war in September 1939.\n\nThe Dominions Office merged with the India Office as the Commonwealth Relations Office upon the independence of India and Pakistan in August 1947. The last country officially made a Dominion was Ceylon in 1948. The term \"Dominion\" fell out of general use thereafter. Ireland ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth on 18 April 1949, upon the coming into force of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. This formally signalled the end of the former dependencies' common constitutional connection to the British Crown. India also adopted a republican constitution in January 1950. Unlike many dependencies that became republics, Ireland never re-joined the Commonwealth, which agreed to accept the British monarch as head of that association of independent states.\n\nThe independence of the separate realms was emphasised after the accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952, when she was proclaimed not just as Queen of the United Kingdom, but also Queen of Canada, Queen of Australia, Queen of New Zealand, and of all her other \"realms and territories\" etc. This also reflected the change from \"Dominion\" to \"realm\"; in the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth II's new titles in 1953, the phrase \"of her other Realms and Territories\" replaced \"Dominion\" with another mediaeval French word with the same connotation, \"realm\" (from \"royaume\"). Thus, recently, when referring to one of those sixteen countries within the Commonwealth of Nations that share the same monarch, the phrase \"Commonwealth realm\" has come into common usage instead of \"Dominion\" to differentiate the Commonwealth nations that continue to share the monarch as head of state (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Jamaica, etc.) from those that do not (India, Pakistan, South Africa, etc.). The term \"Dominion\" is still found in the Canadian constitution where it appears numerous times, but it is largely a vestige of the past, as the Canadian government does not actively use it (\"see Canada section\"). The term \"realm\" does not appear in the Canadian constitution.\n\nThe generic language of Dominion did not cease in relation to the Sovereign. It was, and is, used to describe territories in which the monarch exercises sovereignty.\n\nMany distinctive characteristics that once pertained only to Dominions are now shared by other states in the Commonwealth, whether republics, independent realms, associated states or territories. The practice of appointing a High Commissioner instead of a diplomatic representative such as an ambassador for communication between the government of a Dominion and the British government in London continues in respect of Commonwealth realms and republics as sovereign states.\n\n\n"}

Besides founding charter management organization Success Academy Charter Schools (originally Harlem Success Academy), she has worked with the Harlem Education Fair, runs the Great Public Schools PAC, StudentsFirstNY, and worked with the New York City Charter School Center. She cowrote \"Mission Possible\" (2012) with Arin Lavinia, mainly a guide to running charter schools. She has a Ph.D. in history, wrote \"In Therapy We Trust\" (2001), and wrote a scholarly study of Betty Friedan's work in 1996.\n\nAs a City Councilmember from 1999-2005 she chaired the Education Committee and lost a primary election to be the Democratic party nominee for Manhattan Borough President in 2005.\n\nMoskowitz grew up in the Columbia University neighborhood of Morningside Heights, Manhattan. She graduated from Stuyvesant High School, where \"she thought half of the teachers were incompetent\", according to Steven Brill and claimed to the \"New Yorker\" she \"didn't learn anything\". She found widespread student cheating and a coverup by the principal, according to \"New York\" magazine, and began to consider that teachers' ability to choose where they would teach based on their seniority meant that they chose Stuyvesant, where, according to Brill, \"the students could teach themselves.\" Moskowitz went to the University of Pennsylvania, where, she said, a professor criticized her writing ability, and she studied writing, getting a B.A. with honors in history and influencing her prioritizing writing by her students at Success Academy Charter Schools. She received a Ph.D. in American history from Johns Hopkins University with her 1991 dissertation, \"Naming the Problem: How Popular Culture and Experts Paved the Way For \"personal politics\".\n\nShe taught women's history at University of Virginia as a visiting professor of communications and mass culture in 1989–1990, Vanderbilt University as an assistant professor of history in 1992–1993, and City University of New York (College of Staten Island) as an assistant professor of history in 1994–1995 and chaired the faculty seminar in American studies at Columbia University in 1996–1999. She was the director of the children's literacy program ReadNet and taught civics at the Prep for Prep school, where she was also the director of public affairs.\n\nBefore entering electoral politics, Moskowitz applied to start a charter school in the Upper East Side, more recently telling Kyle Spencer \"you can live on a posh street and be zoned for a very terrible school.\" Moskowitz withdrew the application before holding electoral office.\n\nMoskowitz is a founder and the chief executive officer of Success Academy Charter Schools. Her compensation for the 2013-2014 school year was $567,500, and she has four assistants.\n\nGreat Public Schools Political Action Committee is run by Moskowitz; according to Brill, Moskowitz founded a PAC after a pro-Success Academy candidate lost an election. The Great Public Schools PAC supports charter schools. In the year 2011–2012, it gave $50,000 to Andrew Cuomo 2014, Inc.\n\nMoskowitz is on the board of StudentsFirstNY, a local branch of Michelle Rhee's nationwide political campaign regarding schools.\n\nMoskowitz said, on international comparisons of education, \"even our highest-performing students are doing worse than many other countries' lowest-performing students\", there's an international crisis,' affecting the affluent neighborhoods she's now [2012] targeting just as seriously as it affects poor ones\", according to Hanlon partly quoting Moskowitz, and Moskowitz said that \"[she doesn't] think that Americans have totally digested the global competition that we're facing.\"\n\nShe states that even in middle-class and more affluent districts public noncharter schools are not as good as parents think they are. She disagreed with requiring children to go to where they are zoned.\n\nAccording to David M. Herszenhorn, in early 2004, Moskowitz questioned whether holding failing 3rd-graders back would boost 4th-grade test scores the next year, because the lower-performing students would still be in the 3rd grade and not taking the 4th-grade tests, just when the Mayor would run for reelection, but city officials called her criticism, in Herszenhorn's word, \"cynical\". Moskowitz, wrote Herszenhorn, arguing that \"there is a consensus among educators that policies against social promotion don't work\", called for, in Herszenhorn's paraphrasing of Moskowitz, \"the city ... to be more creative in its efforts to help struggling students, by improving prekindergarten programs, identifying learning disabilities earlier and perhaps having more nuanced grade levels, like a first grade-plus for students repeating first grade.\" According to Joyce Mayer Perry, in 2004, Moskowitz did not oppose having a failing student repeat a grade but believed that intervention needed to be earlier so that children will succeed.\n\nAccording to Moskowitz, co-locating charters in buildings with noncharters lets parents more easily compare how well their children do in one and how badly in the other and so find out that noncharter schools can be better. She opposed conditioning co-location on letting noncharter schools get credit for charter students' higher test scores, referring to a law in Ohio, because, according to her, it denies accountability and a \"quid pro quo\" has to be more carefully chosen.\n\nAccording to Brill and as interpreted by Boykin Curry, Moskowitz doubted that the New York City public school system can simply be reformed, because it may need a complete turnaround, a replacing of the traditional model with a model derived from charters. Moskowitz wrote that \"[while] much of the growth in excellent public schools has occurred in low-income communities ... [m]iddle-class neighborhoods [also] need more rigorous schools.\" She chose to start charter schools \"to demonstrate the incredible difference it truly makes when a school is run free from crushing bureaucracy and outlandish labor contracts.\"\n\nShe said that public elementary school curricula are not challenging enough for students, who are bored. She, with Arin Lavinia, wrote that math curricula are paced to be taught too slowly, as if they're designed for dysfunctional schools and all schools are expected to be just as slow, and Moskowitz and Lavinia argued for speeding the teaching.\n\nMoskowitz said, in 2009, that state tests are \"too easy\" and, in 2012, that test success would predict economic success and that \"if kids do not do well on the tests, they certainly won't do well in life\" but that \"I wouldn't want a school that only focused on testing, partly because the tests are a low bar.\"\n\nShe favored closing failing public schools, including charter schools, not all charter schools being good. She posited that a charter is not a guarantee of success, as it is only a grant of freedom to try for success.\n\nMoskowitz has criticized schools of education, including master's programs, for graduating teachers who are unable to meet urban challenges. She argued against lengthy, detailed, and relatively inflexible teachers' union contracts and \"ossified, bureaucratic management\" as overly constraining principals.\n\nMoskowitz believed in parental choice for where children go to school, including parochial and other schools. She does not want to \"eradicate\" noncharter schools, believing they need to be modernized \"educationally, operationally, financially\", and she argued for competition to improve failing public schools nationwide. She supported parents at noncharter schools raising money to hire teaching assistants of their choice, opposing the teachers' union's objections. Moskowitz said she's \"never met an apathetic mom.\"\n\nMoskowitz advocated for charter schools to be funded per pupil as fully as public noncharters are. She favored \"a federal role in education... especially in the area of parent choice\" and thought that President Obama's offering substantial money contingent on charter-centered reforms brought \"the fight out\" into public view, contributing to New York and some other states caps on the creation of new charter schools\".\n\nMoskowitz objected to \"a tendency in the charter school movement to celebrate a lack of socio-economic diversity.\" She said, \"I think we need many more charters that have socio-economic integration. I also think that we need to get charter schools into more affluent districts because I think many middle-class and upper middle-class parents think their schools are better than they are ... their schools are very complacent.\" She described New York City schools as \"shockingly segregated\", \"most ... either more than 90 percent minority or less than 10 percent\", with some schools, by offering dual-language or gifted-and-talented programs attracting white middle-class students while \"overwhelmingly poor minority students\" take general education, exhibiting \"fake integration\". She added that the city's \"racial and socio-economic segregation ... [is] hard to change\", impeding efforts to make charter schools into neighborhood schools and still have diversity among students, but continued that \"I think we will change it [the segregation] eventually because our program is so appealing to middle-class families.\" However, she added, \"whether people can put their racial discomforts aside, I do not know\", but later said \"parents of all races and classes truly want diversity as long as it is also accompanied by academic excellence.\"\n\nMoskowitz said that children's minds are \"agile\", that the need is to raise intellectual standards after which \"the kids will rise to our expectation\", and that \"to raise the rigor bar\" doesn't cost money.\n\nMoskowitz argued that, although replication is \"difficult\", \"educational opportunity ... [is not] rocket science\". Part of success was \"old-fashioned parental involvement... It has to be a partnership between parents and the school.\" Another was reading. She said, \"our children read constantly.\" She said, \"and the third ingredient is high-quality teaching. We have to have the very best in our school system and we have to invest in teachers so that they can get better.\" She favored modernization, rigor, accountability, \"highly effective teacher[s,] and ... highly effective principal[s]\". She argued for teachers and school leaders to have more flexibility to innovate in classrooms. She advocated for principals to be able to hire and fire teachers and to attract the best teachers. She supported decentralization in favor of teachers. She called for more disclosure and increasing principals' accountability. She said, \"what you want to teach kids is to think critically, mathematically, scientifically. You want them to be great writers.\" According to Nat Hentoff, when Moskowitz was a City Councilmember she argued for education in civics, on how government works.\n\nShe argued that class sizes should be reconsidered and that allowing a few more students in a class may help in educating the students while being economical. She argued that, when a school is funded on the basis of how many students it has, a larger class size may allow paying the teacher \"exceedingly well\" and having \"really talented\" principals, business managers so principals focus on instructional matters, more supplies and field trips for students and teachers, computers and e-books for students, more professional development, more tutoring, and more teaching staff, such as assistant teachers. She said that students having computers and online books leads to their reading more books. On the other hand, she agreed that a too-large class would be \"absurd.\" Overall, she posited that class size is a factor in students' success.\n\nShe believed schools were responsible for safety, so that, when Nixzmary Brown died (largely due to Brown's parents) after substantial absence from school, Moskowitz said that the child's school was minimally compliant with rules, if that, and did not do enough for the child's safety and therefore for the child's education.\n\nIn \"Mission Possible\" (2012), which Moskowitz cowrote, according to Hanlon Moskowitz argued for the importance of charter schools because public noncharter education \"never put[s] the customer first\" and fails to \"boost productivity and innovate.\" Hanlon said, \"most of the book is a pedagogical how-to\".\n\nAmong Moskowitz's personal views relevant to education, according to Lisa M. Collins Moskowitz \"says social justice drives her\" and, according to Coplon, Moskowitz said \"really fundamental to social justice ... [is] to have choices in life.\" According to Rich Lowry in the conservative \"National Review\", Moskowitz is a liberal. Moskowitz described herself as \"controversial\".\n\nMoskowitz in 2010 said that the chief opponent of charters like hers was \"the union-political-educational complex\", \"the teachers' union and the elected officials ... [who] together can ... stop you from doing a lot of ... good things for kids.\" She argued that charters are more threatening than when they began, partly because there are more charters, even given that not all charters are good.\n\nMoskowitz is a Democrat. The UFT has supported a candidate against Moskowitz in every race she has run.\n\nIn 1995 or 1996, Moskowitz volunteered in Gifford Miller's City Council campaign, becoming his field director. In 1997, according to Vivian S. Toy, Moskowitz ran a \"strong\" campaign for but lost a City Council election. In 1999, she was elected as New York City Councilmember for the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In 2002–2005, she chaired the Council Education Committee and held over \"100 oversight hearings\". According to Joe Williams, \"in December 2003, [UFT union then-president Randi] Weingarten declared war on Moskowitz's political career\" and urged union members to vote against her.\n\nAccording to Winnie Hu in 2004, Moskowitz's staff turnover was substantial, she expected them to work hours not limited to \"government hours\", and she provided them with BlackBerry wireless devices when not all Councilmembers had them. According to Alex Mindlin, one student starting as a volunteer continued with Moskowitz for 5 years, including as a constituent liaison, organizing campaign letter-writing, and coordinating 75 volunteer petitioners.\n\nAccording to Hu, in 2003–2004, Moskowitz, with an \"aggressive, confrontational style\", had \"emerged as one of the most influential [Council] members ..., largely by parlaying her role as head of the Education Committee into a crusade for the city's troubled public schools.\" According to Jonathan P. Hicks, she was \"considered an expert in the Council on education issues\". In 2004, according to Hu, Moskowitz had \"many\" critics and city schools then-chancellor Joel Klein described her as \"tough-minded\" and \"determined\"; according to Coplon, in an undated comment Klein said Moskowitz was \"up there in the top five [\"thorns in his side\"], or the top three\"; and, according to Hu, in 2004, Miller described her as \"a very determined person and very focused, and sometimes that determination can rub people the wrong way\". According to Michael Winerip, in 2005, Moskowitz \"has been one of the few checks on the school system under mayoral control and said it was often a battle getting information and sometimes required a subpoena\" and, according to Coplon and Lizzy Ratner, Moskowitz was known as an aggressive advocate for education reform.\n\nAlso in 2005, wrote Susan Saulny, Moskowitz said \"science education ... has been treated with second-class status for decades\" and that \"the level of concern I think we should have\" is still lacking. Moskowitz held hearings on the shortage of science classes and the inability to pay experienced science and math teachers well.\n\nMoskowitz held hearings in 2003 on the teachers' union contracts, which, according to Hu, \"landed ... [Moskowitz] in the headlines for weeks\" and, according to Ratner, \"attracted reporters and produced headlines.\" Moskowitz also criticized contracts with principals and custodians. According to Williams, Moskowitz's \"public hearings on the impact of work rules and job protections for teachers, principals, and custodians ... [showed] that it took far too long to unload incompetent employees from the system\" and that \"other rules were silly and counterproductive\", namely some for custodians. Williams said Moskowitz's \"hearings attracted hoards [\"sic\"] of reporters and columnists\" and that the then-president of the UFT, Weingarten, \"furious\" that the Council leadership had even permitted the hearings, testified with an \"often caustic exchange\" with Moskowitz. A secret list of witnesses was known to the UFT, some witnesses testified only after their identities were concealed, and some others refused to testify after agreeing to, according to Williams. \"At the time, Moskowitz was the only Democratic official in New York City who was elected without the UFT's endorsement\", wrote Williams, who also reported that Moskowitz was privately warned that the hearings could end her political career and that she recognized that winning citywide office in the future would be easier if she was supported and not opposed by the union. Miller, then the Council speaker, let Moskowitz go forward with the hearings, Brian McLaughlin, leader of the New York City Central Labor Council, opposed them, and Bloomberg went from calling Moskowitz a \"gadfly\" the night before the hearings to praising her courage and criticizing her critics who were Council colleagues, according to Williams. There was an effort to replace Moskowitz as committee chair, said Williams, but she served her full term.\n\nShe also held hearings on the seeming absence of toilet paper. She reported many parents' complaints about toilets being dirty, broken, or closed citywide and her own experience as a high school student with having to go across the street to a medical facility.\n\nAccording to Hicks, Moskowitz was the \"author of a law, passed ... over ... Bloomberg's veto, that holds the School Construction Authority accountable for delays and budget overruns.\"\n\nAccording to Hu, in \"ca.\" 2002–2004 Moskowitz wrote six laws, including on health care and campaign finance reform.\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\"'s Kelly Crow, in 2002, in response to public housing tenants' security concerns at the Stanley Isaacs Houses, Moskowitz arranged for funding for cameras but the money was never spent by the city, and the police offered more patrols but said crime was worse uptown.\n\nThe next year, Moskowitz introduced a gun control bill.\n\nShe introduced a bill to require baby diaper-changing stations in some buildings, at pools, and in parks and a bill to ban the sale and installing of audible car alarms.\n\nShe also tried to increase voter registration among young people through the schools.\n\nIn 2005, Moskowitz decided not to run again for the Council and entered the race for the Democratic party nomination to be the Manhattan Borough President to succeed C. Virginia Fields, according to Hicks emphasizing education and transportation issues. The teachers' union campaigned heavily for Scott Stringer and against Moskowitz, based on Moskowitz's hearings about the teachers' contract and on other education issues, and so did the Working Families Party. According to Francis Barry, the Working Families Party spent most of the approximately $100,000 it spent on the race \"to attack ... Moskowitz, who had made her name by challenging the teachers' union.\" Moskowitz raised almost $1 million and qualified for another $600,000 in city matching funds during the campaign, according to Hicks. Ultimately, Moskowitz raised the most money of any Democratic candidate, but finished second to Stringer.\nMoskowitz ran on a platform of improving education options and opposing MTA subway and bus fare hikes, and adopted campaign rhetoric about inequality reminiscent of Bill de Blasio's 2013 bid for mayor.\n\"Our borough has become a place of the haves and the have-nots,\" Moskowitz was quoted as saying during her campaign kickoff on the City Hall steps in February 2005.\n\nIn 2005, Moskowitz endorsed Bloomberg for Mayor. In 2010, she credited Bloomberg and his appointee Klein as schools chancellor with education improvements.\n\nMoskowitz stated her intention to run for Mayor of New York, with, she said in 2012, a \"70 to 80 percent chance\" she will run in 2017.\n\nMoskowitz wrote the book, \"In Therapy We Trust\". According to Jesse Eisinger, Moskowitz identified \"three tenets: happiness is the supreme goal, problems stem from psychological causes, and those psychological problems are treatable\" and labeled this set \"the therapeutic gospel, a doctrine so ingrained in American society that few of us consciously recognize it\".\n\nIn the book, Moskowitz made several points: \"We are ... bound together by a gospel of psychological happiness... Americans turn to psychological cures as reflexively as they once turned to God. But our relationship to the psyche appears to have exceeded that of believers and become more like that of cult members.\" Reformers recommended hiring \"visiting teachers\" who would understand children when some school principals still believed in \"more drill\". \"The persistence of Americans' faith in psychological happiness is troubling... Rather than offering real psychological insight, these cures are vapid therapies. There is little rigorous psychological thinking in our culture.\" \"Psychological interpretations tend to crowd out social, economic, and political ones.\" \"While I have no argument with psychological contentment as an important standard for individuals and no argument with in-depth psychological investigation as a means, when a whole society makes happiness and self-realization its rallying cry, clearly something is lost in the process.\"\n\nMoskowitz directed and produced a 1997 documentary on women's roles after World War II. The VHS-only video \"Some Spirit in Me\" (1993) was written, produced, and directed by Moskowitz.\n\nMoskowitz wrote a scholarly study of Betty Friedan's work.\n\nMoskowitz has faced criticism for closing her schools so that students and parents may participate in political protests, and providing free transportation to a protest rally outside the State Capital in Albany.\n\nIn June 2013, during his campaign for Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio criticized Moskowitz's Success Academy Charter Schools for using public-school space without paying rent. During an interview at the \"Save our Schools\" rally in Washington D.C., actor Matt Damon said of collocation: \"Eva Moskowitz just spent $1.7 million in advertising, as in marketing for her[self] ... [this] kind of core inequality has to be addressed.\" Damon was citing a New York \"Daily News\" article in which the actual figure was $1.6 million, a sum that has been disputed by a spokeswoman for the Success Network. Additionally, critics have pointed out that in her dispute with Mayor de Blasio regarding collocation, her organization's expansion into a public school in Harlem would have displaced students there with disabilities.\n\nProtests and legal disputes involving Moskowitz and Success Academy Charter Schools are depicted in the pro-charter school film \"The Lottery,\" as well as the critical documentary \"The Inconvenient Truth Behind Waiting for Superman.\"\n\nMoskowitz has been criticized by education historian and former Deputy Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch on numerous occasions, including interviews, op-eds, and on her education blog.\n\nCriticisms have been leveled at Moskowitz's record educating low-performing, English-language learning, and disabled students. English-language learners are significantly underrepresented at Success, and critics have charged that some lower-grade children eligible for government-mandated special education accommodation, or IEPs, have been withdrawn, effectively winnowing students before third grade, the year state testing begins.\n\nMoskowitz met with United States President-Elect Donald Trump on November 16, 2016 for a possible appointment in the Trump administration as United States Secretary of Education. Previous reporting noted that under Moskowitz, a Democrat, hedge fund manager John Paulson, a major Trump ally, has provided Success an $8.5 million donation in 2015.\n\nShe married Eric Grannis. They have three children, Culver, Dillon, and Hannah, the former of whom attended , a private school in Manhattan, and the latter two of whom attend Success Academy Harlem East, also in Manhattan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12028600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12028600", "title": "Greeks in Egypt", "text": "Greeks in Egypt\n\nThere has been a large community of Greeks in Egypt, also known as Egyptiotes (), from the Hellenistic period until the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution of 1952, when most were forced to leave.\n\nGreeks have been present in Egypt since at least the 7th century BC. Herodotus visited Egypt in the 5th century BC and claimed that the Greeks were one of the first groups of foreigners that ever lived in Egypt. Diodorus Siculus claimed that Rhodian Actis, one of the Heliadae, built the city of Heliopolis before the cataclysm; likewise the Athenians built Sais. Siculus reports that all the Greek cities were destroyed during the cataclysm, but the Egyptian cities including Heliopolis and Sais survived.\n\nAccording to Herodotus (ii. 154), King Psammetichus I (664–610 BC) established a garrison of foreign mercenaries at Daphnae, mostly Carians and Ionian Greeks.\n\nIn 7th century BC, after the Greek Dark Ages from 1100-750 BC, the city of Naucratis was founded in Ancient Egypt. It was located on the Canopic branch of the Nile river, 45 mi (72 km) from the open sea. It was the first and, for much of its early history, the only permanent Greek colony in Egypt; acting as a symbiotic nexus for the interchange of Greek and Egyptian art and culture.\n\nAt about the same time, the city of Heracleion, the closest to the sea, became an important port for Greek trade. It had a famous temple of Heracles. The city later sank into the sea, only to be rediscovered recently.\n\nFrom the time of Psammetichus I onwards, Greek mercenary armies played an important role in some of the Egyptian wars. One such army was led by Mentor of Rhodes. Another such personage was Phanes of Halicarnassus.\n\nAlexander the Great conquered Egypt at an early stage of his conquests. He respected the pharaonic religions and customs and he was proclaimed Pharaoh of Egypt. He established the city of Alexandria. After his death, in 323 BC, his empire was divided among his generals. Egypt was given to Ptolemy I Soter, whose descendants would give Egypt her final royal dynasty — a glittering one, largely Greek in flavor. Its capital was Alexandria. Ptolemy added legitimacy to his rule in Egypt by acquiring Alexander's body. He intercepted the embalmed corpse on its way to burial, brought it to Egypt, and placed it in a golden coffin in Alexandria. It would remain one of the famous sights of the town for many years, until probably destroyed in riots in the 3rd century AD.\n\nThe initial objective of Ptolemy's reign was to establish firm and broad boundaries to his newly acquired kingdom. That led to almost continuous warfare against other leading members of Alexander's circle. At times he held Cyprus and even parts of mainland Greece. When these conflicts were over, he was firmly in control of Egypt and had strong claims (disputed by the Seleucid dynasty) to Palestine. He called himself king of Egypt from 306 BC. By the time he abdicated in 285 BC, in favour of one of his sons, the Ptolemaic dynasty was secure. Ptolemy and his descendants showed respect to Egypt's most cherished traditions — those of religion — and turned them to their own advantage. Alexandria became the centre of the Greek and Hellenistic world and the centre of international commerce, art and science. The Lighthouse of Alexandria was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World while during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Library of Alexandria was the biggest library in the world until it was destroyed. The last Pharaoh was a Greek princess, Cleopatra VII, who took her own life in 30 BC, a year after the battle of Actium.\n\nUnder Greco-Roman rule, Egypt hosted several Greek settlements, mostly concentrated in Alexandria, but also in a few other cities, where Greek settlers lived alongside some seven to ten million native Egyptians. Faiyum's earliest Greek inhabitants were soldier-veterans and \"cleruchs\" (elite military officials) who were settled by the Ptolemaic kings on reclaimed lands. Native Egyptians also came to settle in Faiyum from all over the country, notably the Nile Delta, Upper Egypt, Oxyrhynchus and Memphis, to undertake the labor involved in the land reclamation process, as attested by personal names, local cults and recovered papyri. It is estimated that as much as 30 percent of the population of Faiyum was Greek during the Ptolemaic period, with the rest being native Egyptians. By the Roman period, much of the \"Greek\" population of Faiyum was made up of either Hellenized Egyptians or people of mixed Egyptian-Greek origins. By the time of Roman emperor Caracalla in the 2nd century CE, \"genuine\" ethnic Egyptians could be easily differentiated from Alexandria's Greeks \"by their speech.\"\n\nWhile commonly believed to represent Greek settlers in Egypt, the Fayum mummy portraits instead reflect the complex synthesis of the predominant Egyptian culture and that of the elite Greek minority in the city. According to Walker, the early Ptolemaic Greek colonists married local women and adopted Egyptian religious beliefs, and by Roman times, their descendants were viewed as Egyptians by the Roman rulers, despite their own self-perception of being Greek. The dental morphology of the Roman-period Faiyum mummies was also compared with that of earlier Egyptian populations, and was found to be \"much more closely akin\" to that of ancient Egyptians than to Greeks or other European populations. Victor J. Katz notes that \"research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities\".\n\nGreek culture and political influence continued and perhaps reached its most influential times during the Ottoman Caliphate, which witnessed many Ottoman Sultans and Pashas of Greek ancestry rule over the Ottoman Empire in general, and Egypt in particular. Other notable Greeks in Egypt during the Ottoman period included Damat Hasan Pasha from the Morea, a governor of Egypt. Raghib Pasha, born in Greece to Greek parents, served as Prime Minister of Egypt. During the Ottoman Caliphate, Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha, Grand Vizier to Suleiman the Magnificent from 1520–1566, is perhaps the best known.\n\nMany Greek Muslims from Crete (often confusingly called Cretan Turks) were resettled in Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, and Syria by Sultan Abdul Hamid II after the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 that resulted in the autonomy of Crete (see the example of al-Hamidiyah, a largely Cretan Greek Muslim village in Syria).\n\nIn 1907, the census showed 62,973 Greeks living in Egypt. By 1940, Greeks numbered about 250,000. The Greek community in Alexandria lived around the church and convent of Sabbas the Sanctified. In the same area there was a guest house for Greek travelers, a Greek hospital and later a Greek school. The Greek Orthodox bishop was based in Damietta in the church of Nikolaos of Myrna.\n\nIn Cairo, the first organised Greek community was founded in 1856, with the community based in three main neighbourhoods: Tzouonia, Haret el Roum (Street of the Greeks), and in Hamzaoui. The patriarchate was based in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, Azbakeya. The monastery of Saint George, in Old Cairo still survives. The monastery is surrounded by a huge wall and topped by a stone tower. Within its walls there was a Greek hospital, a school and housing for the elderly and poor.\n\nIn addition to the Greek communities of Alexandria and Cairo, there were the organised Greek communities of Mansoura, founded in 1860, Port Said, founded in 1870, Tanta in 1880, and the community of Zagazig in 1850. There were fifteen smaller communities across Egypt and mainly around Cairo and Alexandria. In Upper Egypt, the oldest ancient Greek community was the one of Minia which was founded in 1812.\n\nThe first banks in Egypt were crafted by Greeks, including the Bank of Alexandria, the Anglo-Egyptian bank (Sunadinos family / Συναδινός), and the General Bank of Alexandria. Also, it was the Greek agriculturists and farmers that first systematically and with scientific planning, cultivated cotton and tobacco. They improved the quantity and quality of production and dominated cotton and tobacco exports. Notable families in tobacco commerce were the Salvagos (), Benakis (), Rodochanakis () and Zervoudachis (). The tobacco cultivars used for cigarette manufacturing, e.g., by Kyriazi Freres, were of Greek origin. A thriving commerce between Greece and Egypt was thus established. Other areas of interest for the Greeks in Egypt were foods, wine, soap, wood crafts, printing.\n\nIn the food industry, the macaroni industries of Melachrinos () and Antoniados () were well known. Another example was the cheese and butter production of Archyriou (), Roussoglou (Ρ) and Paleoroutas (). Chocolate-Biscuits and Toffee producers were: Daloghlou (), Russos (), Repapis (); Oil-soaps-vegetable fats (Salt & Soda) producers like Zerbinis () were based in Kafr al-Zayat. There were many Greek theatres and cinemas. Major Greek newspapers were \"Ta grammata\" (), \"Tahidromos\"(), and \"Nea Zoi\" (). The Greek community in Egypt has produced numerous artists, writers, diplomats and politicians, the most famous being the poet Constantine P. Cavafy (), also the painter Konstantinos Parthenis ().\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars, the Greek communities of Egypt sent volunteers, funded hospitals, and accommodated families of the soldiers. During World War II (1940–1945), more than 7000 Greeks fought for the Allies in the Middle East; 142 died. Their financial contribution reached 2500 million Egyptian pounds. After the Suez Crisis, the British and French laborers left while the Greeks stayed.\n\nThe emergence of a Greek aristocracy of rich industrialists, commercants and bankers created the legacy of Greek-Egyptian philanthropism. These benefactors donated large amounts for the building of schools, academies, hospitals and institutions in both Egypt and Greece. Michail Tositsas donated large amounts for the building of the Athens University, the Amalio Orphanage and the Athens Polytechnic. His wife Eleni Tositsa donated the land for the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. George Averoff also contributed to the building of the National Technical University of Athens, the Evelpidon Military Academy and the donation of the cruiser \"Averoff\" to the Hellenic Navy. Emmanouil Benakis contributed to the building of the National Gallery of Athens, while his son Antonis Benakis was the founder of the Benaki Museum. Other major benefactors include Nikolaos Stournaras, Theodoros Kotsikas, Nestoras Tsanaklis, Konstantinos Horemis, Stefanos Delta, Penelope Delta, Pantazis Vassanis and Vassilis Sivitanidis.\n\nThe exodus of Greeks from Egypt started before the revolution of 1952. With the establishment of the new sovereign regime of Gamal Abdel Nasser, rise of Pan-Arab nationalism, and the subsequent nationalisation of many industries in 1961 and 1963, thousands of Greek employees decided to abandon the country. Many of them emigrated to Australia, the United States, Canada, South Africa, Western Europe, and Greece. Many Greek schools, churches, small communities and institutions subsequently closed, but many continue to function to this day. The Nasser regime saw a big exodus of the Greeks from Egypt, but most of the minority left the country either before or after the period 1952-1970. The Arab-Israeli wars of 1956 and 1967 contributed to the uprooting of the sizeable Greek community in the Suez Canal cities, especially Port Said.\n\nToday the Greek community numbers officially about 5,000 people although many of Greek origin are now counted as Egyptian, having changed their nationality. In Alexandria, apart from the Patriarchate, there is a Patriarchal theology school that opened recently after 480 years being closed. Saint Nicholas church in Cairo and several other buildings in Alexandria have been recently renovated by the Greek Government and the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation. Saint George's church in Old Cairo is undergoing restoration to end in 2014. During the last decade, there has been a new interest from the Egyptian government for a diplomatic rapprochement with Greece and this has positively affected the Greek Diaspora. The Diaspora has received official visits of many Greek politicians. Economic relationships between Greece and Egypt have expanded. As of 2010, Egypt has received major Greek investments in banking, tourism, paper, the oil industry, & many others. In 2009, a five-year cooperation-memorandum was signed among the NCSR Demokritos Institute in Agia Paraskevi, Athens and the University of Alexandria, regarding Archeometry research and contextual sectors.\n\nGreeks of Cyrene (the Cyrenaica is a region corresponding to modern eastern Libya) are also included, as during antiquity it held close relations to the Egyptian kingdoms, and at some points, also used to be a part of the Ptolemaic kingdom. The presence of an asterisk (*) next to a person's name denotes that the person was born outside of Egypt, however the most part of this person's life or most important work occurred while in Egypt.\n\n\n"}

They are scattered across all the regions in Ghana. Guans speak distinct languages which are different from the major languages in Ghana except Gonja. However, some of these Guan languages are influenced by major languages in Ghana, depending on where a particular Guang tribe is located. Guans in the Eastern region include Anum, Boso, Larteh, Okere, and Kyerepong.

{"id": "21360369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21360369", "title": "Gungnyeo", "text": "Gungnyeo\n\nGungnyeo (literally \"palace women\") is a Korean term referring to women waiting on the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. It is short for \"gungjung yeogwan\", which translates as \"a lady officer of the royal court\". \"Gungnyeo\" includes \"sanggung\" (palace matron) and \"nain\" (assistant court ladies), both of which hold rank as officers. The term is also used more broadly to encompass women in a lower class without a rank such as \"musuri\" (lowest maids in charge of odd chores), \"gaksimi\", \"sonnim\", \"uinyeo\" (female physicians) as well as \"nain\" and \"sanggung\". The term spans those from courtiers to domestic workers.\n\nAlthough the first record of \"gungnyeo\" appears in \"Goryeosa\", a compilation on the history of Goryeo, a provision was first made in 1392 by King Taejo per Jo Jun (趙浚) and other officers' suggestions after the establishment of the Joseon Dynasty. In 1428 Sejong the Great set up a detailed system regulating \"gungnyeo\", in which female officers were divided into \"naegwan\" (internal offices, concerned with the royal court) and \"gunggwan\" (palace officers), and defined their ranks, titles, and social status. He further institutionalized the system, with revisions, in the Gyeongguk daejeon (Complete Code of Laws).\n\nThe \"gungnyeo\" were not clearly defined during the Goryeo period, and it is not known how they came to serve the court and what procedures applied to them. The use of the term during that period is therefore assumed to refer to all women in the king's service in the court. In documents related to Goryeo, the social status of \"gungnyeo\" was generally commoner or lower class, such as the daughters of slaves, concubines, or cheonmin (the despised). In the 22nd year of King Uijong \"gungnyeo\" roles were divided into \"sanggung\" (尙宮, managing the palace), \"sangchim\" (尙寢, managing bedding), \"sangsik\" (尙食 managing food), and another type of \"sangchim\" (尙針, managing sewing). Female musicians called \"yeoak\" were also a part of the \"gungnyeo\".\n\nDuring the Joseon Dynasty, court life was centered on the King, so many court women were necessary. They were assigned to the \"Daejeon\" (大殿; the Great Hall), \"Naejeon\" (內殿, private inner royal hall), the \"Daebijeon\" (the Queen dowager's quarter), or the \"Sejajeon\" (the crown prince's quarter) of the palace.\n\nThe appointment of \"gungnyeo\" usually occurred one year in ten, but there were exceptions; the method of appointing \"gungnyeo\" and their social status differed from time to time, so the process was not systematized. In general, gungnyeo were chosen from among female slaves who belonged to the governing class rather than from daughters of the \"sangmin\" (common people in rank). However, if circumstances allowed, people around the king wanted to pick \"gungnyeo\" from commoners' children, using a custom of early marriage in households that had a daughter over ten years old. As a result, since King Gyeongjong's reign, daughters from the lower class were prohibited to be appointed as \"gungnyeo\". According to the \"Sokdaejeon\" (Supplement to the National Code), some female slaves of each government office were chosen to become \"gungnyeo\" since the reign of King Yeongjo.\n\nWhile this restriction on class applied to \"common gungnyeo\", the appointment of those in important roles, closely waiting on the king and queen, such as \"jimil nain\", was different. The standard for choosing \"jimil nain\" was so high that \"sanggung\" tended to go out recruiting candidates through personal connections and by family custom. There were many \"gungnyeo\" in service who recommended their relatives for the position. The social status of the \"gungnyeo\" who were assigned to \"jimil\", \"chimbang\" (the sewing department), and \"subang\" (the embroidery department) came from the \"jungin\" class (literally \"middle class\"); the others mostly came from \"commoner's class\". Common \"gungnyeo\" entered the palace at the age of twelve to thirteen, whereas \"jimil nain\" entered there at the age of four to eight, and \"nain\" for the sewing and embroidery departments began to serve the court at six to thirteen.\n\nSuch \"trainee \"gungnyeo\"\" received the necessary education to become \"gungnyeo\", such as learning court language, required daily conducts and behaviors, and writing \"gungche\" (palace-style font). Some \"gungnyeo\" left refined calligraphy works written in hangul (the Korean alphabet) with the \"gungche\" or \"Gyechuk ilgi\" (Diary of the Year Gyechuk, 1613) and \"Inhyeon wanghujeon\" (Tales of Queen Inhyeon), all of which are regarded as excellent examples of the \"palace literature\".\n\n\"Gungnyeo\" always distinguished themselves from the \"sanggung\" and \"nain\" because the role and social status of the groups were greatly different. The latter groups can be divided into three types; trainee \"nain\", \"nain\", and \"sanggung\". They were treated differently according experience and length of service at court and in affiliated departments. Even the \"sanggung\" group was divided by rank according to their experience, and sanggung with the same rank did not always have the same social standing. Trainee nain referred to girls who had not yet passed the gwallye (冠禮, a coming-of-age ceremony), and they were divided into \"saenggaksi\" and \"gaksi\". The term, \"saenggaksi\" derives from the fact that the girls had a hairstyle called \"saengmeori\". Only three departments, \"jimil\", \"chimbang\", and \"subang\" had the \"saenggaksi\". After 15 years service in the palace the trainee \"nain\" became an official \"nain\". \"Nain\" wore a jade-colored \"dangui\" (a variety of \"jeogori\", a short jacket) and a navy blue \"chima\" (a bulky skirt) and decorated their head with a frog-shaped \"cheopji\" (a hairpin).\n\n\"Gaksimi\" is a generic term collectively referring to a housemaid, kitchen-maid, seamstress or others working at a sanggung's private residence on the sanggung's days off. Their monthly salary was paid by the state, so they were also called \"bangja\". The term \"bangja\" means a clerk working at a government office and is the same as the male character called \"bangja\" who appears in \"Chunhyangjeon\" (Story of Chunhyang). \"Musuri\" refers to women in charge of miscellaneous jobs (such as drawing water, making a fire, etc.) at every residence at court.\n\n\"Sonnim\" is a type of housemaid who took charge of housekeeping at the king's concubine's residence. They were generally related to the concubine's family, and their salary was paid from the concubine's living expenses. The term means a person from outside of the palace and is a courtesy title, unlike \"musuri\" and \"gaksimi\".\n\n\"Uinyeo\" literally means \"medicine women\" and they usually treated \"gungnyeo\" with acupuncture and acted as midwife when the king's consort or concubine gave birth. Whenever a feast was held at court they transformed themselves into \"gisaeng\" (female entertainers). For such occasions, they wore \"wonsam\" (a female ceremonial garment), \"hwagwan\" (an elaborate coronet) on their head and colorfully striped \"hansam\" (fabric extensions on the sleeves of the costume) on their hands just like dancers, so they were also called \"yakbang gisaeng\". Consequently, \"yakbang\" is another name for \"naeuiwon\" (royal health clinic). Although \"uinyeo\"'s affiliation was to the \"naeuiwon\", their predecessors were gisaeng. The \"uinyeo\" system was originally established during King Taejong's reign because sick consorts, concubines and gungnyeo preferred to die rather than to be seen by a male doctor, due to the strict \"naeoebeop\" (sex segregation), based on Confucianism, at that time.\n\nSlave girls who belonged to storage or government offices were therefore chosen to train in medical practices such as pulse-checking, acupuncture and others. Because they were originally uneducated \"cheonmin\" (the despised), the uinyeo system was not very fruitful. During King Yeonsangun's reign, whenever a feast was held at each government office, \"uinyeo\" were told to participate in it as \"gisaeng\" with makeup. The system lasted until the end of the dynasty and the number of \"uinyeo\" was about 80 during King Gojong's reign. The \"uinyeo\" system disappeared when Western doctors entered the court.\n\n\"Gungnyeo\" can be described as a type of luxurious slaves for royal private life, needed in departments in charge of clothing, cooking and housing among others. Such places were \"jimil\" (\"the innermost quarter\", waiting closely on royalty), \"chimbang\" (the sewing department), \"subang\" (the embroidery department), two \"sojubang\"; \"naesojobang\" and \"oesojubang\", one for preparing daily meals, another for preparing food for banquets, \"saenggwabang\" (the dessert department), and \"sedapbang\" (the laundry department).\n\nIn addition to those seven departments, four other departments existed: \"sesugan\" (洗手間, the department in charge of the king and queen's washing and bathing), \"toeseongan\" (退膳間; a food arrangement room), \"bogicheo\" (僕伊處, the department for making fires), \"deungchokbang\" (燈燭房 the department for lanterns and candlelight).\n\nIn terms of a more common individual's household \"jimil nain\", who had the highest standing in \"gungnyeo\" society, acted like a personal maid to the mistress. \"Nain\" (assistant court ladies) at \"chimbang\", and \"subang\" were like seamstresses while \"nain\" at \"sojubang\" and \"saenggwabang\" were like kitchen-maids. \"Sedapbang\" managed the laundry; in common families, female slaves generally did the cleaning, while experienced housewives ironed and smoothed laundry by pounding. \"Jimil nain\" had the highest social status while nain at \"chimbang\", and \"subang\" were next in status. They could wear a \"chima\" (a bulky skirt) in the way which \"yangban\" women did, and were allowed as a privilege to let it down long without wearing an apron. Since they worked on a floor or in a room, these nain did not need to fold up their skirt, unlike nain at \"sojubang\", and \"sedapbang\". Nain at the other departments rolled up their skirt with an apron. Likewise, only the former three departments could have \"saenggaksi\" (생각시, young \"nain\" with a hairstyle called \"saeng\" or \"sayang\"), while young nain at the others could not bind their hair with \"saeng\" but had to let it down in long braids.\n\nGungnyeo society had supervisors who acted as the head of the \"gungnyeo\" group, and \"sanggung\" who received special treatment according to the importance of their job. \"Jejo sanggung\" (提調尙宮), also called \"Keunbang sanggung\" were senior among gungnyeo and received the king's orders and managed properties in the queen's quarter. They exercised political power at the time. \"Bujejo sanggung\" also called \"Arigo sanggung\" (阿里庫) took charge of items in stores attached to the queen's quarter. \"Jimil sanggung\" also called \" Daeryeong sanggung\" waited closely on the king. \"Bomo sanggung\" took charge of nursing princes or princesses, and among them those who served the crown prince had the highest standing among the group. \"Sinyeo sanggung\" were in charge of assisting the king, queen and queen dowager whenever a national ceremony or feast occurred. They also managed books and documents of the \"Jimil sanggung\" and did \"gokeup\" (mourning and crying loudly). \"Gamchal sanggung\" gave rewards or punishments to relevant gungnyeo, acting as a supervisors, and were held in awe by other gungnyeo. Some \"gungnyeo\" who were favoured by the king could take political power and improve their rank.\n\nPalace ladies were subordinated to the queen, and were ranked below the Royal Noble Consorts (\"ne-gwan\" 내관). The ranks for gungnyeo would could reach the 5th rank at the highest, but typically started much lower in the 9th rank.\n\nThere were 5 ranks for palace ladies with two level each.\n\n\nThe palace ladies were followed by lower rank ladies-in-waiting (e.g. palace lady candidates), servants and slaves.\n\nThe total number of \"gungnyeo\" included not only \"gungnyeo\" at the main palace where the king resided but also at \"Jesagung\", palaces for \"jesa\", (ancestor veneration) and \"Byeolgung\", (annexed palaces). \"Gungnyeo\" who worked within the main palace despised those who worked in annexed palaces, calling them \"gunggeot\" (the one at the palace). In the main palace, the king's quarter was managed as an independent household, and all of the king, queen, queen dowager's quarters had the same number of \"gungnyeo\". It has been suggested that \"gungnyeo\" numbered 90 in total. Each of these residences would have twenty to twenty seven \"jimil nain\" and the other places would have fifteen to twenty.\n\nThe total number differed from time and was increased or decreased depending on circumstances at court. While the number of \"gungnyeo\" in the early period of the Joseon Dynasty was not great, it tended to increase as time went by. During King Seongjong's reign (1469–1494), 105 \"gungnyeo\" in total served the palace, with 29 for the mother of the previous king, 27 for the queen dowager's quarter and 49 for the king's quarter. During the reign of King Gojong (1863–1907), the total number of \"gungnyeo\" reached 480; 100 for the king's quarter, 100 for the queen dowager's quarter, 100 for the queen, 60 for the crown prince, 40 for the consort of the heir apparent, 50 for the \"seson\", the son of the prince successor, and 30 for the wife of the \"seson\".\n\nAll \"gungnyeo\" within the palace were basically tied for life, from their acceptance into the palace until the time at which they had to leave. Once they entered service they had to live inside the palace for their whole life, except for special occasions. Apart from the king and his immediate household, nobody, not even his concubines, could die in the royal court, so when \"gungnyeo\" became old or ill, they had to leave the palace. There were other reasons to release \"gungnyeo\" from the palace, such as when their superior or master was ill, or when a drought happened, a certain number of \"gungnyeo\" were released in appeasement of the natural calamity. In the latter case, such released \"gungnyeo\" were restricted in their actions, prohibited from marrying, and would be harshly punished if they violated these rules. Thus \"gungnyeo\" lived completely isolated from outside life, and were not allowed to contact men, or even other women, except by release from service. The life of \"gungnyeo\" is depicted in an ancient novel titled \"Unyeongjeon\" (雲英傳) written by an anonymous writer during the Joseon Dynasty.\n\n\"Gungnyeo\" received a graded monthly salary according to rank and living necessities as their payment, but the price was not fixed. It varied according to economic circumstances at that time. Service was assumed to be on a day-shift basis.\n\n\n\n"}

Their target audience are readers interested in self-help, personal growth, and alternative medicine.\n\nHay House was founded in 1984, and incorporated in 1987, to market Louise Hay's self help books, including, \"Heal Your Body\" and \"You Can Heal Your Life\". Soon after Hay House began publishing for other authors that fall into the category of mind-body-spirit such as Wayne Dyer, Suze Orman, Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, Sylvia Browne, Travis Smiley and Doreen Virtue.\n\nReid Tracy joined Hay House as an accountant in 1988. He went on to take over as the CEO in 1990 at the age of 25.\n\nThey are headquartered in Carlsbad, California with auxiliary offices in New York, London, Sydney, Johannesburg, and New Delhi.\n\nAs of 2018, Hay House reports that they publish books by more than 130 authors and sells their products and services in over 35 countries and that they employ over 100 full time staff members.\n\nHay House publishes authors who write on such topics as psychic reading, energy healing, meditation, tarot cards, alternative medicine, numerology, astrology, and holistic health. Hay House hosts group events where fans can pay for admission to seminars by the authors who can then make presentations. They also publish CDs, DVDs, calendars and card decks.\n\nThe publisher also offers a radio station, Hay House Radio, which provides live radio shows by Hay House authors. They also have spin off websites such as Hay House Online Learning, a place to take online classes by their authors, and Heal Your Life, an online self-help and personal growth program. These services are available as applications for phones and tablets. They also have a division called Balboa Press, a self publishing company, which was created in partnership with Author Solutions in 2010. \n\nHay House promotes the idea that “traditional Western learning, as codified by universities that bestow fancy degrees, is woefully incomplete, sometimes harmful, and must be supplemented by other ways of knowing”. Hay House founder, Louise Hay, explains that Hay House does not actually endorse everything their authors write. They also do turn away some authors and work hard to stay on trend with the latest fashions in self-help.\n\nIn a 2008 article Oppenheimer quotes current CEO, Reid Tracy, as saying, “As of right now we’ve sold over 40 million products in the U.S., and we think a lot of those people have been helped.” Hay House does not test the claims made by their authors.

{"id": "382412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=382412", "title": "Heroic medicine", "text": "Heroic medicine\n\nHeroic medicine, also referred to as heroic depletion theory, was a therapeutic method advocating for rigorous treatment of bloodletting, purging, and sweating to shock the body back to health after an illness caused by a humoral imbalance. Rising to the front of orthodox medical practice in the \"Age of Heroic Medicine\" (1780–1850), it fell out of favor in the mid-19th century as more gentle, palliative treatments became the norm.\n\nPockets of medical methodology that can be classified as \"heroic\" appear in the early 17th century with Parisian physician Guy Patin and French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger. Patin, nicknamed \"Le Grand Saigneur\" (the Grand Bloodletter), was infamous for his rigorous procedure plans, which included intensive courses of bloodletting and application of senna. Because heroic medicine used popular techniques, it is difficult to absolutely classify a healer's therapeutic epistemology as heroic. Intensive bloodletting treatments can be identified throughout American history, with William Douglass in Massachusetts advocating for a heroic treatment plan in the early 18th century. While there were practitioners here and there who were particularly eager to perform aggressive treatment, heroic medicine did not become a concentrated school of thought until later in the 18th century.\n\nMany associate Benjamin Rush with an abrupt acceptance of heroic techniques into the realm of mainstream medicine, especially in America. Founding father, creator of University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, and known as the \"American Hippocrates,\" Rush was well respected and revered in the medical field. The Philadelphia Yellow Fever outbreak in 1793 is looked upon as a major event in the merging of heroic medicine into the course of best practices in the medical profession. Much of the city was left incapacitated by the rampant epidemic. As healers fled the city, Rush bravely remained to treat people, and ultimately himself, with drastic regimens of intensive bloodlettings and purgatives. He taught many students who then carried the tradition to other parts of the United States. Varied in its influence, heroic medicine was particularly concentrated around Pennsylvania and spread into other locations. The term \"heroic medicine\" was coined later in the mid-19th century to describe extreme treatment.\n\nHeroic medicine was used to treat George Washington on his deathbed in 1799. He was bled repeatedly and given Mercury(I) chloride (calomel) and several blisters of cantharidin to induce sweating. Washington died shortly after receiving this rigorous heroic treatment.\n\nHeroic medicine was very much in the hands of the professional, as the invasive interventions involved were beyond the capabilities of rustic practitioners. Symptoms were not regarded as the body's attempt to fight the disease, but were considered a complication that would exacerbate the patient's condition and do further harm. Practitioners believed that a fever should be suppressed and any drugs used should be powerful and given in large dosages. Under this onslaught, domestic medicine dwindled in importance; even treatments that had been found effective in the past were relegated to the realms of old-fashioned folk medicine.\n\nHeroic medicine does not have a definitive start date, as its treatments themselves were not new to the field of medicine. Bloodletting, purging, and sweating are cemented firmly in medical tradition back to the advent of humoral theory in the time of Hippocrates and Galen. With hopes of rebalancing the body's delicate homeostasis of four humors – black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood – the careful manipulation of bodily discharge, like bleeding and evacuation, was believed to nudge the body back to its healthy, natural state. The physician's role was always to monitor the path of the body's humoral levels back to normal.\n\nHeroic medicine takes this methodology to the extreme, draining significant volumes of blood and ordering intensive regimens of evacuation. It was not uncommon for physicians to strive to drain up to 80 percent of a patient's blood volume. Likewise, dramatic evacuations, both by pharmacological emetics and laxatives, induced the forceful removal of bodily fluid. Commonly used emetics include senna and tartar emetic. General intestinal cleansing was instigated by massive doses of calomel, to the point of acute mercury poisoning. Sweating was also induced using blisters of cantharidin and diaphoretic.\n\nHeroic medicine became less favoured with the rise of safer placebos such as hydrotherapy and homeopathy. Even during its heyday, heroic medicine faced criticism from physicians and alternative medicine healers, who pushed for more natural cures.\n\nWhile it is easy to discuss and question the ethical implications of such a severe course of treatment, it is important to remember that in that time period physicians were operating under their best understanding of the body and its physiology. There were dissenting voices at the time, but heroic medicine remained an important, legitimate part of the medical tradition in that era.\n\n"}

At the state level, however, policies regarding the medical and recreational use of cannabis vary greatly, and in many states conflict significantly with federal law.\n\nThe medical use of cannabis is legal (with a doctor's recommendation) in 33 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico. Fourteen other states have laws that limit THC content, for the purpose of allowing access to products that are rich in cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis.

They are alleged to be pressured to leave by adult men to reduce competition for wives within such sects, usually when they are between the ages of 13 and 21.\n\nSince birth rates for boys and girls are roughly equal, and women do not enter the community in large numbers, the pool of available women is not sufficient for all men to have multiple wives.\n\nWhile some boys leave by their own choice, many have been banished for conduct such as watching a movie, watching television, playing football, or talking to a girl. Some boys are told not to return unless they can return with a wife. A 2005 article estimated that between 400 and 1,000 boys and young men had been pressured to leave for such reasons. Many young women also have left or been pressured to leave because they did not want to be part of polygamous marriages.\n\nBoys in these sects are commonly raised not to trust the outside world, and that leaving their communities is a sin worse than murder. With little education or skills applicable to life outside of their community of birth, they must learn to live in a society they inherently distrust yet know little, while dealing with the consequences of being shunned by their families, and believing they are beyond spiritual redemption. The families of banished boys are told that the boys are now dead to them. Some individuals, such as Dan Fischer, a dentist who left the FLDS church, work to help young men who have left or who have been ejected from polygamist organizations in cities like Hildale, Utah, or Colorado City, Arizona.\n\nIn the HBO television series \"Big Love\" (2006-2011), the main protagonist is a former lost boy, having grown up challenging the elder who drove him out of their community as a teenager. The series portrays machinations of some senior men within a fundamentalist congregation to \"reserve\" young unmarried women for themselves.\n\nThe documentary film \"Sons of Perdition\" (2010) depicts the struggles of three real-life lost boys.\n\nThe off-Broadway play \"Exit 27\" (2013) dramatized the story of four lost boys struggling to survive in the desert outside Colorado City.

They are a community of inland fishermen found in Western Assam. A few are also found in the Sylhet District of Bangladesh. It should be worth mentioned that the \"Maimal\" were there in Shylhet district in the undivided India, and after the Independence some parts of that Shylhet district were merged with the state of Assam in free India. Now, this community people are spreading more or less everywhere in the Barak Valley districts in Assam.\n\nAccording to the traditions of the community, the word Maimal is a corruption of the Persian word mahi, which means a fisherman. The Maimal are said to have converted to Islam at the hands of the famous Sufi saint of western Assam, Hazrat Shah Jalal. They are found along the banks of the Sonai and Barak rivers. The community are found mainly in the districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi, and speak the Sylhet dialect of Bengali.\n\nThe Maimal were a community of inland fishermen, but most are now settled agriculturists. They are mainly marginal farmers, growing paddy and vegetables. A small number of Maimal have taken petty trade. The Maimal live in multi-ethnic villages, occupying their own quarters, referred to as paras. They are strictly endogamous, and marry close kin. Historically, the community practised village exogamy, but this is no longer the case.\n\nTraditionally, the maimals are localised on the banks and nearby areas of rivers and other natural water bodies owing to their customary occupation of fishing. So, roads and other means of modern communications lack in their villages.Even there are some village like Kalachori par where water remain at least for 6-month.the flood damage all paddy fields, there is no communication system, No road, no electricity, And percentage of literacy is 1%.The government is not taking any step and the leader people like Gaon panchayat is sucking all the money and the community is going backward day by day.\n\nOn the socio-economic front also, they are legging behind the other communities due to their illiteracy and backwardness in education. Due to all-round backwardness, they have been the easy prey in the clutches of the so-called high caste people.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, in an attempt to emancipate this downtrodden community from the curse of socio-economic backwardness some great leaders of this community like Morhum Maulana Mumtaj uddin, Morhum Maulana Shahid Ahmed(popularly known as Raipuri sahib),Mr.Sarkum Ali (Master of Krishnapur, Hailakandi) Morhum Maulana Shamsul Islam, Morhum Foyez uddin(Master saheb of Tinghori-Bihara), Morhum Haji Sayeed Ali of Srikoan(Cachar), and few others, formed an organisation called Nikhil Cachar Muslim Fishermen Federation, with an area of operation of the then Cachar District i.e., present Barak Valley districts of State of Assam (India). This organisation led the society to give a socio – political identity and was successful to obtain the Other Backward Classes status for the maimals.

Malaysian Chinese tend to perceive the Mandarin Chinese is a variation of Standard Mandarin (Putonghua); however, it is a Mandarin dialect in its own right. Its closest linguistic cousin is not Standard Mandarin, rather it is Singaporean Mandarin, the variety widely used in films like , Namewee's \"Nasi Lemak 2.0\" and movies created by Singaporean movie director Jack Neo. \n\nMalaysian Mandarin speakers seldom translate local terms or names to Mandarin when they speak. They would prefer to verbally use Malay place name in its original Malay pronunciation, for instance, even though the street name \"Jalan Bukit Kepong\" is written as \"惹兰武吉甲洞\" (\"rělán wǔjí jiǎdòng\") in local Chinese printed media, the local Chinese almost never use \"rělán wǔjí jiǎdòng\" in daily conversations. There are exceptions, for example Taiping, since this name is derived from the Chinese language, when people mention this place when speaking local Mandarin, they always use its Mandarin pronunciation, \"Tàipíng\", instead of using its Malay pronunciation, which is closer to \"Taipeng\". Another examples is when a place's Chinese translation varied vastly with its native Malay name, for example: for Teluk Intan, Seremban and Kota Kinabalu, they are preferably referred respectively as \"Ānsùn\" (安順) (which refers to \"Teluk Anson\", Teluk Intan's former colonial name), \"Fúróng\" (芙蓉) and \"Yàbì\" (亞庇).\n\nIn comparison with Chinese, Taiwanese or even Singaporean Mandarin, Malaysian Mandarin is clearly distinguished by its relatively tonally 'flat' sound as well as its extensive use of glottal stops and the \"checked tone\". This results in a distinct \"clipped\" sound compared to other forms of Mandarin.\n\nAs of 2014 93% of ethnic Chinese families in Malaysia speak varieties of Chinese, which includes Mandarin.\n\n\nThe majority of ethnic Chinese people living in Malaysia came from China during the Ming and Qing dynasties, between the 15th and early 20th centuries. Earlier immigrants married Malays and assimilated to a larger extent than later waves of migrants - they form a distinct sub-ethnic group, known as the Peranakans and their descendants speak Malay.\n\nThe majority of immigrants were speakers of Hokkien (Min Nan), Cantonese, Hakka, Teochew, and Hainanese. In the 19th century, Qing immigrants to Malaya had no single common language and were mostly uneducated peasants, and they tended to cluster themselves according to the ethno-linguistic group, usually corresponding to their place of origin, and worked with relatives and other speakers of the same language. In 1879, according to Isabella Bird, a visitor to the tin mining boomtown of Taiping, Perak, \"five dialects of Chinese are spoken, and Chinamen constantly communicate with each other in Malay, because they can't understand each other's Chinese\". \n\nThe Chinese languages spoken in Malaysia have over the years become localized (e.g. Penang Hokkien), as is apparent from the use of Malay and English loan words. Words from other Chinese languages are also injected, depending on the educational and cultural background of the speaker (see Education in Malaysia and Rojak language). Mandarin in Malaysia has also been localized, as a result of the influence of other Chinese variants spoken in Malaysia, rather than the Malay language. Loan words were discouraged in Mandarin instructions at local Chinese school and was regarded as mispronunciations.\n\n\nVariants of Mandarin Chinese:\n\n"}

Users of the term include adherents of interventionist, mixed economy, and protectionist positions, as well as billionaires such as George Soros, economists such as Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman, and Cornell University historian Edward E. Baptist. George Soros suggests that market fundamentalism includes the belief that the best interests in a given society are achieved by allowing its participants to pursue their own financial self-interest with no restraint or regulatory oversight. Critics claim that in modern society with worldwide conglomerates, or even merely large companies, the individual has no protection against fraud nor harm caused by products that maximize income by imposing externalities on the individual consumer as well as society. Historian Edward E. Baptist contends \"unrestrained domination of market forces can sometimes amplify existing forms of oppression into something more horrific\", such as slavery, and that \"market fundamentalism doesn't always provide the best solution for every economic or social problem\".\n\nAccording to economist John Quiggin, the standard features of economic fundamentalist rhetoric are dogmatic assertions combined with the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist. However, Kozul-Wright states in his book \"The Resistible Rise of Market Fundamentalism\" that \"ineluctability of market forces\" neo-liberals and conservative politicians tend to stress, and their confidence on a chosen policy, rest on a \"mixture of implicit and hidden assumptions, myths about the history of their own countries' economic development, and special interests camouflaged in their rhetoric of general good\".\n\nThe expression \"market fundamentalism\" was popularized by business magnate and philanthropist George Soros in his book \"The Crisis of Global Capitalism\" (1998), in which he writes: \"This idea was called laissez faire in the nineteenth century ... I have found a better name for it: market fundamentalism\".\nP. Sainath believes Jeremy Seabrook, a journalist and campaigner, first used the term. The term was used by John Langmore and John Quiggin in their 1994 book \"Work for All\". See also Jonathan Benthall, 1991.\n\nThe expression is now used by various authors writing on economic topics to signify an allegedly unjustified belief in the ability of markets to solve all problems in a society. The term has been used to criticize groups which are viewed as advocating strongly against \"any\" state regulation and which defend a \"totally\" free market. It is also used to disparage the arguments of the proponents of \"the virtues of radical free-market economics\" or, in Soros' own words, against the \"ideology\" which \"has put financial capital into the driver's seat.\"\n\nJoseph E. Stiglitz used the term in his autobiographical essay in acceptance of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences to criticize some International Monetary Fund policies: \"More broadly, the IMF was advocating a set of policies which is generally referred to alternatively as the Washington consensus, the neo-liberal doctrines, or market fundamentalism, based on an incorrect understanding of economic theory and (what I viewed) as an inadequate interpretation of the historical data.\"\n\nThe sociologists Fred L. Block and Margaret Somers use the label \"because the term conveys the quasi-religious certainty expressed by contemporary advocates of market self-regulation.\"\n\n\n"}

Spoken in ancient times, Hebrew, a member of the Canaanite branch of the Semitic language family, was supplanted as the Jewish vernacular by the western dialect of Aramaic beginning in the third century BCE, though it continued to be used as a liturgical and literary language. It was revived as a spoken language in the 19th and 20th centuries and is the official language of Israel.\n\nModern Hebrew is spoken by about nine million people, counting native, fluent, and non-fluent speakers. Most speakers are citizens of Israel: about five million are Israelis who speak Modern Hebrew as their native language, 1.5 million are immigrants to Israel, 1.5 million are Arab citizens of Israel, whose first language is usually Arabic, and half a million are expatriate Israelis or diaspora Jews living outside Israel.\n\nThe organization that officially directs the development of the Modern Hebrew language, under the law of the State of Israel, is the Academy of the Hebrew Language.\n\nThe most common scholarly term for the language is \"Modern Hebrew\" ( \"ʿivrít ħadašá[h]\"). Most people refer to it simply as \"Hebrew\" ( \"Ivrit\").\n\nThe term \"Modern Hebrew\" has been described as \"somewhat problematic\" as it implies unambiguous periodization from Biblical Hebrew. supported the now widely used term \"Israeli Hebrew\" on the basis that it \"represented the non-chronological nature of Hebrew\". In 1999, Israeli linguist Ghil'ad Zuckermann proposed the term \"Israeli\" to represent the multiple origins of the language.\n\nOne can divide the history of the Hebrew language into four major periods:\n\n\nJewish contemporary sources describe Hebrew flourishing as a spoken language in the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, during about 1200 to 586 BCE. Scholars debate the degree to which Hebrew remained a spoken vernacular following the Babylonian captivity, when Old Aramaic became the predominant international language in the region.\n\nHebrew died out as a vernacular language somewhere between 200 and 400 CE, declining after the Bar Kokhba revolt of 132–136 CE, which devastated the population of Judea. After the exile Hebrew became restricted to liturgical use.\n\nHebrew had been spoken at various times and for a number of purposes throughout the Diaspora, and during the Old Yishuv it had developed into a spoken lingua franca among the Jews of Palestine. Eliezer Ben-Yehuda then led a revival of the Hebrew language as a mother tongue in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Modern Hebrew used Biblical Hebrew morphemes, Mishnaic spelling, and Sephardic pronunciation. Many idioms and calques were made from Yiddish. Its acceptance by the early Jewish immigrants to Ottoman Palestine was primarily due to support from the organisations of Edmond James de Rothschild in the 1880s and the official status it received in the 1922 constitution of the British Mandate for Palestine. Jews from Arab lands introduced many loanwords from Arabic (e.g. \"na'ana\", \"zaatar\", \"mishmish\", \"kusbara\", \"ḥilba\", \"lubiya\", \"hummus\", \"gezer\", \"rayḥan\", etc.). The words \"gerev\" (sing.) / \"garbayim\" (pl.) are now applied to \"socks,\" a diminutive of the Arabic \"ğuwārib\" (\"socks\"). Ben-Yehuda codified and planned Modern Hebrew using 8,000 words from the Bible and 20,000 words from rabbinical commentaries. He also invented some words, such as \"ḥatzilīm\" for eggplants (aubergines) and \"ḥashmal\" for electricity. As no Hebrew equivalent could be found for the names of certain produce endemic to the New World, they devised new Hebrew words for maize and tomato, calling them \"tiras\" (Heb. תירס) and \"ʿagḇaniyyah\" (Heb. עגבניה), respectively. The latter word is derived from the shape of the vegetable, which resembled a buttocks (Heb. \"ʿagaḇīm\"). Sometimes, old Hebrew words took on different meanings altogether. For example, the Hebrew word \"kǝvīš\" (), which now denotes a \"street\" or a \"road,\" is actually an Aramaic adjective meaning \"trodden down; blazoned\", rather than a common noun. It was originally used to describe \"a \"blazoned\" trail.\"\n\nOne of the phenomena seen with the revival of the Hebrew language is that, occasionally, old meanings of words were changed for altogether different meanings, such as \"bardelas\" (), which in Mishnaic Hebrew meant \"hyena\", but in Modern Hebrew now means \"cheetah;\" or \"shezīph\" () which is now used for \"plum,\" but formerly meant \"jujube.\" The word \"kishū’īm\" (formerly \"cucumbers\") is now applied to a variety of summer squash (Cucurbita pepo var. cylindrica), a plant native to the New World.\n\nFor a simple comparison between the Sephardic and Yemenite versions of Mishnaic Hebrew, see Yemenite Hebrew.\n\nModern Hebrew is classified as an Afroasiatic language of the Semitic family and the Canaanite branch of the North-West semitic subgroup. While Modern Hebrew is largely based on Mishnaic and Biblical Hebrew as well as Sephardi and Ashkenazi liturgical and literary tradition from the Medieval and Haskalah eras and retains its Semitic character in its morphology and in much of its syntax, the consensus among scholars is that Modern Hebrew represents a fundamentally new linguistic system, not directly continuing any previous linguistic state, being a koiné language based on historical layers of Hebrew, as well as incorporating foreign elements, mainly those introduced during the most critical revival period between 1880 and 1920, as well as new elements created by speakers through natural linguistic evolution. A minority of scholars argue that the revived language had been so influenced by various substrate languages that it is genealogically a hybrid with Indo-European. These theories have not been met with general acceptance, and the consensus among a majority of scholars is that Modern Hebrew, despite non-Semitic influences, can correctly be classified as a Semitic language.\n\nModern Hebrew is written from right to left using the Hebrew alphabet, which is an abjad, or consonant-only script of 22 letters based on the \"square\" letter form, known as \"Ashurit\" (Assyrian), which was developed from the Aramaic script. A cursive script is used in handwriting. When necessary, vowels are indicated by diacritic marks above or below the letters known as \"Nikkud\", or by use of \"Matres lectionis\", which are consonantal letters used as vowels. Further diacritics like Dagesh and Sin and Shin dots are used to indicate variations in the pronunciation of the consonants (e.g. \"bet\"/\"vet\", \"shin\"/\"sin\"). The letters \", \", \"\", each modified with a Geresh, represent the consonants , , . may also be written as \"תש\" and \"טש\". is represented interchangeably by a simple vav \"ו\", non-standard double vav \"וו\" and sometimes by non-standard geresh modified vav \"ו׳\".\n\nModern Hebrew has fewer phonemes than Biblical Hebrew but it has developed its own phonological complexity. Israeli Hebrew has 25 to 27 consonants and 5 to 10 vowels, depending on the speaker and the analysis.\n\nThe following table lists the consonant phonemes of Israeli Hebrew in IPA transcription:\n\nObstruents often assimilate in voicing: voiceless obstruents () become voiced () when they appear immediately before voiced obstruents, and vice versa.\n\nHebrew has five basic vowel phonemes:\n\nLong vowels occur unpredictably where two identical vowels were historically separated by a pharyngeal or glottal consonant, and the first was stressed.\nAny of the five short vowels may be realized as a schwa when far from lexical stress.\nThere are two diphthongs, and .\n\nMost lexical words have lexical stress on one of the last two syllables, of which the last syllable is the more frequent in formal speech. Loanwords may have stress on the antepenultimate syllable or even further back.\n\nWhile the pronunciation of Modern Hebrew is based on Sephardi Hebrew, the pronunciation has been affected by the immigrant communities that have settled in Israel in the past century and there has been a general coalescing of speech patterns. The pharyngeal [] for the phoneme \"chet\" () of Sephardi Hebrew has merged into [] which Sephardi Hebrew only used for fricative \"chaf\" (). The pronunciation of the phoneme \"ayin\" (), has merged with the pronunciation of \"aleph\" () which is either [] or unrealized [∅] and has come to dominate Modern Hebrew; in many variations of liturgical Sephardi Hebrew, it is [], a voiced pharyngeal fricative. The letter \"vav\" () is realized as [], which is standard for both Ashkenazi and most variations of Sephardi Hebrew. The Jews of Iraq, Aleppo, Yemen and some parts of North Africa pronounced \"vav\" as []. Yemenite Jews, during their liturgical readings in the synagogues, will still make use of the older pronunciation of this Hebrew letter. The pronunciation of the letter \"resh\" () has also largely shifted from Sephardi [] to either [] or [].\n\nModern Hebrew morphology (formation, structure, and interrelationship of words in a language) is essentially Biblical. Modern Hebrew showcases much of the inflectional morphology of the classical upon which it was based. In the formation of new words, all verbs and the majority of nouns and adjectives are formed by the classically Semitic devices of triconsonantal roots (\"shoresh\") with affixed patterns (\"mishkal\"). Mishnaic attributive patterns are often used to create nouns, and Classical patterns are often used to create adjectives. Blended words are created by merging two bound stems or parts of words.\n\nThe syntax of Modern Hebrew is mainly Mishnaic, while also showing the influence of different contact languages to which its speakers have been exposed during the revival period and over the past century.\n\nThe word order of Modern Hebrew is predominately SVO (subject–verb–object). Biblical Hebrew was originally verb–subject–object (VSO), but drifted into SVO. Modern Hebrew maintains classical syntactic properties associated with VSO languages—it is prepositional rather than postpositional in making case and adverbial relations, auxiliary verbs precede main verbs; main verbs precede their complements, and noun modifiers (adjectives, determiners other than the definite article , and noun adjuncts) follow the head noun, hence in genitive constructions the possessee noun precedes the possessor. Moreover, Modern Hebrew allows and in cases requires sentences with a predicate initial.\n\nModern Hebrew has expanded its vocabulary effectively to meet the needs of casual vernacular, of science and technology, of journalism and belles-lettres. According to Ghil'ad Zuckermann:\n\nModern Hebrew has loanwords from Arabic (both from the local Levantine dialect and from the dialects of Jewish immigrants from Arab countries), Aramaic, Yiddish, Judaeo-Spanish, German, Polish, Russian, English and other languages. Simultaneously, Israeli Hebrew makes use of words that were originally loanwords from the languages of surrounding nations from ancient times: Canaanite languages as well as Akkadian. Mishnaic Hebrew borrowed many nouns from Aramaic, as well as some from Greek. In the Middle Ages, liturgical Hebrew borrowed heavily from Spanish, Greek, and Arabic. Some typical examples of Hebrew loanwords are:\n\n\n"}

He was a disciple and the successor of Bhagavan Nityananda. He wrote a number of books on the subjects of Kundalini Shakti, Vedanta, and Kashmir Shaivism, including a spiritual autobiography entitled \"The Play of Consciousness\". In honorific style, he is often referred to as \"Swami Muktananda\".\n\nMuktananda was born in 1908 near Mangalore in Karnataka State, India, to a well-off family. His birth name was Krishna Rai. \n\nAt age 15 he encountered Bhagavan Nityananda, a wandering avadhoot who profoundly changed his life. After this encounter, Krishna left home and began his search for the experience of God. He studied under Siddharudha Swami at Hubli, where he learned Sanskrit, Vedanta, all branches of yoga, and took the initiation of sannyasa in the Sarasvati order of the Dashanami Sampradaya, taking the name of Swami Muktananda. After Siddharudha's death, Muktananda then left to study with a disciple of Siddharudha called Muppinarya Swami at his Sri Airani Holematt in Ranebennur Haveri District after studying there Swami Muktananda began wandering India on foot, studying with many different saints and gurus.\n\nIn 1947 Muktananda went to Ganeshpuri to receive the darshan of Bhagavan Nityananda, the saint who had originally inspired Muktananda's search for God. He received shaktipat initiation from him at 15 August of that year. Muktananda often said that his spiritual journey didn't truly begin until he received shaktipat from the holy man Bhagavan Nityananda. According to his description, it was a profound and sublime experience. Muktananda spent the next nine years living and meditating in a little hut in Yeola. He wrote about his sadhana and kundalini-related meditation experiences, in his autobiography. \n\nIn 1956, Bhagawan Nityananda acknowledged the culmination of Muktananda's spiritual journey, and gave him a small piece of land at Ganeshpuri, near Bombay, instructing Muktananda to create an ashram there. The same year he started teaching his \"Siddha Yoga\" path. Between 1970 and 1981, Muktananda went on three world tours, establishing Siddha Yoga ashrams and meditation centers in many countries. In 1975, he founded the Siddha Yoga Ashram in Oakland, in the California Bay area, and in 1979 he established Shree Nityananda Ashram (now Shree Muktananda Ashram) in the Catskills Mountains, northwest of New York City. Muktananda established Gurudev Siddha Peeth as a public trust in India to administer the work there, and founded the SYDA Foundation in the United States to administer the global work of Siddha Yoga meditation. He wrote many books; sixteen are still kept in print by the SYDA Foundation.\n\nIn May 1982, Muktananda appointed two successors as joint leaders of the Siddha Yoga path, Swami Chidvilasananda and her younger brother, Swami Nityananda who later resigned and formed his own group. Muktananda died in October 1982 and is buried at Ganeshpuri, where the Gurudev Siddha Peeth ashram houses his samādhi shrine.\n\nIn 1983, after Muktananda's death, William Rodarmor printed several accusations of physical and sexual abuse, in \"CoEvolution Quarterly\", from anonymous female devotees that Muktananda regularly had sex with them. He also charged that Muktananda had engaged in other behaviour at odds with wider societal norms. These allegations were confirmed by other \"CoEvolution Quarterly\" journalists, while Lis Harris repeated and extended Rodarmor's allegations in an article in \"The New Yorker\" (1994). Lola Williamson notes that Muktananda \"publicly stressed the value of celibacy for making progress on the spiritual path, but he almost certainly violated his own rules.\"\n\nSarah Caldwell argued that Muktananda was both an enlightened spiritual teacher and a practitioner of Shakta Tantrism, but also \"engaged in actions that were not ethical, legal or liberatory with many disciples.\"\n\nCentral to his teachings were to \"See God in each other,\" and \"Honor your Self. Worship your Self. Meditate on your Self. God dwells within you as you.\" Muktananda often gave a shorter version of this teaching: \"God dwells within you as you.\"\n\nAccording to Lola Williamson, Muktananda was known as a \"shaktipat guru because kundalini awakening occurred so readily in his presence\". Through \"Shaktipat Intensives\" participants were said to receive shaktipat initiation, the awakening of Kundalini Shakti that is said to reside within a person, and to deepen their practice of Siddha Yoga meditation. Historically, Shaktipat initiation had been reserved for the few who had done many years of spiritual service and practices; Muktananda offered this initiation to newcomers and yogis alike. There are several published accounts that describe the reception of \"shaktipat\" from Muktananda. Paul Zweig wrote one such account of receiving \"shaktipat\" from Muktananda. In Gurus of Modern Yoga, Andrea Jain, in her chapter on Muktananda, quotes an anonymous source, who describes his moment of shaktipat, when he was 19 years old, conferred by Muktananda with a wand of peacock feathers in 1975:\n\n\n"}

From the physical appearance of the body, skull, skin color (dark brown), and hair (curly or wavy) it appears that the aboriginal Muna people are closer to the tribes of Polynesians and Melanesians in the Pacific and Australia compared to the Buginese or Malays. This is evident by the similarities of the people and their culture with of those in the East Nusa Tenggara, and the islands of Timor and Flores generally. Woven sarong motifs found in East Nusa Tenggara and Muna Island share similar features such as horizontal lines with basic colors of yellow, green, red, and black. The shape of their headwear also has a resemblance to each other. Since before until today, Muna fishermen often harvest sea cucumbers and go fishing up to the waters of Darwin, Australia in the Timor Sea. This has caused Muna fishermen to have been arrested several times in these waters by the Australian government. These habits may probably indicate the existence of a traditional relationship between the Muna people with Aboriginal Australians.\n\nTraditional kite flying of the Muna people is called the \"Kaghati Kolope\" (Kolope leaf kite), as it is made from Dioscorea hispida leaf. It is thought that the \"kaghati kolope\" were used by the farmers as a means of entertainment while looking after their field. Apart from that, it is believed that the \"kaghati kolope\" will transform into an umbrella to protect its owner from the sun in the afterlife.\n\nIn Muna community, there is a circle of life ceremony for each individuals that begins from the ceremony of birth up to the ceremony of death. In order to perform the ceremony, the individual is required to go through each stages. One of the stages is the advancement of childhood to adulthood, especially for women, and the ceremony is called \"Karia\" and for the Butonese people it's called \"Pusuo\".\n\nThe \"Karia\" ceremony is a very important ceremony in the context of traditional customary throughout the life of the individual in Muna society. Karia ceremony is an initiation ritual performed for every woman to be secluded before entering adulthood and marriage. According to the understanding of the Muna society, that a woman should not be married if she has not undergone the process of \"Karia\" ceremony. If violated, the woman will feel excluded and will be ostracized within their own community.\n\n\"Kasambu\" is a tradition passed down for generations held by the community of the Muna people in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. This tradition is a form of thanksgiving for the safety of the wife who will be giving birth to her child. This tradition is usually held before the birth of the child, usually in the 7th or 8th month. For the first seven months of the pregnancy, both husband and wife will bathe together. The \"Kasambu\" procession begins with a couple of husband and wife feeding each other. Once fed, it has to be eaten once or finish; if unless the food is not finished, then the rest is given to the children that are present around them. Children that are participating is usually taken from close relatives. The act of feeding one another is then continued by the rest of the family members of the husband and wife. The expressed meaning of this procession came is to bring together both the families of the husband and wife. While the implied meaning of the procession acts as a vehicle to introduce the unborn child to the circle of family that the child will soon be raised into. The purpose of the ceremony is to bring well wishes and blessings for the unborn child as well as for the safety of both the mother and child in delivery. The procession is ended with a prayer for good wishes by a person of religious position, priest or imam.\n"}
{"id": "37689148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37689148", "title": "Neuroscience of sex differences", "text": "Neuroscience of sex differences\n\nNeuroscience of sex differences is the study of understanding the characteristics of the brain that separate the male brain and the female brain. Psychological sex differences are thought by some to reflect the interaction of genes, hormones and social learning on brain development throughout the lifespan.\n\nSome evidence from brain morphology and function studies indicates that male and female brains cannot always be assumed to be identical from either a structural or functional perspective, and some brain structures are sexually dimorphic.\n\nIdeas of differences in the male and female brain circulated during the time of ancient Greek philosophers around 850 B.C. Aristotle claimed that males did not \"receive their soul\" until 40 days post-gestation and females did not until 80 days. In 1854, Emil Huschke discovered that \"the frontal lobe in the male is all of 1% larger than that of the female.\" As the 19th century progressed, scientists began researching sexual dimorphisms in the brain significantly more. Until around 21 years ago, scientists knew of several structural sexual dimorphisms of the brain, but they did not think that sex had any impact on how the human brain performs daily tasks. Through molecular, animal, and neuroimaging studies, a great deal of information regarding the differences between male and female brains and how much they differ in regards to both structure and function has been uncovered.\n\nFemales show enhanced information recall compared to males. This may be due to the fact that females have a more intricate evaluation of risk-scenario contemplation, based on a prefrontal cortical control of the amygdala. For example, the ability to recall information better than males most likely originated from sexual selective pressures on females during competition with other females in mate selection. Recognition of social cues was an advantageous characteristic because it ultimately maximized offspring and was therefore selected for during evolution.\n\nOxytocin is a hormone that induces contraction of the uterus and lactation in mammals. It is also a characteristic hormone of nursing mothers. Studies have found that oxytocin improves spatial memory. Through activation of the MAP kinase pathway, oxytocin plays a role in the enhancement of long-term synaptic plasticity, which is a change in strength between two neurons over a synapse that lasts for minutes or longer, and long-term memory. This hormone may have helped mothers remember the location of distant food sources so they could better nurture their offspring.\n\nA popular theory regarding language functions suggests that women use both hemispheres more equally, whereas men are more strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere; however a 2008 meta-analysis of 29 studies comparing language lateralization in males and females found no overall difference.\n\nA 2016 meta-analysis found that the amygdala is not significantly larger in either sex. A 2008 meta-analysis of fMRI studies of amygdala activation found larger effect sizes in men compared with women.\n\nAmygdala volume correlates positively with fearfulness in girls but not in boys.\n\nIn fMRI studies, women display stronger activation in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex than men.\n\nA 2016 meta-analysis found that the hippocampus does not differ in volume between men and women.\n\nThere are sex differences in locus coeruleus dendritic structure that allow for an increased reception and processing of limbic information in females compared to males.\n\nAggressive and defiant behavior is also associated with decreased right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volume in boys.\n\nIn a 2013 meta-analysis, researchers found on average males had larger grey matter (GM) volume in bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, anterior parahippocampal gyri, posterior cingulate gyri, precuneus, putamen and temporal poles, areas in the left posterior and anterior cingulate gyri, and areas in the cerebellum bilateral VIIb, VIIIa and Crus I lobes, left VI and right Crus II lobes. On the other hand, females on average had larger grey matter volume at the right frontal pole, inferior and middle frontal gyri, pars triangularis, planum temporale/parietal operculum, anterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and Heschl's gyrus; bilateral thalami and precuneus; the left parahippocampal gyrus and lateral occipital cortex (superior division). The meta-analysis found larger volumes in females were most pronounced in areas in the right hemisphere related to language in addition to several limbic structures such as the right insular cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus.\n\nA 2014 meta-analysis found that although men and women commonly used the same brain networks for working memory, specific regions were sex specific. For example, both men and women's active working memory networks composed of bilateral middle frontal gyri, left cingulate gyrus, right precuneus, left inferior and superior parietal lobes, right claustrum, and left middle temporal gyrus but women also tended have consistent activity in the limbic regions such as the anterior cingulate, bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus while men tended to have a distributed networks spread out among the cerebellum, portions of the superior parietal lobe, the left insula and bilateral thalamus.\n\nA 2017 review from the perspective of large-scale brain networks, hypothesized that women's higher susceptibility to stress-prone diseases like PTSD and major depressive disorder, in which the salience network is theorized to be overactive and to interfere with the executive control network, may be due in part (along with societal exposure to stressors and the coping strategies that are available to women) to underlying sex-based brain differences.\n\nSteroid hormones have several effects on brain development as well as maintenance of homeostasis throughout adulthood. One effect they exhibit is on the hypothalamus, where they increase synapse formation. Estrogen receptors have been found in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, indicating the estrogen plays a role in brain development.  Gonadal hormone receptors have also been found in the basal fore-brain nuclei.\n\nEstradiol influences cognitive function, specifically by enhancing learning and memory in a dose-sensitive manner. Too much estrogen can have negative effects by weakening performance of learned tasks as well as hindering performance of memory tasks; this can result in females exhibiting poorer performance of such tasks when compared to males.\n\nIt has been suggested that during development, estrogen can exhibit both feminizing and defeminizing effects on the human brain; high levels of estrogen induce male neural traits to develop while moderate levels induce female traits. In females, defeminizing effects are resisted because of the presence of α-fetoprotein (AFP), a carrier protein proposed to transport estrogen into brain cells, allowing the female brain to properly develop. The role of AFP is significant at crucial stages of development, however. Prenatally, AFP blocks estrogen. Postnatally, AFP decreases to ineffective levels; therefore, it is probable that estrogen exhibits its effects on female brain development postnatally.\n\nOvariectomies, surgeries inducing menopause, or natural menopause cause fluctuating and decreased estrogen levels in women. This in turn can \"attenuate the effects\" of endogenous opioid peptides. Opioid peptides are known to play a role in emotion and motivation. β-endorphin (β-EP), an endogenous opioid peptide, content has been found to decrease (in varying amounts/brain region), post ovariectomy, in female rats within the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and pituitary gland. Such a change in β-EP levels could be the cause of mood swings, behavioral disturbances, and hot flashes in post menopausal women.\n\nTestosterone heavily influences male development; a study found that perinatal females introduced to elevated testosterone levels exhibited male behavior patterns. In the absence of testosterone, female behavior is retained.\nTestosterone's influence on the brain is caused by organizational developmental effects. It has been shown to influence proaptotic proteins so that they increase neuronal cell death in certain brain regions. Another way testosterone affects brain development is by aiding in the construction of the \"limbic hypothalamic neural networks\".\n\nOxytocin is positively correlated with maternal behaviours, social recognition, social contact, sexual behaviour and pair bonding. Oxytocin appears at higher levels in women than in men. Vasopressin on the other hand is more present in men and mediates sexual behavior, aggression and other social functions.\n\nIt was once thought that sex differences in cognitive task and problem solving did not occur until puberty. However, as of 2000 evidence suggested that cognitive and skill differences are present earlier in development. For example, researchers have found that three- and four-year-old boys were better at targeting and at mentally rotating figures within a clock face than girls of the same age were. Prepubescent girls, however, excelled at recalling lists of words. These sex differences in cognition correspond to patterns of ability rather than overall intelligence. Laboratory settings are used to systematically study the sexual dimorphism in problem solving task performed by adults.\n\nOn average, males excel relative to females at certain spatial tasks. Specifically, males have an advantage in tests that require the mental rotation or manipulation of an object. In a computer simulation of a maze task, males completed the task faster and with fewer errors than their female counterparts. Additionally, males have displayed higher accuracy in tests of targeted motor skills, such as guiding projectiles. Males are also faster on reaction time and finger tapping tests.\n\nOn average, females excel relative to males on tests that measure recollection. They have an advantage on processing speed involving letters, digits and rapid naming tasks. Females tend to have better object location memory and verbal memory. They also perform better at verbal learning. Females have better performance at matching items and precision tasks, such as placing pegs into designated holes. In maze and path completion tasks, males learn the goal route in fewer trials than females, but females remember more of the landmarks presented. This shows that females use landmarks in everyday situations to orient themselves more than males. Females are better at remembering whether objects had switched places or not.\n"}

The multicultural country of Nicaragua experienced an excessive outpouring of citizens who fled the nation for their own security. Although many Nicaraguans live in Spain, Mexico and Panama, the majority of Nicaraguans living abroad are in Costa Rica, the United States and El Salvador. Nicaragua has the second largest number in Central America (after El Salvador) of people living abroad, almost 1,200,000. \n\nAccording to the Pew Hispanic Center, in 2007 there were 306,438 Nicaraguans in the United States.

However, this number is believed to be higher because there were thousands of undocumented immigrants at that time. Probably there are at least 500,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica, including illegals.

{"id": "4128582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4128582", "title": "Paraiyar", "text": "Paraiyar\n\nParaiyar or Parayar (formerly anglicised as Pariah and Paree) is a caste group found in Sri Lanka and the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. They are also known as Adi Dravida (\"Ancient Dravidians\"), which was a title encouraged by the British Raj as a substitute for \"Paraiyar\" because the British believed that their colonising of the country had ended slavery in India.\n\nThe 2001 Census of India reported that in Tamil Nadu the Adi Dravida population was 5,402,755 and the Paraiyar population was 1,860,519, giving a total of 7,263,274. The combined total was 11.63 percent of the state's population. They are numerically the largest Scheduled Caste in Tamil Nadu, accounting for about 59 per cent of the total.\n\nRobert Caldwell and several other writers derive the name of the community from the Tamil word \"parai\" (\"drum\"). According to this hypothesis, the Paraiyars were originally a community of drummers who performed during flood time, war, auspicious events like festivals, weddings and also funerals. As their population increased, they were forced to take up occupations that were considered unclean, such as burial of corpses and scavenging. Because of this, they came to be considered as an untouchable caste. M. Srinivasa Aiyangar finds this etymology unsatisfactory, arguing that beating of drums could not have been an occupation of a large number of people. Some other writers, such as Gustav Solomon Oppert, derive the name from \"poraian\", the name of a regional subdivision mentioned by ancient Tamil grammarians.\n\nThe Sangam literature ( 300 BCE–300 CE) contains references to the caste system of Tamil culture, which contained certain \"low-born\" groups referred to as \"Pulaiyar\". They were believed to be associated with magical power and kept at a distance, made to live in separate hamlets outside villages. However, their magical power was believed to sustain the king, who had the ability to transform it into auspicious power. Thus the \"pulaiyar\" performed a ritual function by composing and singing songs in the king's favour and beating drums. They were divided into subgroups based on the instruments they played. George L. Hart believes that one of the drums called \"kiṇai\" later came to be called \"paṟai\" and the people that played the drum were \"paṟaiyar\" (plural of \"paṟaiyan\").\n\nThe earliest extant reference to the term Paraiyar (as an occupational term for drummers) occurs in a poem by the Sangam poet Mangudi Kilar (2nd century CE). But the earliest mention of the term as a caste does not occur until the reign of Rajaraja Chola (11th century CE). From this period onwards, the word occurs in different contexts in the various pre-British sources:\n\nBurton Stein describes an essentially continuous process of expansion of the nuclear areas of the caste society into forest and upland areas of tribal and warrior people, and their integration into the caste society at the lowest levels. Many of the forest groups were incorporated as Paraiyar either by association with the parai drum or by integration into the low-status labouring groups who were generically called Paraiyar. Thus, it is thought that Paraiyar came to have many subcastes.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement ( 7th–9th centuries CE), the saints - Shaivite Nayanars and the Vaishnavite Alvars - contained one saint each from the untouchable communities. The Nayanar saint Nandanar was born, according to \"Periya Puranam\", in a \"threshold of the huts covered with strips of leather\", with mango trees from whose branches were hung drums. \"In this abode of the people of the lowest caste (\"kadainar\"), there arose a man with a feeling of true devotion to the feet of Siva.\" Nandanar was described as a temple servant and leather worker, who supplied straps for drums and gut-string for stringed instruments used in the Chidambaram temple, but he was himself not allowed to enter the temple. The Paraiyar regard Nandanar as one of their own caste.\n\nScholars such as Burchett and Moffatt state that the Bhakti devotationalism did not undermine Brahmin ritual dominance. Instead, it might have strengthened it by warding off challenges from Jainism and Buddhism.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the Paraiyars had a degraded status in the Tamil society. Francis Buchanan's report on socio-economic condition of South Indians described them (\"Pariar\") as inferior caste slaves, who cultivated the lands held by Brahmins. This report largely shaped the perceptions of the British officials about the contemporary society. They regarded Pariyars as an outcaste, untouchable community. In the second half of the 19th century, there were frequent descriptions of the Paraiyars in official documents and reformist tracts as being \"disinherited sons of the earth\". The first reference to the idea may be that written by Francis Whyte Ellis in 1818, where he writes that the Paraiyars \"affect to consider themselves as the real proprietors of the soil\". In 1894, William Goudie, a Weslyan missionary, said that the Paraiyars were self-evidently the \"disinherited children of the soil\". English officials such as Ellis believed that the Paraiyars were serfs toiling under a system of bonded labour that resembled the European villeinage. However, scholars such as Burton Stein argue that the agricultural bondage in the Tamil society was different from the contemporary British ideas of slavery.\n\nHistorians such as David Washbrook have argued that the socio-economic status of the Paraiyars rose greatly in the 18th century during the Company rule in India; Washbrook calls it the \"Golden Age of the Pariah\". Raj Sekhar Basu disagrees with this narrative, although he agrees that there were \"certain important economic developments\".\n\nThe Church Mission Society converted a large number of Paraiyars to Christianity by the early 19th century. During the British Raj, the missionary schools and colleges admitted Paraiyar students amid opposition from the upper-caste students. In 1893, the colonial government sanctioned an additional stipend for the Paraiyar students. The colonial officials, scholars and missionaries attempted to rewrite the history of the Paraiyars, characterising them as a community that enjoyed a high status in the past. Edgar Thurston (1855-1935), for example, claimed that their status was nearly equal to that of the Brahmins in the past. H. A. Stuart, in his Census Report of 1891, claimed that Valluvans were a priestly class among the Paraiyars, and served as priests during Pallava reign. Robert Caldwell, J. H. A. Tremenheere and Edward Jewitt Robinson claimed that the ancient poet-philosopher Thiruvalluvar was a Paraiyar.\n\nIyothee Thass, a Siddha doctor by occupation, belonged to a Paraiyar elite. In 1892, he demanded access for Paraiyars to Hindu temples, but faced resistance from upper-caste Brahmins and Vellalars. This experience led him to believe that it was impossible to emancipate the community within the Hindu fold. In 1893, he also rejected Christianity and Islam as the alternatives to Hinduism, because caste differences had persisted among Indian Christians, while the backwardness of contemporary local Muslims made Islam unappealing.\n\nThass subsequently attempted a Buddhist reconstruction of the Tamil religious history. He argued that the Paraiyars were originally followers of Buddhism and constituted the original population of India. According to him, the Brahmanical invaders from Persia defeated them and destroyed Buddhism in southern India; as a result, the Paraiyars lost their culture, religion, wealth and status in the society and become destitute. In 1898, Thass and a large number of his followers converted to Buddhism and founded the Sakya Buddha Society (\"cākkaiya putta caṅkam\") with the influential mediation of Henry Steel Olcott of the Theosophical Society. Olcott subsequently and greatly supported the Tamil Paraiyar Buddhists.\n\nIyothee Thass felt that \"Paraiyar\" was a slur, and campaigned against its usage. During the 1881 census of India, he requested the government to record the community members under the name \"Aboriginal Tamils\". He later suggested \"Dravidian\" as an alternative term, and formed the Dhraavidar Mahajana Sabhai (Dravidian Mahajana Assembly) in 1891. Another Paraiyar leader, Rettamalai Srinivasan, however, advocated using the term \"Paraiyar\" with pride. In 1892, he formed the Parayar Mahajana Sabha (Paraiyar Mahajana Assembly), and also started a news publication titled \"Paraiyan\".\n\nThass continued his campaign against the term, and petitioned the government to discontinue its usage, demanding punishment for those who used the term. He incorrectly claimed that the term \"Paraiyar\" was not found in any ancient records (it has been, in fact, found in the 10th century Chola stone inscriptions from Kolar district). Thass subsequently advocated the term \"Adi Dravida\" (\"Original Dravidians\") to describe the community. In 1892, he used the term \"Adidravida Jana Sabhai\" to describe an organisation, which was probably Srinivasan's Parayar Mahajana Sabha. In 1895, he established the People’s Assembly of Urdravidians (Adidravida Jana Sabha), which probably split off from Srinivasan's organisation. According to Michael Bergunder, Thass was thus the first person to introduce the concept of \"Adi Dravida\" into political discussion.\n\nAnother Paraiyar leader, M. C. Rajah — a Madras councillor — made successful efforts for adoption of the term \"Adi-Dravidar\" in the government records. In 1914, the Madras Legislative Council passed a resolution that officially censured the usage of the term \"Paraiyar\" to refer to a specific community, and recommended \"Adi Dravidar\" as an alternative. In the 1920s and 1930s, Periyar E. V. Ramasamy ensured the wider dissemination of the term \"Adi Dravida\".\n\nParaiyars belong to the \"Valangai\" (\"Right-hand caste faction\"). Some of them assume the title \"Valangamattan\" (\"people of the right-hand division\"). The \"Valangai\" comprised castes with an agricultural basis while the \"Idangai\" consisted of castes involved in manufacturing. \"Valangai\", which was better organised politically.\n\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n"}

According to the public opinion, the lure has always been the annual financial bonus from UEFA for the participating teams in the UEFA Champions League.\n\nWith the method of telephone tapping, Makis Triantafyllopoulos, a TV journalist, trapped a conversation between Thomas Mitropoulos (invisible owner of Egaleo F.C. and at the same time \"advisor of Olympiakos on arbitration matters\") and a referee (Spathas), saying \"...we don't care about the others, we only want Olympiakos win, only Olympiakos and Egaleo, fuck all others...\" and referring to Kokkalis as \"the Uncle\". The journalist involved also the president then of the Hellenic Football Federation, Vassilis Gagatsis.\n\nAfter the taking of Olympiakos' leadership by Evangelos Marinakis, new scandals came in the light, such as the Koriopolis scandal. In one of the recorded conversations, Olympiacos Volou' chairman Achilleas Beos asks protection for the referees (Kalopoulos, Tryfonas) from Evangelos Marinakis, after a controversial winning game of Olympiakos against Panathinaikos on 21 February 2011. In February 2012, the Superleague Greece with the agreement of the Hellenic Football Federation achieved the replacement of the two football prosecutors (Fakos, Antonakakis) with two others (Petropoulos, Karras). The investigation had no progress.\n\nIn 1999, after a derby match between Olympiacos F.C. and A.E.K. Athens F.C., Demis Nikolaidis and other AEK players decided to abstain from the Greece national football team as a protest for the arbitration. They revoked in 2001 after the coming of Otto Rehhagel as manager.\n\nIn 2004, the ex-manager of Egaleo FC, Stéphane Demol, stated that the reason he was sacked from the team was because he didn't agree with the president on match-fixing.\n\nIn 2008, referee Dimitris Pontikis stated that indeed there was among the referees a group that favoured Olympiacos F.C., in exchange for a better career.\n\nOn 21 February 2011, after a controversial derby match between Olympiakos and Panathinaikos F.C. (referee Kalopoulos), Panathinaikos striker Djibril Cissé had an wrangle with Evangelos Marinakis and stated he would abandon Superleague Greece because of the arbitration.\n\nWith the break out of the Koriopolis scandal, appeals to the Greek Justice were made by some politicians, such as the ministers Yiannis Kourakis and Giorgos Floridis, who stated that \"a gang controls the referees from the background\". In 2011, minister Pavlos Geroulanos called the Greek football \"totally corrupted\". The whole judicial process had no result. At the time, UEFA officials said no action was presently being considered against Olympiakos regarding its participation in the Champions League of the following season.\n\nIn August 2014, new elements came in the light by the National Intelligence Service involving Marinakis, Giorgos Sarris (president of the Hellenic Football Federation) and other football officers, referees and judges in the establishment of a \"criminal organisation\". Also, Marinakis is appearing to be behind the attack to the bakery shop of Konstantineas and behind attacks to referees (Giorgos Daloukas, Dimitris Kyrkos etc.), journalists and others.\n\nIn September 2014, Olivier Kapo, ex-player of Levadiakos F.C., stated in French media that \"in Greek football everything is corrupted, mafia-controlled, while FIFA and UEFA simply don't care\".\n\nIn November 2014, the Chief Refereeing Officer Hugh Dallas criticized the arbitration of Ilias Spathas, after a match of Olympiacos, as the \"worst he has ever seen\" saying that the mistakes were not normal.

Resource mobilization advocates having the right type of resource, at the right time, at right price with making right use of acquired resources thus ensuring optimum utilization of the same.\n\nIt is a major sociological theory in the study of social movements which emerged in the 1970s. It emphasizes the ability of a movement's members to 1) acquire resources and to 2) mobilize people towards accomplishing the movement's goals. In contrast to the traditional collective behaviour theory that views social movements as deviant and irrational, resource mobilization sees them as rational social institutions, created and populated by social actors with a goal of taking political action.\n\nAccording to resource mobilization theory, a core, professional group in a social movement organization works towards bringing money, supporters, attention of the media, alliances with those in power, and refining the organizational structure. The theory revolves around the central notion of how messages of social change are spread from person to person and group to group. The conditions needed for a social movement are the notion that grievances shared by multiple individuals and organizations, ideologies about social causes and how to go about reducing those grievances.\n\nThis theory assumes that individuals are rational: individuals weigh the costs and benefits of movement participation and act only if benefits outweigh costs. When movement goals take the form of public goods, the free rider dilemma has to be taken into consideration.\n\nSocial movements are goal-oriented, but organization is more important than resources. Organization means the interactions and relations between social movement organizations (SMOs) and other organizations (other SMOs, businesses, governments, etc.). Efficiency of the organization infrastructure is a key resource in itself.\n\nResource mobilization theory can be divided into two camps:\n\nThe entrepreneurial model explains collective action as a result of economics factors and organization theory. It argues that grievances are not sufficient to explain creation of social movements. Instead access to and control over resources is the crucial factor. The laws of supply and demand explain the flow of resources to and from the movements, and that individual actions (or lack thereof) is accounted for by rational choice theory.\n\nThe political model focuses on the political struggle instead of economic factors.\n\nIn the 1980s, other theories of social movements such as social constructionism and new social movement theory challenged the resource mobilization framework.\n\nEdwards and McCarthy identified five types of resources available to social movement organizations\n\n\nCritics point out that resource mobilization theory fails to explain social movement communities, which are large networks of individuals and other groups surrounding social movement organizations, and providing them with various services. Critics also argue that it fails to explain how groups with limited resources can succeed in bringing social change and that it does not assign sufficient weight to grievances, identity, and culture as well as many macro-sociological issues.\n\nAldon Morris claims that the resource mobilization theory is a possible explanation of the surge of the civil rights movement in the United States. The rise of this movements was not because African Americans felt at the same time a frustration which lead to a rebellion, Instead, it was the mobilization and organization of the African American leaders the trigger of the civil rights movement. Some of the leaders Aldon Morris reframed are Rosa Parks and Marthin Luther King Jr. who combined with the efforts of the NAACP, the SCLC, the SNCC, CORE as well as small business, labor unions, students' organizations and faith communities lead to the civil rights movement. These organizations together mobilized vast resources instead of doing it individually leading to massive mobilization of people fighting for the same objective. The research done by Aldon Morris demonstrates that social movements depend on the ability of empower the less powerful people; \"the civil rights movement managed, against overwhelming odds and historical tradition, to push for reform of oppressive and rigidly racist cultural repertoires, practices and laws that had denied African Americans basic civil rights\".\n\nMoveOn.org is a social movement organization to which resource mobilization theory can apply because it is a platform for people to either sign a petition or start a new petition. Coupled with political process theory, a social movement theory which posits that social movements either succeed or fail due to political opportunities, MoveOn.org has been a successful tool because of its accessibility, which would make people more likely to start a petition and move toward a common goal. In other words, resource mobilization applies to MoveOn.org because 1) the website itself is an existing resource that is accessible to consumers of the Internet which helps mobilize the goals of the organization and 2) that mobilization is essential to MoveOn.org's success. Also, resource mobilization applies because of the fact that the people who founded the organization knew how to utilize the resources available, which implies that anyone who uses the website to sign a petition or start a petition are rational social actors who act as utility maximizers, who weigh the costs and benefits before deciding to be a part of a social movement.\n\nThe Arab Spring is another example. Born in Tunisia in December 2010, growing unrest spread through Egypt, Syria, and Yemen. Researchers studying resource mobilization through the Egyptian Revolution during the Arab Spring found a reliance on social media to spread social action messages while the governments worked to censor the media and cut off those countries from the rest of the world by severing the internet. The activists in those countries were communicating with each other through social media platforms like Twitter to coordinate protests, keep tabs on each other and spread the social change messages. The researchers noted the Egyptian Revolution demonstrated the use of social media to rapidly spread messages of social change and mobilized large groups of people. Another group of researchers studying social movements in Tunisia during the Arab Spring found cyber activism sprang from grievances about increasing government restrictions on Internet use for political purposes coupled with lack of socioeconomic opportunities.\n\nResource mobilization theory has been studied in conjunction with other fields, such as framing theory. Evidence has been found of an evolving relationship between framing processes and social movements. This relationship has led to the identification of two frames used in social movement stories: diagnostic, which involves identifying the sources of causality or blame for the situation, and prognostic, which lays out a plan of attack on how to create social change.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "342998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342998", "title": "Winged Victory of Samothrace", "text": "Winged Victory of Samothrace\n\nThe Winged Victory of Samothrace, also called the Nike of Samothrace, is a marble Hellenistic sculpture of Nike (the Greek goddess of victory), that was created about the 2nd century BC. Since 1884, it has been prominently displayed at the Louvre and is one of the most celebrated sculptures in the world. H.W. Janson described it as \"the greatest masterpiece of Hellenistic sculpture\", and it is one of a small number of major Hellenistic statues surviving in the original, rather than Roman copies.\n\nThe context of the \"Winged Victory of Samothrace\", discovered in 1863, is controversial, with proposals ranging from the Battle of Salamis in 306 BC to the Battle of Actium in 31 BC as the event being celebrated. Datings based on stylistic evaluation have been equally variable, ranging across the same three centuries, but perhaps tending to an earlier date. For much of the 20th century, the prevailing theory, based on the works of Hermann Thiersch and Karl Lehmann, considered it a Rhodian monument dedicated following the victories at Side and Myonessos in 190 BC, and suggested that it might have been carved by the Rhodian sculptor Pythocritus. However, in recent years, the reconstructions of the monument proposed by Lehmann have been shown to be false (the remains of the surrounding space that housed the \"Victory\" belong to the Roman period), and the question of why the statue was dedicated on Samothrace, which at the time was dominated by the Greek Kingdom of Macedonia, remains unanswered.\n\nThe statue is high. It was created not only to honor the goddess, Nike, but also to honor a sea battle. It conveys a sense of action and triumph as well as portraying artful flowing drapery, as though the goddess were descending to alight upon the prow of a ship.\n\nModern excavations suggest that the \"Victory\" occupied a niche above a theater and also suggest it accompanied an altar that was within view of the ship monument of Demetrius I Poliorcetes (337–283 BC). Rendered in grey and white Thasian and Parian marble, the figure originally formed part of the Samothrace temple complex dedicated to the Great gods, \"Megaloi Theoi\". It stood on a rostral pedestal of gray marble from Lartos representing the prow of a ship (most likely a trihemiolia), and represents the goddess as she descends from the skies to the triumphant fleet. Before she lost her arms, which have never been recovered, Nike's right arm is believed to have been raised, cupped round her mouth to deliver the shout of Victory. The work is notable for its convincing rendering of a pose where violent motion and sudden stillness meet, for its graceful balance and for the rendering of the figure's draped garments, compellingly depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze. Similar traits can be seen in the \"Laocoön group\" which is a reworked copy of a lost original that was likely close both in time and place of origin to Nike, but while \"Laocoon\", vastly admired by Renaissance and classicist artists, has come to be seen as a more self-conscious and contrived work, \"Nike of Samothrace\" is seen as an iconic depiction of triumphant spirit and of the divine momentarily coming face to face with man.\n\nThe statue’s outstretched right wing is a symmetric plaster version of the original left one. The stylistic portrayal of the wings is a source of scholarly discussion, as the feather pattern resembles neither the wings of birds in nature nor wings in Greek art. As with the arms, the figure's head has never been found, but various other fragments have since been found: in 1950, a team led by Karl Lehmann unearthed the missing right hand of the Louvre's \"Winged Victory\". The fingerless hand had slid out of sight under a large rock, near where the statue had originally stood; on the return trip home, Dr Phyllis Williams Lehmann identified the tip of the Goddess's ring finger and her thumb in a storage drawer at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, where the second \"Winged Victory\" is displayed; the fragments have been reunited with the hand, which is now in a glass case in the Louvre next to the podium on which the statue stands.\n\nThe different degree of finishing of the sides has led scholars to think that it was intended to be seen from three-quarters on the left.\n\nA partial inscription on the base of the statue includes the word \"Rhodios\" (Rhodian), indicating that the statue was commissioned to celebrate a naval victory by Rhodes, at that time the most powerful maritime state in the Aegean which in itself would date the statue to 288 BC at the earliest.\n\nThe sculptor is unknown, although Paul MacKendrick suggests that Pythokritos of Lindos is responsible. When first discovered on the island of Samothrace (then part of the Ottoman Empire and called \"Semadirek\") and published in 1863, it was suggested that the \"Victory\" was erected by the Macedonian general Demetrius Poliorcetes after his naval victory at Cyprus, between 295 and 289 BC. The Archaeological Museum of Samothrace continues to follow these originally established provenance and dates. Ceramic evidence discovered in recent excavations has revealed that the pedestal was set up about 200 BC, though some scholars still date it as early as 250 BC or as late as 180. Certainly, the parallels with figures and drapery from the Pergamon Altar (dated about 170 BC) seem strong. The evidence for a Rhodian commission of the statue has been questioned, however, and the closest artistic parallel to the Nike of Samothrace are figures depicted on Macedonian coins. Samothrace was an important sanctuary for the Hellenistic Macedonian kings. The most likely battle commemorated by this monument is, perhaps, the Battle of Cos in 255 BC, in which Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedonia won over the fleet of Ptolemy II of Egypt.\n\nIn April 1863, the \"Victory\" was discovered by the then French consul in Adrianopolis and amateur archaeologist Charles Champoiseau (1830-1909), who sent it to Paris in the same year. The statue has been reassembled in stages since its discovery. The prow was reconstructed from marble debris at the site by Champoiseau in 1879 and assembled in situ before being shipped to Paris.\n\nAfter 1884, the statue was positioned where it would visually dominate the Daru staircase. Since 1883, the marble figure has been displayed in the Louvre, while a plaster replica stands in the museum at the original location of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods on Samothrace.\n\nIn the autumn of 1939, the Winged Victory was removed from her perch in anticipation of the outbreak of World War II. All the museums of Paris were closed on August 25. Artwork and objects were packed for removal to locations deemed more safe outside Paris for safekeeping. On the night of September 3, the statue descended the staircase on a wooden ramp which was constructed across the steps. During the years of World War II, the statue sheltered in safety in the Château de Valençay along with the \"Venus de Milo\" and Michelangelo's \"Slaves\".\n\nThe discovery in 1948 of the hand raised in salute, which matched a fragment in Vienna, established the modern reconstruction—without trumpet—of the hand raised in epiphanic greeting.\n\nIn 2013 a restoration effort was launched to improve the appearance of the sculpture. This was the first detailed examination of the individual pieces of the sculpture to date. The restoration aimed to restore the marble to its original hue which had been tarnished by time. The sculpture was removed from its base and carried into an adjoining room which was transformed for the occasion into a restoration workshop. The base was dismantled block by block and placed in the workshop. Scientific reviews were performed on the base (UV, Infrared, X-ray spectroscopy) prior to cleaning the surface of the marble. This effort aimed to respect the goals of the original restoration performed in 1883. The surface of the base was cleaned and then reassembled, and some gaps in the marble were repaired. Upon completion of the restoration, the statue was reunited with its base and returned to its prior position at the head of the Daru staircase in the Louvre.\n\nDespite its significant damage and incompleteness, the \"Victory\" is held to be one of the great surviving masterpieces of sculpture from the Hellenistic Period, and from the entire Greco-Roman era. The statue shows a mastery of form and movement which has impressed critics and artists since its discovery. It is considered one of the Louvre's greatest treasures, and since the late 19th century it has been displayed in the most dramatic fashion, at the head of the sweeping Daru staircase.\n\nThe art historian H. W. Janson has pointed out that unlike earlier Greek or Near Eastern sculptures, \"Nike\" creates a deliberate relationship to the imaginary space around the goddess. The wind that has carried her and which she is fighting off, straining to keep steady – as mentioned the original mounting had her standing on a ship's prow, just having landed – is the invisible complement of the figure and the viewer is made to imagine it. At the same time, this expanded space heightens the symbolic force of the work; the wind and the sea are suggested as metaphors of struggle, destiny and divine help or grace. This kind of interplay between a statue and the space conjured up would become a common device in baroque and romantic art, about two thousand years later. It is present in Michelangelo's sculpture of \"David\": David's gaze and pose shows where he is seeing his adversary Goliath and his awareness of the moment – but it is rare in ancient art.\n\nThe \"Victory\" soon became a cultural icon to which artists responded in many different ways. For example, Abbott Handerson Thayer's \"A Virgin\" (1892–93) is a well-known painted allusion. When Filippo Tommaso Marinetti issued his Futurist Manifesto in 1909, he chose to contrast his movement with the supposedly defunct artistic sentiments of the Winged Victory: \"a race-automobile which seems to rush over exploding powder is more beautiful than the 'Victory of Samothrace.\n\nThe 1913 sculpture \"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\" by the Futuristic sculptor Umberto Boccioni, currently located at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, was influenced by the statue, and is said to bear an underlying resemblance to it.\n\nOn February 3, 1999, according to the Macedonian Press Agency: News in English, \"residents of the Aegean island of Samothrace, the birthplace of the renowned Greek sculpture Nike of Samothrace, aka the Winged Victory, embarked on a letter-writing campaign to have this finest extant of Hellenistic sculpture returned to their homeland.\nIn a letter signed by the island's mayor, the locals urged Greek politicians to intervene and request that the Louvre museum, where the statue is kept, acknowledge that the sculpture belongs in its natural environment.\"\n\nThe Greek Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs asked again for its return in 2013.\n\nNumerous copies exist in museums and galleries around the world; one of the best-known copies stands outside the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas. The first FIFA World Cup trophy, commissioned in 1930 and designed by Abel Lafleur, was based on the model.\n\nThis statue was a favorite of Frank Lloyd Wright and he used reproductions of it in a number of his buildings, including Ward Willits House, Darwin D. Martin House and Storer House.\n\nThe largest public sculpture based on Nike appears in a prominent position atop the massive Pennsylvania State Memorial at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia sculptor Samuel Murray, a student and intimate of painter Thomas Eakins, produced the 28-foot figure in 1911 with possible influence from Augustus Saint-Gaudens' Nike interpretation on the Sherman Memorial in New York City (1903). Saint-Gaudens depicts Nike with her right arm raised while it is thought the original Nike was not making such gesture. Saint-Gaudens' Nike also wears a laurel wreath on her head and bears a large olive branch in her left hand. Murray adapted the laurel wreath and olive branch innovations but also placed a sword in Nike's raised right hand.\n\nStarting in 1962, Yves Klein produced a series of plaster replicas of the \"Nike\" coated in dry pigment of his signature International Klein Blue affixed by resin entitled \"Victoire de Samatrace\".\n\nSwedish author Gunnar Ekelöf made \"Nike\" a central image in his poem \"Samothrace\", written in 1941, where the faceless deity, arms outstretched like sails, is made into a symbol of the fight and the coming victory against Nazism and the struggle for freedom throughout history. It also features in the Matthew Reilly novel \"Seven Ancient Wonders\", where it is fictionally made part of the Statue of Zeus at Olympia.\n\nA full-size replica of the statue sits in The Ohio State University's Thompson Library in Columbus, Ohio. Another full size replica stands in the lobby of Crouse College, home to the Setnor School of Music, at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. A replica of the sculpture stands at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut. The second-largest replica of this statue in the United States stands at Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is high.\n\nTexas Woman's University in Denton, Texas has a replica which was purchased from the Louvre and shipped from Paris in 1982. This replica is actually a replacement of the original 1929 replica given to commemorate Armistice Day and the defeat of autocracy. A replica of the statue sits overlooking the Veterans area of the Skylawn Memorial Park in San Mateo, California.\n\nThe Estrugamou Building in Buenos Aires, Argentina was built in four sections, arranged around a patio adorned with a bronze copy of the iconic Winged Victory of Samothrace. The Cape Town Cenotaph is topped by a replica of the Winged Victory of Samothrace by British sculptor Vernon March. Another plaster replica adorns the atrium of Technische Universität Berlin. The replica was a gift by French universities to the TU Berlin in 1956.\n\nAugustus Saint-Gaudens' 1903 equestrian statue of General William Tecumseh Sherman in Grand Army Plaza, New York City, depicts a robed, winged Nike leading Sherman while holding a palm branch, as a symbol of his victory in the Civil War and the peace to follow.\n\nGraffiti artist Banksy created \"CCTV Angel\" in 2006 depicting a robed, winged figure with a CCTV camera for a head, as a statement on the overreach with security surveillance in society.\n\n\n\n"}

The involvement of women in writing occurred in several early civilizations.\n\nOne of the earliest known female writer was Enheduanna, whom also is the earliest known poet whose name has been recorded. She was the High Priestess of the goddess Inanna and the moon god Nanna (Sin). She lived in the Sumerian city-state of Ur.\n\nEnheduanna's contributions to Sumerian literature, definitively ascribed to her, include several personal devotions to Inanna and a collection of hymns known as the \"Sumerian Temple Hymns\". Further additional texts are ascribed to her. This makes her the first named author in world history.\n\nShe was the first known woman to hold the title of EN, a role of great political importance that was often held by royal daughters. She was appointed to the role by her father, King Sargon of Akkad. Her mother was probably Queen Tashlultum. \nEnheduanna was appointed to the role of High Priestess in a shrewd political move by Sargon to help secure power in the south of his kingdom, where the City of Ur was located.\n\nSappho (; Aeolic Greek \"Psapphô\"; c. 630 – c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by a lyre. Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has survived only in fragmentary form, except for one complete poem: the \"Ode to Aphrodite\". As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho's style.\n\nChristine de Pizan was the most know late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote \"Book of the City of Ladies\" in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as Anastasia, who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.\n\nOn of most know 18th century female writer was Jane Austen author of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1816), she achieved success as a published writer.
