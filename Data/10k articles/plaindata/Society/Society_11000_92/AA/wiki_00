{"id": "2340459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340459", "title": "Allochtoon", "text": "Allochtoon\n\nAllochtoon (plural: allochtonen) is a Dutch word (from Greek ἀλλόχθων, from ἄλλος [\"allos\"] other and χθών [\"chthōn\"] soil/earth/land), literally meaning \"emerging from another soil\". It is the opposite of the word \"autochtoon\" (in English \"autochthonous\" or \"autochthon\"; from Greek αὐτόχθων, from αὐτός [\"autos\"] self/same and again χθών [chthōn] soil/earth/land), literally meaning \"emerging from this soil\".\n\nIn the Netherlands (and Flanders), the term \"allochtoon\" was widely used to refer to immigrants and their descendants. Officially the term \"allochtoon\" was much more specific and referred to anyone who had at least one parent born outside the Netherlands. The antonym \"autochtoon\" was less widely used, but it roughly corresponded to \"ethnic Dutch\". Among a number of immigrant groups living in the Netherlands, a \"Dutch\" person (though they are themselves Dutch citizens) usually refers to the ethnic Dutch.\n\nIn 1950, Dutch descent, Dutch nationality, and Dutch citizenship were in practice identical. Dutch society consisted mostly of ethnic Dutch, with some colonial influences and sizeable minorities of German and Flemish heritage. In 1950, most Dutch were either Catholic or Protestant, with some atheists. Decolonisation and immigration from the 1960s on altered the ethnic and religious composition of the country. This development has made the 'ethnicity' and national identity of the Dutch a political issue.\n\nDutch nationality law is based primarily on the principle of jus sanguinis (\"right of blood\"). In other words, citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Dutch parent, irrespective of place of birth.\n\nThe Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS) used the definition that at least one of the parents is not born in the Netherlands.\n\nA first distinction was made between first-generation and second-generation newcomers.\nNote that someone who was born abroad, but with both parents born in the Netherlands, was an \"autochtoon\".\n\nA further distinction was made between \"Western\" and \"non-Western\" \"allochtoon\" people. A non-Western \"allochtoon\" was someone whose 'country of origin' was or lied in Turkey, Africa, Latin America and Asia, with the exception of Indonesia (or the former Dutch East Indies) and Japan.\n\nThis last distinction was made because the official definition of \"allochtoon\" deviated from the common use in popular speech, where people referred to someone as \"allochtoon\" only when that person was an immigrant or an asylum seeker who was clearly distinct in ethnicity, clothing or behaviour from the traditional Dutch society. However, in the official sense, the largest group of \"allochtoon\" people were of German ancestry. The groups that people usually thought of when they heard the word \"allochtoon\" were those of Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Dutch-Antillean ancestry. As of 2006, the first three groups comprise roughly 350,000 people each, together constituting just over 6% of the population. So a new term was introduced that lied closer to that meaning, \"niet-westers \"allochtoon\"\", which excluded \"allochtoon\" people from Europe, Japan (a developed high income country) and Indonesia (a former colony), but not those from the Netherlands Antilles and Suriname, even though the Netherlands Antilles are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and those from Suriname immigrated when that country was still part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This definition coincided better with the popular conception of the word as signifying people of low socio-economic status who are \"different from us\".\n\nAlthough some viewed the usage of \"allochtoon\" as a stigma, several members of the Dutch Royal Family were officially \"allochtoon\" people, as one of the parents was foreign-born. This included 'western-allochtoon' current monarch Willem Alexander, as well as his 'non-western allochtoon' wife Queen Máxima of the Netherlands and their children.\n\nAs of November 1, 2016, the Statistics Netherlands stopped using the terms \"allochtoon\" and \"autochtoon\". Instead, it distinguishes people with a migrant background and people with a Dutch background.\n\nOriginally proposed as a neutral term, the use of the term \"allochtoon\" has been criticized as being stigmatizing. There is a regular stream of newspaper articles reporting statistics that unfavourably distinguish \"allochtoon\" people from the rest of the Dutch.\n\nIn 2013, the city council of Amsterdam decided to stop using the term because of its divisive effect.\n\nAs of 2016, the term \"allochtoon\" is no longer used by the Dutch government.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1276024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1276024", "title": "Armenians of Romania", "text": "Armenians of Romania\n\nArmenians have been present in what is now Romania and Moldova for over a millennium, and have been an important presence as traders since the 14th century. Numbering only in the thousands in modern times, they were culturally suppressed in the Communist era, but have undergone a cultural revival since the Romanian Revolution of 1989.\n\nThe earliest traces of Armenians in what was later Moldavia are dated by 967 (recorded presence in Cetatea Albă). Early Armenian Diasporas stemmed in the fall of the Bagratuni rule and other disasters, including the Mongol invasion. In 1572–1574, Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit was Hospodar (Prince) of Moldavia, grandson of Stephen the Great, son of Bogdan III and his Armenian concubine Serpega.\n\nArmenian expatriates were awarded tax exemptions at different times in the Danubian Principalities' history. Encouraged to settle as early as the 14th century, they became a familiar presence in towns, usually as the main entrepreneurs of the community – for this, in early modern Botoșani and several other places, Armenians as a guild were awarded political representation and degrees of self-rule. A considerable number of noble families in the Principalities were of Armenian descent.\n\nIn Bucharest, an Armenian presence was first recorded in the second half of the 14th century – most likely, immigrants from the Ottoman-ruled Balkans, as well as from the area around Kamianets-Podilskyi and towns in Moldavia; throughout the 19th century, a large part of Armenian Bucharesters had arrived from Rousse, in present-day Bulgaria. The Gregorian Armenians were given the right to build a church around 1638 – it was rebuilt and expanded in 1685, but was damaged by the Russian attack during the 1768–1774 war with the Ottomans.\n\nCitizenship was bestowed on the community only with the decision taken by the international protectorate over the two countries (instituted after the Crimean War and the ensuing Treaty of Paris) to extend civil rights to all religious minorities.\n\nArmenians were present from early on in Transylvania, clearly attested in a document issued by Hungarian King Ladislaus IV the Cuman (late 13th century). Here, they were even allowed to found their own trading towns, the most notable one being Gherla, called \"Armenopolis\"/\"Armenierstadt\" or \"Hayakaghak\" (Հայաքաղաք). The second important Armenian town in Transylvania is Dumbrăveni (Elisabethstadt).\n\nDespite their increasing autonomy, the townspeople's adherence to the Roman Catholic Church was nonetheless demanded (a conversion begun through the efforts of a Botoșani-born prelate, Oxendius Vărzărescu), and further submitted to forced integration by the Habsburg monarchy since the 18th century. The Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania is nowadays centered on Gherla, and is placed under the jurisdiction of the Romanian Roman-Catholic Church archbishops of Alba Iulia.\n\nMost Armenians from Transylvania has been magyarized in the last half of the 19th century.\n\nAfter the Armenian genocide of 1915, Romania was the first state to officially provide political asylum to refugees from the area.\n\nIn 1940 about 40,000 Armenians lived in Romania. Under communist rule, Armenians started to leave the country, and Nicolae Ceaușescu's regime eventually closed all Armenian schools.\n\nThe Armenian Apostolic community has a number of churches and a monastery in Romania. The church is under the jurisdiction of the See of Holy Echmiadzin of the Armenian Apostolic Church. The churches include:\n\nThere is also the Zamca Armenian Apostolic Monastery in Mânăstirea Zamca, Suceava.\n\nArmenian Catholic churches and Parishes belonging to the Armenian Catholic Church include:\n\nSince 1989, there has been an Armenian cultural and political revival in Romania. As of 2002, there were 1,780 Armenians, many of them from mixed families, and the number of native speakers of the Armenian language is 721. There is one Armenian church in Bucharest on what is called \"Strada Armenească\" (\"Armenian Street\"). The origin of the church is from the 17th century. But the wooden building burnt in a fire in 1781. The newer structure was built starting 1911 through the efforts of Armenian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire. The new church opened in 1915. The church is run by bishop Datev Hagopian. The Armenian community exists since almost a thousand years, and the Armenian Apostolic Diocese has a history of at least 600 years.\n\nAlso running is the Hagigadar Monastery established in 1512 with many visitors making it a tourist attraction. The community is celebrating the 500th anniversary of its establishment.\n\nBesides the church is a two-storey cultural center with the first floor being a library of Armenian old and new books and the second floor, a museum. The library was established by literary figure Hagop Sirouni (real family name Jololian). The collection suffered after the Soviet authorities exiled him to Siberia in the 1940s and the collection was confiscated only to be returned to the Armenian community in 1987 after suffering serious losses.\n\nThe origin of the existing Armenian community is basically Western Armenian. But it suffered greatly with the establishment of communist regime, the emigration of many Armenian Romanians back to Soviet Armenia after the Second World War, the immigration waves to the West.\n\nHowever the present community is being reinforced by Eastern Armenians immigrating from Armenia and other countries or by Armenian students coming to study in Romania.\n\nThe community presently publishes the periodicals \"Nor Ghiank\" (in Armenian), \"Ararat\", and the state-sponsored \"Lăcașuri de cult\".\n\nRomanians of Armenian descent have been very active in Romanian political, cultural, academic and social life. Most worthy of mention would be His Holiness Vazgen I, Catholicos of Armenia, and Iacob Zadig, a general in the Romanian Army during World War I.\n\n\n"}

It contains his personal as well as albums information.\n\nEsakhelvi was born in Essa Khail, Mianwali, Punjab Province, Pakistan as Attaullah Khan Niazi. Niazi is a populous Pashtun tribe in Punjab to which Imran Khan and Misbah ul Haq also belong. Attaullah developed an interest in music as a child, but music was strictly forbidden in his home. Despite the restriction on music in his home, Attaullah secretly sought to learn more about music. His school teacher taught him Mohammed Rafi and Mukesh songs and told him never to stop singing. Attaullah tried to explain his passion for music to his parents and convince them to let him sing, but they forbade him to continue singing. Disillusioned, Attaullah left home when he was 18 years old. He traveled extensively within Pakistan and supported himself by working from Mianwali. He is most popular in rural areas of Pakistan and some other countries in world\n\nEsakhelvi continued his training after leaving his parents' home and often recorded himself on cassette tapes that he later distributed.\n\nIn 1972, Esakhelvi was invited to perform on Radio Pakistan, Bahawalpur.

There were stories about his failed love which were doing rounds. While these were all fake, many people in India had taken them to be true. These added to his popularity and at one point of time, he had become almost a cult figure.\n\nAttaullah Khan is from district Mianwali and his hometown is Esakhel.He received his early education from Esakhel. He is traditionally considered as a Seraiki artist.\n\nAttaullah relocated to Lahore after becoming a professional musician performing in Seraiki, Urdu and English.

{"id": "1105940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1105940", "title": "Borjigin", "text": "Borjigin\n\nA Borjigin (; ; ; English plural: Borjigins or Borjigid; <nowiki>[</nowiki>Middle Mongolian plural?<nowiki>]</nowiki>: [term?], translit. \"Borǰigit\"; <nowiki>[</nowiki>Manchu plural?<nowiki>]</nowiki>: ) is a member of the sub-clan, which started with Yesugei (but the \"Secret History of the Mongols\" makes it go back to Yesugei's ancestor Bodonchar), of the Kiyat clan. Yesugei's descendants were thus said to be Kiyat-Borjigin. The senior Borjigid provided ruling princes for Mongolia and Inner Mongolia until the 20th century. The clan formed the ruling class among the Mongols and some other peoples of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Today, the Borjigid are found in most of Mongolia, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, although genetic research has shown that descent from Genghis Khan is common in Central Asia.\n\nThe patrilineage began with Blue-grey Wolf (Börte Chino) and Fallow Doe (Gua Maral). According to \"The Secret History of the Mongols\", their 11th generation descendant Dobu Mergen's widow Alan Gua the Fair was impregnated by a ray of light. Her youngest son became the ancestor of the later Borjigid. He was Bodonchar Munkhag, who along with his brothers sired the entire Mongol nation. According to Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, many of the older Mongolian clans were founded by members of the Borjigin — Barlas, Urud, Manghud, Taichiut, Chonos, Kiyat, etc. The first Khan of the Mongol was Bodonchar Munkhag's great-great-grandson Khaidu Khan. Khaidu's grandsons Khabul Khan and Ambaghai Khan (founder of the Taichiut clan) succeeded him. Thereafter, Khabul's sons, Hotula Khan and Yesugei, and Khabuls grandson Temujin (Genghis Khan, son of Yesugei) ruled the Khamag Mongol. By the unification of the Mongols in 1206, virtually all of Temujin's uncles and first cousins had died, and from then on only the descendants of Yesugei Baghatur formed the Borjigid.\n\nAccording to Paul Pelliot and Louis Hambis, Rashid al-Din Hamadani once explained that \"\"borčïqïn\" designated \"en turc\"\" a man with dark-blue eyes (\"اشهل \"ašhal\"), and did so again without mentioning the said language, adding that Yesugei's children and the majority of their own children had had such eyes per coincidence, also recalling that the genie which had impregnated Alan Gua after her husband's death had had dark-blue eyes (\"ašhal čašm\"\"). Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur later paraphrased Hamadani by relating that Yesugei's eyes were dark-blue (\"شهلا \"šahlā\"), that the Mongols (\"Moɣol\") called such eyes \"borǰïɣïn\" (بورجغن), that his sons and most of their descendants had had dark-blue eyes (\"ašhal\"), and that one recognized thus in Yesugei's lineage the characteristic sign of the genie which had visited Alan Gua and had \"borǰïɣïn\" eyes, adding that the Arabs called \"ašhal\" a man whose iris (\"bübäčik\") was black, cornea white (\"aq\"), and \"la ligne foncée circulaire qui entoure l'iris\"\" red. Paul Pelliot and Louis Hambis have questioned these explanations.\n\nThe Borjigin family ruled over the Mongol Empire from the 13th to 14th century. The rise of Genghis (Chingis) narrowed the scope of the Borjigid-Kiyad clans sharply. This separation was emphasized by the intermarriage of Genghis's descendants with the Barlas, Baarin, Manghud and other branches of the original Borjigid. In the western regions of the Empire, the Jurkin and perhaps other lineages near to Genghis's lineage used the clan name Kiyad but did not share in the privileges of the Genghisids. The Borjigit clan had once dominated large lands stretching from Java to Iran and from Indo-China to Novgorod. In 1335, with the disintegration of the Ilkhanate in Iran, the first of numerous non-Borjigid-Kiyad dynasties appeared. Established by marriage partners of Genghisids, these included the Suldus Chupanids, Jalayirids in the Middle East, the Barulas dynasties in Chagatai Khanate and India, the Manghud and Onggirat dynasties in the Golden Horde and Central Asia, and the Oirats in western Mongolia.\n\nIn 1368, under Toghun Temür, the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Ming dynasty in China but members of the family continued to rule over Mongolia homeland into the 17th century, known as the Northern Yuan dynasty. Descendants of Genghis Khan's brothers, Hasar and Belgutei, surrendered to the Ming in the 1380s. By 1470 the Borjigin lines were severely weakened, and Mongolia was almost in chaos.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Golden Horde, the Khiyat continued to rule the Crimea and Kazan until the late 18th century. They were annexed by the Russian Empire and the Chinese. In Mongolia, the Kublaids reigned as Khagan of the Mongols, however, descendants of Ögedei and Ariq Böke usurped the throne briefly.\n\nUnder Dayan Khan (1480–1517) a broad Borjigid revival reestablished Borjigid supremacy among the Mongols proper. His descendants proliferated to become a new ruling class. The Borjigin clan was the strongest of the 49 Mongol banners from which the Bontoi clan proper supported and fought for their Khan and for their honor. The eastern Khorchins were under the Hasarids, and the Ongnigud, Abagha Mongols were under the Belguteids and Temüge Odchigenids. A fragment of the Hasarids deported to Western Mongolia became the Khoshuts.\n\nThe Qing dynasty respected the Borjigin family and the early emperors married the Hasarid Borjigids of the Khorchin. Even among the pro-Qing Mongols, traces of the alternative tradition survived. Aci Lomi, a banner general, wrote his \"History of the Borjigid Clan\" in 1732–35. The 18th century and 19th century Qing nobility was adorned by the descendants of the early Mongol adherents including the Borjigin.\n\nAsian dynasties descended from Genghis Khan included the Yuan dynasty of China, the Ilkhanids of Persia, the Jochids of the Golden Horde, the Shaybanids of Siberia, and the Astrakhanids of Central Asia. As a rule, the Genghisid descent played a crucial role in Tatar politics. For instance, Mamai had to exercise his authority through a succession of puppet khans but could not assume the title of khan himself because he lacked Genghisid lineage.\n\nThe word \"Chingisid\" derives from the name of the Mongol conqueror Genghis (Chingis) Khan (c. 1162–1227 CE). Genghis and his successors created a vast empire stretching from the Sea of Japan to the Black Sea.\n\n\nBabur and Humayun, founders of the Mughal Empire in India, asserted their authority as Chinggisids. Because they claimed descent through their maternal lineage, they had never used the clan name Borjigin.\n\nThe last ruling monarch of Genghisid ancestry, Maqsud Shah (d. 1930), Khan of Kumul from 1908 to 1930.\n\nGenghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire in 1206. His grandson, Kublai Khan, after defeating his younger brother Ariq Böke, founded the Yuan dynasty in China in 1271. The dynasty was overthrown by the Ming dynasty during the reign of Toghaghan-Temür in 1368, but it survived in Mongolia homeland, known as the Northern Yuan dynasty. Although the kingship was usurped by Esen Taishi of the Oirats in 1453, he was overthrown in the next year. A recovery of the khaganate was achieved by Dayan Khan, but the territory was segmented by his descendants. The last khaan Ligden died in 1634 and his son Ejei Khongor submitted himself to Hong Taiji the next year, ending the Northern Yuan regime. However, the Borjigin nobles continued to rule their subjects until the 20th century under the Qing.\n\nOr in a different version (years of reign over the Northern Yuan dynasty [up to 1388] are given in brackets).\n\nThe Borjigin held power over Mongolia for many centuries (even during Qing period) and only lost power when Communists took control in the 20th century. Aristocratic descent was something to be forgotten in the socialist period. Joseph Stalin's associates executed some 30,000 Mongols including Borjigin nobles in a series of campaigns against their culture and religion. Clan association has lost its practical relevance in the 20th century, but is still considered a matter of honour and pride by many Mongolians. In 1920s the communist regime banned the use of clan names. When the ban was lifted again in 1997, and people were told they had to have surnames, most families had lost knowledge about their clan association. Because of that, a disproportionate number of families registered the most prestigious clan name Borjigin, many of them without historic justification. The label Borjigin is used as a measure of cultural supremacy.\n\nIn Inner Mongolia, the Borjigid or Kiyad name became the basis for many Chinese surnames adopted by ethnic Inner Mongols. The Inner Mongolian Borjigin Taijis took the surname Bao (, from Borjigid) and in Ordos Qi (, Qiyat). A genetic research has proposed that as many as 16 million men from populations as far apart as Hazaras in the West and Hezhe people to the east may have Borjigid-Kiyad ancestry, but the professionalism of that study is being criticised. The Qiyat clan name is still found among the Kazakhs, Uzbeks and Karakalpaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the initial building of the Qing dynasty, the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan had the tradition of diplomatic marriages with Mongols to earn their support. Qing rulers would make Mongol ladies empresses and major concubines. As the Khorchin were the strongest banner, the Manchus were anxious to make alliances from the Borjigit. These marriages produced two empresses and three dowager empresses of the Qing dynasty, from which Xiaozhuang subsequently became a notable grand empress dowager. Hence, it is not surprising to note that from Nurhaci to the Shunzhi Emperor, all the empresses and major concubines were Mongols.\n\nEmpress Xiaoduanwen (Jerjer) was made empress in 1636, Empress of Emperor Hung Taiji. Daughter of Prince Manjusri. Known as a benevolent empress and the most virtuous of all. Made \"Motherly Empress Dowager Empress\" (Mu Hou Huang Tai Hou) in 1643 after the death Of Emperor Hung Taiji. She died in 1649 (Shunzhi's 6th year of rule).\n\nEmpress Dowager Xiaozhuang (Bumbutai) was historically considered the mother of Qing dynasty. She was a concubine of Huang Taiji. Daughter of Prince Jaisang and niece of Empress Xiaoduan. Made the \"Enlightened Mother Dowager Empress\" (Sheng Mu Huang Tai Hou) in 1643 after the death of Emperor Hung Taiji. She died in 1688 having helped Shunzhi Emperor, her son, run the country till his death and Kangxi Emperor, her grandson, for 25 years of his reign. This makes all Qing dynasty emperors who ruled China proper descendants of Genghis Khan. Xiaozhuang was an excellent politician who did not like to interfere in politics, unlike the notorious Empress Dowager Cixi. However, when the conditions required, she rendered her efforts.\n\n\n"}

Conditional death sentences also occurred in the early 1920s. Decrees issued in 1922, 1923 and 1933 provided police with the right to carry out summary executions, but they were repealed in 1959. The death penalty was abolished on 26 May 1947, only to be reinstated in 1950. Capital punishment was extended to cases of first-degree murder in 1954.\n\nIn addition to crimes such as high treason, espionage, terrorism and murder, the capital punishment was imposed for economic crimes, such as \"the pilfering of state or public property in especially large amounts\". The hijacking of a plane became a capital crime in 1973.\n\nCapital punishment for crimes against state and public property was reintroduced in 1961. During the same year, two foreign currency traders, Rokotov and Faibishenko, were retroactively sentenced to death and executed. By 1987, over 6,000 people had been executed for economic crime. The death penalty was generally applied if the crime involved sums exceeding about 150,000 rubles, though there was no fixed threshold.\n\nSeveral officials were executed for economic crimes as part of Yuri Andropov's anti-corruption campaign. Vladimir I. Rytov, a deputy Minister of Fisheries, was executed in 1982 for smuggling millions of dollars worth of caviar to the West. The director of Gastronom 1, one of Moscow's most prominent gourmet food stores, was executed in 1984 for corruption. The chairman of Technopromexport was executed in 1984 for \"systematically taking big bribes\". Bella Borodkina, head of the restaurants and canteens department in Gelendzhik, was sentenced to death for receiving $758,500 in bribes.\n\n"}

The people call themselves \"Acipu\".\n\nLike most Benue–Congo languages, Cipu has a complex noun class system. It has a fairly complex phonology with lexical and grammatical tone, vowel harmony and nasalisation.\n\nVirtually all Cipu speakers speak the lingua franca Hausa. Many also speak other nearby languages.\n\nCipu is part of the Kambari branch of the Niger–Congo languages.\n\nThe most recent published classification has Cipu as part of the Kamuku group of West Kainji along with Eastern Acipa. However more detailed studies have shown this to be unlikely.\n\nThe \"Ethnologue\" currently lists Cipu as 'Western Acipa'. However the name 'Western Acipa' is no longer used outside the \"Ethnologue\", and a request has been made to change the entry. In Hausa, the language is referred to as \"Acipanci\" and the people as \"Acipawa\".\n\nCicipu is spoken in Nigeria by approximately 20,000 people, split between Sakaba Local Government Area, Kebbi State and Kontagora Local Government Area, Niger State.\n\nThe Acipu themselves recognise seven distinct varieties of Cicipu. The dialect names are as follows (with the corresponding Hausa names in brackets):\n\nThe most common syllable type in Cicipu is CV, although there are fairly strong arguments for N and CVN. A small number of noun and verb roots begin with a V syllable. Lexical tone contrasts are found in nouns e.g. \"káayá\" ‘house’ and \"káayà\" ‘bean’, but not in verbs (although grammatical tone is important for verbs).\n\nCicipu has an asymmetric six-vowel system. All vowels can be long or short, and all have nasalised counterparts. There are four diphthongs: /ei/, /eu/, /ai/ and /au/.\n\nConsonant length is contrastive in Cicipu, e.g. \"yuwo\" 'fall' vs. \"yuwwo\" 'turn around'. Any consonant may be lengthened.\n\nA large number of Cicipu words are borrowings from the lingua franca Hausa. The pronunciation of many of these loanwords has changed to fit in with Cicipu phonology, in particular with respect to vowel harmony.\n\nCicipu is not currently written, although a preliminary orthography proposal has been made, and a small number of trial books has been circulated.\n\n\n"}

They were deeply rooted in Egyptian society and the history of the country. For centuries, Circassians have been part of the ruling elite in Egypt, having served in high military, political and social positions. The Circassian presence in Egypt traces back to 1297 when Lajin became Sultan of Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. Under the Burji dynasty, Egypt was ruled by twenty one Circassian sultans from 1382 to 1517. Even after the abolishment of the Mamluk Sultanate, Circassians continued to form much of the administrative class in Egypt Eyalet of Ottoman Empire, Khedivate of Egypt, Sultanate of Egypt and Kingdom of Egypt. Following the Revolution of 1952, their political impact has been relatively decreased.\n\nAlthough many Egyptian Circassians exhibit physical characteristics attributed to their forefathers, those with far-removed Circassian ancestry were assimilated into other local populations over the course of time. With the lack of censuses based on ethnicity, population estimates vary significantly. Mainly of mixed Abaza, Adyghe and Arab origin, the Abaza family is the largest extended family with more than 50,000 members in the country. One of Egypt's richest families, the family has played a long-standing role in Egyptian business life.\n\nCircassians in Egypt have a long history. They arrived in Egypt during the Mamluk and Ottoman era, although a small number migrated as muhajirs in the late 19th century as well. The Circassians in Egypt were very influential from the 13th century. To a certain extent, they shared the same role as their other Circassian brethren who lived in neighbouring Ottoman Turkey; many were importees, deportees, slaves, but also made up many of the notable noble families, while many others were kingmakers, royal consorts, military commanders, soldiers, craftsmen and artists.\n\nCircassians in Egypt are almost exclusively Sunni Muslim.\n\nNotable Egyptians of either partial or full Circassian descent include:\n\n"}

A general culture and awareness of this corruption permeates society as a whole.\n\nA Global Corruption Barometer survey from 2010 found that the institutions seen as most corrupt were the political parties and the parliament, followed by the police and public officials, the judiciary and the military\n\nTransparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index, based on experts' and businesspeople's perceptions of corruption in the public sector, ranks the country 96th out of 180 countries.\n\nVarious factors have contributed to political corruption in Colombia including: drug trafficking, guerrilla and paramilitary conflict, weak surveillance and regulation from institutions, intimidation and harassment of whistle-blowers, and a widespread apathy from society to address unethical behavior.\n\nThe government is continuously taking steps to measure and reduce levels of corruption at all levels through anti-corruption policies. Initiatives have also been headed by the private sector in the interest of facilitating and encouraging business activities.\n\nPractices of corruption that plague politics and the judicial system are, in part, rooted in the colonial legacies of the Spanish conquest. The Spanish Empire was known to possess a disorganised and corrupt bureaucracy, which was transplanted to its colonies, including Colombia. The first courts established by the Spaniards in America were also known to be corrupt and inefficient. For example, Colombia inherited the ineffective and distrusted legal system which fails to guarantee private property rights in order to promote economic investment. One of the primary ways colonial elites could make a fortune was through occupying important positions in the judicial bureaucracy of the colony and thereby capturing rents.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1999, corruption in Colombia is estimated to have cost the state 1% of its GDP annually. In addition to the economic cost of corruption, other aspects of Colombian society have been affected such as the loss of credibility of politicians and the Colombian government, as well as the demoralization and disinterest of society at large in political participation.\n\nRecent studies of criminal behavior in the country indicate that while the rate of crime grew annually about 39.7%, the criminal behavior by officials in local and national government grew 164.1%, and despite this increase there are few convictions. The levels of administrative corruption are so high that as of 2011, the media reports of such felonies overshadow the stories on terrorism or armed conflict.\n\nA 2005 study published by Transparency for Colombia (\"Transparencia por Colombia\") assessed the index of integrity of governments, assemblies, and comptrollers at the departmental level and concluded that none of those dependencies scored an appropriate level of integrity. 51% were prone to high or very high levels of corruption.\n\nColombia's modern corruption takes place mostly at the level of business between politicians and officials with private contractors and companies. The lack of ethical behavior among private individuals or organizations, and politicians has resulted in a culture known in Colombia as \"serrucho\" (saw), in which it is almost the norm for individuals to bribe politicians in order to be granted contracts and for politicians to add commissions and extra costs for their own benefit. Other sources of corruption come from the result of privatization of government owned institutions in which the profits are used by individuals for their own wealth.\n\nAccording to Transparency for Colombia, the country ranks 70 in the Perception of Corruption index. However, the problem of corruption is a high priority to only 2.9% of the people interviewed versus violence, which is a high priority to 31.49%, and unemployment, which is a high priority to 20.7%.\n\nAccording to a study by the Universidad Externado de Colombia, corruption is one of the main factors that render doing business difficult in Colombia. 91% of entrepreneurs consider that some business owners pay bribes. 16.92% say that a businessperson will offer a bribe, and out of the 28.4% of entrepreneurs who were asked for money or favors by a government official, only 8.52% reported it to the authorities in an effective way.\n\nCurrent levels of corruption have increased steadily since 2009 and continue getting worse as the Attorney General and the comptroller discover corruption at almost every level of government, from local to national. In September 2009, 48.000 government officials, including 800 mayors and 30 governors, were being investigated for corruption. The issue of corruption has not been isolated to one political party; accusations of corruption span the political spectrum, from right-wing conservatives in the Party of National Unity to the left-wing Democratic Pole.\n\nThe discouragement of society from addressing the many cases of corruption in Colombia also stems from the well known immunity: only a small percentage of officials investigated for corruption are likely to suffer legal consequences. In addition, it is difficult for the judicial system to handle many investigations at lower levels. At the top, politicians avoid prosecution via political maneuvering and loopholes, sometimes under the protection of their own political party. An example of this is the attempt by the Party of National Unity to pass a bill that would protect its politicians involved in the parapolitics scandal.\n\nColombia's corruption is also the result of a long coexistence between the drug trafficking and a rush of society members to achieve easy wealth, thus rendering every aspect of society vulnerable to corruption, from politics, to agriculture and sports.\n\nMany institutions in Colombia have been the subject of administrative corruption. Examples of large institutions, that span across industries and have been involved in major cases of corruption, include: \"Ferrovias\" (national railroad administration), \"Caprecom\" (health care), \"Foncolpuertos\" (ports authority), \"Termorrio\" (energy), \"Dragacol\" (civil engineering), \"Chivor reservoir\" (water supply), and contracts with foreign companies such as Mexican ICA for the pavement of streets in Bogota.\n\nLevels of corruption at the local level (towns, cities) has been increasing since the 1990 relative to corruption levels at the national scale\n\n\"Colombian corruption scandals\" are often related to the conflict that has affected Colombia for 50 years.\n\n\n\n"}

The ephebe would need to hunt, rely on his senses, on aggression, stealth, and trickery to survive. At the end of the initiation, the ephebe was reincorporated back into society as a man. The idea was that if the community was ever threatened, its men would have these skills needed to protect it.\n\nIn Rome, where the elite (mainly patricians) were often sent to Greece or received Greek teachers, the Greek word was adopted in the Latinate form \"ephebus\" (plural \"ephebi\"), and fixed at the 16 to 20 age bracket.\n\nIn Ancient Greek sculpture, an ephebe is a sculptural type depicting a nude \"ephebos\" (Archaic examples of the type are also often known as the kouros type, or kouroi in the plural). This typological name often occurs in the form \"the \" Ephebe\"\", where is the collection to which the object belongs or belonged, or the site on which it was found (e.g. the \"Agrigento Ephebe\").\n\n\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, in Sindh, whenever the snake charmer brought snakes, they were given some Dakhshina (alms) and also milk for the snakes. The folklore of Gogro is set from Kutch and Gujarat.\n\nIn Thatta, near Pir Pitho, there was a kingdom of king Gopichand. The King’s daughter, Vachhalbai saw a flower flowing in the river. She got the flower with her friend’s help. A saintly person's soul lived in that flower. As Vachhalbai smelled the flower, the soul entered the stomach. After a few months king came to know about pregnancy of his daughter and was also told about the incident.\nHowever, the King knew no one would believe the story. He therefore, asked four of his soldiers to take Vachhalbai in a chariot and leave her in a deserted jungle. One ox was bitten by a snake and the soldiers could not proceed with one only ox.\nAt this point, Vachhalbai heard a voice ementaing from her stomach: \"Mother chant this mantra and sprinkle water on the dead ox.\" Vachhalbai and the soldiers were surprised but they did what they were told, and the ox recovered immediately. The soldiers saluted Vachhaalbai with respect and left her in the deserted place.\n\nOver a period of time Vachhalbai gave birth to a child who was called 'Gogro'. When it cried in hunger, all the snakes used to collect there to feed him turn with their poison. This poison gave strength to the child, who with his power dug up a ditch and produced a spring of water. 'Gogro' used to play with snakes and drunk their poison.\n\nOne day a Rajput king's caravan passed by. The Rajput king was dying of thirst. Gogro gave him water on the condition that he must leave seven boys to live in the jungle. In order to save his life king Chawan left seven boys there.\n\nFeeding the seven boys proved to be difficult. Gogro started taking more poison from the snakes. This created a discontent among the snakes and a small snake 'Han Khanu' was determined to kill Gogro; but it had a very little poison. The great snake Python 'Ajgar' gave poison to him. The Cobra said that it is a sin to kill our master. Further, he said that if Han Khanu killed Gogro, he would devour the han Khanu. Since that time the biggest of snakes - Python has no poison and the cobra wherever it sees Han Khanu devours it.\n\nGogro had such a power that if he turned his eyes to the place where a snake bit, the whole poison evaporated. That is why the Han Khanu bit Gogro on his jaw where Gogro could not see the place. While dying Gogro said to his friends \"When I die you cook me and eat me up.\" His friends cut him in two pieces, cooked him but did not feel like eating. So they threw the full pot in the river. Some thieves got hold of this pot and ate all the pieces. As they realised soul went to their stomach they also become realised souls and their third eye opened up, through which they could see the future. These thieves were called 'Mamooyoon Fakirs'. Many references are made to this by Dr.Gurbaxani in his poems.\n\nMahatam Gogro before he died, told all his friends not to bite the people without a reason and also told the people to consider snakes as their friends.\n"}
{"id": "38467634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38467634", "title": "Grand Lodge of All England", "text": "Grand Lodge of All England\n\nThe Grand Lodge of All England \"Meeting since Time Immemorial in the City of York\" was a body of Freemasons which existed intermittently during the Eighteenth Century, mainly based in the City of York. It does not appear to have been a regulatory body in the usual manner of a masonic Grand Lodge, and as such is seen as a \"Mother Lodge\" like Kilwinning in Scotland. It met to create Freemasons, and as such enabled the foundation of new lodges. For much of its career, it was the only lodge in its own jurisdiction, but even with dependent lodges it continued to function mainly as an ordinary lodge of Freemasons. Having existed since at least 1705 as the \"Ancient Society of Freemasons in the City of York\", it was in 1725, possibly in response to the expansion of the new Grand Lodge in London, that they styled themselves the \"Grand Lodge of All England Meeting at York\". Activity ground to a halt some time in the 1730s, but was revived with renewed vigour in 1761. \n\nIt was during this second period of activity that part of the Lodge of Antiquity, having quit the Grand Lodge of England in London, allied themselves with their Northern brethren and became, between 1779 and 1789, the \"Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent\". Shortly after Antiquity's re-absorption into the London Grand Lodge she had founded, the Grand Lodge at York ceased to function again, this time for good.\n\nAccording to the Halliwell Manuscript, or Regius Poem, probably written in the second quarter of the fifteenth century, the birth of organised English masonry occurred when King Athelstan convened a grand council of the mason's trade. Later manuscripts added detail, and by the time of Queen Elizabeth I the assembly was acknowledged to have occurred in York in 926. It was convened by Athelstan's youngest son, Edwin, who appears in no other history of the period. This is usually referred to as the \"York Legend\", or the \"Legend of the Guild\". The masonic manuscripts known as the Old Charges all retell some version of this legend.\n\nBy the seventeenth century the Old Charges had assumed a standard form. After an introductory prayer or blessing the Seven Liberal Arts are described, and rooted in Geometry. There follows the story of the children of Lamech. His three sons invented masonry, metallurgy and music, and his daughter weaving. Being forewarned of the destruction of the world by fire or flood, they wrote their science on two great pillars, one which would not sink, and the other fireproof. The pillars were rediscovered after the flood, the knowledge passing from Hermes Trismegistus to Nimrod to Abraham, who carried it into Egypt where he taught it to Euclid. Euclid in turn, taught geometry/masonry to the children of the Lords of Egypt, whence it passed back to the children of Israel who in due course used it to build the Temple of Solomon. The diaspora of masons after the completion of the temple led to masonry arriving in the France of Charles Martel, whence it went to England under Saint Alban. The knowledge was lost in the wars after the death of Alban, but at Edwin's assembly at York he gave the masons their charges, and had them bring any writings they had inherited. Manuscripts in many languages were brought, and a book made showing how the craft was founded. The enduring myth of the \"Grand Assembly\" was continued in the first printed constitutions of the eighteenth century, making York the birthplace of English masonry, and allowing the old lodge at York to claim precedence over all the other English Lodges.\n\nRecords of the operative lodge attached to York Minster are written on the \"Fabric rolls of York Minster\" (a record of the erection and maintenance of the \"fabric\" of the building), and extend from 1350 to 1639, when the lodge became irrelevant to the cathedral. Their rules appear under the heading \"Ordinacio Cementariorum\" in the roll from 1370. \n\nYork Lodge has a manuscript constitution dated 1693, so presumably, the lodge is at least that old.\n\nThe oldest, lost portion of the minutes of the speculative lodge commence on 7 March 1705–06. There may at one time have been minutes from 1704. The chief officer was styled President or Master until 1725, when Grand Master was adopted. \n\nSurviving minutes commence on 19 March 1712–13. Until 1725, there seems to have been only one lodge, its meetings termed \"Private\" and \"General\" lodges.\n\nFamilial relations have been traced between the members of the \"Ancient Society of Freemasons in the City of York\", as recorded in 1705, and the operative lodge documented there in 1663. Some sort of organisational continuity is possible. It possessed its own collection of the \"Old Charges\" of the craft, and initiated masons to meet under its jurisdiction in at least two other towns. It assumed the geographical jurisdiction of the old operative \"Grand Lodge North of the River Trent\". Its main meetings occurred twice a year on the feast days of John the Baptist and John the Evangelist. From 1712–1716 there were one or two meetings a year, and from 1717–1721 there were no meetings at all.\n\nDeputations were sent to other towns for the purpose of making masons, Scarborough in 1705, and Bradford in 1713, when eighteen \"gentlemen\" were admitted. Two important old constitutions, the Scarborough and the Hope manuscripts, are attributed to these meetings. The end of the Scarborough MS states that it was certified at Scarborough on 10 July 1705 and is signed by the president and his officers. The end of the Hope MS is missing, thus the attribution is not so certain. The lodge would not again expand outside of York until the 1760s. In 1707, Robert Benson, the Lord Mayor of York, was president. Later, as Lord Bingham, he would become Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nOn 27 December 1725, the feast of St. John the Evangelist, the York lodge claimed the status of a Grand Lodge. The burst of activity, which started earlier that year, may have been occasioned by the circulation of Anderson's constitutions, and the formation of a lodge at Durham under the jurisdiction of the London Grand Lodge. The minutes of 10 August 1725 describe William Scourfield as Worshipful Master. On 27 December, however, Brother Charles Bathurst was elected as Grand Master. His wardens (they were never referred to as \"Grand Wardens\") were Brother Pawson and Francis Drake, the antiquarian, both of whom had only been initiated in September of that year. This occurred after a procession to Merchants Hall, and a banquet. They described themselves as a \"society and fraternity of free Masons\". From 1722, visitors were admitted on examination. In 1725, Drake delivered a speech as Junior Warden, which went unrecorded. However, as the same persons were returned to office in 1726, his speech was written down. He characterised Freemasonry with the attributes of \"Brotherly love, relief, and truth\", and claimed superiority over the Southern Grand Lodge. They were, he said, content that the London lodge have the title Grand Master of England, but York claimed \"Totius Angliae\" (All England). The master of 1724, (now the treasurer) Scourfield, was expelled for making masons irregularly. Drake's speech used the York Legend to claim precedence over all other English lodges, as the first lodge was established under Edwin of Northumbria around the year 600. Here, Edwin was not the brother or son of Athelstan, and the first lodge thereby became over three centuries older. Drake refers to three classes of Freemasons, working masons, other trades, and Gentlemen. Nineteen rules were enacted as Constitutions, and meetings moved from private houses to taverns.\n\nAfter a space, the next minutes are from 21 June 1729. The minutes then become scarce and fall silent. In 1734 some masons travelled south to obtain authorisation for a lodge in York under the jurisdiction of the London Grand Lodge. \n\nIt was not until 1761 that the Grand Lodge was revived, under the Grand Mastership of Drake, for a period of renewed, and more successful activity. In 1767, they wrote to London informing them that their lodge No 259, in Stonegate, York, had ceased to meet, telling them, \"This Lodge acknowledges no superiors and owes subjection to none; she exists in her own right, giving Constitutions and Certificate, in the same way as the Grand Lodge of England in London has asserted her claims there from time immemorial.\" On 31 July 1769, constitutions were granted to the Royal Oak lodge in Ripon, and on 30 October of the same year, Brothers Cateson, Revell, and Ketar were advanced to the degree of Master Mason, before being granted a constitution for the Crown in Boroughbridge. The Royal Arch Degree was introduced in 1768, and \"Knights-Templars\" by 1780. In 1777 London opened the Union lodge in York, but after negotiations during 1778, the rebel half of Antiquity were accepted in 1779 as the \"only regular lodge in London\". Antiquity, London's oldest and most prestigious lodge, had split following a dispute with their own Grand Lodge, who interpreted a walk from church to lodge in regalia by a few of their members as an unauthorised procession. At the centre of the controversy was William Preston, who mediated the move. These London Masons became, for ten years, The Grand Lodge of All England South of the River Trent.\n\nThe last minute is from 23 August 1792. Woodford believed that the lodge didn't cease to exist, it was simply absorbed by the larger Grand Lodge. Unlike other Grand Lodges, it enacted all the functions of a private lodge, as well as any regulatory duties that may have arisen.\n\nAfter 1761, there was worship at the church in Coney Street, followed by a procession to York's Guildhall for a banquet, attended by daughter lodges, ladies, and non-masons. The business of Grand Lodge, where ritual was used, followed the Banquet.\n\nThe operative masons having formed their own company in 1671, the Ancient Society used their copies of the Old Charges as warrants. Lodges which ceased to meet were expected to return their copy.Because the old operative lodge had admitted freemen who had passed their apprenticeship, the apprentice degree at York was largely symbolic, and until 1770 candidates were made Apprentice and Fellow on the same evening. The new degree of Master was administered separately. Candidates took an oath on a bible opened at the first chapter of St. John's Gospel. They were then invested with an apron, and seated at the lodge table, where they received their instruction. From 1760, the Royal Arch, and later the Knights Templar degrees were introduced. All the time, the lectures and catechisms attached to the degrees increased in complexity, a special award being presented to the past master who gave the best rendition. Grand Lodge Minutes of 20 June 1780 show resolutions confirming the authority of the \"Grand Lodge\" over the \"Five degrees or Orders of Masonry\". These were -\n\nThe regulations, or \"constitutions\" of the Grand Lodge, taken with Drakes speech in 1726, provide a window into sparsely documented world of the many independent lodges who refused to associate with the premier Grand Lodge in London.

They are spread across Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan; Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi and other parts of India, and also in Arabia. Citing source from history of the Muhiyals, published in 1911 CE it is disclosed that about 1400 Brahmins had been living in Baghdad when the event of Karbala took place. There are various opinions regarding the origins of the community. About 125 families of Hussaini Brahmins are settled in Pune. A few families are settled in Delhi also and they observe Muharram every year.\n\nAmong various legends about Hussaini Barahmin it is also described that a childless Dutt personally visited Hussain Ibn Ali and submitted his wish to have a child. In response to his desire, he was informed that he had no child in his fate. Hearing that he cannot be a father of son Dutt became senseless and broke down in crying with pain for grant of a child by Imam Hussain with recommendations to God. At this moment, Hussain pacified him saying he will have one soon. Suddenly someone observing the event questioned Hussain stating that he had challenged the will of Allah. Upon hearing this Imam told Dutt he will have one more child. This continued till Imam gave him good news of seven children. Hussaini Brahmins used to live in Lahore till 1947 and after that date they migrated to other locations.\n\nIn Ajmer, Rajasthan, a place of Sunni Muslim pilgrimage, where Moinuddin Chishti lived and passed his last days, there is even today a class of people who call themselves Hussaini Brahmins, who are neither orthodox Hindus nor orthodox Muslims. Hussaini Brahmins practiced a mixed blend of Hinduism and Islamic traditions. A popular saying in Hindi/Urdu language refers to the Hussaini Brahmans thus: \"Wah Datt Sultan, Hindu ka dharm, Musalman ka Iman, Adha Hindu adha Musalman (Well Datt Sultan, declaring Hindu religion and following Muslim faith, Half Hindu and Half Muslman).\n"}
{"id": "315578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315578", "title": "Information processing", "text": "Information processing\n\nInformation processing is the change (processing) of information in any manner detectable by an observer. As such, it is a process that \"describes\" everything that happens (changes) in the universe, from the falling of a rock (a change in position) to the printing of a text file from a digital computer system. In the latter case, an information processor is changing the form of presentation of that text file.\nInformation processing may more specifically be defined in terms used by, Claude E. Shannon as the conversion of latent information into manifest information (McGonigle & Mastrian, 2011). Latent and manifest information is defined through the terms of equivocation (remaining uncertainty, what value the sender has chosen), dissipation (uncertainty of the sender what the receiver has received), and transformation (saved effort of questioning – equivocation minus dissipation) (Denning and Bell, 2012).\n\nWithin the field of cognitive psychology, information processing is an approach to the goal of understanding human thinking in relation to how they process the same kind of information as computers (Shannon & Weaver, 1963). It arose in the 1940s and 1950s, after World War II (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). The approach treats cognition as essentially computational in nature, with \"mind\" being the \"software\" and the brain being the \"hardware\". The information processing approach in psychology is closely allied to the computational theory of mind in philosophy; it is also related, though not identical, to cognitivism in psychology and functionalism in philosophy (Horst, 2011).\n\nInformation processing may be vertical or horizontal, either of which may be centralized or decentralized (distributed). The horizontal distributed processing approach of the mid-1980s became popular under the name connectionism. The connectionist network is made up of different nodes, and it works by a \"priming effect,\" and this happens when a \"prime node activates a connected node\" (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). But \"unlike in semantic networks, it is not a single node that has a specific meaning, but rather the knowledge is represented in a combination of differently activated nodes\"(Goldstein, as cited in Sternberg, 2012).\n\nThere are several proposed models or theories that describe the way in which we process information.\nEvery individual has different information overload point with same information load, because individuals have different information-processing capacity (Eppler and Mengis, 2004)\n\nSternberg's theory of intelligence is made up of three different components: creative, analytical, and practical abilities (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). Creativeness is the ability to have new original ideas, and being analytical can help a person decide whether the idea is a good one or not. \"Practical abilities are used to implement the ideas and persuade others of their value\" (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012 p. 21). In the middle of Sternberg's theory is cognition and with that is information processing. In Sternberg's theory, he says that information processing is made up of three different parts, metacomponents, performance components, and knowledge-acquisition components (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). These processes move from higher-order executive functions to lower order functions. Metacomponents are used for planning and evaluating problems, while performance components follow the orders of the metacomponents, and the knowledge-acquisition component learns how to solve the problems (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). This theory in action can be explained by working on an art project. First is a decision about what to draw, then a plan and a sketch. During this process there is simultaneous monitoring of the process, and whether it is producing the desired accomplishment. All these steps fall under the metacomponent processing, and the performance component is the art. The knowledge-acquisition portion is the learning or improving drawing skills.\n\nAccording to thefreedictionary.com, the definition of information processing is \"the sciences concerned with gathering, manipulating, storing, retrieving, and classifying recorded information\". It suggests that for information to be firmly implanted in memory, it must pass through three stages of mental processing; sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. An example of this is the working memory model. This includes the central executive, phonologic loop, episodic buffer,visuospatial sketchpad, verbal information, long term memory, and visual information (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). The central executive is like the secretary of the brain. It decides what needs attention and how to respond.The central executive then leads to three different subsections. The first is phonological storage, subvocal rehearsal, and the phonological loop. These sections work together to understand words, put the information into memory, and then hold the memory. The result is verbal information storage. The next subsection is the visuospatial sketchpad which works to store visual images. The storage capacity is brief but leads to understanding of visual stimuli. Finally, there is an episodic buffer. This section is capable of taking information and putting it into long-term memory. It is also able to take information from the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, combining them with long-term memory to make \"a unitary episodic representation (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). \nIn order for these to work, the sensory register takes in via the five senses: visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. These are all present since birth and are able to handle simultaneous processing (e.g., food – taste it, smell it, see it). In general, learning benefits occur when there is a developed process of pattern recognition. The sensory register has a large capacity and its behavioral response is very short (1–3 seconds). \nWithin this model, sensory store and short term memory or working memory has limited capacity. Sensory store is able to hold very limited amounts of information for very limited amounts of time. This phenomenon is very similar to having a picture taken with a flash. For a few brief moments after the flash goes off, the flash it seems to still be there. However, it is soon gone and there is no way to know it was there (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012). Short term memory holds information for slightly longer periods of time, but still has a limited capacity. According to Linden (2007), \"The capacity of STM had initially been estimated at \"seven plus or minus two\" items (Miller 1956), which fits the observation from neuropsychological testing that the average digit span of healthy adults is about seven (Cowan and others 2005). However, it emerged that these numbers of items can only be retained if they are grouped into so-called chunks, using perceptual or conceptual associations between individual stimuli.\" Its duration is of 5–20 seconds before it is out of the subject's mind. This occurs often with names of people newly introduced to. Images or information based on meaning are stored here as well, but it decays without rehearsal or repetition of such information. \nOn the other hand, long-term memory has a potentially unlimited capacity (Sternberg & Sternberg, 2012) and its duration is as good as indefinite. Although sometimes it is difficult to access, it encompasses everything learned until this point in time. One might become forgetful or feel as if the information is on the tip of the tongue.\n\nAnother approach to viewing the ways in which information is processed in humans was suggested by Jean Piaget in what is called the \"Piaget's Cognitive Development Theory\" (Presnell, 1999). Piaget developed his model based on development and growth. He identified four different stages between different age brackets characterized by the type of information and by a distinctive thought process. The four stages are: the sensorimotor (from birth to 2 years), preoperational (2–6 years), concrete operational (6–11 years), and formal operational periods (11 years and older). During the sensorimotor stage, newborns and toddlers rely on their senses for information processing to which they respond with reflexes. In the preoperational stage, children learn through imitation and remain unable to take other people's point of view. The concrete operational stage is characterized by the developing ability to use logic and to consider multiple factors to solve a problem. The last stage is the formal operational, in which preadolescents and adolescents begin to understand abstract concepts and to develop the ability to create arguments and counter arguments.\n\nFurthermore, adolescence is characterized by a series of changes in the biological, cognitive, and social realms. In the cognitive area, it is worth noting that the brain's prefrontal cortex as well as the limbic system undergoes important changes. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain that is active when engaged in complicated cognitive activities such as planning, generating goals and strategies, intuitive decision-making, and metacognition (thinking about thinking). This is consistent with Piaget's last stage of formal operations (McLeod, 2010). The prefrontal cortex becomes complete between adolescence and early adulthood. The limbic system is the part of the brain that modulates reward sensitivity based on changes in the levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine) and emotions.\n\nIn short, cognitive abilities vary according to our development and stages in life. It is at the adult stage that we are better able to be better planners, process and comprehend abstract concepts, and evaluate risks and benefits more aptly than an adolescent or child would be able to.\n\nIn computing, information processing broadly refers to the use of algorithms to transform data—the defining activity of computers; indeed, a broad computing professional organization is known as the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP). It is essentially synonymous with the terms data processing or computation, although with a more general connotation.\n\n\n\n"}

He was jailed and imprisoned several times due to his political activism. He migrated to Switzerland in 1906, fleeing the Czarist repression in the Russian empire. He continued his Law studies in his new homeland. He obtained his degree in 1909 and was admitted to the bar in 1915. He would become a prominent penal lawyer.\n\nDicker became a Swiss citizen in 1915. In Swiss politics, Dicker emerged as a prominent leader of the Socialist Party in Geneva. He collaborated with Léon Nicole at the newspaper \"Le Travail\". Between 1922 and 1925, Dicker represented Geneva in the National Council. He returned to the National Council in 1928, and would remain a member of that body until 1941. Dicker defended Nicole in a legal case in May 1933.\n\nBeing a prominent Jewish political leader, Dicker was subjected to violent antisemitic attacks. On November 9, 1932 the far-right National Union convened a meeting in the municipal hall in Plainpalais, a meeting intended to function as a tribunal against Nicole and Dicker. A leftist countermanifestation was organized. Violence broke out between demonstrators and army, killing 13 people and injuring 65.\n\nDicker was one of four Socialist parliamentarians that sided with the Swiss Socialist Federation when the Socialist Party went through a split in 1939.

{"id": "348762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=348762", "title": "Mari language", "text": "Mari language\n\nThe Mari language (Mari: , \"marii jõlme\"; , \"marijskij jazyk\"), spoken by approximately 400,000 people, belongs to the Uralic language family. It is spoken primarily in the Mari Republic (Mari: , \"Marii El\", i.e., 'Mari land') of the Russian Federation as well as in the area along the Vyatka river basin and eastwards to the Urals. Mari speakers, known as the Mari, are found also in the Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Udmurtia, and Perm regions.\n\nMari is the titular and official language of its republic, alongside Russian.\n\nThe Mari language today has two standard forms: Hill Mari and Meadow Mari. The latter is predominant and spans the continuum Meadow Mari to Eastern Mari from the Republic into the Ural dialects of Bashkortostan, Sverdlovsk Oblast and Udmurtia), whereas the former, Hill Mari, shares a stronger affiliation with the Northwestern dialect (spoken in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and parts of the Kirov Oblast). Both language forms use modified versions of Cyrillic script. For the non-native, Hill Mari, or Western Mari, can be recognized by its use of the special letters \"ӓ\" and \"ӹ\" in addition to the mutual letters \"ӱ\" and \"ӧ\", while Eastern and Meadow Mari utilize a special letter \"ҥ\".\n\nThe use of two \"variants\", as opposed to two \"languages\", has been debated: Maris recognize the unity of the ethnic group, and the two forms are very close, but distinct enough to cause some problems with communication.\n\nThe Mari language and people were known as \"Cheremis\" (, \"cheremisy\", \"cheremisskiy yazyk\"). In medieval texts the variant forms Sarmys and Tsarmys are also found, as well as ; and , \"Śarmăs\" before the Russian Revolution. The term \"Mari\" comes from the Maris' autonym (), which is thought to have been borrowed from the Indo-Aryan term *\"maryá-\" 'man', literally 'mortal, one who is bound to die' ( < PIE *\"\" 'to die').\n\nMost Maris live in rural areas with slightly more than a quarter living in cities. In the republican capital, Yoshkar-Ola, the percentage of Maris is just over 23 percent. At the end of the 1980s (per the 1989 census) Maris numbered 670,868, of whom 80% (542,160) claimed Mari as their first language and 18.8% did not speak Mari. In the Mari Republic, 11.6% claimed Mari was not their first language. In a survey by the Mari Research Institute more than 3/4 of Maris survey considered Mari language to be the most crucial marker of ethnic identity, followed by traditional culture (61%) and common historical past (22%), religion (16%), character and mentality (15%) and appearance (11%) (see Glukhov and Glukhov for details). A gradual downward trend towards assimilation to Russian has been noted for the Communist period: the 1926 census indicated more than 99% of Maris considered Mari their first language, declining to less than 81% in 1989. Some qualitative evidence of a reversal in recent years has been noted.\n\nThere was no state support for Mari language in Imperial Russia, and with the exception of some enthusiasts and numerous ecclesiastical texts by the Russian Orthodox Church, there was almost no education in Mari language. After the October Revolution, there was a period of support of all lesser national cultures in the Soviet Union, but eventually Russification returned. While the development of Mari literary language continued, still, only elementary-school education was available in Mari in the Soviet period, with this policy ending in village schools in the 1970–1980s. The period of glasnost and perestroika in the 1990s opened opportunities for a revival of efforts expand the use of Mari in education and the public sphere. In the 1990s, the Mari language, alongside Russian, was proclaimed in the republican constitution to be an official language of Mari El. By the beginning of the 21st century, Mari language and literature was taught in 226 schools. At the History and Philology Department of the Mari State University and the Krupskaya Teachers' Training Institute (Yoshkar-Ola), more than half of the subjects are taught in Mari.\n\nThe principal division between Mari varieties is the West and the East. According to the Soviet linguist Kovedyaeva (1976:9-15, 1993:163-164) the Mari macrolanguage is divided into four main dialects:\nEach main dialect is divided into their own smaller local subdialects. Only Hill and Meadow Mari have their own literary written standard varieties, based on the dialects of Kozmodemyansk and Yoshkar-Ola respectively.\n\nEastern and Meadow Mari are often united as a Meadow-Eastern supra-dialect. North-Western Mari is transitional between the Hill and Meadow dialects, and its phonology and morphology are closer to Hill Mari.\n\nMari is mostly written with the Cyrillic script.\n\nThe schwa and its fronted counterpart are usually transcribed in Finno-Ugric transcription as \"ə̑\" (reduced mid unrounded vowel) and \"ə\" (reduced front unrounded vowel) respectively. The former has sometimes been transcribed in IPA as , but phonetically the vowel is most strongly distinguished by its short duration and reduced quality. Descriptions vary on the degree of backness and labialization.\n\nThe mid vowels , , have more reduced allophones , , at the end of a word.\n\nStress is not phonemic in Mari, but a dynamic stress system is exhibited phonetically, the stressed syllable being higher in pitch and amplitude and greater in length than an unstressed syllable. Generally, there is one prominent syllable per word and prominence may be found in any syllable of the word. Post- and prefixes behave as clitics, i.e., they do not have their own stress. For example, пӧ́рт (\"pört\", \"house\") гыч (\"gəč\", \"out of\") (); or му́ро (\"muro\", \"song\") дене (\"dene\", \"with\") ().\n\nConsonants are shown in Cyrillic, Latin, and the :\n\n\nLike several other Uralic languages, Mari has vowel harmony. In addition to front/back harmony, Mari also features round/unround harmony. If the stressed vowel in the word is rounded, then the suffix will contain a rounded vowel: for example, кӱтӱ́ ([kyˈty] 'herd') becomes кӱтӱ́штӧ ([kyˈtyʃtø]], 'in the herd'); if the stressed vowel is unrounded, then the suffix will contain an unrounded vowel: ки́д ([kid], 'hand') becomes ки́дыште ([ˈkidəʃte], 'in the hand'). If the stressed vowel is back, then the suffix will end in a back vowel: агу́р ([aˈgur], 'whirlpool') becomes агу́рышто ([aˈgurəʃto], 'in the whirlpool'). \n\nLike other Uralic languages, Mari is an agglutinating language. It lacks grammatical gender, and does not use articles.\n\nMeadow Mari has 9 productive cases, of which 3 are locative cases. The usage of the latter ones is restricted to inanimate objects.\n\nMany cases, aside from their basic function, are used in other situations, such as in expressions of time.\n\n\nIf a locative statement was to be made about an animate object, postpositions would be used.\n\nAdditionally, terms denoting family members have vocative forms. These are, however, not created with a specific paradigm, and only exist in a few pre-defined cases.\n\nHill Mari has these cases, plus the abessive case (of the form -де), which is used to form adverbials stating without the involvement or influence of which an action happens.\n\nMari, though an agglutinative language, does not have a separate morpheme to signify plurality. There are three particles, which are attached to the end of words with a hyphen, used to signify plural.\n\nEvery grammatical person in Mari has its own possessive suffix.\n\nAdditional particles, falling into none of the categories above, can be added to the very end of a word, giving it some additional meaning. For example, the suffix -ат \"(-at\"), means 'also' or 'too'.\n\nThe arrangement of suffixes varies from case to case. Although the case suffixes are after the possessive suffixes in the genitive and the accusative, the opposite is the case for the locative cases. In the dative, both arrangements are possible.\n\nThere are many other arrangements in the plural—the position of the plural particle is flexible. The arrangement here is one commonly used possibility.\n\nComparison happens with adjectives and adverbs. The comparative is formed with the suffix -рак (-rak). The superlative is formed by adding the word эн (en) in front.\n\nMorphologically, conjugation follows three tenses and three moods in Meadow Mari.\n\nIn Meadow Mari, words can conjugate according to two conjugation types. These differ from each other in all forms but the infinitive and the third-person plural of the imperative. Unfortunately, the infinitive is the form denoted in dictionaries and word lists. It is, thus, necessary to either mark verb infinitives by their conjugation type in word lists, or to include a form in which the conjugation type is visible—usually, the first-person singular present, which ends in -ам (or -ям) for verbs in the first declination, and in -ем (or -эм) for second-declination verbs.\n\nThe three tenses of Mari verbs are:\n\nThe present tense is used for present and future actions, for states of being and for habitual actions, among others.\n\nThe first preterite is used to express observed, recent actions.\n\nThe second preterite is used for actions that are in the more-distant past.\n\nAdditional tenses can be formed through periphrasis.\n\nThe moods are:\n\nThe indicative is used to express facts and positive beliefs. All intentions that a particular language does not categorize as another mood are classified as indicative. It can be formed in all persons, in all times.\n\nThe imperative expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. It only exists in the present tense, and exists in all persons but the first person singular.\n\nThe desiderative is used to express desires. It can be formed for all persons, in the present tense and in the two periphrastic imperfect.\n\nNegation in Mari uses a 'negative verb', much like Finnish does. The negative verb is more versatile than the negative verb in Finnish (see Finnish grammar), existing in more grammatical tenses and moods. It has its own form in the present indicative, imperative and desiderative, and in the first preterite indicative. Other negations are periphrastic.\n\nThe negation verb in its corresponding form is put in front of the negated verb in its second-person singular (the stem-only form), much as it is in Finnish and Estonian.\n\nThe verb улаш (ulaš) – to be – has its own negated forms.\n\nIn order to illustrate the conjugation in the respective moods and times, one verb of the first declination (лекташ – to go) and one verb of the second declination (мондаш – to forget) will be used.\n\n\n\n\nVerbs have two infinitive forms: the standard infinitive and the necessive infinitive, used when a person must do something. The person needing to do something is put in the dative in such a situation.\n\nThere are four participles in Meadow Mari:\n\nThere are five gerunds in Meadow Mari:\n\nWord order in Mari is subject–object–verb.\n\nNote that the accent mark, which denotes the place of stress, is not used in actual Mari orthography.\n\n1990;\n\n"}

Only about 400 or fewer Mlabris remain in the world today, with some estimates as low as 100. A hill tribe in northern Thailand along the border with Laos, they have been groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers. Those in Thailand live close to the Hmong and northern Thai. Those living in Laos live close to other ethnic groups.\n\nThe name \"Mlabri\" is a Thai/Lao alteration of the word \"Mrabri\", which appears to come from a Khmuic term \"people of the forest\". In Khmu, \"mra\" means \"person\" and \"bri\" \"forest\". They are also known locally as \"Phi Tong Luang\" (Thai: ผีตองเหลือง, Lao: ຜີຕອງເຫລືອງ) or \"spirits of the yellow leaves\", since they abandon their shelters when the leaves begin to turn yellow.\n\nGenetic analysis of the Mlabri group by Hiroki Oota and colleagues led them to believe that their mtDNA has little diversity, suggesting the Mlabris originated 500 to 800 years ago from very few individuals. However, this was contested in the journal PLoS Biology in 2005 in an exchange of articles between Hiroki Oota and his colleagues and Tony Waters.\n\nThe Mlabri traditionally lived a nomadic lifestyle. They moved frequently, and had no permanent houses, instead making temporary shelters from palm leaves and bamboo-string. They wore only a loin-covering of bark or cloth, though most Mlabri now wear factory-made clothes gained by trade with other hill tribes. They are hunter-gatherers, with most of their food coming from gathering. Women give birth alone in the forest and infant mortality used to be very high.\n\nThe Mlabri have few regimented social ceremonies, and are said to have no formal religious system, though they believe in forest spirits and other nature spirit. Marriages are made with simple request; there is no bride-price. The dead are buried near where they expired, and the tribe moves on.\n\nIn 1938, Austrian anthropologist Hugo Bernatzik published an ethnography of the \"Yellow Leaf People\" which contained his brief observations of the tribe in the early 20th century.\n\nSince the 1990s, the Mlabri in Thailand have settled into more permanent villages in Phrae and Nan provinces. The houses they live in are made of cinderblock and wood, with metal roofs and even electricity. Mlabri children have started going to public schools, and their health care has improved. It was reported in 2013 that the Mlabri's suicide rate has risen. Mlabri villages have some economic activity. While still hunting and gathering, the Mlabri now engage in highland farming and hammock weaving, besides working as day laborers.\n\nOne of the Mlabri settlements in Nan Province is under the patronage of HRH Princess Sirindhorn.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55223034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55223034", "title": "Murder of Evelyn Okubo", "text": "Murder of Evelyn Okubo\n\nEvelyn Okubo was a Japanese-American sansei teenager killed during the 1970 convention of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) at the Palmer House hotel in Chicago. Her 17-year-old roommate, Ranko Carol Yamada, was also severely wounded, yet survived. The murder caused a significant stir within the Japanese-American community, in part because Yamada alleged that the killer was black, just at the height of violence associated with the Black Panther Party. The killer was never found.\n\nEvelyn Okubo was 18 years old and hailed from the Japanese community of Stockton, California. She and Ranko Carol Yamada had traveled to Chicago as representatives of the Japanese-American youth organization Yellow Seed to the national convention of the JACL, which was then focused on fighting for racial justice and against the war in Vietnam. Prior to the murder, Okubo was believed to have attended racial issue discussion meetings with groups like the Black Panthers and the Young Lords, a Latino community organization with roots as a Chicago turf gang.\n\nOn July 17th, 1970, Okubo was murdered, and Yamada was slashed in the throat, in room 725 of the Palmer House hotel. Yamada, though badly wounded, wrote out several messages: \"Gory, but it doesn't really hurt,\" \"He was a black man with a natural,\" and \"Don't blame him it was not his fault. There must be absolute peace.\" When they were discovered about half an hour later by the third JACL attendee sharing the hotel room, both girls had been stripped naked and bound, though neither showed evidence of being raped. Yamada couldn't speak for two weeks after the incident due to her throat injury, but eventually recounted that the attacker had pranced around naked before killing Okubo. \n\nChicago newspapers originally ran sensational stories alleging that Okubo was raped prior to being murdered, and implied that interracial dating on the part of the youth activists was to blame. Meanwhile, two police officers were killed by sniper fire from a housing project that same day, while several police and Panthers had been killed the previous year, which added to the supposition that Okubo was killed by a Panther. According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", police named a man named Lonell Robinson as a prime suspect after he was caught raping and robbing another woman in the same hotel. However, he was later ruled out as a suspect, though in the rape case he was indeed convicted the following year. The newspapers also eventually acknowledged that no rape had been committed in Okubo's case, and though some columnists suspected that racial animus was a motive, this has never been confirmed as the perpetrator was never found.\n\nMabel Okubo, Evelyn's mother, and Carol Yamada later filed a civil suit against the Palmer House, alleging negligence.\n\nThe tragedy of Okubo's murder was the inspiration for Japanese-American songwriter and musician JoAnne Nobuko Miyamoto, another JACL attendee and \"West Side Story\" actress, to write her first song. She and fellow musician Chris Iijima began touring Japanese-American communities, advocating interracial reconciliation and activism while raising money to honor Okubo's memory. Ultimately, they would form the band Yellow Pearl (a pun on Yellow Peril) and become a touchstone in Asian-American media.\n\nHowever, many older Japanese-Americans viewed the murder as confirming their suspicions about the dangers of interracial activism by young Japanese-Americans, and despite the fact that no evidence has been found to support the claim, the belief that the crime was committed by a Black Panther remains prevalent in parts of the community.\n\n"}

{"id": "153079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153079", "title": "Ornette Coleman", "text": "Ornette Coleman\n\nRandolph Denard Ornette Coleman (March 9, 1930 – June 11, 2015) was an American jazz saxophonist, violinist, trumpeter, and composer. In the 1960s, he was one of the founders of free jazz, a term he invented for his album \"\". His \"Broadway Blues\" has become a standard and has been cited as an important work in free jazz. His album \"Sound Grammar\" received the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music.\n\nColeman was born in 1930 in Fort Worth, Texas, where he was raised. His sister, Truvenza Coleman claims that he was born on March 9, 1931. He attended I.M. Terrell High School, where he participated in band until he was dismissed for improvising during \"The Washington Post\" march. He began performing R&B and bebop on tenor saxophone and started The Jam Jivers with Prince Lasha and Charles Moffett. Eager to leave town, he accepted a job in 1949 with a Silas Green from New Orleans traveling show and then with touring rhythm and blues shows. After a show in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he was assaulted and his saxophone was destroyed. He switched to alto saxophone, which remained his primary instrument, first playing it in New Orleans after the Baton Rouge incident. He then joined the band of Pee Wee Crayton and traveled with them to Los Angeles. He worked at various jobs, including as an elevator operator, while pursuing his music career.\n\nIn California he found like-minded musicians such as Ed Blackwell, Bobby Bradford, Don Cherry, Charlie Haden, Billy Higgins, and Charles Moffett. He recorded his debut album, \"Something Else!!!!\" (1958) with Cherry, Higgins, Walter Norris, and Don Payne. During the same year he belonged briefly to a quintet led by Paul Bley that performed at a club in New York City. By the time \"Tomorrow Is the Question!\" was recorded soon after with Cherry, Higgins, and Haden, the jazz world had been shaken up by Coleman's alien music. Some jazz musicians called him a fraud, while conductor Leonard Bernstein praised him.\n\nIn 1959 Atlantic released \"The Shape of Jazz to Come\" According to music critic Steve Huey, the album \"was a watershed event in the genesis of avant-garde jazz, profoundly steering its future course and throwing down a gauntlet that some still haven't come to grips with.\" \"Jazzwise\" listed it No. 3 on their list of the 100 best jazz albums of all time.\n\nColeman's quartet received a lengthy – and sometimes controversial – engagement at New York City's famed Five Spot jazz club. Such notable figures as the Modern Jazz Quartet, Leonard Bernstein and Lionel Hampton were favorably impressed, and offered encouragement. (Hampton was so impressed he reportedly asked to perform with the quartet; Bernstein later helped Haden obtain a composition grant from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.) Opinion was, however, divided. Trumpeter Miles Davis famously declared Coleman was \"all screwed up inside\", although Davis recanted this comment and became a proponent of Coleman's innovations. Roy Eldridge stated, \"I'd listened to him all kinds of ways. I listened to him high and I listened to him cold sober. I even played with him. I think he's jiving baby.\"\n\nColeman's unique early sound was due in part to his use of a plastic saxophone. He had first bought a plastic horn in Los Angeles in 1954 because he was unable to afford a metal saxophone, though he didn't like the sound of the plastic instrument at first. Coleman later claimed that it sounded drier, without the pinging sound of metal. In later years, he played a metal saxophone.\n\nOn the Atlantic recordings, Coleman's sidemen in the quartet are Cherry on cornet or pocket trumpet, Haden, Scott LaFaro, and then Jimmy Garrison on bass, and Higgins or his replacement Ed Blackwell on drums. The complete released recordings for the label were collected on the box set \"Beauty Is a Rare Thing\".\n\nIn 1960, Coleman recorded \"\", which featured a double quartet, including Don Cherry and Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet, Haden and LaFaro on bass, and both Higgins and Blackwell on drums. The record was recorded in stereo, with a reed/brass/bass/drums quartet isolated in each stereo channel. \"Free Jazz\" was, at nearly 40 minutes, the lengthiest recorded continuous jazz performance to date, and was instantly one of Coleman's most controversial albums. The music features a regular but complex pulse, one drummer playing \"straight\" while the other played double-time; the thematic material is a series of brief, dissonant fanfares. As is conventional in jazz, there are a series of solo features for each member of the band, but the other soloists are free to chime in as they wish, producing some extraordinary passages of collective improvisation by the full octet. In the January 18, 1962 issue of \"Down Beat\" magazine, in a special review titled \"Double View of a Double Quartet,\" Pete Welding awarded the album Five Stars while John A. Tynan rated it No Stars.\n\nColeman intended \"free jazz\" as simply an album title, but his growing reputation placed him at the forefront of jazz innovation, and free jazz was soon considered a new genre, though Coleman has expressed discomfort with the term. Among the reasons Coleman may not have entirely approved of the term 'free jazz' is that his music contains a considerable amount of composition. His melodic material, although skeletal, strongly recalls the melodies that Charlie Parker wrote over standard harmonies, and in general the music is closer to the bebop that came before it than is sometimes popularly imagined. (Several early tunes of his, for instance, are clearly based on favorite bop chord changes like \"Out of Nowhere\" and \"I Got Rhythm\".) Coleman very rarely played standards, concentrating on his own compositions, of which there seemed to be an endless flow. There are exceptions, though, including a classic reading (virtually a recomposition) of \"Embraceable You\" for Atlantic, and an improvisation on Thelonious Monk's \"Criss-Cross\" recorded with Gunther Schuller.\n\nAfter the Atlantic period and into the early part of the 1970s, Coleman's music became more angular and engaged fully with the jazz avant-garde which had developed in part around his innovations.\n\nHis quartet dissolved, and Coleman formed a new trio with David Izenzon on bass, and Charles Moffett on drums. Coleman began to extend the sound-range of his music, introducing accompanying string players (though far from the territory of \"Charlie Parker with Strings\") and playing trumpet and violin (which he played left-handed) himself. He initially had little conventional musical technique and used the instruments to make large, unrestrained gestures. His friendship with Albert Ayler influenced his development on trumpet and violin. Haden would later sometimes join this trio to form a two-bass quartet.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1967 Coleman signed with Blue Note Records and released a number of recordings starting with the influential recordings of the trio \"At the Golden Circle Stockholm\". In 1966, Coleman recorded \"The Empty Foxhole\", with a trio featuring Haden and Coleman's son Denardo Coleman – who was ten years old. While some, like Shelly Manne and Freddie Hubbard, regarded this as perhaps an ill-advised piece of publicity on Coleman's part and judged the move a mistake., others noted that despite his youth, Denardo had studied drumming for several years and his technique – which, though unrefined, was respectable and enthusiastic – owed more to pulse-oriented free jazz drummers like Sunny Murray than to bebop drumming. Denardo became his father's primary drummer in the late 1970s.\n\nColeman formed another quartet. Haden, Garrison, and Elvin Jones appeared, and Dewey Redman joined the group, usually on tenor saxophone. On February 29, 1968 in a group with Haden, Ed Blackwell, and David Izenzon Coleman performed live with Yoko Ono at Albert Hall. One song was included on the album \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970)\n\nHe continued to explore his interest in string textures – from \"Town Hall, 1962\", culminating with the \"Skies of America\" album in 1972. (Sometimes this had a practical value, as it facilitated his group's appearance in the UK in 1965, where jazz musicians were under a quota arrangement but classical performers were exempt.)\n\nColeman, like Miles Davis before him, took to playing with electrified instruments. The 1976 funk album \"Dancing in Your Head\", Coleman's first recording with the group which later became known as Prime Time, prominently featured electric guitars. While this marked a stylistic departure for Coleman, the music maintained certain similarities to his earlier work. These performances had the same angular melodies and simultaneous group improvisations – what Joe Zawinul referred to as \"nobody solos, everybody solos\" and what Coleman called \"harmolodics\" – and although the nature of the pulse was altered, Coleman's rhythmic approach did not.\n\nIn the 1980s, albums like \"Virgin Beauty\" and \"Of Human Feelings\" continued to use rock and funk rhythms, sometimes called free funk. Jerry Garcia played guitar on three tracks from Coleman's 1988 album \"Virgin Beauty\": \"Three Wishes\", \"Singing in the Shower\", and \"Desert Players\". Coleman joined the Grateful Dead on stage once in 1993 during \"Space\", and stayed for \"The Other One\", \"Stella Blue\", Bobby Bland's \"Turn on Your Lovelight\", and the encore \"Brokedown Palace\". Another collaboration was with guitarist Pat Metheny, with whom Coleman recorded \"Song X\" (1985); though released under Metheny's name, Coleman was essentially co-leader (contributing all the compositions).\n\nIn 1990, the city of Reggio Emilia in Italy held a three-day \"Portrait of the Artist\" featuring a Coleman quartet with Cherry, Haden and Higgins. The festival also presented performances of his chamber music and the symphonic \"Skies of America\".\n\nIn 1991, Coleman played on the soundtrack for David Cronenberg's \"Naked Lunch\"; the orchestra was conducted by Howard Shore. It is notable among other things for including a rare sighting of Coleman playing a jazz standard: Thelonious Monk's blues line \"Misterioso\". Two 1972 (pre-electric) Coleman recordings, \"Happy House\" and \"Foreigner in a Free Land\" were used in Gus Van Sant's 2000 \"Finding Forrester\".\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a flurry of activity from Coleman: he released four records in 1995 and 1996, and for the first time in many years worked regularly with piano players (either Geri Allen or Joachim Kühn).\n\nIn September 2006 he released a live album titled \"Sound Grammar\" with his newest quartet (Denardo drumming and two bassists, Gregory Cohen and Tony Falanga). This was his first album of new material in ten years, and was recorded in Germany in 2005. It won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for music, Coleman being only the second jazz artist to win the prize.\n\nJazz pianist Joanne Brackeen (who had only briefly studied music as a child) stated in an interview with Marian McPartland that Coleman had been mentoring her and giving her semi-formal music lessons in recent years.\n\nColeman continued to push himself into unusual playing situations, often with much younger musicians or musicians from radically different musical cultures. An increasing number of his compositions, while not ubiquitous, have become minor jazz standards, including \"Lonely Woman\", \"Peace\", \"Turnaround\", \"When Will the Blues Leave?\", \"The Blessing\", \"Law Years\", \"What Reason Could I Give\" and \"I've Waited All My Life\". He has influenced virtually every saxophonist of a modern disposition, and nearly every such jazz musician, of the generation that followed him. His songs have proven endlessly malleable: pianists such as Paul Bley and Paul Plimley have managed to turn them to their purposes; John Zorn recorded \"Spy vs Spy\" (1989), an album of extremely loud, fast, and abrupt versions of Coleman songs. Finnish jazz singer Carola covered Coleman's \"Lonely Woman\" and there have even been progressive bluegrass versions of Coleman tunes (by Richard Greene).\n\n\nColeman married poet Jayne Cortez in 1954. The couple divorced in 1964. They had one son, Denardo, born in 1956, who became a notable jazz drummer in his own right.\n\nColeman died of a cardiac arrest at the age of 85 in New York City on June 11, 2015. His funeral was a three-hour event with performances and speeches by several of his collaborators and contemporaries.\n\n\n"}

Pashtunistan is home to the majority of the Pashtun community. However, there are significant Pashtun diaspora communities in the Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan, in particular in the cities of Karachi and Lahore. A recent Pashtun diaspora has also developed in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, primarily in the United Arab Emirates. Smaller populations of Pashtuns are found in the European Union, North America, Australia and other parts of the world. They may also be found in Iran, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. In Northern India, there are communities of Indians who trace their origins to the traditional Pashtun homeland.\n\nThe Pashtun ethnic group are believed to have settled in the vast Pashtunistan region in the first millennium C.E. According to Ethnologue, they currently number around 50 million, but some sources give slightly lower or higher figures. Nearly a million Pashtuns migrated and settled in the lands of Delhi Sultanate, Mughal Empire and other regional Muslim states in Indian subcontinent (modern Pakistan, India and Bangladesh some later migrated and settled in Nepal and Sri Lanka) over the centuries and their descendents assimilated with the Urdu speaking Muslims and they are known as \"Pathan\".\n\nThe ethnonym \"Afghan\" has been historically used since the 3rd century AD to refer to the Pashtuns, and is now used to describe every citizen of Afghanistan. Pashtuns make up the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, comprising 42–60% of the total Afghan population. Approximately 1.7 million Afghan refugees live in neighboring Pakistan. The majority of them are Pashtuns who were born in that country.\n\nThe Pashtuns are scattered all over Afghanistan, they can be found in almost every province of the country. Kandahar is the second largest city in Afghanistan and a stronghold of the Pashtun culture. The city of Lashkar Gah in the south, Farah in the west, Jalalabad in the east, and Kunduz in the north are other prominent cultural centres whose populations are predominantly Pashtun. Kabul and Ghazni each have at least 25% Pashtun while Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif each has at least 10%.\n\nPashtun tribes make up the second largest ethnic group in Pakistan, comprising about 30%. They form the majority ethnic group in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) areas, and northern Balochistan.\n\nWith as many as 7 million by some estimates, the city of Karachi in Sindh Province hosts the largest concentration of urban Pashtuns population in the world Some important Pashtun cities of Pakistan include: Peshawar, Quetta, Zhob, Loralai, Killa Saifullah, Swat, Mardan, Charsada, Mingora, Bannu, Parachinar, and Swabi.\n\nThe following delineates the Pashtun population in the provinces of Pakistan:\n\nSmaller Pashtun communities outside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa can be found in the districts of Attock and Mianwali in Punjab. These and other communities of Pashtun ancestry are often referred to as the Punjabi Pashtun. There are also large communities of Punjabi-Pashtuns Such as Niazi and others lives in Khanewal, Kasur, and other larger communities have settled around Multan which was formerly part of the Durrani Empire. Pathan community lives in different district of Azad Kashmir. Mainly they are being settled in districts of Poonch, Sudhnuti and Bagh. In Poonch and Sudhnuti they constitute more than 70% population of district. Kashmiri Pashtuns mainly consists of Sadozai tribe which are locally known as Sudhan. Approximate population of Sadozais in AJK is 1 million. Sadozai tribe has a strong hold in Rawalakot city in Azad Kashmir. Small no of other pashtun tribes in Kashmir which include Durrani, Tareen, Lodhi, Yousafzai Shinwary and Afridi tribes which extends from Azad Kashmir to India's Jammu & Kashmir. They speak local languages.\n\nIn addition to this, some Urdu-speaking communities in Pakistan trace their ancestry to the ancient Pashtun regions of Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhawa. Some identify themselves as Bangash, Yousefzai, Ghouri and Durrani. Additionally, a significant number of descendants of Rohillas migrated to Pakistan after the independence of Pakistan in 1947.The Rohilla Pushtuns make up 30-30% of the Muhajir community in Karachi.\n\nIndia, as a British colony, once had a large Pashtun population roughly equal to that of Afghanistan, mostly concentrated in what were then the British Indian provinces of the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan. In Rohilkhand, they made large settlements subsequent to 14th century and prior to the 20th century. In fact, according to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the number of Pashtuns in all of India was nearly 31 million, but the speakers of Pashto numbered less than 14 million. Most of this population was allotted, along with its respective provinces, to Pakistan after the independence in 1947. Today the Pashtuns in India can be divided into those who speak Pashto and those who speak Urdu/Hindi and other regional languages, the Urdu/Hindi speaking group being the biggest.\n\nRampur has the largest number of Pathan population among the cities of India, Some of the well known Pashtun families of Rampur are the Nawab family of Rampur, individually the well known Pashtuns personalities are Late Manzoor Ali Khan Alias Shannu Khan, Late Akhtar Ali Khan, Late Fazlehaq Khan, Afroz Ali Khan, Babar Ali Khan, Zubair Khan Prince, Shahid Aijaz Khan, Faisal Khan lala, Dr.Tanveer Ahmad Khan,Jugnu Khan etc.\n\nThere are a large number of Pashto-speaking Pakhtuns in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Although their exact numbers are hard to determine, it is at least in excess of 100,000 for it is known that in 1954 over 100,000 nomadic Pakhtuns living in Kashmir Valley were granted Indian\ncitizenship. Today jirgas are frequently held. Those settled and living in the Kashmir Valley speak Pashto, and are found chiefly in the southwest of the valley, where Pashtun colonies have from time to time been founded. The most interesting are the Kukikhel Afridis of Dramghaihama, who retain all the old customs and speak Pashto. They wear colorful dress and carry swords and shields. The Afridis and the Machipurians, who belong to the Yusufzai tribe, are liable to military service, in return for which they hold certain villages free of revenue. The Pashtuns chiefly came in under the Durranis, but many were brought by Maharajah Gulab Singh for service on the frontier. Pashto is also spoken in two villages, Dhakki and Changnar (Chaknot), located on the Line of Control in Kupwara District. In response to demand by the Pashtun community living in the state, Kashir TV has recently launched a series of Pushto-language programs.\n\nA further small, scattered Pashtun population still exists in some major cities of India with large Muslim populations, with the majority of Pashto-speaking individuals residing in the states of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh India; who also have adopted local languages of the respective areas they live in, as their second language. These Pathans, numbering around 14,161, have retained the use of the Pashto language and are still able to speak and understand it. This is partially because until recently, most of these Indian Pashtuns were able to travel to Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nThe larger number of people claiming Pashtun ancestry in Pakistan and India are Urdu speaking. Despite the loss of most of the Raj-era Pashtun population, India still has a large community of Hindustani speakers who trace their ancestry to ancient Pashtun settlers. They are often referred by the Hindustani pronunciation of the word Pashtun, \"Pathan\".\n\nMajor Indian Pathan tribes lived in the following areas. While many persons belonging to these tribes moved to the Afghan-Pakistan border, others chose to stay and thus, descendants of these tribes still reside in the parts of India listed below:\n\ncommunity within the larger community of the Pathans of India. They belonge mainly to the Babi (AKA Babai in Pakistan/Afghanistan), Lohani, Mandori, and Zadran tribes.\n\nIt is significant to note that a large part of above Pathan diaspora have naturalized themselves in the local culture over the centuries.\n\nThe term \"Pathan\" does not refer exclusively and specifically to these Indian Pashtun descendants. Historically the term was used mainly to refer to Pashtuns in general by mainstream Indians Muslims included. Most Pashtuns, however, find the term to be insensitive and prefer to be called by their native label.\n\nMany Pashtuns worked in the Indian independence movement. While many supported the Muslim League's demand for Pakistan, some Pashtuns opposed it in favor of a united and secular India, especially members of the Indian National Congress. These included Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, his son Khan Wali Khan, Indian diplomat Mohammed Yunus, Pakistani opposition leader Mufti Mahmud and Balochistan-based Pashtun leader Abdul Samad Achakzai.\nAlso among the Pashtuns in India are students from Afghanistan who are in India to obtain a quality education, including President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai and Kabuliwallah Pashtuns who are doing business in India. In addition, India has a large number of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Afghanistan who are fluent in Pashto, and Dari.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Pasthuns serving as migrant workers reside in the Middle East, particularly in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and other Arab countries. Many of them are involved in the transport business, while others are employees of construction companies.\n\nOver 100,000 Pashtuns live in Iran as citizens of that country and a further sizable number live among the Afghan refugees. The Pashtuns there are mainly concentrated in the Afghan-Iran border, in the South Khorasan Province of Iran.\n\nAbout 300,000 Pashtuns migrated to the Persian Gulf countries between 1976 and 1981, representing 35% of Pakistani immigrants.\n\nMany Pashtuns have migrated from their homeland in South/Central Asia to Europe.\n\nThe United Kingdom is home to some 100,000 Pashtuns, making it one of the most populous overseas Pashtun communities in the world and the most populous one in the West. Pashtun diaspora in UK have made their presence felt through their restaurants with traditional names like Bab-eKhyber, Hujra, Kabuli pulao etc. and Music. Its one of the most vibrant Pashtun diaspora in the west.\n\nPashtuns have been present in California at least since agricultural labor was imported in the early 20th century. Since the late 1970s and onwards, Pashtuns began immigrating to the USA in large numbers and are well established there. Pashtuns in the United States are famous for running top Afghan cuisine restaurants and as owners of the fast-food restaurant chain Kennedy Fried Chicken that is based in New York City.\n\n1,690 persons characterized their ethnicity as \"Pashtun\" in Canada's 2006 census. However, in question 17 of Canada's Statcan census form most Pashtuns don't put their ethnicity as Pashtuns but rather Afghan or Pakistani.\n\nPashtuns concentrate in regions with large Afghan and Pakistani communities. There are regions in southern Ontario with a large Pashtun diaspora of Pakistani nationality, living Afghan communities with Dari speakers instead of Pashto speakers, causing a large polarization of the word \"Afghan\", especially irridentist disputes claiming Pakistani Pashtun communities as Afghan nationals.\n\nIn the latter part of the 19th century several thousand men from Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Kashmir, Sind, Rajasthan, Egypt, Persia, Turkey and Punjab, but collectively known as \"Afghans\", were recruited during the initial British development of the Australian Outback, especially for the operation of camel trains in desert areas. These consisted of men who were not allowed to bring their families with them, many married local Aborigines and are now known as Ghans. During the 1980s and 90s, Pashtuns began settling in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and other major cities of Australia.\n\nNumerous amounts of Pashtun refugees from Pakistan resettled into East Pakistan (today known as Bangladesh) after the 1947 British Petition, with additional migrants moving in after the Bangladesh Liberation War as well, usually to escape the persecution of ethnic Afghans in Pakistan by the Punjabi majority. Other Pashtuns in Bangladesh are descendants of Pashtun emigrants who settled into Bangladesh during the Pathan rule of the Bengal Sultanate under the Karrani dynasty. Additional Pashtun communities of South Asia are also the Pathans of Sri Lanka, who are believed to have origins from Pathans who settled in Batticaloa, initially arriving for trade.\n\nSince the early 1900s there have been many generations of Pashtuns who migrated from Afghanistan, Pakistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Pashtun settlements in Thailand have been common throughout the provinces. There is even a Thai-Pashtun Friendship Association. The Pashtuns are fiercely independent, as a result they often are well treated and respected by the Thai locals. Countries like Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia also have similar cases of Pashtun settlements, which those who are of descent are quickly assimilated to the local Indian ethnic minority community while those recent migrants or settlers belong to the Pakistani diaspora, since most of the migrants came from Pakistan.\n\nThere may be some Pashtun communities living in parts of China, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nSome people living in Guyana and Suriname claim to be of Afghan descent. Most of them moved to South American countries during the Indian immigration.\n\nMany Pashtuns from Afghanistan came to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Panama, Colombia, Paraguay and Peru as refugees during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1981 and during the internal Afghan conflicts in 1995–1996.\n\n\n"}

In most cases, the reason for those cities' relation with the Saint as their holy Patron is linked to historic events which happened during the \"Reconquista.\"\n\nThe Saint's feast is also celebrated in many towns outside the former Crown of Aragon in Spain. Saint George has been the patron saint of Cáceres, since 1229 A.D. Celebration of Saint George's Day in Cáceres is strongly centred in the world of legends. \nThe saint, also is highly revered in the city of Alcoy, who is the patron saint. In his honor they are celebrated the festival of Moors and Christians. Celebrations include a parade featuring re-enactors of Moorish and Christian soldiers but the core of the commemoration focuses mainly on the legend of Saint George slaying a dragon to save a princess (see: \"Saint George and the Dragon\").\n\nThis is primarily the legend popular all over Europe. For example, in Montblanc – (the region changes Capadoccia kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Georgia, Lithuania, and Greece see Thurston, H., 1909. St. George.) – there was a dragon attacking the land. Scared to death, the inhabitants decided to give two lambs every day to the dragon to satisfy its hunger and prevent attack on the village. But when the animals became scarce it was decided to send a person, chosen by drawing lots, and a lamb. When a family member was devoured by the dragon, the family received a rich compensation from the Kingdom's Treasury.\n\nThere are two versions of the legend at this juncture: \n\nThe king offered the gentleman all the riches imaginable but he preferred that the riches be allocated to the inhabitants of the kingdom. In addition, a church was built in his name, from which flowed miraculous water that was able to heal the sick.\n\nTherefore, in places like Catalonia, Aragón, Balearic and Valencia, or cities like Cáceres (Extremadura) (see Patronages of Saint George) it is customary on 23 April for men give away roses to women, like the knight who addressed the princess. The women give the men a book, remembering the death and burial respectively of two great European literary personalities, Miguel de Cervantes and Shakespeare, and the Spanish notable literary personality, Inca Garcilaso.\n\nAs in the rest of the ancient Crown of Aragon, the Feast of St George is celebrated enthusiastically in the Community of Aragon, being the country's patron saint and its national day. On 23 April, Aragon celebrates its \"Día de Aragón\" (Day of Aragon) in commemoration of the Battle of Alcoraz (\"Baralla d'Alcoraz\" in Aragonese), dated on 1096 Huesca was conquered by the Aragonese army, tradition says that Saint George appeared at a critical moment for the Christian Army, aiding them to win the battle for the \"True Faith\".\n\nAs in Community of Catalonia, roses and books are exchanged among individuals, often bearing ribbons with the colours of Aragon's flag.\n\nLa Diada de Sant Jordi (, Saint George's Day), also known as El Dia de la Rosa (The Day of the Rose) or El Dia del Llibre (The Day of the Book) is on 23 April, since 1926. The main event is the exchange of roses and books between sweethearts, loved ones and colleagues. Historically, men gave women roses, and women gave men a book to celebrate the occasion – \"a rose for love and a book forever.\" In modern times, the mutual exchange of books is also customary. Roses have been associated with this day since medieval times, but the giving of books is a more recent tradition originating in 1923, when a bookseller started to promote the holiday as a way to commemorate the nearly simultaneous deaths of Miguel Cervantes and William Shakespeare on 23 April 1616. Barcelona is the publishing capital of both Catalan and Spanish languages and the combination of love and literacy was quickly adopted.\n\nIn Barcelona's most visited street, La Rambla, and all over Catalonia, thousands of stands of roses and makeshift bookstalls are set up for the occasion. By the end of the day, some six million roses and 800,000 books will have been purchased. Most women will carry a rose in hand, and half of the total yearly book sales in Catalonia take place on this occasion.\n\nThe sardana, the national dance of Catalonia, is performed throughout the day in the Plaça Sant Jaume in Barcelona. Many book stores and cafes host readings by authors (including 24-hour marathon readings of different classics of Catalan literature or Spanish literature). Street performers and musicians in public squares add to the day's atmosphere.\n\n23 April is also one of only three days a year when the Palau de la Generalitat, Barcelona's principal government building, is open to the public. The interior is decorated with roses to honour Saint George.\n\nCatalonia exported its tradition of the book and the rose to the rest of the world. In 1995, UNESCO adopted 23 April as World Book Day.\n\nThe Community of Valencia celebrates St George's Day with a different intensity, though in several zones it has similarities to Valentine's Day, like in Catalonia.\n\nOne notable celebration is in the Valencian city of Alcoi. There, Saint George's Day is commemorated as a thanksgiving celebration for the proclaimed aid the Saint provided to the Christian troops fighting the Muslims in the siege of the city. Its citizens commemorate the day with a festivity in which thousands of people parade in medieval costumes, forming two \"armies\" of Moors and Christians and re-enacting the siege that gave the city to the Christians.\n\n"}

Hurston's sources of information were lore related by Haitians, as well as a few earlier books.\n\nShe described them as a fearsome group of cannibals who performed rites distinct from vodoo practiced by many Hatians. According to Huston, Secte Rouge used counterfeit vodou ceremonies to hide their presence, and moreover that many of the practices abhorred by outsiders and attributed to vodou were actually committed by Secte Rouge (e.g., the robbery or desecration of graves). Hurston provided descriptions of Secte Rouge ceremonies to the gods Maitre Carrefour (Lord of the Cross Roads) and Baron Maitre Cimiterre, a deity involved with graveyards.\n\nThe Secte Rouge was held to have originated among slaves captured in the Mondongue region, now part of the Central African Republic, said to have practiced cannibalism in their homeland. Their behavior was held in check by slavery during the 1700s when France ruled the island, but with the Haitian Revolution and independence in 1804 the Secte Rouge were unleashed. The tenure of President Fabre Geffrard (1859-1867) was said to have been the peak years of the Secte Rouge. Anecdotes include stories of a midwife near who murdered newborn infants specifically to consume their flesh, and human fingernails being discovered in food sold as pig's feet. \n\nHurston relates a conversation with an unidentified \"high official of the Guarde d'Haiti\" who said that police keep suspected Secte Rouge members under surveillance, hoping to gather evidence or observe criminal activity. The Secte Rouge members kept a strict code of secrecy.\n\nTwo earlier works are cited as containing references to the Secte Rouge: \"Description topographique, physique, civile, politique et historique de la partie francaise de l'isle Saint-Domingue (Tome Premier)\" (1796) by Médéric Louis Élie Moreau de Saint-Méry and \"Life in a Haitian Valley\" (1937) by Melville J. Herskovits.\n\nIn \"The Man in the Morgue\" episode 19 of the first season of the TV show Bones (TV series). The secte rouge is portrayed as a group of vodou sorcerers who unbalance the world and seek to do evil.\n\nThe group appears in the Doctor Who spinoff novel \"White Darkness\".\n"}
{"id": "27882375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27882375", "title": "Shirazi people", "text": "Shirazi people\n\nThe Shirazi people, also known as Mbwera, are an ethnic group inhabiting the Swahili coast and the nearby Indian ocean islands. They are particularly concentrated on the islands of Zanzibar, Pemba and Comoros. Their origins are linked to Shiraz and the southwestern coastal region of Persia (now Iran). The Shirazi are notable for helping spread Islam on the Swahili Coast, their role in the establishment of the local Arab-Swahili sultanates, their influence in the development of the Swahili language, and the wealth they accumulated from trading commodities and Bantu-speaking African slaves. The East African coastal area and the nearby islands served as their commercial base.\n\nThere are two main theories about the origins of the Shirazi people. One thesis based on oral tradition states that immigrants from the Shiraz region in southwestern Iran directly settled various mainland ports and islands on the eastern Africa seaboard beginning in the tenth century, in an area between Mogadishu, Somalia in the north and Sofala in the south. According to Irving Kaplan, prior to the 7th century, the coastal areas frequented by the Persian migrants were inhabited by non-Negroid Africans. By the time of the Persian settlement in the area, these earlier occupants had been displaced by incoming Bantu and Nilotic populations. More people from different parts of the Persian Gulf also continued to migrate to the Swahili coast over several centuries thereafter, and these formed the modern Shirazi.\n\nThe second theory on Shirazi origins posits that they came from Persia, but first settled on the Somalia littoral near Mogadishu. In the twelfth century, as the gold trade with the distant entrepot of Sofala on the Mozambique seaboard grew, the settlers are then said to moved southwards to various coastal towns in Kenya, Tanzania, northern Mozambique and the Indian Ocean islands. By 1200 AD, they had established local sultanates and mercantile networks on the islands of Kilwa, Mafia and Comoros along the Swahili coast, and in northwestern Madagascar.\n\nSome academics have questioned the authenticity of the primarily Persian origin claim. They point to the relative rarity of Persian customs and speech, lack of documentary evidence of Shia Islam in the Muslim literature on the Swahili Coast, and instead a historic abundance of Sunni Arab-related evidence. These academics state that the evidence confirms mass migration to the African coast over the centuries from the Persian Gulf and Arabia, but Persian Gulf is much more than a Persian coast. There are also several different versions of stories about the settlement of Shirazi along the Swahili Coast. According to Ari Nave and Irving Kaplan, the Shirazi ethnic group is likely the result of \"a combined African, Arab and Persian\" elements. Jack Drake indicates that through these intermarriages between Persian and Arab male settlers and local Bantu women, the offspring learned Persian and Arab terms related to culture, navigation merchandise, war, artisanal tools, products and travel, as well as Bantu agricultural and daily vocabulary.\n\nThe Shirazi people have been linked to the Lamu Archipelago – islands in the Indian Ocean close to north Kenya, which oral traditions claim were settled by seven brothers from Shiraz in south Iran. The Lamu archipelago descendants then moved south in the 10th and 11th centuries. This is contested and the opposing view states that the Shirazi legend took on new importance in the 19th century, during the period of Omani domination. Claims of Persian Shirazi ancestry were used to distance locals from Arab newcomers. The emphasis that the Shirazi came very long ago and intermarried with indigenous locals is revisionist politics that attempts to fuse the Shirazi origins theory with Swahili heritage according to this view.\n\nThe \"Kilwa Chronicle\", a medieval document written in Arabic, indicates that the early Shirazi also settled in Hanzuan (Anjouan in the Comoros Islands), the Green Island (Pemba), Mandakha, Shaugu and Yanbu. According to the anthropologist Helena Jerman, the Shirazi identity (\"Washirazi\") was born after the arrival of Islam, in the 17th century. Their traditional Bantu lineage names were gradually abandoned and substituted with Arabic family names (e.g. Wapate became Batawiyna), new origin legends and social structures were imagined into folklores, and the societal structures were adopted from Persian and Arab settlers from nearby societies in Asia.\n\nThe Shirazi rulers established themselves on Mrima coast (Kenya) and the Sultan of Kilwa who identified himself as a Shirazi, overthrew the Omani governor in 1771. A French visitor to this Sultanate, named Morice estimated that about a tenth of the population was Swahili-speaking Arabs and Shirazi, a third were free Africans, and the remainder were African slaves.\n\nThe coastal Shirazi sultanates and Swahili-Arab slave traders such as those based in Zanzibar, Kilwa and elsewhere served as a center for ivory and slave trading. These slaves were sourced from interior Africa, such as those around Malawi the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Mozambique.\n\nArab geographers from the twelfth and later centuries historically divided the eastern coast of Africa into several regions based on each region's respective inhabitants. According to the twelfth century geography of Al-Idrisi, completed in 1154 CE, there were four littoral zones: \"Barbar\" (\"Bilad al Barbar\"; \"land of the Berbers\") in the Horn of Africa, which was inhabited by Berbers and stretched southward to the Shebelle river; \"Zanj\" (\"Ard al-Zanj\"; \"country of the blacks\"), located immediately below that up to around Tanga or the southern part of Pemba island; \"Sofala\" (\"Ard Sufala\"), extending from Pemba to an unknown terminus, but probably around the Limpopo river; and \"Waq-Waq\", the shadowy land south thereof. However, earlier geographers make no mention of \"Sofala\". The texts written after twelfth century also call the island of Madagascar \"al-Qumr\", and include it as a part of \"Waq-Waq\".\n\nIslam was introduced to the northern Somalia coast early on from the Arabian peninsula, shortly after the hijra. Zeila's two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest mosque in the city. In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were already living along this northern littoral. He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city. Ibn al-Mujawir later wrote that, due to various battles in the Arabian peninsula, Banu Majid people from Yemen settled in the central Mogadishu area. Yaqut and Ibn Said described the city as another important center of Islam, which actively traded with the Swahili-speaking African region to the south of it. The thirteenth century texts also mention mosques and individuals with names such as \"al-Shirazi\" and \"al-Sirafi\" and a clan called \"Sirafi at Merca\", suggestive of an early Persian presence in the area.\n\nTo the south of the Barbar region, Al-Masudi mentions seaborne trade from Oman and Siraf port near Shiraz to the African Zanj coast, Sofala and Waq-Waq. Ibn Battuta would later visit the Kilwa Sultanate in the 14th century, which was at the time ruled by a Yemeni dynasty led by Sultan Hasan bin Sulayman. Battuta described the local African (negro) inhabitants, who constituted the majority of Kilwa's residents, as \"jet-black\" in complexion and possessing facial tattoo marks. Battuta also described its ruler as often making slave and booty raids on the African idolators as he described the Zanj country. Of the loot, \"a fifth was set aside for the family of the Prophet, and all distributed in the manner prescribed by the Koran\". Despite these raids against the inland African populations, a symbiotic relationship also appears to have existed between the Africans and the coastal people.\n\nAnother set of records are found in the \"Book of the Zanj\" (\"Kitab al-Zanuj\"), a likely compilation of mythical oral traditions and memories of settled traders on the Swahili coast. The late 19th century document claims that Persians and Arabs were sent by governors of the Persian Gulf region to conquer and colonize the trading coast of East Africa. It also mentions the establishment of the Shirazi dynasty by Madagan and Halawani Arab merchants, whose identity and roots are unclear. According to R. F. Morton, a critical assessment of the \"Book of the Zanj\" indicates that much of the document consists of deliberate falsifications by its author Fathili bin Omari, which were intended to invalidate the established oral traditions of local Bantu groups. The \"Kitab\"'s ascription of Arabian origins for the founders of Malindi and other settlements on the Swahili coast is also contradicted by recorded 19th century clan and town traditions, which instead emphasize that these early Shirazi settlers were of Persian ancestral heritage.\n\nThe regional evidence, particularly the gold trading Sofala region of Mozambique, suggests that these Shirazi Persians and Arabs had become rulers of the mainland settlements and islands on the Swahili coast, such as Mafia and Kilwa. The migration of Muslims from diverse parts of Asia continued. According to Abdulaziz Lodhi, the Iranians and Arabs called the Swahili coast \"Zangistan\" or \"Zangibar\", which literally means \"the Black Coast\", and the Muslim immigrants from South Asia (modern Pakistan and India) to southern Arabian lands such as Oman and Yemen identified themselves as a Shirazi. The Muslim Shirazi settlements on the Swahili coast maintained a close relationship with those on islands such as Comoros, through marriage and mercantile networks. According to Tor Sellström, the Comorian population profile has a large proportion of Arab immigrants and African slaves, particularly on Grande Comore and Anjouan and these were under Shirazi sultanates.\n\nThe contact of Shirazi people with colonial Europeans started with the arrival in Kilwa sultanate of Vasco da Gama, the Portuguese explorer, in 1498. Few years later, the Portuguese and Shirazi people entered into disputes regarding trading routes and rights particularly about gold, a conflict that destroyed both Kilwa and Mombasa port towns of Shirazi rulers. The Portuguese military power and direct trading with India in the beginning, followed by other European powers, led to a rapid decline of the Shirazi towns which thrived and depended primarily on the trade. In parallel to European competition, non-Swahili-speaking Bantu groups began attacking Shirazi towns in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Thus, the Shirazi sultanates faced war from sea and land, leading to a rapid loss of power and trading facilities. The Omani Arabs re-asserted their military in the seventeenth century, and they defeated the Portuguese in 1698, at Mombasa. The Portuguese agreed to cede this part of Africa, and a fresh migration of Arabs from Oman and Yemen into the Shirazi people settlements followed.\n\nSome towns and islands have had a much larger concentration of Shirazi people. For example, in 1948, about 56% of the Zanzibar population reported Shirazi ancestry of Persian origins. In local elections, the Shirazi voted for whichever party was politically expedient, whether the ethnic minority-supported Zanzibar Nationalist Party or the mainland Tanzania-associated Afro-Shirazi Party.\n\nGenetic analysis by Msadie et al. (2010) indicates that the most common paternal lineages among the contemporary Comorian population, which includes Shirazi people, are clades that are frequent in sub-Saharan Africa (E1b1a-M2 (41%) and E2-M90 (14%)). The samples also contain some northern Y chromosomes, indicating possible paternal ancestry from South Iran (E1b1b-V22, E1b1b-M123, F*(xF2, GHIJK), G2a, I, J1, J2, L1, Q1a3, R1*, R1a*, R1a1 and R2 (29.7%)), and Southeast Asia (O1 (6%)). The Comorians also predominantly bear mitochondrial haplogroups linked with sub-Saharan East African populations in East and South East Africa (L0, L1, L2 and L3′4(xMN) (84.7%)), with the remaining maternal clades associated with Southeast Asia (B4a1a1-PM, F3b and M7c1c (10.6%) and M(xD, E, M1, M2, M7) (4%)) but no Middle Eastern lineages. According to Msadie et al., given that there are no common Middle Eastern maternal haplogroups on the Comoros, there is \"striking evidence for male-biased gene flow from the Middle East to the Comoros\", which is \"entirely consistent with male-dominated trade and religious proselytisation being the forces that drove the Middle Eastern gene flow to the Comoros\".\n\nThe Shirazi people adhere to Islam. They follow the Sunni and Shia denominations. Most Swahili-speaking Muslims in the traditional Swahili cultural hubs follow the Shafi'i madhab of Sunni Islam.\n\nLike the rest of the Swahili people, the Shirazi speak the Swahili language as a mother tongue. It belongs to the Bantu branch of the Niger-Congo family. However, the dialects of Swahili language is best described as a syncretic language, that blended Sabaki Bantu, Comoro, Pokomo, Iranian, Arabic and Indian words and structure reflecting the syncretic fusion of people from diverse backgrounds that form the Shirazi people.\n\nAccording to \"Ethnologue\", the Comorian Swahili variety is divided into four principal dialects: Ngazidja, Ndzwani, Maore and Mwawli. Ngazidja is spoken on the Grande Comore Autonomous Island, and has around 312,000 total speakers. Ndzwani is spoken on the Anjouan Autonomous Island, and has roughly 275,000 total speakers. Maore is spoken on the Comoros, Mayotte and Madagascar islands, and has an estimated 136,500 total speakers. Mwali is spoken on the Moheli Autonomous Island, and has about 28,700 total speakers.\n\nSpeakers of the Ngazidja, Ndzwani, and Maore Comorian dialects use the Naskh variant of the Arabic script as their writing system.\n\nThe Shirazi people have primarily been a mercantile community, thriving on trade. Initially, between the 10th and 12th centuries, it was the gold producing regions of Mozambique that brought them to the coast of Africa. Later the trading in African slaves, ivory, spices, silk and produce from clove, coconut and other plantations run with slave labor became the mainstay of the trading activity. These African slaves were captured during inland raids. Their presence in Swahili towns is mentioned in fourteenth and fifteenth century memoirs of Islamic travelers such as that of the fourteenth century explorer Ibn Battuta. The Shirazi were a large supplier of these slaves to the colonial era European plantations and various Sultanates. According to August Nimtz, after international slave trading was banned, the Shirazi community was economically crippled.\n\nThe arrival of Islam with the Persians and Arabs affected the Shirazi identity and social structures in many ways. According to Helena Jerman, the word \"Sawahil\" among the Shirazi people referred to \"free but landless\" strata of the society who had adopted Islam, then a new social category on the Swahili coast. Among the Muslims, this was the lowest social strata of free people, just above the slave strata. Along with the \"Wa-shirazi\" strata, there were other strata, such as the \"Wa-arabu\", \"Wa-manga\", \"Wa-shihiri\", \"Wa-shemali\", and the noble pure Arab ruler category called \"Wa-ungwana\". The social strata of the Shirazi people came with its own strata taboos and privileges. For example, the upper strata Waungwana (also called \"Swahili-Arabs\") had the exclusive right to build prestigious stone houses, and Waungwana men practiced polygynous hypergamy, that is father children with low status and slave women. The ritual and sexual purity of the Waungwana women were maintained by confining them to certain premises within these houses, called \"Ndani\".\n\nAccording to Michel Ben Arrous and Lazare Ki-Zerbo, the Shirazi society has been \"fractured by the caste implications of race and class\". As the Arabs who arrived from Persia and Arabian lands became slave owners and traders, they considered their slaves as inferior and unfit for Islam. The slave girls were concubines, who bore them children. The male offspring were considered Muslims, but the female offspring inherited their slavery and their non-Muslim heritage. Even in post-colonial society, the residual dynamics and distinctions of a racial caste system have remained among some Shirazi people. According to the sociologist Jonas Ewald and other scholars, the social stratification is not limited in the Shirazi society to racial lines, but extends to economic status and the region of origin.\n\nThe Shirazi culture is Islamic in nature, identifying largely with its Persian and Arabic roots. There are also Bantu influences, such as the Swahili language.\n\nAccording to G. Thomas Burgess, Ali Sultan Issa and Seif Sharif Hamad, many Africans \"claimed Shirazi identity to obscure their slave ancestry, to mark their status as landowners, or to gain access to World War II rations distributed by the colonial state along ethnic lines.\" Shirazi consider themselves as of Persian ancestry primarily, and more consistently regard themselves as neither Arabs nor recent labor migrants from mainland Africa.\n\n\n"}

This is because, from a functionalist perspective, a sick individual is not a productive member of society. Therefore this deviance needs to be policed, which is the role of the medical profession. Genuinely, Parsons argued that the best way to understand illness sociologically is to view it as a form of deviance which disturbs the social function of the society.\n\nThe general idea is that the individual who has fallen ill is not only physically sick, but now adheres to the specifically patterned social role of being sick. ‘Being Sick’ is not simply a ‘state of fact’ or ‘condition’, it contains within itself customary rights and obligations based on the social norms that surround it. The theory outlined two rights of a sick person and two obligations:\n\n\nThere are three versions of sick role: \n\n\n"}

During her husband's minority, the bride often had to tolerate advances of her assertive father-in-law. For example, in the middle of the 19th century in Tambov Governorate 12-13 year old boys were often married to 16-17 year old girls. The boys' fathers used to arrange such marriages to take advantage of their sons' lack of experience. \"Snokhachestvo\" entailed conflicts in the family and put moral pressure on the mother-in-law, who usually treated her son's wife as a rival for her own husband's affections.\n\n\"Snokachestvo\" was considered incestuous by the Russian Orthodox Church and unseemly by the \"obshchina\", the rural community. Legally it was considered a form of rape and was punished with fifteen to twenty lashes. Understandably, cases of \"snokhachestvo\" were not publicized and the crime remained latent, making it difficult to assess its true extent in the Russian Empire.\n\nOne of the first Russian writers to decry \"snokhachestvo\", describing it as a form of \"sexual debasement,\" was Alexander Radishchev, who saw it as an outgrowth of Russian serfdom. In the 19th century, its resurgence was fueled by obligatory conscription and \"the seasonal departure of young men for work outside the village.\"\n\n\"Snokhachestvo\" remained relatively widespread even after the abolition of serfdom in 1861. Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, a jurist, resented the fact that \"nowhere it seems, except Russia, has at least one form of incest assumed the character of an almost normal everyday occurrence, designated by the appropriate technical term.\" The Narodnik writer Gleb Uspensky, while deploring the plight of young peasant women, sympathized with \"the emotional and physical needs of the mature peasant man.\"\n\nThere are sexual connotations in the relationship between Katerina and her father-in-law in Shostakovich's 1934 opera \"Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District\", but not in the 1865 story it is based upon.\n\nIn 1927, Olga Preobrazhenskaia, \"the leading woman director of fiction films in the twenties,\" and her co-director, Ivan Pravov, released a film condemning \"snokhachestvo\". Titled \"The Peasant Women of Riazan\" (in Russian, \"Baby ryazanskie\"), the silent film is about the rape and pregnancy of a woman whose husband is away in World War I. The rapist is her father-in-law, and the woman, overcome by shame, drowns herself when her husband returns from battle.\n"}

{"id": "7972817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7972817", "title": "White Brazilians", "text": "White Brazilians\n\nWhite Brazilians ( ) refers to Brazilian citizens of European and Levantine descent who are perceived to be and identify as white. According to the 2010 Census, they totaled 91,051,646 people, and made up 47.73% of the Brazilian population. The main ancestry of White Brazilians is Portuguese, followed by Italian, Spanish, German and other German-speaking nationalities (Austrian, Swiss, Luxembourger and Volga German), Slavic (Polish, Ukrainian, Russian etc), Arabs Levantine (Syrians, Palestinians and Lebanese), Greeks, French, Armenian, Scandinavian, Finnish and British.\n\nThe states with the highest percentage of white citizens are: Santa Catarina (83,8%), Rio Grande do Sul (82,3%), Paraná (70,0%), and São Paulo (63,1%). Other states with significant rates are: Rio de Janeiro (54,5%), Mato Grosso do Sul (51,1%), Espírito Santo (44,2%), Minas Gerais (45,4%) and Goiás (37,2%). São Paulo has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million whites.\n\nThe Brazilian concept of \"white race\" might be somewhat different from the concept of \"white race\" in other countries since race is seen in a spectrum, with different races being perceived as assorted series of continua, but the same concepts can be found in other New World countries or former European colonies like Australia. A comprehensive study presented by the \"Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research\" found that on average, white Brazilians are (>83%) European.\nAnother autosomal study carried out by the geneticist Sergio Pena showed that the overwhelming ancestry of \"white\" Brazilians is European.\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study (from 2009) conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the \"whites\" from a sample of just 90 students (who thought of themselves as \"very mixed\") were found to carry very little Amerindian or African admixtures (generally about 90% European in ancestry on average). \"The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self-made estimates of European ancestry\", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than those students had thought it would be. The \"pardos\" were found to have a European ancestry on average of 80% (autosomal ancestry) However this study, a random sample of 90 students, 30 of whom had classified themselves as white, 30 as brown, and 20 as black, although important in understanding racial categorizations in Brazil in no way represents the genetic makeup of the entire population of this nation that is the fifth largest in the world by territory and whose different regions were populated by different ethnic groups during different historical periods.\n\nThe degree of miscegenation in Brazil varies according to region, being particularly high in the Northeast region, the first to receive large European waves during the colonial period; Brazil was originally colonised only by a few families of Portuguese settlers in the first decades of the 16th century, with some French families included; instead there were many mostly Portuguese individual male adventurers, who tended to reproduce with Amerindian females at first and later with African females, even though the Crown had sent female orphans under royal custody during the colonial period to marry Portuguese male settlers; with noblemen marrying the ones whose fathers had died serving abroad in the military especially in Asian colonies. The later settlers from the largest European influx after the discovery of gold and diamonds in Central Brazil post both brazilwood and sugarcane economical cycles, however, would tend also to reproduce with women who were the product of previous miscegenation in Brazil, besides the European female immigrants to whom they were married. According to a genealogical and demographic study carried out by the sociologist Mario Jaramillo e Contreras, member of the Junta Directiva de la Real Asociación de Hidalgos de España, a non-profitable apolitical organization, over 15% of Latin Americans today descend from Iberian nobles who migrated to the Americas during the colonial period after the conceptual three \"G\"s, gold, God and glory, meaning financial success and military fame and renown, besides bringing new converted souls to the Church.\n\nHowever, social prejudice connected to certain details in the physical appearance of individual is widespread. Those details are related to the concept of \"cor\". \"Cor\", Portuguese for \"color\" denotes the Brazilian rough equivalent of the term \"race\" in English, but is based on a complex phenotypic evaluation that takes into account skin pigmentation, hair type, nose shape, and lip shape. This concept, unlike the English notion of \"race\", captures the continuous aspects of phenotypes. Thus, it seems there is no racial descent rule operational in Brazil; it is even possible for two siblings to belong to completely diverse \"racial\" categories.\nAlthough in the most recent census, with the increased valorisation of indigenous, mixed, black, anusim and gipsy or romani heritage thanks to affirmative action, large numbers of mixed mestizo, castizo, eurasians or mixed white + black, as well as black Brazilians selected black and mixed even with higher socioeconomic status, who probably would've selected white or mixed in the 2000 Census, thus giving a clearer picture on Brazil's demographic makeup. Notwithstanding the new consciousness, the fact that the fertility rate in Brazil has dropped considerably in the last decades, especially among European descendants, Jews, Levantines and Japanese-Brazilians reaching below replacement rates can also be counted as an additional factor.\n\nThe following are the results for the different Brazilian censuses, since 1872:\n\nIn the past, ancestry was quite irrelevant for racial classifications in Brazil. A survey in Rio de Janeiro also concluded that \"racial-purity\" is not important for a person to be classified as white in Brazil. The survey asked respondents if they had any ancestors who were European, African or Amerindian. As much as 52% of those whites reported they have some non-European ancestry: 23% reported to have some Black African ancestry and 29% reported Amerindian ancestry (15% of them reported to have both). Only 56% of those whites did not report any nonwhite ancestry. Thus, in Brazil, one can self-identify as white and still have African or Amerindian ancestry, and such a person has no problem admitting to having nonwhite ancestors.\nThe most recent census in 2010, showed a shift in mentality, where mixed Brazilians whose DNA might have European markers in a range spanning from 70% to 85%, overwhelmingly chose to identify with their mixed racial background, rather than white. These backgrounds being predominantly Caboclo or mestiço, known in the Spanish-speaking world as Mestizo and Castizo for the most part, but also black and white mix, or black plus Native plus white, what in the past was known as Octoroon, as well as Romani or Gipsy, Anusim or Dutch and Lusitanian Crypto Jew, and Eurasian or Hāfu and ainoko. Affirmative action and identity valorisation being factors, albeit fertility rate among European ancestry, Levantine and Jewish citizens plummeting being another factor part of the equation.\nGiven this ambiguity and fluidity, there are people who claim that the few racial categories offered by the IBGE are not enough. When Brazilians answer to open-ended questions about race, up to 143 different race-color terms are brought. The most common is \"moreno\", a category that refers to a wide spectrum of phenotypes. It can mean \"dark-haired\", \"tawny\", \"suntanned\", but it is also used as a euphemism for \"pardo\" and \"black\", according to context. It is not a synonym with \"pardo\", however, since each word refers to widely different sets of people.\n\nAn important factor about whiteness in Brazil is the racial stigma of being Amerindian or black, which is undesirable and avoided for a large part of the population. Scientific racism largely influenced race relations in Brazil since the late 19th century. The predominant nonwhite, mostly Afro-Brazilian population was seen as a problem for Brazil in the eyes of the predominantly white elite of the country. In contrast to some countries, like the United States or South Africa, which tried to avoid miscegenation, even imposing anti-miscegenation laws, in Brazil, miscegenation was always legal. What was expected was that miscegenation would eventually turn all Brazilians into whites.\n\nAs a result of that desire of whitening its own population, the Brazilian ruling classes encouraged the arrival of massive European immigration to the country. In the 1890s 1.2 million European immigrants were added to the country's 5 million whites. Today the Brazilian areas with larger proportions of whites tend to have been destinations of massive European immigration between 1880 and 1930.\n\nEven though expectations of the Brazilian elite to whiten its own population through European immigration came to an end in the 1930s, the whitening ideology still influences racial relations in Brazil today. In general, the population still expects that blacks must biologically whiten themselves by marriage with lighter skinned people, or culturally through the assimilation of the traditions of the dominant white population. That leads mixed-race people to be perceived as whites, and this is more evident when a nonwhite person becomes wealthier and is incorporated in the ruling classes.\n\nFor example, Brazilian writer, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, was a mulatto. However, once he gained fame and prestige, people started to accept him as a white man, and on his death certificate he was classified as a \"white man\". Better educated and wealthier Brazilians usually see themselves as whites (a strict association between wealth and whiteness). A study showed that when mixed-race Brazilians get wealthier they start to be perceived as whites by others, who usually avoid associating a wealthy person with a non-white racial category. But only mixed-race people can \"become white\" when they get richer, while typically black people will always be perceived as blacks, no matter how rich they get.\n\nIt showed that less educated black Brazilians avoid being associated as Black (usually choosing the word \"Moreno\": literally \"tanned\", \"brunette\", \"with an olive complexion\" to classify themselves). Better-educated black Brazilians, however, are more than eight times more likely as persons of a low level of education to identify themselves as blacks, while better educated mixed-race people usually jump to the white category. Research published by the American Sociological Review found that the growth of the pardo population would be in part due to large numbers of blacks \"whitening\" themselves by reporting to be brown (mulatto). Studies have found a large trend in reclassification (whitening) from black to brown in the 1950 to 1980 period, a much smaller one from white to pardo, and a similar but less pronounced pattern between 1980 and 1990. Academics attribute this switch from black to pardo to high rates of black upward mobility during the 1970s, consistent with a \"money whitens\" hypothesis, that is blacks would whiten themselves by reporting as pardo the more wealthy they become. These results would demonstrate a tendency for what is called branqueamento, that means that blacks would tend to self-classify as whiter. In this case, differences found in the share of blacks between census results would demonstrate that blacks tend to self-classify as pardos. Some researchers suggested to merge the two into a single Afro-Brazilian category (e.g., Lovell 1994; Wood and Carvalho 1988; Wood and Lovell 1992). Brazilian geneticist Sérgio Pena has criticised American scholar Edward Telles for lumping \"pretos\" and \"pardos\" in the same category. According to him, \"the autosomal genetic analysis that we have performed in non-related individuals [...] shows that it does not make any sense to put \"pretos\" and \"pardos\" in the same category\".\n\nThe integration of races in Brazil did not build a racial democracy, where racism would not exist because all Brazilians saw themselves as equal because of their common multiracial heritage. Even though this theory was dominant in Brazil for decades, although it is still followed by some today, most scholars now think that miscegenation in Brazil created not an egalitarian society but a society where lighter-skinned people are found mostly on the top and the darker-skinned are mostly found on the bottom.\n\nBrazil received more European settlers during its colonial era than any other country in the Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 European immigrants in the United States.\n\nPractically all Europeans coming to Brazil before 1818 were Portuguese. Available data seems to point that most Portuguese settlers in Brazil came from northern Portugal, especially from Minho (in 1801, 45% of the Portuguese established in São Paulo were \"minhotos\", 20% from the Azores Islands, 16% from Lisbon and 19% from other parts). Another significant portion came from the Portuguese Atlantic Island of Madeira.\n\nAn important feature of the Portuguese colonization was the overwhelming predominance of males. This disproportion was a problem during much of the colonial period. The Portuguese Crown even sent orphaned women under royal wardship for marriage with the settlers known as Órfãs d'El-Rei, but a large part of the settlers were involved in relationships with indigenous women and African slaves. It is remarkable that most Portuguese settlers arrived in Brazil in the 18th century: 600,000 in a period of only 60 years. The exploitation of gold and diamonds in the region of Minas Gerais has been a crucial factor in the arrival of this contingent of colonists.\n\nThe \"New Christians\" was a term used to refer to Portuguese Jews who converted to Roman Catholicism, and their known baptized descendants. Portugal has always had a sizable Jewish community inhabiting its territory. There was a healthy degree of acceptance and tolerance towards Jewish religion, language and culture. However, after the inquisition set a foothold in Spain about 120.000 Jews fled to Portugal where King John II sold them a residency. Five years later, as the Inquisition gained momentum in Portugal, all people of Jewish ancestry were forced to be baptized and became the New Christians. Many moved from Portugal and established themselves in Brazil. Some of the most common Portuguese New Christian surnames were: Cardozo, Pereira, Henriques, Pimentel, Silva, Oliveira, Machado, Tavares, Lima, Mascarenhas, Nogueira, Pinto, Coutinho, Rodrigues, Mendes, Teixeira, Nunes, Pacheco, Dias, Alvares, Fernándes, Furtado, Sousa, Castro, Morais, Miranda, Ribeiro, Noronha, Vasconcelos, etc. According to researcher Flávio Mendes de Carvalho in his book The Jewish Roots of Brazil, between 25% and 35% of the Brazilian population descends from these New Christians, which is the equivalent of 66 million people.\n\nBefore the 19th century, the French invaded twice, establishing brief and minor settlements (Rio de Janeiro, 1555–60; Maranhão, 1612–15); In 1630, the Dutch made the most significant attempt to seize Brazil from Portuguese control. At the time, Portugal was in a dynastic union with Spain, and the Dutch hostility against Spain was transferred to Portugal. The Dutch were able to control most of the Brazilian Northeast then the most dynamic part of Brazil for about a quarter century, but were unable to change the ethnic makeup of the colonizing population, which remained overwhelmingly Portuguese by origin and culture. Sephardic Jews of Portuguese origin moved from Amsterdam to New Holland; but in 1654, when the Portuguese regained control of Brazil, most of them were expelled, as well as most of the Dutch settlers. A group of Dutch and Portuguese Jews then moved to North America, forming a Jewish community in New Amsterdam, today's New York city, while a few of the Dutch colonists settled in the highlands in the countryside of Pernambuco known as Borborema Plateau, a region part of the ecosystem known as \"agreste\" between the coastal forest \"zona da mata\" and the semiarid \"sertão\" in the Northeast.\n\nAside these military attempts, a very small number of non-Portuguese people appear to have managed to enter Brazil from European countries other than Portugal.\n\nHowever, in the Southern Brazilian areas disputed between Portugal and Spain, Spanish colonists largely contributed for the ethnic formation of the local population, denominated Gaúchos. A genetic research conducted by FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo) on Gaúchos from Bagé and Alegrete, in Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, revealed that they are mostly descended from Portuguese and Spanish ancestors, with 52% of them having Amerindian MtDNA (similar to that found in people who live in the area of the Amazon rainforest, and significantly higher than the national average 33% among Brazilian whites) and 11% African MtDNA. Another study also concluded that for the formation of the Gaúcho there was a predominance of Iberians, particularly Spaniards. To evaluate the extension of Gaucho genetic diversity of the Gauchos, and retrieve part of their history, a study with 547 individuals, of which 278 were Native Americans (Guarani and Kaingang) and 269 admixed from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, was carried out. The genetic finding matches with the explanation of sociologist Darcy Ribeiro about the ethnic formation of the Brazilian Gaúchos: they are mostly the result of the miscegenation of Spanish and Portuguese males with Amerindian females.\n\nAnother genetic study found possible relics of the 17th-century Dutch invasion in Northeastern Brazil.\n\nIt was only in 1818 that the Portuguese rulers abandoned the principle of restricting settling in Brazil to Portuguese nationals. In that year over two thousand Swiss migrants from the Canton of Fribourg arrived to settle in an inhospitable area near Rio de Janeiro that would later be renamed Nova Friburgo.\n\nThe arrival of German immigrants had great importance for the demographics of Southern Brazil. They founded rural communities that later became prosperous cities, as was the case of São Leopoldo, Joinville and Blumenau.\n\nThe end of the slave trade (1850) and the abolition of slavery (1888) prompted the Brazilian State to promote European immigration to Brazil. The production of coffee, the main product of Brazil at the time, began to suffer a shortage of workers. From 1876, Italian immigrants began to enter Brazil in huge numbers. From 1884 to 1933, 1.4 million Italians immigrated to Brazil, 70% of whom settled in São Paulo.\n\nThe period of the great immigration, between 1876 and 1930, brought to the country more than 5 million Europeans. Most were Italians and Portuguese, followed by Spaniards, Germans, Poles, and Ukrainians. It is notable that most of these immigrants settled in Southern and Southeastern Brazil.\n\nBrazilian demographers have long discussed the demographic impact of the wave of emigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. According to Judicael Clevelário, most studies about the impact of immigration have followed Giorgio Mortara's conclusions in the 40's and 50's. Mortara concluded that only about 19% of the demographic growth of Brazil, from 1840 and 1940 was due to immigration, and that the population of immigrant origin was of 16% of the total population of Brazil.\n\nHowever, according to Clevelário, Mortara failed to properly take into account the full endogenous growth of the population of immigrant origin, due to the predominantly rural settlement of the immigrants (rural regions tend to have higher natality rates than cities). Clevelário, then, besides extending the calculations up to 1980, remade them, reaching somewhat different conclusions.\n\nOne of the problems of calculating the impact of immigration in Brazilian demography is that the return rates of immigrants are unknown. Clevelário, thence, supposed four different hypotheses concerning the return rates. The first, that he deems unrealistically high, is that 50% of the immigrants to Brazil returned to their countries of origin. The second is based on the work of Arthur Neiva, who supposes the return rate for Brazil was higher than that of USA (30%) but lower than that of Argentina (47%). The third hypothesis is taken from Mortara, who postulates a rate of 20% for the 19th century, 35% for the first two decades of the 20th century, and 25% for 1920 onwards. Although Mortara himself considered this hypothesis underestimated, Clevelário thinks it is the closest to reality. The last hypothesis, also admittedly unrealistic, is that of a 0% rate of return, which is known to be false.\n\nClevelário's conclusions are as follows: considering hypothesis 1 (unrealistically high), the Population of Immigrant Origin in 1980 would be 14,730,710 people, or 12.38% of the total population. Considering hypothesis 2 (based on Neiva), it would be 17,609,052 people, or 14.60% of the total population. Considering hypothesis 3 (based on Mortara, and considered most realistic), it would be 22,088,829 people, or 18.56% of the total population. Considering hypothesis 4 (no return at all), the Population of Immigrant origin would be 29,348,423 people, or 24.66% of the total population\n\nClevelário believes the most probable number to be close to 18%, higher than Mortara's previous estimate of 1947.\n\nAccording to the Census of 1872, Black and \"Brown\" people made up the majority (58%) of Brazil's population. The white population grew faster than the non-White population due to the subsidized immigration of Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1890, the African-descended population was reduced to 47% and the Amerindian to 9%. The disproportionally fast growth of the white population, due to mass immigration, lasted until 1940, when its proportion in the Brazilian population peaked at 63.5%.\n\nAccording to a genetic study, the European immigration to Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries left a \"strong imprint\" in the genetics of the Brazilian population, leading to the \"whitening\" of Brazil. The massive European immigration promoted by the Brazilian government after 1872 that brought nearly 6 million Europeans in order to \"whiten\" the country's population had an important effect, and it manifests in a predominance (over 70%) of European ancestry in white Brazilian, as well as a large European admixture (37.1%) in Black Brazilians. The scholars divided the formation of the Brazilian population into three periods: the first when the country was inhabited only by Amerindians, who contributed for the early formation of the population; the second was during the large influx of slaves from Africa until 1850 and the third was during the large influx of European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In fact, until the mid-19th-century, white people never exceeded 30% of the population in Brazil, while Caboclos, Amerindians, Blacks and Mulattoes always predominated.\n\nAnother study has pointed out that the European ancestry is dominant throughout Brazil at 80%, which means that even in the states not hit by the most recent waves of immigration, European ancestry dominates in the population as a whole. \"A new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine 'American Journal of Human Biology' by a team of the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies\".\n\nWhite Brazilians are descended either from colonial settlers, who came from Portugal from 1500 to 1822, or from the diverse groups of immigrants who arrived after independence. The latter had a greater impact in the demography of the Southern states and of São Paulo.\n\nDifferent from the colonists who settled in North America, who brought their entire families, the Portuguese colonization was almost exclusively composed of men, with a limited presence of women. This lack of women worried the Jesuits, who asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies such as Down Syndrome) if necessary. The Crown responded by sending several groups of Iberian orphan maidens to marry both cohorts of marriageable men, the nobles and the peasants. Some of which were even primarily studying to be nuns. The Crown also shipped over many Órfãs d'El-Rei of what was considered \"good birth\" to colonial Brazil to marry Portuguese settlers of high rank. \"Órfãs d'El-Rei\" (modern Portuguese \"órfãs do rei\") literally translates to \"Orphans of the King\", and they were Portuguese girl orphans in nubile age. There were noble and non-noble maidens and they were daughters of military compatriots who died in battle for the king or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown. Bahia's port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551. But most of the first Portuguese settlers also procreated with native Amerindians or African slave women. Over time, the number of Portuguese women immigrating to Brazil grew, but the gender imbalance was never significantly reduced. This male predominance prevailed throughout the colonial period. Historically, the male Portuguese settler preferred to marry a Portuguese born female. But, since their number in Brazil was very small, the second option was to marry a white Brazilian, born to Portuguese parents. The third option was a white Brazilian female of distant Portuguese origin. The scarce presence of white women, either Portuguese or Brazilian, caused the high degree of miscegenation in colonial Brazil.\n\nEven though the immigration of non-Portuguese was allowed from 1818 on, the Portuguese predominance continued way up to the 1870 years. A consistent flux of German immigrants started to arrive to Southern Brazil, briefly interrupted by the Ragamuffin War, but the amount of Portuguese immigrants was much bigger during this period.\n\nThe census of 1872, counted 3,787,289 whites in Brazil. Despite the largest arrivals of European immigrants, particularly between 1880 and 1930, the nowadays white Brazilian population has a considerable proportion of citizens that are still mainly descended from whites of colonial extraction (Lusitanians but also Spaniards, Dutch, French, Anusim and others), especially those groups in the Northeast, the borders of Rio Grande do Sul with Argentina and Uruguay, and the Center-West, with the exception of Mato Grosso do Sul, partially populated by Italian, German and Polish farmers from São Paulo and the South, just like the case of Brasiguaios, Brazilian landowners in Paraguay.\n\nSouth American oligarchies, which remained predominantly of European origin, believed in syntony with the racialist theories then widespread in Europe that the large numbers of blacks and mixed Amerindians that made up the majority of the population were a handicap to the development of their countries. As a result, countries such as Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil started to encourage the arrival of European immigrants, in order to make the white population grow and to dilute the African and Amerindian blood in their population. Argentina even has an article in its Constitution prohibiting any attempt to prevent the entry of European immigrants in the country. In the case of Brazil, the immigrants started arriving in huge numbers during the 1880s. From 1886 to 1900, almost 1.4 million Europeans arrived, of whom over 900,000 were Italians. During this period of 14 years, Brazil received more Europeans than during the over 300 years of colonization.\n\nAccording to Darcy Ribeiro before 1850 no more than 500,000 Europeans settled in Brazil IBGE estimated that the number was close to 700,000 Portuguese during the 18th century. The mass European immigration to Brazil only started in the second half of the 19th century, from 1850 to 1970 over 6 million Europeans arrived, because of three main reasons:\n\n\nThese immigrants had a larger and more visible impact in the state of São Paulo, along with the three southern states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Paraná. In the southern states there were entire regions (such as the Serra Gaúcha and Vale do Jacuí) populated by German and Italian-speaking inhabitants. The immigrants remained closed in ethnic communities for decades. The Portuguese language only started to be used by these communities many decades after their arrival, as a result of their contact with Brazilians and with immigrants from other countries, but also because of the forced assimilation during the Getúlio Vargas's government, mostly inside the German community. In contrast to the early Portuguese colonists, these immigrants arrived with their entire families in Brazil, with large numbers of women and children. As a result, the areas where they were concentrated, most remarkably the central parts of Southern Brazil, became predominantly white.\n\nIn São Paulo, paulistas of Italian descent outnumbered those of earlier extraction. In this region, Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards and Arabs were easily integrated, since they had a close contact with the large local Brazilian population. At first working on coffee farms, later they moved to cities and participated in the process of industrialization of Brazil.\n\nThe first economic activity the Portuguese crown devised in Brazil—the collection of Brazilwood—was not conducive to an actual occupation of the territory. The establishment of a few \"feitorias\" that conducted the trade was not enough to populate Brazil. The growing competition from other colonial powers—especially France—led the Portuguese into finding other economic activities that could serve as a base for a permanent and solid integration of Brazil into Portuguese domains. The first such activity to attain success was the cultivation of sugarcane—and the associated extraction of sugar, since sugarcane could not be transported overseas without deteriorating. This activity was also complementary with the slave trade that the Portuguese were starting, at that moment, from their African colonies of Angola and Mozambique. Sugarcane proved very well adapted to the climate of the Northeastern litoral, so the first stable and prosperous Portuguese settlements—and consequently, the first stable and prosperous centers of white population in Brazil—where located in that region.\n\nThe economy of sugarcane culture being centered in exporting to Portugal, other economic activities appeared to fulfill the necessities of the region. Remarkably, husbandry spread into the arid hinterland, where it remained the most important economic activity for centuries.\n\nThe region around São Vicente, in modern São Paulo state, remained less developed, with a weaker integration to the colonial economy. This probably prompted the inhabitants to explore the hinterland. In theory looking for gold and gems, in practice they engaged in expeditions with the objective of capturing and enslaving Amerindians. These slaves were used in the incipient agriculture around São Paulo, which, to the end of the 16th century became specialised in wheat, as a commercial crop that could be sold in other parts of Brazil. \n\nAround 1700, the paulistas found gold in the region that is now Minas Gerais. Together with the growing competition of Caribbean sugar, this made the center of the Brazilian economy move to the Southwest. The administrative center of the colony was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The discovery of mineral wealth caused the influx of Portuguese settlers to redirect from the Northeast to the mining region, and the number of Portuguese leaving for Brazil to increase greatly; also there was a change in the social profile of those coming to Brazil. Agriculture needed substantial investments, but gold mining required much more courage and less initial capital, and the proportion of poor Portuguese among the newcomers increased considerably.\n\nThe Southern region was also first settled by the paulistas. Arriving there in search of the Amerindians in the Jesuit reductions, they subsequently raided the region in search of the cattle gone astray with the destruction of the Missões, first for the leather, then organising a commercial circuit that moved cattle on feet to the mining region (\"ciclo do gado a pé\"). As a result, the Portuguese domain extended firmly to the south, threatening the control of the Northern bank of the Plata by the Spanish.\n\nMost of the 6.831.000 European immigrants that entered the country between 1821 and 1932 settled in São Paulo (state) and other Southeastern states: São Paulo received most of the Italians (Veneto, Lombardy, Campania, Tuscany, Calabria, Liguria, Piedmont, Umbria, Emilia-Romagna, Abruzzi e Molise and Basilicata) and Spaniards (Galicians, Castilians and Catalans) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and from the 1910s on most of the Lithuanians, Dutch, French, Hungarians, Baltic Finns, Ashkenazi Jews (from Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Lithuania, Russia and Czechoslovakia), Latvians, Greeks, Armenians, Czech, Croatians, Slovenians, Bulgarians, Albanians and Georgians; Rio de Janeiro (state) received most of the Portuguese immigrants followed by SP, as well as most of the Swiss and Belgians. Together with São Paulo and Santa Catarina, RJ was one of the main destinations for Swedes, Norwegians, Danes but also French and received the second largest number of Jews after SP. São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro followed by Paraná also received most of the English-Welsh and Scots; The countryside of Espírito Santo was mainly populated by people arriving from Germany, especially Pomeranians (Prussia), Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Denmark, Luxembourg, France, Romania, Slovakia and Iberia, comprising chiefly Catalans but including Basques and Andorrans. Minas Gerais received generally Italians, looking for arable acreage in the 19th century, and Portugueses early in the 18th during the Gold and Diamond Rush. MG was also destination for Germans, Czech, Bulgarians, Romanians, Hungarians, Ashkenazi Jews, Spaniards, Serbians, Greeks, Armenians and part of the additional 170k Lebanese who settled the country.\n\nHowever, the impact of the European immigration was larger in Southern Brazil, because even though it got a lesser migration, since it had a very small population, the immigration's impact was greater to its demography when compared to other Brazilian regions. The main concentrations in Rio Grande do Sul were Venetian Italians where their dialect is still spoken and Germans from the Hunsrück region of Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate) who also kept their Hunsrückisch dialect known as \"Riograndensisch\", followed by Poles. Their arriving numbers supplanted the previous Iberian population, founding cities like Novo Hamburgo and Garibaldi. German immigrants first arrived in 1824 settling in the Sinos River Valley, where one of the first colonies to take an urbanized figure was Hamburger Berg, future Novo Hamburgo, dismembered from or spun out of São Leopoldo, dubbed the cradle of German culture in Brazil. Its capital, Porto Alegre, has the third largest Jewish population in the nation.\nThe vast majority of Slavs is concentrated in Paraná, mainly Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians, followed by German and Italian dwellers in the countryside who also arrived to populate the sparsely inhabited South. Some localities like Mallet, a 19th-century settlement founded by Poles from Austrian Galicia (Eastern Europe) and Ukrainians that grew up to be a town, still maintain both their languages and traditions in a Polish-Ukrainian continuum. After 1909 Dutch settlers became accountable for the dairy farming development in the prairies region of the state, known as \"Campos Gerais do Paraná\", where today are the towns of Castro and Carambeí dubbed Little Holland. The Castro region also received many Lithuanians. The capital, Curitiba, is home to a large figure of Volga Germans that outnumbered the initial and primary Bandeirante descent population during the Imperial period, Faroese people and other Scandinavians, as well as to Slavs, Italians, French, Swiss, Spaniards and one of the country's Jewish communities. Santa Catarina where over 50% of the population has German, Austrian and Luxembourgish ancestry (the local \"Hunsrückisch\" is known as \"Katharinensisch\", East Pomeranian is still spoken in the town of Pomerode and Southern Austro-Bavarian by the Tyrolean population in Treze Tílias) was also the main destination for Danes and the state that was sparsely populated and had its shore mainly inhabited by Azoreans in the 18th century (e.g. Laguna born Anita Garibaldi, wife and comrade-in-arms of Italian Unification revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi), also received Italians, French, Swedes, Norwegians, Swiss, Lithuanians and Latvians, Estonians, Finns, Poles, Slovenians, Croatians, Belgians and Spaniards to populate its interior during the 19th century. The town of Brusque founded by Austrian Baron von Schneeburg bringing German families from the Grand Duchy of Baden to settle in the northeast of Santa Catarina, besides receiving additional waves of Italians from the Tyrol–South Tyrol–Trentino Euroregion, Poles and Swedes, was also one of the destinations in the South and Southeast for American Confederate settlers in 1867, differing from São Paulo and Paraná colonies, where the American Confederate presence gave birth to new towns such as Americana in São Paulo. Neighboring towns such as Nova Trento founded in 1875, similarly received subjects from the Austro-Hungarian Empire due the fact that Italian-speaking Tyroleans known as \"trentinos\" and Germans from the Kingdom of Prussia, historic Swabia and Baden faced an immense crisis in the agricultural sector caused by the conflicts of the unification of Italy and Germany respectively, that weakened local trade. Istrian Italians under the Austrian Empire rule also fled Istria to settle in Brazil, and a few towns like Nova Veneza, founded in 1891 still have an over 90% Venetian population of which many still speak the Talian dialect. Most Venetians settled after the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866, when Venice, along with the rest of the Veneto, became part of the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe Europeanization was so longed that by 1895 the government of São Paulo spent about 15% of its annual budget on subsidies for immigrants.\n\nAfter independence in 1822, about 1.79 million Portuguese immigrants arrived in Brazil, most of them in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Most of these immigrants settled in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nPortuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo. The immigrants opted mostly for urban centers. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the influx of Portuguese immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them. The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans, or Italians who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community). Despite the smaller female proportion, Portuguese men married mainly Portuguese women. Female immigrants rarely married Brazilian men. In this context, the Portuguese had a rate of endogamy which was higher than any other European immigrant community, and behind only the Japanese among all immigrants.\n\nAn additional figure of 1.2 million Portuguese arrived between 1951 and 1975 to settle mostly in the Southeast. \nNowadays, Lusitanians constitute the biggest group of foreigners living in the country, with over 690,000 Portuguese nationals currently living in Brazil. The vast majority arrived in the last decade. The first semester of 2011 solely had an increase of 52 thousand Portuguese nationals applying for a permanent residence visa while another large group was granted Brazilian citizenship.\n\nAbout 1.64 million Italians arrived in Brazil, starting in 1875. First they settled as small land owners in rural communities across Southern Brazil. In the late 19th century, the Brazilian State offered land to immigrants, in conditions that made it possible to buy them. Later, their destination were mostly the coffee plantations in the Southeast, especially the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, where they initially worked for the local landowners, either for a wage or under a contract that allowed them to use a portion of land for subsistency, in exchange for labour in the plantation.\n\nItalians made up the main group of immigrants to Brazil in the late 19th century.\n\nThe vast majority of the Italian settlers came from Veneto and, according to Ethnologue, today around 4 million people still speak the Venetian dialect called Talian or Veneto in Southern Brazil. Veneto was followed mainly by Campania, Lombardy, Calabria, Abruzzi e Molise, Tuscany and Emilia Romagna.\n\nIn São Paulo capital, which came to be labeled an \"Italian city\" in the early twentieth century, Italians engaged mainly in the incipient industry and urban services activities. They came to represent 90% of the 60,000 workers employed in São Paulo factories in 1901.\n\nAbout 720,000 Spaniards came to Brazil, starting in the late 19th century. Most of them were attracted to work in the coffee plantations in the State of São Paulo.\n\nIn all Brazilian states, the immigrants from Galicia predominated, and those were predominantly males, who emigrated alone, settled in urban centers and paid for their passage by ship. The only exception was the state of São Paulo, destination for the vast majority of the Spaniards, between 66% and 75% of the total. In São Paulo, 55% were from Andaluzia, and only 23% from Galicia. Those had their passage by ship paid by the Brazilian government, emigrated in families and were taken to the coffee farms for the needed manpower. \nGalician smallholders and artisans settled mainly in urban areas of Brazil and eventually became factory workers.\nOne factor that contributed to the more rapid process of assimilation and acculturation of the community of Spanish origin in Brazil was, in addition to linguistic and cultural proximity (accentuated by the high presence of Galicians whose Galician language is closer to Portuguese due the fact that they share or belong to the same linguistic system, differently from Castilian), the ease with which both Spanish men and women married Brazilians, mostly Lusitanian Brazilians: 64.7% of Spanish men married Brazilian women and 47.2% of Spanish women married Brazilian men.\n\nBrazil is home to the second largest German-Austrian population outside their respective nations, after the USA.\nAnd German is the second most spoken language in the country. According to Ethnologue, Standard German is spoken by 1.5 million people and Brazilian German encompass assorted dialects, including Riograndenser Hunsrückisch spoken by over 3 million Brazilians. Today more speakers of the East Pomeranian dialect can be found in Brazil than its original Low German-speaking land, and the dialect is especially spoken in Pomerode, Santa Catarina as well as in the states of Espírito Santo and Rio Grande do Sul where it enjoys co-official status. Other dialects include Luxembourgish (part of the Moselle Franconian dialects group together with \"Hunsrik\"), Swiss Alemannic, Low Saxon–rooted Plautdietsch, spoken by ethnic German Mennonites from the former Soviet Union (since the 1930s), Southern Austro-Bavarian, Tyrol dialect and Vorarlberg High Alemannic German, especially in Dreizehnlinden, Santa Catarina (since 1933), and Danube Swabian in Guarapuava, Paraná (since 1951).\n\nThe author Stefan Zweig who wrote about Brazil, and the Habsburg-Lorraine Maria Leopoldina of Austria, Empress consort of Brazil, are among the most prominent Austrians to settle in Brazil.\n\nAbout 260,000 Germans settled in Brazil. They were the fourth largest nationality to immigrate to Brazil, after the Portuguese (1.8 million), the Italians (1.6 million), the Spaniards (0.72 million); Germans were followed by the Japanese (248,000), the Poles and the Russians.\n\nThe vast majority settled in states of São Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, and Rio de Janeiro. Less than 5% of Germans settled in Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, and Espírito Santo.\n\nThe most influenced state by the German immigration was Santa Catarina, where Germans and Austrians were about 50% of all foreigners (Germans, 40%; Austrians, 10%), it was the only state where Germans were the principal nationality among foreigners. Other states with some significant proportion were Rio Grande do Sul (Germans, slightly over 25%) and Paraná (Germans, 10%; Austrians, 10%).\nThe Oktoberfest of Blumenau in Santa Catarina is Brazil's largest and the world's second largest (after Germany's main beer festival in Munich).\n\nEndogamy was the rule among the 19th-century German, Austrian and Luxembourgish colonies and young married women in the homogeneously isolated German colonies settled in the three Southern states had a high fertility rate of 8-9 children per woman; that was especially the case for those youths married between 20 and 24 years old.\n\nIn Rio Grande do Sul, the House of Representatives recognized Hunsrückisch as an official Intangible cultural heritage of historical value to be preserved.\n\nPoles came in significant numbers to Brazil after 1870. Most of them settled in the State of Paraná, working as small farmers. From 1872 to 1919, 110,243 \"Russian\" citizens entered Brazil. In fact, the vast majority of them were Poles (\"Russian\" Catholics), since, up to 1917, a part of Poland was under Russian rule due to the Partitions of Poland and ethnic Poles immigrated with Russian passports.\n\nPolish can still be heard in small towns such as Mallet, Paraná, where the vast majority of the population descends from Western and Northern Slavic settlers who arrived in Brazil in the 1890s (mostly Poles who came from Galicia which was under Austrian rule then).\n\nThe city of Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world (after Chicago) and Polish music, dishes and culture are quite common in the region. Curitiba was largely influenced by the Polish descent mayor Jaime Lerner, originally an architect and urban planner.\n\nIn 1818, King John VI of Portugal and Brazil, then resident in Rio de Janeiro, authorized the entry into Brazil of Swiss immigrants from the canton of Fribourg (Switzerland). The parish founded in 1819 was given the name of \"São João Batista de Nova Friburgo\" (Saint John the Baptist of New Fribourg), .\n\nAn estimated 80,000 Brazilians are of Luxembourgian descent due to a small immigration of Luxembourgers to Brazil, mostly during the late 19th an early 20th centuries.\n\nMore than 20,000 Ukrainians came to Brazil between 1895 and 1897, settling mostly in the countryside of Paraná and working as farmers in the state, today a land of regnant Orthodox churches, where Slavic traditions can be witnessed all over the territory\n\nDutch people first settled in Brazil during the 17th century, with the state of Pernambuco being a colony of the Dutch Republic from 1630 to 1661. During the 19th and 20th century, immigrants from the Netherlands populated the central and southern states of Brazil.\nThe first Dutch immigrants to South America after its independence waves from their metropoles went to the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo between 1858 and 1862, where they founded the settlement of Holanda, a colony of 500 mainly Reformed folk from West Zeeuws-Vlaanderen in the Dutch province of Zeeland.\nDutch and other Low Franconian languages are still spoken in São Paulo (state), especially Holambra (named after Holland-America-Brazil), famous for its tulips and the annual Expoflora event, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and around Ponta Grossa, Castrolanda and Carambeí known as little Holland, in the plains of Paraná, headquarters of several food companies and a dairy farming region.\n\nMost Belgian settlements took place in Southern and Southeastern Brazil. Among the Flemish colonies are Itajaí (Santa Catarina - 1845), Porto Feliz (São Paulo - 1888), \nTaubaté (São Paulo – 1889), and Botucatu (São Paulo - 1960). Many Belgians also preferred to establish their lives in urban centers such as Rio de Janeiro capital.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1965 around 100,000 French people immigrated to Brazil. The country received the second largest number of French immigrants to South America after Argentina (239,000). It is estimated that there are 1.2 million Brazilians of French and Walloon descent today.\n\nBrazil is home to the largest Scandinavian population (Germanic Nordic countries) in Latin America, with a majority of Norwegian descendants.\n\nThe relations between Brazil and Sweden are rooted in the family ties of the Brazilian and the Swedish Royal Families and in the Swedish emigration to Brazil in the end of the 19th century. The wife of King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway, Queen Joséphine of Leuchtenberg, was sister to Amélie of Leuchtenberg, wife of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil. Diplomatic relations between Brazil and Sweden were established in 1826. During the mid to late 19th century many Scandinavians arrived in Brazil, particularly to the southern states as well as Rio de Janeiro, which features a Scandinavian Association, and São Paulo, where the Scandinavian church is based.\n\nBrazil was among the main destinations for Russian refugees during the 20th century.\nFernando Lázaro de Barros Basto in \"Síntese da história da imigração no Brasil\"(1970) gives a total number of 319,215 immigrants from \"Russia\" (i.e. the Russian Empire pre-1917 and the Soviet Union post-1917) for the period of 1871 to 1968.\n\nBrazil is home to the largest Baltic diaspora outside their original land, especially Lithuanian descendants. Their migration peaked in 1920s and 1930s, when 35% of all emigrants from interwar Lithuania chosen Brazil as their destination, around 50 000 moved in. Besides Lithuanians, the Baltic diaspora also comprises one of the largest Latvian populations.\n\nThe first Lithuanians to set foot on Brazil in the 19th century had as their destination the newly established colony of Ijuí, situated on the red and fertile soil of the northwestern part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, while most Lithuanians and Latvians would settle in São Paulo posteriorly. Besides São Paulo, other states that received Baltic people during the 20th century were Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina and Espírito Santo. Latvian is still spoken in Santa Catarina and Paraná.\n\nToday, the state of São Paulo is home to the majority of the Lithuanian Brazilians, and its capital hosts the only true Lithuanian neighborhood in South America - Vila Zelina. Its construction was carried out ~1927 when Lithuanian immigration was peaking. The district is centered around Republic of Lithuania Plaza (\"Praça República Lituânia\"), where 7 streets meet up (one of them named after a Lithuanian priest Pijus Ragažinskas (Pio Ragazinskas, 1907-1988) who started the only Lithuanian-Brazilian newspaper \"Mūsų Lietuva\"). Liberty statue (1977) that crowns the Plaza center is modelled after the one in Kaunas, Lithuania (that original symbol of interwar Lithuanian freedom had been pulled down by Soviets in 1950, making its reconstruction in communism-free São Paulo even more symbolic). It bears the inscription \"Lietuviais esame gimę, lietuviais turime būt\" (\"Lithuanians we are born, Lithuanians we must be\") - lyrics of a traditional patriotic song. They are joined by Columns of Gediminas, a symbol of the famous Gediminid dynasty (1315-1572) which brought the medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania to its glory as the Europe's largest state. There's also a Lithuanian church facing the square.\n\nBrazil is home to a large population of European peoples who speak Uralic languages. Mostly Hungarians and Finns, followed by an Estonian minority of Finnic language, who also composes the Baltic Finns group.\n\nMost Hungarian descendants live in São Paulo, where there are several Hungarian associations. Hungarians have two institutions with legal personality: the Brazilian-Hungarian Aid Association and the Brazilian-Hungarian Cultural Association; and both own the auditorium Hungarian House. The Kálmán Könyves Free University is another organization to form the additional group.\n\nPenedo, a small town located near Itatiaia National Park, was the first Finnish colony to be established in Brazil. Finnish architecture, cuisine and traditional customs such as saunas, are still present and able to be witnessed.\n\nThe Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was signed between King Edward III of England and King Ferdinand and Queen Eleanor of Portugal. It established a treaty of \"perpetual friendships, unions [and] alliances\" between the two seafaring nations. It is the oldest active treaty in the world. The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is visible when on 23 June 1661 the marriage treaty between King Charles II and Catherine of Bragança was duly signed. In return for Bombay, Tangier, free trade with Brazil and the East Indies acquired as the princess' dowry, England offered military assistance to help protect Portugal from Spain. Other noticeable occasions were during the Napoleonic Wars when the Portuguese royal family moved to Brazil with the help of the English fleet and the Portuguese assistance to England during the First War.\n\nBritish immigration to Brazil can be divided into four main periods: colonial, monarchical, Old Republic and the 1960s/1970s. Most of the oldest capitals in Brazil possess colonial Anglican cemeteries or English cemeteries. And a group of Scottish religious dissidents established a colony in the northeast of Brazil during the colonial period. After Brazil was promoted to kingdom, the 19th century witnessed a new wave of British citizens settling in the country, since England had special trading privileges with the nation. English were responsible for most of the railways, public lighting and urban transportation like trams and Irish worked as manual workers in constructions such as the Madeira-Mamoré Railway in the rainforest. There were also English nationals in the financial system.\nThe Anglo-Scots-Brazilian Charles William Miller is celebrated for making football popular in Brazil and deemed as the father of Brazilian football. Oscar Cox and his sibling Edwin, both children of an English diplomat, are also praised for pioneering football in Brazil and introducing the sport especially to the city of Rio de Janeiro during the 1900s. Oscar organized the first football match in the history of the state of Rio de Janeiro in 1901 and then proceeded to São Paulo, with his select team, to play against the squad led by Charles Miller, who had started the process of disseminating football in São Paulo back in 1894. Even though the sport had been played in an informal manner since the 1870s by British, Dutch and French sailors, as well as by European immigrants, Miller's merit lays in the fact that he arrived in Brazil with the necessary apparatus for the organized practice of football, being the first team manager, and consolidating it within sports clubs by captivating the public, considering that the then British-Brazilians and other citizens of the period were more accustomed to cricket. Bertha Lutz was a Brazilian zoologist, politician, and diplomat born in 1894. Lutz, whose mother was a British nurse and father a Swiss-Brazilian pioneering physician and epidemiologist, became a leading figure in both the Pan American feminist movement fighting for women's suffrage and human rights movement.\nThe 1960s and 1970s also saw new waves of English, Welsh and Scottish nationals, especially youths, immigrating to Brazil.\n\nAt the end of the American Civil War in the 1860s, a migration of Confederates to Brazil began, with the total number of immigrants estimated in the thousands. They settled primarily in Southern and Southeastern Brazil founding many towns in the state of São Paulo: Americana, Campinas, Santa Bárbara d'Oeste, Juquiá, New Texas, Eldorado (former Xiririca) as well as moving to the capital São Paulo. The bordering state of Paraná was the main destination in the South, followed by Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, where Americans arrived in 1867 settling in growing towns such as Brusque. The city of Rio de Janeiro, the town of Rio Doce in Minas Gerais and the state of Espírito Santo were other destinations in the Southeast region. Later waves settled in Santarém, Pará—in the north of the Amazon River—as well as in the states of Bahia and Pernambuco, adding a significant number of immigrants to the region's population. Altogether, close to 25,000 American immigrants settled in Brazil during the 19th century.\nThat is one of the main reasons why emperor Dom Pedro II was the first foreign Chief of State and Head of Government to visit Washington, D.C. in 1876 and also attended the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.\nThe first Confederado recorded was Colonel William H. Norris, a former senator of Alabama who left the U.S. with 30 Confederate families and arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 27 December 1865.\nThe colony at Santa Bárbara D'Oeste is sometimes called the \"Norris Colony\". The New Texas colony's leader, Frank McMullen, also left the U.S. in 1865 with former citizens of the Confederacy. Ethnically the Confederados cultural sub-group, the way how the Confederate colonies were named, were primally Scottish, English-Welsh, Irish, Scandinavian, Dutch and German, (ethnic Germans among Romanian, Czech, Russian and Polish immigrant descendants). More recently, other waves of American nationals became residents in the country.\n\nPérola Ellis Byington (Pearl) born in 1879 to the American immigrants Mary Elisabeth Ellis and Robert Dickson McIntyre in Santa Bárbara D'Oeste and married to the industrialist Alberto Jackson Byington, was an accoladed educator, social activist, philanthropist and volunteer for the American and Brazilian Red Cross, who had hospitals and a town in Paraná named after her. Other famous Brazilians who descend from American immigrants are the former Chief Justice of Brazil Ellen Gracie Northfleet, first woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court; Warwick Estevam Kerr, a geneticist, agricultural engineer, entomologist, professor and scientific leader, notable for his discoveries in the genetics and sex determination of bees; and the singer Rita Lee Jones, dubbed \"the mother of Brazilian rock'n'roll\".\n\nBrazil has the largest Lebanese and Syrian population outside the Levant region, Christians in the great majority.\nThere were many causes for Arabs to leave their homelands in the Ottoman Empire; overpopulation in Lebanon, conscription in Lebanon and Syria, and religious persecution by the Ottoman Turks.\n \nBrazil is also home to one of the top 10 largest Jewish diasporas on Earth, most of them of Ashkenazi background but also Sephardi Jews included. Brazil figures on the diasporas list together with Argentina, and São Paulo has one of the largest Jewish populations by urban area on the planet. Ashkenazi Jews first arrived during Imperial times, when the liberal second emperor of Brazil welcomed a few thousands of families facing persecution in Europe during the 1870s and 1880s. Two heavier influxes took place during the 20th century. The earliest right after the Great War and the second inrush between the 1930s and 1950s.\nAnusim or Portuguese and Dutch Marrano Crypto Jews can be found in every one of the 5 geographical regions, but are most common in the Northeast, with Pernambuco having one of the largest Converso populations due to colonial history. Brazil has the oldest synagogue in the Americas founded during Dutch Brazil rule, Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue, located in Recife. Erected in 1636, its foundations have been recently rediscovered, and the 20th-century buildings on the site have been altered to resemble a 17th-century Dutch synagogue. There is now a museum on the site praising it as one of the oldest synagogues in the world. After the Dutch defeat, part of those Jews moved to North America, settling in New Amsterdam, Dutch colony that would become today's New York. They founded in New Amsterdam the oldest Jewish congregation in the USA, the Congregation Shearith Israel.\nThe capital of São Paulo together with the satellite city of Campinas in the metropolitan area has the greatest number of Jews in the country, followed by Rio de Janeiro capital and Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. Other state capitals in the nation that figure among the largest Jewish communities are Curitiba in Paraná, Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, Recife, the national capital Brasília in the Federal District, Belém, Manaus and Florianópolis.\nIn August 2004, the mayor of São Paulo, a metropolis home to 77,000 Jews, declared her city a sister city with Tel Aviv. Mayor Marta Smith Suplicy said the new status would strengthen ties between both Brazilians and Israelis. Suplicy, who had recently married a Jew, added that the new status would be a kickoff for urban, cultural, scientific, tourist and economic programs.\nThe Anti-Defamation League and other Israeli/Jewish papers and surveys placed Brazil among the least anti-semitic nations in the Americas and Western Hemisphere (i.e., Western Europe and Western world), which subsequently means among the least anti-semitic ones on the planet. And Jewish Brazilian personalities stated in a jocose form that the only threat they face is assimilation by marriage with Christians or non-religious descendants of Christian Europeans, Levantine Arabs and East Asians. Intermarriage between Jews and Christian European descendants might have an even higher rate than in the US.\n\nGreek immigration to Brazil can be divided into three periods. The first Greek families arrived during the monarchical period in the 19th century, followed by two larger influxes: the period right after the break of the Great War in 1914 and prolonged until the 1930s, and the final one right after WW2, with most Greeks settling in São Paulo.\n\nWhites constitute the majority of Brazil's population regarding the total numbers within a single racial group. The country has the second largest white population in the Americas in absolute numbers and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. The white-Brazilian population constitute the third largest white population in the world within a nation in absolute numbers, after the United States and Russia.\n\nWhites are the most successful ethnic group in Brazilian society. Whites dominate Brazilian arts, business and science. Overall, whites constitute 86.3% of the group among the 1% richest population of Brazil . They majority of among the representatives of the 20 largest companies in Brazil are white. These companies include likes of Petrobrás, Oi telecommunications, Ambev and Gerdau and Braskem groups, and according to the Valor 1000 ranking from 2014, 95% of these representatives declare themselves as white, 5% declare themselves as pardos and none declared for blacks or Asians. The most successful Brazilian entrepreneurs have historically been white. Jorge Paulo Lemann, an investor and the child of Swiss immigrants, is ranked as the 19th richest person in the world by Forbes, with an estimated net worth of US$38.7 billion. Eduardo Saverin is the Co-founder of Facebook, one of the world's wealthiest companies, and most powerful social media platforms, was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nWhites dominate Brazilian fashion. Gisele Bundchen has been the highest paid model in the world for 10 years. With a reported net worth of $290 million, she is widely recognized as the poster child for Brazilian fashion models, being the first ‘breakthrough’ model from Brazil. Alessandra Ambrosio is most famous for being a Victoria's Secret and ‘PINK’ model. Earning an estimated $6.6 million per annum. Alexandre Herchcovitch is a well-known fashion designer in the Paris, London, New York and Tokyo circuits.\n\nXuxa Meneghel, a television presenter, film actress, singer and successful businesswoman born in Rio Grande do Sul, has the highest net worth of any Brazilian female entertainer, estimated at US$350 million.<ref name=\"http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt\"></ref>\n\nWhites also dominate the sciences and academics. According to a Folha University Ranking, among the rectors and vice-chancellors of the 25 top universities, 89.8% are white; 8.2% are pardos and 2% are black and none as Asian.\n\nIn the world of Brazilian sports, some of the most successful Brazilian athletes have been white. Ayrton Senna was among the most dominant and successful Formula One drivers of the modern era and is considered by many as the greatest racing driver of all time. Robert Scheidt is one of the most successful sailors at Olympic Games and one of the most successful Brazilian Olympic athletes. Zico, the world's best football player of the late 1970s and early 80s. Others include, Gustavo Kuerten, the only Brazilians tennis player to be ranked nr 1, César Cielo the most successful Brazilian swimmer in history, having obtained three Olympic medals. Oscar Schmidt, who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013. The Brazil men's national volleyball team is the most successful volleyball team in the world and is mostly white (Gustavo Endres, Giba, André Heller, Murilo Endres), and many others.\n\nAmong women Maria Esther Bueno is the most successful Brazilian tennis player at the Grand Slam tournaments. She won seven single titles (four wins at the US Open and three at Wimbledon) and twelve doubles titles (five at Wimbledon, four at the US Open, two in the Roland Garros, including a mixed doubles, and once at the Australian Open).\n\nThe Brazilian states with the highest percentages of whites are the three located in the South of the country: Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná. These states, along with São Paulo, received an important influx of European immigrants in the period of the Great Immigration (1876–1914).\n\n\nThe Brazilian states with the lowest percentages of whites are located in the North, where there is a strong Amerindian influence in the population's racial composition, and in part of the Northeast, notably in Bahia and Maranhão, where African influence is stronger.\n\n\nStates with high absolute numbers:\n\n\nThe nation's capital, Brasília, in the Federal District has 1,084,418 white citizens.\n\n\nIn a list of the 144 Brazilian towns with the highest percentages of whites, all the cities were located in two states: Rio Grande do Sul or Santa Catarina. All these towns are settled predominantly by Brazilians of German and Italian descent and are very small. It is important to note that in the late 19th century, many German and Italian immigrants created small communities across Southern Brazil. These communities were settled, in many cases, exclusivily by European immigrants and their descendants.\nThe Brazilian towns with the largest percentages of whites are the following:\n\n\nThe Brazilian towns with the lowest percentages of whites are located in Northern and Northeastern Brazil and are also small.\n\n\nThe genes can reveal from what part of the world the oldest ancestors of the paternal and maternal line of a person came from. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in all human beings and passed down through the maternal line, i.e. the mother of a mother of a mother etc. The Y chromosome is present only in males and passed down through the paternal line, i.e., the father of a father of a father etc. The mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome suffer only minor mutations through centuries, thus can be used to establish the paternal line in males (because only males have the Y chromosome) and the maternal line in both males and females.\n\nAccording to a genetic study about Brazilians (based upon about 200 samples), on the paternal side, 98% of the white Brazilian Y Chromosome comes from a European male ancestor, only 2% from an African ancestor and there is a complete absence of Amerindian contributions. On the maternal side, 39% have European Mitochondrial DNA, 33% Amerindian and 28% African female ancestry. This, considering the facts that the slave trade was effectively suppressed in 1850, and that the Amerindian population had been reduced to small numbers even earlier, shows that at least 61% of white Brazilians had at least one ancestor living in Brazil before the beginning of the Great Immigration. This analysis, however, only shows a small fraction of a person's ancestry (the Y Chromosome comes from a single male ancestor and the mtDNA from a single female ancestor, while the contributions of the many other ancestors is not specified).\n\nAccording to another genetic research (based upon about 200 samples again) over 75% of caucasians from North, Northeast and Southeast Brazil would have over 10% Sub-Saharan African genes, and that this would also be the case with Southern Brazil for 49% of the caucasian population. According to this study, in all United States 11% of Caucasians have over 10% African genes. Thus, 86% of Brazilians would have at least 10% of genes that came from Africa. The researchers however were cautious about its conclusions: \"Obviously these estimates were made by extrapolation of experimental results with relatively small samples and, therefore, their confidence limits are very ample\". A new autosomal study from 2011, also led by Sérgio Pena, but with nearly 1000 samples this time, from all over the country, shows that in most Brazilian regions most Brazilians \"whites\" are less than 10% African in ancestry, and it also shows that the \"pardos\" are predominantly European in ancestry, the European ancestry being therefore the main component in the Brazilian population, in spite of a very high degree of African ancestry and significant Native American contribution. Other autosomal studies (see some of them below) show a European predominance in the Brazilian population.\n\nAnother genetic research suggested that the white Brazilian population is not genetically homogenous, as its genomic ancestry varies in different regions. Samples of white males from Rio Grande do Sul have showed significant differences between whites of different localities of state. In a sample from the town of Veranópolis, heavily settled by people of Italian descent, the results from the maternal and paternal sides showed almost complete European ancestry. On the other hand, a sample of whites from several other regions of Rio Grande do Sul showed significant fractions of Native American (36%) and African (16%) mtDNA haplogroups.\n\nAnother study (based on blood polymorphisms, from 1981) carried out in one thousand individuals from Porto Alegre city, Southern Brazil, and 760 from Natal city, Northeastern Brazil, found whites of Porto Alegre had 8% of African alleles and in Natal the ancestry of the samples total was characterized as 58% white, 25% black, and 17% Amerindian. This study found that persons identified as white or Pardo in Natal have similar ancestries, a dominant European ancestry, while persons identified as white in Porto Alegre have an overwhelming majority of European ancestry.\n\nAccording to an autosomal DNA genetic study from 2011, both \"whites\" and \"pardos\" from Fortaleza have a predominantly degree of European ancestry (>70%), with minor but important African and Native American contributions. \"Whites\" and \"pardos\" from Belém and Ilhéus also were found to be pred. European in ancestry, with minor Native American and African contributions.\n\nAccording to another study, autosomal DNA study (see table), those who identified as whites in Rio de Janeiro turned out to have 86.4% and self identified pardos 68.1% European ancestry on average. Blacks were found out to have on average 41.8% European ancestry.\n\nAccording to another study (from 1965, and based on blood groups and electrophoretic markers) carried out on whites of Northeastern Brazilian origin living in São Paulo the ancestries would be 70% European, 18% African and 12% Amerindian admixture.\n\nAnother study (autosomal DNA study, from 2010) found out that European ancestry predominates in the Brazilian population as a whole (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\" altogether). European ancestry is dominant throughout Brazil at nearly 80%, except for the Southern part of Brazil, where the European heritage reaches 90%. \"A new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine 'American Journal of Human Biology' by a team of the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin colour, colour of the eyes and colour of the hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies\"(regardless of census classification). \"Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F (st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions.\" Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.\" It is important to note that \"the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers, thus as the researchers made it explicit: \"the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of variable socioeconomic strata, although \"likely to be leaning slightly\ntowards the ‘‘pardo’’ group\"\". According to it the total European, African and Native American contributions to the Brazilian population are:\n\nIn support of the dominant European heritage of Brazil, according to another autosomal DNA study (from 2009) conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the \"pardos\" there were found to be on average over 80% European, and the \"whites\" (who thought of themselves as \"very mixed\") were found out to carry very little Amerindian or African admixtures. \"The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry\", say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The \"pardos\" for example thought of themselves as ⅓ European, ⅓ African and ⅓ Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry was determined to be at over 80% European. The \"blacks\" (pretos) of the periphery of Rio de Janeiro, according to this study, thought of themselves as predominantly African before the study and yet they turned out \"predominantly European\" (\"at 52%\"), the African contribution at 41% and the Native American 7%.\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a pred. degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.\n\nAccording to another autosomal DNA study from 2009, the Brazilian population, in all regions of the country, was also found out to be predominantly European: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\". According to it the total European, African and Native American contributions to the Brazilian population are:\n\nAccording to another autosomal study from 2008, by the University of Brasília (UnB), European ancestry dominates in the whole of Brazil (in all regions), accounting for 65,90% of heritage of the population, followed by the African contribution (24,80%) and the Native American (9,3%).\n\nAn autosomal study from 2011 (with nearly almost 1000 samples from all over the country, \"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\" included, according to their respective proportions) has also concluded that European ancestry is the predominant ancestry in Brazil, accounting for nearly 70% of the ancestry of the population: \"In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South\". The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil), and also public health institutions personnel and health students. In all Brazilian regions European, African and Amerindian genetic markers are found in the local populations, even though the proportion of each varies from region to region and from individual to individual. However most regions showed basically the same structure, a greater European contribution to the population, followed by African and Native American contributions: \"Some people had the vision Brazil was a heterogeneous mosaic [...] Our study proves Brazil is a lot more integrated than some expected\". Brazilian homogeneity is, therefore, greater within regions than between them:\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).\n\nAccording to an autosomal DNA study (from 2003) focused on the composition of the Brazilian population as a whole, \"European contribution [...] is highest in the South (81% to 82%), and lowest in the North (68% to 71%). The African component is lowest in the South (11%), while the highest values are found in the Southeast (18–20%). Extreme values for the Amerindian fraction were found in the South and Southeast (7%-8%) and North (17%-18%)\". The researchers were cautious with the results as their samples came from paternity test takers which may have skewed the results partly.\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American. A more recent study, from 2013, found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61,9% European, 25,5% African and 11,6% Native American.\n\nSeveral other older studies have suggested that European ancestry is the main component in all Brazilian regions. A study from 1965, Methods of Analysis of a Hybrid Population (Human Biology, vol 37, number 1), led by the geneticists D. F. Roberts e R. W. Hiorns, found out the average the Northeastern Brazilian to be predominantly European in ancestry (65%), with minor but important African and Native American contributions (25% and 9%). A study from 2002 quoted previous and older studies, saying that: \"Salzano (28, a study from 1997) calculated for the Northeastern population as a whole, 51% European, 36% African, and 13% Amerindian ancestries whereas in the north, Santos and Guerreiro (29, a study from 1995) obtained 47% European, 12% African, and 41% Amerindian descent, and in the southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, Dornelles et al. (30, a study from 1999) calculated 82% European, 7% African, and 11% Amerindian ancestries. Krieger et al. (31, \"a study from 1965\") studied a population of Brazilian northeastern origin living in São Paulo with blood groups and electrophoretic markers and showed that whites presented 18% of African and 12% of Amerindian genetic contribution and that blacks presented 28% of European and 5% of Amerindian genetic contribution (31). Of course, all of these Amerindian admixture estimates are subject to the caveat mentioned in the previous paragraph. At any rate, compared with these previous studies, our estimates showed higher levels of bidirectional admixture between Africans and non-Africans.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "16084391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16084391", "title": "Women in Cyprus", "text": "Women in Cyprus\n\nCypriot women were greatly affected by changes in the wake of World War II, as they received expanded access to education and increased participation in the national workforce. Cyprus women have made great advancements in their society not just pertaining to education and the workplace, but also more women are beginning to hold political offices as well.\n\nAccording to World Population Review, in 2014, the population in Cyprus was 1,153,058. Women make up 48.944% of the total population in Cyprus.\n\nEven at the beginning of the 1990s, Cypriot women were still burdened with the expectation of safeguarding the honor of the family. According to tradition, a woman's duty was to protect herself against all criticism of sexual immodesty.\n\nA study carried out in a farming community in the mid-1970s found that women were still expected to avoid any social contact with men that could be construed to have a sexual context. An expressed desire to participate in male society was seen to reflect poorly on a woman's honor, and virginity was seen by many villagers, both men and women, to be a precondition for marriage. The honor of a family, that is, the sense of dignity of its male members, depended on the sexual modesty and virtue of its women. These traditional attitudes have waned somewhat in recent decades, especially in urban areas, but were still prevalent in the early 1990s. Another indication of the conservative nature of Greek Cypriot society at the beginning of the 1990s was that the feminist movement in Cyprus was often the object of ridicule from both sexes. Nevertheless, women's increasing economic independence was a force for liberation in all sections of the population.\nWomen in Cyprus roles have changes and altered over the years. In the past, Cyprus women's main expectations were to get married and have children. Their schooling was little to none and many women did not work outside their homes. If you ask a women in Cyprus if her social role is different than that of men, many of them will disagree. Today, many Cyprus women have jobs outside of their homes and receive a higher education. Even so, women still continue to keep up with the domestic work that their home life requires of them. Something that hasn't changed in Cyprus is the idea that women should be seen not heard or listen rather than speak. Due to gender socialization, women in Cyprus are known to keep their goals and successes to themselves.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the proportion of girls to boys enrolled in primary education was one to three. By 1943, some 80 percent of Cypriot girls attended primary school. When, in 1960, elementary education was made compulsory, the two sexes were equally enrolled. By the 1980s, girls made up 45 percent of those receiving secondary education. Only after the mid-1960s did women commonly leave Cyprus to receive higher education. In the 1980s, women made up about 32 percent of those studying abroad.\n\nThe participation of Cyriot women in the workforce has been steadily increasing. In 1976 women's share in the workforce was 30 percent and a rise to 37 percent in 1985. Today women's share in the workforce is 44 percent. 62.1% of women between the ages of 15–64 years old are active in workforce.\n\nCyprus has long had a high degree of female participation in the workforce. There were great changes in the nature of female employment. Women's share of the urban workforce rose from 22 percent to 41 percent, while their share of the rural workforce fell from 51 percent to 44.4 percent. The decline in rural areas stemmed from the overall shift away \nfrom agricultural work, where women's contribution had always been vital, to employment in urban occupations such as manufacturing and services.\n\nThe occupational segregation of the sexes was still persistent in Cyprus at the beginning of the 1990s. Even though the participation of women in clerical jobs had more than doubled since the late 1970s, only one woman in fifteen was in an administrative or managerial position in 1985. Women's share of professional jobs increased to 39 percent by the mid-1980s, compared with 36 percent ten years earlier, but these jobs were concentrated in medicine and teaching, where women had traditionally found employment. In fields where men were dominant, women's share of professional positions amounted to only 11 percent, up from 8 percent in 1976. In the fields where women were dominant, men took just under half the professional positions.\n\nNonetheless, there is still room for improvement pertaining to the gender equality Cyprus women are experiencing in the workforce. Not only do Women represent 14.4% of high posts, women are also paid on average 24% less per hour compared to their male counterparts. The equal pay-equal work principal would help to solve this problem, but the women are generally in lower positions then men resulting in the unequal pay.\n\nAccording to the 2006 Population Census, the unemployment rate for women was 19%, whereas for men it was 6%. In 2010, the unemployment rate was 17.5% for women a and 8.9% for men. Even though the unemployment rate for women is decreasing, the rate is still twice as high compared to men.\n\nCypriot women enjoy the same rights to social welfare as men in such matters as social security payments, unemployment compensation, vacation time, and other common social provisions. In addition, after 1985 women benefited from special protective legislation that provided them with marriage and maternity grants that paid them 75 percent of their insurable earnings. Still, a large number of women, including the self-employed and unpaid family workers on farms, were not covered by the Social Insurance Scheme. These women constituted 28 percent of the economically active female population.\n\nIn 1985, the Republic of Cyprus ratified the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. Despite ratification of this agreement, as of late 1990 there was no legislation in the Republic of Cyprus that guaranteed the right to equal pay for work of equal value, nor the right of women to the same employment opportunities.\n\nWomen are present in very few political positions in Cyprus, but the following are some of the women who have held or currently hold a political position:\n\n\nStudies show that socioeconomic patterns play a big role in violence against women in Cyprus, specifically domestic violence. Women who possess characteristics such as having little to no education, reside in Urban areas, are of older age, and struggle financially are said to be prone to domestic violence. Due to there not being a national survey conducted focusing on domestic violence against women in Cyprus, statistics and findings can only be discovered through the police or through Association of the Prevention and Handling of Violence in the Family. The reports to the police have drastically been increasing each year. In 2002, 538 cases were reported, whereas in 2008 that number almost doubled with 969 cases being reported. During the years between 2002-2008, 71.18 percent of the victims were women. During the years between 2004-2009, the number of cases triples and 80 percent of victims are women, whereas 8.6% of victims are men. Of these cases, 79 percent involved physical violence, 18.5 percent involved psychological violence, and 2.4 percent involved sexual violence. The annual report from Association of the Prevention and Handling of Violence in the Family reveals that out of a total of 1051 incidents, 815 of them include women between the ages of 41-50 who were abused. Furthermore. 96.1 percent of these incidents involve psychological violence and 78 percent reside with their attacker.\n\n"}
{"id": "95364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95364", "title": "Xhosa language", "text": "Xhosa language\n\nXhosa () or isiXhosa ( ) is a Nguni Bantu language with click consonants (\"Xhosa\" begins with a click) and is one of the official languages of South Africa.It is also an official language of Zimbabwe. \"Xhosa is spoken as a first language by 8.2 million people and by 11 million as a second language in South Africa, mostly in Eastern Cape Province. Total number of users in all countries is 19.2 million (Ethnologue)\". Like most other Bantu languages, Xhosa is a tonal language; the same sequence of consonants and vowels can have different meanings, depending on intonation. Xhosa has two tones: high and low.\n\nXhosa is written with the Latin alphabet. Three letters are used to indicate the basic clicks: \"c\" for dental clicks, \"x\" for lateral clicks and \"q\" for post-alveolar clicks (for a more detailed explanation, see the table of consonant phonemes below). Tones are not normally indicated in writing.\n\nXhosa is part of the branch of Nguni languages, known as Zunda languages, which also include Zulu, Southern Ndebele and Northern Ndebele. Zunda languages effectively form a dialect continuum of variously mutually intelligible varieties. \n\nXhosa is, to some extent, mutually intelligible with Zulu and Northern Ndebele, and other Nguni languages to a lesser extent. Nguni languages are, in turn, part of the much larger group of Bantu languages.\n\nXhosa is the most widely distributed African language in South Africa, though the most widely spoken African language is Zulu. It is the second most common home language in South Africa as a whole. approximately 5.3 million Xhosa-speakers, the majority, live in the Eastern Cape, followed by the Western Cape (approximately 2 million), Gauteng (671,045), the Free State (246,192), KwaZulu-Natal (219,826), North West (214,461), Mpumalanga (46,553), the Northern Cape (51,228), and Limpopo (14,225). There is a small but significant Xhosa community of about 200,000 in Zimbabwe. Also, a small community of Xhosa speakers (18,000) live in Quthing District, Lesotho.\n\nXhosa has several dialects. Maho (2009) lists Mpondo (Pondo), Xesibe, Bomvana, Gaika (Ngqika), Gcaleka, Thembu, Mpondomise, Ndlambe, and Hlubi.\n\nHlubi is the dialect in the former Ciskei; there is the more distinct Hlubi language further north, where Xhosa meets SeSotho.\n\nXhosa has an inventory of ten vowels: , , , and written as \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\" and \"u\" in order, all occurring in both long and short.\nXhosa is a tonal language with two inherent phonemic tones: low and high. Tones are rarely marked in the written language, but they can be indicated \"a\" [à], \"á\" [á], \"â\" [áà], \"ä\" [àá]. Long vowels are phonemic but are usually not written except for \"â\" and \"ä\", which are the results of gemination of two vowels, both with different tones; they have thus become long vowels with contour tones (\"â\" high-low = falling, \"ä\" low-high = rising).\n\nXhosa is rich in uncommon consonants. Besides pulmonic egressive sounds, which are found in all spoken languages, it has 18 clicks (in comparison, Juǀ'hoan, spoken by roughly 10,000 people in Botswana and Namibia, has 48 clicks, and Taa, with roughly 4,000 speakers in Botswana, has 83 click sounds, the largest consonant inventory of any known language). Also, Xhosa has ejectives and an implosive. Although 15 of the clicks also occur in Zulu, they are used less frequently than in Xhosa.\n\nThe first six are dental clicks (represented by the letter \"c\"), made with the tongue on the back of the teeth, and they are similar to the sound represented in English by \"tut-tut\" or \"tsk-tsk\" to reprimand someone. The next six are lateral (represented by the letter \"x\"), made by the tongue at the sides of the mouth, and they are similar to the sound used to call horses. The last six are alveolar (represented by the letter \"q\"), made with the tip of the tongue at the roof of the mouth, and they sound somewhat like a cork pulled from a bottle.\n\nThe following table lists the consonant phonemes of the language, with the pronunciation in IPA on the left and the orthography on the right:\n\n\nIn addition to the ejective affricate , the spelling \"tsh\" may also be used for either of the aspirated affricates and .\n\nThe breathy voiced glottal fricative is sometimes spelled \"h\".\n\nThe ejectives tend to be elective only in careful pronunciation or in salient positions and, even then, only for some speakers. Otherwise, they tend to be tenuis (plain) stops. Similarly, the tenuis (plain) clicks are often glottalised, with a long voice onset time, but that is uncommon.\n\nThe murmured clicks, plosives and affricates are only partially voiced, with the following vowel murmured for some speakers. That is, \"da\" may be pronounced (or, equivalently, ). They are better described as slack voiced than as breathy voiced. They are truly voiced only after nasals, but the oral occlusion is then very short in stops, and it usually does not occur at all in clicks. Therefore, the absolute duration of voicing is the same as in tenuis stops. (They may also be voiced between vowels in some speaking styles.) The more notable characteristic is their depressor effect on the tone of the syllable.\n\nWhen consonants are prenasalised, their pronunciation and spelling may change. The murmur no longer shifts to the following vowel. Fricatives become affricated and, if voiceless, they become ejectives as well, at least with some speakers: \"mf\" is pronounced , \"ndl\" is pronounced , \"n+hl\" becomes \"ntl\" , \"n+z\" becomes \"ndz\" , \"etc.\" The orthographic \"b\" in \"mb\" is the voiced plosive .\n\nWhen voiceless clicks (\"c, x, q\") are prenasalised, the silent letter \"k\" is added (\"nkc, nkx, nkq\") to prevent confusion with the nasal clicks \"nc, nx, nq\".\n\nIn keeping with many other Southern Bantu languages, Xhosa is an agglutinative language, with an array of prefixes and suffixes that are attached to root words. Like in other Bantu languages, nouns in Xhosa are classified into morphological classes, or genders (15 in Xhosa), with different prefixes for both singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which the word agrees. The word order is subject–verb–object, like in English.\n\nThe verb is modified by affixes to mark subject, object, tense, aspect and mood. The various parts of the sentence must agree in both class and number.\n\nThe Xhosa noun consists of two essential parts, the prefix and the stem. Using the prefixes, nouns can be grouped into noun classes, which are numbered consecutively, to ease comparison with other Bantu languages.\n\nThe following table gives an overview of Xhosa noun classes, arranged according to singular-plural pairs.\n\nVerbs use the following prefixes for the subject and object:\n\nXhosa-speaking people have inhabited coastal regions of southeastern Africa since before the 16th century. They refer to themselves as the \"amaXhosa\" and their language as \"Xhosa\". AmaXhosa migrated to the east coast of Africa and came across Khoisan-speaking people; \"as a result of this contact, the Xhosa people borrowed some Khoisan words along with their pronunciation, for instance, the click sounds of the Khoisan languages\".\n\nThe Bantu ancestor of Xhosa did not have clicks, which attests to a strong historical contact with a San language that did. An estimated 15% of Xhosa vocabulary is of San origin. In the modern period, it has also borrowed, slightly, from both Afrikaans and English.\n\nThe role of indigenous languages in South Africa is complex and ambiguous. Their use in education has been governed by legislation, beginning with the Bantu Education Act, 1953.\n\nAt present, Xhosa is used as the main language of instruction in many primary schools and some secondary schools, but is largely replaced by English after the early primary grades, even in schools mainly serving Xhosa-speaking communities. The language is also studied as a subject.\n\nThe language of instruction at universities in South Africa is English or Afrikaans, and Xhosa is taught as a subject, both for native and for non-native speakers.\n\nLiterary works, including prose and poetry, are available in Xhosa, as are newspapers and magazines. The first printed word in Xhosa came out in 1823 from the Lovedale Press in the Alice region of the Eastern Cape. But, as with any language, Xhosa had a rich history of oral traditions from which the society taught, informed, and entertained one another. The first Bible translation was in 1859, produced in part by Henry Hare Dugmore. The South African Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts in Xhosa on both radio (on Umhlobo Wenene FM) and television, and films, plays and music are also produced in the language. The best-known performer of Xhosa songs outside South Africa was Miriam Makeba, whose \"Click Song #1\" (Xhosa \"Qongqothwane\") and \"Click Song #2\" (\"Baxabene Ooxam\") are known for their large number of click sounds.\n\n, the literacy rate for first-language Xhosa speakers was estimated at 50%.\n\n\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\" is part of the national anthem of South Africa, national anthem of Tanzania and Zambia, and the former anthem of Zimbabwe and Namibia. It is a Methodist hymn written in Xhosa by Enoch Sontonga in 1897. The original stanza was:\n\nAdditional stanzas were written later by Sontonga and other writers, with the original verse translated into Sotho and Afrikaans, as well as English.\n\nIn the Marvel Cinematic Universe films \"\" and \"Black Panther\", the language spoken in the fictional African nation of Wakanda is Xhosa. This came about because South African actor John Kani, a native of the Eastern Cape province who plays Wakandan King T'Chaka, speaks some Xhosa and suggested that the directors of \"Civil War\" incorporate dialogue in the language. For \"Black Panther\", director Ryan Coogler “wanted to make it a priority to use Xhosa as much as possible” in the script, and provided dialect coaches for the film's actors.\n\n\n"}
