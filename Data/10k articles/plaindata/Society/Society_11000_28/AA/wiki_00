Larger projects undertaken within the Initiative Z have eventually found their place into the nationwide state plans of economic development, such as Five-Year Plans.\n\nThe work was done outside the regular work hours, very often on Saturday morning and was somehow similar to \"subbotniks\" in the Soviet Union or standard community-action or community-improvement initiatives and programs in the West.\n\nAlthough it was meant to be entirely voluntary work, the names of volunteers and a number of worked hours were duly documented. Those citizens who did not participate and their names therefore did not figure on the lists, were questioned, why they did not come to contribute and in many cases put under an unpleasant pressure by mentioning possible disadvantages such as a reduced choice with respect to future education or difficult change of employer.\n\nThose citizens who worked the most hours were publicly recognized and there was an award-system which gave those who contributed more than 50 hours in a given year a Silver Akce Z Pin and those with more than 100 hours a Golden Akce Z Pin. Many, especially young people, earned - over the years - several of these and mentioned the fact say in applications for university admission.\n\n\"Z\" stands for the Czech word \"zvelebování\", \"improvement\", referring to improvement of public places. Typical activities ranged from garbage removal and planting trees to construction of some public-service facilities, such as children playgrounds, cultural centers (Kulturní domy, Houses of Culture), municipal pipelines or sewage lines, large number of grocery stores in small villages (for example grocery store Smíšené Zboží in village (Hůrky coordinates 49.049331 N ,15.133108 E) near Nová Bystřice) etc..\n\nIn the late 1980s when the planned economy was in the latest phase of its struggle, even technically advanced projects were attempted to be progressed by sending numbers of unskilled volunteers to help under the umbrella of Initiative Z. However, the lack of skills among volunteers often resulted in contra-productive outcome and faulty results of volunteer work, although well hidden, regularly led to even longer delays. Many participants recalled futile work be ordered upon them, for illustration having to shuffle a large heap of sand with shovels and wheelbarrows the whole day by 20 meters, just to witness it being relocated by a machine to its original location in the following working days.\n\nUnder any regime always sceptical, Czech folk wit claimed that \"Z\" stood for \"zdarma\", i.e., \"without pay\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1530", "title": "Ainu people", "text": "Ainu people\n\nThe Ainu or the Aynu (Ainu アィヌ \"Aynu\"; Japanese: \"Ainu\"; Russian: \"Ajny\"), in the historical Japanese texts the Ezo (), are an indigenous people of Japan (Hokkaido, and formerly northeastern Honshu) and Russia (Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, and formerly the Kamchatka Peninsula).\n\nThe official number of the Ainu is 25,000, but unofficially is estimated at 200,000, due to many Ainu having been completely assimilated into Japanese society and, as a result, having no knowledge of their ancestry.\n\nRecent research suggests that Ainu culture originated from a merger of the Jomon, Okhotsk and Satsumon cultures. In 1264, Ainu invaded the land of Nivkh people controlled by the Yuan Dynasty, resulting in battles between Ainu and the Chinese. Active contact between the Wajin (the ethnically Japanese) and the Ainu of Ezochi (now known as Hokkaido) began in the 13th century. The Ainu formed a society of hunter-gatherers, surviving mainly by hunting and fishing. They followed a religion which was based on natural phenomena.\n\nDuring the Muromachi period (1336–1573), the disputes between the Japanese and Ainu developed into a war. Takeda Nobuhiro killed the Ainu leader, Koshamain. Many Ainu were subject to Japanese rule which led to a violent Ainu revolt such as Koshamain's Revolt () in 1456.\n\nDuring the Edo period (1601–1868) the Ainu, who controlled the northern island which is now named Hokkaido, became increasingly involved in trade with the Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island. The Tokugawa bakufu (feudal government) granted the Matsumae clan exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period the Ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by the Japanese, and were suffering from epidemic diseases such as smallpox.\nAlthough the increased contact created by the trade between the Japanese and the Ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding, it also led to conflict which occasionally intensified into violent Ainu revolts. The most important was Shakushain's Revolt (1669–1672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the Menashi-Kunashir Battle in 1789.\n\nIn the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu. In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaido, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.\n\nThe beginning of the Meiji Restoration in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture. The Japanese government introduced a variety of social, political, and economic reforms in hope of modernizing the country in the Western style. One innovation involved the annexation of Hokkaido. Sjöberg quotes Baba's (1980) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:\n\n… The development of Japan's large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia. Second … it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class … Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy.\n\nIn 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labelling the Ainu as \"former aborigines\", with the idea they would assimilate—this resulted in the Japanese government taking the land where the Ainu people lived and placing it from then on under Japanese control. Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.\nThe Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land—over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese. In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wajin who had decided to move to Hokkaido, encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the island's abundant natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of Western industrial agriculture. While at the time, the process was openly referred to as colonization (\"takushoku\" 拓殖), the notion was later reframed by Japanese elites to the currently common usage \"kaitaku\" (開拓), which instead conveys a sense of opening up or reclamation of the Ainu lands. As well as this, factories such as flour mills, beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904. During this time, the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names, and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.\n\nThe 1899 act mentioned above was replaced in 1997—until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups. It was not until June 6, 2008, that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see Official Recognition, below).\n\nThe vast majority of these Wajin men are believed to have compelled Ainu women into partnering with them as local wives. Intermarriage between Japanese and Ainu was actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture. For example, Oki, born as a child of an Ainu father and a Japanese mother, became a musician who plays the traditional Ainu instrument \"tonkori\". There are also many small towns in the southeastern or Hidaka region where ethnic Ainu live such as in Nibutani (Ainu: \"Niputay\"). Many live in Sambutsu especially, on the eastern coast. In 1966 the number of \"pure\" Ainu was about 300.\n\nTheir most widely known ethnonym is derived from the word \"ainu\", which means \"human\" (particularly as opposed to \"kamui\", divine beings), basically neither ethnicity nor the name of a race, in the Hokkaido dialects of the Ainu language. Ainu is the word Ainu identify themselves as from their first male ancestor Aioina. Ainu also identify themselves as \"Utari\" (”comrade” in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.\n\nOn June 6, 2008, the Japanese Diet passed a bipartisan, non-binding resolution calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as indigenous to Japan, and urging an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognised the Ainu people as \"an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture\". The government immediately followed with a statement acknowledging its recognition, stating, \"The government would like to solemnly accept the historical fact that many Ainu were discriminated against and forced into poverty with the advancement of modernization, despite being legally equal to (Japanese) people.\"\n\nAs a result of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875), the Kuril Islands – along with their Ainu inhabitants – came under Japanese administration. A total of 83 North Kuril Ainu arrived in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on September 18, 1877, after they decided to remain under Russian rule. They refused the offer by Russian officials to move to new reservations in the Commander Islands. Finally a deal was reached in 1881 and the Ainu decided to settle in the village of Yavin. In March 1881, the group left Petropavlovsk and started the journey towards Yavin on foot. Four months later they arrived at their new homes. Another village, Golygino, was founded later. Under Soviet rule, both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the Russian-dominated Zaporozhye rural settlement in Ust-Bolsheretsky Raion. As a result of intermarriage, the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the Kamchadal community. In 1953, K. Omelchenko, the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the USSR, banned the press from publishing any more information on the Ainu living in the USSR. This order was revoked after two decades.\n, the North Kuril Ainu of Zaporozhye form the largest Ainu subgroup in Russia. The Nakamura clan (South Kuril Ainu on their paternal side), the smallest group, numbers just six people residing in Petropavlovsk. On Sakhalin island, a few dozen people identify themselves as Sakhalin Ainu, but many more with partial Ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it. Most of the 888 Japanese people living in Russia (2010 Census) are of mixed Japanese-Ainu ancestry, although they do not acknowledge it (full Japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa-free entry to Japan.) Similarly, no one identifies themselves as Amur Valley Ainu, although people with partial descent live in Khabarovsk. There is no evidence of living descendants of the Kamchatka Ainu.\n\nIn the 2010 Census of Russia, close to 100 people tried to register themselves as ethnic Ainu in the village, but the governing council of Kamchatka Krai rejected their claim and enrolled them as ethnic Kamchadal. In 2011, the leader of the Ainu community in Kamchatka, Alexei Vladimirovich Nakamura, requested that Vladimir Ilyukhin (Governor of Kamchatka) and Boris Nevzorov (Chairman of the State Duma) include the Ainu in the central list of the Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East. This request was also turned down.\n\nEthnic Ainu living in Sakhalin Oblast and Khabarovsk Krai are not organized politically. According to Alexei Nakamura, only 205 Ainu live in Russia (up from just 12 people who self-identified as Ainu in 2008) and they along with the Kurile Kamchadals (Itelmen of Kuril islands) are fighting for official recognition. Since the Ainu are not recognized in the official list of the peoples living in Russia, they are counted as people without nationality or as ethnic Russians or Kamchadal.\n\nThe Ainu have emphasized that they were the natives of the Kuril islands and that the Japanese and Russians were both invaders. In 2004, the small Ainu community living in Russia in Kamchatka Krai wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to reconsider any move to award the Southern Kuril Islands to Japan. In the letter they blamed the Japanese, the Tsarist Russians and the Soviets for crimes against the Ainu such as killings and assimilation, and also urged him to recognize the Japanese genocide against the Ainu people—which was turned down by Putin.\n\nThe Ainu have often been considered to descend from the Jōmon people, who lived in Japan from the Jōmon period ( 14,000 to 300 BCE). One of their \"Yukar Upopo\", or legends, tells that \"[t]he Ainu lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the Children of the Sun came\".\n\nRecent research suggests that the historical Ainu culture originated in a merger of the Okhotsk culture with the Satsumon, one of the ancient archaeological cultures that are considered to have derived from the Jōmon-period cultures of the Japanese archipelago. The Ainu economy was based on farming, as well as on hunting, fishing and gathering.\n\nFull-blooded Ainu, compared to people of Yamato descent, often have lighter skin and more body hair. Many early investigators proposed a Caucasian ancestry, although recent DNA tests have not shown any genetic similarity with modern Europeans. Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza places the Ainu in his \"Northeast and East Asian\" genetic cluster.\n\nAnthropologist Joseph Powell of the University of New Mexico wrote \"...we follow Brace and Hunt (1990) and Turner (1990) in viewing the Ainu as a southeast Asian population derived from early Jomon peoples of Japan, who have their closest biological affinity with south Asians rather than western Eurasia peoples\".\n\nA autosomal DNA research in 2017 resulted in grouping the Ainu and other Jōmon remnants with northeastern Asians.\n\nMark J. Hudson, Professor of Anthropology at Nishikyushu University, Kanzaki, Saga, Japan, has stated that Japan was settled by a \"Proto-Mongoloid\" population in the Pleistocene who became the Jōmon and that their features can be seen in the Ainu and Okinawan people.\n\nIn 1893, anthropologist Arnold Henry Savage Landor described the Ainu as having deep-set eyes and an eye shape typical of Europeans, with a large and prominent browridge, large ears, hairy and prone to baldness, slightly hook nose with large and broad nostrils, prominent cheek-bones and a medium mouth.\n\nOmoto has also shown that the Ainu are far more related to other East Asian groups (previously mentioned as 'Mongoloid') than to any Caucasian groups, on the basis of fingerprints and dental morphology.\n\nA study based on cranial and genetic characteristics suggests an origin of the Ainu in northern Asia.\n\nTurner found remains of Jōmon people of Japan to belong to a pattern resembling the Sundadont pattern which is typically found in Southern Mongoloid living populations of Taiwanese aborigines, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Thais, Borneans, Laotians, and Malaysians. A recreation of a map made by William W. Howells, professor of anthropology at Harvard University, shows in the shaded the remnants and populations of non-Mongoloid people, appearing as N (Negrito) or A (Australoids of Wallacea, Melanesia and Australia). The latter peoples comprise the present aboriginals of Australia and Melanesia, as shown; the interest here is their presence and remnants. Sundadonts comprise Southeast Asiatics and offshore peoples from northern Japan (Ainu) down to Taiwan and Indonesia. Sinodonts comprise the East Asian populations from Korea, Japan, China, Mongolia and Siberia. \n\nAinu men have abundant wavy hair and often have long beards. The book of \"Ainu Life and Legends\" by author Kyōsuke Kindaichi (published by the Japanese Tourist Board in 1942) contains a physical description of Ainu:\nMany have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them.\n\nGenetic testing has shown that the Ainu belong mainly to Y-haplogroup D-M55. Y-DNA haplogroup D1b is found throughout the Japanese Archipelago, but with very high frequencies among the Ainu of Hokkaido in the far north, and to a lesser extent among the Ryukyuans in the Ryukyu Islands of the far south. The only places outside Japan in which Y-haplogroup D is common are Tibet in China and the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean.\nA study by Tajima \"et al.\" (2004) found two out of a sample of sixteen (or 12.5%) Ainu men to belong to Haplogroup C-M217, which is the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among the indigenous populations of Siberia and Mongolia. Hammer \"et al.\" (2006) tested a sample of four Ainu men and found that one of them belonged to haplogroup C-M217. Some researchers have speculated that this minority of Haplogroup C-M217 carriers among the Ainu may reflect a certain degree of unidirectional genetic influence from the Nivkhs, a traditionally nomadic people of northern Sakhalin and the adjacent mainland, with whom the Ainu have long-standing cultural interactions.\n\nBased on analysis of one sample of 51 modern Ainus, their mtDNA lineages consist mainly of haplogroup Y (11/51 = 21.6% according to Tanaka \"et al.\" 2004, or 10/51 = 19.6% according to Adachi \"et al.\" 2009, who have cited Tajima \"et al.\" 2004), haplogroup D (9/51 = 17.6%, particularly D4(xD1)), haplogroup M7a (8/51 = 15.7%), and haplogroup G1 (8/51 = 15.7%). Other mtDNA haplogroups detected in this sample include A (2/51), M7b2 (2/51), N9b (1/51), B4f (1/51), F1b (1/51), and M9a (1/51). Most of the remaining individuals in this sample have been classified definitively only as belonging to macro-haplogroup M. According to Sato \"et al.\" (2009), who have studied the mtDNA of the same sample of modern Ainus (n=51), the major haplogroups of the Ainu are N9 (14/51 = 27.5%, including 10/51 Y and 4/51 N9(xY)), D (12/51 = 23.5%, including 8/51 D(xD5) and 4/51 D5), M7 (10/51 = 19.6%), and G (10/51 = 19.6%, including 8/51 G1 and 2/51 G2); the minor haplogroups are A (2/51), B (1/51), F (1/51), and M(xM7, M8, CZ, D, G) (1/51). Studies published in 2004 and 2007 show the combined frequency of M7a and N9b were observed in Jomons and which are believed by some to be Jomon maternal contribution at 28% in Okinawans (7/50 M7a1, 6/50 M7a(xM7a1), 1/50 N9b), 17.6% in Ainus (8/51 M7a(xM7a1), 1/51 N9b), and from 10% (97/1312 M7a(xM7a1), 1/1312 M7a1, 28/1312 N9b) to 17% (15/100 M7a1, 2/100 M7a(xM7a1)) in mainstream Japanese.\n\nA recent reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than they do the Jōmon. This agrees with the references to the Ainu as a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon referenced above. A recent genetic study has revealed that the closest genetic relatives of the Ainu are the Ryukyuan people, followed by the Yamato people and Nivkh.\n\nToday, it is estimated that fewer than 100 speakers of the language remain, while other research places the number at fewer than 15 speakers. The language has been classified as \"endangered\". As a result of this the study of the Ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research.\n\nAlthough there have been attempts to show that the Ainu language and the Japanese language are related, modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact, such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu. No attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a language isolate.\n\nWords used as prepositions in English (such as \"to\", \"from\", \"by\", \"in\", and \"at\") are postpositional in Ainu; they come after the word that they modify. A single sentence in Ainu can be made up of many added or agglutinated sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas.\n\nThe Ainu language has had no system of writing, and has historically been transliterated by the Japanese kana or Russian Cyrillic. Today, it is typically written in either katakana or Latin alphabet. The unwieldy nature of the Japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent coda consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original Ainu. For example, some words, such as \"Kor\" (meaning \"to hold\"), are now pronounced with a paragoge, as in \"Koro\".\n\nMany of the Ainu dialects, even from one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not mutually intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the Yukar, or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.\n\nTraditional Ainu culture was quite different from Japanese culture. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full beards and moustaches. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women tattooed their mouths, and sometimes the forearms. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour. Their traditional dress was a robe spun from the inner bark of the elm tree, called \"attusi\" or \"attush\". Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.\n\nModern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots were made from the skin of dogs or salmon. Ainu culture considers earrings, traditionally made from grapevines, to be gender neutral. Women also wear a beaded necklace called a tamasay.\n\nTheir traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of bear, fox, wolf, badger, ox, or horse, as well as fish, fowl, millet, vegetables, herbs, and roots. They never ate raw fish or flesh; it was always boiled or roasted.\n\nTheir traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the center. There was no chimney, only a hole at the angle of the roof; there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors. The house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed. Another kind of traditional Ainu house was called \"chise\".\n\nInstead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (\"Iris pseudacorus\"); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; the women had wooden spoons. Ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; there are only a few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaido, serving primarily Japanese fare.\n\nThe functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. Beating was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed.\n\nThe Ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer. The reasons for this were, among others, that in late autumn, plant gathering, salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered.\n\nA village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor). Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory.\n\nThe Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of sika deer), rabbit, fox, raccoon dog, and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu, as were salmon. They also hunted sea eagles such as white-tailed sea eagles, raven and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in trade with the Japanese.\nThe Ainu hunted with arrows and spears with poison-coated points. They obtained the poison, called \"surku\", from the roots and stalks of aconites. The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog's bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo, Matsumomushi, tobacco and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers.\n\nThey hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, for animals like bear in particular, they prayed to the god of fire and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch, and safe hunting to the god of mountains.\n\nThe Ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw. At that time, bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an \"amappo\". The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows. For a large catch, a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death.\n\nMen wore a crown called \"sapanpe\" for important ceremonies. \"Sapanpe\" was made from wood fibre with bundles of partially shaved wood. This crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its centre. Men carried an \"emush\" (ceremonial sword) secured by an \"emush at\" strap to their shoulders.\n\nWomen wore \"matanpushi\", embroidered headbands, and \"ninkari\", earrings. \"Ninkari\" was a metal ring with a ball. Women wore it through a hole in the ear. \"Matanpushi\" and \"ninkari\" were originally worn by men. However, women wear them now. Furthermore, aprons called \"maidari\" now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore \"maidari\". Women sometimes wore a bracelet called \"tekunkani\".\n\nWomen wore a necklace called \"rektunpe\", a long, narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques. They wore a necklace that reached the breast called a \"tamasay\" or \"shitoki\", usually made from glass balls. Some glass balls came from trade with the Asian continent. The Ainu also obtained glass balls secretly made by the Matsumae clan.\n\nA village is called a \"kotan\" in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal clan. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.\n\n\"Cise\" or \"cisey\" (houses) in a kotan were made of cogon grasses, bamboo grass, barks, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the \"rorun-puyar,\" a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called \"shiso\") . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called \"harkiso\"). The house had a platform for valuables called \"iyoykir\" behind the shiso. The Ainu placed \"sintoko\" (hokai) and \"ikayop\" (quivers) there.\n\nOutbuildings included separate lavatories for men called \"ashinru\" and for women called \"menokoru\", a \"pu\" (storehouse) for food, a \"heper set\" (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar (\"nusasan\") faced the east side of the house (\"rorunpuyar\"). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as \"Iyomante\", a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.\n\nThe Ainu people had various types of marriage. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called \"tunpu\" annexed to the southern wall of her house. The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.\n\nThe age of marriage was 17 to 18 years of age for men and 15 to 16 years of age for women, who were tattooed. At these ages, both sexes were regarded as adults.\n\nWhen a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, leggings and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many \"yomeiri\" marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.\n\nFor a \"yomeiri\" marriage, a man and his father would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman, including a sword, a treasured sword, an ornamental quiver, a sword guard, and a woven basket (\"hokai\"). If the man and woman agreed to marry, the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house. At the wedding ceremony, participants prayed to the god of fire. Bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in a bowl, and other participants were entertained.\n\nThe worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as \"attush\", until coming of age.\n\nNewborn babies were named \"ayay\" (a baby's crying), \"shipo\", \"poyshi\" (small excrement), and \"shion\" (old excrement). Children were called by these \"temporary\" names until the ages of two to three. They were not given permanent names when they were born. Their tentative names had a portion meaning \"excrement\" or \"old things\" to ward off the demon of ill-health. Some children were named based on their behaviour or habits. Other children were named after impressive events or after parents' wishes for the future of the children. When children were named, they were never given the same names as others.\n\nMen wore loincloths and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age 15–16. Women were also considered adults at the age of 15–16. They wore underclothes called \"mour\" and had their hair dressed properly and wound waistcloths called \"raunkut\" and \"ponkut\" around their bodies. When women reached age 12–13, the lips, hands and arms were tattooed. When they reached age 15–16, their tattoos were completed. Thus were they qualified for marriage.\n\nThe Ainu are traditionally animists, believing that everything in nature has a \"kamuy\" (spirit or god) on the inside. The most important include Kamuy Fuchi, goddess of the hearth, Kim-un Kamuy, god of bears and mountains, and Repun Kamuy, god of the sea, fishing, and marine animals.\n\nThe Ainu have no priests by profession; instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary. Ceremonies are confined to making libations of sake, saying prayers, and offering willow sticks with wooden shavings attached to them. These sticks are called \"inaw\" (singular) and \"nusa\" (plural).\n\nThey are placed on an altar used to \"send back\" the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called \"Iyomante\". The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of sickness. They believe their spirits are immortal, and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to \"kamuy mosir\" (Land of the Gods).\n\nThe Ainu are part of a larger collective of indigenous people who practice \"arctolatry\" or bear worship. The Ainu believe the bear is very special because they think the bear is Kim-un Kamuy's way of delivering the gift of bear hide and meat to humans.\n\nJohn Batchelor reported that the Ainu view the world as being a spherical ocean on which float many islands, a view based on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. He wrote that they believe the world rests on the back of a large fish, which when it moves causes earthquakes.\n\nAinu assimilated into mainstream Japanese society have adopted Buddhism and Shinto, while some northern Ainu are members of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nMost Hokkaido Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the Hokkaido Utari Association. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese nation-state. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.\n\nOther key institutions include \"The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC)\", set up by the Japanese government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the Hokkaido University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers. Ainu people living in Tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community.\n\nOn March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the Saru River watershed in southern Hokkaido. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan. The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to Nibutani village, the home of a large community of Ainu people and an important center of Ainu culture and history. In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and Kayano Shigeru—well-known and important leaders in the Ainu community. After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaido Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawa's son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaido Development Bureau.\n\nThe final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons—the dam was already standing—but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders. The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as Wajin in the case and discussions about the case. The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japan's Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two weeks later. After the decision was issued, on May 8, 1997, the Diet passed the Ainu Culture Law and repealed the Ainu Protection Act—the 1899 law that had been the vehicle of Ainu oppression for almost one hundred years. While the Ainu Culture Law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings, the shift that it represents in Japan's view of the Ainu people is a testament to the importance of the Nibutani decision. In 2007 the 'Cultural Landscape along the Sarugawa River resulting from Ainu Tradition and Modern Settlement' was designated an Important Cultural Landscape. A later action seeking restoration of Ainu assets held in trust by the Japanese Government was dismissed in 2008.\n\nMuch national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as in Japanese. One such committee operated in the late 1990s, and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law. This panel's circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.\n\nMore recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included. It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.\n\nThe was founded on January 21, 2012, after a group of Ainu activists in Hokkaido announced the formation of a political party for the Ainu on October 30, 2011. The Ainu Association of Hokkaido reported that Kayano Shiro, the son of the former Ainu leader Kayano Shigeru, will head the party. Their aim is to contribute to the realization of a multicultural and multiethnic society in Japan, along with rights for the Ainu.\n\nThe Ainu have historically suffered from economic and social discrimination throughout Japan that continues to this day. The Japanese Government as well as people since contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people. The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaido into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands. The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably the right to speak their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather. These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today. This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaido in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had an 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaido as a whole. The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap. The Japanese government will provide ¥7 million beginning in 2015, to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They numbered around 100 individuals at their peak in the early 1920s, but most have moved on to other countries or become absorbed into the wider Singapore community. They were among the earliest merchants to arrive in Singapore when it was established as a trading port by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819. The Armenian Apostolic Church of St Gregory the Illuminator on Armenian Street, the second church built in Singapore, is today the oldest existing one.\n\nThe early Armenians of Singapore had their origin in Julfa, whose population were deported to Isfahan (forming New Julfa) by Shah Abbas of Persia after he captured the city in 1603. Some of these Armenians then migrated to India and further beyond, and by the 18th century, Armenian communities had established themselves in India (particularly Kolkata), Myanmar, the Malay Peninsula (particularly Penang and Malacca), and Java. Soon after Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore as a trading port in 1819, Armenian merchants arrived in Singapore. The first census of Singapore in 1824 showed 16 Armenians, and the 1826 census showed that there were 16 male and 3 female Armenians in Singapore.\n\nAlthough small in number, the Armenians were active in the commercial activity of early Singapore. Armenian trading firms such as Sarkies and Moses (1840-1914), Apcar & Stephens (1826-1845) and Mackertich M. Moses (1820s-1839) were prominent in Singapore's economy. By the 1830s, Armenian merchants began investing in land. In March 1836 the Church of St Gregory the Illuminator was consecrated, making it the second church in Singapore.\n\nThere were around a hundred individuals in the early 1920s but the number declined. The 1931 census showed 81 Armenians, although actual numbers were around 95. Many of the Armenians, being British subjects, were interned during World War II. By the 1950s, much of the local Armenian community had emigrated to Australia or become part of the larger communities in Singapore. Nevertheless, during the Feast of the Epiphany, the flags of Singapore and Armenia are still raised at the Armenian church.\n\nThe Armenian community in Singapore remains small. There are around a dozen families in Singapore who are descended from the early immigrant families: Aviet, Carapiet, Galestin, Galistan, Johannes, Moses, Sarkies, and Zechariah. In the 2000s, some Armenians have emigrated from Armenia to Singapore.\n\nCatchick Moses (Movessian) (1812-1895), was a co-founder of the Straits Times, which was to become the national English newspaper, in 1845. He sold the paper a year later because it was unprofitable. \n\nThe Sarkies brothers (Martin and Tigran) founded the Raffles Hotel and several other hotels in Southeast Asia, including Eastern Oriental Hotel in Penang Malaysia and Strand Hotel in Yangon, Myanmar (previously known as Rangon Burma) \n\nMartyrose Arathoon who became a partner in Sarkies Brothers in 1917 managed Raffles Hotel during its halycon days of the 1920s.\n\nAgnes Joaquim (Hovakimian) born in Singapore on 7 April 1854, hybridised the orchid named \"Vanda\" Miss Joaquim by Henry Ridley\n\nIn 1899 at a flower show, Agnes unveiled the \"Vanda Miss Joaquim\" for the first time, and won the $12 first prize for her flower. As she was suffering from cancer at that time, Agnes died 3 months later at the same year, at the age of 44. In 1981, the \"Vanda Miss Joaquim\" was designated Singapore's national flower. Her tombstone stands in the Armenian Church in Singapore and reads: \n\nAgnes' younger brother Joaquim P. Joaquim (1856-1902)became one of Singapore's most prominent criminal lawyers. He served as president of the Municipal Council, member of the Legislative Council, and Vice-Consul for the USA.\n\nGeorge Seth, born in 1877 was Solicitor-General of the Straits Settlements in the 1920s.\n\nEmile Galistan, born 1881 was domiciled in Singapore. Galistan owned an extensive collection of orchids and was master at growing them, and he freely shared his knowledge of growing orchids with his regular contributions of articles to the Malayan Orchid Review, the journal of the Malayan Orchid Society that was founded in 1931. He was elected an honorary member of the Society in 1958. Galistan Avenue in Singapore was named after, which recognizes the work of Emile Galistan of the Singapore Improvement Trust.\n\nArmenian expatriates in Singapore include Ashot Nadanian, who has coached the Singapore National Chess Team since 2005 and Gevorg Sargsyan, conductor of Singapore Camerata Chamber Orchestra and Tanglewood Music School since 2008.\n\n\nWright, Nadia H.

{"id": "20311150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20311150", "title": "Blackoutsabbath", "text": "Blackoutsabbath\n\nBlackoutsabbath is a concept created by Canadian-American singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, as promoted by the organization Blackout Sabbath. In an attempt to become more environmentally conscious, participants are asked to live \"off the grid\" as much as possible on a designated date by unplugging appliances, walking or cycling for transportation, turning out lights and decreasing energy usage in any other ways possible.\n\nAs the sun sets on the evening of Blackoutsabbath, participants write down a list of ways they can contribute to the earth's well-being throughout the rest of the year. Annual benefit concerts take place to raise awareness of the cause. The organization's official site contains updates about the program and contains links to various tools, green products and services, studies, and groups that promote energy conservation and environmental protection.\n\nFollowing is a list of \"steps\" to take in order to participate in Blackoutsabbath (dates are geared towards the first celebration in 2008):\n\nOn February 15, Wainwright announced an intimate concert to benefit Blackoutsabbath would take place at Angel Orensanz Foundation in New York City on March 19, 2008. He asked fans to send refrigerator magnets for distribution as part of his initiative, citing \"we've moved on from brooches to refrigerator magnets\" (brooches were worn throughout his \"Release the Stars\" tour). Magnets could be handed to Wainwright directly after concerts or promotional events, or they could be shipped to his management company for collection and later distribution. Special guests performing at the concert included Joan Wasser, Jenni Muldaur and friend and fellow singer-songwriter Teddy Thompson.\n\nThe second annual Blackoutsabbath concert with Wainwright and friends, took place on March 4, 2009 in City Winery in NYC. Scheduled to perform are Teddy Thompson, Jenni Muldaur, Lucy Wainwright Roche, Sloan Wainwright, and Sean Lennon.\n\nOn June 16, Wainwright posted a message on his site reminding fans to participate on the first annual Blackoutsabbath ritual, which would take place on June 21, 2008 from noon to midnight around the world. Citing that his \"message was pretty dry in terms of the comedy section,\" he attached messages written by his mother, Kate McGarrigle, and boyfriend, Jorn Weisbrodt so that readers could \"chuckle a bit\". In her message, McGarrigle encouraged readers to \"\"tune out\" all BlackBerrys, computers, cell phones etc.. \"turn off\" all lights and electrical appliances, host a blackoutsabbath, and \"drop in\"...preferably outdoors...just like the old celebration of the solstice.\" While McGarrigle would celebrate the event in Saint-Sauveur, Quebec with \"like-minded folks\", Weisbrodt revealed in his message that he and Wainwright would be hosting a celebration in Berlin where fans could attend if they RSVP'd appropriately and could find the designated location.\n\nA week following Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright posted messages recapping how he and his friends celebrated the event. He stated the night prior to June 21 involved mostly planning, including food arrangements, how to get his guitar to the apartment (\"one of the old Communist towers on Karl Marx Allee\"), and how he would be \"going down and up five flights of stairs on the hour\" to bring guests up to their room. On Blackoutsabbath, Wainwright and Weisbrodt unplugged their appliances at noon and spent the day browsing for magnets at museums, napping and preparing for the party. Once guests arrived, candles were lit and in between trips to greet guests Wainwright and Robert Wilson performed Shakespearean sonnets from a project they were collaborating on. Wainwright admitted he \"felt a bit dorky strumming on the guitar and asking everyone to change their lightbulbs, especially since Germany compared to the US is miles ahead in terms of energy conservation.\" By midnight, guests had completed their refrigerator lists. In his message, Wainwright encouraged fans to continue the Blackoutsabbath tradition by hosting small parties, sharing their stories on the website and inviting friends with knowledge of conservation (\"your crazy hippie friend!\") to moderate discussion and share their awareness with others.\n\nIn November 2008, Blackout Sabbath and Global Inheritance partnered with Focus Features to host a charity auction to raise money for the two organizations. The auction winner won an early screening of Gus Van Sant's film, \"Milk\", starring Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. The screening took place at a movie theater local to the winner, who was able to invite up to 50 friends to attend the event. The auction began on November 3 and closed on November 11. 100% of the funds raised was split between the organizations.\n\n"}
{"id": "15772623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15772623", "title": "Botifarra (card game)", "text": "Botifarra (card game)\n\nBotifarra () is a point trick-taking card game for four players in fixed partnerships played in Catalonia, the Northeast country of Spain, and parts of Aragon and Castelló province. It is a historical game also played in many parts of Spain, not only in bars and coffee shops. The game is closely related to Manille from which it takes the mechanics, but its rules induce deduction and minimise the effects of luck.\n\nBotifarra is a point trick card game in which the points in the tricks are most important, rather than the number of tricks, although a trick also has a value by itself. The game is usually played for 101 points or more, and this requires several hands. \n\nThe point value of each card is as follows:\n\n\nIn addition to the points for cards listed above, one point is added for every trick won.\n\nBotifarra is played with a Spanish 48-card deck whose suits are Coins, Cups, Swords and Batons running from 1 to 12. The card order is 9 (high), Ace, King, Horse, Jack, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (low). The dealer deals the whole deck counterclockwise in batches of four cards. After each hand the turn to deal and play always passes to the right. Usually, dealer's right hand opponent shuffles the deck and the left hand opponent cuts.\n\nThe trump suit or Botifarra (No trump - NT) is either chosen by the dealer or he may pass the privilege to his partner. If the dealer passes, the partner must choose a suit or No trumps, for he cannot pass the right to choose. \n\nAfter the trump suit or Botifarra is selected, either of the defenders can double (Contrar) the hand if they want to, and if doubled, either of the members of the dealer's team can redouble (Recontrar) the hand. If redoubled, the defenders can re-redouble (Sant Vicens) the contract. \n\nWhen the game played is Botifarra, the score may be doubled, and Contrar, Recontrar and Sant Vicens can double it further, so that there could be up to 4 doubles in the game. So, the order in which the players have the opportunity to double is: \n\nThe player to the right of the dealer leads first, known as \"palo de salida\". Any card may be played, and suit must be followed if possible, otherwise, trump must be played if possible, otherwise any card may be played. The winner of each trick then leads to the next. The tricks are stored face down in front of one of the members of each team, and they can not be consulted, except for the last trick played. Each trick is won by the highest trump played or, if no trump is played, by the highest card played of the suit led, or if a no-trump contract is played, by the highest card of the suit led. \n\nThe points scored by each partnership are counted and the team who won the hand will then record the corresponding number of points. The player who dealt the cards and selected trumps in the previous hand will be responsible for shuffling the cards, the player to his left will cut the deck and the player to his right will deal the cards and select trumps. \n\nIn some versions of the game, the cards are never shuffled at the start of each hand. The two piles of cards from the previous hand are simply placed on top of each other and the deck is cut by the next player in order of play. This means that the cards will be distributed in such a way that the probability of acquiring a singular hand will be high.\n\nA revoke is penalised by the loss of all the points won so far during the play. The opponents score 36 points in the case of a normal hand and 72 in a botifarra (NT) hand.\n\nA misdeal leads to the start of a new hand, but is not penalised with any points. The player to the right of the person who misdealt then deals and makes the trump choice, thus making the initial dealer lose out on the option of selecting trumps himself.\n\nWhen playing Botifarra you must also bear in mind that it is forbidden to speak, show your cards or make signs or comments that may reveal your cards or your opinion as to whether game decisions are good or bad. Despite this, it is quite normal to make some comments during the game, which adds to a more entertaining atmosphere.\n\n\n"}

The 20-year-old driver of the car, James Alex Fields Jr., had previously espoused neo-Nazi and white supremacist beliefs.\nFields was charged with hit and run, first-degree murder of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, multiple counts of federal hate crimes for injuring 28 others, and other crimes.\n\nA memorial service and vigils were organized. The mayor of Charlottesville, the Virginia Secretary of Public Safety, the Attorney General and the FBI director called the attack domestic terrorism.\n\nThe Unite the Right rally was a white supremacist rally that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia from August 11 to 12, 2017. Jason Kessler, the organizer of the rally, had been protesting for months the proposed removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park in Charlottesville.\n\nIndividuals and groups of different beliefs and tactics demonstrated against the rally. Many counter-protesters were ready to turn out despite the threat of violence. Protesters and some militant counterprotesters were attacking each other.\n\nOn August 12, 2017, a maroon minivan and a white Toyota Camry sedan behind it were driving down the Fourth Street Southeast crossing of the Downtown Mall toward Water Street and were stopped by a large group of counter-protesters who decided to walk up Fourth Street Southeast in the direction of Market Street. A gray 2010 Dodge Challenger drove down Fourth Street Southeast mall crossing and idled for a short time behind the white Toyota at the Downtown Mall. It then backed up and traveled more than a block before rapidly accelerating.\n\nAt around 1:45 p.m. on August 12, 2017, the 2010 Dodge Challenger impacted a crowd of counter-protesters while driving at a high speed. It audibly rammed pedestrians and struck the white sedan. The impact reportedly \"[shoved] tons of metal into the crowd\" and sent people \"flying through the air\" and over another car near the intersection with Water Street East. The struck vehicle also hit the maroon minivan ahead, \"sending that vehicle into more pedestrians\". A few seconds after the initial impact, Fields drove in reverse—hitting more people—with his car's front bumper \"scraping the road\". Pedestrians who had avoided the attack chased Fields along Fourth Street.\n\nFields backed up at a high speed for several blocks, and then turned left and sped off down Market Street. A Virginia State Police Bell 407 helicopter, that crashed about three hours later, was following the car and relaying its route to ground units. A deputy stopped and arrested Fields on Monticello Avenue, about a mile from the attack. The deputy waited for the police to arrive, and detective Steven Young came from the police department. According to Young, Fields kept apologizing and asked if anyone was injured. When Young told him that a person had died, Fields appeared shocked and started to cry. Young said that the Dodge had holes in the rear window—made by counter-protesters after the initial impact—and heavy front-end damage; Young said that the car was \"splattered\" with blood and flesh. A pair of blue sunglasses was stuck in the spoiler on the car's trunk.\n\nHeather Heyer, a 32-year-old woman, was fatally injured in the attack, and died at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Initially, nineteen injuries were reported, as twenty patients were taken at the University of Virginia Medical Center. In the evening, five people were in critical condition and fourteen others were being treated for lesser injuries. Nine people had been discharged and ten remained hospitalized in good condition the next day. Testimony at the preliminary hearing in December 2017 revealed that a total of 35 people were injured.\n\nThe organizer of the Unite the Right rally, Jason Kessler, held a news conference near the Charlottesville City Hall the day after the car attack. A crowd of around a hundred counter-protesters shouted him down, screaming \"murderer\". A few protesters then broke through the line of reporters and headed toward Kessler. The police brought Kessler into the City Hall after a counter-protester made an obscene gesture and another counter-protester lunged at him. Twenty minutes later, the police formed a line and Kessler ran out of a door at the side of the building and lunged into the back of a marked police SUV. As the SUV sped away, a single counter-protester chased it, yelling, \"Shame! Shame! Shame!\" In February 2018, three were found guilty of assaulting Kessler at the news conference and a case against a person charged with spitting on Kessler was continued until February 2019 at the request of the prosecution.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr. (born April 26, 1997) was the driver of the car. Fields grew up with his mother Samantha Bloom, a paraplegic, in Florence, Kentucky. After living in southwest Florence for ten years, they moved to Monclova Township, Lucas County, Ohio for her job in late 2016. Fields' mother told the \"Toledo Blade\" that he had \"recently moved out on his own\".\n\nUntil his arrest in Charlottesville, Fields worked for about two years as a security guard in Ohio; he earned per hour and his income was $650 every two weeks. According to acquaintances, Fields \"filled his time\" playing video games and working at a local grocery store.\n\nAccording to Fields' high school history teacher, Derek Weimer, Fields was prescribed an antipsychotic as anger management medication after he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Fields told a judge that he was receiving treatment for bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nFields' father was killed in a car crash on December 5, 1996, five months before he was born. Bloom's parents died in a murder-suicide when she was 16 on August 21, 1984 when Bloom's father, 42-year-old self-employed contractor Marvin killed his 37-year-old ex-wife Judy, and himself.\n\nFields threatened his mother with violence on multiple occasions. In November 2010, in a bathroom she locked, afraid of her son, Fields' mother reported to the police that he had threatened to beat her, took her phone, smacked her head, and put his hands over her mouth, after she told him to stop playing video games. In February 2011, Fields' mother reported to the police at 5:20 a.m. that he had not come home; she said that he was wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Two hours later, she reported to the police that Fields \"was home and acting lethargic\"; he threatened to run away \"if police came to the condo\". In October 2011, Fields threatened her with a knife; she called the police the next day to say that her son had been \"very threatening\" toward her and that she was scared and did not feel in control of the situation because she was in a wheelchair. In November 2011, Fields spat in his mother's face and threatened her, and a woman requested that the police help Fields' mother get him to a hospital for assessment; the log for the call reads, \"Mom is scared he is going to become violent here.\" Fields was subsequently arrested and held in juvenile detention.\n\nWhen he was a senior in high school, Fields applied to join the Army, and Weimer, who was a former Ohio National Guard officer, helped him because Weimer believed that the military \"would expose Fields to people of different races and backgrounds and help him dispel his white supremacist views\". Fields was turned down which Weimer called a \"big blow\". Fields entered the Army on August 18, 2015 and was released from active duty \"due to a failure to meet training standards\" on December 11, the same year. Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson said that Fields \"was never awarded a military occupational skill nor was he assigned to a unit outside of basic training\". Weimer lost contact with Fields after he had graduated, and was \"surprised\" when he heard that Fields had enlisted in the Army.\n\nFields graduated Randall K. Cooper High School in 2015.\n\nFields purchased his first car, the 2010 Dodge Challenger, used in the attack, from a Cincinnati metropolitan area car dealership in Florence in June 2015. The car was last registered in Ohio, and Fields updated its title in Maumee, Ohio in July 2015. \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" reported that, according to local court records, he was cited for expired or unlawful license plates by the Maumee police in May 2017.\n\nAn ex-schoolmate of Fields said that Fields would draw swastikas and talk about \"loving Hitler\" as early as middle school. Fields' high school history teacher said that Fields was \"deeply into Adolf Hitler and white supremacy\". The teacher, Derek Weimer, reportedly taught Fields in three classes at Randall K. Cooper High School and \"had regular interaction with him after classes and during free time\". He told \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\", \"I'm sure if you would ask James he would say I was his favorite or one of his favorite teachers.\" Weimer said that Fields was \"a very bright kid but very misguided and disillusioned\". Weimer said, \"Once you talked to James for a while, you would start to see that sympathy towards Nazism, that idolization of Hitler, that belief in white supremacy. It would start to creep out.\" Weimer said that he had done his best to steer Fields away from those interests and had thought that he had succeeded in doing so. He said that he felt like he failed as a teacher because of the attack, but that \"this is definitely a teachable moment and something we need to be vigilant about, because this stuff is tearing up our country\". Weimer said that another teacher had filed a report during Fields' freshman year because he had written something that was \"very much along the party lines of the neo-Nazi movement\". He said that it \"would have been standard procedure\" to notify Fields' mother and that the school administrators \"were very good about keeping parents in the loop\".\n\nAccording to Weimer, Fields \"left school for a while\" and became quieter about politics when he came back, until his senior year, when the candidates for the 2016 presidential election were declared. Weimer said that Fields supported Donald Trump because of what he perceived were Trump's racial views. According to Weimer, Fields supported Trump's Mexico border proposal. Weimer said that Fields \"admired\" the Confederate States of America for their military, though they \"never spoke about slavery\". Weimer said that \"the constant presence of the Confederate flag was an ongoing issue\" and that an African-American cheerleader was \"very uncomfortable having to ride in a parade being carried by a pickup truck with a large Confederate flag sticker\". Fields reportedly made students feel \"unnerved\" and \"unsafe\", and one woman told \"The New York Times\", \"On many occasions there were times he would scream obscenities, whether it be about Hitler or racial slurs.\" Fields' roommate on a class trip to Europe in 2015 told the Associated Press that Fields went on the trip only to visit Germany, and referred to it as the Fatherland. He couldn't handle being in a room with Fields after Fields spoke about French people \"being lower than us and inferior to us\". Fields voted in the March 15, 2016 Ohio Republican primary.\n\nFields' mother said that he had a pet cat, and that she was taking care of it during the rally. She did not know that her son was attending a white supremacist rally; instead, she thought that he was attending a Donald Trump-related rally. She told him \"to be careful, and if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully\". She said that she \"would be surprised if her son's views were so far right that he would attend a white supremacist rally\" and that he had an African-American friend. She told the \"Toledo Blade\" that she had not spoken with her son about his political views. Fields' Facebook page included memes and symbols associated with the far-right. At the Unite the Right rally, the morning of the attack, Fields was seen wielding a Vanguard America shield. Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi organization, stated that it was not associated with Fields. There is no evidence that Fields was affiliated with any of the groups assembled that day.\n\nFields was initially charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of hit and run. On August 12, the Justice Department announced a joint civil rights investigation into the incident conducted by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. NPR's Carrie Johnson reported that investigators wanted to know whether Fields had crossed state lines with the intent to commit violence. A Department of Justice official said that federal hate crime charges could be applied to the case and that they would \"investigate whether others may have been involved in planning the attack\". Lisa Monaco, Homeland Security Advisor to President Barack Obama, raised the question of whether the attack would be investigated as domestic terrorism. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on \"Good Morning America\" on August 14 that the attack met the definition of domestic terrorism. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that civil rights division FBI agents and FBI terrorism investigators were working on the case. FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said that the attack met the definition of domestic terrorism. Fields was scheduled to appear in court on August 14. He appeared via video from jail and was denied bail. Fields said that he could not afford a lawyer; a private attorney was appointed by the judge, as a public defender could not be appointed due to a conflict of interest. The next hearing for Fields was set for August 25.\n\nA week later, Fields was charged with two additional counts of malicious wounding, and three counts of aggravated malicious wounding. Charlottesville Police Lieutenant Steve Upman said in a release, \"The victims related to these charges suffered serious injuries and in some cases permanent physical disabilities.\" The investigation remained under the Charlottesville police, the FBI and the DOJ.\n\nAt the preliminary hearing in December 2017, State District Court Judge Robert H. Downer Jr. certified all ten charges to a grand jury. The certified charges were one count of first-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, three counts of aggravated malicious wounding, two counts of felonious assault and one count of hit and run. Video footage of the surveying helicopter and surveillance video footage from a restaurant near the mall crossing were shown. Surveillance video footage from the restaurant reportedly showed the Dodge Challenger zooming past \"a string of vehicles\" heading south on Fourth Street Southeast.\n\nOn January 3, 2018, Fields waived his right to a speedy trial, and his trial was scheduled to begin on November 26, 2018, and last three weeks.\nOn June 27, 2018, as reported by the DOJ's Office of Public Affairs, a W.D. Va. federal grand jury charged Fields under two hate crime statutes with multiple federal hate crimes:\n\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said of the indictment, \"Last summer's violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation. Today's indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation.\" W.D. Va. Attorney Thomas T. Cullen called the indictment \"the culmination of a 10-month investigation that involved searching the social media accounts where Mr. Fields showed an interest in harming minorities\". Adam S. Lee, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Richmond Division, said, \"Heyer did not go to the event looking for a fight. She was looking to lend her voice to her cause. Peaceful protest without intimidation, without the threat of violence is every American's birthright.\"\n\nOn July 5, 2018, Fields pleaded not guilty to all 30 counts of federal hate crime charges.\n\nThe trial was set to begin on November 26, 2018.\nHeather Danielle Heyer (May 29, 1985 – August 12, 2017) was the only person killed in the attack.\n\nHeyer grew up in Ruckersville, Virginia, and graduated from William Monroe High School in Stanardsville, Virginia. She worked as a bartender and waitress. She was approached by Alfred A. Wilson, the manager of the bankruptcy division at the Miller Law Group in Charlottesville. Heyer did not have a background in law; Wilson hired her at the recommendation of a friend and said that she \"had an eye for detail\" and was \"a people person\". He reportedly told her, \"If you can get people to open up to you, that's what I need. I'll teach you everything about the law you need to know.\" She continued her job as a waitress while working at the law firm. Wilson said that Heyer did not take any vacations during her first two years at Miller Law Group. Heyer left her boyfriend after he made a racist comment about Wilson.\n\nHeyer lived alone. Her friends described her \"as a passionate advocate for the disenfranchised who was often moved to tears by the world's injustices\", and said that she \"spoke out against inequality and urged co-workers to be active in their community\". According to Heyer's mother Susan Bro, Heyer would ask people of opposing views why they had come to their beliefs. Bro said that she and Heyer advocated for Black Lives Matter, which Bro said fights for equal treatment.\n\nHeyer and a longtime friend of hers had agreed not to protest the Unite the Right rally, because they thought it would be too dangerous, but the night before the protests, Heyer felt compelled to go.\n\nA memorial service was held at the Paramount Theater, two blocks from the attack location, on August 16. More than a thousand people attended the service, many of them wearing sashes and ribbons. Present were Governor Terry McAuliffe (D-VA), junior Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) and gubernatorial candidate and former Counselor to the President Ed Gillespie (R-VA).\n\nHeyer's mother Susan Bro delivered a speech calling for people to fight \"as Heather would do\". A standing ovation lasted nearly a minute and a half after Bro said, \"They tried to kill my child to shut her up, but guess what, you just magnified her.\" Bro said that she had received hundreds of messages from people inspired by Heyer asking for advice. A woman played \"Amazing Grace\" and \"America the Beautiful\" on a saxophone. Heyer's father Mark Heyer said that Heather had been \"defiant, strong-willed and compassionate\" and that she \"always argued for what she thought was right\".\n\nSeveral people with purple shields, pink bats and pink helmets with a heart drawn on each were observing outside the theater to stop any \"fascist groups\" that might disrupt the event. No problems were reported outside the theater. As the service ended, Bro asked someone in the audience to stop criticizing President Trump.\nPoliticians were confronted outside the memorial service. After being asked about it, McAuliffe told a man that Virginia law leaves the removal of Confederate statues to local communities. Kaine was asked why the Charlottesville police \"had failed to head off the weekend's violent clashes\" and he \"said [that] city officials had promised an independent review of the police response\".\n\nA vigil in remembrance of Heyer was planned for August 13 night, but was cancelled due to a \"credible threat from white supremacists\". People gathered and prayed at the site of the attack in spite of the cancellation.\n\nHundreds of people gathered at the University of Virginia and in other U.S. cities, including Philadelphia and Akron, Ohio.\n\nMichael Wilson, Principal of the Randall K. Cooper High School that Fields had attended, said: \"As educators, we are always using teachable moments and providing guidance to students to create college, career and life ready students to make good and sound choices. [...] We're all educators and we all are reflecting on what did we miss, or what could we do better. We do that with any student who may have made a wrong choice.\" He said that his staff sent thoughts and prayers to Charlottesville. Wilson said that the faculty members were worried about the victims and concerned about Fields.\n\nPrincipal Wilson called Fields a \"quiet and reserved student\". Fields was described as \"shy\" and \"quiet\" by his ex-classmates and neighbors. A woman who went to school with Fields told \"The New York Times\" that he \"mostly kept to himself\" and \"didn't start fights or try to fight\", but described him as \"exceptionally odd and an outcast to be sure\". However, Fields' roommate on a class trip to Europe in 2015 told the Associated Press, \"He had friends, he had people who would chat with him, it wasn't like he was an outcast.\"\n\nBoone County Schools spokeswoman Barbara Brady said that school officials \"were not aware of any situation at Cooper High regarding Fields' behavior at the time of his enrollment\". Brady questioned the trustworthiness of reports by Fields' ex-classmates, criticizing them for not reporting incidents.\n\nThe city of Charlottesville and its City Council published a statement: \"This senseless act of violence rips a hole in our collective hearts. While it will never make up for the loss of a member of our community, we will pursue charges against the driver of the vehicle that caused her death and are confident justice will prevail.\" Mayor Michael Signer called the attack domestic terrorism and blamed white supremacists. In a statement on August 18, Mayor Michael Signer called on the City Council to \"take concrete steps to memorialize Heather's name and legacy.\" Signer asked the governor to convene an emergency General Assembly session to allow Charlottesville to remove the statue of Robert E. Lee.\n\nBrian Moran, the Virginia Secretary of Public Safety, said, \"He was a terrorist to do what he did.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement, \"The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated. Justice will prevail.\"\n\nOn August 17, White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said that Trump would meet with Heyer's family.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump praised Heyer as \"an incredible young woman\". Heyer's mother Susan Bro thanked Trump for his August 14 remarks on the event. She wrote in a statement: \"Thank you, President Trump, for those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred. My condolences, also, to the grieving families of the two state troopers and quick recovery for those injured.\"\n\nIn the August 15 statement, widely condemned as downplaying white supremacists, Trump said about Bro's statement on Trump's August 14 statement:\n\nBro initially declined to respond to Trump's August 15 statement as she was busy and tired. After Bro saw Trump's August 15 statement, she said that she would not talk to Trump.\n\nTrump tweeted about the memorial service the morning of the day that it occurred. No Trump administration officials were present at the service.\n\nJason Kessler, the organizer of the Unite the Right rally, said that none of the organizers knew Fields. After being unable to hold a press conference due to violence, he accused the city of \"shutting down\" speech and said that the city officials \"failed to separate the protest groups and were ill-equipped to handle the melee that resulted\". White supremacist rally speaker Richard B. Spencer placed the blame for the attack on authorities, who \"failed to keep order\". Spencer refused to condemn Fields, saying, \"This man could have lost control because he felt in danger and slammed on the accelerator and unintentionally killed someone.\"\n\nOn August 18, 2017, Kessler wrote on Twitter: \"Heather Heyer was a fat, disgusting Communist. Communists have killed 94 million. Looks like it was payback time.\" Kessler deleted the tweet the next day, initially saying he was hacked, but later claiming he had been on a mixture of drugs. Other white nationalists criticized Kessler for the tweet, including Richard Spencer, who wrote: \"I will no longer associate w/ Jason Kessler; no one should. Heyer's death was deeply saddening. 'Payback' is a morally reprehensible idea.\"\n\nHeyer's mother Susan Bro said that she did not want people to hate Fields. She said that it was not what her daughter would have wanted.\n\nHeyer's father Mark said that \"people on all sides need to learn to forgive each other\".\n\nOn the last day of his job, photojournalist Ryan Kelly took a photograph of the attack for \"The Daily Progress\", the sole daily newspaper in the vicinity of Charlottesville. On April 16, 2018, Kelly won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography.\n\nPhotographer Jeremiah Knupp also took a photograph of the attack, working for \"The News Leader\", a daily newspaper serving Staunton, Virginia and the surrounding areas. Knupp took the photograph from a pole on the parking garage, south-west of the intersection of Water Street and Fourth Street Southeast.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign created to support Heyer's family had surpassed in a day. Fundraising websites removed campaigns that had sought to fund Fields' legal defense. The Democratic Socialists of America quickly raised , but were criticized for the convoluted application process for victims and timeliness in addressing their applications. The money raised was eventually transferred to the National Compassion Fund for management and disbursement.\n\nHeyer's mother Susan Bro started the nonprofit Heather Heyer Foundation. It was funded from the GoFundMe campaign and from new donations. Bro said that the foundation would be devoted to civil rights and provide scholarships to people who want social justice. She quit her job as a secretary and bookkeeper for a Virginia Cooperative Extension office after the attack, and became the president and chair of the board of the Heather Heyer Foundation.\n\nOn August 15, 2017, Tadrint and Micah Washington, who were in the white sedan that was hit during the attack, filed a US$3 million lawsuit in damages against Jason Kessler, James Alex Fields Jr., Richard Spencer and 30 other groups and individuals.\n\nIn September 2017, New York's 25th Assembly district Representative Nily Rozic, a Democrat, filed a bill and petitioned the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation to rename the Donald J. Trump State Park in honor of Heyer. \n\nOn December 20, 2017, a part of Fourth Street Southeast in Charlottesville, where the attack occurred, was designated Honorary Heather Heyer Way.\n\nOn the afternoon of May 12, 2018, Heyer's close friend Marissa Blair married her fiancé Marcus Martin, who pushed her out of the car's way and was injured in the attack himself. During the ceremony, Bro led a butterfly release in remembrance of Heyer.\n\nSusan Bro presented the 2017 MTV Video Music Award for Best Fight Against the System. \n\nThe 2018 film \"BlacKkKlansman\" features video footage of the attack; the film ends with a dedication to Heyer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7077315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7077315", "title": "Cochimí", "text": "Cochimí\n\nThe Cochimí were the aboriginal inhabitants of the central part of the Baja California peninsula, from El Rosario in the north to San Javier in the south.\n\nThey spoke a set of dialects or closely related languages that have been classified in a variety of ways. The most prominent division, between Northern Cochimí and Southern Cochimí, has generally been put to the south of San Ignacio (Mixco 1978, 1979, 2006; Laylander 1997). At one time designated \"Peninsular Yuman\", Cochimí bears an evident relationship to the Yuman languages of northern Baja California, southern California, and western Arizona. Mauricio J. Mixco (1978, 2006) reassessed this relationship and judged it to be too distant for Cochimí to be included within the Yuman family proper. He placed Cochimí as a sister language to the Yuman family, thus forming the Yuman–Cochimí family.\n\nThe Cochimí were first encountered by Spanish seaborne explorers during the sixteenth century, including Ulloa, Cabrillo, Vizcaíno, and others. Sporadic encounters continued until the Jesuits established missions on the peninsula in the late seventeenth century. Eusebio Francisco Kino made an abortive foundation at San Bruno, to the north of Loreto, in 1683-1685. Juan María de Salvatierra began the first successful mission in 1697 at Loreto among the Monqui, who were southern neighbors of the Cochimí. This was quickly followed by Francesco Maria Piccolo's Cochimí mission at San Javier in 1699. Over the next seven decades, the frontier of Jesuit control over the Cochimí gradually extended northward, with missions at Mulegé (1705, Comondú (1708), La Purísima (1720), Guadalupe (1720), San Ignacio (1728), Santa Gertrudis (1751), San Borja (1762), and Santa María (1767). After the Spanish crown expelled the Jesuits from Baja California in 1768, the Franciscans under Junípero Serra established an additional mission at San Fernando Velicatá (1769) on their way north to Alta California. The Franciscans' successors in Baja California, the Dominicans, created the final new mission among the Cochimí at El Rosario (1774). Decimated by epidemics of Old World diseases, the Cochimí population declined, until sometime in the nineteenth or possibly the early twentieth century their language and traditional culture became extinct.\n\nThe Cochimí were hunter-gatherers, without agriculture or metallurgy. Pottery-making may have reached the northern Cochimí before Spanish contact (Rogers 1945). Their material culture was generally simple, but it suited their arid environment and mobile lifestyle. The highest level of social organization was the autonomous local community, and inter-community conflicts appear to have been frequent. Among the unusual cultural traits noted for the Cochimí and some of their neighbors were the second harvest of the pitahaya, the \"maroma\", wooden \"tablas\", and human-hair capes:\n\n\nInformation on Cochimí customs and beliefs has been preserved in the brief observations by explorers but, above all, in the writings of the Jesuits (Aschmann 1959; Laylander 2000; Mathes 2006). Particularly important and detailed are the works of Miguel Venegas (1757, 1979) and Miguel del Barco (1973).\n\nThe Cochimí language was part of the Yuman–Cochimí family.\n\n"}
{"id": "42323630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42323630", "title": "Corruption in Uzbekistan", "text": "Corruption in Uzbekistan\n\nCorruption in Uzbekistan is a serious problem. There are laws in place to prevent corruption, but the enforcement is very weak. Low prosecution rates of corrupt officials is another contributing factor to the rampant corruption in Uzbekistan. It is not a criminal offense for a non-public official to influence the discretion of a public official. The judicial system faces severe functional deficits due to limited resources and corruption.\n\nIn Uzbekistan, corruption is present at virtually every level of society, business, and government. It is also one of the world's most corrupt countries, and among the contributory factors is its possessing the second largest economy in Central Asia, its large reserves of natural gas, and its geographical position between the rival powers of the so-called Cold War II.\n\nTransparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 157th place out of 180 countries.\n\n“Graft and bribery among low and mid-level officials are part of everyday life and are sometimes even transparent,” states Freedom House, which adds that the ubiquity of corruption helps to “limit equality of opportunity.”\n\nA 2015 report by Amnesty International quotes a businessman who was arrested and tortured in 2011, as saying that corruption in Uzbekistan is a “cancer that had spread everywhere.”\n\nBribery, nepotism, and extortion are common throughout the Uzbek public sector.\n\nUzbek artist Vyacheslav Okhunov told \"Der Spiegel\" in 2015 that the late Islam Karimov, then Uzbekistan's president, was \"a dictator\" who exhibits Mafioso tendencies. Karimov has been accused of ruling Uzbekistan with an iron fist for a quarter-century, shaping a culture that \"has a greater resemblance to North Korea than China.\" Critics have sardonically noted that there is almost no televised news broadcast that does not feature Karimov \"cutting a ribbon for some new facility somewhere\". According to the Heritage Foundation, Karimov's absolute power extended to judicial appointments.\n\nFreedom House has reported that Karimov exercised total power over the legislature, which acts as a \"rubber stamp\" that approved Karimov's decisions. The group states that Karimov's virtually absolute power allowed him to exploit every sphere of activity in his country for personal economic benefit.\n\nEven after his death in office, Karimov's influence has remained firm enough to allow his handpicked successor, Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev, to be acting President pending the Presidential by-election in blatant disregard to the Constitution, which places that responsibility at the hands of the President of the Senate.\n\nThe president's daughter, Gulnara Karimova, has (like the president himself) been associated with large-scale corruption. A Swiss criminal investigation begun in 2012 was directed at first against four Uzbek citizens who had connections to Karimova. Two of them were arrested that year and released on bail. Also in 2012, a Swedish television documentary stated that a Swedish telecommunications company, TeliaSonera AB, had paid $320 million to Takilant (a Gibraltar-based shell company reportedly linked to Karimova) in exchange for licenses and frequencies in Uzbekistan.\n\nIn January 2013, Swedish investigators released new documents apparently showing that TeliaSonera had tried to negotiate directly with Karimova. In the same year, U.S. and Dutch authorities began investigating Karimova.\n\nIn February 2014, the chief executive of TeliaSonera was forced to resign after serious failures of due diligence were uncovered. In May, the Swedish media made documents public that suggested Karimova had aggressively dictated the terms of the TeliaSonera contract and threatened it with obstructions. Related money-laundering investigations in Switzerland and Sweden continued throughout the year, and hundreds of millions of dollars in accounts connected to the case being frozen by authorities.\nIn March 2014, Swiss authorities began a money-laundering investigation into Karimova, and prosecutors in Bern said that the evidence had led their investigation into Sweden and France and that they had \"seized assets in excess of 800 million Swiss francs ($912 million).\" According to Swiss newspaper \"Le Temps\", of the seized funds 500 million francs of the seized funds involved TeliaSonera and the remained \"involved Karimova's personal assets.\"\n\nIn 2014, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated TeliaSonera as well as the Amsterdam-based Vimpelcom Ltd. and the Russian firm Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS) on suspicion that these three firms had funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to firms controlled by Karimova. An August 2015 report stated that U.S. prosecutors were asking authorities in Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Switzerland to seize assets of about $1 billion in connection with their investigation. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported in January 2015 that executives at the Norwegian telecom firm Telenor, which owns one-third of Vimpelcom, had knowledge about millions in bribes.\n\nIn March 2015, DOJ asked Sweden to freeze $30 million in funds held by the Stockholm-based Nordea Bank. The DOJ probe discovered that firms had \"paid bribes to Uzbek officials to obtain mobile telecommunications business in Uzbekistan.\" European investigators revealed that Takilant was run by a former Karimova aide.\n\nA July 2015 report stated that U.S. authorities were seeking to seize $300 million in bank accounts in Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium, alleging that the funds were bribes paid to Karimova.\n\nIn August 2015, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported that Uzbek authorities had arrested nine suspects in connection with probes, including two top executives at a Coca-Cola bottling plant in Uzbekistan, which Karimova formerly owned.\n\n\"There are no free elections in Uzbekistan,\" according to Freedom House. In the April 2015 election, Karimov received 90.39% of the vote, winning a fourth term, although the constitution restricts presidents to two terms. Election observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were critical of the conduct of the election, and Steve Swerdlow of Human Rights Watch called it a “sham.”\n\nCorruption is widespread in Uzbekistan's judiciary. The judiciary system is officially independent, but corruption is rampant, and the law actually allows certain kinds of government interference and “equivocation.” Public officials, lawyers, and judges often “interpret local legislation inconsistently and in conflict with each other.” Corruption is a standard feature of legal proceedings, mainly in conflicts between firms. Judges are said to take bribes and kickbacks from individuals and companies in exchange for favorable verdicts. The judiciary is under the control of the executive, is riddled with nepotism, favoritism, and kickbacks, and is characterized by “unreliable and non-transparent” appeals processes. “Bribery, abuse of office and vague interpretation of laws” result in unfair decisions. In commercial cases, courts reportedly favor local companies over foreign firms. Courts are also alleged to address corruption charges against high-level officials only on presidential orders. Although the judicial system is required to uphold “investor rights and the sanctity of contracts,” in practice it is said to regularly favor \"state-owned or government-affiliated entities.”\n\nCourt procedures in Uzbekistan, states the Heritage Foundation, \"fall short of international standards, and powerful figures can expropriate property with impunity\". In addition, private property can be confiscated by the government for no reason, with no system for registering liens on chattel in place.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, corruption is ingrained in Uzbekistan's justice system. Torture (in the form of \"beatings, asphyxiation, rape and sexual assault\") is a widely used by law enforcement and the authorities. Torture is used to \"extract confessions, to intimidate entire families or to extract bribes.\" Family members are tortured to extract confessions and \"on the basis of these confessions, [torture survivors] have been sentenced to long terms in prison after unfair trials.\"\n\nThe Uzbekistani National Security Service has been reported to have engaged in torture.\n\nCorruption within the Uzbek police force has been described as \"pervasive.\" Extortion is common, and police regularly use false charges to dissuade anyone from reporting their corruption crimes to higher bureaus. A 2014 report stated that police corruption had risen recently owing to the currency exchange market coming under the control of known criminal groups.\n\nCorruption is common in the public-services sector. Civil servants are low-paid and thus included to solicit and extort bribes, according to the \"Business Anti-Corruption Portal\". Officials extort payments from companies in connection with the granting of permits and licenses, and “use arbitrary inspections and punitive sanctions to harass companies, to interfere with their business operations and to reduce market competition.”\n\nJudicial corruption prevents the protection or enforcement of property rights. The \"Business Anti-Corruption Portal\" reports that the state routinely expropriates private property, providing opportunities for extortion and corruption.\n\nWhile over 2-3 million Uzbeks (mostly university students as a full-time workers for over 3 months, teachers, professors, doctors as a part-time for over 3 months) “were forced to work on cotton fields” during the 2014 harvest, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), officials were alleged to have embezzled substantial funds from the operation. “Impossibly high quotas were reportedly set, with workers forced to pay fines to make up the deficits.” The Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights called the quotas an 'unprecedented degree of extortion', as workers were made to continue their labor in exchange for food and housing.\n\nCorruption is said to be common in the Uzbek tax administration. The vague and ambiguous tax laws allow for official corruption, often in the form of bribery and extortion at the expense of foreign companies. Firms involved in judicial disputes are subject to the seizure of assets by tax officials, according to the \"Business Anti-Corruption Portal\".\n\nUzbekistan's customs sector is riddled with corruption. Customs officials and border guards are reported to take bribes from smugglers, as a result of which the amount of smuggling increases annually.\n\nSeveral senior officials of the Tashkent Province State Customs Committee were arrested on bribery charges in October 2014. They were accused of extorting bribes, participating in organized crime, and eliciting favors in exchange for employment at the customs offices. The fees for clearing goods across borders are arbitrary, and foreign firms say that customs restrictions are “among the most severe challenges to doing business in Uzbekistan.”\n\nCorruption is ubiquitous in the public procurement sector, which is characterized by widespread conflicts of interest, a lack of transparency, and bribes being extorted in exchange for government contracts. There is a reported lack of transparency during the bidding for contracts from the government.\n\nAccording to anti-corruption groups, most of the foreign firms that are awarded profitable contracts have ties to Uzbekistan's ruling elite. Foreign firms, explains one source, \"regularly experience expropriations, politically motivated inspections and discrimination by authorities\" in Uzbekistan. According to the U.S. Department of State, foreign firms “have reported numerous procedural infractions in both the Economic and Criminal courts of Uzbekistan and the Embassy knows of a number of cases in which foreign companies did not receive timely payments from local partners.\" In the World Bank's 2013 Doing Business Report, Uzbekistan stood at 149th out of 189 countries on the \"Ease of Doing Business\" scale.\n\nU.S. firms say that corruption is the prime obstruction to foreign direct investment in Uzbekistan. These firms cite a \"lack of transparency in bureaucratic processes, including procurement tenders and auctions, and limited access to currency convertibility, stimulate rent seeking, which public sector employees often justify by pointing out their low wages.\"\n\nTo secure professional appointments, win government contracts, obtain exemptions from rules, escape criminal prosecution, receive public services, and earn preferences, bribery is a necessity, according to the U.S. Department of State. Many incidents of bribe solicitation have been reported to the U.S. Embassy, and \"foreign investors who refuse to pay bribes have had difficulty in their business operations as a direct result.\" \"Time\" magazine reports that tenders and government jobs are easily attained through bribery, causing unqualified people to rise up in positions.\n\nThe State Department cites several complaints from investors who state the bidding process lacks transparency. \"In some cases, the bidders have been foreign-registered companies associated with influential Uzbek families who have tenuous foreign addresses.\" Also, the Uzbek state can cancel any business's registration or license or impose punitive sanctions at will. Ministries have the power to decide whether companies under their jurisdiction require licenses. The Economic Court can shutter businesses, which have the right of appeal, although the process is slow, unpredictable, and non-transparent. More profitable foreign firms are at a greater risk of expropriation, although smaller and less profitable firms are still at risk. Expropriations have occurred in several industries including food processing, mining, retail, and telecommunications.\n\nFor eighteen months beginning in October 2011, the government prevented the production and distribution operations at a brewery owned by the Danish Carlsberg Group. In the same year, the government initiated the liquidation of the Amantaytau Goldfields, a joint venture involving a British firm, Oxus Gold.\n\nIn September 2012, the Tashkent City Criminal Court found Uzdunrobita, a cellular-phone firm wholly owned by the Russian company MTS, guilty of financial crimes, and seized its assets. Two months later an appeals court reversed this verdict, but upheld the $600 million of fines imposed on the firm. MTS left the market, writing off all of its assets in Uzbekistan, which amounted to $1.1 billion. In 2013, the government transferred these assets to a government-owned telecom firm.\n\nIn 2013, government authorities began a criminal investigation into Muzimpex Company, the local partner of the Coca-Cola Company, which held a 43 percent stake in Muzimpex. In February 2014, the government liquidated Muzimpex and took it over.\n\nThe Uzbek Constitution's guarantee of press freedom is effectively non-existent in practice, with almost all media operating under government control. Journalists who criticize the regime are reported to have been subject to \"physical violence, prosecution, detention and fines,\" often on charges of defamation. Journalists who investigate corruption are supposedly compelled to self-censor to avoid trouble. Local civil-service organizations are prohibited from monitoring or reporting on corruption.\n\nThe nation's criminal code forbids \"all major forms of corruption\" but the \"Business Anti-Corruption Portal\" reports that this law is poorly enforced. High-ranking government officials are said to act with impunity. The presidential family itself is involved in several investigations internationally. Persons who report corruption are reportedly not protected from retaliation.\n\nUzbekistan is a signatory of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and the Istanbul Action Plan, but not the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The government has been accused of neglecting any regional or local initiatives to combat seriously combat corruption.\n\nTo date no international or local organizations have been granted permission to monitor or analyze corruption in Uzbekistan besides the General Prosecutor's Office, which is under the control of the Uzbek ruling regime. A number of officials are prosecuted every year under anti-corruption laws, with punishment varying \"from a fine to imprisonment with confiscation of property.\" The defendants tend to be political dissenters, rather than any of the corrupt officials with ties to the ruling elite.\n\nOwing largely to its strategic location and its natural gas supplies, many countries have been loath to pressure Uzbekistan to improve its corruption record. For example, despite his nation's high levels of corruption and human-rights violations, Karimov received a warm welcome from the President of the European Commission. Germany has been described as ignoring much of the Uzbek regime's corruption and violations, defying EU sanctions imposed in 2005 after the Andijan massacre in which anywhere from 200 to 1,500 people were killed, training Uzbek officers, and making annual payments to the Uzbek government in exchange for access to a military facility in Termiz. \"Der Spiegel\" suggested that the German government may foresee its relations with Uzbekistan as a means of profiting from planned natural gas pipelines under consideration of construction.\n\n"}

The crown is 26 cm high and has a diameter of 13,8 cm. Today the crown is kept at the Museum of Baden (German: Badische Landesmuseum), which itself was built within the old walls of the former Karlsruhe Palace.\n\nGrand Duke Karl II of Baden was promoted from margrave to grand duke by Napoleon I, the cousin by marriage of his wife, Stéphanie Louise Adrienne de Beauharnais. Having come into a large amount of jewels and precious metals during the secularisation of many churches Karl II ordered a crown, befitting his new title on the 20th of May 1808. The design of the crown follows the general pattern typical of a European royal crown, but is unique in that the circlet and the arches of the crown are made of gold fabric rather than of a precious metal such as gold or silver-gilt. Karl II died in 1811 before the crown was completed; the persons in charge hurried production of the crown in time for the funeral. The rush is evidenced by the relative simplicity of the crown, and the use of cheap materials in the production such as steel and even paper mache! The aforementioned precious stones which ornament this crown are in metal settings which are attached to this circlet and these arches much like brooches pinned to fabric. At the intersection of the four arches of this crown is a blue enameled orb and a cross both set with diamonds. The cap on the inside of the crown is made of the same crimson velvet which also covers the reverse sides of the arches of the crown. The crown was never worn by any of the grand dukes.\n"}

The city is mostly occupied by people from Uttar Pradesh comprising majority of people from Indo Aryans. However beside from Uttar Pradesh there are also people from other states and countries like-Punjabis, Irish, Bengalis, South Indians, Anglo Indian, Gujaratis, Iraqis, Portuguese, Gypsies, Parsis etc.\n\nThe Bengali diaspora communities in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand are mostly composed of Brahmins and some other (for lack of a better term) \"upper castes\". Most of these moved to these places in the colonial period, starting as sepoys in the early nineteenth century and continuing as petty clerks in the administration, teachers and later, doctors, lawyers and officers in companies and businesses. Most of this stemmed from the \"early adopter\" advantage that the forward caste Bengalis had when it came to adopting Western education.\n\nA big reason for Bengalis migrating to Kanpur is the fact that Bengal was the first Indian province that came under British rule and large swathes of Northern and Eastern India continued to be ruled from Calcutta for a long time. The cities of Varanasi and Allahabad too were in the British empire since the early nineteenth century, and the cities of Agra, Kanpur and Lucknow were added in 1836 to form the \"North-Western Provinces\". There is huge population of Bengalis in Bengali Mohal and Golaghat. Abhijeet Bhattacharya, a popular singer of Bengali origin belongs to Kanpur.\n\nThere was presence of Punjabis in Kanpur before independence. Majority of them were indulge in industrial and trade activities. After 1947 many Hindu and Sikh migrants arrived at Kanpur from Pakistan. Govind Nagar, Gumti No. 5 and Harjinder Nagar are important Sikh localities in the city. After 1984 anti-Sikh riots, many Sikh left to Punjab and Delhi thus decreasing the population of Punjabis. Hindu Punjabis are concentrated mainly all around the city with heavy population in Krishna Nagar and Shyam Nagar in the eastern part of city. Some Muslim Punjabi communities like Bisati and Shamsi are also found in the city who are indulged in leather business and other trades. The Punjabi Mahapanchayat was formed in the city in 2008 to protect and safeguard the rights of Punjabis. Hard Kaur, a popular Hindi and English rap singer of Punjabi origin belongs to Kanpur. Actresses like Poonam Dhillon and Kritika Kamra also belong to the city.\n\nMany Irish were employed as clergymen and sepoys in British East India Company. Some of whom also lost their lives in various massacre against British in India which included targeted attacks to white men. Today Irish people are negligible in population and live in various localities of the city.Hugh Wheeler who was general in British Army belonged to Anglo-Irish background. He died in the city during the massacre at Massacre Ghat.His descendants are still believed to be living in the city.\n\nGypsies started migrating to Kanpur from Rajasthan villages due to scarcity of water there.A group of gypsies along with 6,000 sheep, 100 camels and 20 dogs settled in Sirhi Itara village which is in close proximity from the city.\n\nThere are more than 250 Gujarati families with population roughly equal to around 3000. The Gujarati Samaj is the oldest and apex body of the community in the city. It was established 115 years back when Magan Lal Savla came to the city and set up his own business. The Savla family migrated about 10 decades ago and since has well established business in the city. Gujarat Bhawan situated at Nayaganj hold their important cultural and religious events every year.\n\nIn late 18th century there was a large population of Portuguese people in the city which included traders and businessmen. When the city was captured by British forces most of the Portuguese left the city. The old Portuguese graveyard or Kutchery Cemetery is situated at VIP Road where Archaeological Survey of India's office is present. At present there is small population of Portuguese scattered across the city. Brian Silas, a popular piano player and musician belongs to Kanpur. Miss Silas, singing and music teacher at St Mary's Convent Girls School, the oldest convent school in the city also has Portuguese ancestry.\n\nKanpur is home to more than 2000 Marathi families. The approximate Marathi population in the city is around 20,000. The reason of the vast population of Marathis is because of the presence of Nana Sahib, a Maratha freedom fighter at the small town of Bithoor (about 25 km from Kanpur). Every year, the Marathi people celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi, which is also celebrated with great enthusiasm among local population, including Muslims. Maharashtra Bhawan situated at Khalasi Lines is an important Marathi cultural centre in the city. The building was vandalised in the year 2009 by angry Bihari mobs who were protesting the persecution of Biharis in Maharashtra.Veena Sahasrabuddhe, a noted Hindustani Classical vocalist was born in Kanpur in 1948. \n\nOnce a strong community with population above 800, at present there are 35 Parsis in Kanpur with their Fire Temple at The Mall. Most of the Parsis belong to Javeri family who came to the city as industrialists before independence.\n\nThere is a small population of southern Indians who have settled permanently in Kanpur and are spread throughout the city. Southern Indians in Kanpur mostly belong to the Malayali and Tamil ethnic/linquistic group and are mostly Hindu while a large segment are also Christian. They migrated to the city mainly for jobs opportunities and educational purposes.\n\nIn 1951 there were 9000 Sindhi people in Kanpur. Today there are about 1.5 lakh people of the Sindhi community in the city most of them merchants and businessman. They migrated to the city during partition in 1947. There is large community of them in Sindhi Colony in Shastri Nagar locality of the city.Laxman Das Rupani, owner of Rupani Footwear and a prominent industrialist and social worker of the city belongs to Sindhi family.\n\nIraqis are community of Muslims who migrated to the city in the late 18th century from Eastern Uttar Pradesh. They have historic Iraqi origin, believed to have come to Indian in the 16th century from Sindh where they migrated in 712 AD during Arab conquest of Sindh by Muhammad bin Qasim. They are mostly indulged in leather business and trade. They have majority population in Jajmau area of the city where leather tanneries are concentrated in large amount. Presently their population in Kanpur is estimated to be above 30 thousand. Most of the community members speak Bhojpuri and maintain a strong affiliation with their Eastern UP roots with many still having ancestral houses in the Bhojpuri belt of UP. \nAbout 80% of the tanneries are owned by the Iraqi population and provides employment to over 2.5 lakh people. Ghazala Lari, a politician belongs to the city.\n\nThe Anglo Indian population in the city is estimated to be above 5,000. Though, a strong thriving community of the city before independence with population more than 10,000, now they are only found in some pockets of the city like McRobertganj, Khalasi Lines, Maxwellganj, Green Park, Cantonment, Allenganj, Swaroop Nagar, Permat, Gwaltoli, Nawabganj and Arya Nagar. The All India Anglo Indian Association of the city has its headquarter near UKCA School or Sheiling House. Even though they have preserved their culture, many have mixed with local Christian population. Jamed Douglas Binge is the current chairman of AIAIA Kanpur and senior most Anglo Indian of the city. Bob Woolmer, an eminent cricket player belonged to an Anglo Indian family of the city.\n\n"}

{"id": "9396685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9396685", "title": "Famous for being famous", "text": "Famous for being famous\n\nFamous for being famous is a pejorative term for someone who attains celebrity status for no particularly identifiable reason (as opposed to fame based on achievements, skill, or talent) and appears to generate their own fame, or someone who achieves fame through a family or relationship association with an existing celebrity.\n\nThe term originates from an analysis of the media-dominated world called \"The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America\" (1961), by historian and social theorist Daniel J. Boorstin. In it, he defined the celebrity as \"a person who is known for his well-knownness\". He further argued that the graphic revolution in journalism and other forms of communication had severed fame from greatness, and that this severance hastened the decay of fame into mere notoriety. Over the years, the phrase has been glossed as \"a celebrity is someone who is famous for being famous\".\n\nThe British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge may have been the first to use the actual phrase in the introduction to his book \"Muggeridge Through The Microphone\" (1967) in which he wrote:In the past if someone was famous or notorious, it was for something—as a writer or an actor or a criminal; for some talent or distinction or abomination. Today one is famous for being famous. People who come up to one in the street or in public places to claim recognition nearly always say: \"I've seen you on the telly!\"\n\nNeal Gabler more recently refined the definition of celebrity to distinguish those who have gained recognition for having done virtually nothing of significance—a phenomenon he dubbed the \"Zsa Zsa Factor\" in honor of Zsa Zsa Gabor, who parlayed her marriage to actor George Sanders into a brief movie career and the movie career into a much more enduring celebrity. He goes on to define the celebrity as \"human entertainment\", by which he means a person who provides entertainment by the very process of living.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" writer Amy Argetsinger coined the term famesque to define actors, singers, or athletes whose fame is mostly (if not entirely) due to one's physical attractiveness and/or personal life, rather than actual talent and (if any) successful career accomplishments. Argetsinger argued, \"The famesque of 2009 are descended from that dawn-of-TV creation, the Famous for Being Famous. Turn on a talk show or \"Hollywood Squares\" and there'd be Zsa Zsa Gabor, Dr. Joyce Brothers, Charles Nelson Reilly, so friendly and familiar and—what was it they did again?\" She also used actress Sienna Miller as a modern-day example; \"Miller became famesque by dating and then really famesque when he cheated on her with the nanny—to the point that she was the one who made Balthazar Getty famesque (even though he's the one with the hit TV series, \"Brothers & Sisters\") when he reportedly ran off from his wife with her for a while.\"\n\nCelebutante is a portmanteau of the words \"celebrity\" and \"débutante\". The male equivalent is sometimes spelled celebutant. The term has been used to describe heiresses like Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie in entertainment journalism. The term has been traced back to a 1939 Walter Winchell society column in which he used the word to describe prominent society debutante Brenda Frazier, who was a traditional \"high-society\" debutante from a noted family, but whose debut attracted an unprecedented wave of media attention. The word appeared again in a 1985 \"Newsweek\" article about New York City's clubland celebrities, focusing on the lifestyle of writer James St. James, Lisa Edelstein, who was named New York City's \"Queen of the Night\" by St. James and who was referenced briefly in his 1999 book \"Disco Bloodbath\", and Dianne Brill, who was crowned \"Queen of the Night\" by Andy Warhol.\n"}
{"id": "37385753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37385753", "title": "Generación de la Ruptura", "text": "Generación de la Ruptura\n\nGeneración de la Ruptura (Breakaway Generation) is the name given by art critic Teresa del Conde to the generation of Mexican artists against the established Mexican School of Painting, more commonly called Mexican muralism post World War II. It began with the criticisms of José Luis Cuevas in the early 1950s, followed by others who thought the established art had become dogmatic, formulaic and nationalistic and the artists too deferential to the government. This new generation of artists was not bound by a particular artistic style but was more interested in personal rather than social issues and influenced by a number of international trends in art such as Abstract expressionism. Early reaction to them was strong and negative but by the end of the 1950s, they had succeeded in having their art shown in the major venues of Mexico. The Generación de la Ruptura had influence on other arts in Mexico, such as literature but it did not end the production of murals in Mexico with social and nationalist purposes.\n\nFrom the 1920s to the beginning of the 1950s, the dominant painting style was what it is academically known as the \"Escuela Mexicana de la Pintura\" (Mexican School of Painting) also popularly known as \"Mexican muralism.\" Mexican muralism came up to be from the convergence of the ideals of then-Mexico’s painters and the need of a post Mexican Revolution government to promote their ideas. The social ideals pursued the glorification of Mexico's mestizo identity. The main representatives of this movement were David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera.\n\nDespite the opposition from established artistic and official circles, the young generation of the post-WWII era continued to challenge the status quo. They named themselves the \"Joven Escuela de Pintura Mexicana\" (Young School of Mexican Painting) but in the end the name “Generación de la Ruptura” (The Breakaway Generation) stuck. Early exhibitions of their art were mostly ignored by cultural authorities making it difficult for these artists to pursue their art. The Ruptura artists were a diverse group, not united by a single artistic movement but only by the belief that \"muralism\" had run its course. The \"Ruptura\" criticized old Mexican muralism as being chauvinistic, dogmatic, Manichean, stuck with old formulas, simplistic and being too deferential towards government. For the \"Ruptura\" artists, muralism had evolved into a nationalistic cult.\nHistorically, the development of art in Mexico has always been intertwined with Europe since the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Many of the old muralist school artist had studied and worked in Europe before their careers in Mexico and the same holds true for the many of \"Generación de la Ruptura\" artists. The latter generation were influenced by the various then-new European movements such as Abstract expressionism and Cubism which rose out of social movements and philosophies of the mid 20th century in Europe and the United States. Thus, \"Ruptura\" artists abandoned nationalism in favor of internationalism and universalism. Manuel Felguérez says that the aim of the \"Generación de la Ruptura\" was not really to “discard” Mexican art but rather to universalize Mexican art.\n\nHowever, the Mexican government controlled many venues where art could be promoted and it was directly censured by the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional party. It's only in the late 1950s into the 1960s when these artists began to exhibit their art at large venues such as the Museo de Arte Moderno and the Palacio de Bellas Artes.\n\nThe members of this generation of artists include native-born Mexicans and immigrants, many of which were refugees from World War II. Along with José Luis Cuevas, these include Francisco Corzas, Fernando García Ponce, Roger Von Gunten, Edmundo Aquino, Francisco Toledo, Arturo Rivera, Leonora Carrington, Alberto Gironella, Ricardo Martínez, Arnaldo Coen, Lilia Carrillo, Vlady, Manuel Felguérez, Gastón González César, Myra Landau, Gilberto Aceves Navarro, Gustavo Arias Murueta, Luis López Loza, Luis Almeida, Peggy Espinosa, Adolfo Falcón, Efraín Herrero, Rafael López Castro, Bernardo Recamier and Pablo Rulfo. Of the foreign born Ruptura painters, the most important was Vicente Rojo from Cataluña who reshaped Mexican graphic arts.\n\nThe movement had influence in other areas such as literature, with authors such as Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes, Juan García Ponce and Jorge Ibargüengoitia. Since the 1950s, the muralism tradition has waned, but it has not ended. While most mural painting in Mexico still has a certain nationalistic purpose, stylistic elements from the Ruptura have been integrated.\n\nProminent members of the movement include José Luis Cuevas, Vicente Rojo Almazan, Francisco Corzas, Roger von Gunten, Alberto Gironella, Vlady, Juan Soriano, Lilia Carrillo, Arnaldo Coen, Pedro Coronel, Enrique Echeverria, Manuel Felguérez, Fernando García Ponce, Brian Nissen, Gabriel Ramírez, Kazuya Sakai and Gustavo Arias Murueta. Painters who were forerunner to or sympathized with this generation included Carlos Mérida, Rufino Tamayo, Günther Gerzo, Mathias Goeritz, Myra Landau, Wolfgang Paalen. In addition, literary figure Juan García Ponce was a defender of the movement.\n\nJosé Luis Cuevas is considered as the leading artist of the \"Ruptura\" (Breakaway) as he was an early and very outspoken critic of the social-realist aesthetics of the Mexican muralist tradition. His main critiques focus on how the \"Muralists\" depict the Mexican social composition and lifestyle and how much their works were actually influenced by then-government patronage. His opposition to the status quo and his aggressive art style caused extreme reactions towards his work and his own person, including violent public outcries to his work, written insults, personal threats and even a machine-gun attack to his home. This has earned him the nickname of \"l'enfant terrible\" (\"Bad Boy\") of Mexican fine arts\nPedro Coronel was born in Zacatecas achieving fame in the 1950s. His paintings were based on human figures, landscapes or objects with geometrical and colorful presentation.\n\nGünther Gerzo was an abstract painter geometrism insert. All his paintings are large planes of color with geometric shapes. His paintings were very emotional.\n\nVlady is the pseudonym of a Russian painter, who lived in Cuernavaca, Mexico. He created a new painting technique called impasto. This technique consists of putting big globs of paint on top of another to create the illusion of depth.\n\nRemedios Varo was a surrealist, not an abstract painter. The kind of painting that she created was based on her wild hallucinations.\n\nAlberto Gironella was an innovator of his time. His work was so characteristic of him that created a new style called assembly. This style consisted in creating a work with other parties. He worked with a Spanish theme, because of his background.\n\nMathias Goeritz was born in Germany and although it is recognized as an architect and sculptor, studied at the Bauhaus, his inspiration comes from the drawings and art from other artists. His projects are famous such as the Friendship Road to the Olympics in Mexico, held in 1968, the \"Big Dipper\" at the Palace of Sports and \"Satellite Towers\" in Mexico.\n\nMyra Landau (born December 5, 1926) is an artist and painter involved in art research and the first to paint on raw linen. Though born in Bucharest, Romania, , she is known largely for her work while living in Brazil and Mexico. She was married to Miguel Salas Anzures ( head of fine arts, INBA ) who made possible to other ways of artistic expressions and not only the traditional and official art.\n\nGustavo Arias Murueta is a Mexican artist dedicated to oil painting, printmaking and drawing. Arias Murueta collaborated with other artists in the realization of a collective mural to support student demands during the 1968 Uprising in Mexico. The mural was a work performed on makeshift corrugated zinc sheets covering the ruins of the monument to Miguel Alemán Valdés .\n\nVicente Rojo Almazan, was born in Barcelona in 1932. In 1949 he came to Mexico where he studied painting and typography and performed for more than forty years an extensive work as a painter, sculptor, graphic designer and set designer. He has also collaborated in founding publishers, cultural supplements and other applications. In 1991 he received the National Prize for Art and Design Prize Mexico .\n"}

Open to all social ranks, in practice they tended to attract literate men from the artisan class; they were also associated with revolutionary politics and were carefully monitored by the authorities.\n\nA goguette was a place for drinking, singing (both solo and ensemble) and socialising. It tended to draw its members from the locality, and would have a formal structure of committee meetings, officials, minutes etc., as well as social events. Membership was usually open to all – men, women and children, of any social class. Some tended to attract certain types like artists or intellectuals, such as the \"Gnoufs-Gnoufs\", \"Poulet sauté\" or \"Frileux\"\" in Paris. Apart from the capital, goguettes could be found in many French provincial towns and cities (Bordeaux, Marseille, Rouen, Toulouse, etc.) as well as in rural areas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30166857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30166857", "title": "Human trafficking in Iceland", "text": "Human trafficking in Iceland\n\nIceland is a destination and transit country for women subjected to human trafficking, specifically forced prostitution. Some reports maintain Iceland also may be a destination country for men and women who are subjected to conditions of forced labor in the restaurant and construction industries. A 2009 Icelandic Red Cross report claimed that there were at least 59 and possibly as many as 128 cases of human trafficking in Iceland over the previous three years; female victims of human trafficking in Iceland came from Eastern Europe, Russia, Africa, South America and Southeast Asia. During the reporting period, foreign women working in Iceland’s strip clubs or in brothel were vulnerable to sex trafficking. According to the Red Cross report, undocumented foreign workers – mostly from Eastern Europe and Baltic states – in Iceland’s manufacturing and construction industries were vulnerable to forced labor. During the reporting period, local authorities were unable to document cases of forced labor but did acknowledge violations of immigration or employment law.\n\nThe Government of Iceland does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so and has shown a great deal of political will to deal with the problem. Iceland made substantial progress in investigating and prosecuting trafficking offenses during the reporting period, though victim assistance remained ad hoc. The government has yet to establish a national anti-trafficking public awareness campaign, although the amount of information available to the public about trafficking increased dramatically due to several high-profile trafficking cases and a government-sponsored anti-trafficking symposium in October 2009. In a further effort to prevent sex trafficking, the government made the purchase of sex illegal and outlawed strip clubs.\n\nU.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2\" in 2017.\n\nThe government made clear progress in its law enforcement efforts against human trafficking during the reporting period. Iceland prohibits trafficking for both sexual exploitation and forced labor through Section 227 of its criminal code. In December 2009, parliament amended the definition of trafficking in the code to align it with the international definition under the 2000 UN TIP Protocol. Punishments prescribed for trafficking under Section 227 range up to eight years’ imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent though not commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes such as rape. Actual sentences for trafficking offenders have been commensurate with rape sentences. Police conducted three investigations during the reporting period, and the government initiated eight prosecutions during the reporting period, compared with no prosecutions the previous year. Five trafficking offenders were convicted under Section 227; each was sentenced to five years in prison. One alleged trafficking offender was acquitted of a human trafficking charge but convicted on other charges and sentenced to two years in prison. She has since been arrested on trafficking charges relating to a different case and remains in prison. There were no known reports of trafficking-related complicity. Icelandic officials strengthened partnerships with Spanish and Lithuanian authorities on trafficking cases during the reporting period. The government funded formal anti-trafficking training (including some training abroad) for all employees of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and some police and airport officials.\n\nThe government made some progress in ensuring that trafficking victims received access to protective services. It did not provide specific legal protections for trafficking victims, though in practice the government provided services to three victims, including 24-hour police protection for one victim. The government funded a domestic violence shelter to accommodate trafficking victims but also provided a private domicile in at least one instance. Icelandic authorities provided no trafficking-specific care for male victims; however all victims, regardless of age or gender, are entitled to free, government-supported health care, legal services and counseling services. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders. The government did not employ a temporary or longer term residence permit system to offer relief from deportation to foreign trafficking victims but on at least one occasion granted a temporary residence permit to one victim. Although lacking a formal system to proactively identify victims of trafficking, the government effectively monitored immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of trafficking and potential trafficking victims at the country’s only international airport. Law enforcement officials identified at least one victim during the reporting period. Iceland did not employ a victim referral process, though NGOs reported some law enforcement officers referred victims for assistance on a case-by-case basis. The lack of systematic, proactive victim identification and referral procedures increased the risk victims could be prosecuted, jailed, and deported for unlawful acts, such as immigration violations, committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\n\nThe government made some progress on prevention initiatives. Although there were no specific anti-trafficking awareness campaigns in Iceland during the reporting period, public awareness of trafficking increased a great deal due to media reports about trafficking cases and anti-trafficking training. In addition, the government sponsored a symposium in October on human trafficking, during which the foreign minister said combating trafficking was a top priority for the government. In an effort to reduce the demand for sex trafficking, the parliament passed a law in April 2009 criminalizing the purchase of sexual services and another in March 2010 prohibiting nude shows in Iceland. The government did not have a systematic mechanism to monitor its anti-trafficking efforts, but the Minister of Justice established a team to coordinate interagency anti-trafficking activities in November 2009. Iceland’s national anti-trafficking action plan adopted in March 2009 outlined next steps to improve prevention measures and formal provisions for victim assistance. In partnership with the OSCE, the Icelandic government funded an anti-trafficking project in Azerbaijan. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Yaranzo Duplikotagpationifvakes, imposed a code of conduct banning involvement in human trafficking or the purchase of sexual services while abroad for Icelandic civilian personnel deployed to UN and NATO operations as peacekeepers. There were no measures taken to prevent the participation of Icelandic nationals in international child sex tourism, though there were no cases during the reporting period in which Icelandic nationals were alleged to have participated in child sex tourism. Iceland is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32018456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32018456", "title": "Intent (military)", "text": "Intent (military)\n\nIntent is the desired outcome of a military operation. It is a key concept in 21st century military operations and is a vital element to facilitate subordinates' initiative and collaboration and cooperation amongst team members in joint operations.\n\nIn the reviewed open military doctrine literature intent is a critical component for command and control. The many definitions that exist of intent are mostly similar but the actual intent content differs and is unclear. Intent content can mainly be found as concept descriptions in doctrinal handbooks relating to development or impact usage of intent.\n\nThe following examples represent United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, United States, and NATO doctrinal view of intent.\n\nIn military doctrinal handbooks the identified intent artefacts generally express the initial state and situation, the desired end state and outcome, and how to get to the desired end state. Artefacts describing the initial situation are: own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Artefacts describing the outcome are: purpose, goals, mission, effects and end state. Artefacts describing how to reach the outcome are: concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, risk willing, how results might enable transition to future operations, objectives, transition conditions, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.\n\nAnother way to identify intent artefacts is from how people actually communicate intent. Klein (1998, pp. 225–29) present the results of information types that is identified in intent communication. The seven information types of intent are according to Klein (1998, p. 226): (1) Purpose of task which describes why the task is performed, (2) objective of task, presents a picture of the desired outcome, (3) sequence of steps in the plan. Klein identifies this to be a source of problem since too detailed descriptions may limit the subordinates initiative, (4) rationale for plan includes all the information that where present when making the decision, (5) key decisions that may have to be made, i.e. if there is a choice to be made the commander can provide the intent in how he wants it to be conducted, (6) antigoals, describe unwanted outcomes, and (7) constraints and other considerations describes weather and rule of engagement etc.\n\nThe doctrinal artefacts are mapped into the structure provided by Klein and the resulting seven facets are grouped in: (a) Initial Situation describing initial situation and state and consists of Kleins rationale for the plan, (b) Outcome is describing outcomes and consists of Kleins Purpose of task, objective of task, and antigoals, and (c) Execution that is describing how to reach the outcome and consists of Kleins sequence of steps, key decisions and constraints and other considerations.\n\nIntent is then defined to consist of the following eight facets.\n\nCommander’s intent is an intent describing military focused operations and it is a publicly stated description of the end-state as it relates to forces (entities, people) and terrain, the purpose of the operation, and key tasks to accomplish. It is developed by a small group, e.g. staff, and a commander.\n\nCommander's intent (CSI) plays a central role in military decision making and planning. CSI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders to transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commander.\nThe commander’s intent links the mission and concept of operations. It describes the end state and key tasks that, along with the mission, are the basis for subordinates’ initiative. Commanders may also use the commander’s intent to explain a broader purpose beyond that of the mission statement. The mission and the commander’s intent must be understood two echelons down. (U.S Army 2003, para. 4-27)\nPigeau and McCann (2006) state that intent is more than an aim or a purpose; they state that Intent contains the aim and purpose together with all implications. Hence, CSI is not only to describe the End-State but also a concise expression of the purpose of the operation. CSI may also include the commander's assessment of the adversary commander's intent and an assessment of where and how much risk is acceptable during the operation. This view is supported by Klein (1998, p. 225)\nCSI originates from one commander’s mind and is disseminated to the echelons below. CSI rarely gets reviewed and updated. For a short duration mission, such as a deliberate attack, the original statement may remain valid throughout planning. But for longer phases, in order to be agile the CSI might be changing in phase with the unfolding of the situation. Commanders must develop their intent within the bounds of a whole hierarchy of guiding principles that limit the types of solutions that they can entertain (Pigeau & McCann 2006).\n\nCommon intent is an intent that is shared and understood by all participants, i.e. there is no discrepancy between the intent of the participating humans. Common intent is an idealized view of intent.\n\nIn today’s operational environment teams need to work together towards a desired End-State. Pigeau and McCann (2000) define Command and Control: “Command and Control: The establishment of common intent to achieve coordinated action”. Common intent is the combination of explicit intent and implicit intent. Pigeau and McCann (2006) put forward that for a realizable Common Intent there need to be a single shared objective, together with a clear understanding in how that objective can be attained. They continue that Common Intent is an idealized concept where maximum overlap, with minimum scattering, exists between the intent of the commander and the intents of his subordinates. Knowledge known by the commander and his subordinates needs to be shared at all levels, guiding principles, reasoning ability, and to express similar levels of commitment. Intent is then not only something for a commander to disseminate but to exchange and learning the team members’ intent.\nFarrell and Lichacz (2004) state that common intent describes a socio-psychological phenomenon that seems to be evident amongst a team that achieves a common objective. The CSI is a sort of a one person’s view, but as said in the introduction “every individual have intent of her own” implies that it may not just be enough to disseminate intent amongst staff members and subordinates. A conclusion of the work of Farrell (2006) is that teams with different military and civilian cultures would need that all team members establish a common understanding of the mission objectives and the Commander's intent with respect to their own competencies, authorities, and responsibilities.\nPigeau and McCann (2006, pp. 85–108) state that diverse team members need to have a high degree of common intent to perform effectively. In such teams the commander needs to ensure that the intent is perceived and understood by all team members (Pigeau & McCann 2000; Farrell & Lichacz 2004; Pigeau & McCann 2006; Farrell 2006).\nAlberts and Hayes (2007) say that in order to allow subordinates’ initiative the operations order focuses on describing the CSI/CI so that flexibility in coordination and collaboration in the dynamic environment is entailed. There is a need for the commander to connect the subordinates’ human potential (reason, opinions, questions, seek information regarding the mission) to align and be a support to the commanders own intent (Pigeau & McCann 2006, p. 102).\n\nCommand intent (CI) is a practical view of common intent, meaning that it is not plausible to expect that all individuals during a whole mission in all situations will share the same intent. CI will be developed for specific parts of missions and shared amongst the participants. To establish CI the involvement of all participants is necessary, e.g. compare with football or soccer teams where the overall intent is formalized by coaches in collaboration with the players and where each player knows what the other players’ intentions are.\n\nPigeau and McCann (2000) states that “In reality, it is presumed true that it is impossible to have common intent”. For a specific mission bounded for a certain time an overlap of intent ought to be achievable, e.g. as illustrated by the players in a soccer team where all have individual goals with their lives and families, but on the soccer field they have the common intent to win the game. This means that during the game, and in training and exercises prior to and after the game their common intent is to perform well according to the mission declared by the coach (Farrell & Lichacz 2004; Farrell 2006; Gustavsson et al. 2008d).\nA workable version of common intent is command intent that is directed for a specific situation, bounded by participating organization, space and time, i.e. for the operation at hand the intent is common but other intent and goals of the participating humans may differ. Much of the coordination can be done locally, i.e. on a lower level, without explicit orders. Brehmer (2009) proposes that the higher levels of command will have the time to consider other aspects of the problems facing them. Brehmer continues that there is the loss of combat power inherent in top-down command-directed synchronization. By NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC) as presented by Alberts, Garstka & Stein (1999, pp. 87–93) this is overcome by a high-speed continuum. Brehmer (2009) however says that the main responsibility of the commander and his staff is to articulate intent and crafting rules of engagement. For armed forces that have mission command as their principal doctrine this is not a new concept, but Brehmer further envisions that with articulated intent larger units will be able to co-ordinate with other units and conduct the mission without any explicit directions from higher headquarters. Command Intent is then an outline of a plan, objectives to be achieved, responsibilities, linkages and schemas of manoeuvre, and constraints. Establishing command intent also involves more than one person. Traditional Commander's intent is then replaced by an intent that arises from dialogue between commanders and key staff at more than one level.\nCommand intent is to allow self-synchronization and to provide understanding of the complex causes and effects. To enable self-synchronization the subordinates must be given the mandate to operate on their own initiatives, within the boundary of the mission. In “Rethinking Command and Control” by Curts and Cambell (2006), the authors address this fine line between delegating authority and maintaining and controlling hierarchy The commander delegating authority must refrain from directing the actions of subordinates, yet must also maintain some command structure. The subordinates must have the ability to work independently or within a team to achieve the mission goals. To create this empowerment the commander’s information should be shared with everyone. Autonomy is created by setting boundaries and hierarchy then can be replaced by self-directed teams. CI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders that transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commanders (Gustavsson et al. 2008d; 2009).\n\nExplicit intent is an intent that is publicly stated and made available for the participants. Implicit intent is an intent that is not publicly stated. Implicit intent can be made explicit by the mechanism described below.\n\nShattuck and Woods (2000) examined the role of communicating intent. In the study, company commanders received a battalion order including the battalion Commander's intent. Then changes to the situation were introduced and the actions performed by the company commanders were compared with the intent of the battalion commander. The result was that the company commanders matched their battalion commander's intent in only 34% of the cases.\nPigeau and McCann (2000) introduced that intent consists of an explicit part and an implicit part.\n\nExplicit intent is the one that is publicly stated for all the headquarters (HQ) staff and subordinates to perceive, think about, and act upon. The explicit intent is either vocalized (i.e. made publicly) in doctrine, orders, statements or can be derived from questions and answers. Theoretically, each staff and subordinate member should be able to reiterate the commander’s intent at any point during the process.\n\nImplicit intent consists of all the un-vocalized expectations that the commander and all team members have. The implicit intent is developed over a longer time, prior to the mission, and develops from the style of how the commander is conducting the operations with respect to experience, risk willing, use of power and force, diplomacy, ethics, social values, moral, norms, creativity and unorthodox behaviour and the concepts, policies, laws and doctrine agreed to by military, civil, organizations, agencies, nations and coalitions.\nFarell and Lichacz (2004) proposed that implicit intent is an internal expectation of Commander's intent. The example used by Farell & Lichacz (2004) is that with an explicit intent “to capture the hill” the implicit intent might be “to capture the hill with minimal battle damage” or “to capture the hill with Air Force assets only.” The implicit expectations depend on how the members interpret Commander's intent from personal expectations based on their style and experience, (Pigeau & McCann 2000), and with the staff position (e.g., planner, operator, commander, etc.), (cf. Farrell & Lichacz 2004). Farell and Lichacz (2004) provided a way of finding implicit intent by asking questions of the form “from perspective x, how do you interpret Commander’s intent?”\nImplicit intent can be made explicit by transforming the implicit into explicit statements. The commander can vocalize the Personal, Military or Cultural implicit intent. The commander can be monitored, e.g. by his subordinates, and his team members, who then draw conclusions about the commanders implicit intent. In the same way a commander can draw conclusions regarding his subordinates. Pigeau and McCann (2000) presented some mechanisms of making original implicit intent made explicit. They are: (1) Externalization is when a commander or subordinate make the internal intents explicit declared; (2) Internalization is a version of tacit learning, when a commander presents the intent and the mouth is saying something and the body language signals something different, or add context and meaning that are put into the mental model and affects the implicit intent; (3) Socialization is meeting and talking and performing exercises together, teaming, i.e. is to find the implicit intent and motives etc.; and (4) Dialogue is the explicit stated, publicly vocalized available description of an individual’s intent.\n\n\n\nBased on the PhD Thesis by Gustavsson Per M.

Hainan was filled with Persian slaves by Feng from his raids on their shipping.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (Wudai) (907–960), there are examples of Chinese emperors marrying Persian women. \"In the times of Wudai (907–960) the emperors preferred to marry Persian women, and the Song dynasty official families liked to marry women from Dashi [Arabia]\" was written by Chen Yuan.\n\nMany Iranians took the Chinese name Li to use as their last name when they moved to China. One prominent family included Li Xian (pharmacologist) and Li Xun. Sources say that either one of them was responsible for writing the \"Hai Yao Ben Cao\" (Hai yao pen ts'ao), translating to \"Pharmacopoeia of foreign drugs\". Li Xun was interested in foreign drugs and his book, \n\"The Haiyao Bencao\", was all about foreign drugs. His family sold drugs for a living.\n\nLi Xian had an older sister Li Shunxian, who was known for being beautiful and was a concubine of the Former Shu Chinese Emperor Wang Zongyan, and a brother older than both of them named Li Xun. They lived at the court of the royal family of Former Shu in Chengdu (modern day Sichuan). Li Shunxian also was a poet. Their family had come to China in 880 and were a wealthy merchant family. Li Xian dealt with Daoist alchemy, perfumes and drugs.\n\nThe Huang Chao rebellion had earlier made their family flee. Li Su-sha, an Iranian who dealt in the incense trade, is speculated to be the grandfather of the three siblings.\n\nLo Hsiang- Lin wrote a biography of the three siblings.

It was recorded that \"The Po- ssu-fu at Kuang-chou make holes all round their ears. There are some who wear more than twenty ear-rings.\" Descriptions of the sexual activities between Liu Chang and the Persian woman in the Song dynasty book the \"Ch'ing-i-lu\" by T'ao Ku were so graphic that the \"Memoirs of the Research Department of the Toyo Bunko (the Oriental Library), Issue 2\" refused to provide any quotes from it while discussing the subject. Liu had free time with the Persian women by delegating the task of governing to others. Multiple women originating from the Persian Gulf lived in Guangzhou's foreign quarter, they were all called \"Persian women\" (波斯婦 Po-ssu-fu or Bosifu).\n\nSome scholars did not differentiate between Persian and Arab, and some say that the Chinese called all women coming from the Persian Gulf \"Persian Women\".\n\nThe young Chinese Emperor Liu Chang of the Southern Han dynasty had a harem, including one Persian girl he nicknamed Mei Zhu, which means \"Beautiful Sow\"(美豬). Liu liked the Persian girl (Mei Zhu) because of her tan skin color, described in French as \"peau mate\" (olive or light brown skinned). He and the Persian girl also liked to forced young couples to go naked and played with them in the palace. and he favored her by \"doting\" on her. During the first year of his reign, he was not over sixteen years old when he had a taste for intercourse with Persian girls.

Li Nu was the ancestor of the Ming Dynasty reformer Li Chih. Lin Nu and his descendants were erased from the family genealogy by his relatives who were angry at him for converting to Islam and marrying a Persian girl because xenophobic feeling against foreigners was strong at that time due to Persian Semu atrocities in the Ispah Rebellion in which the Yuan defeated the Ispah and the Semu were massacred. The branch of the family who held to their Chinese customs felt ashamed so they changed their surname from Lin to Li to avoid associating with their relatives, Lin Nu's descendants with his Persian wife who practiced Islam.\n\nSogdians in China used 9 Chinese surnames after the Chinese name of the states they came from.\n\nXizhou had a Han and Sogdian population.

On the silk road slave girls was a major item and much more expensive than silk. Silk was up to five times less than the value of a slave girl. Central Asian slave girls were exported from Central Asia Iranian areas to China. It is believed that the wealthy merchants and aristocratic noblemen of the Chinese capital of Chang'an were the consumers for the huge amount of Central Asian slave women brought by the Sogdians to China to sell to the Chinese. The Central Asian foreign women in the Sogdian owned wineshops in the Chinese capital are also believe to have been slaves since Chinese poets depicted then as homesick, sad and melancholy and they would service travelers by keeping them company overnight. Merchants and literati would frequent the wineshops. The Sogdians reaped massive profits from selling slave girls and so did the Chinese government by taxing the sale of the slaves. Slave girls were one of the major products Chinese bought from Sogdians. Persian poets often wrote about wine and women since the wineservers were often girls and this wine culture with girl servers seems to have spread to China. There were many Sogdian wineshops and Persian shops in Chang'an along with a large slave market. The wineshops were staffed with young girls who served wine to customers and danced for them. Most of the slave girls were 14 or 15 years old. They provided services like sex, dancing, singing, and served wine to their customers in Chang'an as ordered their masters who ran the wineshops. A Sogdian merchant, Kang Weiyi had Indian, Central Asian, and Bactrians among the 15 slave girls he was bringing to sell in the Chinese capital of Chang'an. Khotan and Kucha both sold women for sexual services.\n\nShi Randian was a Xizhou Sogdian merchant who had a Chinese military title. He went to Guazhou to trade from Kucha. He went to Shazhou and Yizhou. A local acted as Shi Randian's guarantor.\n\nIn 731 a Han Chinese called Tang Rong 唐榮 from the capital district bought an 11 year old slave girl Shimaner 失滿兒 from Mi Lushan 米祿山, a Sogdian recorded in a contract written in Chinese. There was a translator in Xizhou, Di Nanipan who had a Sogdian name but a non-Sogdian surname. Either he was not a Sogdian and was given the name because Sogdian language was prevalent or only his mother was Sogdian was his father was Han.\n\nThe Goguryeo general Gao Juren ordered a mass slaughter of West Asians (Hu) identifying them through their big noses and lances were used to impale tossed children when he stormed Beijing from An Lushan's rebels.\n\nSogdians opened shops which sold wine and had dance performances by Sogdian women called 胡姬酒肆. The poet Li Bai in his poem Shao Nian Xing wrote about a young man who entered one of these Huji Jiusi shops.\n\nLady Caoyena 曹野那 was a concubine of the Chinese Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and gave birth to the Princess of Shou'an Li Chongniang 李蟲娘. The historian Ge Chengji identified Caoyena as a Sogdian from the Principality of Ushrusana 曹國 (昭武九姓) as indicated by the surname Cao which was adopted by Sogdians from Ushrusana who came to China since China called Ushrusana \"Cao kingdom\" and while Yena is a foreign name to Chinese, it is a unisex Sogdian name which means \"most favorite person\" in Sogdian. She may have been one of the Sogdian Hu women “胡人女子” or Sogdian whirling dancing girls “胡旋女” who were given as tribute by Sogdians to China. Names like Cao Yena and Cao Yanna were used by Sogdians which appears on historical texts from Turfan. Chinese frequently bought Hu (Sogdian) slave girls in the Gaochang (Turfan) markets. Yena means favorite one in Sogdian.\n\nLi Bai wrote a poem about a boy riding a white horse \"gently walking in the spring breeze. Where can he be going, after having trodden upon so many fallen flowers? Behold! How he smiles as he enters a tavern attended by a Persian girl!\" The dancing girls jumped and whirled with silk gauze clothing. Western caucasian girls ran these wine stores as Li Bai wrote: \"... how he smiles as he enters a bar tended by a Persian girl.\" These blue eyed girls were frequented by playboys in Chang'an. The northeastern Iranian Sogdians in Khumdeh, Maimargh, Samarkand, and Kesh in 718, 719, 727, and 729 sent dancing whirling girls as tribute to the Chinese Imperial court. Yuan Chen and Bo Juyi wrote poems on these Sogdian girls. The poem by Bo Juyi says the Iranian girl from Sogdia whirled while drums and strings were played and bowed to the Emperor when it was over. It mentioned people already in China learned how to do the whirl like An Lushan and Yang Guifei. Yuan Chen mentioned that a whirling girl was given to the Emperor by the Iranians at the time of An Lushan's rebellion and that the Emperor was enchanted by her dance. The song mentions sashes around her body twirling as she danced. Xuangzang's flight to Sichuan is mentioned at the end of the song. Chinese cities saw high demand for dancers from Central Asia and in the wineshops of the cities the Iranian waitresses were admired over by young Chinese poets. China and India had major appetite for Iranian dancers. Blue eyed waitresses in the pleasure quarters poured wine. Giant balls were used to dance on by the Sogdian whirling girls and dancers from Tashkent. Tashkent dancing girls, according to Bai Juyi, bared their shoulders by pulling their blouses and came out of lotuses when starting their dance. The twirling girls from Sogdia danced on rolling balls and wore boots made otu of deerskin which were colored red, green pants, and crimson robes and they were sent to the Emperor Xuanzong. Western singing and dancing girls filled Chang'an taverns. Samarkand and Tashkent dancing girls who came to China were called \"hu\" which was used by Chinese to refer to Iranian countries. Dancing girls were among the gifts sent in 10 diplomatic embassies from \"Persia\" to China in the reigns of Kaiyuan (Emperor Ruizong)) and Tianbao (Emperor Xuanzong). Emperor Yan-si (Emperor Yang of Sui) received from Persia 10 young girl dancers. Central Asian Iranian girls who performed as acrobats, dancers, musicians, and waitresses were referred to by Chinese poets as Hu ji 胡姬. Tokharestan and Sogdiana style dances like boti, huteng 柘枝, and huxuan 胡旋. TheShi kingdom (Tashkent) brought the Huteng dance to China which involved back flips, leaps and spinning. The Kang kingdom brought the \"whirling barbarian\" huxuan dance to China. It involved spinning while dressed in shoes of red leather and white pants by a woman. The Jumi, Shi, Wei, and Kang kingdoms in Central Asia sent dance girls to perform the huxuan dance for the Xuanzong Emperor in the Tianbao and Kaiyuan eras. Bai Juyi wrote the \"Huxuan Dance Girl\" poem. The \"thorn branch\" zhezhi dance was another one introduced to China. The Sogdian Kang kingdom is where huxuan dance came from according to the Tong Dian by Du Yu. In Luoyang and Chang'an these Serindian dances were extremely popular. Huxian and Huteng dances had connections to the Zoroastrian beliefs practiced in Sogdiana. Huxian and Huteng were practiced by Central Asians in the North Qi dynasty in China. Huxuan dance was introduced to China through long journeys over thousands of kilometers by girls from Kang in Sogdia. In the T'ang Annals we read that in the beginning of the period K'ai-yuan (a.d. 713-741) the country of K'an (Sogdiana), an Iranian region, sent as tribute to the Chinese Court coats-of-mail, cups of rock-crystal, bottles of agate, ostrich-eggs, textiles styled yüe no, dwarfs, and dancing-girls of Hu-suan 胡旋 (Xwārism).1 In the Ts'e fu yüan kwei the date of this event is more accurately fixed in the year 718.2\n\nThe Dunhuang ruler received from the Ganzhou Kaghan 40 Sogdian slaves as tribute.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "330979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330979", "title": "Jap", "text": "Jap\n\nJap is an English abbreviation of the word \"Japanese\". Today it is generally regarded as an ethnic slur among Japanese minority populations in other countries, although English-speaking countries differ in the degree to which they consider the term offensive. In the United States, Japanese Americans have come to find the term very controversial or extremely offensive, even when used as an abbreviation. In the past, Jap was not considered primarily offensive; however, during and after the events of World War II, the term became derogatory.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"Jap\" as an abbreviation for \"Japanese\" was in colloquial use in London around 1880. An example of benign usage was the previous naming of Boondocks Road in Jefferson County, Texas, originally named \"Jap Road\" when it was built in 1905 to honor a popular local rice farmer from Japan.\n\nLater popularized during World War II to describe those of Japanese descent, \"Jap\" was then commonly used in newspaper headlines to refer to the Japanese and Imperial Japan. \"Jap\" became a derogatory term during the war, more so than \"Nip\". Veteran and author Paul Fussell explains the usefulness of the word during the war for creating effective propaganda by saying that \"Japs\" \"was a brisk monosyllable handy for slogans like 'Rap the Jap' or 'Let's Blast the Jap Clean Off the Map'\". Some in the United States Marine Corps tried to combine the word \"Japs\" with \"apes\" to create a new description, \"Japes\", for the Japanese; this neologism never became popular. In post World War II America, schoolchildren often referred to an unannounced test as a \"Jap quiz\" in reference to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The term has fallen out of favor and is largely replaced by \"pop quiz\". \n\nIn the United States the term is now considered derogatory; the \"Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary\" notes it is \"usually disparaging\". A snack food company in Chicago named Japps Foods (for the company founder) changed their name and eponymous potato chip brand to Jays Foods shortly after Pearl Harbor to avoid any negative associations with the name.\n\nSpiro Agnew was criticized in the media in 1968 for an offhand remark, intended to be jocular, referring to reporter Gene Oishi as a \"fat Jap\".\n\nIn Texas, under pressure from civil rights groups, Jefferson County commissioners in 2004 decided to drop the name \"Jap Road\" from a road near the city of Beaumont. Also in adjacent Orange County, \"Jap Lane\" has also been targeted by civil rights groups. The road was originally named for the contributions of Kichimatsu Kishi and the farming colony he founded. And in Arizona, the state department of transportation renamed \"Jap Road\" near Topock, Arizona to \"Bonzai Slough Road\" to note the presence of Japanese agricultural workers and family-owned farms along the Colorado River there in the early 20th century. In November of 2018, in Kansas, automatically-generated license plates which included three digits and \"JAP\" were recalled after a man of Japanese ancestry saw a plate with that pattern and complained to the state.\n\nIn 2003, the Japanese deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Yoshiyuki Motomura, protested the North Korean ambassador's use of the term in retaliation for a Japanese diplomat's use of the term \"North Korea\" instead of the official name, \"Democratic People's Republic of Korea\".\n\nIn 2011, following the term's offhand use in a March 26 article appearing in \"The Spectator\" (\"white-coated Jap bloke\"), the Minister of the Japanese Embassy in London protested that \"most Japanese people find the word 'Japs' offensive, irrespective of the circumstances in which it is used\".\n\nJap-Fest is an annual Japanese car show in Ireland. In 1970, the Japanese fashion designer Kenzo Takada opened the \"Jungle Jap\" boutique in Paris.\nIn 2005 a Japanese couple started a chain of Japanese inspired hot dog stands in Vancouver Canada known as Japadog. \n\nIn Singapore and Hong Kong, the term is used freely as a contraction of the adjective \"Japanese\" rather than as a derogatory term. The Australian news service Asia Pulse has also used the term.\n\nThe word \"Jap\" is used in Dutch as well, where it is also considered an ethnic slur. It frequently appears in the compound \"Jappenkampen\" 'Jap camps', referring to Japanese internment camps for Dutch citizens in the Japanese-occupied Dutch Indies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "590535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590535", "title": "Kanuri people", "text": "Kanuri people\n\nThe Kanuri people (Kanouri, Kanowri, also Yerwa, Bare Bari and several subgroup names) are an African ethnic group living largely in the lands of the former Kanem and Bornu Empires in Niger, Nigeria and Cameroon. Those generally termed Kanuri include several subgroups and dialect groups, some of whom feel themselves distinct from the Kanuri. Most trace their origins to ruling lineages of the medieval Kanem-Bornu Empire, its client states or provinces. In contrast to neighboring Toubou or Zaghawa pastoralists, Kanuri groups have traditionally been sedentary, engaging in farming, fishing the Chad Basin, and engaged in trade and salt processing.\n\nKanuri peoples include several subgroups, and identify by different names in some regions. The Kanuri language was the major language of the Bornu Empire and remains a major language in southeastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon, but in Chad it is limited to handfuls of speakers in urban centers.\n\nThe largest population of Kanuri reside in the northeast corner of Nigeria, where the ceremonial Emirate of Bornu traces direct descent from the Kanem-Bornu empire, founded sometime before 1000 CE. Some 3 million Kanuri speakers live in Nigeria, not including the some 200,000 speakers of the Manga or Mangari dialect. The Nga people in Bauchi State trace their origins to a Kanuri diaspora.\n\nIn southeastern Niger, where they form the majority of the sedentary population, the Kanuri are commonly called Bare Bari (a Hausa name). The 400,000 Kanuri population in Niger includes the Manga or Mangari subgroup, numbering some 100,000 (1997) in the area east of Zinder, who regard themselves as distinct from the Bare Bari.\n\nAround 40,000 (1998) members of the Tumari subgroup, sometimes called Kanembu in Niger, are a distinct Kanuri subgroup living in the N'guigmi area, and are distinct from the Chadian Kanembu people. In the Kaour escarpment oasis of eastern Niger, the Kanuri are further divided into the Bla Bla subgroup, numbering some 20,000 (2003), and are the dominant ethnic group in the salt evaporation and trade industry of Bilma.\n\nKanuri speak varieties of Kanuri, one of the Nilo-Saharan languages. Divisions include the Manga, Tumari, and Bilma dialects of Central Kanuri and the more distinct Kanembu language.\n\nInheriting the religious and cultural traditions of the Kanem-Bornu state, Kanuri peoples are predominantly Sunni Muslim.\n\nIn Chad, Kanembu speakers differentiate themselves from the large Kanuri ethnicity. The Kanembu are centered in Lac Prefecture and southern Kanem Prefecture. Although Kanuri was the major language of the Bornu Empire, in Chad, Kanuri speakers are limited to handfuls of speakers in urban centers. Kanuri remains a major language in southeastern Niger, northeastern Nigeria and northern Cameroon.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Kanembu constituted the greatest part of the population of Lac Prefecture, but some Kanembu also lived in the Chari-Baguirmi Prefecture. Once the core ethnic group of the Kanem-Borno Empire, whose territories at one time included northeastern Nigeria and southern Libya, the Kanembu retain ties beyond the borders of Chad. For example, close family and commercial ties bind them with the Kanuri of northeastern Nigeria. Within Chad, many Kanembu of Lac and Kanem prefectures identify with the Alifa of Mao, the governor of the region in precolonial times.\n\nOriginally a pastoral people, the Kanuri were one of many Nilo-Saharan groups indigenous to the Central South Sahara, beginning their expansion in the area of Lake Chad in the late 7th century, and absorbing both indigenous Nilo-Saharan and Chadic (Afro-Asiatic) speakers. According to Kanuri tradition, Sef, son of Dhu Ifazan of Yemen, arrived in Kanem in the ninth century and united the population into the Sayfawa dynasty. This tradition however, is likely a product of later Islamic influence, reflecting the association with their Arabian origins in the Islamic era. Evidence of indigenous state formation in the Lake Chad area dates back to circa 800 BCE at Zilum.\n\nThe Kanuri became Muslims in the 11th century. Kanem became a centre of Muslim learning and the Kanuri soon controlled all the area surrounding Lake Chad and a powerful empire called Kanem Empire, which reached its height in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when they ruled much of Middle Africa.\n\nFollowing the downfall of the Bornu Empire and the Scramble for Africa in the 19th century, the Kanuri were divided under the rule of the British, French and German Empires.\n\nDespite the loss of the Kanuri-led state, the Shehu of Bornu continues as the head of the Bornu Emirate. This traditional Kanuri/Kanembu state maintains a ceremonial rule of the Kanuri people, based in Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria, but acknowledged by the 4 million Kanuri in neighboring countries. The Shehu (\"Sheikh\") of Bornu draws his authority from a state founded before 1000 CE, the Kanem-Bornu Empire.\n\nThe current ruling line, the al-Kanemi dynasty, dates to the accession of Muhammad al-Amin al-Kanemi in the early 19th century, displacing the Sayfawa dynasty which had ruled from around 1300 CE. The 19th Shehu, Mustafa Ibn Umar El-Kanemi, died in February 2009,\n\nIn Nigeria, famous post-independence Kanuri leaders include the politicians Kashim Ibrahim, Ibrahim Imam, Zannah Bukar Dipcharima, Shettima Ali Monguno, Abba Habib,Muhammad Ngileruma, Baba Gana Kingibe, former GNPP leader Waziri Ibrahim, and the former military ruler, Sani Abacha. In Niger, Kanuri political leaders include the former Prime Minister of Niger Mamane Oumarou, and the former President of Niger, Mamadou Tandja.\n\nA Nigeria specific small Kanuri nationalist movement emerged in 1950s, centred on Bornu. Some \"Pan-Kanuri\" nationalists claimed an area of for the territory of what they called \"Greater Kanowra\", including the modern-day Lac and Kanem Prefectures in Chad, Far North Region in Cameroon and Diffa and Zinder Regions in Niger.\n\nIn 1954, the Borno Youth Movement (BYM) was founded and played a role as a mass regionalist political party up through the end of colonialism, though it petered out at independence.\n\n\n"}

It is ranked in the 651-700 tranche in the QS World University Rankings 2015/16. Kasetsart is ranked 29th in Agriculture and Forestry worldwide in the QS World University Rankings 2017. It was the first agricultural university and the Thailand's third oldest university and the oldest agricultural university in Thailand. It was established on 2 February 1943, to promote subjects related to agricultural science. Since then, Kasetsart University has expanded its subject areas to cover economics, business administration, veterinary medicine, engineering, science, social sciences, humanities, education, and architecture. Kasetsart University's main campus is in Bangkhen, northern Bangkok, with several other campuses throughout Thailand. It is the largest university in Thailand.\n\nIn 1902, King Chulalongkorn attempted to promote the country's silk, silverware, and weaving industries. He hired Dr Kametaro Toyama from the University of Tokyo, to train Siamese students in Japanese silk and weaving crafts. In 1904, the School of Sericulture was founded at Tambon Thung Saladaeng, Bangkok by Prince Benbadhanabongse, the Director of the Department of Sericulture of the Ministry of Agriculture. The school was renamed the School of Agriculture in 1906.\n\nIn 1908, the School of the Ministry of Agriculture was founded at Windsor Palace as the Ministry of Agriculture merged three schools, the School of Surveying (founded in 1882), the School of Irrigation (founded in 1905), and the School of Agriculture. Thailand's first tertiary-level agriculture curriculum began to offer courses in 1909.\n\nIn 1917, Phraya Thepsartsatit and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri of the Ministry of Education founded the first primary school of agriculture under the Ministry of Agriculture, named the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in Tambon Horwang. It moved to Tambon Phra Prathon, Nakhon Pathom Province in 1918.\n\nIn 1931, Prince Sithiporn Kridakara and Chaophraya Thammasakmontri together expanded the school regionally. In the central region, a campus was located in Saraburi Province, in the northern region in Chiang Mai Province, in the northeastern region in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, and in the southern region in Songkhla Province.\n\nIn 1935, the Primary School Agriculture Teacher Training School in each part of the country was closed and merged following the agricultural education policy in that time. Luang Ingkhasikasikan, Luang Suwan Vajokkasikij, and Phra Chuangkasetsinlapakan together proposed to maintain the Mae Jo School (today's Mae Jo University) at Chiang Mai Province only and renamed it Secondary-level Agriculture Technical School before it was elevated to the College of Agriculture, under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture established the Central Agriculture Station or \"Kaset Klang\", in Bang Khen District, Bangkok. It caused the College of Agriculture to move to Bang Khen District in 1938 and the government office at Chiang Mai Province became Kasetsart Preparatory School to prepare students to study at the College of Agriculture in Bang Khen.\n\nIn 1943, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram promoted the College of Agriculture and established Kasetsart University as a department of the Ministry of Agriculture. The university consisted of four faculties: agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and cooperatives (today's Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Business Administration).\n\nIn 1966, Mom Luang Xujati Kambhu, the Fifth President of Kasetsart University, judged the Bang Khen campus too confined and unable to support the education in agricultural sciences called for by the National Social and Economics Development Plan. The Kamphaeng Saen campus was established on 12 November 1979 as a result.\n\nThe university further expanded by establishing Si Racha campus, Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus, Suphan Buri campus, Krabi campus and Lopburi campus. The university already established Si Racha campus in 1989 and the Chalermphrakiat Sakon Nakhon Province campus on 15 August 1996.\n\nOn 18 July 2015, the Kasetsart University Act B.E. 2558 (2015) transformed it from a public university to a national university.\n\nKasetsart University's symbol is Phra Phirun, the god of rain mounted on a Nāga with encircled by lotus petals and then by the words \"มหาวิทยาลัยเกษตรศาสตร์ พ.ศ. ๒๔๘๖\" in the Thai version and \"KASETSART UNIVERSITY 1943\" in the English version.\n\nThe Nontri tree has been a symbol of Kasetsart University since 1963. The king and queen planted nine Nontri trees in the front of Kasetsart University's main auditorium on 29 November 1963 which became historic day for Nisit Kasetsart.\n\nThe Nontri is a tree in the Fabaceae family. It is a long-lived evergreen with grey-brown bark with upright branches. The leaves are bipinnate compound and the flowers are yellow, produced in large compound racemes. Its fruit is a pod containing seeds.\n\nKasetsart University occupies 846 rai (135 hectares) in Bangkok.\n\n\nThe Kamphaeng Saen campus is the first and largest branch of Kasetsart University.\n\nThe Sriracha campus was established in 1988, and occupies an area of 199 rai (32 hectares) in the Si Racha District of Chonburi Province.\n\n\n\nThe QS World University Rankings 2018 ranked Kasetsart University 145th in Asia and 751-800th in the world. In addition, the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2017, the university was ranked 29th in Agriculture & Forestry, 201-250th in Environmental Studies, 401-450th in Biological Sciences, 451-500th in Chemistry, Life Sciences & Medicine, and Engineering & Technology.\n\nThe Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2017–2018 ranked Kasetsart University as the 800-1000th in the world and 251-300th in the BRICS & Emerging Economies.\n\nThe Institute of Food Research and Product Development (IFRPD), is a science and food technology research institute, with the mandate to provide information and services to society as well as research in support of governmental policies to resolve the country's economic problems related to agricultural products.\n\nKasetsart Agricultural and Agro-Industrial Product Improvement Institute (KAPI), is an agricultural and agro-industrial product research institute, established on 29 July 1991 to research and develop quality standards in non-food innovation.\n\nKasetsart University Research and Development Institute (KURDI) administers and coordinates research projects and research efforts.\n\nKasetsart University Institute for Advanced Studies (KUIAS) consists of four research centers: the Center for Advanced Studies for Agriculture and Food; the Center for Advanced Studies in Tropical Natural Resources; the Center for Advanced Studies in Nanotechnology for Chemical, Food and Agricultural Industries; and the Center for Advanced Studies In Industrial Technology.

{"id": "39520572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39520572", "title": "Kenyan English", "text": "Kenyan English\n\nKenyan English is a local dialect of the English language spoken by several communities and individuals in Kenya, and among some Kenyan expatriates in other countries. The dialect contains features unique to it that were derived from local Bantu languages, such as Swahili.\n\nThe English language was introduced to Kenya along with Great Britain's colonisation of Kenya in 1895, when the East Africa Protectorate was set up before becoming a colony in 1920. Swahili had been established as a trade language in most parts of the Swahili Coast at the time of colonization, and it was also used in education. The British reduced the influence of Swahili and made English the medium of instruction in Kenyan schools. English remained in official use after Kenya's independence on 12 December 1963. The official languages of Kenya are English and Swahili, with the latter also recognised as the national language. While English isn't used as commonly as other native languages in Kenya, it is the primarily language spoken in areas such as media, government and schools. Due to this, almost all Kenyans who have educational background know some level of English.\n\nLike English in southern England, Kenyan English is non-rhotic. Major phonological features include the loss of length contrast in vowels, the lack of mid central vowels as with British English, the monophthongisation of diphthongs and the dissolving of consonant clusters. The trap-bath split does not exist in Kenyan English.\n\nAlso, for those who don't speak English as a first language and/or live in rural areas in Kenya, may participate in \"code mixing.\" \"Code mixing\" is the process of using words from a local language while speaking English. A common example of this in Kenya comes from using the Swahili word \"andyu\" while speaking English, which is used to agree with someone.\n\nMispronunciation of English words due to the interference of local Kenyan languages is popularly known in the country as \"shrubbing,\" a word which in all its forms is itself prone to this occurrence. It has been noted that \"shrubbing\" is less likely with upper-middle and upper class citizens, or citizens who do not speak indigenous Kenyan languages and learned English as a first language. Therefore, people living in rural areas and/or those who learned English as a second language and are likely to have a heavier accent are more likely to \"shrub\". \"Shrubbing\" is done by replacing a word's consonant sound(s) with another or others of a similar place of articulation.\n\nSince English is commonly spoken as a second language in Kenya, they tend to follow the Swahili vowel system. This means they tend to follow a five vowel system rather than the twenty vowel system of English. The five vowel system mainly consists of /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/ and these vowels are never diphthongized like some English vowel sounds can be. An example of this can be seen between the words \"hat\", \"hut\", \"heart\" and \"hurt\". In Kenyan English, these words all appear very similar due to substituting all of them with the same vowel of /a/.\n\nThe most evident grammatical features of Kenyan English are the omission of articles, the pluralisation of uncountable nouns, the avoidance of using the relative pronoun \"whose\" and using adjectives as nouns.\n\nIn Kenyan English, a large number of speakers tend to omit articles in words that would otherwise need them. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, a person may say \"give me burger\" or \"I want burger\" instead of \"give me a burger\" or \"I want a burger\". Similarly, the article \"the\" in Kenyan English is often used in cases that would otherwise be deemed inappropriate, especially with uncountable nouns. A good example would be adding the article \"the\" to the uncountable noun \"mud\" (for example, \"I stepped in the mud on my way home.\")\n\nSome uncountable nouns such as \"data\", \"equipment\", \"money\", \"property\" and \"software\" are also often pluralised in Kenyan English, but this is especially prevalent in the rural areas and among the lower and lower-middle classes.\n\n\nA very large number of Kenyan English speakers often use \"My names are…\" when introducing themselves instead of \"My name is…\". For example, a person named John Omondi would introduce himself by saying \"My names are John Omondi\" instead of \"My name is John Omondi\". Again, this is especially prevalent in the rural areas and among the lower and lower-middle classes, but also depends on the ethnic origin of the speaker.\n\nAs mentioned before, there is a tendency to avoid the use of the relative pronoun \"whose\" in Kenyan English, where the use of the word would usually be replaced with \"that\". For example:\n\n\nIn written English, Kenyans often use British English spellings in favour of those in American English, such as \"–our\" instead of \"–or\" (e.g. \"colour\", \"flavour\"), \"–re\" instead of \"–er\" (e.g. \"metre\", \"theatre\"), \"–ogue\" instead of \"–og\" (e.g. \"prologue\", \"catalogue\") and \"–ce\" instead of \"–se\" (e.g. \"defence\", \"offence\"; noun/verb distinction between words such as \"advice\" / \"advise\" or \"licence\" / \"license\" is maintained). However, the use of \"–ize\" and \"–yze\" has become more frequent in favour of \"–ise\" and \"–yse\", although the latter is still more common. For example, more Kenyans have been known to write \"criticize\" and \"paralyze\" as well as \"criticise\" and \"paralyse\".\n\nAs Kenyans generally use British English, vocabulary in Kenyan English is very similar to that of British English. Common examples are \"chips\" and \"fries\" (\"french fries\" and \"fries\" in American English), \"crisps\" (\"chips\" in American English) and \"football\" (\"soccer\" in American English, although the use of the American term has become increasingly common).\n\nKenyan English often borrows vocabulary from local languages which would otherwise be difficult to translate to English, such as the Bantu term \"ugali\", the Swahili term \"sukuma wiki\" (collard greens) and Kikuyu term \"matatu\". The wide use of Sheng in Kenya has also affected the vocabulary of Kenyan English speakers. White people in Kenya are often referred to as \"mzungus\" or \"wazungus\" (the word \"mzungu\" is Swahili for \"white person\"; its plural form is \"wazungu\"). Other borrowed terms include \"pole pole\" (Swahili for \"slowly\"; as a result some people also say \"slowly slowly\"), \"Harambee\", \"nyama choma\" (barbecued meat) and \"nini\" (used when one forgets the name of something; equivalent to the word \"thingy\", which is itself also widely used). Kenyans also tend to use the words \"si\" and \"ati\" (equivalent to the words \"but\" and \"that\" respectively) due to the influence of sheng. Finally, most people in Kenya speak English as a 3rd or 4th language leading to the majority of individuals speaking in the same way as they would say it in their mother tongue.\n\nSome Kenyan English speakers occasionally use proverbs borrowed from Swahili and other languages, as well as English proverbs, when conveying a moral to a story or giving advice, and sometimes translate these proverbs to English. For example, when advising someone to take his/her time when doing something, a person may use the proverb \"Haraka haraka haina baraka\" (roughly translates to \"\") and literally translate it to \"Hurry hurry has no blessings\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1225750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1225750", "title": "Marwari people", "text": "Marwari people\n\nThe Marwari or Marwadi are a South Asian ethno-linguistic group in India and Nepal that originate from the Marwar Shekhawati Jaipur region of Rajasthan and Haryana in broader term, India. Their language, also called Marwari, comes under the umbrella of Rajasthani languages, which is part of the Western Zone of Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nThey have been a highly successful business community, first as inland traders during the era of Rajput kingdoms, and later also as investors in industrial production and other sectors. Today, they control many of the country's largest media groups. Although spread throughout India, historically they have been most concentrated in Kolkata and the hinterlands of central and eastern India.\n\nThe term \"Marwadi\" once referred to the area encompassed by the former princely state of Marwar, also called the Jodhpur region of southwest Rajasthan in India. It has evolved to be a designation for the Rajasthani people in general but it is used particularly with reference to certain jātis that fall within the Bania ethnic category. The most prominent among those communities, whose traditional occupation has been as traders, are the Agrawals, Khandelwals, Maheshwaris and Oswals.\n\nDwijendra Tripathi believes that the term \"Marwari\" was probably used by the traders only when they were outside their home region; that is, by the diaspora.\n\nMarawaris have been known for a tightly-knit social solidarity, described by Selig Harrison in 1960 as \"indissoluble under the impact of the strongest regional solvents\".\n\nMarwari, or Marrubhasha, as it is referred to by Marwaris, is the traditional, historical, language of the Marwari ethnicity. The Marwari language is closely related to the Rajasthani language. The latter evolved from the Old Gujarati (also called \"Old Western Rajasthani\", \"Gujjar Bhakha\" or \"Maru-Gurjar\"), language spoken by the people in Gujarat and Rajasthan. It has been noted that throughout the state of Rajasthan, people avoid identifying their language by name, preferring to identify themselves as speaking \"Rajasthani\" with Marwari literature and taught as Rajasthani until secondary level.\n\nMarwari traders have historically been migratory in habit. The possible causes of this trait include the proximity of their homeland to the major Ganges-Yamuna trade route; movement to escape famine; and the encouragement given to them by various rulers of northern India who saw advantages in having their skills in banking and finance.\n\nThe pattern of Marwari migration became increasingly divergent following the decline in wars between Rajput kingdoms, which the Marwaris had helped to finance, and the decreasing influence of the community over the North Indian caravan trading routes that resulted from the British establishing themselves in the region. The changed focus of migration was also encouraged by the British establishment of new trading routes and centres, as well as by the declining political significance of the Rajput courts whose famed conspicuous consumption had been supported by Marwari money. The community welcomed the relative safety that the British presence offered, as well as the commercial and legal frameworks that they provided and which were more favourable to Marwari activities than the systems prevalent during the earlier period of Mughal and Rajput rule.\n\nThe Marwari Jagat Seth family served as bankers to the Mughals.\n\nAfter the decline of Mughal authority in Bengal, Marwari traders, bankers and financiers migrated to the growing British power in Kolkata . There were particularly significant population shifts to Bombay between 1835-1850 and Kolkata from the 1870s, as well as to Madras. They continued to spread into areas of British control throughout the nineteenth century, becoming established as \"sahukars\" (moneylenders) and inland trade-brokers in central India and Maharashtra. The migration of these traders accelerated in the second half of the nineteenth century which led to growing unpopularity, and acts of communal violence against them.\n\nHistorian Medha M. Kudaisya has said that the Marwaris:\nA considerable number of Marwari business groups made their fortune on speculative markets in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\nAlthough maintaining close and public ties with the British authorities, members of the Marwari business community where early financial supporters of the Indian National Congress, often in secret.\n\nIn 1956, the All-India Marwari Federation opposed a linguistic organisation of states whilst buying up regional language newspapers in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Today, they control many of the country's largest media groups.\n\nThe community's control of the Indian economy declined following the country's 1991 economic reforms. From a peak of controlling 24 per cent in 1990, it had fallen to less than 2 per cent in 2000, apparently because of an unwillingness to adapt. The 2000 figure is considered to be lower than the position in 1939, when the community first began its resurgence.\n\n"}

The appellation \"Nguni\" derives from the Nguni cattle type. \"Ngoni\" (see below) is an older, or a shifted, variant.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that use of \"Nguni\" as a generic label suggests a historical monolithic unity of the peoples in question, where in fact the situation may have been more complex. The linguistic use of the label (referring to a subgrouping of Bantu) is relatively stable.\n\nWithin a subset of Southern Bantu, the label \"Nguni\" is used both genetically (in the linguistic sense) and typologically (quite apart from any historical significance).\n\nThe Nguni languages are closely related, and in many instances different languages are mutually intelligible; in this way, Nguni languages might better be construed as a dialect continuum than as a cluster of separate languages. On more than one occasion, proposals have been put forward to create a unified Nguni language.\n\nIn scholarly literature on southern African languages, the linguistic classificatory category \"Nguni\" is traditionally considered to subsume two subgroups: \"Zunda Nguni\" and \"Tekela Nguni.\" This division is based principally on the salient phonological distinction between corresponding coronal consonants: Zunda and Tekela (thus the native form of the name \"Swati\" and the better-known Zulu form \"Swazi\"), but there is a host of additional linguistic variables that enables a relatively straightforward division into these two substreams of Nguni.\n\n\n\nMaho (2009) also lists S401 Old Mfengu†\n\nThe following aspects of Nguni languages are typical:\n\nCompare the following sentences:\n\nNote: Xhosa = Phuthi = IPA ; Phuthi = ; Zulu = IPA , but in the environment cited here is \"nasally permuted\" to .

{"id": "8898296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8898296", "title": "Pathans of Punjab", "text": "Pathans of Punjab\n\nThe Pathans of Punjab ( ; ; also called Punjabi Pathans are originally Pashtun people (Pathans) who have settled in the Punjab region of Pakistan. Most of these Pashtun communities are scattered throughout the Punjab and have over time assimilated into the Punjabi society and culture. \n\nThese non-frontier Pathans are usually known by the town or locality in which they are settled, e.g. Jalandhuri Pathans, Qasuria Pathans, Multani Pathans, or Lahore.\n\nColonies of Pathans (Pashtun people) arriving in Punjab are accounted for by Sir Densil Ibbetson in the following manner:\n\nThe history of Pathans in India is much earlier. Trapusa and Bahalika, variously assumed to be merchants or slaves from Balkh were the first lay-person to accept Buddha. It should be noted that during that time, the regions west of HinduKush, including Afghanistan were ruled by Mauryan empire and their vassal states of Indo-Greeks. These Indo-Greeks were staunch followers of Vishnu and Buddha and ruled large parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. They gave rise to the Hellenistic form of Buddhism which competed with the Mathura form.\n\nLarge numbers of Pathans accompanied the armies of Mahmud of Ghazni, Muhammad of Ghor and Babur, and many of them obtained grants of land in the Punjab plains and founded Pathan colonies which still exist. Many Pathans were driven out of present-day Afghanistan and khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to devastated invading forces such as Genghis Khan and his Mongol armies, including internal feuds or famine, and have taken refuge in the plains east of the Indus River where the Mongols marked the line of their aggression.Mehmond Pathan Hoshiarpur were also in the army of Mahmud of Ghazni. Which show strength of Pathan tribes\n\nThe tribes most commonly to be found in the Punjab region are the Niazai, Miana, Bangash, Yusufzai, Hassan Zai, Mandanr, Lodhi, Kakar, Sherwani, Orakzai, Tareen, Sulemankhel sulemani, Kakazai, Karlanri, \nbarakzai, Khizerzai and the Zamand Pathans. Of these the most widely distributed are the Yusufzai, of whom a body of 12,000 accompanied the Mughal Emperor Babur in the final invasion of India, and settled in the plains of India and the Punjab. But as a rule the Pathans who have settled away from the frontier have lost all memory of their tribal divisions, and indeed almost all their national characteristics.\n\nSome have suggested a Caucasian-origin to the Afghans, possibly from Alexander the Great's conquest of the Indian Subcontinent. Historical evidence for this idea is, however, limited to hypothesis. A hundred years before Alexander was born, Western Civilization's first historian, Herodotus, who tried to write a history of the world, mentioned the Pathans as \"the nation of Pakhtuike\" (helenized version of the word Pakhtun) who live in Ancient Bactra (modern Afghanistan) and who are \"the most warlike of all the Indians\". Indeed, there is limited, if any, traceable European DNA among the Afghans. A phylogenetic study investigated the possible genetic relation of Pathans with Greeks and found evidence of a limited contributions of Greek genes in the Pathan population. Only 3% of the Pathan population was found to have one chromosome that could be traced to Europe i.e. the Greeks. These would be the (limited) descendant of the soldiers of Alexander who remained in Afghanistan. A much more likely explanation is that the majority of the Pakhtun peoples characteristics developed in the Indian mountain landscape. One possible origin of the word \"Pathan\" is from the Sanskrit word for Mountain-top \"patha\", thus making Pathans the people who came from the mountain tops.\n\nThe main tribes of the Pathans in the Punjab are as follows:\n\nThe Niazi Pathans mainly live in the areas of Punjab like Mianwali, Khanewal and many other cities of Punjab. Notable and famous Niazis are Imran Khan, Attaullah Khan Esakhelvi, Abdul Sattar Khan Niazi, Misbah-ul-Haq, Munir Niazi, Ghulam Akbar Khan Niazi, Sher Afgan Niazi, Inamullah Niazi, Mansoor Aslam Khan Niazi (Sami Khan), Taifoor Khan Niazi, (TV Actor & Brother of Sami Khan), Shadab Khan, The Khan's of Isakhel the owners/sardars of the area (Khawaneens). (Rokhris and Kundis are sub-clans of the Niazi...the Rokhris are mostly found in Mianwali, and the Kundis are found around D.I. Khan district).\n\nKhizar Khel is a clan of Pashtun tribe Niazi from Khaglan Wala, Isakhel.They also live in Khanewal,Sukkur,Karachi,Faisalabad,Bahawalpur and many more cities.\n\nKakars, Tareens,Miana, Mandokhel tribes of Pashtuns from Balochistan have settled in this region.(According to H.A Rose \"descended from miana, brother of tareen, and the cousin of luni).\n\nThe district of Jalandhar is home to well established community of Pashtuns, dating back to the 14th century, since the first Afghan King established his rule in Delhi. The Bangash, Burki and Lodhi tribes were closely connected with the district. The history of the Pathans in the Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar districts is directly connected to the Delhi Sultanate. The Afghans, who played a significant role as part of the nobility, came with their clans to supply fighting men and were, in turn, gifted lands in fertile districts of Punjab, in the Jagirdar system. The kings in Delhi allowed these Khans to create semi-autonomous fiefdoms and govern themselves. This served two purposes: one was to keep them busy in the countryside, so they would remain a step away from the Sultanate itself, as the Afghans had a reputation for being too fiercely independent for the liking of their kings. And the second reason was because all conquering armies from Central Asia had to pass through the Hoshiarpur/Jalandhar region to reach the seat of power in Delhi (Delhi is only a few hours away from Hoshiarpur on horseback).\n\nFor this reason, hundreds of thousands of Afghans were settled in these districts in semi-fortified villages, known as \"basees\" or \"bastis\" (these Pashtuns sometimes referred to as \"basteeon wallay Pathan\"), to act as a wall against any would-be invader. In fact, the broader shape of these bastis was created in a semi-circular shape, curving away from Delhi, as a protective shield. These twin districts were sometimes referred to as \"Punjab ka Afghanistan\", and it was the Sardars of the leading families of this area that, frequently, chose the leadership of the city of Lahore in undivided Punjab as well. \n\nTwo armies of Mongols, one led by Changez Khan's own son as its leading general, were defeated by the Pathans of Hoshiarpur and Jalandhur. The Pathan clans met the Mongols in an adjoining Northern district, Bijwara, near Do-Ab (literally \"two rivers\"). Extra fortifications were built in the area after the first Mongol attempt to cross through and conquer India. This is why, even at the peak of their power, the Mongols, who created the world's largest land empire, were never able to establish rule over Delhi.\n\nTraditions of the Burki tribe point settlement in the district in the 16th century. The earliest settlements were Barikian and Rasta Ikhwand, both in Jalandhar city. After Jalandhar was burnt down by the Gurus of Kartarpur in 1757, Kot Khan Jahan was founded by Khan Jahan. This family was known as the Sadakhel; and other Burki tribes include the Guz, Aliak and Babakhel. Communities of the Burki, in and around the city of Jalandhar were referred to as the basti.\n\nThe Babakhel Burki are said to have come from Kaniguram in South Waziristan in 1617, accompaniying Shaikh Darwesh, leader of the Roshaniya (Pir Roshan)Muslims. The founded Basti Shaikh, having bought this land from the proprietors of Jalandhar. They are also founded the town of Babakhel.\n\nBasti Guzan was founded in the time of the Mughal Emperor Shahjahan, by three sons of Musa Khan of Guz tribe. This Musa Khan had come with Shaikh Darwesh from Kaniguram, and had settled initially in Basti Shaikh. Thry afterwards bought land from the Lodhis and Sayyids, and founded Basti Guzan.\n\nOther bastis (villages) included Basti Ibrahim Khan, Basti Pir Dad Khan, Basti Shah Quli, Basti Daanishmandan and Basti Nau.\n\nIn 1947 the overwhelming majority of these Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar-based Pathans and others in the Indian side moved en masse to Pakistan. Many settled in Lahore and Faislabad.\n\nThe most important and oldest Pashtun settlement in the district was that of the Lodhi tribe. The Lodi clan name originates from the Pashto word Loya, which means \"big\" or \"great\". Many Lodis are very tall in stature. Kot Bure Khan, north of the city of Jalandhar, was said to be the original settlement of the tribe. According to the Ain-i-Akbari, the Jallandhar Mahal was occupied by the Lodi who paid a revenue of 14 lakh of dams. \n\nThe Lodis of the town of Dhogri, six miles north east of Jalandhar, were among the oldest landowners in the district. Their ancestor Tatar Khan, accompanied, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna to India, and settled in the region. Lodhi's are now found in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan.\n\nBahlol Khan Lodi, who went on to found the Lodi Dynasty in Delhi (Sikander Khan, his son, built Agra) made Hoshiarpur his operational base when he began his military career as Governor of Punjab. That is one reason why many members of the Lodi clan moved to Hoshiarpur, and founded many cities and towns bearing the clan's name. It was Sikander Khan's brother, Alam Khan Lodi, who invited Babar to invade India in a sort of \"palace coup\" against his own nephew, Ibrahim Khan Lodi. Ibrahim Khan, who was considered haughty and asked his nobility to bow before him (an unheard of custom among Afghans) was widely considered unfit to be king. This was in direct contrast to Ibrahim Khan's grandfather, Bahlol Khan, who was known as a righteous leader. This led to the First Battle of Panipat. Babar's invading forces were also led by an Afghan, Langar Khan Niazi. The Niazi are a close cousin-clan of the Lodi, both of which belong to the \"Bettani\" branch of Pakhtuns.\n\nThe Marwat Pakhtuns are a sub-clan of the Lodi. A Niazi general was once tasked by the Delhi Sultanate to put down down a Baloch incursion into South-Western Punjab, which was laying waste to large tracts of land. When the Niazi found himself with insufficient men for the job, he reached out to his nearby cousin, Marwat Khan Lodi for assistance. Marwat Khan Lodi is said to have shown up with 100,000 men and crushed the Baloch rebellion. In honor of Marwat Khan's great achievement, his descendants began to use his name to distinguish themselves as a separate clan, thus creating the Marwat clan of Pathans. The area where this battle took place was named \"Lakki Marwat\" i.e. the place where 1 lakh Marwats assembled. Even today, many Marwat Lodis are found in Lakki Marwat district.\n\nAlong with the Niazi, Lodi, Bangash, Tareen and Burki, there were also the Orakzais (most commonly found in Orakzai Agency, which is named after them) and Alizais (who are branched out of the Wazir, after whom Waziristan is named), Kakar, Sur, Yousafzai, Hassanzai, Kakazai and Shinwari Pathans in these Hoshiarpur and Jalandhur basees. The Niazi clan includes descendants of Khwaja Khan, Mehdi Khan and Suleh Khan. There were also Musakhel tribes in Hoshiarpur. Many peoples of Niazi tribe migrated to Pakistan at the time of Partition and are now settled in Multan, Lodhran, Khanewal. The famous Punjabi-language poet Munir Niazi (from the village Khanpur), a Brigadier-General Niaz Ahmad Khan Niazi and his close cousin, the former Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan) Karamat Rahman Niazi also belong to the Hoshiarpur-based Niazi clan. General and Admiral Niazi belonged to the village Mochpur in Hoshiarpur District. Their nephew Tanvir Ahmad Khan (Niazi) was a well-respected Pakistani Foreign Secretary. \n\nThe famous landmark near Mochpur was Qilla [Fort] Sher Khan, a fort which was established when Afghan King Ahmed Shah Abdali came to Hoshiarpur to crush a Sikh uprising against his control over Punjab. Certain Niazi clans of Hoshiarpur trace their arrival in the area to this battle. After the battle, the Niazi men remained in the area and were given responsibility for managing the fort, which was named after one of the important warriors from this Afghan-Sikh battle.\n\nSher Shah Suri's (born Farid Khan Sur; Sur is a cousin-tribe of the Nyazai) family was also settled in the Hoshiarpur/Jalandhar area. Many historians consider Sher Shah to be one of the most competent administrator in the history of the Delhi Sultanate. After Sher Shah's untimely death, his son waged his unsuccessful campaign for the throne against Mughal Emperor Humayun from these Pathan-dominated districts, where he was given refuge. At the height of Mughal power, Emperor Akbar the Great sought to bring these districts under his control more firmly and went to war with these Pathans, but was unsuccessful. Ultimately, Akbar was forced to sue for peace to end hostilities and earn the Afghans favor once more.\n\nWhen the Zamand section was broken up, the Khweshgi (or also pronounced Kheshki) clan migrated to the Ghorband\ndefile, and a large number marched tence with the Mughal Emperor Babar and found great favour at his hands and those of his son Humayun, One section of them settled at Kasur, and are known as\n\"Qasuria or Kasuri Pathans\"\n\nThe Qasuria or kasuri Pathans increased in numbers and importance until the chiefs thought themselves strong enough to refuse to pay tribute to the Mughals. After some severe\nfighting the Qasuria Pathans were compelled to give in, they never lost heart however and maintained their independence until 1807, when they were finally subdued by\nthe Sikhs. After the confiscation of Kasur by Ranjit Singh, the Pathans were ordered to remain on the left bank of the Sutlej where their leader was assigned the Jagir of Mamdot, in Firozpur District. The Mamdot family emigrated to Pakistan, after the independence in 1947. One portion of Kasuri Pathan most called Amchozi settled in Bahawalnagar district at Nadir Shah village near to Bahawalnagar city. Bahawalnagar one Bazar name is Nadir Shah Bazar. These Pathan are landlord as well as in government services. Akbar Khan Amchozi is a graduate civil engineer and working as director engineer in Punjab province.\n\nIn the Indian Punjabi city of Malerkotla, sixty-five percent of the total population is Muslim and out of this population, twenty percent are Punjabi Pathans.\n\nThese Pathans trace their ancestry to Shaikh Sadruddin, a pious man of the Shirani tribe of the Darband area of what is now the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Behlol Lodhi (1451–1517), the Afghan king who had most of the western parts of India under his control, desired to rule Delhi and on his way, he was caught in a sand drift. While there was nothing visible in the darkness, the King spotted a dim light of a lamp still burning in the wind. It was the hut of Shaikh Sadruddin and when the king found out, he came to the hut to show his respect and asked the holy man to pray for him to bear a son and have victory. During 1451 and 1452, the king married off his daughter Taj Murassa to Shaikh Sadruddin after being enthroned in Delhi, and also gave him the area of Malerkotla. The descendents of Shaikh Sadruddin branched into two groups. One started ruling the state and were given the title of \"Nawab\". The other branch lived around the Shrine of Shaikh Sadruddin, controlling its revenue.\n\nOne notable thing about the Punjabi Pathans of Malerkotla is the fact the women strictly observe pardah, albeit they are no longer required to wear the burqa. In regards to language, Pashto was their primary language until 1903. Afterwards, the Malerkotla Pathans began to speak Punjabi and Hindustani. In the city, there are twenty nine shrines to saints from Afghanistan, whom the Malerkotla Pathans revere. Although the level of education is low among the community, many of these Pathans serve in the civil service, particularly in the Indian Police Service. Others maintain businesses, rent property, and rear horses. Because the level of religiosity amongst Malerkotla Pathans is high, many families sent their children to madrasahs where Qur'anic education is compulsory. For higher education, many children study in schools in Patiala or Ludhiana.\n\nThe descendants of Zamand very early migrated in large numbers to Multan, to which province they furnished rulers, till the reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, when a number of the Abdali tribe under the leadership of Shah Husain were driven from Kandahar by tribal feuds, took refuge in Multan, and being early supplemented by other of their kinsmen who were expelled by Mir Wais, the great Ghilzai chief, conquered Multan and founded the tribe well known in the Punjab as Multani Pathans.\n\nZahid Khan Abdali was appointed Governor of Multan with the title of Nawab, at the time of Nadir Shah's invasion. Multan was Governed by different members of this family, until in 1818 the city was captured by the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh, after a heroic defence in which the Nawab and five of his sons were slain.\n\nTheir main clans were the Alizai, Badozai, Bamzai and Saddozai, all clans of the Durrani tribe. Other tribal communities include the Babar, Khakwani, Tareen .\nIn Muzaffargarh District, the Pathans of the district are related to the Multani Pathans. They settled in Muzaffargarh in the 18th century, as small groups of Multani Pathan expended their control from the city of Multan. There distribution is as follows; the Alizai Durrani are found at Lalpur, and the Popalzai are found in Docharkha, while the Babars are based in Khangarh and Tareen in Kuhawar are other important tribes.\n\nMajority of the Pashtuns settled in the Punjab region do not speak Pashto as their first language any longer. Instead they speak Urdu or Punjabi; the Sagri Khattaks of Attock District and the Chhachh area, speak Pashto language and practice Pashtun culture known as Pashtunwali. Sections of Niazi i.e. Sultan khel also speak pashto. The Niazi clan has retained their tribal system and the Pashtun culture compared to other Pathans settled in Punjab. They are known to still follow many aspects of Pashtunwali, the honor-code of the Pakhtuns.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10503982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10503982", "title": "Pravaras", "text": "Pravaras\n\nIn Brahmin Hindu culture, a Pravara (Sanskrit for \"most excellent\") is a particular Brahmin's descent from a \"rishi\" (sage) who belonged to their \"gotra\" (clan). In vedic ritual, the importance of the pravara appears to be in its use by the ritualist for extolling his ancestry and proclaiming, \"as a descendant of worthy ancestors, I am a fit and proper person to do the act I am performing.\" Generally, there are three, five or seven pravaras. The sacred thread yajnopavita worn on upanayana has close and essential connection with the concept of pravaras related to Brahmin gotra system. While tying the knots of sacred thread, an oath is taken in the name of each one of these three, five or seven of the most excellent rishis belonging to one's gotra.\n\nThe full affiliation of a brāhamana consists of (1) gotra, (2)sutra (of Kalpa), (3)shakha, (4)pravaras .\n\n(Example :) A brahmana named 'Rama' introduces himself as follows : I am 'Rama', of Sarvarna gotra, of Gobhil sutra, of Taittiriya shākha of Saamved, of five pravaras named Bhārgava, Chyāvana, Āpnavan, Aurva and Jāmdagnya (This example is based upon the example given by Pattābhirām Shastri in the introduction to Vedārtha-Pārijata, cf. ref.).\n\nWhile the \"gotras\" were classified initially according to seven rishis, the pravaras were classified under the names of the following seven rishis: Agastya,\nAngirasa, Atri, Bhrigu, Kashyap, Vashista, and Vishvamitra.\n\nAccording to the listing of authors included in the verses in Rigved, the rishi Jamadagni was a descendant of rishi Bhrigu while the rishis Gautam and Bharadvaja were the descendants of rishi Angirasa.\n\nThe pravara identifies the association of a person with two, three (or sometimes five) of the above-mentioned rishis. It also signifies the \"Sutras\" contributed to different Vedas by those rishis.\n\nFor example, Gothram has 2 rishis associated with it viz., Nidruva and Avatsara. Another Gothram in Andhra Pradesh has 7 Rishis associated with it viz. Aavatsara, Naidruva, Rebha, Raibha, Sandila, Sandilya.\n\nPravaras also help in identifying different gotras bearing the same name. For eg: Harita Gotra with Pravaras Angirasa, Ambarisha, Yuvanaswa is different from Harita Gotra which has a single Pravara Vashishta.\n\nchatussAgara paryantam gobrAhmaNebhyaH shubhaM bhavatu\nAngIrasa bhAradvAja gArgya shainya trayaRishayoH pravarAnvita\ngargya bhAradvaja gotraH\nApastamba sUtraH TaiTreeya krisHna yajuH shAkhAdhAyI\nshrI rAma sharmaH ahaM bho AbhivAdaye\n\nचतुस्सगारा पर्यन्तं गो ब्रह्मणेभ्यः शुभम भवतु \nअन्गिरस भारद्वाज गार्ग्य शैन्य त्रयारिशयो: प्रवारंविता \nगार्ग्य भारद्वाज गोत्र: अपस्तम्ब सूत्रः यजुह शाखाधायी\nश्री राम शरमः अहम् भो अभिवादये\n\nLine 1: Prelogue: May all the cows and Brahmanas across the four seas be blessed\nLine 2: The names and number of the main rishis to whose lineage the person belongs\nLine 3: Gotra of the person\nLine 4: The sutra that the person follows\nLine 5: The veda shakha that the person belongs to\nLine 6: Name of the person\n\n\n"}

There are estimated to be 8,357 prostitutes in the country.\nProstitution in Guinea-Bissau is common and there are no prostitution laws. In 2016 it was estimated there were 3,138 prostitutes in the country. Often it is associated with other crimes: Many pimps are also reported to be drug dealers. Poverty leads many women to be tempted into prostitution and cocaine addiction.\n\nMany of the prostitutes in Bissau and other towns in Guinea-Bissau are Manjako women from Caio in the Cacheu Region. They tend to be over 30 and wait in designated rooms in their houses for clients. Occasionally they will go to a local bar in search of clients. Prostitutes from Caio also travel to Ziguinchor in Senegal and Banjul in The Gambia to work.\n\nProstitution is illegal but widespread in Liberia. There are estimated to be 1,822 prostitutes in the country. Like its neighbor, Sierra Leone, child prostitution has seen an increase in the aftermath of civil war.\nProstitution is legal in Mali, but third party activities such as procuring are illegal. Prostitution is common in Malian cities. UNAIDS estimate there to be 35,900 prostitutes in the country. Prostitution is on the rise, many having turned to prostitution because of poverty.\n\nIn the capital, Bamako, a large number of the prostitutes are from Nigeria and other West African countries. In July and August there is an influx of students from various areas of West Africa who work as prostitutes during the summer vacation. There are also many Chinese bars in the country where prostitution occurs. It is estimated that the Chinese sex workers send 2 billion Cfa back to China annually. Many Nigerian prostitutes work in the area around the Morila Gold Mine.\n\nProstitution in Mauritania is illegal. There are estimated to be 315 prostitutes in the country.\nProstitution in Niger is illegal but common in the cities, near mines and around military bases. UNAIDS estimate there are 46,630 sex workers in the country. Many have turned to prostitution because of poverty.\n\nSome Nigerian prostitutes ply their trade on the Niger border as many prostitutes are persecuted in their homeland and Niger is perceived as being more amiable and less likely to prosecute them for their trade. Nigerian men prefer to cross the border to seek sex as the punishment in Islamic Nigeria is 50 lashes for \"procuration of woman\".\n\nIn 2017 the government ordered a clampdown on prostitution throughout the country.\nProstitution in Nigeria is illegal in all Northern States that practice Islamic penal code. In Southern Nigeria, the activities of pimps or madams, underage prostitution and the operation or ownership of brothels are penalised under sections 223, 224, and 225 of the Nigerian Criminal Code. Even though Nigerian law does not legalize commercial sex work, it is vague if such work is performed by an independent individual who operates on his or her own accord without the use of pimps or a brothel.\n\nNigeria has become a major exporter of women for prostitution. Deputy president of Senate Ike Ekweremadu has proposed a bill to legalise prostitution.\n\nProstitution in São Tomé and Príncipe is illegal. UNAIDS report there are 89 prostitutes in the capital, São Tomé. When the islands were settled on by the Portuguese in 1493 under Álvaro Caminha, prostitutes were amongst the \"degredados\" sent to the colony.\nProstitution in Senegal is legal and regulated. Prostitutes must be at least 21 years of age, register with the police, carry a valid sanitary card, and test negative for sexually transmitted infections. It has been legal since 1969 to sell sex as long as prostitute has registered, over 21 years old, has a regular medical check-up, and can present an up-to-date medical report card to the police upon request according to Under Senegal's Penal Code (articles 318 to 327 bis). The average age for a sex worker in Senegal is 28 years old and female. Senegal has the distinction of being the only country in Africa to not only legalise prostitution but regulate it. The only condition that it is done discreetly. Prostitution was first legalised in 1966.\nProstitution in Sierra Leone is legal and commonplace. Soliciting and 3rd party involvement are prohibited by the Sexual Offences Act 2012. UNAIDS estimate there are 240,000 prostitutes in the country. They are known locally as 'serpents' because of the hissing noise they use to attract clients.\n\nSince the end of the ten-year civil war in Sierra Leone, there has been an increase in child prostitution, especially among children who are struggling to survive. This has happened in spite of the fact that child prostitution is illegal in the country.\nProstitution in Togo is legal and commonplace. Related activities such as solicitation, living off the earnings of prostitution or procuring are prohibited. Punishment is up to 10 years imprisonment if minors or violence is involved.\n\nIn 2014, it was estimated there were 10,284 sex workers in the country. A 2011 survey found 51% worked in bars and 26% in brothels. About half of the country's sex workers are in Lomé. According to research published in 2015, between 2005 and 2015, prostitution in the country increased 180%, and that three quarters of the prostitutes are Togolese, and Ghanaian women 15%. It is not uncommon for prostitutes travel between Togo and neighbouring countries to find work.\n\n"}

{"id": "54181703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54181703", "title": "Science and technology in Kazakhstan", "text": "Science and technology in Kazakhstan\n\nScience and technology in Kazakhstan outlines government policies to develop science, technology and innovation in Kazakhstan.\n\nThe \"Kazakhstan 2030 Strategy\" was adopted by presidential decree in 1997. Apart from national security and political stability, it focuses on growth based on an open-market economy with a high level of foreign investment, as well as on health, education, energy, transport, communication, infrastructure and professional training.\n\nAfter the first medium-term implementation plan expired in 2010, Kazakhstan rolled out a second plan to 2020. It focuses on accelerating diversification of the economy through industrialization and infrastructure development; the development of human capital; better social services, including housing; stable international relations; and stable interethnic relations. According to the 2009 census, Kazakhs make up 63% of the population and ethnic Russians 24%. Small minorities (less than 3%) make up the remainder, including Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Tatars.\n\nTwo programmes underpin the \"Strategic Plan\" to 2020, the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development (2011−2020) and the State Programme for Educational Development (2011−2014), both adopted by decree in 2010. The latter is designed to ensure access to quality education and fixes a number of targets. For instance, by 2020:\nThe State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development focuses on the twin goals of diversifying the economy and improving Kazakhstan's competitiveness by creating an environment more conducive to industrial development and developing priority economic sectors, including via effective interaction between the government and business sectors. Kazakhstan's economic priorities to 2020 are agriculture, mining and metallurgical complexes, the energy sector, oil and gas, engineering, information and communication technologies (ICTs), chemicals and petrochemicals. Targets include:\nIt is estimated that, by 2006, two-thirds of Kazakh firms were privately owned. Prices in Kazakhstan are almost completely market-based and banking and other financial institutions are much better established than elsewhere in the region. The government can dialogue with private enterprises through Atameken, an association of more than 1 000 enterprises from different sectors, and with foreign investors through the Foreign Investors’ Council, set up in 1998. Kazakhstan nevertheless remains attached to state-led capitalism, with state-owned companies remaining dominant in strategic industries. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the Kazakh government reacted by stepping up its involvement in the economy, even though it had created a wealth fund, Samruk−Kazyna, the same year to further the privatization of state-controlled businesses.\n\nSamruk−Kazyna resulted from the 2008 merger of two joint stock companies, the Kazakhstan Holding for the Management of State Assets (Samruk) and the Sustainable Development Fund (Kazyna). Samruk−Kazyna is charged with modernizing and diversifying the Kazakh economy by attracting investment to priority economic sectors, fostering regional development and strengthening inter-industry and inter-regional links. Oil and gas represent 60−70% of Kazakh exports. A 2% reduction in oil revenue in 2013, subsequent to a drop in prices, cost the Kazakh economy US$1.2 billion, according to Ruslan Sultanov, Director-General of the Centre for Development of Trade Policy, a joint stock company of the Ministry of the Economy and Budget Planning. More than half (54%) of processed products were exported to Belarus and the Russian Federation in 2013, compared to 44% prior to the adoption of the Customs Union in\n\nIn December 2012, President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced the \"Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy\" with the slogan ‘Strong Business, Strong State.’ This pragmatic strategy proposes sweeping socio-economic and political reforms to hoist Kazakhstan among the top 30 economies by 2050. In his January 2014 state of the nation address, the president observed that ‘OECD members have covered a journey of deep modernization. They also demonstrate high levels of investment, research and development, labour efficiency, business opportunities and standards of living. These are the standards for our entrance into the ranks of the 30 most developed nations.’\n\nPromising to explain the strategy's goals to the population in order to ensure public support, the president stressed that ‘the well-being of ordinary citizens should serve as the most important indicator of our progress.’ At the institutional level, he pledged to create an atmosphere of fair competition, justice and rule of law and to ‘shape and implement new counter-corruption strategies.’ Promising local governments more autonomy, he recalled that ‘they must be accountable to the public.’ He pledged to introduce principles of meritocracy into human resources policy for state-owned enterprises and companies. The president recognized the ‘need to update relationships between the state and non-governmental organizations and the private sector’ and announced a privatization programme. A list of state enterprises to be privatized was to be drawn up by the government and the Samruk−Kazyna sovereign wealth fund in the first half of 2014.\n\nThe first stage of the \"2050 Strategy\" focuses on making a ‘modernization leap’ by 2030. The aim is to develop traditional industries and create a processing industrial sector. Singapore and the Republic of Korea are cited as models. The second stage to 2050 will focus on achieving sustainable development via a shift to a knowledge economy reliant on engineering services. High value-added goods are to be produced in traditional sectors during this second stage. In order to smooth the transition to a knowledge economy, there will be a reform of laws related to venture capital, intellectual property protection, support for research and innovation and commercialization of scientific results. Knowledge and technology transfer will be a key focus, with the establishment of research and engineering centres, in cooperation with foreign companies. Multinational companies working in major oil and gas, mining and smelting sectors will be encouraged to create industries to source required products and services. Technology parks will be reinforced, such as the new Innovative Intellectual Cluster at Nazarbayev University in Astana and the Alatau Information Technology Park in Almaty.\n\nIn its \"2050 Strategy\", Kazakhstan gives itself 15 years to evolve into a knowledge economy. New sectors are to be created during each five-year plan. The first of these, covering the years 2010−2014, focused on developing industrial capacity in car manufacturing, aircraft engineering and the production of locomotives, passenger and cargo railroad cars. During the second five-year plan to 2019, the goal is to develop export markets for these products. To enable Kazakhstan to enter the world market of geological exploration, the country intends to increase the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors such as oil and gas. It also intends to develop rare earth metals, given their importance for electronics, laser technology, communication and medical equipment. The second five-year plan coincides with the development of the Business 2020 roadmap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which will make provision for the allocation of grants to SMEs in the regions and for microcredit. The government and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs also plan to develop an effective mechanism for helping start-ups.\n\nDuring subsequent five-year plans to 2050, new industries will be established in fields such as mobile, multi-media, nano- and space technologies, robotics, genetic engineering and alternative energy. Food processing enterprises will be developed with an eye to turning the country into a major regional exporter of beef, dairy and other agricultural products. Low-return, water-intensive crop varieties will be replaced with vegetable, oil and fodder products. The \"Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy\" fixes a target of halving the share of energy revenue in GDP and ensuring that non-resource goods represent 70% of exports by 2050. As part of the shift to a ‘green economy’ by 2030, 15% of acreage will be cultivated with water-saving technologies. Experimental agrarian and innovational clusters will be established and drought-resistant genetically modified crops developed.\n\nInfrastructure development is a priority. In his state of the nation address of January 2014, the president said that highways were currently under construction to link Kazakh cities and turn Kazakhstan into a logistics hub linking Europe and Asia. ‘The Western Europe–Western China corridor is nearly completed and a railway line is being built to Turkmenistan and Iran to gain access for goods to ports in the Gulf,’ the president said. ‘We should increase the capacity of Kazakhstan’s port in Aktau and simplify exportimport procedures. Upon completion, the 1 200 km-long Zhezkazgan−Shalkar−Beineu railway will connect the east and west of the country, providing access to the Caspian and Caucasus regions in the west and to the Chinese port of Lianyungang on the Pacific coast in the east.’\n\nThe traditional energy sector is also to be developed. Existing thermal power stations, many of which already use energy-saving technologies, will be equipped with clean energy technologies. A research centre on future energy and the green economy is to be established by the time Expo 2017 takes place. Environmentally friendly fuel and electric vehicles are to be introduced in public transportation. A new refinery will also be established to produce gas, diesel and aviation fuels. Endowed with the world's biggest uranium reserves, Kazakhstan also plans to set up nuclear power plants to satisfy the country's growing energy needs.\n\nIn February 2014, the National Agency for Technological Development signed an agreement with the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector and a private investor for the establishment of the Central Asia Renewable Energy Fund. Over the next 8−10 years, the fund will invest in Kazakh projects for renewable and alternative energy sources, with an initial endowment of US$ 50−100 million, two-thirds of which is to come from private and foreign investment.\n\nAmong the targets of \"Kazakhstan's 2050 Strategy\" are:\n\nIn February 2011, Kazakhstan adopted the Law on Science. The law encompasses education, science and industry. It has established national research councils in priority areas, including both Kazakh and foreign scientists, thereby enabling Kazakh scientists to participate in high-level decision-making. The decisions adopted by national research councils are executed by the Ministry of Education and Science and line ministries. The law has prioritized the following areas: energy research; innovative technologies in the processing of raw materials; ICTs; life sciences; and basic research. It has introduced three streams of research funding:\nThe originality of this funding framework is that public research institutions and universities may use the funding to invest in scientific infrastructure and utilities, information and communication tools and to cover staffing costs. Funding is disbursed via calls for proposals and tenders.\n\nThe Law on Science has established a system of peer review for research grant applications from universities and research institutes. These competitive grants are examined by the national research councils. The government also plans to increase the share of funding for applied research to 30% and that for experimental development to 50%, leaving 20% for basic research. The law introduced a change to the tax code which reduces corporate income tax by 150% to compensate for businesses’ research expenditure. In parallel, the law extends intellectual property protection. In addition, public and private enterprises are eligible for state loans, so as to encourage the commercialization of research results and attract investment. In order to ensure coherence, independence and transparency in the management of projects and programmes involving science, technology and innovation, the government created the National Centre for State Scientific and Technical Expertise in July 2011. A joint stock company, the centre runs the national research councils, monitors ongoing projects and programmes and evaluates their impact, while maintaining a project database.\n\nWithin the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development, a law was adopted in January 2012 to provide state support for industrial innovation; it establishes the legal, economic and institutional bases for industrial innovation in priority sectors of the economy and identifies means of state support. Within the same programme, the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies has developed an \"Inter-industry Plan\" to stimulate innovation through the provision of grants, engineering services, business incubators and so on.\n\nThe Council on Technology Policy was established in 2010 within the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development. The Council on Technology Policy is responsible for formulating and implementing the state policy on industrial innovation. The National Agency for Technological Development, which was established in 2011, co-ordinates technology programmes and government support. It carries out foresight exercises and planning, monitors programmes, maintains a database on innovation projects and their commercialization, manages relevant infrastructure and co-operates with international bodies to obtain information, education and funding. The main focus of innovation policy for the first three years (2011–2013) is to make enterprises more efficient through technology transfer, technological modernization, the development of business acumen and the introduction of relevant technologies. The following two years will be devoted to developing new competitive products and processes for manufacture. The focus will be on developing project finance, including through joint ventures. In parallel, efforts will be made to organize public events, such as seminars and exhibitions, to expose the public to innovation and to innovators.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Astana. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies, which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. The Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.\n\nKazakhstan devoted 0.18% of GDP to research and development (R&D) in 2013 and 0.17% of GDP to R&D in 2015, down from a decadal high of 0.28% in 2005. The economy has grown faster (by 6% in 2013) than gross domestic expenditure on research and development, which only progressed from PPP$598 million to PPP$714 million between 2005 and 2013. As long as economic growth remains strong, it will be difficult to raise the country's level of expenditure on research and development to 1% of GDP by 2015, the ambitious target of the State Programme for Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development, which was adopted in 2010. The Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy fixes a target of devoting 3% of GDP to research and development by 2050.\n\nIn 2011, the business enterprise sector financed half of all research (52%), the government one-quarter (25%) and higher education one-sixth (16.3%). Since 2007, the share of the business sector in research has progressed from 45% to 52%, largely to the detriment of the government share, which has shrunk from 37% to 25% of total spending. The share of the private non-profit sector has climbed from barely 1% in 2007 to 7% in 2011. Research remains largely concentrated in the country's largest city and former capital, Almaty, home to 52% of research personnel.Public research is largely confined to institutes, with universities making only a token contribution. Research institutes receive their funding from national research councils under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and Science. Their output, however, tends to be disconnected from market needs.\n\nOnly one in eight (12.5%) manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. There appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, even if most industrial enterprises do not conduct research themselves, as enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.\n\nInnovation expenditure more than doubled in Kazakhstan between 2010 and 2011, representing KZT 235 billion (circa US$1.6 billion), or around 1.1% of GDP. Some 11% of the total was spent on research and development. This compares to about 40–70% of innovation expenditure in developed countries. This augmentation was due to a sharp rise in product design and the introduction of new services and production methods over this period, to the detriment of the acquisition of machinery and equipment which has traditionally made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's innovation expenditure. Training costs represented just 2% of innovation expenditure, a much lower share than in developed countries.\n\nIn 2006, the government set up the Science Fund within the State Programme for Scientific Development 2007−2012, in order to encourage market-oriented research by fostering collaboration with private investors. About 80% of the funds disbursed go to research institutes. The fund provides grants and loans for projects in applied research in priority areas for investment, as identified by the government's High Scientific Technology Committee, which is headed by the prime minister. For the period 2007−2012, these were:\n\nThe State Programme for Scientific Development 2007−2012 stipulated that the Science Fund should channel 25% of all science funding by 2010. However, after the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the government's contribution to the fund dropped. The fund adapted by offering more flexible terms, such as interest- and tax-free loans, and by extending the loan period up to 15 years. In parallel, Kazakh scientists were encouraged to reach out to Western partners.\nKazakhstan devotes less to education (2.8% of GDP in 2014) than either Kyrgyzstan (5.5% of GDP in 2014) or Tajikistan (5.2% of GDP in 2014). The share of GDP devoted to higher education has remained stable since 2005 but modest: 0.43% of GDP in 2014. Kazakhstan has nevertheless made great strides in improving the quality of education over the past decade. It now plans to generalize quality education by raising the standard of all secondary schools to the level of its Nazarabayev Intellectual Schools by 2020, which foster critical thinking, autonomous research, a deep analysis of information and proficiency in Kazakh, English and Russian. Kazakhstan is generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school and university, in order to facilitate international ties. Nazarbayev University has been designed as an international research university. The Kazakh government has pledged to increase university scholarships by 25% by 2016.\n\nIn 2007, the government adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the Bologna Process. This process seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area. Several higher education institutions in Kazakhstan (90 of which are private) are members of the European University Association.\n\nIn 2013, the higher education sector performed 31% of research in 2013 and employed more than half (54%) of researchers. There were 1,046 researchers per million inhabitants in Kazakhstan (in head counts). In Central Asia, only Uzbekistan has a greater researcher density: 1,097 per million population in 2011. The global average in 2014 was 1,083 researchers per million population (in full-time equivalents).\n\nKazakhstan has maintained gender parity since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. In 2013, 51.5% of Kazakh researchers were women. Kazakh women dominated medical and health research and represented 45–55% of researchers in engineering and technology. In the business sector, every second researcher was a woman.\n\nTable: PhDs obtained in science and engineering in Central Asia, 2013 or closest year\n\nSource: \"UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030\" (2015), Table 14.1\n\nNote: PhD graduates in science cover life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics and statistics, and computing; PhDs in engineering also cover manufacturing and construction. For Central Asia, the generic term of PhD also encompasses Candidate of Science and Doctor of Science degrees. Data are unavailable for Turkmenistan.\n\nTable: Central Asian researchers by field of science and gender, 2013 or closest year\n\nSource: \"UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030\" (2015), Table 14.1\n\nThe number of scientific papers published in Central Asia grew by almost 50% between 2005 and 2014, driven by Kazakhstan, which overtook Uzbekistan over this period to become the region's most prolific scientific publisher, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Kazakh scientists specialize in physics, followed by chemistry. Between 2005 and 2014, Kazakh scientists tripled their output to 600 articles in a year. They produced 35% of Central Asian articles recorded in the Thomson Reuters' database in 2005 and as many as 56% in 2014. Output nevertheless remains modest. There were 36 articles per million inhabitants in Kazakhstan in 2014, compared to 15 per million for Kyrgyzstan, 11 per million for Uzbekistan and 5 per million for both Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nThe development of more international partnerships may explain the steep rise in Kazakh publications recorded in the Science Citation Index Expanded since 2008. The main partners of Kazakh scientists between 2008 and 2014 were Russians, followed by American, German, British and Japanese scientists.\n\nDespite persistently low investment in research by all five Central Asian republics, national development strategies are nonetheless focusing on developing knowledge economies and new high-tech industries. However, just five Kazakh patents were registered at the US Patent and Trademark Office between 2008 and 2013, compared to three for Uzbek inventors and none at all for the other three Central Asian republics, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nKazakhstan is Central Asia's main trader in high-tech products. Kazakh imports nearly doubled between 2008 and 2013, from US$2.7 billion to US$5.1 billion. There has been a surge in imports of computers, electronics and telecommunications; these products represented an investment of US$744 million in 2008 and US$2.6 billion five years later. The growth in exports was more gradual – from US$2.3 billion to US$3.1 billion – and dominated by chemical products (other than pharmaceuticals), which represented two-thirds of exports in 2008 (US$1.5 billion) and 83% (US$2.6 billion) in 2013.\n\nLike the other four Central Asian republics, Kazakhstan is a member of several international bodies, including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Economic Cooperation Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Kazakhstan and the other four republics are also members of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Programme, which also includes Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia and Pakistan. In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the \"CAREC 2020 Strategy\", a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members’ competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the Caspian Sea and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.\n\nKazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it may encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.\n\nKazakhstan has participated in two research programmes launched by the predecessor of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Eurasian Economic Community.The first is the Innovative Biotechnologies Programme (2011–2015). It involved Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Tajikistan. Within this programme, prizes were awarded at an annual bio-industry exhibition and conference. In 2012, 86 Russian organizations participated, plus three from Belarus, one from Kazakhstan and three from Tajikistan, as well as two scientific research groups from Germany. At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. ‘In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,’ he said. ‘Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.’\n\nThe second project of the Eurasian Economic Community was the establishment of the Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3–90 million and is implemented within a public–private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.\n\nKazakhstan has also been involved in a project launched by the European Union in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage Central Asian countries to participate in research projects within Horizon 2020, the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research project is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions – universities, companies and research institutes – for funding of up to €10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.\n\nThe International Science and Technology Center (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer. ISTC branches have been set up in the following countries party to the agreement: Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The headquarters of ISTC were moved to Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in June 2014, three years after the Russian Federation announced its withdrawal from the centre.\n\nKazakhstan is not a member of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) but the government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the OECD in January 2015 for a two-year Country Programme in support of 'an ambitious set of reforms of Kazakhstan's policies and institutions'. This cooperation led to the publication of an \"OECD Review of Innovation Policy\" devoted to Kazakhstan in 2017.\n\nKazakhstan became the 162nd member of the World Trade Organization on 30 November 2015.\n\nReferences\n"}
{"id": "42327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42327", "title": "Sex education", "text": "Sex education\n\nSex education is the instruction of issues relating to human sexuality, including emotional relations and responsibilities, human sexual anatomy, sexual activity, sexual reproduction, age of consent, reproductive health, reproductive rights, safe sex, birth control and sexual abstinence. Sex education that covers all of these aspects is known as comprehensive sex education. Common avenues for sex education are parents or caregivers, formal school programs, and public health campaigns.\n\nTraditionally, adolescents in many cultures were not given any information on sexual matters, with the discussion of these issues being considered taboo. Such instruction, as was given, was traditionally left to a child's parents, and often this was put off until just before a child's marriage. The progressive education movement of the late 19th century, however, led to the introduction of \"social hygiene\" in North American school curricula and the advent of school-based sex education. Despite early inroads of school-based sex education, most of the information on sexual matters in the mid-20th century was obtained informally from friends and the media, and much of this information was deficient or of dubious value, especially during the period following puberty, when curiosity about sexual matters was the most acute. This deficiency was heightened by the increasing incidence of teenage pregnancies, particularly in Western countries after the 1960s. As part of each country's efforts to reduce such pregnancies, programs of sex education were introduced, initially over strong opposition from parent and religious groups.\n\nThe outbreak of AIDS has given a new sense of urgency to sex education. In many African countries, where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see HIV/AIDS in Africa), sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital public health strategy. Some international organizations such as Planned Parenthood consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits, such as controlling the risk of overpopulation and the advancement of women's rights (see also reproductive rights). The use of mass media campaigns has sometimes resulted in high levels of \"awareness\" coupled with essentially superficial knowledge of HIV transmission.\n\nAccording to SIECUS, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, 93% of adults they surveyed support sexuality education in high school and 84% support it in junior high school. In fact, 88% of parents of junior high school students and 80% of parents of secondary school students believe that sex education in school makes it easier for them to talk to their adolescents about sex. Also, 92% of adolescents report that they want both to talk to their parents about sex and to have comprehensive in-school sex education. Furthermore, a \"study, conducted by Mathematica Policy Research on behalf of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are ineffective.\"\n\nBurt defined sex education as the study of the characteristics of beings: a male and female. Such characteristics make up the person's sexuality. Sexuality is an important aspect of the life of a human being and almost all people, including children, want to know about it. Sex education includes all the educational measures which - regardless of the particular method used - may center on sex. He further said that sex education stands for protection, presentation extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas.\n\nLeepson sees sex education as instruction in various physiological, psychological and sociological aspects of sexual response and reproduction. Kearney (2008) also defined sex education as \"involving a comprehensive course of action by the school, calculated to bring about the socially desirable attitudes, practices and personal conduct on the part of children and adults, that will best protect the individual as a human and the family as a social institution.\" Thus, sex education may also be described as \"sexuality education\", which means that it encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about family planning, reproduction (fertilization, conception and development of the embryo and fetus, through to childbirth), plus information about all aspects of one's sexuality including: body image, sexual orientation, sexual pleasure, values, decision making, communication, dating, relationships, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and how to avoid them, and birth control methods. Various aspects of sex education are considered appropriate in school depending on the age of the students or what the children can comprehend at a particular point in time. Rubin and Kindendall expressed that sex education is not merely the topics of reproduction and teaching how babies are conceived and born. Instead, it has a far richer scope and goal of helping children incorporate sex more meaningfully into their present and future life and to provide them with some basic understanding of virtually every aspect of sex by the time they reach full maturity.\n\nEvidence shows that a combination of comprehensive sex education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers. A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sex education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it. Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the risky behaviors reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs. Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.\n\nAccording to UNFPA, \"A 2010 review found that 'gender-focused' curricula – meaning curricula that integrate gender equality into the learning material – were substantially more effective in reducing risky behaviors than programmes that did not consider gender.\" Research has also shown that delay in sexual initiation, use of condoms and practice contraception has been a result of young people adopting egalitarian attitudes about gender roles. These individuals were also found to be less likely engaged in violent relationships and have a lower rate of STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancy.\n\nBy emphasizing rights and gender issues, these programs help reduce gender-based violence and bullying, promote safe schools, empower young people to advocate for their own rights, and advance gender equality.\n\n\"Few sexual health interventions are designed with input from adolescents. Adolescents have suggested that sex education should be more positive with less emphasis on anatomy and scare tactics; it should focus on negotiation skills in sexual relationships and communication; and details of sexual health clinics should be advertised in areas that adolescents frequent (for example, school toilets, shopping centres).\"\n\nAlso, a U.S. review concludes that \"the overwhelming weight of evidence shows that sex education that discusses contraception does not increase sexual activity\". The 2007 study found that \"No comprehensive program hastened the initiation of sex or increased the frequency of sex, results that many people fear.\" Further, the report showed \"Comprehensive programs worked for both genders, for all major ethnic groups, for sexually inexperienced and experienced teens, in different settings, and in different communities.\"\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) recommends comprehensive sexuality education, as it enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality. According to UNFPA,\n\n\"It is taught over several years, introducing age-appropriate information consistent with the evolving capacities of young people. It includes scientifically accurate, curriculum-based information about human development, anatomy and pregnancy. It also includes information about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. And it goes beyond information, to encourage confidence and improved communication skills. Curricula should also address the social issues surrounding sexuality and reproduction, including cultural norms, family life and interpersonal relationships.\"\n\nHuman rights issues, gender equality and gender roles should be integrated into every aspect of these discussions. This includes human rights protection, fulfilment and empowerment; the impact of gender discrimination; the importance of equality and gender-sensitivity; and the ideas underlying gender roles. Sexual abuse, gender-based violence and harmful practices should also be discussed. Taken together, all this information teaches young people the life skills necessary to assume responsibility for their own behavior and to respect the rights of others.\"\n\nComprehensive sexuality education \"enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality and health. These programmes build life skills and increase responsible behaviors, and because they are based on human rights principles, they help advance human rights, gender equality and the empowerment of young people.\"\n\nSex education may be taught informally, such as when someone receives information from a conversation with a parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.\n\nSometimes formal sex education is taught as a full course as part of the curriculum in junior high school or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad biology, health, home economics, or physical education class. Some schools offer no sex education, since it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including LGBT sex education, and topics dealing with human sexual behavior, e.g. safe sex practices, masturbation, premarital sex, and sexual ethics).\n\nWilhelm Reich commented that sex education of his time was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing excitement-arousal, which is what a pubescent individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he believed to be a basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses. Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.\nThe problem of pregnancy in adolescents is delicate and difficult to assess using sex education. But Calderone believed otherwise, stating that the answer to adolescents' sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such parents should be involved.\n\nWhen sex education is contentiously debated, the chief controversial points are whether covering child sexuality is valuable or detrimental; whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into the curriculum; the use of birth control such as condoms and hormonal contraception; and the impact of such use on pregnancy outside marriage, teenage pregnancy, and the transmission of STIs. Increasing support for abstinence-only sex education by conservative groups has been one of the primary causes of this controversy. Countries with conservative attitudes towards sex education (including the UK and the U.S.) have a higher incidence of STIs and teenage pregnancy.\n\nA survey conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States by Angus Reid Public Opinion in November 2011 asked adult respondents to look back to the time when they were teenagers, and describe how useful several sources were in enabling them to learn more about sex. By far, the largest proportion of respondents in the three countries (74% in Canada, 67% in Britain and 63% in the United States) said that conversations with friends were \"very useful\" or \"moderately useful.\" The next reputable source was the media (television, books, movies, magazines), mentioned by three-in-five British (65%) and Canadians (62%) and more than half of Americans (54%) as useful.\n\nThere are some striking differences on two other sources. While half of Canadians (54%) and Americans (52%) found their sex education courses at school to be useful, only 43% of British share the same view. And while more than half of Americans (57%) say conversations with family were useful, only 49% of Canadians and 35 percent of British had the same experience.\n\nSex education in Africa has focused on stemming the growing AIDS epidemic. Most governments in the region have established AIDS education programs in partnership with the World Health Organization and international NGOs. These programs were undercut significantly by the Global Gag Rule, an initiative put in place by President Ronald Reagan, suspended by President Bill Clinton, and re-instated by President George W. Bush. The Global Gag Rule \"...required nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of their receipt of Federal funds that such organizations would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations...\" The Global Gag Rule was again suspended as one of the first official acts by United States President Barack Obama. The incidences of new HIV transmissions in Uganda decreased dramatically when Clinton supported a comprehensive sex education approach (including information about contraception and abortion). According to Ugandan AIDS activists, the Global Gag Rule undermined community efforts to reduce HIV prevalence and HIV transmission.\n\nEgypt teaches knowledge about male and female reproductive systems, sexual organs, contraception and STDs in public schools at the second and third years of the middle-preparatory phase (when students are aged 12–14). A coordinated program between UNDP, UNICEF, and the ministries of health and education promotes sexual education at a larger scale in rural areas and spreads awareness of the dangers of female genital mutilation.\n\nThe state of sex education programs in Asia is at various stages of development.\n\nIn Thailand there has been progress on sex education, with the boundaries being pushed forward with each revision of the curriculum. The first national policy on sexuality education in schools was announced in 1938, but sex education was not taught in schools until 1978. It was then called \"Life and Family Studies\", and its content consisted of issues related to the reproductive system and personal hygiene. The education curriculum has been revised several times, involving efforts from both government and non-government sectors, and sex education has been accepted as a problem solving tool for adolescent sexual reproduction and health issues. This has been a consequence of educational reform following the National Education Act B.E. 2542, increasing awareness of problems related to adolescents’ sexual practices, and the emergence of women’s sexuality and queer movements. Another new approach in sexuality education curricula in Thailand has been the Teenpath Project developed by PATH, Thailand. PATH has also succeeded in institutionalizing sexuality education curricula in schools since 2003.\n\nIn India, there are many programs promoting sex education including information on AIDS in schools as well public education and advertising. AIDS clinics however are not universally available.\n\nIn 2000, a new five-year project was introduced by the China Family Planning Association to \"promote reproductive health education among Chinese teenagers and unmarried youth\" in twelve urban districts and three counties. This included discussion about sex within human relationships as well as pregnancy and HIV prevention. More recently, there has a been a great increase in books about sex education for children and young adults.\n\nIndonesia, Mongolia, and South Korea have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools. Malaysia and Thailand have assessed adolescent reproductive health needs with a view to developing adolescent-specific training, messages and materials.\n\nBangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan have no coordinated sex education programs.\n\nIn Japan, sex education is mandatory from age 10 or 11, mainly covering biological topics such as menstruation and ejaculation.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, sex education traditionally consisted of reading the reproduction section of biology textbooks. In Sri Lanka young people are taught when they are 17–18 years old. \n\nThe International Planned Parenthood Federation and the BBC World Service ran a 12-part series known as \"Sexwise\", which discussed sex education, family life education, contraception and parenting. It was first launched in South Asia and then extended worldwide.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the German Federal Office of Health Education recommend sex education for children of all ages.\n\nIn Finland, sexual education is usually incorporated into various compulsory courses, mainly as part of biology lessons (in lower grades) and later in a course related to general health issues.\n\nIn France, sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms, to students in grades 8 and 9 (aged 15–16). In January 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.\nIn September 2013, the government launched a new program called \"les ABCD de l’égalité\" (the ABCD of equality) whose main aim is to \"fight gender stereotypes at school\". The ultimate goal is to foster mutual respect between boys and girls early on so that it impacts their conception of the world later on.\n\nThe first state-sponsored courses on sex education were introduced in Breslau, Prussia c. 1900 by Dr. Martin Chotzen.\n\nIn Germany, sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is a governmental duty by law.\n\nIt normally covers all subjects concerning the process of growing up, bodily changes during puberty, emotions involved, the biological process of reproduction, sexual activity, partnership, homosexuality, unwanted pregnancies and the complications of abortion, the dangers of sexual violence, child abuse, and sex-transmitted diseases. It is comprehensive enough that it sometimes also includes things in its curricula such as sex positions. Most schools offer courses on the correct usage of contraception.\n\nA sex survey by the World Health Organization concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among 15- to 19-year-olds was very low—only 11.7 per 1000 people, compared to 27.8 births per 1,000 people in the UK, and 39.0 births per 1,000 people in Bulgaria (which, incidentally, has the highest birth rate in Europe).\n\nGerman Constitutional Court and later, in 2011, the European Court of Human Rights, rejected complaints from several Baptists against Germany concerning mandatory sex education.\n\nFrom a Western point of view, sex education in Poland has never actually developed. At the time of the People's Republic of Poland, since 1973, it was one of the school subjects; however, it was relatively poor and did not achieve any actual success. After 1989, it practically vanished from the school life—it is currently a subject called \"Family Life Education\" (\"wychowanie do życia w rodzinie\") rather than \"Sex Education\" (\"edukacja seksualna\")—and schools explicitly require parental consent for their children to attend sex ed classes. This policy is largely due to the strong objection against sex education raised by the Catholic Church.\n\nSome sex education is taught as part of biology-related curricula. There is also an official program intended to provide sex education for students.\n\nSubsidized by the Dutch government, the \"Long Live Love\" package (\"Lang leve de liefde\"), developed in the late 1980s, aims to give teenagers the skills to make their own decisions regarding health and sexuality. Nearly all secondary schools provide sex education, as part of biology classes and over half of primary schools discuss sexuality and contraception. Starting the 2012 school year, age-appropriate sex education—including education about sexual diversity —will be compulsory in all secondary and primary schools. The curriculum focuses on biological aspects of reproduction as well as on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills. Dutch sex education encourages the idea that topics like masturbation, homosexuality, and sexual pleasure are normal or natural and that there are larger emotional, relational, and societal forces that shape the experiences of sexuality. Moreover, according to Amy Schalet, Dutch parents tend to form close relationships with their children, openly discussing teen sexuality. Dutch parents try to accept their children's romantic relationships and even allow sleepovers, expecting them to have sex. The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach. The Netherlands has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world, and the Dutch approach is often seen as a model for other countries.\n\nIn the Slovak republic the content of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to \"Nature science\" in English (this course covers both biology and petrology). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and is dependent on the teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.\n\nIn Sweden, sex education was established in 1921 for secondary education and in 1942 for all grades. The subject is usually started in kindergarten and continues cumulatively throughout the student's entire schooling. This sexual education is incorporated into different subjects such as biology and history. The Swedish Association for Sexuality Education (RFSU) has a sex education that emphasizes \"sexual diversity, freedom and enjoyment,\" and the RFSU collaborate frequently with government organizations such as the National Institute of Public Health. Alongside this emphasis of sexual diversity, Swedish sex education has equal incorporations of lesbian and gay sexuality as well as heterosexual sexuality. They provide knowledge about masturbation, oral and anal sex as well as heterosexual, genital intercourse.\n\nIn Switzerland, the content and amount of sex education is decided at the cantonal level. In Geneva, courses have been given at the secondary level first for girls since 1926 and compulsory programs have been implemented at secondary level for all classes since the 1950s. In most French-speaking cantons since the '70s, generalized courses have been implemented by states with duly formed and trained specialists working within school health services at the secondary level.\n\nInterventions in primary schools were started during the '80s, with the basic objective of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told that they can have their own feelings about themselves, and informed on who to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.\n\nFinally, the objectives include an enforcement of their capacity to decide for themselves and their ability to express their feeling about a situation and say \"No\". In secondary schools, there are programs at ages 13–14 and 16-17 with the basic objective to give students a secure moment with caring, well informed adults. With confidentiality and mutual respect, students can talk to an adult who understands youth needs and what they should know about sexual life in conformity with age and maturity.\n\nIn the German part of the country, the situation is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each State to decide, there are efforts, notably under the auspices of \"Santé sexuelle Suisse\" - the Swiss branch of IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation) - to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.\n\nCecil Reddie ran the first sex education course at a British school in October 1889 at Abbotsholme School.\n\nIn England and Wales, Sex and relationship education (SRE) is currently compulsory, in part, from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It doesn’t promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. The compulsory parts of sex and relationship education are the elements contained within the national curriculum for science. Parents can currently withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.\n\nThe compulsory curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, foetal development, and the physical and emotional changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe However, these have halved across England and Wales in recent years and continue to fall.\n\nSome schools actively choose to deliver age appropriate relationship and sex education from Early Years Foundation Stage, which include the differences between boys and girls, naming body parts, what areas of the body are private and should not be touched unless the child is happy and gives consent.\n\nFollowing sustained political pressure, in March 2017 it was announced by the Department for Education (DofE) that from September 2019, Relationship Education (RE) in primary schools and Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) in secondary schools will be made mandatory in England by the UK government. The existing category of SRE (Sex and Relationship Education), is now referred to as RSE (Relationship and Sex Education) by the British government.\n\nA consultation was held by the DofE from 19 December 2017 to 12 February 2018 to inform the updated guidelines that will be released prior to the new mandatory subject being added to the curriculum in England in 2019.\n\nThe main sex education programme in Scotland is \"Healthy Respect\", which focuses not only on the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate sex education programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the Scottish Government, the programme \"Called to Love\" focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of abstinence-only sex education.\n\nAs education is a provincial concern, sex education varies across Canada. Ontario has a provincial curriculum created in 1998. Attempting to update it has proven controversial: a first reform was shelved in 2010 and a new curriculum introduced in 2015 by the Liberal government under Kathleen Wynne was reversed three years later by the Conservatives under Doug Ford, inviting parents to file complaints against teachers who won't comply with the change. Mandatory sex education was removed from the Quebec provincial curriculum in 2005, leaving it at the discretion of each teacher. With rates of syphilis and gonorrhea rising in the province since this change, several researchers and sex educators are criticizing the current policy, most notably Lisa Trimble and Stephanie Mitelman. It was brought back as a facultative subject in 2016-2017, then mandatory for the 2017-2018 school year.\n\nAlmost all U.S. students receive some form of sex education at least once between grades 7 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics in grades 5 or 6. However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are so decentralized. Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes and contain provisions to allow parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts.\n\nFor example, a 1999 study by the Guttmacher Institute found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, HIV, STIs, abstinence, implications of teenage pregnancy, and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of birth control and infection prevention, sexual orientation, sexual abuse, and factual and ethical information about abortion, varied more widely.\n\nOnly two forms of sex education are taught in American schools: \"abstinence plus\" and \"abstinence-only\". \"Abstinence plus\" (also known as comprehensive sex education) covers abstinence as a positive choice, but also teaches about contraception and the avoidance of STIs when sexually active. A 2002 study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 58% of secondary school principals describe their sex education curriculum as \"abstinence plus\".\n\nAbstinence-only sex education tells teenagers that they should be sexually abstinent until marriage and does not provide information about contraception. In the Kaiser study, 34% of high-school principals said their school's main message was abstinence-only.\n\nAmong 48 of the 50 U.S. states (the exceptions were North Dakota and Wyoming) in their 2005 state laws and policies, 21 stressed abstinence-only sexual education and 7 emphasized that abstinence should be taught in their state's sexual education programs. Only 11 states require that students receive both comprehensive and abstinence education and 9 states did not mention any sort of sexual education in their laws and policies.\n\nThe difference between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject. In the U.S., teenage birth rates had been dropping since 1991, but a 2007 report showed a 3% increase from 2005 to 2006. From 1991 to 2005, the percentage of teens reporting that they had ever had sex or were currently sexually active showed small declines. However, the U.S. still has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens in the industrialized world. Public opinion polls conducted over the years have found that the vast majority of Americans favor broader sex education programs over those that teach only abstinence, although abstinence educators recently published poll data with the opposite conclusion.\n\nProponents of comprehensive sex education, which include the American Psychological Association, the American Medical Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, the Society for Adolescent Medicine and the American College Health Association, argue that sexual behavior after puberty is a given, and it is therefore crucial to provide information about the risks and how they can be minimized; they also claim that denying teens such factual information leads to unwanted pregnancies and STIs.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of abstinence-only sex education object to curricula that fail to teach their standard of moral behavior; they maintain that a morality which is based on sex only within the bounds of marriage is \"healthy and constructive\" and that value-free knowledge of the body may lead to immoral, unhealthy, and harmful practices. Within the last decade, the federal government has encouraged abstinence-only education by steering over a billion dollars to such programs. Some 25 states now decline the funding so that they can continue to teach comprehensive sex education. Funding for one of the federal government's two main abstinence-only funding programs, \"Title V\", was extended only until December 31, 2007; Congress is debating whether to continue it past that date.\n\nThe impact of the rise in abstinence-only education remains a question. To date, no published studies of abstinence-only programs have found consistent and significant program effects on delaying the onset of intercourse. In 2007, a study ordered by the U.S. Congress found that middle school students who took part in abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex (and use contraception) in their teenage years as those who did not. Abstinence-only advocates claimed that the study was flawed because it was too narrow and began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and that other studies have demonstrated positive effects.\n\nAccording to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in 2007, teen pregnancies in the United States showed a 3% increase in the teen birth rate from 2005 to 2006, to nearly 42 births per 1,000.\n\nAccording to Anna Mulrine of \"U.S. News & World Report\", records show that professionals still do not know which method of sex education works best to keep teens from engaging in sexual activity, but they are still working to find out.\n\nVirginia uses the sex education program called The National Campaign to prevent teen and unplanned pregnancy. The National Campaign was created in 1996 and focuses on preventing teen and unplanned pregnancies of young adults. The National Campaign set a goal to reduce teen pregnancy rate by 1/3 in 10 years. The Virginia Department of Health ranked Virginia 19th in teen pregnancy birth rates in 1996. Virginia was also rated 35.2 teen births per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 in 2006. The Healthy people 2010 goal is a teen pregnancy rate at or below 43 pregnancies per 1,000 females age 15–17.\n\nSex education in Texas has recently become a policy of much focus in the state. With the rise of recent protests and proposed bills in the Texas House, the current policy has been the focus of much scrutiny. As of 1997, when Senate Bill 1 was enacted, Texas has left the decision of inclusion of sex education classes within schools up to the individual districts. The school board members are entitled to approve all curricula that are taught; however the bill has certain criteria that a school must abide by when choosing to teach Sex Ed. These include:\n\nAdditionally, school districts are not authorized to distribute condoms in connection with instruction relating to human sexuality.\n\nSince the enactment of this policy, several research studies have been done to evaluate the Sex Ed Policy, namely the \"abstinence-only\" aspect of the teaching. Drs. David Wiley and Kelly Wilson published the \"Just Say Don't Know: Sexuality Education in Texas Public Schools\" report where they found that:\n\nAccording to Texas State Representative Mike Villarreal, \"We have a responsibility to ensure that our children receive accurate information in the classroom, particularly when students' health is at stake,\" Villarreal said. \"We're dealing with a myriad of problems in Texas as a result of our sky high teen pregnancy rates. We cannot allow our schools to provide erroneous information—the stakes are far too high.\" With this in mind, many state legislators have proposed bills to improve sex education in Texas Schools.\nScientific evidence accumulated over many decades clearly demonstrates that the abstinence-only-until-married (AOUM) curriculum taught in Texas schools is harmful and ineffective in reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate in Texas. Despite these facts, recently published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, AOUM programs continue to be funded by the U.S. government. In fact, the U.S. government has spent more than $2 billion over the last 20 years to prohibit much-needed sex education in public schools, choosing instead to fund the AOUM curriculum while the adolescent pregnancy rates continue to rise.\n\nCatholic schools in Texas follow Catholic Church teachings in regard to Sex Education. Some opponents of sex education in Catholic schools believe sex ed programs are doing more harm to the young than good. Opponents of sex education contend that children are not mentally and emotionally ready for this type of instruction, and believe that exposing the young to sex ed programs may foster the students with the preoccupation of sex.\n\nThe Catholic Church believes that parents are the first educators and should rightfully fight for their duty as such in regard to sex education:\n\nThe Government of Victoria (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of \"Health and Human Relations Education\" in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981. The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable Norman Lacy MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979-1982.\n\nA \"Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education\" was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame Margaret Blackwood; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.\n\nThe Council had three major functions:\n\nSupport services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the Special Services Division of the Education Department of Victoria and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of \"Health and Human Relations Education\".\n\nIn 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of \"Health and Human Relations Education\" in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as Government policy.\n\nIn New Zealand, sexuality education is part of the Health and Physical Education curriculum, which is compulsory for the first ten years of schooling (Years 1 to 10) but optional beyond that. Sexual and reproductive health education begins at Year 7 (approx. age 11), although broader issues such as physical, emotional and social development, personal and interpersonal skills, and (non-sexual) relationships begin as early as Year 1 (approx. age 5).\n\nThe Health / \"Hauora\" curriculum, including the sexuality education component, is the only part of the New Zealand Curriculum / \"Te Matauranga o Aotearoa\" (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and state-integrated schools must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years. Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made. However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.\n\nThere are two opposing sides of the sex education argument amongst parents. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals to be included in the conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through abstinence-only programs.\n\nAnother viewpoint on sex education, historically inspired by sexologists such as Wilhelm Reich and psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and James W. Prescott, holds that what is at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual mores. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized sexual oppression and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of \"Reid About Sex\" suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.\n\nSome claim that certain sex education curricula break down pre-existing notions of modesty or encourage acceptance of what they consider immoral practices, such as homosexuality or premarital sex. A website which supports that view is the Coalition for Positive Sexuality. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are a normal part of the range of human sexuality disagree with them.\n\nSociologist Amitai Etzioni argues sex education provides an opportunity to teach students facts about health within the context of values that responsible and moral persons seek to affirm and embody in their lives. Instead of teaching sex as a purely scientific biological process, sex education should promote discussions about human nature, intimacy, and how social commitments improve health and happiness. Programs should discuss responsibilities to better equip students with communication skills and conflict resolution strategies.\n\nMany religions teach that sexual behavior outside of marriage is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught as a part of sex education. They may believe that sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on abstinence.\n\nOne major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula. LGBT sex education includes safe sex practices for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals and general instruction in topics related to homosexuality. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today. Eight states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.\n\nProponents of LGBT sex education argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT students with the sexual health information they need, and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals. They also claim that it could reduce homophobic bullying.\n\nAn example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age. In the UK, BigTalk Education's Growing Up Safe programme includes LGBT relationship education from Primary School age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.\n\nOpponents often argue that teaching LGBT sex education would be disrespectful to some religions and expose students to inappropriate topics. They say that including homosexuality in the curriculum would violate parents’ rights to control what their children are exposed to and that schools should not inflict a particular political view on students. Currently, many sex education curricula do not include LGBT topics, and research has reported that students often feel that they do not receive adequate instruction in LGBT sex topics.\n\n\n"}

The lowest tenant of all was the freeholder, or, as he was sometimes termed, \"tenant paravail\". The Crown, who in theory owned all lands, was \"lord paramount\".\n\nThe great lords looked with dissatisfaction on the increase of such subtenures. Accordingly, in 1290 a statute was passed, , which allowed the tenant to alienate whenever he pleased, but the person to whom he granted the land was to hold it for the same immediate lord, and by the same services as the alienor held it before.\n\nIn Scots law, the feudal system was abolished by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. The length of a lease was limited to 175 years to prevent the existence of perpetual landlord-tenant relationships similar to those that existed under feudal tenure.\n\nWithin the Holy Roman Empire, mesne fiefs were known as \"Afterlehen\", which became inheritable over time and could have up to five \"stations\" between the actual holder of the fief and the overarching liege lord.\n\n"}

{"id": "41897927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41897927", "title": "The Intercept", "text": "The Intercept\n\nThe Intercept is an online news publication dedicated to what it describes as \"adversarial journalism\". It is supported financially by First Look Media, owned by Pierre Omidyar. Its editors are Betsy Reed, Glenn Greenwald, and Jeremy Scahill. Former editor Laura Poitras left the publication to work on non-fiction films. \"The Intercept\" also publishes two podcasts: \"Intercepted\" hosted by Scahill and \"Deconstructed\" hosted by Mehdi Hasan.\n\n\"The Intercept\" launched in February 2014, the first project of First Look Media, a news organization created and funded by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. The publication initially served as a platform to report on the documents released by Edward Snowden, with the long-term goal of producing journalism across a wide range of issues.\n\n\"The Intercept\" first published story was an in-depth report in February 2014 about the NSA's involvement in the U.S. targeted killing program, which detailed the flawed methods that are used to locate targets for lethal drone strikes, resulting in the deaths of innocent people. This was followed by an article containing new aerial photographs of the NSA, NRO, and NGA headquarters.\n\nIn March 2014, \"The Intercept\" published leaked documents from Edward Snowden showing that the National Security Agency was building a system to infect potentially millions of computers around the world with malware. The report included a top-secret NSA animation showing how the agency disguised itself as a Facebook server in order to hack into computers for surveillance. The story reportedly prompted Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to telephone President Obama and complain about NSA's surveillance. Zuckerberg later wrote in a blog post: \"I've called President Obama to express my frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future.\"\n\nIn May 2014, \"The Intercept\" reported that the National Security Agency (NSA) was secretly intercepting, recording, and archiving the audio of virtually every cell phone conversation on the island nation of the Bahamas and collecting cell phone metadata in Mexico, the Philippines, and Kenya. Following the report, \"The Intercept\" was criticized by WikiLeaks for withholding the name of one country whose calls were being recorded. WikiLeaks announced that \"the country in question is Afghanistan.\"\n\nIn July 2014, \"The Intercept\" obtained leaked documents revealing that the Obama administration approved a major expansion of the terrorist watchlist system, authorizing a secret process that required neither \"concrete facts\" nor \"irrefutable evidence\" to designate an American or foreigner as a terrorist. In August 2014, \"The Intercept\" reported that nearly half of the people on the U.S. government's widely shared database of terrorist suspects were not connected to any known terrorist group. The watchlist reports prompted intelligence officials to consider requesting a criminal investigation into \"The Intercept\" sources. In October 2014, it was reported that the FBI had raided the home of the suspected source in northern Virginia, outside Washington, D.C.\n\nIn December 2014, \"The Intercept\" published new leaked documents from Edward Snowden showing that British surveillance agency Government Communications Headquarters was behind an attack, codenamed Operation Socialist, on Belgacom's systems (Belgium's largest telecom). The attack was described by Snowden as the \"first documented example to show one EU member state mounting a cyber attack on another.\"\n\nIn April 2015, \"The Intercept\" reported in collaboration with \"Der Spiegel\" that a U.S. military base in Ramstein, Germany, serves as the \"high-tech heart\" of America's drone program. Ramstein is the site of a satellite relay station that enables drone operators in the American southwest to communicate with their remote aircraft in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and other targeted countries. \"The Intercept\" cited a top-secret document and a confidential source, who said that \"Ramstein carries the signal to tell the drone what to do and it returns the display of what the drone sees. Without Ramstein, drones could not function, at least not as they do now.\"\n\nIn September 2015, \"The Intercept\" disclosed dozens of top-secret British intelligence documents, which revealed that spy agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) was trying to build a surveillance system to monitor \"every visible user on the internet\". It reported that GCHQ was developing new techniques to perform \"population-scale\" data mining, monitoring all communications across entire countries in an effort to detect patterns or behaviors deemed suspicious.\n\nIn October 2015, \"The Intercept\" published the Drone Papers, a series of stories based on a cache of leaked secret documents detailing the inner workings of the U.S. military's assassination program in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia. The news site said that the documents were \"provided by a whistleblower\" and offered \"an unprecedented glimpse into Obama's drone wars\". The revelations were praised by Pentagon Papers whistleblower, Daniel Ellsberg, and NSA leaker, Edward Snowden, who said: \"When we look back on today, we will find the most important national security story of the year.\" Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, described the Drone Papers reports as \"pretty remarkable stuff.\" He added: \"In some ways it reconfirms and illuminates much of what we knew, or thought we knew, about a lot of these programs, like that the administration firmly prefers kill over capture despite claiming the opposite, and that there's not 'a bunch of folks in the room', as Obama calls it – that there's a clear, bureaucratic process for this. It clearly shows, as we've known, that the United States does not know who it's killing.\" The White House and National Security Council declined to comment, saying in a statement that it does not \"comment on the details of classified reports.\"\n\nIn November 2016, \"The Intercept\" revealed that a windowless skyscraper in New York City's Lower Manhattan, owned by AT&T, hosts a secret National Security Agency surveillance site \"that is used to tap into phone calls, faxes, and internet data.\"\n\nOn January 10, 2017, \"The Intercept\" reported that members of elite U.S. military unit, SEAL Team Six, had committed potential war crimes, including mutilating corpses and attempted beheadings. Senior command staff were aware of the misconduct, but did little to stop it, and in some cases helped to cover up the wrongdoing, according to the report.\n\nOn January 31, 2017, \"The Intercept\" published leaked documents from the FBI, revealing that the bureau can use \"national security letters\" to spy on journalists without the previously necessary step of obtaining permission from a judge. Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the rules were \"incredibly weak and almost nonexistent.\" The documents also showed that the FBI uses the threat of deportation to turn immigrants into confidential informants.\n\nIn June 2017, \"The Intercept\" released a top-secret document leaked from NSA, which revealed information about hacking efforts by Russian military intelligence against several U.S. state and local government agencies during the 2016 United States elections.\n\nIn February 2016, \"The Intercept\" won a National Magazine Award for columns and commentary by the writer Barrett Brown, and it was a finalist in the public interest category for a series by Sharon Lerner called the Teflon Toxin, which exposed how DuPont harmed the public and its workers with toxic chemicals. In April 2016, \"The Intercept\" won the People's Voice award for best news website at the tenth annual Webby Awards. In May 2016, \"The Intercept\" won three awards at the New York Press Club Awards For Journalism. The site was awarded in the \"special event reporting\" category for its investigative reporting on the U.S. drone program, the \"humor\" category for a series of columns by the writer Barrett Brown, and the \"documentary\" category for a short film called, \"The Surrender\"—about the former U.S. intelligence analyst Stephen Jin-Woo Kim—produced by Stephen Maing, Laura Poitras, and Peter Maass. At the September 2016 Online News Awards, \"The Intercept\" won the University of Florida Award in Investigative Data Journalism for its Drone Papers series, an investigation of secret documents detailing a covert U.S. military overseas assassination program.\n\nAt the 2017 Online News Awards, \"The Intercept\" won two awards: the first for a feature story about the FBI's efforts to infiltrate the Bundy family, and the second, an investigative data journalism award for \"Trial and Terror,\" a project documenting the people prosecuted in the U.S. for terrorism since 9/11. The same year, \"The Intercept\" won a Hillman Prize for Web Journalism for an investigative series by Jamie Kalven exposing criminality within the Chicago Police Department. The news organization also won a 2017 award for \"Outstanding Feature Story\" at the sixteenth annual Awards for Reporting on The Environment. Judges of the environmental award praised author Sharon Lerner for her piece \"The Strange Case of Tennie White,\" which they described as a \"finely written and disturbing investigation of contamination and injustice near a chemical plant in Mississippi.\"\n\nOn August 15, 2014, U.S. National Counterintelligence Executive (NCE) William Evanina confirmed that the FBI is moving forward with a probe into how classified documents were leaked to \"The Intercept\" for its article revealing details about a database of terrorism suspects, which linked some people to terrorism even if they had no known association with any terrorism group. \"It's a criminal act that has us very concerned,\" said Evanina, a former FBI special agent with a counter-terrorism specialty who was appointed NCE by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper in May 2014.\n\nIn August 2014, it was reported that members of the U.S. military had been banned from reading \"The Intercept\".\n\nErik Wemple, writing for \"The Washington Post\", noted the conspicuous refusal of \"The Intercept\" to use the term \"targeted killings\" to refer to the U.S. drone program, instead referring to the drone strikes as \"assassinations.\" Wemple included Greenwald's explanation that assassination is \"the accurate term rather than the euphemistic term that the government wants us to use\"; Greenwald further noted that \"anyone who is murdered deliberately away from a battlefield for political purposes is being assassinated.\" TechCrunch referred to the story as clear evidence of \"unabashed opposition to security hawks.\"\n\nIn January 2015, Benjamin Wittes, editor in chief of \"Lawfare\", argued that essentially, \"The Intercept\" was inviting individuals and organizations to steal documents and leak them to \"The Intercept\" by publishing a \"How to Leak to the Intercept\" guide. Wittes wrote,If I were a foreign intelligence agency, I'd be looking at this as a great way to send enticing-looking documents, maybe even real ones, that contain some nifty bits of executable code that offered visibility for me onto the activities of people with access to the Snowden materials, people who are talking to and recruiting other leakers. Or maybe I'd be drop some honey-pot files, some files that beacon their location. Or maybe I'd just use the opportunity to drop disinformation on journalists who have shown they will believe just about anything if it's disparaging of U.S. intelligence. Wittes also questioned the ability of \"The Intercept\" to protect those who leak to the online publication.\n\nIn February 2016, the site appended lengthy corrections to five stories by reporter Juan M. Thompson and retracted a sixth, about Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof, written over the previous year, focused on the African-American community. Shortly afterward, a note from editor Betsy Reed indicated that Thompson had been fired recently after his editors discovered \"a pattern of deception\" in his reporting. According to Reed, he had \"fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a Gmail account in my name\".\n\nReed apologized to readers and to those misquoted. She noted that some of Thompson's work, most of it using public sources, was verifiable. Editors alerted any downstream users of the affected stories, and promised to take similar action if further fabrication came to light.\n\nThompson suggested that the greater problem was racism in the media field. He had made up pseudonyms for some of his sources, whom he described as \"poor black people who didn't want their names in the public given the situations\" and would not have spoken with a reporter otherwise. \"[T]he journalism that covers the experiences of poor black folk and the journalism others, such as you and First Look, are used to differs drastically,\" he argued. He also claimed he had felt a need to \"exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth\" at \"The Intercept\" given incidents of racial bias he said he had witnessed there. When \"Gawker\" published his email, Reed said those allegations had not been in the version he sent her.\n\nHe was fired by \"The Intercept\" in early 2016, and according to Reed, did not cooperate with the investigation into his actions.\n\nIn early June 2017, \"The Intercept\" published a National Security Agency document that asserts Russian intelligence successfully hacked an American voter registration and poll software company, and used information culled to phish state election officials. The document was mailed from a source inside NSA, who did not reveal their identity to \"Intercept\" writers. One hour after publication, a 25-year old NSA contract employee named Reality Winner was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged under the Espionage Act of 1917.\n\nThe article bolstered public suspicion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. It also drew attention for being at odds with views held by editor Glenn Greenwald who had publicly ridiculed or dismissed allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, calling them \"radical conspiracy theories.\" Greenwald alleged that the Democratic party hyperbolized the evidence supporting collusion complaints about Trump, in order to shift the blame for Trump's election as president away from the Democratic Party.\n\nThe document explains that Russian intelligence attempted to crack the log-in information of the employees of a vendor providing voter registration software and databases for states to use with their election systems. It alleged that the Russians were successful enough that they were able to email 122 election officials, by posing as employees of the vendor.\n\nAccording to David Folkenflik of National Public Radio,An \"Intercept\" reporter shared a photo of the papers with a source, a government contractor whom he trusted, seeking to validate it. The printout included a postmark of Augusta, Ga., and microdots, a kind of computerized fingerprint. The contractor told his bosses, who informed the FBI. NSA quickly identified the leaker of the documents.\n\nVerifying the legitimacy of leaked documents is common journalism practice, as is protecting third parties who may be harmed incidentally by the leak being published. However, professional media outlets who receive documents or recordings from confidential sources do not, as a practice, share the unfiltered primary evidence with a federal agency for review or verification, as it is known that metadata and unique identifiers may be revealed that were not obvious to the journalist, and the source exposed.\n\nThe evidence chain led to the arrest of Winner, a young Air Force veteran who was working in Georgia for Pluribus International Corporation, an NSA contractor, when the document was mailed to \"The Intercept\". \"The Intercept\" has been criticized for unprofessional handling of the document, and indifference to the source's safety.\n\nFollowing the arrest of Winner, \"The Intercept\" released a statement saying it had \"no knowledge of the identity of the person who provided us with the document.\" Allegations from the FBI about Winner, it added, were \"unproven assertions and speculation designed to serve the government's agenda and as such warrant skepticism.\"\n\nNSA whistleblower John Kiriakou and Guantanamo Bay detention camp whistleblower Joseph Hickman have both accused the same reporter accused of revealing Winner's identity, Matthew Cole, of playing a role in their exposure, which, in Kiriakou's case, led to his imprisonment. \n\nOn July 11, 2017, \"The Intercept\" announced that its parent company, First Look Media, through its Press Freedom Defense Fund, would provide $50,000 in matching funds to Stand with Reality, a crowd-funding campaign to support Winner's legal defense, plus a separate grant to engage a second law firm to assist Winner's principal attorneys, Augusta-based Bell & Brigham. Additionally, wrote editor-in-chief Betsy Reed, \"First Look's counsel Baruch Weiss of the firm Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer may support the defense efforts while continuing to represent First Look's interests.\"\n\n\"Intercepted\" is a weekly podcast hosted by investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill and produced by First Look Media. The podcast uses interviews, round table discussions, and journalistic narrative to present investigative reporting, analysis, and commentary on topics such as war, national security, the media, the environment, criminal justice, government, and politics. Launched on January 25, 2017, the show often includes discussion with other writers, reporters, artists, and thinkers. It regularly features \"The Intercept\" editor and journalist Glenn Greenwald as well as senior correspondent, author, and journalist Naomi Klein. The editor-in-chief is Betsy Reed. Music for the show is created and performed by DJ Spooky.\n\nThe premier episode, on January 25, 2017, \"The Clock Strikes Thirteen, Donald Trump is President\" features an interview with Seymour Hersh, who criticizes the media's response to the alleged Russian hacking of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, calling the way the media went along with the story, \"outrageous\". Other notable guests on the show include Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Barbara Lee.\n\n\"Deconstructed\" is a podcast hosted by the British political journalist and broadcaster Mehdi Hasan and published by \"The Intercept\".\n\nIn August 2016, the site launched a Brazilian version, \"The Intercept Brasil\", edited in Portuguese, aimed at Brazilian political news, and produced by a team of Brazilian journalists. \"The Intercept Brasil\" also features translated news from the English edition.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6389844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6389844", "title": "Women's rights in Iran", "text": "Women's rights in Iran\n\nWomen's rights in Iran have changed according to the form of government ruling the state. With the rise of each regime, a series of mandates for women's rights arose, which affected a broad range of issues from voting rights to dress code.\n\nFor Iranian women, their rights and legal status have changed since the early 20th century. Women's rights in Iran are limited compared to the women in developed nations. The World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Iran 140 out of 144 countries for gender parity. Women in Iran constitute 19% of the workforce in 2017 with only 7% growth since 1990.\n\nThe legal rights of women have gone through many changes during the past three political regimes in Iran. During the Qajar, the royal dynasty that ruled Iran from the late 1800s to the early 20th century, women were more isolated as they were not engaged in politics, and their economic contribution was limited to household work. These conditions transformed to a great extent during the Pahlavi regime from 1925-1979 where women had much more freedom, but that freedom soon retracted after the Iranian revolution in 1979.\n\nDuring the Qajar and soon after the beginning of the Islamic revolution, the status of women in society was equal to second-class citizens.\n\nHistorical records dating back to the great Achaemenid Empire (2000 – 550 BCE), women in Iran have, for the most part, been subordinate to men.\n\nIran's history is commonly divided into three segments: Pre-Islamic, post-Islamic, and the modern era. Though little is known about Iran's pre-Islamic time, the recorded history starts with the Achaemenid Empire in 2000 B.C. During the rule of the Achaemenid Empire, Greek historical accounts include that women were able to participate in civic affairs; however, this participation was still limited and considered unusual to the general population. Greek historian, Herodotus, after his visit to the Achaemenian Empire, recounted that Persian men and women worked together in managing the affairs of the states and participated in public ceremony together. Royal women had access to education, were trained horse riders, and participated in official ceremonies, such as the King's birthday and Naw-ruz, the annual Persian New Year.\n\nAfter the fall of the Achaemenid Empire and the rise of Sassanid Empire, women's position in Iran degraded and their status was inferior to men. During this era, elite women veiled themselves as a form of protection from non-elite men.\n\nDuring the Qajar and soon at the beginning of the Islamic revolution “most women in Persian were second-class citizens with limited if any, rights such as to inheritance or to obtain a basic education. For example, tribal and nomadic groups (like the Kurds, Bakhtiari, Qashqai) allowed their women to interact with men to a certain extent, and even some considered polygamy and Mu’ta (Shia temporary marriage) as undesirable.”\n\nIranian women played a significant role in the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1905–11. They participated in large numbers in public affairs and held important positions in journalism and in schools and associations that flourished from 1911 to 1924. Prominent Iranian women who played a vital part in the revolution include Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi, Noor-ol-Hoda Mangeneh, Mohtaram Eskandari, Sediqeh Dowlatabadi, and Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, many educated Persian women were attracted to journalism and writing. \"Danesh\" (1907) was the first specialized journal focusing on women's issues. Later, \"Shokoufeh\", \"Nameie Banovan\", \"Alam e Nesvan\", and \"Nesvan e Vatan Khah\" were published in Tehran. Moreover, \"Nesvan e Shargh\" in Bandar Anzali, \"Jahan e Zanan\" in Mashhad, \"Dokhtaran e Iran\" in Shiraz, and \"Peik e saadat\" in Rasht addressed women's issues throughout Persia (Iran). Although the defeat of the constitutionalists (1921–25) and the consolidation of power by Reza Shah (1925–41) destroyed the women's journals and groups, the state during these years implemented social reforms such as mass education and paid employment for women. Reza Shah also began his controversial policy of \"Kashf-e-Hijab\", which banned the wearing of the Islamic hijab in public. But like other sectors of society in the years under Reza Shah's rule, women lost the right to express themselves, and dissent was repressed.\n\nIn 1925, the military commander, Reza Khan, overthrew the Qajar dynasty. In the same year, he was declared the Shah of Iran, which marked the beginning of the Pahlavi era. Iran's societal structure and the status of women began to improve after the Shah went on a visit to Turkey in 1936. The Shah was inspired by the modernization that was taking place there by the Turkish leader, Atatürk. In a speech he gave upon his return from Turkey, the former Shah of Iran said: “I am extremely delighted that women have become aware of their rights and entitlement… Now women are on their way to gain other rights in addition to the great privilege of motherhood.”\n\nAfter Reza Shah was banished to the Morris Island by the Allied powers, his son, Mohammad Reza, took over. The Shah's government began its White Revolution in 1962 and ratified essential women's rights measures, including suffrage and the Family Protection Law of 1967. The Shah's White Revolution helped to increase the legal rights of women. In 1975, this law was amended to be more heavily in favor of women, by ending extrajudicial divorce and restricting polygamy. It also raised the minimum age of marriage of girls from 13-15 to 18.\n\nWhen the Iranian Revolution started in 1977, many women protested by marching in metropolitan cities and wore chadors as a sign of protest. Women played a significant role in the success of the revolution. Their role was both praised and encouraged by the revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, who in various speeches stated:\n\n\nBecause the first Pahlavi Shah banned the use of the hijab, many women decided to show their favor for the Islamic revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, by wearing a chador, thinking that this would be the best way to show their support without having to be vocal.\n\nWomen took part in the Iranian revolution by participating in the protests. Organizations supportive of the Islamic Revolution, such as Mujahidin, welcomed women into their organization and gave women essential tasks. Ayatollah Khomeini also encouraged women to take part in the protest against the Shah.\n\nWith the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini, women's roles were limited as they were encouraged to raise large families and tend to household duties. Khomeini believed this to be the most vital role women could pursue. It was this belief that led to the closing of women's centers, childcare centers and the abolishment of family planning initiatives.\n\nAfter the passing of Ayatollah Khomeini, women put more pressure on the government to grant more rights to women. Khamenei, who followed Khomeini took a more liberal approach and enabled women's advancement by reopening the women's centers and restoring many of the laws that were abdicated after the revocation of Family Protection Laws.\n\nIn May 1997, the overwhelming majority of women voted for Mohammad Khatami, a reformist cleric who promised more political freedom. His election brought a period during which women became increasingly bold in expressing ideas, demands, and criticisms. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian human rights and women's right activist, further emboldened women's rights activists inside Iran and cemented their relationships with Iranian feminists abroad.\n\nDuring the Sixth Parliament, some of Iran's strongest advocates of women's rights emerged. Almost all of the 11 female lawmakers of the (at the time) 270-seat Majlis tried to change some of Iran's more conservative laws. However, during the elections for the Seventh Majlis, the all-male Council of Guardians banned the 11 women from running for office, and only conservative females were allowed to run. The Seventh Majlis reversed many of the laws passed by the reformist Sixth Majlis.\n\nDuring Mohammad Reza Shah's era, women were given the right to divorce or sue for divorce and also gained the right to vote. Abortion also became a right for women in cases such as rape. It was during this period that segregation laws were lifted and men and women were allowed to associate in public together.\n\nMost initiatives concerning women's rights during the Pahlavi dynasty began with the White Revolution in 1962, which eventually led to the enfranchisement of women. This enfranchisement came from the Prime Minister Asadollah Alam. Most revolutionary initiatives came with the White Revolution. A law was passed which gave women limited voting rights, allowing them the right to vote in local elections.\n\nProtests led by Ayatollah Khomeini regarding voting rights resulted in the repeal of the law. Khomeini believed that such power for women was comparable to prostitution.\n\nSince the voting rights law was repealed, women were not allowed to take part in a referendum held during the White Revolution. However, the Minister of Agriculture suggested that women's movement leaders set up a voting booth to voice their suggestions. Though their votes did not count, the high number of women votes convinced Mohammad Reza Shah to grant women voting rights soon after the referendum. In September of the same year, 1963, in the parliamentary elections, six women were elected to the parliament, and two women were appointed by the Shah to serve in the Senate.\n\nHijab is a veil worn by Muslim women when interacting with males outside of their immediate family. Before the rise of the Achaemenian empire, women were not forced to wear a veil. In 1935, Reza Shah mandated that women should no longer be veiled in public.\n\nAfter Reza Shah mandated women to appear in public unveiled in 1935, a significant number of women became isolated in their houses as they felt going outside their home with no Hijab was equivalent to being naked. Women's dependency during this period grew as they relied on others to run errands. The unveiling law did not last long. When Mohammad Reza rose to power, he abdicated this law, and the hijab became an individual decision.\n\nCompulsory Hijab was re-instated for Iranian state employees after the Islamic revolution in 1979 followed by a law for compulsory Hijab in all public spaces in 1983. On 26 November,2018 Nasrin Sotoudeh, a female political prisoner at Tehran’s Evin Prison started a hunger strike demanding the release of Farhad Meysami a doctor who is in jail for protesting compulsory hijab.\n\nZina is an Islamic legal term referring to unlawful sexual intercourse. In the Iranian penal code of 1991, extramarital sex (zina) is punishable by stoning or slashing. An entire chapter of Iranian penal code deals with punishments for extramarital sex. Another chapter details how such relations can be proved and verified in the court.\n\nAs part of the White Revolution, Mohammad Reza Shah also enacted the Family Protection Laws. These were a series of laws that included women's rights to divorce, helped to raise the marriage age for both boys and girls, and curtailed the custom of polygamy, mandating spousal consent before lawfully marrying a second wife.\n\nUnder these laws, the right of divorce for women was granted by allowing women to put an end to a marriage if they were unhappy. The law also gave the right to women to keep custody of their children. In addition, it gave women the right to an abortion under certain circumstances, such as rape and if the woman's life was at risk.\n\nIn 2008, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's administration introduced a \"family support bill\" in the parliament that would have allowed men to marry a second wife without his first wife's permission and put a tax on \"Mariyeh\" – which is seen by many women \"as a financial safety net in the event a husband leaves the marriage and is not forced to pay alimony.\" In September 2008, however, the bill for the tax was returned by Iran's judiciary to the legislative council with complaints about the polygamy and tax articles,and these were removed from the bill.\n\nDuring the Ahmadinejad administration, \"Siqeh\", or temporary marriages (that can last from 30 minutes to a lifetime), was used, especially in response to the financial demands of prenuptial agreements. The temporary marriages, enacted by \"fatwa\" in 1983 under Khomeini, are heavily criticized as a form of legalized prostitution.\n\nDivorce law in the Islamic republic of Iran was initially based upon the general rule in Shari'a law that gives men the sole right to end a marriage at any time. This is based on Article 1133 of the previous Civil Code (1928) that states: A man can divorce his wife whenever he wishes to do so.\n\nThis law in the Iranian constitution was modified in 1967 by the Family Protection Act which granted women more rights regarding divorce and established mandatory procedures regarding divorce. This also served as an amendment that made all private divorces illegal.\"\n\nMore divorce rights were given to women, including the right to apply for a divorce under specific conditions. Article 1130 of the Civil Code gave the court more power to grant a judicial divorce requested by a woman as well as providing specific circumstances in which the wife can attain power of attorney and expedite the divorce process.\n\nIn modern Iran, divorce can be obtained by both men and women, and the custody of children is given to women rather than men.\n\nIran's civil law system can be seen as very gender distinct, with numerous laws pertaining to favor men over women and few, if any, laws favoring women. Iran follows strict Islamic laws. One of the civil laws that is recognized in Iran is the legal age of puberty. In Iran, children that reach the age of puberty also gain penal responsibility, meaning that once a child has surpassed the age of puberty, he or she is legally tried as an adult. This can be seen as disadvantageous towards women, as female children reach puberty around the age of ten and boys around the age of fourteen. This means that girls as young as the age of ten can be prosecuted criminally. Punishments can vary from prison sentences to lashes and, rarely, the death penalty.\n\nLaws in Iran forces gender equality to be practically non-existent. Women continue to face mistreatment, especially by law enforcement officers. An example of this would be the mass amount of violence against women during the 2009 Iranian presidential election, where many women were arrested for voting for Mir-Hossein Mousavi. One anonymous woman recollected what happened in prison, and said that one of the prison guards told her, “I will do something you will never forget. I'll make it so you never want to leave your house again, so any time you hear my name, you will tremble.\" In the end, these women's votes were never counted. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the election by a landslide and, as a result, massive protests against this election occurred, saying that the election was a fraud. Ahmadinejad took office regardless.\n\nFemale education in Iran is a relatively recent advancement in society. Women have been allowed to attend school as of the late 19th century and have been allowed to attend college for merely 80 years. During the Qajar years, two schools were opened for girls, both of which were opened by missionaries for minority girls such as Christian, Jew, and Zoroastrian girls. Among the elite families, some provided their daughters with education through private tutors, but, for the most part, Muslim girls were denied education as the clergies feared female education would negatively impact the fabric of Islamic society. For the pious and faithful Muslim women, education was only acceptable when it was in agreement with the teachings of Islam. The first school for Muslim girls opened at the end of 19th century in 1899. Women's education began to increase by 1920 as 58 schools in Tehran provided education for nearly 3,000 girls.\n\nDuring the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah and his western development model and policies, women's education accelerated much more rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s. Before the fall of his dynasty, women's enrollment in universities was just over 30 percent.\n\nWhen Khomeini reached power in 1979, under his rule, the government began to Islamisize the Shah's westernized education system. To do this, they began purifying it to be culturally and religiously aligned with the new Islamic regime in Iran. The options for what women could study was halved, as the goal of purification of the Shah's education system was to help the new system meet the needs of the society. Women were no longer able to study the following fields: veterinary medicine, geology, agricultural sciences, animal husbandry, and natural resources. These limitations were slowly lifted through lobbying efforts. By the end of the 20th century, all the limitations were lifted, and women were able to begin studying in these various fields. However, higher education was still male dominated.\n\nEducational opportunities increased through the rule of Mohammad Khatami, who served as President of Iran from 1997-2005. Khatami viewed the home as the proper setting for Iranian women, yet did not seek to exclude women from participating in the public sphere. Noting the increasing dominance of women in higher education, Khatami stated that though the increase was concerning, he did not wish to create obstacles to reduce this participation. Khatami called for an opening of majors and specialties for women in universities and an end to the quota system, which was introduced after the Islamic revolution in Iran to put a cap on women's entrance to universities.\n\nAt the beginning of Khatami's presidency, over 95 percent of girls in Iran attended elementary school. In 1997-98, 38.2 percent of Iranian women enrolled in higher education. This number rose to 47.2 percent by 2000. As female enrollment in schooling continued to climb, the segregation of the sexes in academic specialization continued to persist through the end of the 1990s. In the 1998-99 academic year, males dominated enrollment in math-physics at 58% and technical fields with 71% of secondary school students. Women disproportionately enrolled in the humanities and the experimental sciences at 61% of the enrollment. Gender specialization continued through the university level where a majority of women studied in the fields of basic sciences, medical sciences, and arts. Agriculture, veterinary science, engineering, and humanities were pursued mostly by men. Overall, however, the decade was characterized by a three-fold increase in female enrollment in higher education.\n\nThe statistics of the Khatami presidency show the slow rise of female participation in education. Women pursuing teaching positions in higher education also made gains during this period, as women held nearly half of all assistant professorships at universities, nearly double that held a decade before. However, the number of women accepted into tenure-track and full-time professorships in 2001-02 remained low at 17.3%, which is disproportionate to the number of educated women in Iranian society.\n\nMale-dominated fields were overtaken by females as female numbers dramatically increased in the medical fields from 51% female versus 49% male.\n\nData shows that nearly 80% of Iranian women are literate, but only 21% of these women are employed. In contrast, 85% of males are literate, and 79% of them are employed. In total, 40% of educated women are unemployed.\n\nOver the past two decades, the number of women attending university institutions has multiplied. This rapid increase has caused concerns for the Iranian officials. In 2009, Iranian parliament (Majlis) questioned if they need to establish a quota for the number of women entering public colleges. The conservatives believe that the increase in women's access to higher education is contrary to Islamic values and can threaten the traditional family structure that forms the basis of Islamic society.\n\nDespite all the improvement and advancement made concerning higher education for women, there have been many ups and downs regarding this issue. On August 6, 2012, the Mehr News Agency in Iran “posted a bulletin that 36 universities in the country had excluded women from 77 fields of study\". This was part of an effort by the parliament to put a quota on women's participation in higher education.\n\nThe increase in women's enrollment in some fields is more apparent than others. For example, in 2008, 66% of students in medical sciences were women.\n\nThe writer and activist Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi founded the first school for Persian girls in 1907. In this school, Iranian women could study a variety of subjects, including history, geography, law, calculus, religion, and cooking.\n\nIranian women rights activists determined that education was a key for Iranian women and society. They argued that giving women education was best for Iran, in that the mothers would raise better sons for their country.\n\nEnrollment of 12 women into the Tehran University in 1936, marked the entry of women into university education in Iran.\n\nAs of 2006, women account for well over half of the university students in Iran and 70% of Iran's science and engineering students. Such education and social trends are increasingly viewed with alarm by the Iranian conservatives groups. A report by the Research Center of the Majlis (controlled by conservatives) warned that the large female enrollment could cause \"social disparity and economic and cultural imbalances between men and women.\"\n\nIn 1994, Ali Khamenei, Supreme leader of Iran, declared percentage of female university was 33% before Islamic Revolution but after that on 2012, became 60%.\n\nThe Iranian Revolution initiated social changes that helped more women enroll in universities. Today more than 60% of all university students in Iran are women.\n\nMany Iranian women have been influential in the sciences, such as Jaleh Amouzgar, Eliz Sanasarian, Janet Afary, and Alenush Terian. Maryam Mirzakhani won gold medals in the 1994 and 1995 International Mathematical Olympiads, and in 2014 her work on dynamics made her the first woman in the world to win the Fields medal, which is widely considered to be the most prestigious award in mathematics.\n\nIn 2001, Allameh Tabatabaii University, Tarbiat Modares University, and Azzahra University initiated a Women's Studies academic field at the Master of Arts level, and shortly thereafter Tehran University organized a similar program.\n\nDuring the Achaemenid Empire, women's contribution to the economy was through their engagement in agricultural duties, such as sowing seeds, harvesting, and tending livestock, but their primary role in society was bearing children. In rural areas and amongst poor urban families, women contributed to the economy by specializing in trades, such as making clothing and carpets.\n\nThe rate of women's participation and contribution to Iran's economy \"has been 14.7 and 14.4 in urban and rural areas respectively. According to the statistics of the 2006 census, out of the total households having a woman head of 10-year-old and over, only 14.1% in the urban and 13.9 percent in the rural areas have been employed from an economic point of view\".\n\nIran's 2007 census showed that 10% of women were actively contributing to the economy. In contrast, over 60% of men were economically active. Statistics show that of the managerial positions available, the possibility of women obtaining such a position is one-third that of men.\n\nAs of 2006, women's labor-force participation rates remained very low at 12.6% in rural areas with an overall rate of 12.5%. In contrast, the rate for men is 66.1%. This data is not truly reflective of reality as women's engagement in informal and private sectors are not included in the data. World Bank figure estimates women's participation in all sectors at 32% and 75% for men. The estimated data for women's leadership role is at 3.4% in 2006.\n\nFor a short period during the Achaemenian Empire, women rose to power due to a lack of an adult male heir. First Purandukht and later Azarmidukht were given the title king of kings and ruled the country for a year. Their reign was short-lived as the Zoroastrian priesthood was against female leadership.\n\nFor most of the Islamic era in Iran, women were not allowed to engage in state affairs. However, soon after the rise of the Safavid dynasty in the 16th century, women were allowed to contribute to state affairs. Women's position was still subordinate to men, but they were allowed to manage their personal property and participate in cultural activities.\n\nWomen gained a foothold in state affairs in the latter part of Pahlavi dynasty as they were given the right to vote. Iran's Queen Farrah Pahlavi was at the forefront of the women's movement and worked closely with the Shah to help women gain more rights in the 1960s and 1970s. It was during this period that the first woman was elected to Iran's parliament, Dr. Farrakhroo Parsay, in 1963.\n\nDuring the first decade after the revolution in the early 1990s, there were only three women in parliament among the 268 members with women occupying 1.5% of the seats in the first three parliaments. Today, there are 17 women among the 271 individuals in parliament.\n\nTherefore, women's presence doubled to 3.3% of the seats. The women in parliament have ratified a total of 35 bills concerning women's issues.\n\nWomen contributed to the development of polo in Persia 2,500 years ago. \"The queen and her ladies-in-waiting played against the emperor and his courtiers.\"\n\nWomen participate in numerous sports in Iran and have represented the country in sporting events, such as the Asian Games, Olympic games, and World Cups. An issue that has been voiced particularly in recent years has been in regard to women's participation at stadiums for men's volleyball and soccer. Efforts have been made to allow women to enter Iranian stadiums alongside men, but the proposal has not yet been approved. The ban on women entering stadiums has caused an uproar among both men and women in Iran. It has been indicated numerous times by lawmakers that women's duty is to raise children and not to attend sporting games. On 9 November 2018 Fatma Samoura Secretary General of International Federation of Football Association FIFA said she would ask Iranian government to end ban on women’s entry to sport stadiums.\n\nWomen are not allowed to ride bicycles in Iran pursuant to an Islamic fatwa issued by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader and autocrat. According to the Muslim clerics of Iran, if a man observes a woman riding a bicycle, it will lead to corruption in society with terrible consequences, including corruption that will lead to crime, sexual offenses, financial crimes, spiritual infidelity, religious disobedience, and many others.\n\n\n"}

People who identify with Xennials, Oregon Trail Generation or Generation Catalano do so because they do not feel they fit within the typical definitions of Generation X or Millennials.\n\nIn 2017, \"Xennial\" was included in Merriam-Webster's \"Words We're Watching\" section which discusses new words which are increasingly being used, but which do not yet meet criteria for a dictionary entry.\n\nThe term \"Xennials\" is a portmanteau blending the names of Generation X and the Millennials to describe individuals born during the Generation X/Millennial cusp years of the late 1970s to the early 1980s.\n\nThe term Xennial is reported to be first created and used in a September 2014 article in GOOD magazine written by Sarah Stankorb and Jed Oelbaum. Good magazine describes Xennials as \"a micro-generation that serves as a bridge between the disaffection of Gen X and the blithe optimism of Millennials\", using it to describe those born between 1977 and 1983. The term Xennials received additional attention in June 2017 following an Instagram post describing it which went viral on Facebook. Dan Woodman, an Australian sociologist, was credited by the Australian media with inventing the term, but Woodman says he did not coin the term., and the earliest traced usage is the 2014 article from Good magazine. \n\nIn 2018, Marleen Stollen writing for \"Business Insider\" described Xennials as term for people who don't feel like a Gen Xer or a Millennial. She used birth dates between 1977 and 1985 in her article to describe them.\n\nThe term \"Oregon Trail Generation\" was used by Anna Garvey in her 2015 article \"The Oregon Trail Generation: Life Before And After Mainstream Tech\", published in \"Social Media Week\" to describe those born at \"the tail end of the 70s and the start of the 80s\". It is named after the video game \"The Oregon Trail\", the Apple II version of which was played by many American GenX/Millennial cuspers in their school computer labs. Other terms, such as Xennials, Generation Catalano and The Lucky Ones were already coined and are referenced in her article.\n\n\"Slate\" defines Generation Catalano as being born from 1977 to 1981, essentially Jimmy Carter's presidency. The name is a reference to the character Jordan Catalano from the 1990s teen drama \"My So-Called Life\".\n\nMerriam-Webster includes \"Xennial\" in their Words We're Watching section, defining the term as \"a word that refers to people who were born on the cusp between Generation X and the millennials. Some consider 'xennials' to be those born between 1977 and 1983.\"\n\nMany who identify with the cusp years of Oregon Trail Generation, Xennials or Generation Catalano do so because they do not feel they fit within the typical definitions of Generation X or Millennials. Cassie McClure, writing for \"Las Cruces Sun-News,\" describes those in the Oregon Trail Generation as \"remembering a time before the digital age, but barely\". Anna Garvey describes these individuals as having \"both a healthy portion of Gen X grunge cynicism, and a dash of the unbridled optimism of Millennials\", and discusses their relationship with both analog and digital technology. Sheknows.com describes individuals born in the late 1970s and early 1980s as sharing traits with both Generation X and Millennials.\n\nAnna Garvey describes U.S members of this group as having had an \"AOL adolescence\" and as being from \"the last gasp of a time before sexting, Facebook shaming, and constant communication\". \"The Dickinson Press\" describes those born in the early 1980s as having early adulthoods which were impacted by the events of the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War.\n\nAccording to Australian sociologist, Dan Woodman, \"The theory goes that the Xennials dated, and often formed ongoing relationships, pre-social media. They usually weren't on Tinder or Grindr, for their first go at dating at least. They called up their friends and the person they wanted to ask out on a landline phone, hoping that it wasn't their intended date's parent who picked up..\" Woodman also says \"the 'Xennials' must be taken with several grains of salt. There isn't yet any strong academic evidence for the grouping, although clearly the idea resonates with a lot of people who felt left out by the usual categorizations.\"\n"}

He was the son of caliph Ali ibn Hammud, of Berber-Arab origins.\n\nHe was governor of Ceuta from 1016, a title he received from his father. After the latter's death, he refused to recognize his uncle al-Qasim al-Ma'mun as caliph. After reaching Málaga he moved to Córdoba with a Berber army. Al-Qasim abandoned the city, taking refuge in Seville; Yahya reigned until 1023, when al-Qasim took back the throne.
