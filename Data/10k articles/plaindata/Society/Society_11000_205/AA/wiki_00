He was a poet, musician, dancer, linguist and philosopher. He was born in Ajjada village, near Bobbili, presently in Balijipeta mandal of Vizianagaram district, Andhra Pradesh, India.\n\nNarayana Das was a linguist with proficiency in as many as eight languages (including Arabic and Persian), poet, philosopher, playwright, composer, dancer, actor and the creator of the unique art form, Hari Katha.\n\nNarayana Das was a scholar who had mastery over four classical languages (Sanskrit, Telugu, Arabic and Persian) and who translated from Persian and English into Sanskrit and Telugu; the only litterateur who wrote a comparative treatise on the works of Kalidas and Shakespeare; the only writer-composer who translated into Telugu and set to music Rig Vedic hymns and the only writer-composer who composed a geeta-malika comprising 90 Carnatic ragas. As a writer-composer who composed music in all the 72 Carnatic ragas he was next only to Tyagaraja.\n\nEnraptured by his rendering of the Hindusthani Bhairavi raga, Rabindranath Tagore sought to introduce the curriculum followed by Narayana Das in his music college at Visva-Bharati University.\n\nHe had mastery over several Indian and classical languages like Telugu, Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, English, Arabic and Persian. He was also a performer of Ashtavadhanam. He has written over a hundred books in Telugu, Sanskrit. His works ranged from children's literature to philosophical treatises.\n\nHis literary output was extensive. He wrote original Kavyas and Prabandhas that reflect a rare creative genius, erudition and great felicity of expression. He wrote over fifty books in Telugu, Sanskrit and Atcha-Telugu (Desyandhramu or Telugu unmixed of Sanskrit). His works included original story-poems (Kavyas and Prabndhas), Harikathas, prose works, musical works, dramas, translations, treatises in philosophy and Vedic studies and children's literature.\n\nHe felt that Edward Fitzgerald's English translations did not do justice to the Persian poet Omar Khayyam's poetry. To demonstrate his viewpoint he translated both the original quatrains of Omar Khaiyam and Edward Fitzgerald's English translation into two languages – Sanskrit and \"Atcha\" Telugu in different metres. The work entitled \"The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\" (1932) was acclaimed as a rare literary feat by the literati of his time. In a rare tribute, a leading newspaper reviewed the book as an editorial entitled \"A Monument of Scholarship\".\n\nIn another voluminous display of scholarship he compared the works of the Sanskrit dramatist Kālidāsa with those of Shakespeare. Entitled \"Nava Rasa Tarangini\" (1922) the book annotates passages consisting of the nine rasas or moods from the dramas of both the dramatists by translating them into Telugu.\n\nHis magnum opus was a two volume philosophical work entitled \"Jagadjyoti\", in which he recorded his musings on various Indian philosophies, even accommodating atheist viewpoints.\n\nHis Sanskrit works include \"Harikathamrutam\" a compilation of three Hari Kathas, \"Tarakam\" an original allegorical poem and two Shatakas \"Ramachandra Shatakam\" and \"Kashi Shatakam\". A Satakam usually consists of 100 verses written in the same prosody.\n\nHe composed a lyric, entitled \"Dasha Vidha Raga Navati Kusuma Manjari\" employing 90 ragas in the Manjari metre. Such a composition has never been attempted and is a testimony to his rare mastery over poetry and music. He set to musical notation 300-odd select ruks from the Rigveda in a work entitled \"Ruksangraham\" and taught playing them on the veena to students but also translated them as poems in Telugu.\n\nHis musical accomplishments left him peerless in his time. Maestros of the musical world honoured him with titles like \"Laya Brahma\" and \"Panchamukhi Parameshwara\" for his ability to sing to five different Talas, beat with the two arms, two feet and the head. Five different musicians used to keep time with him when he performed \"Panchamukhi\".\n\nThe literary and musical elite of his time joined to honour him with the title \"Sangita Sahitya Sarvabhauma\".\n\nFusing the sister realms of poetry, music and dance he created a new art form which he called the Harikatha. Harikatha has a divine mythological core with poetry and music as the medium. Dance and histrionics form the visual expression.\n\nThe exponent of Harikatha should be able to compose and recite extempore the objective of the performance being to entertain and educate both the layman and the erudite scholar. Having invented the vehicle, he wrote twenty one Harikathas, seventeen in Telugu, three in Sanskrit.\n\nHe was the first principal of the Maharajah's Government College of Music and Dance (Vijayarama Gana Pathasala) established by the Maharajah of Vizianagaram in 1919. The Maharajah in fact established the Music College, which was among the first few in South India, to honour the Pundit and enable enthusiasts to learn music from him. Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu the well-known Violin maestro was a lecturer in the college during the Pandit's tenure and succeeded him as principal.\n\nHe entranced Rabindranath Tagore with his rendering of \"Hindusthani Bhairavi\". Tagore sought the curriculum of the Vizianagaram Music College to be introduced in \"Shantiniketan\".\n\nA characteristic trait we notice in a number of instances in the life of Narayana Das is a compulsive urge to excel in everything he did. The conception and renunciation of 'Naa Eruka', his autobiography is an example that provides insight into his complex personality. He began writing what would have been the first autobiography in Telugu and sent the initial chapters, narrating his life story from birth to the age of about thirty, to the printers. There was a delay at the printers due to pressure of work and in the meantime another famous writer's autobiography came out. Narayana Das called off the project because of his obsessive desire to be 'second to none'. Thus was lost to the public not only an opportunity to read the great man's life story told in his own words with remarkable candour, but also his perspective of his literary output and the literary and cultural zeitgeist of his time.\n\nIn the parlance of modern behavioural sciences the term self-actualisation is defined as a fundamental tendency to maximum realisation and fulfilment of one's potential. In the case of an artiste this means he tends to write, compose or perform to satisfy an inner urge oblivious to the environment. He competes only with himself. He sets his own standards of performance and after achieving them keeps raising them to a higher level. It is a continual upward spiral.\n\nSelf-actualization was the leitmotif of Narayana Das' life in all the fields he worked in, be it literature, music or other performing arts such as Avadahanam, and Hari Katha. He brushed aside fame and fortune. For example, it was said that he did not approve of a move to nominate him for the Nobel literary prize. The philosopher in him made him decline offers to be made court musician by the Maharajah of Mysore and later by the Maharaja of Vizianagaram, instead preferring an independent life lead in the service of God.\n\nEven when he consented to head 'Shri Vijayarama Gana Pathashala', the music college the Maharajah of Vizianagaram founded for the express purpose of honouring him, he insisted that it be treated as a temple for Sri Rama and him as His servant. The only vanity he permitted himself was that he wanted to be second to none!\nhe met vivekananda in usa and taught ashtadhyayi to vivekananda\n\n"}

At present, the largest Arab community is the 250,000 people of Palestinian descent, the majority of whom (95%) are Christian (Catholic and Orthodox). Estimates place the Muslim population at about 5,000-6,000.\n\nRelatively few Arabs immigrated to Honduras during the 19th century. Under conservative General Captain José María Medina (1862-1876), the National Congress issued the first immigration law on February 26, 1866, allowing willing foreigners to reside in the country. Afterwards, the liberal reformer Dr. Marco Aurelio Soto (1876-1883) published the Political Constitution of 1876, which reflected the importance he placed on immigration for national development, including those from North America (many displaced by the aftermath of the Civil War), Europe, the Middle East and Asia, etc. The government of General Luis Bográn (1883-1891) also emphasized immigration as a means to increase the national population, develop the labor force, further exploit the country's natural resources; in Honduras he offered foreigners the opportunity to treat with an equal, a cordial welcome, security, and especially an influence on the Honduran national identity. Constantino Nini is cited as the first Arab to settle in Honduras in 1893, even before Christians were legally allowed to leave the Ottoman Empire in 1895.\n\nThe early 20th century saw a major increase in Arab immigration to Honduras following crisis in the Ottoman Empire and World War I. Since then, Arabs have been a force in Honduran economics and politics; the Arab influence on businesses and political life has arguably been stronger in Honduras than any other place in the Western Hemisphere. In the early 20th century, Gonzalo \"Chalo\" Luque noted the names of many Palestinian-Arab heads-of-household in San Pedro Sula, and Mario Posas made a similar list for the developing banana plantations near La Ceiba. In 1920, Palestinian Arabs made up just 0.5% of the Honduran population according to documents from the Ministry of Foreign Relations, and the 1935 census showed just 47 \"Turks\" and 721 Palestinians out of a total population of 960,000. (Because many immigrants had passports from the Ottoman Empire, Arab Hondurans acquired the generic nickname of \"Turcos\".) However, several researchers suggest that there had been a wave of Middle Eastern immigrants to Central America in the 1920s and 1930s; hundreds of families settled primarily in Honduras, with nearly 25,000 Arabs in San Pedro Sula alone by 1930, and over 40,000 by 1940. Many of these immigrants were well-educated, and many came from Bethlehem or surrounding villages which allowed them to easily form cohesive and supportive social networks. Fluency in English allowed early coffee grinders to establish trade relationships with Belize and North America, and by the early 20th century, Arab families owned over 40% of local businesses according to one survey.\n\nIn 1939 the Tegucigalpa Arab community organized the \"Society Union Arab Youth\" under the leadership of Gabriel Kattán and Nicolás Larach, which led to the founding of similar associations in Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Nicaragua. This organization published a weekly newspaper called \"Rumbos\" (\"Directions\") and produced an exclusive radio program for Radio HRN. In 1968, eight Arab-Honduran members of this Society purchased six acres in a suburb of San Pedro Sula where they built a swimming pool. This eventually grew into the US$15 million Arab-Honduran Social Center complex, which included some 1,600 families as club members by 2001.\n\nEstimates placed the Palestinian Arab population at between 150,000 and 200,000 at the beginning of the 21st century, a percentage second only to Chile in the Americas.\n\nDespite comprising only approximately three percent of the country's population, Arab Houndurans are major players in the country's economy and politics. Famous Arab Hondurans include:\n\n\n"}

The United States Supreme Court has stated that by assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients to make \"full and frank\" disclosures to their attorneys, who are then better able to provide candid advice and effective representation.\n\nAlthough there are minor variations, the elements necessary to establish the attorney client privilege generally are:\n\n\nThere are a number of exceptions to the privilege in most jurisdictions, chief among them:\n\nA corollary to the attorney–client privilege is the joint defense privilege, which is also called the common interest rule. The common interest rule \"serves to protect the confidentiality of communications passing from one party to another party where a joint defense or strategy has been decided upon and undertaken by the parties and their respective counsel.\"\n\nAn attorney speaking publicly in regard to a client's personal business and private affairs can be reprimanded by the bar and/or disbarred, regardless of the fact that he or she may be no longer representing the client. Discussing a client's or past client's criminal history, or otherwise, is viewed as a breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe attorney–client privilege is separate from and should not be confused with the work-product doctrine.\n\nWhen an attorney is not acting primarily as an attorney but, for instance, as a business advisor, member of the Board of Directors, or in another non-legal role, then the privilege generally does not apply.\n\nThe privilege protects the confidential communication, and not the underlying information. For instance, if a client has previously disclosed confidential information to a third party who is not an attorney, and then gives the same information to an attorney, the attorney–client privilege will still protect the communication to the attorney, but will not protect the communication with the third party.\n\nThe privilege may be waived if the confidential communications are disclosed to third parties.\n\nOther limits to the privilege may apply depending on the situation being adjudicated.\n\nThe crime-fraud exception can render the privilege moot when communications between an attorney and client are themselves used to further a crime, tort, or fraud. In \"Clark v. United States\", the US Supreme Court stated that \"A client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told.\" The crime-fraud exception also \"does\" require that the crime or fraud discussed between client and attorney be carried out to be triggered. US Courts have not yet conclusively ruled how little knowledge an attorney can have of the underlying crime or fraud before the privilege detaches and the attorney's communications or requisite testimony become admissible.\n\nLawyers may disclose confidential information relating to the retainer where they are reasonably seeking to collect payment for services rendered. This is justified on policy grounds. If lawyers were unable to disclose such information, many would undertake legal work only where payment is made in advance. This would arguably adversely affect the public's access to justice.\n\nLawyers may also breach the duty where they are defending themselves against disciplinary or legal proceedings. A client who initiates proceedings against a lawyer effectively waives rights to confidentiality. This is justified on grounds of procedural fairness—a lawyer unable to reveal information relating to the retainer would be unable to defend themselves against such action.\n\nAnother case is for the probate of a last will and testament. Previously confidential communications between the lawyer and testator may be disclosed in order to prove that a will represented the intent of the now deceased decedent. In many instances, the will, codicil, or other parts of the estate plan require explanation or interpretation through other proof (extrinsic evidence), such as the attorney's file notes or correspondence from the client.\n\nIn certain cases, the client may desire or consent to revelation of personal or family secrets only after his or her death; for example, the will may leave a legacy to a paramour or a natural child.\n\nCourts have occasionally revoked the privilege after the death of the client if it is deemed that doing so serves the client's intent, such as in the case of resolving testamentary disputes among heirs.\n\nIn the United States, communications between accountants and their clients are usually not privileged. A person who is worried about accusations of questionable accounting, such as tax evasion, may decide to work only with an attorney or only with an accountant who is also an attorney; some or all of the resulting communications may be privileged provided that all the requirements for the attorney–client privilege are met. The mere fact that the practitioner is an attorney will not create a valid attorney–client privilege with respect to a communication, for example, that involves business or accounting advice rather than legal advice.\n\nUnder Federal tax law in the United States, for communications on or after July 22, 1998, there is a limited Federally authorized accountant–client privilege that may apply to certain communications with non–attorneys.\n\nIf a case arises in the federal court system, the federal court will apply Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to determine whether to apply the privilege law of the relevant state or federal common law. If the case is brought to the federal court under diversity jurisdiction, the law of the relevant state will be used to apply the privilege. If the case involves a federal question, the federal court will apply the federal common law of attorney–client privilege; however, Rule 501 grants flexibility to the federal courts, allowing them to construe the privilege \"in light of experience and reason\".\n\n"}
{"id": "44749842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44749842", "title": "Belarusian Argentines", "text": "Belarusian Argentines\n\nBelarusian Argentines (, , ) — a part of the Belarusian diaspora that consists of the Belarusians who emigrated to Argentina and their descendants. The community was formed in the 20th century, now it accounts for 7,000 people and about 50,000 descendants. The largest Belarusian community in Latin America is in Argentina.\n\nPresumably the first emigrants from Belarus came to Argentina after French invasion of Russia (1812). A part of the Belarusians, who fought for Napoleon in the Lithuanian military unit (under the command of Knishevich and Rynkevich Generals), moved to France after the defeat. There were Argentinian agencies at that time that recruited military and civilian specialists. Some Poles and Belarusians further moved to Argentina to join the Argentinian army.\n\nThe theme of emigration from Belarus to Argentina before the World War I is insufficiently explored. The statistical immigration service in Argentina is recorded only since 1857. From that time and until 1915 161,422 people left the Russian Empire for Argentina. However, this statistic data does not contain any information concerning the ethnicity, only the country of origin. This is known for now that most of the emigrants were Jewish.\n\nDuring the interwar period only the emigration from West Belarus was possible.\nThe emigration included mostly single men-peasants who were traveling to work, although there were also soldiers who fought together with Stanislav Bulak-Balakhovich. The number of Belarusians who emigrated during this period accounts for about 30,000.\n\nAs the Polish consulate was not interested in the problems of Belarusians, emigrants began to create associations. In 1934 \"The Belarusian Cultural and Educational Association\" was founded, in 1937 — \"Belarusian Association \"Culture\"\", and \"Iwan Luckiewicz Belarusian Library\" in 1938 — \"The Belarusian Cultural Association \"Belavezh\"\" (\"Yakub Kolas\" after the war). In 1939 the combination of all these unions created the \"Belarusian Federation of associations in Argentina\", to which later two more new associations joined. A theatrical group was organized there under the library, the group staged performances on the local scene and in neighboring Uruguay.\n\nWhen in 1939 Poland was invaded by Germany 1,140 former Polish citizens (Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews) volunteered for the Polish army.\n\nIn 1945 the Soviet Embassy in Uruguay was opened, and in 1946 — in Argentina. Soviet diplomats called the former citizens of the Western Ukraine and Western Belarus to take the old Polish passport in return for Soviet documents, according to which these people were promised to be taken back home. Many emigrants believed that Soviet propaganda. The fact was that those people were leaving Second Polish Republic and never lived under the Soviet regime, that was why they had idealistic idea about the Soviet Union. In addition there was a kind of euphoria associated with the end of the war and the victory of the Soviet Union in it. Moreover, part of old emigrants felt animosity towards new refugees from the post-war Soviet Union.\nBy 1950 the Belarusian community in Argentina reached its high point, there lived more than 30,000 Belarusians at that time.\n\nIn 1949 \"Slavic Union in Argentina\" — pro-communist Slavic organization created in 1941 and supported by the Soviet Union — increased its activities. The members of the \"Union\" held their demonstration, carried out provocations and organized assaults on the members of other Slavic national organizations. 14 members of the \"Union\" were later deported by the Argentine authorities to their homeland. Meanwhile, under the influence of the Soviet embassy propaganda Belarusian associations switched to the communist ideas. Under President Juan Perón however persecution of communists started and all pro-communist associations were prohibited.\nLater Soviet international societies emerged, they combined all the Soviet nations and people sympathetic with the Soviet regime. Such organizations were often called \"cultural-sports clubs\". The work of such organizations was periodically cut short as before 1983 there were military juntas that ruled in Argentina intermittently.\n\nIn 1955 the \"amnesty law\" was enacted in the Soviet Union, according to the law the citizens of interwar Poland were allowed to return to the Soviet Union. Around 2,000 Belarusians have taken the advantage of this opportunity, but about 200 of them came back to Argentina in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2010 \"Kastus Kalinouski Belarusian Cultural Center\" was opened in Llavallol (Greater Buenos Aires).\n\n"}

Illegal drug trade, human trafficking, murder, corruption and domestic violence remain significant concerns. The Philippines has a high rate of murder cases, which is the highest in Southeast Asia as of 2014. Most major cities are plagued with high prevalence of crimes.\n\nOrganized crime in the Philippines can be linked to certain families or barkadas (groups) who perpetrate crimes ranging from extortion, sale of illegal narcotics and loan sharking to robbery, kidnapping, and murder-for-hire.\n\nIllegal drug trade is common all around the Philippines, and is a major concern. Methamphetamine (\"shabu\") and marijuana (\"weeds\" or \"damo\"), are the most common drugs accounting most drug-related arrests. Most of the illegal drug trade involved members of large Chinese triad groups operating in the Philippines, owing to its location on drug smuggling routes.\n\nPetty crime, which includes pick-pocketing, is a problem in the Philippines. It takes place usually in locations with many people, ranging from shopping hubs to churches. Traveling alone to withdraw cash after dark is a risk, especially for foreigners.\n\nViolent crime is high in the country; foreigners are usually the victims. As many Filipinos are stricken with poverty, one alternative they take is to kidnap others for money.\n\nIn 2014, the Philippines has a murder rate of 9.84 per 100,000 people, with a number of 9,784 recorded cases. The country also has the highest rate of murder cases in Southeast Asia in 2013, with a rate of 8.8, followed by Thailand.

Nevertheless, enforcement is reported to be inconsistent.\n\nProstitution in the Philippines is illegal. It is a serious crime with penalties ranging up to life imprisonment for those involved in trafficking. It is covered by the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act. prostitution is still sometimes illegally available through brothels (also known as \"casa\"), bars, karaoke bars, massage parlors, street walkers and escort services. , one source estimates that there are 800,000 women working as prostitutes in the Philippines, with some of them believed to be underage. While victims are largely female, and according to the current Revised Penal Code, there are in fact a small minority of them who are male.\n\nCorruption is a great problem in the Philippines.

The ensuing scandal led to him receiving criticism and ridicule in the media, and eventually Spitzer resigned as Governor a week later on March 17. \n\nThe investigation of Spitzer was initiated after North Fork Bank reported the suspicious transactions to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, which was enhanced by Patriot Act provisions, enacted to combat terrorist activity such as money laundering. Spitzer had at least seven liaisons with prostitutes from the agency over six months, and paid more than $15,000 for their services. Federal agents had him under surveillance twice in 2008. According to published reports, investigators believe Spitzer paid up to $80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years – first while he was attorney general, and later as governor.\nGovernor Spitzer, referred to as \"Client 9\" in an affidavit filed in US Federal Court, arranged to meet at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington on February 13, 2008 with a prostitute named \"Kristen\". \"Kristen\" was later identified as 22-year-old Ashley Dupré. She intended to travel from New York City for the planned tryst and Spitzer agreed in advance that he \"would be paying for everything—train tickets, cab fare from the hotel and back, mini-bar or room service, travel time and hotel\". After the meeting on February 13, 2008, Spitzer paid her $4,300 in cash. The payment included $1,100 as a deposit with the agency toward future services.\nRoom 871 at the Mayflower Hotel was booked under the name George Fox, a pseudonym that was allegedly the name of his close friend, a hedge fund investor. Some of this information came to light from a federal wiretap.\nAccording to \"Newsday\", Spitzer wanted to transfer more than $10,000 to a front company for the prostitution ring. However, he broke up the transactions into smaller slices due to federal law requiring the reporting of any transfer of $10,000 or more. When he tried to get his name taken off the wires, the bank refused, saying that the money had already been wired out and that it would be improper to do so in any case. The IRS Criminal Investigation Division then began a probe, initially fearing that Spitzer was the victim of either extortion or identity theft.\nNorth Fork's report in July 2007 went largely unnoticed until HSBC filed a report in the fall that the transactions were going to QAT International and QAT Consulting Group, which were offshore shell companies operating as a front for the Emperors Club VIP.\n\nLater, the IRS contacted the FBI to investigate possible political corruption. The investigation led federal authorities to link the money transfers to the Emperors Club. Prosecutors charged the four people operating the escort service with violations of the Mann Act a week prior to the revelations of Spitzer's involvement. On November 19, 2007, Republican operative Roger Stone sent a letter to the FBI saying that Spitzer \"used the service of high-priced call girls\" while in Florida. Stone provided detail saying that Spitzer wore calf-length black socks while having sex.\n\n\"I cannot allow for my private failings to disrupt the people's work,\" Spitzer said at a news conference in New York City. \"Over the course of my public life, I have insisted – I believe correctly – that people take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning from the office of governor.\"\n\nIn November 2008, the Department of Justice declined to prosecute Spitzer for violating the Mann Act.\n\nAfter Spitzer's initial press conference, New York State Assembly Republican Minority Leader James Tedisco and Republican New York Congressman Peter King separately called for his resignation. Tedisco later announced that he would initiate impeachment proceedings in the State Assembly if Spitzer did not resign. Spitzer's office and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York declined to comment, except to say that \"There is no agreement between this office and Gov. Eliot Spitzer, relating to his resignation or any other matter.\"\n\nThe real George Fox, who is a close friend and campaign donor of Spitzer, issued a statement denying any connection to the scandal beyond the unauthorized use of his name. He said that he was \"disappointed and distressed\" that Spitzer had used his name as an alias, and confirmed that Spitzer privately apologized to him.\n\nAccording to Nell Minow, a corporate-governance expert, Wall Street reaction to the scandal has been largely positive, due to a general dislike of Spitzer amongst investment professionals. Governor Spitzer made his rise to victory in New York City politics promising \"ethics and integrity to be the hallmarks of [his] administration.\" He had prosecuted several prostitution rings in his career, and his connection with a prostitution ring was felt as a betrayal by some women's rights and anti-human trafficking groups that had previously worked with him.\n\nIn an editorial reflecting on the scandal, political writer Martha Nussbaum wrote \"Spitzer's offense was an offense against his family. It was not an offense against the public. If he broke any laws, these are laws that never should have existed and that have been repudiated by sensible nations.\"\n\n\"Kristen\", 22, was an aspiring pop recording artist living in Manhattan whose professional stage name is Ashley Dupré. She was just one of the escorts that Spitzer had liaisons with, but she gained significant media attention following the scandal. After the news broke, she responded that she didn't \"want to be thought of as a monster,\" and that it had been a \"difficult\" and \"complicated\" time for her. On March 15, the \"New York Post\" published an extensive photo shoot showing Dupré in provocative poses. By late October 2008, Dupré's profile on MySpace.com had received nearly 12 million page views. As a result of the media attention following the scandal, Dupré was offered $1 million by \"Hustler\" to pose nude for the magazine, and received unofficial offers from \"Penthouse\", among others. She eventually agreed to pose for \"Playboy\" in the May 2010 issue.\n\nSpitzer announced on March 12, 2008 that he would resign his post as Governor effective noon on March 17 amid threats of his impeachment by state lawmakers.\nLt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded him on March 17, 2008. By resigning, Spitzer lost his status as a superdelegate in the 2008 Democratic nomination for President, depriving Hillary Clinton, whom he supported, of a superdelegate vote. This also reduced the total number of superdelegate votes available. Spitzer discussed his status as a superdelegate on \"The Colbert Report\" on February 12, 2008, the day before Spitzer met his escort at the Mayflower Hotel.\n\nKristin M. Davis, a competing madam who was involved in the scandal, served four months of jail time on Rikers Island as a result of the scandal, and later announced a run for Spitzer's old seat in the New York gubernatorial election, 2010. Davis finished in last place among those on the ballot.\n\nOverseas, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster was a high-profile casualty of the scandal when Emperors Club prostitutes alleged that he had been a client. The allegations were followed by Grosvenor stepping down in March 2007 as Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Reserves and Cadets) in the British Ministry of Defence, a position he had held for four years.\n\nBoth Spitzer and Davis ran in the 2013 election to become the New York City Comptroller. There was some debate as to whether or not Spitzer's name recognition would help him in the election. Spitzer lost.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4045584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4045584", "title": "Elizabethan Club", "text": "Elizabethan Club\n\nThe Elizabethan Club is a social club at Yale University named for Queen Elizabeth I and her era. Its profile and members tend toward a literary disposition, and conversation is one of the Club's chief purposes.\n\nThe Elizabethan Club's collection of 16th and 17th Century books and artifacts include Shakespearean folios and quartos, first editions of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\", and Francis Bacon's \"Essayes\", all locked in the Club's famous vault. The collection is only available for inspection at certain times, or to researchers upon request at Yale's Beinecke Library. Tea is served daily during the semester and members may invite guests on specified days. The Club accepts female and male undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff.\n\n The Club was founded in 1911 by Alexander Smith Cochran, a member of the Yale Class of 1896 and Wolf's Head Society. As an undergraduate he had regretted the lack of a congenial atmosphere in which to discuss literature and the arts with classmates and faculty. In 1910 he began to assemble a small but exceptional collection of first and early editions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean plays that he had studied with William Lyon Phelps, and in 1911 he offered the collection to Yale as the central point of interest for a club where conversation – and tea — would be available every afternoon. Mr. Cochran also provided a Clubhouse, with quarters for a resident steward, and a generous endowment of $100,000. His portrait hangs above the fireplace in the Vault Room, and his birthday (28 February) is marked by an annual Founder’s Dinner. The life portrait of the \"Virgine Queene\" in the Tea Room, attributed to Federico Zuccari, came with the founder’s original gift. Began during the literary renaissance at the university between 1909 and 1920, the club attracted such book collectors as Phelps, Chauncey Brewster Tinker, and John Berdan.\n\nMr. Cochran’s gift of 141 folios and quartos includes, among other important volumes, the first four Shakespeare Folios, one of the three known copies of the 1604 Hamlet, and the copy of Ben Jonson’s Works (1616) inscribed by the author to his friend Francis Young. Over the years additional volumes of equal importance, such as first or early quartos of all the major dramatists, have been acquired by gift and purchase, and the entire collection now numbers around 300 volumes. A catalogue of this collection, \"The Elizabethan Club of Yale University and Its Library\", prepared by Yale's Stephen Parks, was published in 1986 and considerably expanded in a 2011 edition. The club vault also holds a sample of 16th Century documents, manuscripts (for example, a letter of condolence from Queen Elizabeth to her friend Lady Southwell, 15 October 1598) and medals (one celebrating the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588), as well as various artefacts (a lock of Byron’s hair; a snuff box carved from a mulberry tree planted by Shakespeare at New Place, his home at Stratford; and a guest book signed by many of the Club's visitors).\n\nDocuments relating to the club's organization and activities, including a tradition of formal correspondence written in Latin to the Signet Society at Harvard, are viewable at the online Yale Manuscripts and Archives Collection:\n\nThe club is dedicated to conversation, tea, the art of the book, and literature, focused on—but not exclusively of—the Elizabethan era. During the academic year the Clubhouse is open daily for the use of its members from 8 in the morning until 10 in the evening. Tea is served every afternoon during termtime from 4 until 6. A 1920 observer noted among \"certain hopeful signs of the times, current British and American periodicals are neatly lined up on tables, configurations of other little tables, sofas and chairs provide many nooks for quiet discussion or reading, and upstairs even includes a room dedicated almost entirely to archives of \"Punch\", the former English magazine of humor and satire. Outside, the club has a deep back garden with a pavilion, understated elegant plantings, and featuring a bust of the Bard himself, to facilitate the enjoyments of finger sandwiches, cookies and croquet.\"\n\nFrom time to time, the Club sponsors special events such as Club Nights with a speaker and discussion; seasonal parties and teas; and an annual lecture honoring Maynard Mack (1909-2001), former president of the Club, longtime faculty member and illustrious Shakespeare scholar. Mack lecturers have included Joanne Akalaitis, John Barton, Tony Church, Lisa Harrow, Michael Kahn, Mark Lamos, Carey Perloff, Michael Billington and Sam Waterston.\n\nThe club also has underwritten the production of a small series of books, published by the Yale University Press. Indeed, publishing specialized works relating to the Club's mission has been a practice dating back to its early years.\n\nMembership in the Elizabethan Club, by invitation only, includes undergraduates (15 members are elected per class year; however, freshmen are not admitted; accordingly there are at most 45 current undergraduates at any time), graduate students, University staff, and faculty. The affairs of the Club are managed by a self-perpetuating Board of Incorporators (6 members of the University) that meets twice a year in October and May and by an elected Board of Governors that meets monthly. It is not a 'final society,' in that membership in another Yale secret society, association or club is not a bar to also having club membership.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "508257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=508257", "title": "Food distribution", "text": "Food distribution\n\nFood distribution is a process in which a general population is supplied with food. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) considers food distribution as a subset of the food system. The process and methodology behind food distribution varies by location. Food distribution has been a defining characteristic of human behavior in all societies, and recordings of food distribution date back for thousands of years.\n\nOne clear and defined documentation of historical food distribution comes from the Roman Republic and Empire. Many Roman rulers and emperors sought to determine the best method of distributing food throughout the Mediterranean, and as the demands of the Roman people changed in time, so too did their leaders’ plans. In the few centuries after the death of Christ, the \"annona\" became a prominent aspect in Roman food distribution. As the Empire expanded and the accessibility to certain foods changed, the demand for grain and wine drastically increased, and became a defining aspect of Roman food culture.\n\nSocieties prominent after the fall of the Romans continued to deal with the ever-present dilemma of food distribution. The distribution systems of the United States and Latin America have developed in unique ways, and faced different problems in the past century. The United States' food distribution system is vast in size and strength, and is dominated by corporations and industry. Current methods of food distribution in the US rely on the country's advanced network of infrastructure and transportation. In less developed parts of the world like Latin America, food distribution differs from the US.\n\nThere are a multitude of risk factors that can affect food distribution. War, economic failure, political problems, and weather conditions all play a role in determining the efficiency of any food system. Two recent examples of war and economic failure impacting food distribution includes the decline of food distribution in Japan during World War II and food recession in Sub-Saharan Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In both cases, food distribution was hindered and the population in these areas consequently suffered.\n\nSpecial organizations exist today to prevent any total collapses in food distribution, assist in developing food distribution and food systems in underdeveloped areas, and respond to food distribution crises. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays a key role in facilitating the growth of food distribution systems all over the world. A mixture of federal, non-profit, and volunteer organizations function in the United States to safeguard the well-being of the US food distribution system. The American Red Cross is one key example of a volunteer organization is the US that has an international presence.\n\nThe traditional Roman diet consisted of grain, fruits, olive oil, meat and wine. Of all these, grain was extremely important to the Roman people. During Rome's height, it is estimated that the city itself needed 150,000 tons of grain and millions of liters of water and wine every year to survive. It was traditionally the responsibility of the Roman government to guarantee that there was enough food for distribution among the people. In times of shortages, bad harvests, or interference by pirates, the government made sure to fulfill its obligation to food distribution. Officials would sometimes buy food themselves and then sell it back to the people at little to no cost. When Rome eventually established its Empire, foreign lands would send taxes in grain to Rome, which helped decrease the chance of a food distribution crisis.\n\nThe first indication of a collective, organized food distribution system within the Roman Republic comes from the \"annona\". Originally meaning \"yearly return\", the \"annona\" became the administrative term for governmental bread and grain distribution. Over time, \"annona\" came to represent the distribution of all pertinent foods in the Roman diet. The \"annona\" was originally organized between 500 and 50 BCE, and gained increasing influence in the centuries to come. The practice of specifically distributing grain to the plebeian class, known as \"frumentationes\", gained prominence around 120 BCE and supplemented the efforts of the \"annona\" to feed the Roman people. Emperor Augustus officially changed the \"annona\" system between 8 and 14 CE. He established the position of \"praefectus annonae\", Prefect of the Annona. Up to this point in time, the \"annona\" was handled by local government officials called aediles. Augustus’ Prefect of the \"Annona\" oversaw all transportation, weighing, inspection, and storing of state foods.\n\nThe physical distribution of foods throughout the Roman Empire varied by location and type of food. Some foods were shipped by boat and then distributed once they reached port. Others, specifically meat, were transported by land and brought into urban areas. Special regulations were put in place for the distribution of olive oil, as the Empire made contracts with olive oil producers all over the Mediterranean. Free daily distributions of olive oil were enacted by Emperor Severus during his reign from 192 to 211 CE. His distribution policy lasted for at least a few centuries, but scholars are unsure if the policy continued thereafter. Wine was not as freely distributed as olive oil, but was sold for a very low price starting around 300 CE.\n\nThe United States' food distribution system has experienced major changes in the past hundred years. Food distribution primarily relied on small, local farms in the 1940s, but quickly grew to become a large business in the 1960s. Three economic advances that allowed for the growth in food distribution between 1910 and 1960 were the establishment of chain stores, retail cooperatives, and supermarkets.\n\nChain stores did not become popular in the United States until the end of World War I. It was reported in 1929 that chain stores accounted for 39% of all grocery sales in the United States. Chain stores' success is related to their ability to undersell smaller distributors. An anti-chain movement arose in response to the success of the chain stores during the Great Depression, but caused little detriment to the success and profitability of the chains.\n\nAnother response to the success of the chain stores was the development of retail cooperatives. These organizations were founded by groups of individual food distributors who saw the benefits of using chain-style pricing. Retail cooperatives accounted for 7% to 8% of the food market in 1930, and an increase in their popularity with independent food distributors rose retail cooperative's market share to 13% by 1958.\n\nThe third and final change to US food distribution in the first half of the 20th century involved the establishment of supermarkets. The Ford Motor Company performed the first experiment regarding the profitability of large-scale supermarkets after the end of World War I. Supermarkets officially began gaining prominence in the 1930s and steadily continued their growth into the post-WWII era.\n\nModern food distribution in the United States is a result of continued growth since the 1960s. In an increasingly connected world, food distribution efforts in the US reach from coast to coast. A network of infrastructure, warehouses, factories, and commercial retailers comprise the bulk of US food distribution. It is estimated that food served in the United States may travel close to 1,500 miles between growers and consumers. While many products, specifically meat and grain, are distributed in different fashions, there are common trends to the distribution of most modern foods. An increase in the use of technology for farming has transformed the small local farm of the 1940s in to large production facilities. Several federal agencies, such as the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration, manage and sustain the productivity of the US food distribution system.\n\nFood distribution in Latin America is mainly dominated by large distributors and chains. Efforts have been made to compete with the industrialization of the food distribution system through the establishment of four types of organizations: consumer purchasing organizations, consumer cooperatives, voluntary chains, and retailer purchasing associations. Consumer purchasing organizations are groups of families who buy food together. The benefits of joining one of these organizations are the reduced cost and improved variety in diet that comes from purchasing food with other families. Consumer cooperatives differ from consumer purchasing organizations in that they are constituted by groups of individuals who work together to secure high quality food for low prices. The cooperatives are analogous to a food union that actively works to secure the rights of its consumers. Voluntary chains are organizations of privately owned retailers and food wholesalers who operate as one economic body. These groups form contracts to work under, but are economically independent of one another. Retailer purchasing organizations are groups of retailers who purchase products as though they were a single buyer. Members within these organizations are all involved in the purchasing of goods, but do not form contracts.\n\nProminent risk factors that can affect the food distribution within a society include war, economic failure, political instability, and weather conditions. Each of these factors affects individual groups of people differently, but all share the common attribute of being detrimental to local food distribution and food systems. Two prominent examples of risk factors' negative effect on a society's food distribution system are the situation in Japan during World War II and Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nJapanese food distribution drastically decreased from the effects of World War Two and the country's economic shortcomings. The need for food during the 1920s and 1930s rose drastically as Japan's population and average lifestyle increased. Japan was importing large amounts of rice, sugar, soybeans, and wheat from its colonies by 1935, and had a dependence on colonial possessions to distribute food to her people. 95% of Japanese rice between 1936 and 1938, just a few years before major conflict arose with the United States, was imported from its colonies in Korea and Formosa. Only 2% of Japan's rice came from foreign countries.\n\nAs war engulfed Japan after 1941, food distribution efforts began to suffer. Japan lost a tremendous amount of cargo ships and was surrounded by an effective US blockade for most of the war. Imports were down, which cut off Japan from its primary source of food. Rationing programs, ran by Japan's Central Foodstuff Corporation and Local Foodstuff Corporations, were an attempt to distribute food equally among the general population. Changes in tax collection and price control were also created to feed Japan, but these measures ultimately did not supply the Japanese people with enough food for survival. The average ration allowance consisted of a flour mixture which was often unhealthy and barely edible. Normal consumers age 16 to 60 received an average 330 g of ration per day in May 1943, and the situation only became more desperate as the war progressed. Rationing programs were reduced even further in July 1945, just before the war's end.\n\nIn Sub-Sharan Africa, the food distribution crisis of the 1970s and 1980s was a result of a multitude of food distribution risk factors including political problems, economic failures, and weather conditions. The heart of the political problems and economic failures affecting food distribution included poor agricultural pricing and a lack of state involvement with rural development. Some of the political problems can be traced back to the colonial period. Colonial policy supported the exportation of goods, even if it meant decreasing the amount of food for the local economy. Components of these colonial policies continued to be used after African countries gained their freedom from European nations. The usage of these failed policies caused malignant consequences on the economic situation of the peasant class, including the exploitation of peasant agriculture and in removal of peasants from their land. The weather and environmental issues regarding the Sub-Saharan African food distribution crisis also have roots in failed colonial policy. Labor migration cycles used during colonial times were ecologically damaging to the local environment and failed to create new areas for growing crops. As a result, desertification and a loss of soil fertility hurt the local agricultural sector, which then in turn negatively affected food distribution.\n\nOne of the largest organizations working to avoiding food distribution crises on the global stage in the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The FAO is a branch of the United Nations, and actively works to improve food distribution in countries that need support\n\nSeveral different organizations exist to mitigate and respond to food distribution crises in the United States. Prominent contributors to large-scale food distribution effort in the US include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Salvation Army. FEMA and the USDA work together during food distribution crises to coordinate the procurement and transportation of nonperishable food, water, and other resources to afflicted areas. The Salvation Army often receives federal supplies from FEMA and the USDA, and then works on the local level to distribute necessary goods. All food given to civilians during a crisis is typically distributed at mass emergency feeding stations.\n\nGroups like FEMA, the USDA, and the Salvation Army could not operate without help from individuals and small nonprofit groups. Prominent contributors to local food disaster efforts include groups like Emergency Communities and the American Rainbow Rapid Response (ARRR). These organizations typically focus on supplying rural and lower income areas that do not receive priority from large food distribution groups during a crisis.\n\nAnother group that works out of the United States is the American Red Cross. The American Red Cross is part of the International Red Cross, and 95% of all workers within the American Red Cross are volunteers. In the case of all crises, whether food related or not, the American Red Cross in engaged in relieving disaster victims. The Red Cross coordinates with local communities to provide essentials such as food, water, and hot meals for those in need during a crisis.\n\n"}

{"id": "92903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92903", "title": "Ghetto", "text": "Ghetto\n\nA ghetto () is a part of a city in which members of a minority group live, typically as a result of social, legal, or economic pressure. The term may have originally been used in Venice to describe the part of the city to which Jews were restricted and segregated. However, early societies may have formed their own versions of the same structure; words resembling \"ghetto\" appear in the Hebrew, Yiddish, Italian, Germanic, Old French, and Latin languages. Ghettos in many cities have also been nicknamed \"the hood\", colloquial slang for neighborhood. Versions of ghettos appear across the world, each with their own names, classifications, and groupings of people.\n\nThe word \"ghetto\" comes from the Jewish area of Venice, the Venetian Ghetto in Cannaregio, traced to a special use of Venetian \"getto\", or \"foundry\" (there was one near the site of that city's ghetto in 1516). By 1899 the term had been extended to crowded urban quarters of other minority groups. \n\nThe etymology of the word is uncertain, as there is no agreement among etymologists about the origins of the Venetian language term. Theories include that it comes from the above-mentioned Venetian ghèto (foundry); from Hebrew \"get\" (\"bill of divorce\", \"deed of separation\"), from the Yiddish \"gehektes\" (enclosed), from Latin \"Giudaicetum\", (Jewish), from the Italian \"borghetto\" (little town) \"small section of a town\" (diminutive of \"borgo\", which is of Germanic origin; see \"borough\"), from the Old French \"guect\" (guard). Another possibility is a form of \"Egitto\" (\"Egypt\"), from Latin \"Aegyptus\", possibly in memory of exile.\n\nAmong the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, are various suburbs inhabited by various ethnic groups on a large scale, examples include: Bankstown with Arabs, Leichhardt with Italians, Earlwood with Greeks and Redfern with Aborigines. Most of these suburbs, such as Leichhardt, have received their Italian identity as a result of it being a popular immigration hotspot, others such as Redfern, have received their Indigenous identity via designated housing during a period of discrimination which drew in a large population of the designated ethnic group, most of them being impoverished. \n\nIn Northern Ireland, towns and cities have long been segregated along ethnic, religious and political lines. Northern Ireland's two main communities are its Irish nationalist-republican community (who mainly self-identify as Irish or Catholic) and its unionist-loyalist community (who mainly self-identify as British or Protestant). Ghettos emerged in Belfast during the riots that accompanied the Irish War of Independence. For safety, people fled to areas where their community was the majority.\n\nMany more ghettos emerged after the 1969 riots and beginning of the \"Troubles\". In August 1969 the British Army was deployed to restore order and separate the two sides. The government built barriers called \"peace lines\". Many of the ghettos came under the control of paramilitaries such as the (republican) Provisional Irish Republican Army and the (loyalist) Ulster Defence Association. One of the most notable ghettos was Free Derry.\n\nThe existence of ethnic enclaves in the United Kingdom is controversial. Southall Broadway, a predominantly Asian area in London, where less than 12 percent of the population is white, has been cited as an example of a 'ghetto', but in reality the area is home to a number of different ethnic groups and religious groups. Analysis of data from Census 2001 revealed that only two wards in England and Wales, both in Birmingham, had one dominant non-white ethnic group comprising more than two-thirds of the local population, but there were 20 wards where whites were a minority making up less than a third of the local population. By 2001, two London boroughs – Newham and Brent – had 'minority majority' populations, and most parts of the city tend to have a diverse population.\n\nDenmark is the only country to officially use the word 'ghetto' to denote certain residential areas. The legal designation is applied to areas based on the residents' income levels, employment status, education levels, criminal convictions and 'non-Western' ethnic background. In 2017, the population of Denmark was 5.7 million, of which 8.7% were non-Western immigrants or their descendants. The population proportion of 'ghetto residents' with non-Western background was 66.5%. Since 2010, the Danish Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing publishes the \"ghettolisten\" (The list of ghettos) which in 2018 consists of 25 areas. In his New Year Speech for 2018, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced his government's intention to \"end the existence of parallel societies and ghettos by 2030\". The government has since proposed measures to solve the issue of integration which include policies like 30 hours of obligatory daycare per week for 'ghetto children' starting age 1, lowering social welfare for ghetto residents, incentives for reducing unemployment, demolition and rebuilding of certain tenements, doubling punishment for certain crimes like theft and vandalism in the ghettos, rights for landlords to refuse housing to convicts, etc. While some proposals like restricting 'ghetto children' to their homes after 8 p.m. have been rejected for being too radical, most of the 22 proposals have been agreed upon by a parliamentary majority. The policies have been criticized for undercutting 'equality before law' and for portraying immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants, in a bad light.\n\nIn France, a \"banlieue\" () is a suburb of a large city. Banlieues are divided into autonomous administrative entities and do not constitute part of the city proper. For instance, 80% of the inhabitants of the Paris area live outside the city of Paris. Like the city centre, suburbs may be rich, middle-class or poor—Versailles, Le Vésinet, Maisons-Laffitte and Neuilly-sur-Seine are affluent banlieues of Paris, while Clichy-sous-Bois, Bondy and Corbeil-Essonnes are less so. However, since the 1970s, \"banlieues\" increasingly means, in French of France, low-income housing projects (HLMs) in which mainly foreign immigrants and French of foreign descent reside, often in perceived poverty traps.\n\nA Jewish quarter is the area of a city traditionally inhabited by Jews in the diaspora. Jewish quarters, like the Jewish ghettos in Europe, were often the outgrowths of segregated ghettos instituted by the surrounding authorities. A Yiddish term for a Jewish quarter or neighborhood is \"Di yiddishe gas\" ( ), or \"The Jewish street\". Many European and Middle Eastern cities once had a historical Jewish quarter.\n\nJewish ghettos in Europe existed because Jews were viewed as alien. As a result, Jews were placed under strict regulations throughout many European cities. The character of ghettos has varied through times.\n\nIn some cases, the ghetto was a Jewish quarter with a relatively affluent population (for instance the Jewish ghetto in Venice). In other cases, ghettos were places of terrible poverty and during periods of population growth, ghettos (as that of Rome), had narrow streets and tall, crowded houses. Residents had their own justice system.\n\nDuring World War II, ghettos were established by the Nazis to confine Jews and Romani people into tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe. The Nazis most often referred to these areas in documents and signage at their entrances as \"Jewish quarter\". These Nazi ghettos sometimes coincided with traditional Jewish ghettos and Jewish quarters, but not always. On June 21, 1943, Heinrich Himmler issued a decree ordering the dissolution of all ghettos in the East and their transformation into Nazi concentration camps.\n\nA \"mellah\" (Arabic ملاح, probably from the word ملح, Arabic for \"salt\") is a walled Jewish quarter of a city in Morocco, an analogue of the European ghetto. Jewish populations were confined to \"mellahs\" in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century. In cities, a \"mellah\" was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway. Usually, the Jewish quarter was situated near the royal palace or the residence of the governor in order to protect its inhabitants from recurring riots. In contrast, rural \"mellahs\" were separate villages inhabited solely by the Jews.\n\nAccording to Jewish writer Robert Gessner, who travelled to Palestine in the 1930s, Tel Aviv had a ghetto for poorer Jews.\n\nThe Shanghai Ghetto was an area of approximately one square mile in the Hongkou District of Japanese-occupied Shanghai to which about 20,000 Jewish refugees were relocated by the Japanese-issued \"Proclamation Concerning Restriction of Residence and Business of Stateless Refugees\" after having fled from German-occupied Europe before and during World War II.\n\nMany people refer to the Gaza Strip as a ghetto, which is debated. The film \"Gaza Ghetto\" was made in 1984 documenting a family in the region.\n\nThe development of ghettos in the United States is closely associated with different waves of immigration and internal urban migration. The Irish and German immigrants of the mid-19th century were the first ethnic groups to form ethnic enclaves in United States cities. This was followed by large numbers of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, including many Italians and Poles between 1880 and 1920. These later European immigrants were more segregated than blacks in the early twentieth century. Most of these remained in their established immigrant communities, but by the second or third generation, many families were able to relocate to better housing in the suburbs after World War II.\n\nThese ethnic ghetto areas included the Lower East Side in Manhattan, New York, which later became notable as predominantly Jewish, and East Harlem, which became home to a large Puerto Rican community in the 1950s. Little Italys across the country were predominantly Italian ghettos. Many Polish immigrants moved to sections like Pilsen of Chicago and Polish Hill of Pittsburgh. Brighton Beach in Brooklyn is the home of mostly Russian and Ukrainian immigrants.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, many people would congregate in large open parking lots. They built shelters out of whatever materials they could find at the time. These congregations of shelters were also called \"ghettos\".\n\nA commonly used definition of a ghetto is a community distinguished by a homogeneous race or ethnicity. Additionally, a key feature that developed throughout the postindustrial era and continues to symbolize the demographics of American ghettos is the prevalence of poverty. Poverty constitutes the separation of ghettos from other, suburbanized or private neighborhoods. The high percentage of poverty partly justifies the difficulty of out-migration, which tends to reproduce constraining social opportunities and inequalities in society.\nUrban areas in the U.S. can often be classified as \"black\" or \"white\", with the inhabitants primarily belonging to a homogenous racial grouping. Forty years after the Civil Rights Movement, most of the United States remains a residentially segregated society in which blacks and whites inhabit different neighborhoods of significantly different quality.\n\nMany of these neighborhoods are located in Northern cities where African-Americans moved during the Great Migration (1914–1950), a period when over a million African-Americans moved out of the rural Southern United States to escape the widespread racism of the South, to seek out employment opportunities in urban environments, and to pursue what was widely perceived to be a better quality of life in the North.\n\nTwo main factors ensured further separation between races and classes, and ultimately the development of contemporary ghettos: the relocation of industrial enterprises, and the movement of middle to upper class residents into suburban neighborhoods. Between 1967 and 1987, economic restructuring resulted in a dramatic decline of manufacturing jobs. The once thriving northern industrial cities directed a shift to service occupations and in combination with the movement of middle-class families and other businesses to the suburbs, left much economic devastation in the inner cities. Consequently, African-Americans were disproportionately affected and became either unemployed or underemployed with little wage and reduced benefits. Accordingly, a concentration of African-Americans was established in the inner city neighbourhoods of places such as New York, Chicago and Detroit.\n\nIt is also significant to compare the demographic patterns between blacks and European immigrants, according to the labor market. European immigrants and African-Americans were both subject to an ethnic division of labor, and consequently African-Americans have predominated in the least secure division of the labor market. David Ward refers to this stagnant position in African-American or Black ghettos as the 'elevator' model, which implies that each group of immigrants or migrants takes turns in the processes of social mobility and suburbanization; and several groups did not start on the ground floor. The inability of blacks to move from the ground floor, as Ward suggests, is dependent upon prejudice and segregationist patterns experienced in the South prior to World War I. After the exodus of African-Americans to the North, the range of occupations in the North was further altered by the settlement of European immigrants; thus, African-Americans were diminished to unskilled jobs. The slow rate of advancement in black communities outlines the rigidity of the labor market, competition and conflict, adding another dimension to the prevalence of poverty and social instability in African-American or Black ghettos.\n\nIn the years following World War II, many white Americans began to move away from inner cities to newer suburban communities, a process known as white flight. White flight occurred, in part, as a response to black people moving into white urban neighborhoods. Discriminatory practices, especially those intended to \"preserve\" emerging white suburbs, restricted the ability of blacks to move from inner cities to the suburbs, even when they were economically able to afford it. In contrast to this, the same period in history marked a massive suburban expansion available primarily to whites of both wealthy and working-class backgrounds, facilitated through highway construction and the availability of federally subsidized home mortgages (VA, FHA, HOLC). These made it easier for families to buy new homes in the suburbs, but not to rent apartments in cities.\n\nThe United States began restructuring its economy after World War II, fueled by new globalizing processes, and demonstrated through technological advances and improvements in efficiency. The structural shift of 1973, during the postfordist era, became a large component to the racial ghetto and its relationship with the labor market. Sharon Zukin declares the designated stratum of African-Americans in the labor force was placed even below the working class; low-skill urban jobs were now given to incoming immigrants from Mexico or the Caribbean. Additionally, Zukin notes, \"Not only have social services been drastically reduced, punitive and other social controls over the poor have been increased,\" such as law enforcement and imprisonment. Described as the \"urban crisis\" during the 1970s and 1980s, the transition stressed regional divisions according to differences in income and racial lines – white \"donuts\" around black holes. Hardly coincidental, the steady separation occurred during the period of civil rights laws, urban riots and Black Power. In addition, the \"International Encyclopedia of Social Sciences\" stresses the various challenges developed by this \"urban crisis\", including:\n\nIn response to the influx of black people from the South, banks, insurance companies, and businesses began denying or increasing the cost of services, such as banking, insurance, access to jobs, access to health care, or even supermarkets to residents in certain, often racially determined, areas. The most devastating form of redlining, and the most common use of the term, refers to mortgage discrimination. Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid-twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by non-blacks to exclude blacks from outside neighborhoods.\n\nThe \"Racial\" Provisions of the FHA Underwriting Manual of 1936 included the following guidelines which exacerbated the segregation issue:\nThis meant that ethnic minorities could secure mortgage loans only in certain areas, and it resulted in a large increase in the residential racial segregation and urban decay in the United States. The creation of new highways in some cases divided and isolated black neighborhoods from goods and services, many times within industrial corridors. For example, Birmingham, Alabama's interstate highway system attempted to maintain the racial boundaries that had been established by the city's 1926 racial zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods and is associated with an increase in neighborhood racial segregation. Residential segregation was further perpetuated because whites were willing to pay more than blacks to live in predominantly white areas. Some social scientists suggest that the historical processes of suburbanization and decentralization are instances of white privilege that have contributed to contemporary patterns of environmental racism.\n\nFollowing the emergence of anti-discrimination policies in housing and labor sparked by the civil rights movement, members of the black middle class moved out of the ghetto. The Fair Housing Act was passed in 1968. This was the first federal law that outlawed discrimination in the sale and rental of housing on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion and later sex, familial status, and disability. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity was charged with administering and enforcing the law. Since housing discrimination became illegal, new housing opportunities were made available to the black community and many left the ghetto. Urban sociologists frequently title this historical event as \"black middle class exodus\" (also see black flight). Elijah Anderson describes a process by which members of the black middle class begin to distance themselves socially and culturally from ghetto residents during the later half of the twentieth century, \"eventually expressing this distance by literally moving away.\" This is followed by the exodus of black working-class families. As a result, the ghetto becomes primarily occupied by what sociologists and journalists of the 1980s and 1990s frequently title the \"underclass.\" William Julius Wilson suggests this exodus worsens the isolation of the black underclass – not only are they socially and physically distanced from whites, they are also isolated from the black middle class.\n\nTwo dominant theories arise pertaining to the production and development of U.S. ghettos. First are the race-based theorists who argue the importance of race in ghettos. Their analysis consists of the dominant racial group in the U.S. (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants) and their use of certain racist tactics in order to maintain their hegemony over blacks and lengthen their spatial separation. Race-based theorists offset other arguments that focus on the influence of the economy on segregation. More contemporary research of race-based theorists is to frame a range of methods conducted by white Americans to \"preserve race-based residential inequities\" as a function of the dominantly white, state-run government. Involving uneven development, mortgage and business discrimination and disinvestment – U.S. ghettos then, as suggested by race-based theorists, are conserved by distinctly racial reasoning. The more dominant view, on the other hand, is represented by class-based theorists. Such theories confirm class to be more important than race in the structuring of U.S. ghettos. Although racial concentration is a key signifier for ghettos, class-based theorists emphasize the role and impact of broader societal structures in the creation of African-American or Black ghettos. Dynamics of low-wage service and unemployment triggered from deindustrialization, and the intergenerational diffusion of status within families and neighborhoods, for instance, prove the rise in socioeconomic polarization between classes to be the creator of American ghetto; not racism. Furthermore, the culture of poverty theory, first developed by Oscar Lewis, states that a prolonged history of poverty can itself become a cultural obstacle to socioeconomic success, and in turn can continue a pattern of socioeconomic polarization. Ghettos, in short, instill a cultural adaptation to social and class-based inequalities, reducing the ability of future generations to mobilize or migrate.\n\nAn alternative theory put forward by Thomas Sowell in \"Black Rednecks and White Liberals\" asserts that modern urban black ghetto culture is rooted in the white Cracker culture of the North Britons and Scots-Irish who migrated from the generally lawless border regions of Britain to the American South, where they formed a redneck culture common to both blacks and whites in the antebellum South. Characteristics of this culture included lively music and dance, violence, unbridled emotions, flamboyant imagery, illegitimacy, religious oratory marked by strident rhetoric, and a lack of emphasis on education and intellectual interests. Because redneck culture proved counterproductive, \"that culture long ago died out...among both white and black Southerners, while still surviving today in the poorest and worst of the urban black ghettos\", which Sowell described as being characterized by \"brawling, braggadocio, self-indulgence, [and] disregard of the future\", and where \"belligerence is considered being manly and crudity is considered cool, while being civilized is regarded as 'acting white'.\" Sowell blames liberal Americans who since the 1960s have embraced black ghetto culture as the only \"'authentic' black culture and even glamorize it\" while they \"denounce any criticism of the ghetto lifestyle or any attempt to change it\". Sowell asserts that white liberal Americans have perpetuated this \"counterproductive and self-destructive lifestyle\" among black Americans living in urban ghettos through \"the welfare state, and look-the-other-way policing, and smiling at 'gangsta rap'.\"\n\nContemporary African-American or Black ghettos are characterized by an overrepresentation of a particular ethnicity or race, vulnerability to crime, social problems, governmental reliance and political disempowerment. Sharon Zukin explains that through these reasons, society rationalizes the term \"bad neighborhoods\". Zukin stresses that these circumstances are largely related to \"racial concentration, residential abandonment, and deconstitution and reconstitution of communal institutions.\" Many scholars diagnose this poorly facilitated and fragmented view of the United States as the \"age of extremes\". This term argues that inequalities of wealth and power reinforce spatial separation; for example, the growth of gated communities can be interconnected with the continued \"ghettoization\" of the poor.\n\nAnother characteristic to African-American or Black ghettos and spatial separation is the dependence on the state, and lack of communal autonomy; Sharon Zukin refers to Brownsville, Brooklyn, as an example. This relationship between racial ghettos and the state is demonstrated through various push and pull features, implemented through government subsidized investments, which certainly assisted the movement of white Americans into the suburbs after World War II. Since the 1960s, after the deconstitution of the inner cities, African-American or Black ghettos have attempted to reorganize or reconstitute; in effect, they are increasingly regarded as public- and state-dependent communities. Brownsville, for instance, initiated the constitution of community-established public housing, anti-poverty organizations, and social service facilities – all, in their own way, depend on state resources. However, certain dependence contradicts society's desires to be autonomous actors in the market. Moreover, Zukin implies, \"the less 'autonomous' the community – in its dependence on public schools, public housing and various subsidy programs – the greater the inequity between their organizations and the state, and the less willing residents are to organize.\" This should not, on the other hand, undermine local development corporations or social service agencies helping these neighborhoods. The lack of autonomy and growing dependence on the state, especially in a neoliberal economy, remains a key indicator to the production as well as the prevalence of African-American or Black ghettos, particularly due to the lack of opportunities to compete in the global market.\n\nDespite mainstream America's use of the term \"ghetto\" to signify a poor, culturally or racially homogenous urban area, those living in the area often used it to signify something positive. The black ghettos did not always contain dilapidated houses and deteriorating projects, nor were all of its residents poverty-stricken. For many African-Americans, the ghetto was \"home\": a place representing authentic blackness and a feeling, passion, or emotion derived from rising above the struggle and suffering of being black in America. Langston Hughes relays in the \"Negro Ghetto\" (1931) and \"The Heart of Harlem\" (1945): \"The buildings in Harlem are brick and stone/And the streets are long and wide,/But Harlem's much more than these alone,/Harlem is what's inside.\" Playwright August Wilson used the term \"ghetto\" in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\" (1984) and \"Fences\" (1987), both of which draw upon the author's experience growing up in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, a black ghetto.\n\nThe concept of 'the ghetto' and 'underclass' has faced criticism both theoretically and empirically. Research has shown significant differences in resources for neighborhoods with similar populations both across cities and over time. This includes differences in the resources of neighborhoods with predominantly low income or racial minority populations. The cause of these differences in resources across similar neighborhoods has more to do with dynamics outside of the neighborhood. To a large extent the problem with the 'ghetto' and 'underclass' concepts stem from the reliance on case studies (in particular case studies from Chicago), which limit social scientist understandings of socially disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\nRecently the word \"ghetto\" has been used in slang as an adjective rather than a noun. It is used to indicate an object's relation to the inner city or black culture, and also more broadly to denote something that is shabby or of low quality. While \"ghetto\" as an adjective can be used derogatorily, the African-American or Black community, particularly the hip hop scene, has taken the word for themselves and begun using it in a more positive sense that transcends its derogatory origins.\n\nIn 1973, \"Geographical Review\" claimed \"The degree of residential segregation of the black community is greater than for any other group in urban America, yet the blacks have not had the political power necessary to exercise any significant degree of control over the improvement of the basic services necessary for their health, education, and welfare.\" Scholars have been interested in the study of African-American or Black ghettos precisely for the concentration of disadvantaged residents and their vulnerability to social problems. American ghettos also bring attention to geographical and political barriers, and as Doreen Massey highlights, that racial segregation in African-American or Black ghettos challenge America's democratic foundations. However, it is still advocated that \"One solution to these problems depends on our ability to use the political process in eliminating the inequities... geographical knowledge and theory to public-policy decisions about poor people and poor regions is a professional obligation.\"\n\nA gay village (also known as a gay neighbourhood or 'gayborhood', gay enclave, gay village, gaytto, \"Boystown\") is a geographical area with generally recognized boundaries, inhabited or frequented by a large number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Unlike other ghettos, gay villages can be created by the LGBT community as an act of self-protection or even gentrification. Gay villages often contain a number of gay-oriented establishments, such as gay bars and pubs, nightclubs, bathhouses, restaurants, boutiques and bookstores.\n"}

It is organised by EWEA (European Wind Energy Association) and GWEC (Global Wind Energy Council).\nIn association with EWEA and GWEC, national wind energy associations and companies involved in wind energy production organise events in many countries around the world. In 2011, there were events organised in 30 countries, on 4 continents. Events included visits to onshore and offshore wind farms, information campaigns, demonstration turbines being set up in cities, wind workshops and a wind parade. Many events happened on Global Wind Day (15 June) itself, but there were also events on the days and weeks before and afterwards. In 2012 there were 250 events around the globe and a very popular photo competition. \n\nThe inaugural year of Wind Day (it did not become Global Wind Day until 2009) was organised by EWEA. The main idea was to coordinate events organised by national wind energy associations and companies active in the wind energy field. Wind Day in 2007 reached 18 countries in Europe, with a participation of around 35,000 people.\n\nWind Day 2008 reached 20 European countries and attracted 100,000 people.\n\nThis was the first year that EWEA joined forces with GWEC and extended the reach from European wind energy associations and companies to coordinate Wind Day events across the globe (and changing the name to Global Wind Day). In 2009 there were 300 events in 35 countries, reaching 1 million people.\n\nIn 2009 in Portugal the Wind Day was celebrated with an event called Wind Parade. It was organised in the city of Cascais just in front of the ocean. This project aimed to promote renewable energy good practices and in particular Wind Energy. It was supported by the City Council and conceived by Energia Lateral and implied the installation of 7 skstream micro wind turbines in a very visible place by the sea in June–July 9. One of the purposes was to involve children in the event and they were invited for a contest to decorate/paint small dummy wind turbines. Over 50 applications were submitted by 30 schools. The winner decorated a dummy wind turbine with Don Quixote elements comparing his fight against the windmills but in this case the wind mills being allies of Don Quixote in an epic effort to improve the environment.\n\nIn this year, 220 events took place in 30 countries, including the display of a 29.5 metre (96.7 ft) wind turbine blade in Brussels, Belgium, next to the main building of the European Commission and European Council. More than 1 million people were reached by Global Wind Day communications around the world.\n\nIn Brussels, Belgium, the home of EWEA and GWEC, a wind parade in Place de Luxembourg educated people working in the EU area on the benefits and importance of wind energy.\n\nGlobal Wind Day events happened in 30 countries around the world in 2011. Some examples include:\nIn France there were 15 events, ranging from wind farm inauguration to a jobs-in-the-wind-industry question and answer session. \nIn Austria, journalists leapt from the top of a turbine and abseiled to the ground. \nIn Japan there were 10 events, involving field trips to wind farms, experimental wind energy facilities and making wind turbines from a kit. \nIn Australia, an open day at a wind farm was available, with a community evening to finish off the day. \nIn Mexico, a public street fair featured a drawing competition for kids and a display of wind energy history.\n\nGlobal Wind Day partners organised 250 events around the globe in 2012, from wind farm open days to workshops, from\nphoto exhibition to regattas, from kite-flying to charity runs. For the first time, this included events in\nMexico, Chile, Israel, South Korea and South Africa.\nGlobal Wind Day 2012 gained the support of 18 GWD Ambassadors,who were joined by the Danish Presidency of the EU and the United Nations. Kandeh K. Yumkella, the Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the leader of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s Sustainable Energy for All initiative said, ‘We need to double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. This can be achieved with significant contribution from wind energy, both grid connected andfor small-scale decentralised systems. The ‘Global Wind Day’ on 15 June, does play a central role in contributing to the UNSG’s Sustainable Energy For All initiative through galvanising the much needed support for the wind energy industry from political leaders around the globe’.\nThe ‘Wind in Mind’ photo competition saw 2,300 photos from over 40 countries submitted.\n\nFor 2018, WindEurope and GWEC launched a global photo competition to capture the power of wind in the run up to Global Wind Day.\n\n"}

{"id": "1954993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954993", "title": "Groom of the Stool", "text": "Groom of the Stool\n\nThe Groom of the Stool (formally styled: \"Groom of the King's Close Stool\") was the most intimate of an English monarch's courtiers, responsible for assisting the king in excretion and ablution.\n\nThe physical intimacy of the role naturally led to him becoming a man in whom much confidence was placed by his royal master and with whom many royal secrets were shared as a matter of course. This secret information—while it would never have been revealed, to the discredit of his honour—in turn led to him becoming feared and respected and therefore powerful within the royal court in his own right. The office developed gradually over decades and centuries into one of administration of the royal finances, and under Henry VII, the Groom of the Stool became a powerful official involved in setting national fiscal policy, under the \"chamber system\".\n\nThe Groom of the Stool was, in the earliest times, a male servant in the household of an English monarch who was responsible for assisting the king in excretion and ablution, whilst maintaining an aura of royal decorum over the proceedings. The appellation \"Groom of the Close Stool\" derived from the item of furniture used as a toilet. It also appears as \"Grom of the Stole\" as the word \"Groom\" comes from the Old Low Franconian word \"Grom\".\n\nBy the Tudor age, the Groom of the Stool was a substantial figure like Hugh Denys (d.1511) who was a member of the Gloucestershire gentry, married to an aristocratic wife, and who died possessing at least four manors. The function was transformed into that of a virtual minister of the royal treasury, being then an essential figure in the king's management of fiscal policy.\n\nIn the early years of Henry VIII's reign, the title was awarded to court companions of the king who spent time with him in the privy chamber. These were generally the sons of noblemen or important members of the gentry. In time they came to act as virtual personal secretaries to the king, carrying out a variety of administrative tasks within his private rooms. The position was an especially prized one, as it allowed unobstructed access to the king. David Starkey writes: \"The Groom of the Stool had (to our eyes) the most menial tasks; his standing, though, was the highest ... Clearly then, the royal body service must have been seen as entirely honourable, without a trace of the demeaning or the humiliating.\" Further, \"the mere word of the Gentleman of the Privy Chamber was sufficient evidence in itself of the king's will\", and the Groom of the Stool bore \"the indefinable charisma of the monarchy\".\n\nThe office was exclusively one serving male monarchs, so on the accession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558, it was replaced by the First Lady of the Bedchamber, first held by Kat Ashley. The office effectively came to an end when it was \"neutralised\" in 1559. On the accession of James I, the male office was revived as the senior Lord of the Bedchamber, who always was a great nobleman who had considerable power because of its intimate access to the king. During the reign of Charles I, the term \"stool\" appears to have lost its original signification of \"chair\". \n\nThe office fell into disuse with the accession of Queen Victoria, though her husband, Prince Albert, and their son, Edward, Prince of Wales employed similar courtiers, now renamed \"Groom of the Stole\", from the Latin \"stola\", a long outer garment or robe worn by Roman ladies. The Tudor historian David Starkey classes this change as classic Victorianism: \"When the Victorians came to look at this office, they spelt it s-t-o-l-e, and imagined all kinds of fictions about elaborate robes draped around the neck of the monarch at the coronation.\" When Edward acceded to the throne as Edward VII in 1901, he discontinued the office.\n\nOften when the visit of a modern monarch is planned, for example during the construction of a new building, a special royal lavatory pavilion is built for the occasion.\n\nHugh Denys controlled the private and secret finances of King Henry VII.\n\nHeneage and Denny, as servants \"whom he used secretly about him\", were privy to Henry VIII's most intimate confidences about Anne of Cleves. He told them he doubted her virginity, on account of \"her brests so slacke\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29873034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29873034", "title": "Human trafficking in Belarus", "text": "Human trafficking in Belarus\n\nBelarus is a source, destination, and transit country for women, men, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor. The majority of identified Belarusian victims were females forced into prostitution abroad, including in: Russia, Germany, Poland, other European countries, Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and the UAE. There were reports that women from low-income families in Belarus’ regions were subjected to forced prostitution in Minsk. Belarusian men, women, and children continued to be subjected to forced begging, as well as forced labor in the construction industry and other sectors in Russia. According to the Ministry of Interior, Belarusian single, unemployed females between the ages of 16 and 30 were most at risk of being trafficked. Human traffickers often used informal social networks to approach potential victims.\n\nThe Government of Belarus does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government’s response to trafficking is difficult to gauge due to the closed nature of the government, sparse independent reporting, and general fear of government retaliation for criticism of the ruling regime. However, based on available information, the government appeared to have sustained its efforts to prosecute and punish trafficking offenders in 2009. While the government appeared to continue positive steps toward improved treatment of victims and support of the anti-trafficking NGO community, the overall political climate of intimidation was a natural obstacle to authentic government partnerships with victims and anti-trafficking organizations. Funding for victim assistance programs codified into law in 2005 remained unrealized.\n\nThe U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed Belarus in \"Tier 3\" in 2017.\n\nThe government sustained law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. Belarusian law prohibits trafficking in persons for both sexual exploitation and labor exploitation under Article 181 of its criminal code, which prescribes penalties ranging from two to 15 years’ imprisonment in addition to asset forfeiture. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and are commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes. The government reported 219 human trafficking investigations in 2009, including at least 10 labor trafficking investigations. Authorities reportedly prosecuted 61 cases under Article 181, and convicted 15 trafficking offenders under the same statute in 2009, down from 17 convictions in 2008. The government did not report how many of the convictions were for forced labor versus forced prostitution. Officials reported that the majority of convicted trafficking offenders were given imposed sentences of over eight years’ imprisonment, in addition to the forfeiture of assets.\n\nWhile reports indicated that officials engaged in corrupt practices, there were no reports of government complicity in human trafficking during the reporting period – such information may have been limited because of lack of press freedom and imprisonment of citizens for criticizing government officials in Belarus. In general, the judiciary lacked independence, trial outcomes usually were predetermined, and many trials were conducted behind closed doors. The Ministry of Interior continued to provide at least partial funding for its anti-trafficking training center, which has trained 47 Belarusian law enforcement officers and officials from other governments as trafficking specialists since 2007. Courses at the center reportedly focused on anti-trafficking law enforcement techniques and victim assistance, and were developed in partnership with IOM, other international organizations, and NGOs. The government reported partnerships with the following governments on trafficking cases: Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Israel, and Turkey.\n\nThe government demonstrated minimal progress in protecting victims of trafficking during the reporting period, including a significant decrease in the number of victims identified. In 2009, authorities identified 369 victims of sex trafficking, including 35 children, and 29 labor trafficking victims in 2009, a significant decrease from a total of 591 victims identified in 2008. The government reported referring only 131 victims to service providers for assistance, raising concerns that the formal, national trafficking victim referral mechanism was not successfully implemented. Law enforcement officials generally referred trafficking victims to IOM or NGO shelters – which relied on donor funding – to provide short and longer term protection and rehabilitation; the government referred child trafficking victims to NGOs for assistance.\n\nThe government again failed to provide funding for specialized victim assistance programs pledged in a 2005 presidential decree, but provided some in-kind donations to NGOs. Victims could seek state medical assistance and some other services, such as vocational training, free of charge, but most victims declined assistance from government facilities. Government sources acknowledged that victims were more likely to trust NGOs than government sources of assistance. Anti-trafficking NGOs reported little government interference in their operations; they also reported improved communication with government officials during past year. In some instances during the reporting period, the government permitted NGO specialists to attend police interviews and closed court hearings upon victims’ requests.\n\nThe government claimed to have encouraged victims to participate in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. The anti-trafficking training center reportedly emphasized the need to avoid coercing victims, which had been reported as a problem in the past. There were no reports of identified victims being penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Belarusian law allows for authorities to grant temporary residency status to foreign victims, though no victims chose this immigration relief during the reporting period.\n\nThe government demonstrated modest progress in trafficking prevention activities during the reporting period. Citizens, the media, and NGOs in Belarus are often subjected to government intimidation and strict control, which limited open discussion about the trafficking situation in the country. Officials continued to conduct press conferences and briefings on the anti-trafficking situation in Belarus, focusing primarily on forced prostitution, during the reporting period. The government aired IOM-sponsored anti-trafficking public service announcements on state television and on television screens in subway stops, which resulted in an increased number of calls to IOM’s hotline. The Ministry of Interior continued to run a hotline offering information regarding the licensing status and legitimacy of marriage, modeling agencies, and agencies involved in work and study abroad. NGO's reported cooperation between the government hotline and their own hotlines, as well as partnerships with authorities in distributing NGO-funded public awareness materials. There were reports that some policies described by the Belarusian government as anti-trafficking measures were responsible for restricting Belarusian citizens’ ability to travel abroad for legitimate purposes. The government’s national action plan on trafficking, which expired in 2010, focused on illegal migration which may lead to confusion between trafficking and smuggling.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5048934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5048934", "title": "Interservice rivalry", "text": "Interservice rivalry\n\nInterservice rivalry is the rivalry between different branches of a country's armed forces, in other words the competition for limited resources among a nation's land, naval, and air forces. The term also applies to the rivalries between a country’s intelligence services (e.g. CIA and FBI in the United States), or between the police and fire services of a city, such as the NYPD and FDNY.\n\nInterservice rivalries occur at all levels of the military, from the vying for key posts such as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States, Chief of the Defence Staff in the United Kingdom, or Jefe del Estado Mayor de la Defensa in Spain.\n\nInterservice rivalry can occur over such topics as the appropriation of the military budget, prestige or the possession of certain types of weapons. The latter case can arise, for example, when the navy operates an aircraft carrier, which may be viewed by the air force as an infringement of its traditional responsibilities. Another case was the dispute between the Indian Army and Indian Air Force, which erupted when these two branches fought over the ownership of AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopters in 2012.\n\nSuch rivalries are often seen as negative influences on the effectiveness of a country's armed forces. However, they also serve as a balancing factor, introducing some of the desirable effects of competition to an otherwise traditionally very closed and centralized institution.\n\nMany military analysts consider the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany's armed forces, pioneers of \"jointness\" (\"integrierter Kriegführung\", in German). They point out that Blitzkrieg, the war-fighting style that brought the Wehrmacht stunning victories between 1939 and 1941, depended upon the close integration of ground and air (and sometimes naval) forces and that even after the Blitzkrieg campaigns gave way to a drawn-out war of attrition, the Wehrmacht routinely conducted operations in a way that would today be called \"joint\". That is, elements of two or more services participated in close cooperation with mutually agreed goals, relatively little inter-service rivalry, and a command structure that, at least at the \"sharp end\" of operations, promoted, rather than inhibited, a spirit of jointness. Consequently, the analysts assert, the Wehrmacht enhanced its capabilities and improved its combat effectiveness.\nHitler certainly understood the value of integrating his land, sea and air forces and placing them under a unified command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (first under Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg's command; later his own). He also saw the benefit of placing them under operational commanders who possessed at least a rudimentary understanding of the tactics, techniques, needs, capabilities and limitations of each of the services functioning in their combat zone. Hitler was thus innovative and several years ahead of his peers in the democracies, Italy and the Soviet Union. Yet, largely because of Hitler's unusual and autocratic command style and difficulties with delegation, the Wehrmacht lacked elements that today's theorists consider essential to the attainment of truly productive jointness (a single joint commander or Joint Chief of Staff, a proper joint staff, a joint planning process, and an absence of inter-service rivalry) and that, as a result, it often suffered needless difficulties in combat.\n\nThe rivalries shaped between security organizations in Iran are as follows: \n\nInfighting between the Indian Army and Indian Air Force (IAF) over armed helicopters has existed for a decade; this came to light during the Kargil War in 1999.\n\nIn response to the request for Army-owned attack helicopters from General Bikram Singh, Chief of Army Staff, the Indian government made an agreement about the transfer of IAF AH-64D Apache Longbows to the Army in 2012. The IAF, however, offered stiff resistance against the decision, and insisted that all attack and medium-lift helicopters be under its control.\n\nIn 2013, Air Chief Marshal NAK Browne, who faced against the Army for the helicopter issue, said that the AH-64Ds would be kept in the Air Force.\n\nThe long-term discord between the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy was one of the most notorious examples of inter-service rivalry. The situation, with its origin traced back to the Meiji period, came with both geo-political and military consequences leading to Japan's involvement in World War II. The IJA/IJN rivalry expressed itself in the early 1930s as the “strike north” (\"Hokushin-ron\") and “strike south” (\"Nanshin-ron\") factions. The goal of both factions was to seize territories which possessed the raw materials, especially petroleum, which Japan needed to sustain its growth and economy, but which it did not possess itself. The strike north faction advocated the taking of the natural resources of Siberia, by way of Manchuria, a scenario in which the prime role would be taken by the Army, the strike south faction advocated the taking of the oil-rich Dutch East Indies, a scenario in which the Navy would predominate.\n\nIn order to further their own faction, relatively junior officers resorted to the assassinations of members of the rival faction and their supporters in government. With both factions being opposed to the peace faction, this period has become known as the era of government by assassination. Insubordination by the Kwantung Army led first to the occupation of Manchuria, and later the Second Sino-Japanese War following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. However, at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol, any farther expansion northwards into Siberia was shown to be impossible given the Soviet superiority in numbers and armour.\n\nWith the loss of Army prestige, that followed the failure of the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, the Navy faction gained the ascendency, supported by a number of the powerful industrial zaibatsus, that were convinced that their interests would be best served fulfilling the needs of the Navy, and this paved the way to the Pacific War.\n\nThe IJA and IJN rivalry also saw both services developing air arms, the Army creating its own amphibious infantry units and running ships and submarines, including submarine chasers and aircraft carriers, the Navy meanwhile would create its own infantry and marine paratroopers.\n\nOther examples of this rivalry include the Japanese Navy taking several weeks to inform the Army of the disastrous results of the Battle of Midway.\n\nThe Pakistani Armed Forces used to fight over a number of issues. One in particular was predominantly between the Navy and the Army over budget distribution. A key point of friction was the induction of the cruiser PNS \"Babur\". This was resolved, however, when Pakistani think tanks realized the need for interservice harmony and established the Joint Services Headquarters. This unified headquarters has almost eliminated the friction between the services.\n\nA case in point is the rivalry between the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Marines, which are part of the Army and the Royal Navy, respectively, in the UK. Since some of their capabilities overlap, pressure can be put on the political or civilian decision makers to choose one or the other.\n\nAnother form of rivalry within the United Kingdom is between certain forces of the Cadets: the Sea Cadet Corps, the Army Cadet Force, and the Air Training Corps; and between the Coldstream Guards and the Grenadier Guards, over the issue of seniority.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense was originally created to provide overall coordination for the various branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, whose infighting, particularly between the Army and Navy, was seen as detrimental to military effectiveness during World War II.\n\nThe rivalries are also based on services' individual philosophies for rules and behavior. An author wrote in 2012 about the differing cultures of the United States Navy and United States Air Force's pilots:\n\nVarious mechanisms are used to manage or curb interservice rivalries. In the United States Armed Forces, for example, an officer must complete at least one joint tour in another service to reach the level of Flag or General Officer. Such officers may be described as \"wearing purple,\" a reference to the Army's green, the Marines' navy blue, the Air Force's blue, the Navy's white, and the Coast Guard's blue uniforms.\n\nOne well-known encounter, the Revolt of the Admirals, took place after the end of World War II. The newly created United States Air Force, sought to create a doctrine which relied heavily on strategic long-range bombing and the Army a large number of reservist troops. Both the Air Force and the Army claimed that the future of warfare depended on the issue of nuclear deterrent, and as such the use of naval gunfire support, as well as the amphibious assault doctrine of the U.S. Marine Corps, was outdated and would never be used again. The Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson succeeded to strip the Navy of funds on its first supercarrier, the \"United States\". This cancellation caused multiple high ranking Navy personnel to resign. The aftermath backfired against the Navy, and caused Congress to review, and after investigation enabled the implementation of the creation of a Strategic Air Force supporting a nuclear mission.\n\nInterservice rivalries are often played out at divisional or regimental level or between special forces that are part of different services. The rivalry between special-forces units led to the creation of United Kingdom Special Forces in the United Kingdom, and SOCOM in the United States to put them all under a unified command, putting an end to the \"rice-bowl\" doctrine which created absurd situations in Iran, Grenada and Panama in the 1980s. In the United Kingdom it has put an end to members of the Special Boat Service being recruited solely from the Royal Marines and it is now a tri-service branch.\n\n"}
{"id": "17550417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17550417", "title": "Joanes Leizarraga", "text": "Joanes Leizarraga\n\nJoanes Leizarraga (1506–1601) was a 16th-century Basque priest. He is most famous for being the first to attempt the standardisation of the Basque language and for the translation of religious works into Basque, in particular the first Basque translation of the New Testament.\n\nFrench spellings of his name are often encountered in older works, for example \"Ioannes Leiçarraga\" and \"Jean de Liçarrague\" and various other spellings of his surname such as \"Leissarrague\" or \"Leiçarraga\". or in Spanish Juan de Lizárraga.\n\nLeizarraga was born in the Northern Basque Country in the province of Labourd in a village called Briscous in 1506. Although the village was in Labourd, it fell within the area of the Lower Navarrese dialect of Basque. His family's farmhouse bore the family's name, Leizarraga, and stood in Briscous until it was destroyed in 1944. Very little is known about Leizarraga's early years beyond these few facts.\n\nLeizarraga was baptised a Catholic. Although it is not known where he trained, he was trained as a priest and converted to Protestantism in 1560. By 1563, his name is mentioned in the records of the Protestant Synod of Béarn.\n\nIn his dedication of the New Testament to Jeanne d'Albret he mentions having spent time in prison but again, it is not known which prison he was in, what the charge was or how long he was imprisoned for.\n\nHe was instituted as rector of the church in Bastide in Lower Navarre in 1567 by Jeanne d'Albret. By the time Leizarraga came to Bastide, the majority of inhabitants were not speaking Basque but Gascon, since it had come to be populated by a Gascon colony. Nonetheless, Leizarraga was even in his time renowned as a great scholar of the Basque language, the very reason he would later be entrusted with the translation of the New Testament. It is also known that various Basque shepherds in the area sent their children to him so that he would teach them Basque.\n\nHe was married but it is not known when or to whom.\n\nIn March 1563 Leizarraga was instructed by Jeanne d'Albret, the Queen of Navarre at the Synod of Béarn to produce a Basque translation of the New Testament. Having negotiated the tricky issue of translating into a language which by then had no great written tradition, common standard or spelling system, he persevered with some help from four old Catholic colleagues: Piarres Landetxeberri from Espès-Undurein, Sanz de Tartas from Charritte-de-Bas (both in Soule), Joanes Etxeberri from Saint-Jean-de-Luz and a Mr Tardets who was a minister in Ostabat. Finally, in 1571, the printer Pierre Hautin based in La Rochelle printed three works by Leizarraga, amongst them is translation of the New Testament.\n\nIt is indicative of the respect he commanded that in 1582 he was visited by Jacques Auguste de Thou, the man who would later negotiate the Edict of Nantes on religious tolerance. In his writings, Thou mentions Leizarraga and the copy of the Basque translation of the New Testament he had been given as a gift during his visit. This copy today is in the National Library of France.\n\nIt is also Thou who mentions the exceptionally harmonious relationship between Protestants and Catholics in Bastide where according to him both faiths were worshipped in the church, something that was rare in 16th century France which is known for its religious wars.\n\nBy 1594 Leizarraga was no longer attending the Synod of Béarn, the record stating \"Monsieur de Lissarrague, ministre de Labastide de Clarence, excusé pour sa vieillesse et pour son indisposition\" \"Mr Liazarraga, minister of Bastida, makes his excuse due to old age and being indisposed\".\nHe died in Bastide in 1601 at the age of 95.\n\nLeizarraga published three books, all in 1571: \nThe most famous of these undoubtedly is the \"Testamentu Berria\" which even today is known as \"Leizarraga's New Testament\". Apart from the New Testament's main text, his translation also includes the following addenda:\n\nThe \"Kalendrera\" is short, 15 page calendar with monthly listings of religious events and holidays, the \"ABC\" a short collection of common prayers and instructions on how to conduct daily worship.\n\nThe main criticism that has been made of his work is that he often used Romance loanwords where native terms exist. For example, he translates \"fisher of men\" as \"giza pescadorea\" rather than \"giza arrantzalea\". At the same time, he uses grammatical forms which were most likely archaic even in his period.\n\nThe other main criticism was, that as an over-regional standard, he based his standard too much on his native Lapurdian dialect and the two other Northern dialects with very little regard to the Southern dialects. However, it must be remembered that he was the first to tackle standardisation and that there was no previous work he could build upon and that with his limited resources he had to carry out most of the work himself.\n\nOverall, the quality of his translations and the thoroughness of his effort at standardising Basque were and are recognised today, and have in no small way contributed to the formation of Standard Basque.\n\nLeizarraga's texts provide a wealth of data on the Basque of his time.\n\nAs an example, the following is a comparison between Leizarraga's version and the modern version of the Lord's prayer (in Leizarraga's orthography):\n\nLeizarraga's work represents the first documented effort to bring together the various Basque dialects in a single standard. His form of Basque was largely based on the Northern dialects Lapurdian, Zuberoan and Lower Navarrese which at the time were considered the prestigious varieties of Basque.\n\nHe discusses the issue of dialectal divergence in the foreword and says:\nIn the 20th century, Federico Krutwig proposed to the Basque Academy Leizarraga's language as the basis for Modern Standard Basque, but his ideas did not get enough support.\n\n\n"}

They are among the earliest settlers in the Malay peninsula. Kedahan Malays comprised at least 15% of the total Malaysian Malay population.\n\nAccording to history, Kedah was very popular among Arabian traders. Thus, this has led to interracial marriages between Arabs and Malays. Due to Arabic influences in the Kedahan Malay language, some Kedahan Malay are of Arab descent. However some of the Kedahan Malays that resided on the island-state of Penang might have Indian and/or Chinese blood and some who lived in Thailand might have Thai blood.\n\nKedah Valley is an area where the majority inhabitants are Kedahan Malays. The valley covered the Satun province of Thailand and the three northern states of Malaysia (Perlis, Kedah, Pulau Pinang) with at least an area of 25,908 km square.\n\nNowadays, most Kedahan Malays known themselves as \"Orang Utara\" or People Of The Northern Region instead of Kedahan Malay since that they resided the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia.

It is related to other varieties of Malay spoken in the peninsular but has its own unique pronunciation and also vocabulary. Kedahan Malay language can be divided into several sub-dialects, namely Kedah Persisiran (standard) or Kedah Hulu, Kedah Utara, Perlis-Langkawi, Penang and some others (sub-dialects spoken in Satun and Southern Myanmar). For instance instead of using \"kamu\" to denote as 'you', \"hang\" (English pronunciation: \"hung\") is used instead and \"cek\" for 'i/me' instead of \"aku\" in other Malay varieties in the peninsular. Besides proper Kedah Malay, another variety of Malay spoken is Baling Malay, which is distinct from Kedah Malay and more closely related to varieties of Malay spoken in Southern Thailand and East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Kedah Malay is considered distinct enough to have its own ISO code that is meo.\n\nKedahan Malay shares the same customs and traditions with other Malay in Peninsular Malaysia.

It is part of the Gallo-Italic and Western Romance dialect continuum. The Genoese (\"Zeneize\"), spoken in Genoa, the capital of Liguria, is the language's prestige dialect on which the standard is based.\n\nThere is a long literary tradition of Ligurian poets and writers that goes from the 13th century to the present, such as Luchetto (the Genoese Anonym), Martin Piaggio and Gian Giacomo Cavalli.\n\nLigurian does not enjoy an official status in Italy. Hence, it is not protected by law. Historically, Genoese (the dialect spoken in the city of Genoa) is the written \"koine\", owing to its semi-official role as language of the Republic of Genoa, its traditional importance in trade and commerce and its vast literature.\n\nLike other regional languages in Italy, the use of Ligurian and its dialects is in rapid decline. ISTAT (the Italian central service of statistics) claims that in 2012, only 9% of the population used other than standard Italian with friends and family, which decreases to 1.8% with strangers. Furthermore, according to ISTAT, regional languages are more commonly spoken by uneducated people and the elderly, mostly in rural areas. Liguria is no exception. One can reasonably suppose the age pyramid to be strongly biased toward the elderly who were born before World War II, with proficiency rapidly approaching zero for newer generations. On a more positive note, Ligurian has not experienced in recent years as strong a decline in number of native speakers as other regional languages. That could be a consequence of its status or the early, catastrophic decline it underwent in the past. The language itself is actively preserved by various groups.\n\nNotable native speakers of Ligurian include Niccolò Paganini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Christopher Columbus, Eugenio Montale, Giulio Natta, Italo Calvino, and Fabrizio De André. There is also a popular musical group, Buio Pesto, who compose songs entirely in the language.\n\nBecause of the importance of Genoese trade, Ligurian was once spoken well beyond the borders of the modern province. It has since given way to standard varieties, such as Standard Italian and French. In particular, the language is traditionally spoken in coastal, northern Tuscany, southern Piedmont (part of the province of Alessandria), western extremes of Emilia-Romagna (some areas in the province of Piacenza), in a small area of southern Sardinia (the so-called Tabarchino), where its use is ubiquitous and increasing. Until recently, it was also spoken in the department of the Alpes-Maritimes of France (mostly the Côte d'Azur from the Italian border to and including Monaco), in a township at the southern tip of the French island of Corsica (Bonifacio) and by a large community in Gibraltar (UK). It has been adopted formally in Monaco as the Monégasque dialect; or locally, \"Munegascu\", without the status of official language (that is French). Monaco is the only place where a variety of Ligurian is taught in school.\n\nThe Mentonasc dialect, spoken in the East of the County of Nice, is considered to be a transitional Occitan dialect to Ligurian; conversely, the Roiasc and Pignasc spoken further North in the Eastern margin of the County are Ligurian dialects with Occitan influences.\n\nAs a Gallo-Italic language, Ligurian is most closely related to Lombard, Piedmontese and Emilian-Romagnol language, all of which are spoken in neighboring provinces. Unlike the aforementioned languages, however, it exhibits distinct Italian features. No link between Romance Ligurian and the Ligurian language of the ancient Ligurian populations, in the form of a substrate or otherwise, can be demonstrated by linguistic evidence. Only the toponyms are known to have survived from ancient Ligurian, the name \"Liguria\" being the most obvious example.\n\nVariants of the Ligurian language are:\n\nThe Ligurian alphabet has:\n\nAccording to the spelling of the Genoese \"Académia Ligùstica do Brénno\"\n\n\n"}

It is a dead language, with its last native speaker having died in 2013. It is closely related to Estonian. The native land of the Livonian people is the Livonian Coast of the Gulf of Livonia, located in Latvia in the north of the Kurzeme peninsula.\n\nSome ethnic Livonians are learning or have learned Livonian in an attempt to revive it, but because ethnic Livonians are a small minority, opportunities to use Livonian are limited. The Estonian newspaper \"Eesti Päevaleht\" erroneously announced that Viktors Bertholds, who died on 28 February 2009, was the last native speaker who started the Latvian-language school as a monolingual. Some other Livonians had argued, however, that there were some native speakers left, including Viktors Bertholds' cousin, . Kristiņa died in 2013. An article published by the Foundation for Endangered Languages in 2007 stated that there were only 182 registered Livonians and a mere six native speakers. In a 2009 conference proceeding, it was mentioned that there could be \"at best 10 living native\" speakers of the language.\n\nThe promotion of the Livonian language as a living language has been advanced mostly by the Livonian Cultural Centre (\"\"), an organisation of mostly young Livonians. Livonian as a lesser used language in Latvia – along with Latgalian – is represented by the Latvian Bureau of Lesser Used Languages (LatBLUL), formerly a national branch of the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages (EBLUL).\n\nThe language is taught in universities in Latvia, Estonia and Finland, which constantly increases the pool of second-language speakers who do not constantly reside in Latvia.\n\nIn the 19th century, about 2,000 people still spoke Livonian; in 1852, the number of Livonians was 2,394. Various historical events have led to the near total language death of Livonian:\n\nIn the 13th century, the native Livonians inhabited the Estonian counties Alempois, Jogentagana Järva, Läänemaa, Mõhu, Nurmekund, Sakala, Ugandi, and Vaiga in the north, and by the Daugava in the south. The Livonian settlement of Curonia was also begun then. In the 12th-13th centuries the Livonian lands were conquered by the Teutonic Order. The conquest led to a strong decrease in the number of speakers of the Livonian language, empty Livonian lands inhabited by the Latvians, which contributed to the replacement of the Livonian language in favor of Latvian. It is estimated that at the time of the German colonization, there were 30,000 Livonians. In the 19th century the number of speakers of the Couronian dialect is estimated as follows: 2,074 people in 1835, 2,324 people in 1852, 2,390 people in 1858, 2,929 people in 1888. According to the Soviet Census of 1989, 226 people were Livonian, and almost half of them spoke Livonian. According to estimates of the Liv Culture Center in 2010, only 40 people spoke Livonian in everyday life. In 2013, there were none who spoke Livonian in everyday life.\n\nThe first Livonian words were recorded in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry. The first written sources about Livonian appeared in the 16th century. The collection of Livonian poems \"Mariners sacred songs and prayers\" () was translated to Latvian by Jānis Prints and his son Jānis Jr. was published in 1845. The first book in Livonian was the Gospel of Matthew, and was published in 1863 in London in both the eastern and western Courland dialects. It was translated to eastern Couronian by Nick Pollmann, and to western Couronian by Jānis Prints and Peteris. The plan with the book was to establish a standard orthography by F. Wiedemann, which consisted of 36 letters with many diacritics. The total circulation was 250 copies. The Livonians received only one copy of each dialect. The second book in Livonian was the same Gospel of Matthew, published in 1880 in St. Petersburg, with an orthography based on Latvian and German.\n\nIn the interwar period, there were several dozen books published in Livonian, mainly with the help of Finnish and Estonian organizations. In 1930, the first newspaper in Livonian, \"Līvli\", was published. In 1942, a translation of the New Testament was published in Helsinki. It was translated by Kōrli Stalte, with help from the Finnish linguist Lauri Kettunen. After the war, books in Livonian were no longer published, as Latvia was in the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter Latvia regained its independence, the newsletter \"Õvâ\" was published in Livonian in 1994, dedicated to the Livonian culture, art and figures of the national movement, and in 1998 with the support of the \"Open Society\", the first collection of poetry anthology in Livonian \"Ma akūb sīnda vizzõ, tūrska!\" was published and presented in Finland and Estonia, and it combines the works of famous Livonian poets. To date, the only Livonian media outlet is trilingual (English-Latvian-Livonian) livones.lv (livones.net) operated by the Liv Culture Center.\n\nViktors Bertholds (July 10, 1921 – February 28, 2009), one of the last Livonian speakers of the generation who learnt Livonian as first language in a Livonian-speaking family and community, died on February 28, 2009. Though it was reported that he was the last native speaker of the language, Livonians themselves claimed that there are more native speakers still alive, albeit very few.\n\nAs reported in the Estonian newspaper \"Eesti Päevaleht\", Viktors Bertholds was born in 1921 and probably belonged to the last generation of children who started their (Latvian-medium) primary school as Livonian monolinguals; only a few years later it was noted that Livonian parents had begun to speak Latvian with their children. During World War II, Bertholds, unlike most Livonian men, managed to avoid being mobilized in the armies of either occupation force by hiding in the woods. After the war, Bertholds worked in various professions and shared his knowledge of Livonian language with many field linguists; in the 1990s, he also taught Livonian in children’s summer camps.\n\nBertholds' Livonian-speaking brother and wife died in the 1990s. In the early 2000s, many other prominent \"last Livonians\" also died, such as Poulin Klavin (1918–2001), keeper of many Livonian traditions and the last Livonian to reside permanently on the Courland coast, and Edgar Vaalgamaa (1912–2003), clergyman in Finland, translator of the New Testament and author of a book on the history and culture of the Livonians.\n\nSupposedly the last native speaker of Livonian was Grizelda Kristiņa, née Bertholds (1910–2013), who lived in Canada beginning in 1947. According to Valts Ernštreits, she spoke Livonian as well \"as if she had stepped out of her home farm in a Livonian coastal village just yesterday\". She was also a member of the Bertholds family and qualified as the last living native speaker of the Livonian language of her generation. She died on June 2, 2013.\n\nThe survival of the Livonian language now depends on young Livonians who learned Livonian in their childhood from grandparents or great-grandparents of the pre-war generations. There are not very many of them, but all in all, there are a few hundred ethnic Livonians in Latvia now who are interested in their Livonian roots. Some young Livonians not only sing folk-songs in Livonian but even strive at actively using Livonian in everyday communication. One such younger generation Livonian speaker is Julgī Stalte, who performs with the Livonian-Estonian World Music group Tuļļi Lum.\n\nLivonian, like Estonian, has lost vowel harmony, but unlike Estonian, it has also lost consonant gradation.\n\nLivonian has 8 vowels (2 vowels, marked in parentheses, were present in earlier generations but merged with other vowels in later generations; These were present as late as 1997):\n\n\nAll vowels can be long or short. Short vowels are written as indicated in the table; long vowels are written with an additional macron (\"ˉ\") over the letter, so, for example, = . The Livonian vowel system is notable for having a \"stød\" similar to Danish. As in other languages with this feature, it is thought to be a vestige of an earlier pitch accent.\n\nLivonian has also a large number of diphthongs, as well as a number of triphthongs. These can also occur short or long.\n\nThe two opening diphthongs and vary in their stress placement depending on length: short \"ie\", \"uo\" are realized as rising , , while long \"īe\", \"ūo\" are realized as falling , . The same applies to the triphthongs \"uoi\" : \"ūoi\".\n\nLivonian has 23 consonants:\n\nThe Livonian alphabet is a hybrid which mixes Latvian and Estonian orthography.\nThe letters in parentheses were used for phonemes that were unrounded in later generations; these were used as late as 1997.\n\nLivonian has for centuries been thoroughly influenced by Latvian in terms of grammar, phonology and word derivation etc. The dative case in Livonian, for example, is very unusual in a Finnic language. There are about 2,000 Latvian and 200 German loanwords in Livonian and most of the German words were adopted through Latvian. Latvian, however, was influenced by Livonian as well. Its regular syllable stress based on Livonian is very unusual in a Baltic language. In both languages the letter \"h\" is silent, unlike other Finnic and Baltic languages. Especially as of the end of the nineteenth century there was a great deal of contact with Estonians, namely between (Kurzeme) Livonian fishers or mariners and the Estonians from Saaremaa or other islands. Many inhabitants of the islands of Western Estonia worked in the summer in Kurzeme Livonian villages. As a result, a knowledge of Estonian spread among those Livonians and words of Estonian origin also came into Livonian. There are about 800 Estonian loanwords in Livonian, most of which were borrowed from the Saaremaa dialect.\n\n\n1st Article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nEnglish: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

He is an ethnic Pashtun from the Durrani tribe. After graduating from Pakistan Military Academy in 1961 in the 24th PMA Long Course (same batch as General Jehangir Karamat who later became the Army chief) and winning the sword of honour, he served in various command, staff and instructional posts for about 16 years. From 1977 to 1982 he was Pakistani Armed Forces attaché in Washington, D.C. He then served as military secretary to the president of Pakistan until 1986.\n\nDurrani was the posted as the commander the 1st Armoured Division in Multan, and being the former MS to the president persuaded the then Army chief and president General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to witness the tank exercise in Bahawalpur desert on 17 August 1988. It was on its way back to Islamabad, that the C-130 carrying the presidential and higher military entourage crashed right after taking off from Bahawalpur airport killing everyone on board.\n\nHe was also suspected by, then United States Ambassador to India, John Gunther Dean for being \"extraordinarily insistent\" with President Zia to visit the demonstration. From many circles within Pakistan he is considered to be the prime suspect in the incident. Durrani could prevail on Gen Zia because he had been his most trusted military secretary. Indeed, after Gen Zia's death, Begum Zia continued to repose trust in Gen Durrani, as narrated in \"Khaki Shadows\" by General Khalid Mahmud Arif the Chief of Staff (COS) under Zia, published in 2001.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1998 Durrani was the chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factories Board. Mahmud He retired as a Major General of the Pakistan Army.\n\nDurrani was also an advisor in the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, which he served from 2001 to 2004. After retiring from the Pakistani Army, he was actively involved in the peace efforts between Pakistan and India. As part of a process sponsored by the United Nations, he also worked with former senior officials from the United States, Russia and Iran to find a peaceful resolution to the Afghan crisis.\n\nDurrani was appointed as Pakistan Ambassador to the United States by President Pervez Musharraf in June 2006, replacing another General Jehangir Karamat. They both belong to the Armoured corps of Pakistan Army, with Durrani being the third Armoured Corps officer to take the helms of ambassadorship at Washington, D.C.; the first one was Lt Gen Ejaz Azim, who was ambassador during General Zia-ul-Haq and Reagan era.\n\nDurrani was also called \"General Shanti\" by an Indian newspaper for his effort in trying to promote peace with India and Pakistan.\n\nDurrani was appointed National Security Adviser to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani in April 2008 at the behest of Asif Ali Zardari who at the time only held the post of co-chairman Pakistan Peoples Party (he became the President in September 2008). This was partly the reason why Durrani was fired from his job as NSA by Gillani for not \"taking Prime Minister into confidence\" about Kasab's nationality, even though Durrani had consulted the ISI chief who had in turn consulted the President Zardari before announcing that Ajmal Kasab was a Pakistani national.\n\nHis book \"India and Pakistan: The Cost of Conflict and the Benefits of Peace\" and \"Pakistan’s Security Imperatives: Year 2000 and Beyond\" argued that in the process of Indo-Pakistan normalisation, based on the Balusa Group's recommendations, Pakistan should take the initiative in \"re-engaging\" India after the 1999 Kargil operation and subsequent negative events associated with Pakistan policies. Strikingly, the stages of engagement outlined in the book were followed closely by President Pervez Musharraf after 2001: \"Preliminary Secret Contacts, Stage Two Secret Meetings, Summit, Follow-up Meetings.\"\n\nHe is the father of three children.\n\n"}
{"id": "38770905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38770905", "title": "Marion Coates Hansen", "text": "Marion Coates Hansen\n\nMarion Coates Hansen (\"née\" Coates; 3 June 1870 – 2 January 1947) was an English feminist and women's suffrage campaigner, an early member of the militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and a founder member of the Women's Freedom League (WFL) in 1907. She is generally credited with having influenced George Lansbury, the Labour politician and future party leader, to take up the cause of votes for women when she acted as his agent in the general election campaign of 1906. Lansbury became one of the strongest advocates for the women's cause in the pre-1914 era.\n\nHansen spent her almost her whole life in Middlesbrough, and was an active member of the local Independent Labour Party (ILP). Born into the well-to-do Coates family, she was drawn to socialism through her association with Joseph Fels, the American industrialist and social reformer for whom she worked as a nanny in Philadelphia in the early 1890s. She was one of a group who left the WSPU in protest against the increasingly autocratic attitudes of Emmeline Pankhurst and her family towards the organisation's general membership. After the First World War she took up local politics in Middlesbrough, became a local councillor in Middlesbrough, and was involved in housing reform and slum clearance. Her contributions to the cause of women's rights has largely been overlooked by historians, who have tended to concentrate on higher profile figures.\n\nLittle information has been published about Hansen's early life, education and upbringing. She was born Marion Coates in 1870 or 1871, in Osbaldwick, Yorkshire. While she was still a young child, the family moved to the Linthorpe district of Middlesbrough. Among her siblings were two older brothers: Charles and Walter, who became successful businessmen, and were associated with the American industrialist and social reformer Joseph Fels. Through the Fels connection Hansen travelled to Philadelphia, probably in the late 1880s or early 1890s, where she worked for a time as a nanny in the Fels household.\n\nDuring her American sojourn Hansen discovered and was inspired by the poetry and democratic philosophy of Walt Whitman. On her return to England she became an active proponent of socialism and women's rights, using the pages of the radical socialist journal \"Justice\" to attack the standard Victorian male prejudices concerning the roles of women in society. When one leading socialist opined that women ought to be \"captivated and charmed by the beauties and possibilities of socialism\", Hansen wrote a condemnatory reply in \"Justice\" magazine: \"We women are not going to be bought like goodies ... We are coming as comrades, friends, warriors to a state worthy of us, not to dolldom\". Around 1900 she married Frederick Hansen, a member of a well-to-do Middlesbrough family with socialistic beliefs. The Hansen and the Coates families were influential members of the local Independent Labour Party (ILP), in which Marion Hansen, as branch secretary, was the driving force; she, her family and their associates were known in local socialist circles as \"the Linthorpe set\". From time to time this group's influence and their paternalistic attitudes, in particular their permanent control over the branch's executive committee, caused resentment among the more working class membership. Another point of contention was the conflict of interest between Hansen's ILP duties and her growing interest in the politics of feminism. In 1903, when the Women's Social and Political Union was founded to promote the cause of women's suffrage, Hansen became an early member.\n\nThe WPSU, founded in 1903, was a breakaway movement from the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) which, led by Millicent Fawcett, promoted the cause of women's suffrage by gradualist, law-abiding methods. Certain NUWSS members, led by Emmeline Pankhurst and her family, wanted a more active strategy and a more specific goal: to secure voting rights for women on the same basis as for men. They founded the WPSU with the motto \"Deeds not Words\", and the new body began to build an activist membership. Initially, the WPSU did not promote the kinds of disruptive actions which later became its hallmark; the change in tactic occurred in 1905, when it appeared that reform via the parliamentary route was doomed to failure. In February 1905 the Liberal opposition MP, Bamford Slack, introduced a bill to the House of Commons, which would give votes to women in parliamentary elections. When the bill was debated on 12 May, it was \"talked out\" by its opponents and was not put to the vote. Sensing that the Liberals would soon become the governing party, the WSPU sought assurances from the party's spokesmen that they would, when in power, legislate on votes for women. The failure of the Liberal leadership to give this commitment led to the adoption by the WSPU of more aggressive tactics. From the autumn onwards Liberal party meetings were regularly heckled and harassed; Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney were imprisoned after disrupting a meeting in Manchester, obstructing the police and refusing to pay the fine.\n\nHansen's first recorded contribution to the WSPU cause came in September 1905. Anticipating that a general election would be held in the near future, she secured the candidacy of the socialist activist George Lansbury in the Middlesbrough constituency, on a programme that included a specific commitment to votes for women. Lansbury was a local councillor and Poor Law guardian in Poplar, a tireless worker among the poor and disadvantaged of the East End of London. He became known to Hansen through the Coates family's connection with Joseph Fels, who had worked with Lansbury in the organisation of work schemes to assist the unemployed. In 1889 Lansbury had acted as agent for Jane Cobden when she was elected to the London County Council, and was known to Emmeline Pankhurst who had campaigned for him at Walworth during the 1895 general election. Since the Cobden election, Lansbury's priorities had shifted to poverty and unemployment.\n\nBecause the local ILP was bound by a secret election pact with the Liberals to support the Liberal candidate, Joseph Havelock Wilson, they could not endorse Lansbury. Hansen tried without success to bypass this restriction. She wrote to Ramsay MacDonald, the secretary of the Labour Representation Committee, pointing out the advantages for the Labour movement in supporting a candidate such as Lansbury, but MacDonald was unable to help; Lansbury stood as an independent socialist. Hansen persuaded Lansbury to include in his election address not only a commitment to women's enfranchisement but other radical socialist policies: Irish Home Rule, state pensions, full employment and trade union recognition. Her close involvement with Lansbury's campaign—she acted as his agent—angered some in her local party, but she fulfilled her duties with calm efficiency; according to Shepherd she \"displayed the essential quality of any agent ... to maintain optimism in all situations, whatever the daunting difficulties\". Her husband Frederick acted as campaign treasurer, and most of costs was borne by Fels and Walter Coates. Nevertheless, when the election came in January 1906, Lansbury's socialist brew proved too much for what his biographer John Shepherd describes as \"the mainly working-class, all-male electorate\", and Lansbury was heavily defeated. Wilson received 9,227 votes, his Conservative opponent 6,846 and Lansbury 1,484—less than 9 percent of the total vote.\n\nHansen was primarily responsible in introducing Lansbury to and educating him in the issue of women's suffrage, a fact that he acknowledged when writing to her in October 1912. Shepherd writes that in due course, \"gender was to replace social class at the head of his concerns and preoccupations\" and votes for women became for him the overwhelming question of the day. After Lansbury finally entered parliament in 1910 he expressed to Hansen his lack of faith in the ability of his fellow-Labour MPs to secure women's enfranchisement, despite the party by then having a formal policy commitment. In 1912 Lansbury resigned his parliamentary seat—against Hansen's passionate pleas against such action—to fight for it on the single issue of votes for women; Hansen was devastated when he lost the ensuing by-election: \"a more unhappy time I have never lived through\". In August 1913 Lansbury was imprisoned for incitement, after publicly supporting the militant tactics of the suffragist bodies which had by then passed well beyond the threshold of lawfulness. Although he was quickly released, Hansen wrote to him with approval: \"You have done a big thing for us. It ... shows how far in the dark ages we still are, especially in matters concerning the welfare of women\".\n\nHansen's concerns for Lansbury extended to his family, especially to his wife Bessie with whom she formed a warm and lasting friendship. She felt that Bessie needed a break from her responsibilities for her large family, and invited her to stay in Middlesbrough for a holiday: \"The boys can look after the [younger] children, the girls can cook dinner and Mr Lansbury can darn his socks\".\n\nIn the year following the January 1906 general election, won by the Liberals with a large majority, the WSPU was active in a number of by-election contests. Hansen took part in several of these campaigns. At Cockermouth in August 1906, a divergence of view arose within the WSPU over whether Robert Smillie, the ILP candidate, should be supported. Smillie favoured women's suffrage in a general way, but was not a declared supporter; he shared with most Labour MPs the view that trade union reforms should take precedence over women's issues. Christabel Pankhurst and others decided on a separate campaign against all three declared candidates, and accordingly arranged rival meetings. This created difficulties for those such as Hansen and Mary Gawthorpe, who had strong ILP loyalties. Although Gawthorpe spoke on behalf of Smillie, Hansen followed Christabel's line, a course of action that further antagonised her local ILP and caused her temporary resignation from the secretaryship.\n\nIn her memoirs written many years later, the suffragist Hannah Mitchell provides a number of glimpses of Hansen during the 1906–10 period. Mitchell remembers her campaigning during a by-election at Huddersfield in November; a little later, while leading a series of meetings, Mitchell caught a chill: \"I became so ill that my hostess, Mrs Coates-Hanson, put me to bed at once ... Thanks to her kindness I managed to get through all the meetings, and she insisted on my staying a few days to rest. The Hanson home was lovely, and it was the first time in my life I had ever been waited on, and nursed, while the beautiful courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Hanson to each other, and to their guests, made those few days like a glimpse of Paradise\".\n\nThe WSPU continued to grow rapidly, but many members were become increasingly dissatisfied by the organisation's lack of democracy and its detachment from the Labour movement. The historian Martin Pugh remarks that to many, \"[the WSPU] represented no more than a small central coterie that took little notice of its members' opinions\". When in September 1907 Emmeline Pankhurst abandoned the constitution and appointed an executive committee of her own nominees a number of members, including Hansen, left the WSPU and formed the Women's Freedom League (WFL). The WFL, while fully committed to the activist struggle, adopted a democratic constitution. It collected many of the WSPU's working class members and promoted better relations with the Labour movement in parliament. Hansen, together with Charlotte Despard and Teresa Billington-Greig joined the WFL's initial executive committee.\n\nDespite her role in the formation of the WFL, there are few records of Hansen's activities on its behalf, although her correspondence with Lansbury in the years up to 1914 indicates that she remained passionately committed to the cause of women's suffrage. She may have been one of the WFL members who attempted to petition King Edward VII at the State Opening of Parliament on 29 January 1908, and may have participated in the mass pickets of the House of Commons and 10 Downing Street, organised by the WFL in the summer of 1909. Hansen's future sister-in-law Alice Schofield (she married Charles Coates in 1910) had greater visibility; an active WFL organiser, she was imprisoned in 1909 for her part in a demonstration at the House of Commons. Although the two women shared common political and ideological concerns, they were not close; Alice Coates's daughter Marion Johnson, interviewed in 1975, revealed that the two disliked each other, and where possible kept their distance.\n\nAfter the First World War, during which the women's suffrage campaign was largely suspended, Hansen does not appear to have resumed her WFL activities. In 1919 she and Alice Coates became the first women elected to Middlesbrough Borough Council–Coates was elected a week before Hansen. The two were among the very few active suffragists who took up local politics. Hansen's main concerns as a councillor were related to slum clearance and housing; during the 1930s she spoke against the indiscriminate destruction of properties in the historic district of St Hilda's, maintaining that many houses scheduled for demolition \"possessed fine elevations and interiors which make fault finding a difficult task\".\n\nFrom 1911 Hansen, who was childless, lived with her husband in the Nunthorpe district of the town. Later, after Frederick Hansen's death, Hansen lived in Great Ayton, outside Middlesbrough, where she died on 2 January 1947. Shepherd quotes Lansbury's description of Hansen as \"a very slightly built woman: her frail body possesses an iron will and a courageous spirit. The freedom for which she strove was one which would emancipate body, soul and spirit\".

{"id": "326775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326775", "title": "Northern Bavarian", "text": "Northern Bavarian\n\nNorthern Bavarian is a dialect of the Bavarian language, together with Central Bavarian and Southern Bavarian. The language is mostly spoken in the Upper Palatinate, although not in Regensburg, which is a primarily Central Bavarian–speaking area, according to a linguistic survey done in the late 1980s. According to the same survey, Northern Bavarian is also spoken in Upper Franconia, as well as in some areas in Upper and Lower Bavaria, such as in the areas around Eichstätt and Kelheim. Few speakers remained in the Czech Republic, mostly concentrated around Aš and Železná Ruda, at the time of the survey, but considering the time which has passed since the survey, the dialect may be extinct in those places today. If it still exists there, it would include the \"ostegerländische Dialektgruppe\". Ethnologue estimates that there were 9,000 speakers of Bavarian Czech Republic in 2005, but does not clarify if these were Northern Bavarian speakers.\n\nAccording to the same linguistic survey, the dialect is flourishing in the areas where it is spoken, despite the fact that most speakers actively use Standard German. In the south of the area where Northern Bavarian is spoken, Central Bavarian is said to have higher prestige, and Northern Bavarian characteristics are therefore not as visible as in the north, where speakers even tend to use a heavy Northern Bavarian accent when speaking German.\n\nNorthern Bavarian has 8 vowels:\n\nAnd 11 diphthongs:\n\nBefore , are rounded to .\n\nIn southern varieties of Northern Bavarian the diphthongs are realized with an opener offset, i.e. .\n\nAn interesting aspect of the diphthongs are the so-called \"reversed diphthongs\", or in German, \"gestürzte Diphthonge\". They are called so because the Middle High German diphthongs became ( became after unrounding) in Northern Bavarian, while they generally became in Standard German. Compare Standard German \"Brief\" , \"Bruder\" , \"Brüder\" and Northern Bavarian , , .\n\nThe Northern Bavarian diphthong corresponds to the Middle High German and Standard German . Compare Standard German \"Schaf\" , \"Stroh\" and Northern Bavarian , . Likewise, the Northern Bavarian diphthong corresponds to the Middle High German and Standard German and by unrounding to . Compare Standard German \"Schnee\" , \"böse\" with Northern Bavarian , .\n\nIn many Northern Bavarian variants, nasalization is increasingly common.\n\nNorthern Bavarian has about 33 consonants:\n\nAll nouns in Northern Bavarian one of have three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter. Many nouns have the same gender as in Standard German, but there are many exceptions. An example is \"Benzin\", which is neuter in Standard German, but masculine in Northern Bavarian. Another example is \"Butter\", which is feminine in Standard German, but can be all three genders in Northern Bavarian depending on where in the Northern Bavarian–speaking you are.\n\nAs in Standard German there are four cases in Northern Bavarian: nominative, accusative, genitive and dative. The genitive case, however, is uncommon and is commonly replaced either with the dative and a possessive pronoun or with the preposition \"von\" and the dative, e.g. , or \"father's house\". An exception is the genitive instead of the dative after the singular possessive pronouns, e.g. , which is as correct as \"behind me\". Prepositions take the dative or the accusative, but not the genitive, e.g. (formally ) \"despite the rain\". The dative ending -m often sounds like the accusative ending -n (see the previous example), so that these two cases are not distinguishable.\n\nNouns in Northern Bavarian are inflected for number, and to a lesser extent, case. Inflecting for number is common across all three genders, and especially umlaut is productive, in particular in masculine nouns. The most common plural marker in feminine nouns is , while it is with most neuter nouns. Many nouns, across the genders, are the same in the plural as in the singular.\n\nWeak masculine nouns are inflected in the accusative and dative case, most commonly with suffixation of a nasal consonant, such as or , while the other cases remain uninflected. Many weak feminine nouns have the ending in most cases, though not to be confused with the plural ending. Weak neuter nouns have almost been lost, with only strong remaining, and therefore inflection for case is basically nonexistent.\n\nThe inflection of adjectives in Northern Bavarian differ depending on whether the adjective is preceded by a definite article or a demonstrative, or if it is preceded by an indefinite article or a possessive, or if it is used as a predicate, of which the latter is only present in some varieties. Adjectives without any determiner rarely occur.\n\nBelow can the inflectional paradigms be seen, with the adjective serving as an example. This is also the form used in all situations, when the adjective is used as a predicate, and therefore no paradigm is needed. Compare Northern Bavarian with the Standard German \"alt\", in English \"old\".\n\nThe predicate form of an adjective differ from the other forms, not only because it is the basic form, but also because it has a long vowel, unlike the other forms, as in above. Other examples include and , which become and , respectively. Compare with the Standard German \"gross\" and \"breit\", in English \"big\" and \"broad\".\n\nComparative adjectives are formed by suffixing , and superlative adjectives are formed by suffixing . Vowel changes often take place when the suffixation happens. An example is , which becomes when comparative and when superlative. Compare with the Standard German \"hoch\", \"höher\" and \"höchsten\", in English \"high\", \"higher\" and \"highest\".\n\nThe pronouns of Northern Bavarian differ slightly from variety to variety. Furthermore, there are two pairs of pronouns, one used when in stressed position and the other used when unstressed.\n\nThere is no gender distinction in the plural.\n\nThe ending in the stressed first person singular nominative and -accusative and in stressed the second person singular accusative is only present in northern- and western varieties of Northern Bavarian.\n\nAt the time of a linguistic survey carried out in the late 1980s, pronouns also existed for unstressed first person plural accusative and unstressed second person plural accusative, and , respectively, but they have probably fallen out of usage today.\n\nVerbs in Northern Bavarian are conjugated for person, tense and mood. The Northern Bavarian verbs are also subject to both vowel change and apophony.\n\nThe non-finite forms have one three endings: , and . The first ending is rare, and is only present in some few monosyllabic verbs, such as , Standard German \"sein\", English \"to be\"; , Standard German \"gehen\", English \"to go\"; , Standard German \"stehen\", English \"to stand\"; and , Standard German \"tun\", English \"to do\". The second ending is the most common ending found on most verbs, such as , Standard German \"bitten\", English \"to ask\". The third ending is used with verbs having a certain stem-final consonant, such as , Standard German \"singen\", English \"to sing\".\n\nThe personal endings for the present tense differ slightly from variety to variety, but are largely uniform. The endings in the scheme below are attached to the stem, and not the non-finite form. The stem is found by removing the non-finite ending, if it is or .\n\nAs can be seen in the scheme above, the first person singular is basically the same as the stem, and the first- and third persons plural are the same as the non-finite form. Furthermore, the third person singular is realized as - when occurring before a fortis obstruent, and that in some southern varieties of Northern Bavarian the first person plural has the ending -, and therefore isn't the non-finite form.\n\nThe singular imperative is the same as the first person singular, and the plural imperative is the same as the second person plural. Only one exception exists, which is the imperative of , Standard German \"sein\", English \"to be\", which is .\n\nOnly one verb with a distinct simple past tense form remains, , Standard German \"sein\", English \"to be\", with the simple past tense form , Standard German \"war\", English \"was\". The past tense of other verbs is formed in the same way as Standard German uses \"haben\" or \"sein\", English \"to have\" and \"to be\", respectively, and the past participle.\n\nThe past participle in Northern Bavarian is formed by the prefix -, although not on verbs beginning with a plosive consonant, where the prefix is left out. Thus we see , Standard German \"geschüttet\", English \"shaken\"; , Standard German \"genommen\", English \"taken\"; , Standard German \"gebracht\", English \"brought\"; and , Standard German \"getragen\", English \"carried\".\n\nThe verbs and , Standard German \"haben\" and \"sein\", English \"to have\" and \"to be\", can be seen conjugated in the scheme below in the present, as they are irregular. They have the past participles, and , respectively. Compare with Standard German \"gehaben\" and \"gewesen\", English \"had\" and \"been\".\n\nExamples can be seen below:\n\nIt is quite straightforward to form the subjunctive in Northern Bavarian. The subjunctive of verbs is formed with the suffix -, as in > , Standard German \"wissen\" > \"wüßte\", English \"to know\" > \"I would know\".\n\nBoth weak verbs and strong verbs may undergo apophony. The strong verbs can be split into two groups: the first group where the vowel in the non-finite form is the same as in the past participle; and the second group where the vowel in the non-finite form is different from the vowel in the past participle. The most common vowel gradations in the second group can be seen below:\n\n\nApophony is not as common with weak verbs as in Standard German. However, the number of weak verbs with morphophonological variations is high, especially change in vowel length is common.\n\nThis is a phonetic transcription of a text in Northern Bavarian, with translations in German and English.\n"}

{"id": "43848168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43848168", "title": "Project Guardian", "text": "Project Guardian\n\nProject Guardian is a joint initiative between British Transport Police (BTP), the Metropolitan Police Service (\"the Met\"), the City of London Police, and Transport for London (TfL), which aims to combat and increase reporting of sexual harassment on public transport in London. The initiative was inspired by a similar operation in Boston, Massachusetts, and began after a TfL survey revealed that 15% of women who used London's public transport had experienced some form of unwanted sexual behaviour, but that the overwhelming majority of incidents were not reported to the police. Project Guardian aimed to increase reporting and reduce instances of such behaviour.\n\nAs part of the project, the police created a confidential hotline and text-messaging service and used social media to raise awareness and encourage reporting. They also staged several \"weeks of action\", involving increased patrolling of public transport by both uniformed and plain-clothed police officers, including a joint initiative with police officers in several cities in North America, several of which resulted in multiple arrests. In August 2014, the BTP recorded a 21% increase in sex offences, a rise which was attributed partially to increased reporting as result of Project Guardian.\n\nProject Guardian was launched in April 2013, after a survey conducted by Transport for London (TfL) reported widespread fear of sexual harassment among women who use London's public transport, and that 15% of female respondents had encountered unwanted sexual behaviour while using public transport, though around 90% of incidents went unreported. It is a joint venture between British Transport Police (BTP), which polices the rail and metro networks; the Metropolitan Police Service's Safer Transport Command, which is responsible for policing of buses in most of London; the City of London Police; and TfL.\n\nThe project was launched with the aim of encouraging the reporting of incidents and creating an atmosphere on public transport which does not tolerate sexual harassment. Addressing the issue of \"victim blaming\" (in which victims are held partially or entirely responsible for their harassment) BTP Inspector Ricky Twyford, manager of Project Guardian, stated \"We don't want anyone to have to change their behaviour to prevent becoming a victim; the only people whose behaviour should change are those who are perpetrating this activity\".\n\nThe project, reported to be the largest campaign of its kind, was inspired by a similar initiative run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in Boston which doubled the level of reporting of sexual offences on the MBTA's network.\n\nProject Guardian began with the BTP giving its 2,000 London-based officers specialist training in handling reports of sexual offences, with guidance from three of the UK's leading women's rights groups, the End Violence Against Women Coalition, Hollaback!, and the Everyday Sexism Project. The public launch of the project was with a week-long Twitter chat, hosted by the BTP and the Everyday Sexism Project using the hashtag \"#ProjGuardian\", which was intended to raise awareness of Project Guardian and to encourage greater reporting of sexual offences, including reporting incidents in real time via Twitter. The police set up a dedicated, confidential telephone hotline and text-messaging service, which were widely publicised to encourage reporting. Project Guardian also covers police attempts to deter unwanted sexual behaviour on public transport, including increased patrols by highly visible and plain-clothed officers.\n\nIn early April 2014, officers from Project Guardian were involved in a trans-Atlantic initiative known as \"Global Guardian\", in which police in Vancouver, Washington DC, Boston, and London all increased patrols on public transport networks and attempted to raise awareness of the initiative among passengers. \n\nAmong the tactics police use to deter and detect sexual offences as part of Project Guardian are \"weeks of action\", which involve large numbers of additional police officers, both high-visibility and in plain clothes, patrolling the transport network in order to raise awareness, gather intelligence, and detect offences. One of the first, in August 2013, involved 185 police officers and resulted in nine arrests. In a week of action in September 2013, police used Twitter to raise awareness of the initiative, and the crackdown resulted in 15 people being arrested. Another, held in March 2014, resulted in 16 arrests.\n\nProject Guardian was largely praised by campaigners, but shortly after its launch there were calls for the initiative to be extended beyond London.\nIn October 2013, seven months after the public launch of Project Guardian, the police recorded a 20% increase in reporting of sexual offences on public transport, and a 32% increase in detections. By August 2014, the BTP had recorded a 21% increase in recorded sexual offences across the British railway network, which the chief constable, Paul Crowther, attributed partly to increased reporting as a result of Project Guardian.\n"}

Concerned about an inevitable confrontation with much larger Russian military units who were still quartered on the base, he refused the order on behalf of his company. On 23 July, Aleksander Einseln issued an order relieving Kommer from duty and directing him to take a training course for officers, but Kommer also refused this order. On 25 July, the company expressed their support for Kommer and announced they'd \"withdraw\" from Estonian military command structure.\n\nEstonian government responded by demobilising the whole unit on 27 July, but once again, the company refused the order. The next day, the company left the facilities of Paldiski and went to Pullapää. Estonian military moved the Kuperjanov battalion, complete with armour units, to Jägala, and, by all appearance, prepared for an attack, but this didn't, in the end, happen. However, Kommer's company, who had received a rumour that the President, Lennart Meri, had ordered an attack to begin at 16:00 on 31 July, prepared for such attack, and a number of members of the Defence League, as well as several women, joined the company in the preparations. The rumour's source has not been tracked down.\n\nOn 2 August, Estonian Internal Security Service arrested Jaak Mosin, a deputy leader of the (by then, demobilised) company Kommer was leading. As a response, the company withdrew its 25 June statement. On 3 August, Hain Rebas, the minister of defence, resigned. The military opposition wound down, and the crisis was further handled as a criminal rather than military matter.\n\nOn 12 August, a criminal investigation was launched against Asso Kommer and Jaak Mosin, on suspicion of abuse of power.\n\nOn 4 September, Asso Kommer and two other men took a businessman, Pavel Kalmõkov, into their car in Tallinn, and Kalmõkov ended up missing. (Later, on 9 December, Kommer directed the investigators to the place of Kalmõkov's burial.) On 12 September, Jaak Mosin, who had been released pending investigation, fled to Sweden and requested political asylum. On 26 November, a firefight between Kommer and police occurred, under unclear circumstances, and Koit Pikaro and Argo Aunapuu, two police officials, end up wounded by bullets fired by Kommer. However, Kommer was successfully arrested the same day. On the next day, however, Lagle Parek, Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs, resigned over the incident.\n\nOn 26 November 1993, Asso Kommer was convicted of several crimes of these events, and sentenced to six years and six months of imprisonment.\n\nComparable incidents of military insurrections also happened in Latvia and Lithuania around the same time. Accordingly, Johannes Kert, an Estonian general, has expressed his conclusion that these were incited by a common foreign agent. No foreign involvement in any of these incidents has been proven; however, it is known that a member of Russian Federation's army had offered Russian citizenship to the whole company, \"should the need arise\".\n\nA commonly cited background for the incident is Estonian military administrators' inability to organise acceptable living standards, and an approach, considered by some provocative or overly bureaucratic, towards the soldiers' petitions and complaints. (At least two such petitions by members of the Jäägrikompanii had gone unanswered, and a third had been answered on basis of insubordination rather than addressing the issues presented.) These problems might have ended triggering the active rebellion when the restationing order was issued.\n\nHowever, the restationing order itself is surrounded by obscurity. Several months later, Hain Rebas, the Estonian Minister of Defence who resigned over the incident, testified to a governmental commission that he didn't know who had initiated the restationing. Asso Kommer has declared that the order was a provocation by the Estonian Army's staff of generals, and that it is this provocation that led to the unit's withdrawal from Estonian military command structure.\n\nIt is also generally accepted, and explicitly stated by Lagle Parek, the Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs who resigned over the incident, that several opposition politicians used the incident's background in an opportunist manner, to deliberately incite the conflict. Jüri Pihl has traced Kommer's support to Tiit Made, Kalle Eller, Jüri Toomepuu, Katrin Linde, and noted the company's contacts with Hardo Aasmäe, Tiit Madisson and Jüri Põld.\n\nHain Rebas has implied that the incident was masterminded by Tiit Made, who, according to him, might have been plotting a military coup. This was supported by circumstantial evidence collected during the criminal investigation; however, this evidence didn't lead to any further convictions. Made, nor any other politician (of 1993) has never been officially charged with the rebellion, or incitement to rebellion. (Asso Kommer's official political career began only in 2006, when he applied for membership of Keskerakond, but the application has been stalled for more than a year.)\n\nOn the other hand, Jüri Toomepuu, who publicly supported activities of Jäägrikompanii, claimed that Trivimi Velliste's activities were influenced by a foreign power or foreign powers.\n\nKalle Kulbok, a member of Riigikogu during the time and a leader of the Independent Royalist Party of Estonia, has said that the military preparations were centered on containment rather than attack, and Estonian army would only have fired if the Jäägrikompanii would have fired first.\n\nIn the 1990s, police suspected that members of the Jäägrikompanii were involved in murdering and burial of about 30 ethnic Russians involved with the (now probably defunct) Perm mafia group. The company might have considered itself one of few forces capable of avoiding a supposed invasion by Russian organised crime interests. The company might in this context have behaved largely as a mere military arm of the Linnuvabriku mafia group consisting mostly of ethnic Estonians. (The Linnuvabriku group and the Perm mafia group were involved in the so-called \"metal war\" over possession of large coloured metal shipments. In particular, a shipment of cobalt has been implicated.)\n\nFor an example, an incident involving Jäägrikompanii members forcing to stop several members of the Perm mafia group, whose corpses were later found in Jõgevamaa, buried in a farm belonging to a Linnuvabriku mafioso's mother.\n\n"}

The movie is one of the first documentaries to address the myths and social taboos around masturbation. The trailer for \"Sticky: A (Self) Love Story\" was selected as top trailers of the week by IndieWire.\n\nThe feature-length documentary has received positive reviews in national media for its controversial stance in favor of masturbation as part of sex education. The filmmaker Nicholas Tana was paid to speak during a screening of his film at the 47th. annual American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) conference in Minneapolis in 2015 during which time an early educational cut of the film was screened in front of over a hundred certified sex educators. \n\nThe AASECT screening resulted in invitations to conduct educational screenings at Arizona State University sponsored by VOX Voices For Planned Parenthood, University of Wisconsin sponsored by Sex Outloud, and Eastern Michigan University spearheaded by Pam Landau of the Psychology department in April 2016 and ending in May 2016 in honor of international Masturbation Month. \n\nThe film addresses the need for sex education that discusses masturbation in a healthy manner to students; it includes interviewees with sex educators who express concerns about not properly educating children around sex and masturbation. The Harvard University screened \"Sticky: A (Self) Love Story\" on campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts on April 4, 2017, as part of Harvard's Sex week.\n\nFull of interviews from sex educators, religious figures, and psychologists, the documentary offers often contrasting opinions about the health benefits both physically and psychologically of masturbation. Among those interviewed who belief masturbation could be harmful is Alexander Rhodes, the founder of a popular Reddit masturbation abstinence group called NoFap. The movie also includes health findings associated with a Cambridge Study that link masturbation to prostate cancer, and a Chinese medical doctor's warning about the impact too much masturbation could have on a men's health and vitality.\n\nThese perspectives are contrasted with sex-positive statements from notable sex educators who speak in favor of the health benefits of masturbation. The film also references a medical study written in JAMA indicating that masturbation might help to prevent prostate cancer.\n\nThe film contains interviews with some of the founding members of the sex positive feminism movement. These interviewees include Nina Hartley, Betty Dodson, Joani Blank, and Carol Queen. Judy Norsidian and Wendy Sanford who worked for many years on the publication of the historical sex education book \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" both appear in the film.\n\n\"Sticky: A (Self) Love Story\" traces societal shame and guilt affiliated with masturbation to events in history and religious beliefs, and calls into question how this may influence politics and scientific study. Among the issues discussed in the film is the Anti-Obscenity Act that bans the sale of sex toys in the state of Alabama, and the contradictory stances of four major religions surrounding masturbation, which include Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism.\n\nOther topics include the controversial firing of the first African American Surgeon General by former U.S. President Bill Clinton; the career damaging fall out after Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) arrest in an adult theater for masturbating in public; current debates concerning sex education; the billion dollar sex toy industry; contradictory prostate cancer studies linked to male masturbation; the media obsession with sex addiction and sexual compulsion; the FBI study that links compulsive masturbation to serial killers; the impact of pornography on relationships; opinions as to the future of masturbation.\n\nThe film contains an interview with the first African American appointed as Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders about why she was fired by former president Bill Clinton for her controversial statement on world's AIDS day in favor of sex education on masturbation, an interview with comedian Janeane Garofalo about her embarrassment on doing the phone sex masturbation scene in \"The Truth About Cats And Dogs\", and an interview with \"Hustler\" creator Larry Flynt about how he came to discover masturbation.\n\nThe impact of masturbation on the media is explored through a series of movie clips and music. Film Threat founder and film critic, Chris Gore, states in the documentary that most instances of masturbation depicted in movies or television are seen as either grotesque or as something one wouldn't want to be caught doing. This comment is substantiated by clips from movies like \"The Exorcist\" and \"American Pie\" shown in the film. \n\nTelevision clips from the \"Seinfeld\" episode called \"The Contest\" and a clip from \"Sex in the City\" are also discussed, along with songs that make reference to masturbation in some way. A section in the film on Masturbation and Media includes interviews with comedian ANT, and Keith Morris, singer/songwriter formerly of Black Flag and The Circle Jerks. The movie features an acoustic performance of the song \"Touch Myself\" played by songwriter Billy Steinberg who is also interviewed in the documentary.\n\nFirst distributed in time for Valentine's Day in February 2016 by Vision Films Inc a partner of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in February 2016, \"Sticky: A (Self) Love Story\" has been selected as an Amazon Video Direct Stars (AVD) winner in July 2016 after being one of Amazon's top selling films online. At the time of this article, the documentary is being distributed in the USA, Canada, UK, Italy, Israel, Brazil, and Germany.\n\nThere have been numerous theatrical screenings of \"Sticky: A (Self) Love Story\" around the world. These includes screenings in New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego and sold out screenings at MoSex in New York, Syndicated in Brooklyn, and the historic Chinese Theater in Hollywood, California. \"Sticky: A (Self) Love Story\" opened at the first annual Lov Doc Film Festival in Moscow, Russia in 2016.\n\nThe documentary has appeared in news articles from around the world that include: \"Newsweek\", \"The Daily Dot\", \"The Daily Beast\", \"Indiewire\", \"Salon\", \"GQ Mexico\", \"New York Magazine\", \"Bustle\", \"Bust\", and the popular Brazilian publication \"Folha De S.

The language is also spoken by the Iwe, Toka and Leya people, and perhaps by the Kafwe Twa (if they are not Ila), as well as many bilingual Zambians and Zimbabweans.\n\nIt is one of the major lingua francas in Zambia, together with Bemba, Lozi and Nyanja. The Tonga of Malawi, which is classified by Guthrie as belonging to zone N15, is not particularly close to Zambian Tonga, which is classified as zone M64, and can be considered a separate language.\n\nThe Tonga-speaking inhabitants are the oldest Bantu settlers, with the Tumbuka, a small ethnic group in the east, in what is now known as Zambia. There are two distinctive dialects of Tonga; Valley Tonga and Plateau Tonga. Valley Tonga is mostly spoken in the Zambezi valley and southern areas of the Batonga (Tonga people) while Plateau Tonga is spoken more around Monze District and the northern areas of the Batonga.\n\nTonga (Chitonga or iciTonga) developed as a spoken language and was not put into written form until missionaries arrived in the area. The language is not standardized, and speakers of the same dialect may have different spellings for the same words once put into written text.\n\nAt least some speakers have a bilabial nasal click where neighboring dialects have /mw/, as in \"mwana\" 'child' and \"kumwa\" 'to drink'.\n\nMaho (2009) removes Shanjo as a separate, and not very closely related, language.\n\nTonga follows the standard Bantu language structure. A single word may incorporate a subject-marker, a tense-marker, a direct object, and even an indirect object, combined with the verb root itself.\n\nTonga is a tonal language, with high and low-toned syllables. The placement of the tones is complex and differs from that of other Bantu languages; for example, a syllable which is low in Tonga may be high in the cognate word in other Bantu languages and vice versa. Several scholars, beginning with A. E. Meeussen in 1963, have tried to discover the rules for where to place the tones. \n\nOne feature of the tonal system is that high tones tend to get disassociated from their original place and move to the left, as is illustrated in these examples:\n\nIn these words, the original high tone of the root \"-sí\" has moved to the prefix \"ibu-\", whereas the low tone of \"-su\" has not affected the prefix.\n\nThe above example of a noun is relatively easy to explain. However, the tones of the verbal system are more complex. An example of one of the puzzles discussed by both Meeussen and Goldsmith can be seen below:\n\n\nThe high tone on the tense-marker \"la\" in the fourth verb is puzzling. If it comes from the verb root \"bon\", it is hard to see why it does not also appear in the 1st person \"ndi-la-bon-a\". \n\nSome scholars, such as Carter and Goldsmith, have analysed Tonga as having both tones and accents (the accents in Tonga being mainly on low-toned syllables). Others, such as Pulleyblank, analyse the same data purely in terms of tonal rules, without the need to introduce accents.\n\n"}
{"id": "519331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=519331", "title": "Ulster Scots people", "text": "Ulster Scots people\n\nThe Ulster Scots (Ulster-Scots: \"Ulstèr-Scotch\"), also called Ulster Scots people (\"Ulstèr-Scotch fowk\") or, outside the British Isles, Scots-Irish (\"Scotch-Airisch\"), are an ethnic group in Ireland, found mostly in the province of Ulster and to a lesser extent in the rest of Ireland. Their ancestors were mostly Protestant Presbyterians Lowland Scottish migrants, the largest numbers coming from Galloway, Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and the Scottish Borders, with others coming from further north in the Scottish Lowlands and, to a much lesser extent, from the Highlands.\n\nThese Scots migrated to Ireland in large numbers both as a result of the government-sanctioned Plantation of Ulster, a planned process of colonisation which took place under the auspices of James VI of Scotland and I of England on land confiscated from members of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland who fled Ulster and as part of a larger migration or unplanned wave of settlement.\n\nUlster Scots emigrated onwards from Ireland in significant numbers to what is now the United States and to all corners of the then-worldwide British Empire—what are now Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, to British India and to a lesser extent to Argentina and Chile. Scotch-Irish (or Scots-Irish) is a traditional term for Ulster Scots who emigrated to North America.\n\nThe first major influx of border English and Lowland Scots into Ulster came in the first two decades of the 17th century.\n\nFirst, before the Plantation of Ulster and even before the Flight of the Earls, there was the 1606 independent Scottish settlement in east Down and Antrim. It was led by adventurers James Hamilton and Sir Hugh Montgomery, two Ayrshire lairds. Montgomery was granted half of Conn O'Neill's land as a reward for helping him escape from prison. Hamilton forced himself in on this deal when he discovered it and, after three years of bickering, the final settlement gave Hamilton and Montgomery each one-third of the land.\n\nStarting in 1609, Scots began arriving into state-sponsored settlements as part of the Plantation of Ulster. This scheme was intended to confiscate all the lands of the Gaelic Irish nobility in Ulster and to settle the province with Protestant Scottish and English colonists. Under this scheme, a substantial number of Scots were settled, mostly in the south and west of Ulster, on confiscated land. \n\nWhile many of the Scottish planters in Ulster came from southwest Scotland, a large number came from the southeast, including the unstable regions right along the border with England (the Scottish Borders and Northumberland). These groups were from the Borderers or Border Reivers culture, which had familial links on both sides of the Anglo-Scottish border. \nContrary to popular misinformation and due mainly to the simplification of Irish history for political agenda purposes, these Reivers were not all Protestants, many if not a majority would have been at least nominally Roman Catholics.\nThe plan was that moving these Borderers to Ireland would both solve the Borders problem and tie down Ulster. This was of particular concern to James VI of Scotland when he became King of England, since he knew Scottish instability could jeopardise his chances of ruling both kingdoms effectively.\n\nDuring the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the native Irish gentry attempted to extirpate the English and Scottish settlers in revenge for being driven off their ancestral land, resulting in severe violence, massacres and ultimately leading to the deaths of between four and six thousand settlers over the winter of 1641–42. Native Irish civilians were massacred in return. By 1642, native Irish were in \"de facto\" control of much of the island under a Confederate Ireland, with about a third under the control of the opposition. However, many Ulster-Scots Presbyterians joined with the Irish in rebellion and aided them in driving the English out.\n\nThe Ulster-Scottish population in Ireland was quite possibly preserved from complete annihilation during the subsequent Irish Confederate Wars, when a Scottish Covenanter army was landed in the province to protect the Ulster-Scottish settlers from native Irish landowners. The war itself, part of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, ended in the 1650s, with the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. At the head of the army, Oliver Cromwell conquered all of Ireland. Defeating the Irish Confederates and English Royalists on behalf of the English Parliamentarians, he and his forces employed methods and inflicted casualties among the civilian Irish population that have long been commonly considered by contemporary sources, historians and the popular culture to be outside of the accepted military ethics of the day (see more on the debate here). After the Cromwellian war in Ireland was over, many of their soldiers settled permanently in eastern Ulster.\n\nUnder the Act of Settlement 1652, all Catholic-owned land was confiscated and the British Plantations in Ireland, which had been destroyed by the rebellion of 1641, were restored. However, due to the Scots' enmity to the English Parliament in the final stages of the English Civil War, English settlers rather than Scots were the main beneficiary of this scheme.\n\nThere was a generation of calm in Ireland until another war broke out in 1689, again due to political conflict closely aligned with ethnic and religious differences. The Williamite war in Ireland (1689–91) was fought between Jacobites who supported the restoration of the Catholic James II to the throne of England and Williamites who supported the Protestant William of Orange. The majority of the Protestant colonists throughout Ireland but particularly in Ulster, fought on the Williamite side in the war against the Jacobites. The fear of a repeat of the massacres of 1641, fear of retribution for religious persecution, as well as their wish to hold on to lands which had been confiscated from Catholic landowners, were all principal motivating factors.\n\nThe Williamite forces, composed of British, Dutch, Huguenot and Danish armies, as well as troops raised in Ulster, ended Jacobite resistance by 1691, confirming the Protestant minority's monopoly on power in Ireland. Their victories at Derry, the Boyne and Aughrim are still commemorated by the Orange Order into the 21st century.\n\nFinally, another major influx of Scots into northern Ireland occurred in the late 1690s, when tens of thousands of people fled a famine in Scotland to come to Ulster.\n\nIt was only after the 1690s that Scottish settlers and their descendants, the majority of whom were Presbyterian, gained numeric superiority in Ulster, though still a minority in Ireland as a whole. Along with Catholics, they were legally disadvantaged by the Penal Laws, which gave full rights only to members of the Church of Ireland (the Anglican state church), who were mainly Anglo-Irish (themselves often absentee landlords), native Irish converts or the descendants of English settlers. For this reason, up until the 19th century, there was considerable disharmony between Dissenters and the ruling Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. With the enforcement of Queen Anne's 1703 Test Act, which caused further discrimination against all who did not participate in the established church, considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots migrated to the colonies in British America throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. In fact, these 'Scots-Irish' from Ulster and Lowland Scotland comprised the most numerous group of immigrants from Great Britain and Ireland to the American colonies in the years prior the American Revolution, with an estimated 150,000 leaving northern Ireland at the time.\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, many Ulster-Scots Presbyterians ignored religious differences and, along with many Catholic Gaelic Irish, joined the United Irishmen to participate in the Irish Rebellion of 1798 in support of republican and egalitarian ideals.\n\nJust a few generations after arriving in Ulster, considerable numbers of Ulster-Scots emigrated to the North American colonies of Great Britain. Between 1717 and 1775, an estimated 200,000 migrated to what became the United States of America. Around the same time, the British took control of the territory of New France, allowing many Ulster-Scots to migrate to these areas as well. These people are known as the Scotch-Irish Canadians.\n\nIn the United States Census of 2000, 4.3 million Americans (1.5% of the population of the United States) claimed Scotch-Irish ancestry. Author and former United States Senator Jim Webb suggests that the true number of people with some Scots-Irish heritage in the United States is more - over 27 million - possibly because contemporary Americans with some Scotch-Irish heritage may regard themselves as either Irish, Scottish, or simply American instead.\n\nOver the centuries, Ulster Scots culture has contributed to the unique character of the counties in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Scots Agency points to industry, language, music, sport, religion and myriad traditions brought to Ulster from the Scottish lowlands. In particular, the origin of country and Western music was extensively from Ulster Scots folk music. \n\nThe cultural traditions and aspects of this culture including its links to country music are articulated in David Hackett Fischer's book, \"\". In 2010's documentary \"The Hamely Tongue\", filmmaker Deaglán O Mocháin traces back the origins of this culture and language, and relates its manifestations in today's Ireland. The film's title refers to James Fenton's book, \"The Hamely Tongue: A personal record of Ulster-Scots in County Antrim.\" \n\nMost Ulster Scots speak Ulster English as a first language. Ulster Scots is the local dialect of the Lowland Scots language which has, since the 1980s, also been called \"Ullans\", a portmanteau neologism popularised by the physician, amateur historian and politician Dr Ian Adamson, merging \"Ulster\" and \"Lallans\"—the Scots for \"Lowlands\" —but also an acronym for \"Ulster-Scots language in literature and native speech\".\n\nThe North American ancestry of the X-linked form of the genetic disease congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus has been traced to Ulster Scots who came to Nova Scotia in 1761 on the ship \"Hopewell\".\n\n"}
{"id": "22842718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22842718", "title": "Urban theory", "text": "Urban theory\n\nUrban theory describes the city formation phenomenon where economic priorities prevail to facilitate the city’s propensity to generate and accumulate wealth. Such city formation involves some irreversible spatial investments, massive resource allocations and financial investments recoverable only if anticipated future income transpires. Consequently, it is a pertinent concept in urban planning. Though related, this is not to be confused with urban economics where economic principles and tools are applied at macro and micro levels. Urbanomics is to be understood as a paradigm to understand impact of the globalization process on urban development.\n\nUrban theory is an agglomeration of social theories - classical, neo-classical and modern. Reference to social theory assumes the indivisibility of political, social and economic forces. Sustainability is increasingly becoming the lynch-pin of urban studies with triple-line accountability (social, environment and economics) given more emphasis though not necessarily translated to practice. Here, urbanomics, by default, renders environmental and social concerns to subservience.\n\nTheoretical discourse has often polarized between economic determinism and cultural determinism with scientific or technological determinism adding another contentious issue of reification. Studies across eastern and western nations have shown that certain cultural values promote economic development and that the economy in turn changes cultural values. Urban historians were among the first to acknowledge the importance of technology in the city. It embeds the single most dominant characteristic of a city; its networked character perpetuated by information technology. Regardless of the deterministic stance (economic, cultural or technological), in the context of globalization, there is a mandate to mold the city to complement the global economic structure and urbanomics gains ascendancy.\n\nThe notion of urban’ is derived from ‘urbs’ which refers to the built city and ‘civitas’ which refers to feelings, rituals and convictions that define urban life. It connotes a dialectic relationship between materialism and ideas. This can be related to the ‘sense of place’ that Bourdieu refers to as ‘habitus’. He makes reference to symbolic capital – an appropriation of how things should be; that can be individualistic or collectively expressed. This concept has been well received in urban theory.\n\nArchitects focus on symbolism, engineers on quality standards, urban planners on land use and zoning and landscape artists on aesthetics, environmentalists on depletion of natural resources and climatic consequences, social-cause groups on the economically marginalized and residents on saving suburbs from degradation of neighborhood character. Symbolism has many facets but its cumulative capital does not provide a convincing wealth generation (economic capital) model as an alternative to prosper the city.\n\nIn fact, urbanomics can spillover beyond the city parameters. The process of globalization extends its territories into global city regions. Essentially, they are territorial platforms (metropolitan extensions from key cities, chain of cities linked within a state territory or across inter-state boundaries and arguably; networked cities and/or regions cutting across national boundaries) interconnected in the globalized economy. Some see global city-regions rather than global cities as the nodes of a global network.\n\nThe rules of engagement are built on economic sustainability – the ability to continuously generate wealth. The cornerstones of this economic framework are the following ‘4C’ attributes: (1) currency flow for trading, (2) commoditization of products and services in supply chain management, (3) command centre function in orchestrating interdependency and monitoring executions and (4) consumerization. Unless, decoupling the economy from these attributes can be demonstrated; symbolic capital expressions as legitimate as they may be; must accept the domineering status of urbanomics.\n\nArguably, the culprit of this economic entrapment is the high consumption lifestyle synonymous with affluence. The resolve may well be that ‘less is more’ and that true welfare lies not in rise in production and income. As such, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increasingly being questioned as inaccurate and inadequate. GDP includes things that do not contribute to sustainable growth and excludes non-monetary benefits that improve the welfare of the people. In response, alternative measures have been proposed such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) and the Index of Sustainable Welfare - ISEW.\n\n\n\n"}
