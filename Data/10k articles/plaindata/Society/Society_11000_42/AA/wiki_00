{"id": "2363701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2363701", "title": "Cradleboard", "text": "Cradleboard\n\nCradleboards (, , ) are traditional protective baby-carriers used by many indigenous cultures in North America and throughout northern Scandinavia amongst the Sámi. There are a variety of styles of cradleboard, reflecting the diverse artisan practises of indigenous cultures. Some indigenous communities in North America still use cradleboards.\n\nCradleboards are used for the first few months of an infant's life, when a portable carrier for the baby is a necessity. Some cradleboards are woven, as with the Apache. Woven cradleboards are made of willow, dogwood, tule, or cattail fibres. Wooden cradleboards are made by the Iroquois and Penobscot. Navajo cradleboards are made with a Ponderosa pine frame with buckskin laces looped through the frame.\n\nWhatever materials are used to make cradleboards, they share certain structural elements. Cradleboards are built with a broad, firm protective frame for the infant's spine. A footrest is incorporated into the bottom of the cradleboard, as well as a rounded cover over the infant's head that arcs out from the cradleboard, similar to a canopy or a modern-day baby carriage hood. The purpose of this headpiece is to provide shade for the infant, since it could be covered with an animal skin, or a blanket in winter to protect against the elements in colder climates. The headpiece also provides extra head protection in case anything bumps against the cradleboard. Ornaments and sacred amulets are often attached to the headpiece as well, for example \"beaded umbilical cord cases, and dream catchers or medicine wheels\", to amuse and help the infant develop his or her eyesight.\n\nThe inside of the cradleboard is padded with a lining of fresh plant fibres, such as sphagnum moss, cattail down, or shredded bark from juniper or cliffrose. The lining serves as a disposable diaper, although the Navajo could clean and reuse the lining made of shredded juniper or cliffrose bark. These plant fibres have antiseptic properties, and thus nurture healthy skin in the infant. The Chippewa tradition was to make a lining for the cradleboard usually from moss growing in cranberry marshes, which is smoked over a fire to kill insects, then rubbed and pulled to soften it. In cold weather, the infant's feet may be wrapped in rabbit skin with the fur facing inward. The moss lining is surrounded by a birch bark tray insert placed into the cradleboard, which could be removed for cleaning.\n\nCradleboards have been used in cultures ranging from the sub-Arctic regions of present-day Canada, down to Mexico and Central America. In Arctic regions, cold weather does not make a cradleboard feasible for the infant's survival, and infants are carried by being placed in a sling worn under the mother's parka. Cradleboards were widely used by indigenous people across present-day North America. Cradleboards are used by the Kickapoo people in Mexico and were used by Aztecs and the Seri people and Mayan communities as far south as Belize. In present-day South America, most indigenous cultures used slings or pouches, sometimes called a \"rebozo\", for carrying infants rather than cradleboards. Cradleboards were used in the southernmost part of the continent, however, in the Patagonia region.\n\nCradleboards were used during periods when the infant's mother had to travel or otherwise be mobile for work, and needed to protect the infant. The cradleboard could be carried on the mother's back, using support from \"tumplines\", or \"burden straps\" that would wrap around her forehead, chest or shoulders; if she carried a pack as well as the cradleboard, the pack strap would go around her chest and the cradleboard strap would go around her forehead. The cradleboard can also be stood up against a large tree or rock if the infant is small, or hung from a pole (as inside an Iroquois longhouse), or even hung from a sturdy tree branch. They were also used when longer travel was required, as the cradleboard could be attached to a horse for transportation.\n\nIn the southwest United States and northern Mexico, among cultures such as the Hopi and Apache, infants would spend most of their day and night in the cradleboard, being taken out of it for progressively longer periods, for up to five times per day. When the infant reaches the age when it can sit up unsupported, it is then gradually weaned from the use of the cradleboard, and spends progressively less time in it. At this time, the infant may use a second, larger cradleboard that replaces the first. By the time the infant is a year old and begins to walk, they are generally finished with cradleboard use.\n\nCradleboard use and its effect on mother-infant interaction has been studied in Navajo communities. It has been shown that cradleboard use has no significant negative effect on this development. In the first few months of infancy, cradleboards have a soothing effect on babies. After 6 months of age or more, infants begin to resist being placed in cradleboards more vigorously as they become more mobile, and they are often placed in the cradleboard with their arms and hands free, so that they can play with objects hung from the cradleboard for their amusement.\n\nCradleboard use has been associated with increased incidence of developmental dysplasia of the hip. The technique requires straightening the legs, which encourages dislocation of the femur and malformation of the acetabulum.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31265421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31265421", "title": "Digital privacy", "text": "Digital privacy\n\nDigital Privacy is a collective definition that encompasses three sub-related categories; information privacy, communication privacy, and individual privacy. The term is often used in contexts that promote advocacy on behalf of individual and consumer privacy rights in digital spheres, and is typically used in opposition to the business practices of many e-marketers/businesses/companies to collect and use such information and data. \n\n\"Main article: Information Privacy\"\n\nIn the context of digital privacy, information privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to determine how their digital information, mainly that pertaining to personally identifiable information, is collected and used. The EU has various laws that dictate how information may be collected and used by companies. Some of those laws are written to give agency to the preferences of individuals/consumers in how their data is used. In other places, like in the United States, privacy law is argued by some to be less developed in this regard. By example, some legislation, or lack of, allows companies to self-regulate their collection and dissemination practices of consumer information. \n\nIn the context of digital privacy, communication privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to communicate information digitally with the expectation that their communications are secure; meaning that messages and communications will only be accessible to the sender's original intended recipient. However, communications can be intercepted or delivered to other recipients without the sender's knowledge, in a multitude of ways. Communications can be intercepted directly through various hacking methods. Communications can also be delivered to recipients unbeknownst to the sender because of false assumptions made regarding the platform or medium which was used to send information. An example of this is failure to read a company's privacy policy regarding communications on their platform could lead one to assume their communication is protected when it is in fact not. Additionally, companies frequently have been known to lack transparency in how they use information, this can be both intentional and unintentional. Discussion of communication privacy necessarily requires consideration of technological methods of protecting information/communication in digital mediums, the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of such methods/systems, and the development/advancement of new and current technologies.\n\nIn the context of digital privacy, individual privacy is the notion that individuals have a right to exist freely on the internet, in that they can choose what types of information they are exposed to, and more importantly that unwanted information should not interrupt them. An example of a digital breach of individual privacy would be an internet user receiving unwanted ads and emails/spam, or a computer virus that forces the user to take actions they otherwise wouldn't. In such cases the individual, during that moment, doesn't exist digitally without interruption from unwanted information; thus their individual privacy has been infringed upon. \n\nThe following examples are systems that allow a user to remain anonymous when accessing the web, and by extension the use of which better ensures the protection of their personally identifiable information. \n\nOnion Routing was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab and was intended to anonymize web traffic. The system created a path to any TCP/IP server by creating a pathway of onion routers. Once a pathway has been established, all information that is sent through it is anonymously delivered. When the user has finished utilizing the pathway it was essentially deleted which freed the resources to be used for a new pathway within Onion Routing. The Onion Routing project developed into what is today known as TOR, a completely open-sourced and free software. Unlike its predecessor, Onion Routing, Tor is able to protect both the anonymity of individuals as well as web providers.This allows people to set up anonymous web servers which in effect provides a censorship-resistant publishing service. \n\nThe previously mentioned information anonymity systems can also potentially protect the contents of communications between two people, but there are other systems that directly function to guarantee a communication remains between only two people; they function to accomplish that only the intended recipient of a communication will receive it.\n\nOne of these systems, PGP (which is an acronym for \"Pretty Good Privacy\"), has existed in various forms for many years. It functions to protect email messages by encrypting and decrypting them. It originally existed as a command-line-only program, but in recent years it has evolved to have its own full interface and a multitude of email providers offer built-in PGP support. Users can also install PGP-compatible software and manually configure it to encrypt emails on nearly any platform. \n\nSSL (acronym for Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (acronym for Transport Layer Security) are measures to secure payments online. While these systems are not immune from breaches or failure, many users benefit greatly from their use as every major browser program has support for it built in. \n\n\"Main article: Phishing\"\n\nPhishing is a common method of obtaining someone's private information. This generally consists of an individual (often referred in this context as a hacker), developing a website that looks similar to other major websites that a target person commonly uses. The target person can be directed to the site through a link in a 'fake' email that is designed to look like it came from the website he/she commonly uses. The user then clicks on the URL, proceeds to sign in, or provide other personal information, and as opposed to the information being submitted to the website that the user thought they were on, it is actually sent directly to the hacker. \n\nDigital privacy is a trending social concern. For example, the TED talk by Eric Berlow and Sean Gourley subsequent to the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures cast a shadow over the privacy of cloud storage and social media. While digital privacy is concerned with the privacy of digital information in general, in many contexts it specifically refers to information concerning personal identity shared over public networks. \n\nBefore the Edward Snowden disclosures concerning the extent of the NSA PRISM program were revealed in 2013, the public debate on digital privacy mainly centered on privacy concerns with social networking services, as viewed from within these services.\n\nAs the secrecy of the American Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act becomes widely disclosed, digital privacy is increasingly recognized as an issue in the context of mass surveillance.\n\nThe use of cryptographic software to evade prosecution and harassment while sending and receiving information over computer networks is associated with crypto-anarchism, a movement intending to protect individuals from mass surveillance by the government.\n\n"}
{"id": "9808403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9808403", "title": "Fishbowl (conversation)", "text": "Fishbowl (conversation)\n\nA fishbowl conversation is a form of dialog that can be used when discussing topics within large groups. Fishbowl conversations are sometimes also used in participatory events such as unconferences. The advantage of fishbowl is that it allows the entire group to participate in a conversation. Several people can join the discussion.\n\nFour to five chairs are arranged in an inner circle. This is the fishbowl. The remaining chairs are arranged in concentric circles outside the fishbowl. A few participants are selected to fill the fishbowl, while the rest of the group sit on the chairs outside the fishbowl. In an open fishbowl, one chair is left empty. In a closed fishbowl, all chairs are filled. The moderator introduces the topic and the participants start discussing the topic. The audience outside the fishbowl listen in on the discussion.\n\nIn an open fishbowl, any member of the audience can, at any time, occupy the empty chair and join the fishbowl. When this happens, an existing member of the fishbowl must voluntarily leave the fishbowl and free a chair. The discussion continues with participants frequently entering and leaving the fishbowl. Depending on how large your audience is you can have many audience members spend some time in the fishbowl and take part in the discussion. When time runs out, the fishbowl is closed and the moderator summarizes the discussion.\n\nAn immediate variation of this is to have only two chairs in the central group. When someone in the audience wants to join the two-way conversation, they come forward and tap the shoulder of the person they want to replace, at some point when they are not talking. The tapped speaker must then return to the outer circles, being replaced by the new speaker, who carries on the conversation in their place.\n\nIn a closed fishbowl, the initial participants speak for some time. When time runs out, they leave the fishbowl and a new group from the audience enters the fishbowl. This continues until many audience members have spent some time in the fishbowl. Once the final group has concluded, the moderator closes the fishbowl and summarizes the discussion.\n\nAn advantage of a fishbowl conversation is that it is suitable for large groups. It also lessens distinctions between the speakers and the audience. This has made fishbowls popular in participatory group meetings and conferences.\n\nThis is not a forum where introverted or shy people will be inclined to contribute. To include them, it is possible to break the dialog down into much smaller groups to make them feel comfortable to discuss a topic. Their opinions can be garnered upfront through a post-it gathering exercise or with live-voting on whose opinion they value/want replaced (via non-technical show of arms/clapping or a digital live-voting app).\n\nThe group can be split into two smaller and distinct subgroups (such as men and women, or older and younger participants), who convene separately and come up with three to four questions for the other group, which are written on cards. The participants reconvene and exchange cards, and form two circles, one subgroup inside the other, both of them facing inwards. The inside group read a question and discuss it, while those in the outside circle listen but do not speak. Each question is discussed in this way, making sure everyone in the inner circle has a chance to speak. The circles are then reversed. The questions that the groups generate can be on the same subject or not, at the discretion of the organizer. This version is a good party game for groups of thirty to sixty people.\n\nAnother derivative is to have the fishbowl run for a certain period of time - e.g., half an hour. The moderator stops the discussion in the fishbowl circle and invites those not in the inner circle to offer their thoughts and comments on what they are hearing in the inner circle.\n\nAnother variation is to use technology, such as CoverItLive, to increase participation. This allows all the participants in the Outer Circle the opportunity to share their thinking in the public online forum without needing to wait turns. The online forum is also projected in the room for the Inner Circle to use as additional talking points or building ideas from. This variation allows for an environment that supports extroverts and introverts. ( Extroverts - speaking in front of the group, Introverts - sharing their thinking in the online public forum ). In this variation, a hot seat ( or open seat ) is also available for Outer Circle participants so they can at any time join the Fishbowl (Inner Circle) and share their thinking verbally if needed.\n\n"}

{"id": "58855557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58855557", "title": "Geography of disability", "text": "Geography of disability\n\nGeography of disability is a branch of Human Geography focusing on the disabled or impairs and their experience. Disability refers to individuals with physical and intellectual impairments. (Jacobson, 2013) The difference between the disability and impairment is that disability is the restriction of the ability caused by the actual decrement of functioning, aka impairment, of the individual. The Geography of disability studies the experience of disabled people and examines the relationship between the disability and space, ranging from the accessibility, mobility and the landscape, in terms of socio-economic, environmental and political perspectives. Hawkesworth, a scholar refers the Geography of disability as “a set of discursive and performative practice”, which intersects more with in the social and cultural aspects, instead of solely on the physical impairment.\n\nAccording to the World report on disability published by the World Health Organisation, around 15% of the world population, which is approximately 1.14billion people, lives with a disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant disability. In Europe and America, the disability ratio is one in five people.\n\nThere are some major factors that give rise to the risk of non-congenital disability, which are age, their living environment, their gender and the access to healthcare. The report had shown that there is a strong correlation between age and the risk of disability, the elder tends to have a higher risk of disability such as Alzheimer, cognitive impairment. There is a global correlation between the disability and poverty due to the short of resources and government investment to medical service, and lack of access to healthcare. Inadequate infrastructure and investment could worsen the condition. In Australia, a research on disability conducted by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra had demonstrated a strong correlation that the more economically disadvantaged area or community people living in, the higher probability of these people will suffer from disability problem or severe disability, justified by the social gradient of disability correlation coefficient. The likelihood of having severe disability of the population who live in the disadvantaged area in Sydney were 2.6% higher than the population who live in the most economically and socially advantaged area in Sydney This correlation could also be seen in the United State. In the US, according to the 2017 Disability Statistics Annual Report conducted by Institute on Disability/UCED of University of New Hampshire, the distribution of people with disabilities aged from 18-64 has concentrated in the Southeast United States, including Georgia Tennesse, Louisiana and Arkansas etc, which are also the most economically disadvantaged area among the state. For examples, in Memphis, Tennesse, a city with 26.2% poverty rate is also one of the cities with the densest disabled population, 12.6%-17.8% of its working population (aged from 18-64) live with disabilities. The figures also indicated that female is riskier of being disability than male regardless of their age. In Europe, according to the Eurostat, women are 3% more prone to suffering from a longstanding health problem, daily activity difficulties or both than men in Europe in 2011.\n\nGeography scholars had been recognizing the issues of disability since the 1930s. The study has then been extended to a range of socio-spatial processes relating to the issue arisen from disability, that interacts among power, space, and society. There were some analyses of disability within the socio-spatial perspectives, though these analyses tended to isolate from each other instead of integrating all ideas together as a critical discourse. It also changed the definition of disability from a medical point of view towards the socio-spatial determinants.\n\nImrie, explained the recent development in \"The Geographies of Disability\" as follows:\n\n“An opening observation is that what has emerged, since the mid 1990’s, has been a broadening of the substantive focus of studies of space and disability, beyond some of the earlier foci of health, cognition and behaviour, welfare, design, and architecture. In particular, the study of disability is evident in most parts of human geography, and not just confined to a specialist or sub-part of the discipline.\n\nHowever, up to the early 1990’s, the study of geography and disability had been the preserve of specific niche areas of research activity, with some scholars, like Park et al (1998), suggesting that human geography had rarely engaged with studies of 7 disability.’’\n\nThe narratives and discursive practices, suggested by Hawkesworth, is also emerged in the geography of disability studies. It has developed to the interrelationships between the body, the feeling of a place and disability, suggested by Imrie, which lead to a wider and deeper scope and the focus of the studies especially regarding to different age groups with different extent and types of disability, for examples, children with learning difficulties vs elderly people.\n\nThe disabled are often seen as the oppressive socialization of a given form of physiological difference, experiencing who suffer the common socially.\n\nThe medical model of refers Disability as the physical problem, the incapability of a disabled person to perform as ‘normal’ as a person that has no disability. Disability intrigues a further disclosure on easing the inconvenience and improving a disabled’s daily experience. For example, introducing advanced assistive devices or aids like mobile wheelchair for disabled individuals who live on their own. On the other hand,  the social model of disability evokes the idea of social integration through demonstrating the difficulties faced by the disabled in the wake of their physical or mental functioning decrement. The social model of disability encourages the mainstream social and cultural structure to accommodate the disabled individuals with more assistive infrastructure and social attitude.\n\nIn the Geography of disability, the research mainly focuses on discussing the relationships between the disabled, their basic human rights and the social development, as in the inclusion and the marginalization. This was one of the main study to research and approach the disabled’s need, address the problem without additional negative effects or embarrassment to the disabled pupils. Many of the disabilities do not have equal access to the resources aka the materiality or the basic human rights aka the non-materiality inequality as ‘the normal’ population, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. . Their weak and limited physical ability led to higher and extreme level of difficulty to make earning and accumulate wealth by their own power as a non-disabled. This, as a result, make it more difficult for them to live out of poverty or economic disadvantage. What’s more, discrimination, inequality and social exclusion reflected from the ‘mainstream’ society and thus received by the disabled population in different areas creates a virus circle of the disabled experience. Children and teenagers who has learning difficulties is more likely to cause them a discrimination, getting rejected by the mainstream school. The young disabled population aged 15–24 are 10 times more prone to receiving discrimination than the elder disabled population aged 65 and over. And it seems to them doomed to be/ inevitably be socially marginalized and excluded.\n\nImrie(2007) further described in his article of how the geographical research methodology is carried out and work well for the social research on disabled people.\n\n“Hall and Kearns (2001: 243), for example, comment that ‘traditional’ research methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, ‘can fail to represent the geographical lives of intellectually disabled people’ (also, see Hall, 2004). Similarly, a project by Kitchin (2000), about the opinions of disabled people about social research, shows that most do not like the use of methods that fail to capture the complexities of disability. Such methods include pre-set questions that collect quantitative data and statistics. These observations suggest that the use of particular qualitative or interpretative methods are a preferred way of giving voice to disabled people’s experiences, and open up scope for inclusive research practices. In this respect, there have been some important methodological developments in geographical research that seek to articulate the different ways that disabled people know and experience the world.“\n\nA disabled person’s origin and living environment, including the mobility, accessibility, space, living condition, greatly determine and impact his daily experience, and even affect his physical and mental condition. Space, resources, and investment to be invested in the infrastructure needed by the disabled population are somehow considered to be ‘extra’, as the mainstream society has neglected, somehow judged and less inclined to put forward about it. One of the aim to be achieved through the geography studies of disability is to highlight the issue and problem the disabled population come across on daily basis so as to create a more including and less-tension society and community.\n\nThe concept of the Accessible tourism is one of the significant developments derived from the development of the geography of disability. The idea behind the accessible tourism is to strive for a basic human right for the disabled to participate in tourism, and to promote the best accessibility practices in tourism by engaging representatives of international tourism sector as well as the representatives of disabled individuals and also non-governmental parties to cooperate. In the wake of the development of disability researches, along with the awareness of the need of tourists, the concept and the idea of accessible tourism which aim to promote ‘tourism without barriers’ has gradually drawn people’s attention as well as the World Tourism Organisation’s publication. UNWTO has since published a range of information including Manuals on Accessible Tourism for tourism stakeholders to ensure the quality and quantity of the supply of good accessible tourism practises, and recommendations on Accessible Tourism for people with disabilities.\n\nThe research results of the geography of disability intrigue a further studies of universe design of space in relation to the mobility and accessibility, and the improvement of the assistive technologies to confront the barriers encountered by the disabled. The geographical model of disability was created during research of the geography of disability. According to Zajadacz, he stated that: “In recent years, geographers have made significant strides towards understanding the spatially of disability. This research has presented disability as a characteristic of the population that inevitably leads to marginalization and spatial exclusion from otherwise normal social arenas and spaces within the built environment. Geographers claimed that throughout the research on the geography of disability, they connected the cause of disability in terms of social and spatial environment and helped the promotion of more accommodating resolution which “provide access to sites and the full scope of life within society taking different degrees and types of disability into consideration.”\n\nGaining the idea of disability from the social model of disability and the geographical model of disability, the definition and the attitude towards Disability no longer limited only to the physical decrement of an individual, but evolve further to the consideration to disabled’s daily experience relating to social and spatial aspects.\n\nIn WHO’s report about the disabling barriers, it said:\n\n“Beliefs and prejudices constitute barriers to education, employment, health care, and social participation.

The song is an unofficial anthem of the Basques, besides the Eusko Abendaren Ereserkia, a largely instrumental version used for official purposes in the Basque Autonomous Community. In 2007, as set out by the 4/2007 Chartered Decision, the General Assembly of Biscay declared it the district's official anthem.\n\nThe popularity of the song quickly expanded (sung by the bard in Madrid venues) on the heat of the pro-fueros movement in the run-up to their definite suppression (1876) and the political unrest following it. Its echo quickly spread to the French Basque Country, where it took hold spurred by the \"Lore Jokoak\" festivals, the \"Floral Games\".\n\nThe song was chosen for the solemn end to the demonstration held at Pamplona in 1893, and sang along by the crowds, after widespread indignation sparked at the Spanish government's breach of fiscal terms concerning Navarre—protests known as the \"Gamazada\".\n\nThe local newspaper \"La Voz de Fitero\" (southern fringes of Navarre) reported on the cheerful official reception in honour of the district MP Ramon Lasanta held on 30 April 1913, where an enthusiast audience sang the Gernikako Arbola along, and demanded an encore from the music band.\n\nThe anthem was often rendered in performances by Pablo de Sarasate and Julian Gayarre. It has been called the \"Marseillaise of the Basques\". The tree has also inspired a passage of \"La prudencia en la mujer\" by the Spanish playwright Tirso de Molina and a sonnet of William Wordsworth.\n\nThere are versions with four, eight or twelve stanzas.\nAlso, Iparragirre as a bertsolari would introduce changes during his performances.\n"}

In 1966 about 70% of dwellings were owner-occupied – one of the largest proportions of any country. The remainder were rented dwellings. About half of the owner-occupied dwellings were under mortgage.\n\nAustralian governments have encouraged broad-scale home ownership through tax incentives, although mortgage interest is not tax deductible as, for example, in the United States. The owner-occupied residential home is not subject to the capital gains tax on sale and is not counted in the assets test for Centrelink pension purposes. It is also not taxed for land tax or other property tax.\n\nIn the past, home ownership has been a sort of equalising factor; in postwar Australia, immigrant Australians could often buy homes as quickly as native-born Australians. Additionally, Australian suburbs have been more socio-economically mixed than those in America and to a lesser extent Britain. In Melbourne, for instance, one early observer noted that \"a poor house stands side by side with a good house.\"\n\nThere are significant regional differences in rates of homeownership around Australia, reflecting average age differences (e.g., older age people tend to own houses more than younger people), as well as socio-economic differences.\n\nIn the 2009–10 Survey of Income and Housing, it was found that an estimated 33% of households owned their homes outright (i.e. without a mortgage) and 36% were owners with a mortgage. A further 24% were renting from a private landlord and 4% were renting from a state or territory housing authority.\n\nBetween June 1996 and June 2010, the proportion of households without a mortgage declined from 43% to 33%, while the proportion with a mortgage rose from 28% to 36%. Since 1995–96, the proportion of households renting from state/territory housing authorities has declined slightly while the proportion renting privately increased from 19% to 24% in 2009–10. While a greater proportion of all renting households are renting from private landlords, there is an increased number of private renters receiving Commonwealth rent assistance.\n\nHome ownership in Australia decreased to 67% in 2011, the lowest level in over 50 years. Tasmania has the highest home-ownership rate at 70%, and the Northern Territory the lowest at 46%.\n\nOn the 2016 Census Home ownership in Australia decreased Even Further to 65% in 2016.\n\nThe 24% of dwellings which are rented by private landlords may be considered income-producing or investment properties, and the private landlords as investors, though some owner-occupiers may also view their dwellings as investments. The main difference is that the rent paid by a tenant is income of the landlord-investor, while an owner-occupier does not generally derive any income from the property. Similarly, the investor can claim expenses relating to the property, including property taxes, interest and depreciation, which the owner-occupier cannot. The rent paid by a tenant for private or domestic purposes is not generally an allowable deduction of the tenant, as are any expenses relating to the property.\n\nThe owner-occupied dwelling is not subject to the capital gains tax on sale, while the investment property is, though entitled to a CGT discount of 50%.\n\nHome ownership in Australia is becoming more exclusive. The ratio of the price of the average home to Australians' average income was at an all-time high in the late 1990s. Young people are buying homes at the lowest rates ever, and changes in work patterns are reducing many households' ability to retain their homes.\n\nAt the same time, homes that are being constructed are increasing in size and holding fewer people on average than in the past. The proportion of houses with four or more bedrooms has increased from 15% in 1971 to greater than 30% in 2001.\n\nA number of economists, such as Macquarie Bank analyst Rory Robertson, assert that high immigration and the propensity of new arrivals to cluster in the capital cities is exacerbating the nation's housing affordability problem. According to Robertson, Federal Government policies that fuel demand for housing, such as the currently high levels of immigration, as well as capital gains tax discounts and subsidies to boost fertility, have had a greater impact on housing affordability than land release on urban fringes.\n\nThe Productivity Commission Inquiry Report No. 28 First Home Ownership (2004) also stated, in relation to housing, \"that Growth in immigration since the mid-1990s has been an important contributor to underlying demand, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.\" This has been exacerbated by Australian lenders relaxing credit guidelines for temporary residents, allowing them to buy a home with a 10 percent deposit.\n\nThe RBA in its submission to the same PC Report also stated \"rapid growth in overseas visitors such as students may have boosted demand for rental housing\". However, in question in the report was the statistical coverage of resident population. The \"ABS population growth figures omit certain household formation groups – namely, overseas students and business migrants who do not continuously stay for 12 months in Australia.\" This statistical omission lead to the admission: \"The Commission recognises that the ABS resident population estimates have limitations when used for assessing housing demand. Given the significant influx of foreigners coming to work or study in Australia in recent years, it seems highly likely that short-stay visitor movements may have added to the demand for housing. However, the Commissions are unaware of any research that quantifies the effects.\" \n\nSome individuals and interest groups have also argued that immigration causes overburdened infrastructure.\n\nIn December 2008, the federal government introduced legislation relaxing rules for foreign buyers of Australian property. According to FIRB (Foreign Investment Review Board) data released in August 2009, foreign investment in Australian real estate had increased by more than 30% year to date. One agent said that \"overseas investors buy them to land bank, not to rent them out. The houses just sit vacant because they are after capital growth.\"\n\nTo cope with the high demand of housing, the desirability in renting, and most significantly an influx of immigration, major Australian cities have seen a boom in high-rise apartment construction. According to ABC News and UBS, the number of cranes on Australian high-rise sites levelled out at a peak of 548, having surged 323% since late-2013.\n\nIn June 2011, The CEO of ANZ Bank, one of the big 4 banks in Australia and New Zealand said housing should not be a vehicle for speculative price growth, but simply as shelter. He also criticised the Federal Government's policy on negative gearing tax breaks which increases the focus on housing as an investment rather than shelter and decrease affordability.\n\n\n"}

It was not a written language until 1995, when linguist Bert Vaux designed an orthographic system for it based on the Turkish alphabet; the Armenian alphabet was used by Christian immigrants from Hamshen (Northern Hamshenis)—who refer to the language as Homshetsma (Հոմշեցմա) in Russia and Abkhazia.\n\nHomshetsi is a spoken language amongst the Eastern Hemshinli, also known as the Hopa Hemshinli, who live in a small number of villages in Turkey's Artvin Province and Central Asia. The Western or Rize Hamsheni are a related, geographically separate group living in Rize Province, who spoke Homshetsi until sometime in the 19th century. They now speak only Turkish with many Homshetsi loanwords. A third group, the northern Homshentsik, who live in Russia, Georgia (Abkhazia), Armenia, also speak Homshetsi.\n\nHomshetsi has linguistic features that indicate it belongs to the Western Armenian dialect group; however, the two are generally not mutually intelligible. Homshetsi has close ties to the Armenian dialects formerly found in northeastern Turkey, in particular in Khodorchur and, to a lesser extent, in Trabzon. Because of its extended isolation, Homshetsi contains many archaisms that set it apart from all other Armenian dialects. The language preserves forms found only in Classical and Middle Armenian, and at the same time preserves foreign (especially Arab and Turkish) grammatical and lexical components that were stripped from modern Armenian during the twentieth century. \"Homshetsma therefore gives us one of our only glimpses of Armenian in its 'pure' form\", writes Bert Vaux.\n\nUNESCO has categorised Homshetsi as a language that is \"definitely endangered\".\n\n"}

{"id": "10799345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10799345", "title": "Jebala people", "text": "Jebala people\n\nThe Jebala (), is a group of -Berber nomadic mountain people, which inhabit North-West Morocco. The Jebala people inhabit the plains from the city of Targuist to the west, in contrast with the Berber Rifian people inhabiting the plains from Targuist to the east. The North-West of Morocco include cities such as Tangier, Tetouan, Chefchaouen, and Larache.\n\nThe word \"Jbala\" comes from Arabic (\"Jbel\") which means \"mountain\". Thus Jbala means \"mountain people\". A man or boy is called a \"Jebli\" while a woman or a girl is called a \"Jebliya\".\n\nThe Jebala speak an Arabic Hassani-dialect influenced by Berbers and Andalucians of Northern Morocco and Al-Andalus and the fact that their land lies on the route between these places. The Jebala people should not be confused with the Berbers inhabiting the Rif mountains. They are different from them based on history, ethnicity and linguistically. \n\nThe inhabitants of the North are divided in two broad traditional ethnolinguistic categories, the Arabic-speaking jebala in the west which trace their maleline to dynasties and tribes such as the Idrisid dynasty and the Maqil tribe. In the East you have the Tarifit-speaking Riffians, with the dividing line and watershed in Targuist. Before the arrival of the Arabian Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym tribes in the 12th century, the Jebala country was the only rural region where non-bedouinic Arabic was spoken, and it still remains the only significant rural region where a non-bedouin Arabic dialect is spoken. Most of the Jebala people are centered in North-West Morocco and the Southern Rif Mountains (Fez-Meknes district), compared to the Berbers which are most centered in the Central and Eastern regions of the Riff Mountains. Next to the Arabian Jebala people, the area is also inhabited by Sephardi Jews and native Jews. Since they were not accepted in the other regions in the mountains, these classes were only found in the Arab tribal lands of the plains to the North-West of the Mountains. Some Jewish people today still live in cities like Tangier and Chefchaouen.\n\nVery little is known about the prehistory of the region, but the history of the Jebala people seems to be well documented since early Islamic times. The early Islamic history of the Rif, through the Arabian Salihid dynasty of the Nakur, whose members were from the Yemenite tribe Himyar, and which lasted from pre-Idrisid until Almoravid times with the fall of the Madinat Al-Nakur (710-1108 CE). This part of the history seems to be well documented, but when the Berber Almoravid started ruling, the history of the Rif is almost total blank. The usual tradition is that almost every existing social group in the Rif mountains, whether Arabian or Berber in origin, originated from somewhere else, not too far away from the country.\n\nThe Jebala speak a \"pre-hilalian\" Arabic dialect called Jebli Arabic, which is influenced by the Spanish language due to proximity to Spain which also controlled areas of the region during the protectorate era (1912-1956) and has a Berber substratum.\n\nThe traditional clothing for women includes shawls called \"mendils\" made from cotton or wool. These rectangular shawls are often woven in stripes of white and red in the region. They are wrapped around the waist to form skirts. They are also used as shawls and securing holding babies or goods on the back or front of the body.\n\nThe traditional man's outer garment is the djellaba, a one piece cotton or woolen cloak with a pointed hood. In the Jebela region the wool is usually un-dyed so dark brown and off-white colours are common. White djellabas are worn for religious festivals.\n\nThe Jelaba favour pointed toed leather slippers. Natural light brown, yellow and white are the most common colours. Reed hats are another traditional feature of Jebala dress for both men and women. Women's hats are often adorned with woven woollen tassels and roping of black, white and red in variations.\n\nThe Jebala people have a different culture compared to the Riff Berberians. The Jebala people use oxen yoked by their horns for ploughing, opposed to the riffian use of cows yoked by their neck. For the roofing of their houses, the Jebala people use roofs made of corrugated iron and thatch, when the Riff Berberians use dried clay. The Jebala inhabited areas amongst the Atlantic coast, tanger and western Riff have more rainfall, thus using peaking roofs compared to the flat roofs used in the Riff with less rainfall. The Jebala have real villages with houses clustered together, while the Riffians traditionalle have dispersed homesteads each located at least 300 metres from the next.\n\nMusic and dancing are also very different. The Jebala play the \"Ghayta\" (a form of clarinet), and the tbul (drum), and dancing is generally performed by boys. The Riff musicians, who belong to a socially and occupational inferior class calling themselves \"Imdhyazen\", generally come from one tribe, the \"Ait Touzin\". They play the \"Addjun\" (tambourine) and the \"zammar\" (a kind of clarinet) with unmarried girls and old women dancing.\n\n\n"}

Each of these islands has its own slang. \n\nThe phonology is similar to the Mainland dialect of Malayalam, but with certain notable differences.\n\nThe initial short vowels, especially 'u', may fall away. For example: rangi (Mal. urangi) - slept, lakka (Mal. ulakka) - pestle.\n\nAs for the consonants, the following differences are notable:\n\n1. Initial ch in Mainland Malayalam, becomes sh: sholli (Mal.(old) cholli) - said.\n2. Initial p in Mainland Malayalam, becomes f: fenn (Mal. pennu) - girl.\n3. Initial v in Mainland Malayalam, becomes b: bili (Mal. vili) - call.\n4.

Future: the suffix added is 'um'. So, kaanum - will see.\nThe negatives of these tenses show some differences:\n\n1. For present tense, the negative is formed by adding vela (ppela for some verbs)to the stem. Not only that, a present negative may also function as a future negative. So, kaanuvela - is not seeing, does not see, will not see.\n2. For past tense, the negative is formed by suffixing ela to the past stem. So, kandela - did not see, has not seen. \n3. For the future tense, the old Malayalam poetic suffix 'aa' may be used (kaanaa).\nThe interrogative forms are made by suffixing 'aa' with some changes effected.\nSo, kaanundyaa (does/do ... see?) for kaanunda (sees), kandyaa (did ... see?) for kanda (saw), and kaanumaa/kaanunaa/kaanungaa (will ... see?) for kaanum (will see).\n"}

He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1817. He intended to be a ship's surgeon, and was on his way to the West Indies when he was wrecked on the Lancashire coast. While at Liverpool he was encouraged to take up his residence at Warrington. He became a Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1822, and on 9 October 1823 married Mary (1794/5–1851), daughter of David Bellhouse. The couple subsequently moved to Manchester. He soon had an extensive general practice, and, on his appointment in 1827 to the post of surgeon to the Manchester Lying-in Hospital, turned his special attention to midwifery and to the physiology and diseases of women and children. He was also a lecturer at the Marsden Street School of Medicine. His first publication was \"Observations on the Mortality and Physical Management of Children\" (1827). From 1830 onwards he wrote a series of scientific papers for the \"Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal\" on the time of onset of female puberty in various countries, which led James Cowles Prichard to alter some of the conclusions which he had arrived at in the earlier editions of his \"Physical History of Mankind\". These, along with other similar papers, are reprinted in Roberton's most important work, \"Essays and Notes on the Physiology and Diseases of Women and on Practical Midwifery\" (London, 1851). He devoted much time to the subject of hospital construction and the provision of convalescent homes, on which he wrote a number of pamphlets between 1831 and 1861.\n\nRoberton's advice was largely sought in the discipline in which he had specialised, obstetrics, and he was aware of the broader social and medical context of his work. He helped much to extend the fame of the Manchester school of obstetrics founded by Charles White and continued by John Hull and Thomas Radford.\n\nHe was an active social reformer, interesting himself in all local and national movements for improving the condition of working people and active in the Manchester Statistical Society. In religion he was a puritan and nonconformist, and the intimate friend of the popular preachers Robert Stephen McAll and Robert Halley.\n\nHe died at his residence at New Mills, Derbyshire, where he had retired on relinquishing his practice. His wealth at death was under £40,000 (under £2.9 million at 2003 prices).\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was noted for her pin-up photos and roles in B-movies, as well as a prominent role in the famous opening \"tracking shot\" in Orson Welles' crime drama \"Touch of Evil\".\n\nLansing was born at Holy Cross Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah in 1929 to Jack Glen Brown (also known as Glen Jack Brown and Glenn Jack Brown; 1900–1960), a shoe salesman and orchestra musician, and Virginia Grace (née Shupe) Brown, a housewife (1908–1984).\n\nShe would later be known by her stepfathers' surnames, i.e. Wassmansdorff and Loveland. In 1940, her family moved to Los Angeles, where her half-brother, Larry Vernon Loveland, was born the same year. She began modeling in her teens, and at age 14 was signed to a contract at MGM. She completed high school on the studio lot.\n\nA model and actress, Lansing was often cast in roles similar to those played by her contemporaries Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren. She was frequently clad in skimpy costumes and bikinis that accentuated her figure (34D bust), but she never posed nude. Lansing practiced yoga for relaxation, and as a devout Mormon, she did not drink, smoke, or use drugs.\n\nLansing's film career began in 1948, and in 1952, she played an uncredited role in MGM's \"Singin' in the Rain\". She received top billing in \"Hot Cars\" (1956), a crime drama involving a stolen-car racket. In the opening sequence of Orson Welles's \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), she appeared as Zita, the dancer who dies at the end of the famous first tracking shot, during which her character exclaims to a border guard, \"I keep hearing this ticking noise inside my head!\"\n\nShe had a brief role as an astronaut's girlfriend in the 1958 sci-fi classic \"Queen of Outer Space\". She had fourth billing in another sci-fi story, 1959's \"The Atomic Submarine\". During the 1960s, she starred in short musical films for the Scopitone video-jukebox system. Her songs included \"The Web of Love\" and \"The Silencer\".\n\nIn 1964, producer Stanley Todd discussed a film project with Lansing, tentatively titled \"Project 22\", with location shooting planned in Yugoslavia, and George Hamilton and Geraldine Chaplin named to the cast. The movie was never made.\n\nLansing played \"Lola\" in the romantic comedy \"Marriage on the Rocks\" (1965) with a cast that included Frank Sinatra, Deborah Kerr, and Dean Martin. She previously had appeared in Sinatra's drama \"A Hole in the Head\" and in Martin's comedy \"Who Was That Lady?\". She turned down the chance to replace Jayne Mansfield in \"The Ice House\" (a horror film), and instead appeared opposite Basil Rathbone (in his last film appearance) and John Carradine in \"Hillbillys in a Haunted House\", as Mamie Van Doren's replacement. Her last film was \"Bigfoot\" (1970).\n\nLansing starting singing in nightclubs in the early 1960's, and her performances are documented in several trade magazines. She performed with the Xavier Cugat orchestra and briefly toured with Les Paul, but little is known about songs she actually recorded. Apparently, while starring on \"Love That Bob\", she recorded a 45 r.p.m. single on the small REO record label in 1957: \"Love Me/What's It Gonna Be\" (REO #1007). In 1962, she recorded 6-8 sides at Que Recorders in Los Angeles. These turned up at auction and were acetates of 4 songs each (with two songs duplicated on the second acetate). It is unknown whether these tracks were ever released on an album. Both acetates list the same identifying number of #4-8351. The songs recorded on 2/23/62 were \"Masquerade Is Over\", \"All of You\" (Cole Porter), \"The One I Love\" (which was most likely \"The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else)\", and \"\"Who Cares?\" (George and Ira Gershwin)\". On 4/30/62, the songs recorded were Feel So Young (which was probably You Make Me Feel So Young), Dream (1944 song), Masquerade, and All Of You. It was reported in Cashbox magazine on 4/17/65 that Lansing was recording an album for RCA records with Jimmie Haskell (and suggested that it should be titled \"Joi To The World Of Jazz\"), but nothing further is known about this project.\n\nLansing appeared in \"The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok\", \"The Jack Benny Program\", \"It's a Great Life\", \"I Love Lucy\", \"Where's Raymond?\", \"Noah's Ark\", \"State Trooper\", \"The People's Choice\", \"Richard Diamond, Private Detective\", \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\", \"Sugarfoot\", \"Bat Masterson\", \"This Man Dawson\", \"Maverick\", \"Petticoat Junction\", \"The Mothers-in-Law\", and \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\", and had a recurring role in \"The Beverly Hillbillies\".\n\nIn 1957, she played Vera Payson in the \"Perry Mason\" episode, \"The Case of the Crimson Kiss\". She is best known perhaps as Shirley Swanson in \"The Bob Cummings Show\" or \"Love That Bob\" (1956–59). She appeared in several episodes as a busty model who was the foil for photographer Bob Collins, Cummings' series name. The series ran for 173 episodes. She achieved some distinction for beating out Lois Lane (Noel Neill) to marry Superman (George Reeves) as the title character in \"Superman's Wife\", a 1958 episode of \"The Adventures of Superman\".\n\nWhat was possibly Lansing's best role may have been her least-seen as the leading lady in \"The Fountain of Youth\", a Peabody Award-winning unsold television pilot directed by Orson Welles for Desilu in 1956 and broadcast on the \"Colgate Theatre\" two years later. The half-hour film remains available for public viewing at the Paley Center for Media in New York City and Los Angeles.\n\nIn the 1960–61 season of \"Klondike\", Lansing appeared as Goldie with Ralph Taeger, James Coburn, and Mari Blanchard. In 1960, she appeared as Evelyn in the \"Election Bet\" episode of the \"Mr. Lucky\" TV series (season 1, episode 34). In May 1963, Lansing appeared in \"Falcon Frolics '63\". The broadcast honored the men stationed at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. By 1956, she had appeared in more than 200 television shows. The real count according to IMDb is around 104 appearances.\n\nShe appeared in five episodes of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" in the role of Gladys Flatt, the unlikely glamorous wife of bluegrass musician Lester Flatt. She named Ozzie Nelson as possessing the greatest sex appeal of any actor with whom she worked. The two played a love scene in a \"Fireside Theater\" drama.\n\nLansing has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, for her contributions to television.\n\nLansing died from breast cancer on August 7, 1972, at St. John's Hospital, Santa Monica, California. She had been treated surgically for the disease two years earlier. She also suffered from severe anemia. She was survived by her mother, half-brother, and paternal grandmother. While some press accounts gave her age as 37, she was actually 43 years old.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4295687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4295687", "title": "Kabyle people", "text": "Kabyle people\n\nThe Kabyle people (Kabyle: \"Iqbayliyen\", ) are a Berber ethnic group indigenous to Kabylia in the north of Algeria, spread across the Atlas Mountains, one hundred miles east of Algiers.\nThey represent the largest Berber-speaking population of Algeria and the second largest in the continent of Africa.\n\nMany of the Kabyle have emigrated from Algeria, influenced by factors such as the earlier French conquest of the area, deportation, and latterly industrial decline and unemployment. Their diaspora has resulted in Kabyle people living in numerous countries. Large populations of Kabyle people settled in France and, to a lesser extent, Canada.\n\nThe Kabylians speak the Kabyle Berber language. Since the Berber Spring of 1980, they have been at the forefront of the fight for the official recognition of Berber languages in Algeria.\n\nThe Kabyle were relatively independent of outside control during the period of Ottoman Empire rule in North Africa. They lived primarily in three different kingdoms: the Kingdom of Kuku, the Kingdom of Ait Abbas, and the principality of Aït Jubar. The area was gradually taken over by the French during their colonization beginning in 1857, despite vigorous resistance. Such leaders as Lalla Fatma n Soumer continued the resistance as late as Mokrani's rebellion in 1871.\n\nFrench officials confiscated much land from the more recalcitrant tribes and granted it to colonists, who became known as \"pieds-noirs.\" During this period, the French carried out many arrests and deported resisters, mainly to New Caledonia (see: \"Algerians of the Pacific\"). Due to French colonization, many Kabyle emigrated into other areas inside and outside Algeria. Over time, immigrant workers also went to France.\n\nIn the 1920s, Algerian immigrant workers in France organized the first party promoting independence. Messali Hadj, Imache Amar, Si Djilani, and Belkacem Radjef rapidly built a strong following throughout France and Algeria in the 1930s. They developed militants who became vital to the fighting for an independent Algeria. This became widespread after World War II.\n\nSince Algeria gained independence in 1962, tensions have arisen between Kabylie and the central government on several occasions. In 1963 the FFS party of Hocine Aït Ahmed contested the authority of the FLN, which has promoted itself as the only party in the nation.\n\nIn 1980, protesters mounted several months of demonstrations in Kabylie demanding the recognition of Berber as an official language; this period has been called the Berber Spring. In 1994–1995, the Kabyle conducted a school boycott, termed the \"strike of the school bag\". In June and July 1998, they protested, in events that turned violent, after the assassination of singer Matoub Lounes and passage of the law requiring use of Arabic in all fields.\n\nIn the months following April 2001 (called the Black Spring), major riots among the Kabyle took place followed the killing of Masinissa Guermah, a young Kabyle, by gendarmes. At the same time, organized activism produced the \"Arouch\", and neo-traditional local councils. The protests gradually decreased after the Kabyle won some concessions from President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.\n\nThe geography of the Kabyle region played an important role in the people's history. The difficult mountainous landscape of the Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia provinces served as a refuge, to which most of the Kabyle people retreated when under pressure or occupation. They were able to preserve their cultural heritage in such isolation from other cultural influences.\n\nThe area supported local dynasties (Numidia, Fatimids in the Kutama periods, Zirids, Hammadids, and Hafsids of Bejaïa) or Algerian modern nationalism, and the war of independence. The region was repeatedly occupied by various conquerors. Romans and Byzantines controlled the main road and valley during the period of antiquity and avoided the mountains (Mont ferratus). During the spread of Islam, Arabs controlled plains but not all the countryside (they were called \"el aadua\" : enemy by the Kabyle).\n\nThe Regency of Algiers, under Ottoman influence, tried to have indirect influence over the people (makhzen tribes of Amraoua, and marabout).\n\nThe French gradually and totally conquered the region and set up a direct administration. \n\nAlgerian provinces with significant Kabyle-speaking populations include Tizi Ouzou, Béjaïa and Bouira, where they are a majority, as well as Boumerdes, Setif, Bordj Bou Arreridj, and Jijel. Algiers also has a significant Kabyle population, where they make up more than half of the capital's population.\n\nThe Kabyle region is referred to as \"Al Qabayel\" (\"tribes\") by the Arabic-speaking population and as \"Kabylie\" in French. Its indigenous inhabitants call it \"Tamurt Idurar\" (\"Land of Mountains\") or \"Tamurt n Iqbayliyen\"/\"Tamurt n Iqbayliyen\" (\"Land of the Kabyle\"). It is part of the Atlas Mountains and is located at the edge of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Kabyle speak Kabyle, a Berber language of the Afro-Asiatic family. As second and third languages, many people speak Algerian Arabic, French and, to a lesser degree English.\n\nDuring the first centuries of their history, Kabyles used the Tifinagh writing system. Since the beginning of the 19th century, and under French influence, Kabyle intellectuals began to use the Latin script. It is the basis for the modern Berber Latin alphabet.\n\nAfter the independence of Algeria, some Kabyle activists tried to revive the old Tifinagh alphabet. This new version of Tifinagh has been called Neo-Tifinagh, but its use remains limited to logos. Kabyle literature has continued to be written in the Latin script.\n\nThe Kabyle people are mainly Muslim, with a small Christian minority. Since the 19th century, there has been a large nominal Sunni Muslim community. Among Kabyle Muslims, the main tradition is Maraboutism. Many Zaouia exist all over the region; the Rahmaniyya is the most prolific.\n\nCatholics of Kabyle background generally live in France and result from intermarriage with the French. Recently, the Protestant community has had significant growth, particularly among Evangelical denominations.\n\nThe traditional economy of the area is based on arboriculture (orchards and olive trees) and on the craft industry (tapestry or pottery). Mountain and hill farming is gradually giving way to local industry (textile and agro-alimentary). In the middle of the 20th century, with the influence and funding by the Kabyle diaspora, many industries were developed in this region. It has become the second most important industrial region in the country after Algiers.\n\nThe Kabyle have been fierce activists in promoting the cause of Berber (\"Amazigh\") identity. The movement has three groups: those Kabyle who identify as part of a larger Berber nation (Berberists); those who identify as part of the Algerian nation (known as \"Algerianists\", some view Algeria as an essentially Berber nation); and those who consider the Kabyle to be a distinct nation separate from (but akin to) other Berber peoples (known as Kabylists).\n\nFor historical and economic reasons, many Kabyles have emigrated to France, both for work and to escape political persecution. They now number around 1 million people. Some notable French people are of full or partial Kabyle descent.\n\n\n\n\n\nA study by Arredi, et al. (2004) includes the frequencies of lineages among one Kabyle population from Tizi Ouzou province.\n\n\n\n"}

Both male and female same-sex sexual activity are legal in Montenegro, but households headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for the same legal protections available to opposite-sex married couples.\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity is banned in employment, the provision of goods and services, education and health services. Montenegro also possesses hate crime and hate speech laws which include sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds of non-discrimination. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association has ranked Montenegro 23rd out of 49 European countries in terms of LGBT rights legislation. Despite this, Montenegrin society has yet to reach a high level of acceptance, and discrimination against LGBT people often goes unreported.\n\nMontenegro decriminalised same-sex sexual activity in 1977. The age of consent (14) was also equalised in 1977.\n\nThere is no legal recognition of same-sex couples. The Constitution of Montenegro bans same-sex marriage.\n\nOn 13 November 2012, then Deputy Prime Minister Duško Marković stated that the Montenegrin Government would prepare a bill giving some form of legal recognition to same-sex couples. As of 2018, the Human and Minority Rights Ministry has drafted a bill to legalise registered partnerships. Under the bill, same-sex couples would be able to register their relationship and receive some of the rights, benefits and responsibilities of marriage. This would not include adoption and fostering rights. The Serbian Orthodox Church and the Democratic Front have come out in opposition to the proposal, claiming it would \"wreck\" Christian values and family life in Montenegro.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, the Montenegrin Parliament passed a non-discrimination law that includes sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds of discrimination. This was one of the requirements the country had to meet for European Union membership.\n\nIn 2013, the Criminal Code was amended to prohibit hate speech on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity, and to provide penalty enhancements if a crime is committed based on the victim's LGBT status. These changes came into force on 3 June 2014.\n\nAdditionally, gays, lesbians and bisexuals are not banned from military service.\n\nTransgender people in Montenegro are allowed to change legal gender, but require undergoing sex reassignment surgery, sterilization, divorce if married and receiving a medical diagnosis to do so.\n\nGays and lesbians may face discrimination and harassment in Montenegro. Anti-gay attitudes are deeply ingrained in society and there is widespread opposition to LGBT rights.\n\nThe gay scene is very small. The first Gay Pride event in Montenegro was held on 24 July 2013 in the coastal town of Budva, organized by the NGO \"LGBT Forum Progress\", and it subsequnelty caused various reactions in public. On 20 October 2013, a Pride event took place in the capital city of Podgorica, where violent anti-gay protesters were arrested by police.\n\nIn September 2017, the fifth annual Podgorica Gay Pride parade took place without any recorded incident. It was organized by the NGO \"Queer Montenegro\", and was attended by about 200 people.\n\n"}

{"id": "51777272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51777272", "title": "Malcolm W. Klein", "text": "Malcolm W. Klein\n\nMalcolm Klein (born September 4, 1930) is a criminologist, researcher, theorist, retired professor of Sociology at the University of Southern California, and the author of his book \"The American Street Gang\". In addition, he continued to publish eighteen other books and more than fifty articles that are based on his research on gangs.\n\nThroughout the forty years of his research in gangs, he primarily focused on its structures, processes, and their intervention strategies. He was the founder of the Social Science Research Institute at the University of Southern California in 1972 and furthered his agenda in research of gangs. He also began developing gang prevention and intervention strategies, which are promoted by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (Department of Justice) and the Youth Development and Delinquency Prevention Administration (Department of Health Education and Welfare). But he took his research further than the city of Los Angeles. He introduced cross-national research, stretching all the way to Europe. He began this process his extension of comparative criminology by organizing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Advanced Research Workshop and later the first Eurogang Workshop in Schmitten, Germany.\n\nKlein is best known for his research and understanding of how gangs function and its prevention. In his research, he looked at gangs in another point of view that past theorists and researchers did not look at before. He created the connections between different variables of gangs, thus allowing other researchers to look further into the issue of delinquency of gangs. Furthermore, he contributed to comparative criminology by bringing his research into a global perspective. His contributions allowed him to be honored with the August Vollmer Award not only for his research, but also for his \"justice or to the treatment or prevention of criminal or delinquent behavior.\"\n\nKlein is a Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Southern California. He was born on September 4, 1930. He took part in the faculty at the Sociology Department of the University of Southern California from 1962 to 1998. From 1971 to 1984, he took the position as the Chair of the University of Southern California Sociology Department.\n\nKlein was most notable for his many years of research on gangs. He defines it as \"any durable, street-oriented youth group whose involvement in illegal activity is part of its group identity.\"\n\nOne of the main things that Klein emphasizes throughout his years of research is how our law enforcement strategies against street gangs are not working. In an audio interview on the show \"Which Way, L.A.?\", Klein and the host, Warren Olney, talk about two major gang-related arrests that occurred in 2007 (the arrest of Steve Garcia and the arrest of Mario Corona, who is a former gang member with a master's degree in social research from the University of Southern California). Furthermore, they debate the controversy of releasing a top ten most wanted gang member list. Throughout Klein's career, he emphasizes the problem with giving too much attention to gangs. He concluded that the major goal of a street gang is to obtain reputation all across their territory and recognition for their delinquencies. In the audio specifically, he disagreed with the approach of law enforcement to gang activity through arrests and release of a \"list\" because it would not slow down gang activity, but instead would help them instead.\n\nThroughout his years of research, he arrived at the conclusion that the more attention society provides to gangs, the more active and upward rising gang activity becomes. His evaluation on The Group Guidance Project can illustrate his point. The Group Guidance Project was a program that began back in the 1940s by the Los Angeles Probation Department with a goal of reuniting gang members to their community through different group activities such as weekly club meetings, sports activities, tutoring, individual counseling, and advocacy with community agencies and organizations. However, Klein claims that \"increased group programming leads to increased cohesiveness (in both gang growth and gang 'tightness'), and increased cohesiveness leads to increased gang crime.\" Klein believes that cohesion is one (if not the biggest) part of a street gang and with programs like these, it only serves to increase cohesion between gangs by giving them a more organized methods towards their activities.\n\nKlein's research also expanded to an international level, where he instituted \"comparative criminology.\" In \"comparative criminology,\" Klein examines many differences and similarities on how different cultures affect different gangs in different regions of the world, their behavioral regulations, structures and organizations of gangs, and also delinquencies and crimes of those areas. One big project that he embarked on for this global research on gangs was the Eurogang Project in 1998, where he went to Schmitten, Germany for a conference among American and European researchers to discuss the different aspects of criminology that pertain to their own regions.\n\nIn one of his gang control options, he demonstrates it in a table.\n\nOn the left hand side, there are prevention, intervention, and suppression. These are strategies for gang control policies. \"Prevention\" refers to stop people from being in a gang beforehand. \"Intervention\" refers to come in between the people who are already in gangs and attempting to disengage them from the group or reduce their association with the gang. \"Suppression\" refers to stopping the illicit activities of gangs. This concept usually points to law enforcement, arrests, police, courts, correction facilities, and many others. On the top are issues that are present in gang control policies and what it looks like in an ideal policy. \"Targeting\" is the correct identification of people who are in gangs, whether they are preparing to join or already joining. This principle heavily relies on a person's knowledge of what a gang really is, its structure, organization, activities, effects throughout the years, history, and much more. \"Group Process\" refers to the idea that \"gangs are groups.\" Klein believes that policy makers must remember that membership of gangs is solidified through opposition from enforcement and society. Once membership solidifies, it prompts others to join and bring the gang group closer. \"Gang Structures\" refers to the organizations of gangs and the knowledge of how each gang functions, what type of gang they fit into, and their characteristics. Finally, \"Community Context\" refers to the environment where the gangs take place. Klein emphasizes this concept because the community itself describes how gangs behave and their foundation of the gang. Not all these boxes would be filled, but the table can tie together different issues of dealing with street gangs and assess which aspects a policy needs to utilize to make an effective gang control policy and scheme.\n\nIn Klein's publication of \"The American Street Gang\", he provides us with the basic definition of street gangs, their evolution throughout the past years, their drug involvement, and reasons to why society has not stopped their actions yet. Klein describes these gangs as an organization of loose bodies tied with multiple and more casual leaderships as compared to our modern day society (with their tightly-knit organization and formal leaderships). Klein also makes a clear distinction between the common street gang and drug gangs. On one hand, a drug gang produces strict discipline on its members, who are treated as if they were employees of a company. On the other hand, a street gang is structured in terms of \"loyalty\" and \"similar rivalries,\" thus producing a less strict discipline on its members. Furthermore, Klein includes a variety of statistics, anecdotes, and personal experience to demonstrate that gang activity across America is on the rise, especially with gang homicides and the general spread of the gangs themselves. Another point that Klein explains is that the liberal method towards the solution of gang activity is not working and instead, is increasing \"group cohesion.\" He believes that the more attention that society gives to gangs, the closer the gang will be, and the greater gang activity will become. From his own personal experience, he tells readers that the programs that will gradually break down the \"group cohesion\" will take lots of effort to do so.\n\nKlein and Cheryl Maxson provides their insights (in a more philosophical approach) towards the \"troubled\" youth population. The three basic social and philosophical principles that they utilize to discuss the troubled youths are \"treatment, deterrence, and normalization rationales.\" Treatment is the adjustment of emotional problems that are present in the behaviors of status offenses of the troubled youth. Deterrence is the act of control and punishment towards status offenses to prevent further delinquencies. Normalization rationales is the recognition that status offenses are normal behaviors present in the youth population. They examine these three principles in status offenders at seven different cities and their activities in the cities' youth service agencies based on their data from surveys and experiments. Additionally, the authors analyze the legislative aspect of status offenses, particularly in state laws, policies, approaches, and ideologies that are implanted in the legislation that deals with status offenses. Towards the end of the book, Klein and Maxson head into youth runaways by describing the patterns in characteristics, family histories, living conditions, and causes of runaway youths and also different services that are available to runaway youths.\n\nMalcolm Klein and Cheryl Maxson examine the different patterns in characteristics of street gangs (specifically in America) and review many major gang-control programs seen around the world. In particular, he focuses on the distribution and expansion of gangs, patterns of gang crime, and how gangs are structured and organized. Going into a more individualized level, Klein and Maxson analyze risk factors and reasons why people want to join gangs (especially in the youth population) in five different realms: individual, family, peer, school, and neighborhood. He also brings in community influences to further understand how gang develops and functions inside those communities. Lastly, Klein and Maxson provide their insights on gang prevention and intervention programs in the United States. They claim that current existing gang control methods are not only ineffective, but also are confronting the wrong parts of a gang. To deal with this, they provide a list of guidelines and goals that gang prevention and intervention programs are recommended to follow in order to control gangs more successfully.\n\nKlein describes the experiences of a fictional police officer who specializes in gangs named Paco Domingo based on his own observations and research throughout his time in gang activity research. By using Paco Domingo as a character, the author explains the inner structures and organization of gangs and the dangerous effects of when police officers use violent and corrupt measures to deal with gangs. Additionally, Klein talks about one of the most important part of the journey of a gang cop, their training. Overall, this book highlights the main points that are useful for those interested in the spread of gangs in America, such as criminologists, lawyers, law enforcement, police officers, and much more.\n\n\nThe European Research Group, led by Klein himself, was a conference that took place in Schmitten, Germany in 1998.(2) During this three-day time period, he attempted to produce comparative gang criminology into a global context by starting with Europe. Klein brought many different questions to hand, such as whether or not gangs exist in Europe, what the patterns and methods of gangs are, and much more. From thereafter, many European and American researchers in the conference (with Klein being the lead author) edited and published the first volume of \"The Eurogang Paradox\" (2001), explaining the denials held by European criminology researchers that street gangs were nonexistent in Europe because of the big difference between the definition and patterns of an \"American\" gang versus a \"European\" gang in their prospective regions.\n\nThe Ladino Hills Project was a project designed by Klein in 1967 in Eastern Los Angeles to combat \"group interventions.\" He began by implementing interventions that based more on the individual rather than the gang as a group. During this time, he included job training, tutoring, recreation in established agencies, and individual therapy in his interventions. From his evaluation, he found that while the sizes of gangs were reduced, the overall rate of delinquency as a gang decreased as well. Specifically, while gang cohesiveness dropped by 40 percent, the number of gang member arrests reduced by 35%. From the project, he states, \"we had affected the [gang members] but not their community. The lesson is both obvious and important. Gangs are byproducts of their communities: They cannot long be controlled by attacks on symptoms alone; community structure and capacity must also be targeted.\"\n\n\nThis award is named after the first police chief in Berkeley, California, who played a role in creating a scientific approach to the vigilante and police field. Not only is the recipient tested for their quality of their research, but also their contribution to \"justice or to the treatment or prevention of criminal or delinquent behavior.\" Malcolm Klein was a member of the American Society of Criminology and they led the giving of the August Vollmer Award. So in 2008, Malcolm Klein became a recipient of this award for his research in gang activity and criminal delinquency based on street gangs.\n\n"}

Regardless, Lukashenko rejected the offer in early 2007.\n\nDuring ethnic riots in the northern Russian city of Kondopoga, in August–September 2006, the DPNI provided an up to the minute online coverage of the unfolding situation in response to what it saw as the media's politically correct silence about what was happening there. DPNI representatives arrived in the town shortly after riots had commenced, and were able to largely control the flow of news and events in the absence of any reaction from local authorities or police. The DPNI, led by their leader Aleksandr Belov (Potkin), organized an \"assembly\" and advocated the deportation of Chechen and other migrants within 24 hours. Belov was later indicted for disturbing the peace.\n\nOn 22 June, few DPNI members took part in inter-ethnic fighting in the center of Moscow, near the Kremlin, according to Moscow city authorities, resulting in 42 arrests. DPNI leader Belov defended the action as having been provoked by ethnic groups from the Caucasus region (Chechens, etc.) who were dancing and conducting themselves loudly when prayers were to be conducted at the Monument to the Heroes of Plevna. Estimates of participants in the fighting range from 50 to 200; other groups participating included the Slavic Union, the Russian Public National Union (RONS), and the \"St. George\" youth group (\"георгиевцы\").\n\nOn 26 June 2007, the DPNI announced the formation of armed \"People's Self-Defense\" groups to defend \"indigenous citizens\" against \"the aggressive actions of criminal migrants.\" The groups will be trained in hand-to-hand fighting and are required to obtain \"legal hunting weapons and handguns.\" In April 2005, the DPNI had announced creation of \"mobile fighting groups\", composed of cell networks of five persons each, whose members would have access to automobiles and legal weapons. The 2005 announcement cited a \"possible worsening of the internal political situation in the Russian Federation and the likelihood of mass disorders and aggressive actions by foreign states.\"\n\nThe Movement Against Illegal Immigration was banned by the Moscow City Court on April 18, 2011. According to prosecutors, DPNI leaders had repeatedly taken part in events aimed at igniting interethnic hatred. However, it did not enter into force across Russia because it was appealed. At the same time, the 18 February 2011 decree of Moscow Chief Prosecutor about the suspension of the activities of the organization is in force. In August 2011, the High Court of Russian Federation has issued a federal ban of the organization.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4255433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4255433", "title": "Nakorotubu District", "text": "Nakorotubu District\n\nNakorotubu is a district in Fiji's Ra Province. It is made up seven sub-districts or \"Tikina makawa\", namely,\nKavula, Nakorotubu, Navitilevu, Bure-i-wai, Bure-i-vanua, Mataso, and Nakuailava.\n\nThe first four are coastal districts with extensive inland undulating and rugged terrain, while the rest are all inland. Fishing, sugar cane, coconut, taro, tapioca and a range of local vegetables are the main trading merchandise.\n\nIn 1986, the 'Bose Vanua Cokovata Nakorotubu' held in Namarai village appointed as the traditional leader -the late Turaga na Gonesau, Ratu Dr Wilisoni Tuiketei Malani OBE, younger brother of the late Ratu Meli Salabogi (3) MBE, from the chiefly village of Nabukadra in the district of Kavula. Their father, Ratu Kuliniyasi Roko Malani (1) held the British colonial title of chief administrator of Kavula District - 'Buli Kavula' from 1911- 1932. \n\nAccording to Sayes, Sally Annes, Ratu Meli Salabogi (1) (their Great Grandfather) declared Nakorotubu as an independent state in 1860 to protest of Cakobau declaring himself as a self-styled Tui Viti during the Deed of Cession negotiation with Great Britain. \n\nThe cause of the protest must have been inspired from an ancestral feud and dislike which had trickled down from Raivalita, (Ratu Meli Salabogi's (1) Grandancestor) on a sex scandal by Niumataiwalu, high chief from the Vuanirewa clan in Lau with Raivalita's brother's wife (Nadurucoko 2's wife- Radini Levuka). This resulted in the birth of Banuve (Cakobau's grandfather). \n\nNadurucoko 2 later sent a \"tabua\" (whales tooth) to Ono i Lau as a price for Niumataiwalu's head which resulted in his death when he was murdered by a Ono i Lau chief (Fergus Clunie, Fiji Museum, Julia Brooke-White - 1986).\n\nAccording to historical records, both Raivalita and Nadurucoko 2 were sons of Nailatikau Nabuinivuaka (1) and grandsons of Nadurucoko 1, the ruler of Korolevu Fort near Dewala creek in the interior of Nakorotubu in the Ra province. Nailatikau (1) had murdered his brother Vurewa near the Dewala creek (refer to native reserve map marked as \"Laba\") and ran away to his half-brother, Nacamavuto (same mother in Senibuli) on the Ra coast of Kavula, who then gave him a \"tabua\" and advised him to spent time in exile in Bau with his relative, the Roko Tui Bau (Native Lands Commission (NLC), 'Tukutuku ni Yavusa Kubuna', Ratu Isoa Natuituba, 1918). \n\nWhile settling in Bau, the overall chief of Bau at that time - Roko Tui Bau observed Nailatikau (1) superior tactical confrontation in warfare (NLC Records 1918, 'Tukutuku ni Yavusa Kubuna' by Ratu Isoa Natuituba). Roko Tui Bau then bestowed him as the first Vunivalu (Warlord) of Kubuna, arranged for Adi Kulanawa from Verata as his wife and also named Nailatikau (1) eldest son as Raivalita or Raivolita.\n\nNailatikau's (1) loyal warriors that were guarding the top of Korolevu Fort (Delainakorolevu) along the Dewala creek (leading into the Wainibuka river) in the interior of Nakorotubu followed him to Bau (referred to as \"Yavusa Delai\"). He later banished them to Levuka, Lakeba in Lau for eating a fish harvest without any prior traditional presentation to him. Nailatikau (1) named one of the two hills on Bau island as Uluinaceva in memory of the Yavusa Ratu hill fort near Nabukadra village and Delainakoro in short for Delainakorolevu in the interior of Nakorotubu along the Dewala creek. The two hills were partly leveled during the construction of the Vunivalu tomb in 1982.\n\nA few years after Nailatikau (1) had passed on, Niumataiwalu (Vuanirewa) led a delegation of the Yavusa Delai from Levuka, Lakeba in Lau to Bau to seek forgiveness to his younger son, Nadurucoko 2 (who was away in Vuna, Taveuni at that time) on the unauthorized eating of the fish harvest that was meant for his late father. During the merry making/celebration after the forgiveness function (\"matanigasau/ soro\"), the adultery affair was committed by Nadurucoko 2's wife and Niumataiwalu that resulted in the birth of Banuve who begat Tanoa and who begat Cakobau. This was also how the Vunivalu's wife- title became known as \"Radini Levuka\" or the Queen of Levuka. \n\nBased on this earlier ancestral scandal, Ratu Meli Salabogi (1) together with other Nakorotubu and Viwa chiefs raised their concerns about Cakobau (being Niumataiwalu's descendant and not of the original Vunivalu) self-declaring himself as Tui Viti (Smythe Report to Queen Victoria). As a follow up from this protest, Ratu Meli Salabogi (1) declared Nakorotubu as an independent state from Fiji in 1860. (Haynes. S.A 1984). The deed of cession to Great Britain was put on hold for another fourteen (14) years until 1874 when Ratu Meli Salabogi had passed on.\n\nTo maintain traditional stability during post 'deed of cession' era, one of the descendants of Raivalita, eldest child of the 1st Vunivalu Nailatikau Nabuinivuaka will reside for one night at the Vatanitawake Chiefly house in Bau, guarded by Nakorotubu traditional warriors, i.e. 1959 installation (Ratu Kuliniyasi Roko Malani (2)) and the aborted June 8th 2018 installation (Ratu Meli Salabogi Malani (4)). A tabua (whales tooth) of request will be presented the next morning by Tunitoga (Chief Representative of the Vunivalu) to Raivalita's descendant at Vatanitawake requesting him to lead the delegation across to Mataiwelagi to handover the authority of 'Vunivalu kei Kubuna' through a ritual handover speech, hand shake and 'yabo' i.e. breath-in kiss on the cheek. He will then lead the Vunivalu-elect only to the entrance of the installation shed before he retreats to Vatanitawake and will not be part of the second installation. The second installation for the Tui Kaba title, is performed by Roko Tui Bau, Tunitoga and the Tui Kaba clan. \n\nThere is another NLC ex-file version (private interview of Rt Meli Salabogi-NLC records, 1918) that explains the Vatanitawake handover. This is by virtue of Dewala/Dauwala's wife having an affair with Vueti at Suva (near Bureiwai) upon his return from his victory over the twins in Nakauvadra en route to Moturiki and then later Bau. This resulted in the birth of Nadurucoko, Raivalita's grandfather. Hence when his son, Nailatikau Buinvuaka was chased by the Dewala warriors, he was advised and given a tabua by his half brother (Nacamavuto from Kavula) to flee to Bau and introduce himself to his great-grandfather (Vueti) the first original Roko Tui Bau. He was then installed as his Vunivalu. Therefore the handover ceremony is undertaken by a descendant from Nakorotubu with two (2) hats of authority, i.e original Vunivalu and Roko Tui Bau. \n\nOther chiefly lineages within Nakorotubu district differs according to their respective heritage.\n\nIn the centre of Nabukadra is the grave of Ratu Mara Kapaiwai, a high chief of Bau Island, who was killed as a result of intra-family rivalries involving his cousin, the then ruler of the kingdom of Bau, Ratu Seru Cakobau in the early 19th century (Deryck Scarr, 1980). \n\nThe grave remains a prominent landmark in the centre of the village (Deryck Scarr, 1980), a showcase of victory over Bau. The Nakorotubu warriors snatched the body from Bau and had a proper burial in Nabukadra before Kapaiwai's heart could be eaten by Cakobau. This action prevented Kapaiwai's descendants (such as the late Fiji's statesman and first Fiji Legislative Council Speaker- Ratu Sir Vanayaliyali Sukuna) to be relegated as insignificant in status (bokola).\n\nOther recorded significant victories by the Nakorotubu warriors include the Puakaloa or Vuakaloa campaign conquer of the old chiefly Kedekede fort of the Vuanirewa clan in Lakeba, Lau (Reid, A.C 1980) and the conquer of the whole of Vanua Levu (Cakaudrove, Bua and Macuata) in the ' Torotorosila campaign' (Sayes, S.A 1984), (see also Reid, A.C 1990).\n\nNakorotubu is also well known for its richness in culture and tradition. Some of Fiji's best traditional dances or meke such as 'raude' now turned into a song by the famous Black Rose band which originates from Nakorotubu. The Fiji Military Forces has adopted a number of these mekes as its own, as well as a number for leading public schools in Fiji such as Queen Victoria School and Ratu Kadavulevu School.\n\nPublic infrastructure is not as well developed compared to other districts in Fiji which does not help with people living their daily lives, but there is an impressive degree of resilience and unity among the local people which is a hallmark of the people of Ra Province that enables them to create the best out of their beautiful natural environment.\n\nThe picturesque inland districts are joined to other provinces by the Kings Road, one of the country's main roads, which is struggling to receive sufficient fund to complete the tar-sealing work for the last remaining kilometers.\n\nDevelopment projects are generally carried out on a communal basis with finances coming from government, donors and the people themselves. Examples of projects are village pipe water system, power generation, village toilets and septic tanks, village meeting halls, nursing and health stations, schools and pre-school facilities etc.\n\nMany landowning units are interested in developing their land commercially and whilst there are many options, growing organic produces for export will fetch a healthy return. Given the scarcity of capital, many people will be keen to discuss with prospective investors how they together can develop the land commercially on a joint venture and mutually beneficial basis.\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wLcwWZ0TOs\n"}

{"id": "1088262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1088262", "title": "Organizational behavior", "text": "Organizational behavior\n\nOrganizational behavior (OB) or organisational behaviour is \"the study of human behavior in organizational settings, the interface between human behavior and the organization, and the organization itself\". OB research can be categorized in at least three ways, including the study of:\n\n\nChester Barnard recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their organizational role than when acting separately from the organization. Organizational behavior researchers study the behavior of individuals primarily in their organizational roles. One of the main goals of organizational behavior is \"to revitalize organizational theory and develop a better conceptualization of organizational life\".\n\nMiner (2006) mentioned that \"there is a certain arbitrariness\" in identifying a \"point at which organizational behavior became established as a distinct discipline\" (p. 56), suggesting that it could have emerged in the 1940s or 1950s. He also underlined the fact that the industrial psychology division of the American Psychological Association did not add \"organizational\" to its name until 1970, \"long after organizational behavior had clearly come into existence\" (p. 56), noting that a similar situation arose in sociology. Although there are similarities and differences between the two disciplines, there is still confusion around differentiating organizational behavior and organizational psychology.\n\nAs a multi-disciplinary , organizational behavior has been influenced by developments in a number of related disciplines including: Sociology, industrial/organizational psychology, and economics.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution is a period from the 1760s where new technologies resulted in the adoption of new manufacturing techniques and increased mechanization. In his famous iron cage metaphor, Max Weber raised concerns over the reduction in religious and vocational work experiences. Weber claimed that the Industrial Revolution's focus on efficiency constrained the worker to a kind of \"prison\" and \"stripped a worker of their individuality\". The significant social and cultural changes caused by the Industrial Revolution also gave rise to new forms of organization. Weber analyzed one of these organizations and came to the conclusion that bureaucracy was \"an organization that rested on rational-legal principles and maximized technical efficiency.\"\n\nA number of OB practitioners documented their ideas about management and organisation. The best known theories today originate from Henri Fayol, Chester Barnard, and Mary Parker Follet. All three of them drew from their experience to develop a model of effective organizational management, and each of their theories independently shared a focus on human behavior and motivation. One of the first management consultants, Frederick Taylor, was a 19th-century engineer who applied an approach known as the scientific management. Taylor advocated for maximizing task efficiency through the scientific method. The scientific method was further refined by Lillian and Frank Gilbreth, who utilized time and motion study to further improve worker efficiency. In the early 20th century the idea of Fordism emerged. Named after automobile mogul Henry Ford, the method relied on the standardization of production through the use of assembly lines. This allowed unskilled workers to produce complex products efficiently. Sorenson later clarified that Fordism developed independently of Taylor. Fordism can be explained as the application of bureaucratic and scientific management principles to whole manufacturing process. The success of the scientific method and Fordism resulted in the widespread adoption of these methods.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Hawthorne Works Western Electric factory commissioned the first of what was to become known as the Hawthorne Studies. These studies initially adhered to the traditional scientific method, but also investigated whether workers would be more productive with higher or lower lighting levels. The results showed that regardless of lighting levels, when workers were being studied, productivity increased, but when the studies ended, worker productivity would return to normal. In following experiments, Elton Mayo concluded that job performance and the so-called Hawthorne Effect was strongly correlated to social relationships and job content. Following the Hawthorne Studies motivation became a focal point in the OB community. A range of theories emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and include theories from notable OB researchers such as: Frederick Herzberg, Abraham Maslow, David McClelland, Victor Vroom, and Douglas McGregor. These theories underline employee motivation, work performance, and job satisfaction.\n\nHerbert Simon's \"Administrative Behavior\" introduced a number of important OB concepts, most notably decision-making. Simon, along with Chester Barnard, argued that people make decisions differently inside an organization when compared to their decisions outside of an organization. While classical economic theories assume that people are rational decision-makers, Simon argued a contrary point. He argued that cognition is limited because of bounded rationality For example, decision-makers often employ satisficing, the process of utilizing the first marginally acceptable solution rather than the most optimal solution. Simon was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on organizational decision-making. In the 1960s and 1970s, the field started to become more quantitative and resource dependent. This gave rise to contingency theory, institutional theory, and organizational ecology. Starting in the 1980s, cultural explanations of organizations and organizational change became areas of study, in concert with fields such as anthropology, psychology and sociology.\n\nResearch in and the teaching of OB primarily takes place in university management departments in colleges of business. Sometimes OB topics are taught in industrial and organizational psychology graduate programs.\nThere have been additional developments in OB research and practice. Anthropology has become increasingly influential, and led to the idea that one can understand firms as communities, by introducing concepts such as organizational culture, organizational rituals, and symbolic acts. Leadership studies have also become part of OB. OB researchers have shown increased interest in ethics and its importance in an organization. Some OB researchers have become interested in the aesthetic sphere of organizations.\n\nA variety of methods are used in organizational behavior, many of which are found in other social sciences.\n\nStatistical methods used in OB research commonly include correlation, analysis of variance, meta-analysis, multilevel modeling, multiple regression, structural equation modeling, and time series analysis\n\nComputer simulation is a prominent method in organizational behavior. While there are many uses for computer simulation, most OB researchers have used computer simulation to understand how organizations or firms operate. More recently, however, researchers have also started to apply computer simulation to understand individual behavior at a micro-level, focusing on individual and interpersonal cognition and behavior such as the thought processes and behaviors that make up teamwork.\n\nQualitative research consists of a number of methods of inquiry that generally do not involve the quantification of variables. Qualitative methods can range from the content analysis of interviews or written material to written narratives of observations. Common methods include ethnography, case studies, historical methods, and interviews.\n\nConsultants use principles developed in OB research to assess clients' organizational problems and provide high quality services.\n\nCounterproductive work behavior is employee behavior that harms or intends to harm an organization.\n\nMany OB researchers embrace the rational planning model. Decision-making research often focuses on how decisions are ordinarily made (normative decision-making), how thinkers arrive at a particular judgement (descriptive decision-making), and how to improve this decision-making (prescriptive decision-making).\n\nThere are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations including: Abusive supervision, bullying, incivility, and sexual harassment.\n\nAbusive supervision is the extent to which a supervisor engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates.\n\nAlthough definitions of workplace bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual. In order for a behavior to be termed bullying, the individual or individuals doing the harm have to possesses (either singly or jointly) more power than the victim.\n\nWorkplace incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and rude behavior and is characterized by an ambiguous intent to harm, and the violation of social norms governing appropriate workplace behavior.\n\nSexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, often creating an offensive workplace that interferes with job performance.\n\nOrganizational behavior deals with employee attitudes and feelings, including job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and emotional labor. Job satisfaction reflects the feelings an employee has about his or her job or facets of the job, such as pay or supervision. Organizational commitment represents the extent to which employees feel attached to their organization. Emotional labor concerns the requirement that an employee display certain emotions, such smiling at customers, even when the employee does not feel the emotion he or she is required to display.\n\nThere have been a number of theories that concern leadership. Early theories focused on characteristics of leaders, while later theories focused on leader behavior, and conditions under which leaders can be effective. Among these approaches are contingency theory, the consideration and initiating structure model, leader-member exchange or LMX theory, path-goal theory, and transformational leadership theory.\n\nContingency theory indicates that good leadership depends on characteristics of the leader and the situation. The Ohio State Leadership Studies identified dimensions of leadership known as consideration (showing concern and respect for subordinates) and initiating structure (assigning tasks and setting performance goals). LMX theory focuses on exchange relationships between individual supervisor-subordinate pairs. Path-goal theory is a contingency theory linking appropriate leader style to organizational conditions and subordinate personality. Transformational leadership theory concerns the behaviors leaders engage in that inspire high levels of motivation and performance in followers. The idea of charismatic leadership is part of transformational leadership theory.\n\nIn the late 1960s Henry Mintzberg, a graduate student at MIT, carefully studied the activities of five executives. On the basis of his observations, Mintzberg arrived at three categories that subsume managerial roles: interpersonal roles, decisional roles, and informational roles.\n\nBaron and Greenberg (2008) wrote that motivation involves \"the set of processes that arouse, direct, and maintain human behavior toward attaining some goal.\" There are several different theories of motivation relevant to OB, including equity theory, expectancy theory, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, incentive theory, organizational justice theory, Herzberg's two-factor theory, and Theory X and Theory Y.\n\nNational culture is thought to affect the behavior of individuals in organizations. This idea is exemplified by Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Hofstede surveyed a large number of cultures and identified six dimensions of national cultures that influence the behavior of individuals in organizations. These dimensions include power distance, individualism vs. collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity vs. femininity, long-term orientation vs. short term orientation, and indulgence vs. restraint.\n\nOrganizational citizenship behavior is behavior that goes beyond assigned tasks and contributes to the well-being of organizations.\n\nOrganizational culture reflects the values and behaviors that are commonly observed in an organization. Investigators who pursue this line of research assume that organizations can be characterized by cultural dimensions such as beliefs, values, rituals, symbols, and so forth. Researchers have developed models for understanding an organization's culture or developed typologies of organizational culture. Edgar Schein developed a model for understanding organizational culture. He identified three levels of organizational culture: (a) artifacts and behaviors, (b) espoused values, and (c) shared basic assumptions. Specific cultures have been related to organizational performance and effectiveness.\n\nPersonality concerns consistent patterns of behavior, cognition, and emotion in individuals. The study of personality in organizations has generally focused on the relation of specific traits to employee performance. There has been a particular focus on the Big Five personality traits, which refers to five overarching personality traits.\n\nThere are number of ways to characterize occupational stress. One way of characterizing it is to term it an imbalance between job demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help manage the demands.\n\nChester Barnard recognized that individuals behave differently when acting in their work role than when acting in roles outside their work role. Work-family conflict occurs when the demands of family and work roles are incompatible, and the demands of at least one role interfere with the discharge of the demands of the other.\n\nOrganization theory is concerned with explaining the workings of an organization as a whole or of many organizations. The focus of organizational theory is to understand the structure and processes of organizations and how organizations interact with each other and the larger society.\n\nMax Weber argued that bureaucracy involved the application of rational-legal authority to the organization of work, making bureaucracy the most technically efficient form of organization. Weber enumerated a number of principles of bureaucratic organization including: a formal organizational hierarchy, management by rules, organization by functional specialty, selecting people based on their skills and technical qualifications, an \"up-focused\" (to organization's board or shareholders) or \"in-focused\" (to the organization itself) mission, and a purposefully impersonal environment (e.g., applying the same rules and structures to all members of the organization). These rules reflect Weberian \"ideal types,\" and how they are enacted in organizations varies according to local conditions. Charles Perrow extended Weber's work, arguing that all organizations can be understood in terms of bureaucracy and that organizational failures are more often a result of insufficient application of bureaucratic principles.\n\nAt least three theories are relevant here, theory of the firm, transaction cost economics, and agency theory.\n\nTheories pertaining to organizational structures and dynamics include complexity theory, French and Raven's five bases of power, hybrid organization theory, informal organizational theory, resource dependence theory, and Mintzberg's organigraph.\n\nThe systems framework is also fundamental to organizational theory. Organizations are complex, goal-oriented entities. Alexander Bogdanov, an early thinker in the field, developed his tectology, a theory widely considered a precursor of Bertalanffy's general systems theory. One of the aims of general systems theory was to model human organizations. Kurt Lewin, a social psychologist, was influential in developing a systems perspective with regard to organizations. He coined the term \"systems of ideology,\" partly based on his frustration with behaviorist psychology, which he believed to be an obstacle to sustainable work in psychology. Niklas Luhmann, a sociologist, developed a sociological systems theory.\n\nOrganizational ecology models apply concepts from evolutionary theory to the study of populations of organisations, focusing on birth (founding), growth and change, and death (firm mortality). In this view, organizations are 'selected' based on their fit with their operating environment.\n\nScientific management refers to an approach to management based on principles of engineering. It focuses on incentives and other practices empirically shown to improve productivity.\n\n\n"}

It was initiated by Robin Elisabeth Cornwell, and is endorsed by Richard Dawkins, a prominent atheist. The campaign aims to create more openness about being an atheist by providing a means by which atheists can identify themselves to others by displaying the movement's scarlet letter \"A\", a scarlet colored capital \"A\" in the Zapfino typeface, and an allusion to the scarlet letter \"A\" worn by Hester Prynne after being convicted of adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\". It encourages those who wish to be part of the campaign to come out and re-appropriate, in a humorous way, the social stigma that in some places persists against atheism, by branding themselves with a scarlet letter.\nCornwell has stated that the gay rights movement was a source of inspiration for the campaign.\nThe campaign, however, encourages one to \"out\" only oneself; it invites atheists to:\nThe campaign produces discreet attire that is centered on the scarlet \"A\", and the term \"OUT\" which is usually typographically isolated from the rest of the containing phrase. There is no overt mention of atheism other than the use of the symbols. The \"A\" is one of the most popular symbols for atheism in current usage. Nonetheless, American Christian organizations have begun to respond: the campaign has even been called \"a wake-up call\" for Christians.\n\nThe campaign produced T-shirts, hoodies, bumper stickers, stickers, and lapel pins sold through Richard Dawkins's online store, with the proceeds going to the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.\n\nIn 2014, reflecting an approach similar to the \"coming out\" strategy of the gay rights movement, a group called Openly Secular was formed to encourage nonreligious and non-theistic Americans to be open about their personal secularity. The group states its mission \"is to eliminate discrimination and increase acceptance by getting secular people – including atheists, freethinkers, agnostics, humanists and nonreligious people – to be open about their beliefs.\" In one video produced for the group, comedian and television personality Bill Maher urges atheists to be open about their religious skepticism, dismissing the Bible as a book \"based on ancient myths.\"\n\n\n"}

In order to do this, microeconomic theory is utilized to assess whether the private market is likely to provide efficient outcomes in the absence of governmental interference. Inherently, this study involves the analysis of government taxation and expenditures. This subject encompasses a host of topics including market failures, externalities, and the creation and implementation of government policy. Public economics builds on the theory of welfare economics and is ultimately used as a tool to improve social welfare.\n\nBroad methods and topics include:\n\nEmphasis is on analytical and scientific methods and normative-ethical analysis, as distinguished from ideology. Examples of topics covered are tax incidence, optimal taxation, and the theory of public goods.\n\nThe Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) classification codes are one way categorizing the range of economics subjects. There, Public Economics, one of 19 primary classifications, has 8 categories. They are listed below with JEL-code links to corresponding available article-preview links of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online (2008) and with similar footnote links for each respective \"sub\"category if available:\n\nIn 1971, Peter A. Diamond and James A. Mirrlees published a seminal paper which showed that even when lump-sum taxation is not available, production efficiency is still desirable. This finding is known as the Diamond–Mirrlees efficiency theorem, and it is widely credited with having modernized Ramsey's analysis by considering the problem of income distribution with the problem of raising revenue. Joseph E. Stiglitz and Partha Dasgupta (1971) have criticized this theorem as not being robust on the grounds that production efficiency will not necessarily be desirable if certain tax instruments cannot be used.\n\nOne of the achievements for which the great English economist A.C. Pigou is known, was his work on the divergences between marginal private costs and marginal social costs (externalities). In his book, \"The Economics of Welfare\" (1932), Pigou describes how these divergences come about:\n\n...one person A, in the course of rendering some service, for which payment is made, to a second person B, incidentally also renders services or disservices to other persons (not producers of like services), of such a sort that payment cannot be extracted from the benefited parties or compensation enforced on behalf of the injured parties (Pigou p. 183).\n\nIn particular, Pigou is known for his advocacy of what are known as corrective taxes, or Pigouvian taxes:\n\nIt is plain that divergences between private and social net product of the kinds we have so far been considering cannot, like divergences due to tenancy laws, be mitigated by a modification of the contractual relation between any two contracting parties, because the divergence arises out of a service or disservice to persons other than the contracting parties. It is, however, possible for the State, if it so chooses, to remove the divergence in any field by \"extraordinary encouragements\" or \"extraordinary restraints\" upon investments in that field. The most obvious forms which these encouragements and restraints may assume are, of course, those of bounties and taxes (Pigou p. 192).Externalities arise when consumption by individuals or production by firms affect the utility or production function of other individuals or firms. Positive externalities are education, public health and others while examples of negative externalities are air pollution, noise pollution, non-vaccination and more. The government can intervene in the market, using an emission tax for example to create a more efficient outcome; this Pigouvian tax is the optimal policy prescription for any aggregate, negative externality. \n\nPigou describes as positive externalities, examples such as resources invested in private parks that improve the surrounding air, and scientific research from which discoveries of high practical utility often grow. Alternatively, he describes negative externalities, such as the factory that destroys a great part of the amenities of neighboring sites.\n\nIn 1960, the economist Ronald H. Coase proposed an alternative scheme whereby negative externalities are dealt with through the appropriate assignment of property rights. This result is known as the Coase theorem.\n\nPublic goods, or collective consumption goods, exhibit two properties; non-rivalry and non-excludability. Something is non-rivaled if one person's consumption of it does not deprive another person, (to a point) a firework display is non-rivaled - since one person watching a firework display does not prevent another person from doing so. Something is non-excludable if its use cannot be limited to a certain group of people. Again, since one cannot prevent people from viewing a firework display it is non-excludable. Conceptually, another example of public good is the service that is provided by law enforcement organizations, such as sheriffs and police. Typically, cities and towns are served by only one police department, and the police department serves all of the people within its jurisdiction.\n\nWhile the origins of cost–benefit analysis can be traced back to Jules Dupuit's classic article \"On the Measurement of the Utility of Public Works\" (1844), much of the subsequent scholarly development occurred in the United States and arose from the challenges of water-resource development. In 1950, the U.S. Federal Interagency River Basin Committee’s Subcommittee on Benefits and Costs published a report entitled, \"Proposed Practices for Economic Analysis of River Basin Projects\" (also known as the \"Green Book\"), which became noteworthy for bringing in the language of welfare economics. In 1958, Otto Eckstein published \"Water-Resource Development: The Economics of Project Evaluation\", and Roland McKean published his \"Efficiency in Government Through Systems Analysis: With Emphasis on Water Resources Development\". The latter book is also considered a classic in the field of operations research. In subsequent years, several other important works appeared: Jack Hirshleifer, James DeHaven, and Jerome W. Milliman published a volume entitled \"Water Supply: Economics, Technology, and Policy\" (1960); and a group of Harvard scholars including Robert Dorfman, Stephen Marglin, and others published \"Design of Water-Resource Systems: New Techniques for Relating Economic Objectives, Engineering Analysis, and Governmental Planning\" (1962).\n\n\n\n"}

A first refusal right must have at least three parties: the owner, the third party or buyer and the option holder. In general, the owner must make the same offer to the option holder \"before\" making the offer to the buyer. The right of first refusal is similar in concept to a call option.\n\nAn ROFR can cover almost any sort of asset, including real estate, personal property, a patent license, a screenplay, or an interest in a business. It might also cover business transactions that are not strictly assets, such as the right to enter a joint venture or distribution arrangement. In entertainment, a right of first refusal on a concept or a screenplay would give the holder the right to make that movie first. Only if the holder turns it down may the owner then shop it around to other parties.\n\nBecause an ROFR is a contract right, the holder's remedies for breach are typically limited to recovery of damages. In other words, if the owner sells the asset to a third party without offering the holder the opportunity to purchase it first, the holder can then sue the owner for damages but may have a difficult time obtaining a court order to stop or reverse the sale. However, in some cases the option becomes a property right that may be used to invalidate an improper sale.\n\nROFR also arises in visitation agreements/orders in divorce cases. In such cases, an ROFR may require a custodial parent to offer parenting time to the non-custodial parent (rather than having a child supervised by a third party) any time that the custodial parent or his/her family is unable to exercise his/her right to parenting time (e.g., the custodial parent needs to travel out of town). Under these circumstances a breach may result in a finding of contempt and any remedies for contempt.\n\nAn ROFR differs from a Right of First Offer (ROFO, also known as a Right of First Negotiation) in that the ROFO merely obliges the owner to undergo exclusive good faith negotiations with the rights holder before negotiating with other parties. A ROFR is an option to enter a transaction on exact or approximate transaction terms. A ROFO is merely an agreement to negotiate.\n\nROFR: Abe owns a house and Bo offers to buy that house for $1 million. However, Carl holds a right of first refusal to purchase the house. Therefore, before Abe can sell the house to Bo, he must first offer it to Carl for the $1 million that Bo is willing to buy it for. If Carl accepts, he buys the house instead of Bo. If Carl declines, Bo may now buy the house at the proposed $1 million price.\n\nROFO: Carl holds a ROFO instead of an ROFR. Before Abe can negotiate a deal with Bo, he must first try to sell the house to Carl on whatever terms Abe is willing to sell. If they reach an agreement, Abe sells the house to Carl. However, if they fail, then Abe is free to start fresh negotiations with Bo without any restriction as to price or terms.\n\nThe following are all variations on the basic ROFR:\n\n\nMany other variations are possible. A fully drafted ROFR addresses all of the types of issues and more, and in the case of valuable or complex transactions it is subject to negotiation and review by business transaction attorneys. However, many ROFR are not completely specified. Even the best drafted ROFR agreements suffer a high risk of dispute and litigation because they are anticipating future transactions and contingencies that are unknowable when the ROFR originates.\n\nIn venture capital deals, the right of first refusal is a term sheet provision permitting existing investors in a company to accept or refuse the purchase of equity shares offered by the company, before third parties have access to the deal. The main goal of the provision is to allow investors to prevent ownership dilution as the company raises additional capital. Typically, the provision will exempt certain types of shares, such as those in an employee pool, or shares issued to equipment loaners or lessors. Startup companies are advised to attempt negotiating out this right, because it enables existing investors to send stronger (potentially negative) signals to new investors, and consequently drive down the company's valuation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18844117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18844117", "title": "Russian oven", "text": "Russian oven\n\nA Russian oven or Russian stove () is a unique type of masonry stove that first appeared in the 15th century. It is used both for cooking and domestic heating in traditional Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian households. The Russian oven burns firewood or wood manufacturing waste. \n\nA Russian oven is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the oven is constructed.\n\nA brick flue () in the attic, sometimes with a chamber for smoking food, is required to slow down the cooling of the oven.\n\nThe Russian oven is usually in the centre of the log hut (izba). The builders of Russian ovens are referred to as \"stovemakers\" (\"pechniki\"). Good stovemakers always had a high status among the population. A badly built Russian oven may be very difficult to repair, bake unevenly, smoke, or retain heat poorly.\n\nThere are many designs for the Russian oven. For example, there is a variant with two hearths (one of the hearths is used mainly for fast cooking, the other mainly for heating in winter). In addition, there also existed tiled oven in early Russian culture.\n\nVarious types of firewood can be used, for example birch or pine. Aspen is the least efficient for heating a Russian oven because the amount needed is twice that of other woods.\n\nBesides its use for domestic heating, in winter people may sleep on top of the oven to keep warm: the large thermal mass (a proper Russian stove weighs about 2 tons) and layered design (in many variants the hot flue is separated from the outer brick shell with a layer of sand or pebbles) ensure that the outer surface of the stove is safe to touch. The oven was and is used until today for cooking and had a strong influence on the taste of Russian cuisine. Dishes where the oven is used are pancakes to bake or pies. The porridge or the pancakes prepared in such an oven may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range. The process of cooking in the Russian oven can be called \"languor\" — holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature. Foods that are believed to acquire a distinctive character from being prepared in a Russian oven include baked milk, pastila candies, mushrooms cooked in sour cream, or even a simple potato. Bread is put in and taken out from the oven using a special wooden paddle on a long shank. Cast iron pots with soup or milk are taken out with a two-pronged metal stick.\n\nAs well as warming and cooking, the Russian oven can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during World War II some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in ovens. In former times the oven was used to treat winter diseases by warming the sick person's body inside it.\n\nEspecially because of the harsh winter the Russian oven was a major element of Russian life and consequently it often appears in folklore, in particular in Russian fairy tales. The legendary hero Ilya Muromets was able to walk after 33 years of incapacity after being laid on a Russian oven. Emelya, according to the legend, was so reluctant to leave it that he simply flew and rode on it. Baba Yaga according to the legend baked lost children in her oven. Often in those fairy tales the oven received human characteristics. For example, in \"The Magic Swan Geese\" a girl meets a Russian oven, and asks it for directions. The oven offers the girl rye buns, and subsequently, on the girl's return, hides her from the swan geese. One of the main features of the oven in Russian fairy tales is that it serves as a means of transport, virtually the counterpart on the ground to the magic carpet. \n\n"}
{"id": "29686595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29686595", "title": "Russian tea culture", "text": "Russian tea culture\n\nTea is a part of Russian culture. Russian tea is brewed and can be served sweet, and hot or cold.\n\nSince 1638, tea has had a rich and varied history in Russia. Due in part to Russia's cold northern climate, it is today considered the \"de facto\" national beverage, one of the most popular beverages in the country, and is closely associated with traditional Russian culture. It was traditionally drunk at afternoon tea, but has since spread as an all day drink, especially at the end of meals served with dessert. An important aspect of the Russian tea culture is the ubiquitous Russian tea brewing device known as a samovar, which has become a symbol of hospitality and comfort.\nTea in Russia was introduced in 1638, when a Mongolian ruler donated to Tsar Michael I four poods (65–70 kg) of tea. According to Jeremiah Curtin, it was possibly in 1636 that Vassili Starkov was sent as envoy to the Altyn Khan. As a gift to the Tsar, he was given 250 pounds of tea. Starkov at first refused, seeing no use for a load of dead leaves, but the Khan insisted. Thus was tea introduced to Russia. In 1679, Russia concluded a treaty on regular tea supplies from China via camel caravan in exchange for furs. The Chinese ambassador to Moscow made a gift of several chests of tea to Alexis I. However, the difficult trade route made the cost of tea extremely high, so that the beverage became available only to royalty and the very wealthy of Russia. In 1689, the Treaty of Nerchinsk was signed that formalized Russia's sovereignty over Siberia, and also marked the creation of the Tea Road that traders used between Russia and China.\n\nBetween the Treaty of Nerchinsk and the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), Russia would increase its caravans going to China for tea, but only through state dealers. In 1706, Peter the Great made it illegal for any merchants to trade in Beijing. In 1786, Catherine the Great established regular imports of tea. By the time of Catherine's death in 1796, Russia was importing more than 3 million pounds by camel caravan in the form of loose tea and tea bricks, enough tea to considerably lower the price so that middle and lower class Russians could afford the beverage.\n\nThe peak year for the Kiakhta tea trade was in 1824, and the peak year for the tea caravans was 1860. From then, they started to decline when the first leg of the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed in 1880. Faster train service allowed for tea to be imported from nearly a year and a half to eventually just over a week. The decline in Chinese tea in the mid 19th century in turn meant that Russia began to import more tea from Odessa, and London. By 1905, horse drawn tea transport had ended, and by 1925 caravan as the sole means of transport for tea had ended. In 2002, Russia imported some 162,000 metric tons of tea.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Wissotzky Tea had become the largest tea firm in the Russian Empire. By the early 20th century, Wissotzky was the largest tea manufacturer in the world. \n\nBy the end of the 18th century, tea prices had moderately declined. The first local tea plant was set in Nikitsk botanical gardens in 1814, while the first industrial tea plantation was established in 1885. The tea industry did not take off until World War I, and greatly expanded following World War II. However, by the mid 1990s, tea production came to a standstill. Today, the main area in Russia for tea production is in the vicinity of Sochi.\n\nTraditionally, black tea is the most common tea in Russia, but green tea is becoming more popular.\n\nTraditional tea in Russia includes the traditional type known as Russian Caravan as it was originally imported from China via camel caravan. As the trip was very long, usually taking as long as 16 or 18 months, the tea acquired its distinctive smoky flavor from the caravan's campfires. Today, this tea is often given its smoky flavor after fermentation or is a keemun or a \"black or oolong from China or Formosa (Taiwan) with a hint of smoky Lapsang Souchong or Tarry Souchong.\" \n\nA notable feature of Russian tea culture is the two-step brewing process. Firstly, tea concentrate called zavarka (Russian: заварка) is prepared: a quantity of dry tea sufficient for several persons is brewed in a small teapot. Then, each person pours some quantity of this concentrate into the cup and mixes it with hot water; thus, one can make one's tea as strong as one wants, according to one's taste. Sugar, lemon, honey or jam can then be added freely.\n\nAccording to William Pokhlyobkin, tea in Russia was not regarded as a self-dependent beverage; thus, even the affluent classes adorned it with a jam, syrup, cakes, cookies, candies, lemon and other sweets. This is similar to the archaic idiom \"чай да сахар\" (tea and sugar). The Russian language utilizes some memes pertaining to tea consumption, including \"чайку-с?\" (\"some tea?\" in an archaic manner), used by the pre-Revolutionary attendants. The others are \"гонять чаи\" (chase the teas, i.e. drinking the tea for overly prolonged periods) and \"побаловаться чайком\" (indulging in tea). Tea was made a significant element of cultural life by the literati of the Karamzinian circle. By the mid-19th century tea had won over the town class, the merchants and the petty bourgeoisie. This is reflected in the dramas of Alexander Ostrovsky. Since Ostrovsky's time, duration and the amount of consumed tea are appreciated in the tea-drinking. Alexander Pushkin in \"Eugene Onegin\" displayed the role of tea in establishing romantic relations:\nIn the Soviet period, tea-drinking was extremely popular in the daily life of office workers (female secretaries, laboratory assistants, etc.). Tea brands of the time were nicknamed \"the brooms\" (Georgian) and \"the tea with an elephant\" (Indian). Tea was an immutable element of kitchen life among the intelligentsia in 1960s-'70s.\n\nIn pre-Revolutionary Russia there was a joke \"что после чаю следует?\" ('what follows after tea?') with the correct answer being \"the resurrection of the dead\" from the Nicene Creed. This is based on the word \"чаю\" (\"chayu\"), the homograph designating formerly \"I expect\" (\"look for\" in the creed) and the genitive case of the word \"tea\", still in use.\n\nWithin Russia, tea preparation differs, but usually includes lemon, and sugar or jam. Tea sachets are widely popular, but when a teapot is used it is very common to make a strong brew, then pour some into a cup and top it with hot or boiling water, adding milk and sugar afterwards.\n\nIn the 19th century, Russians drank their tea with a cube of sugar (from sugarloaf) held between their teeth. The tradition still exists. \n\nTea is very popular in Russian prisons. Traditional mind-altering substances such as alcohol are typically prohibited, and very high concentrations, called \"chifir\" are used as a substitute.\n\nTraditional forms of Russian tea ware include the Russian tea brewing urn called a samovar, the Lomonosov tea sets adorned with a cobalt blue net design and 22 karat gold, and traditional Russian tea glass holders.\n\nThere is a beverage called \"Russian Tea\" which likely originated in America. This drink is especially popular in the Southeastern United States where is it traditionally served at social events during Advent and Christmastide. Recipes vary, but the most common ingredients are loose black tea, orange juice (or orange peel), cinnamon, and cloves; some recipes use instant tea powder. Other juices such as lemon and pineapple are sometimes called for. Cream may also be added when serving. A homemade 'instant' variety, often using Tang, has become a popular stocking stuffer in recent decades.\n\nThe drink is served hot and often an evening or after-meal beverage. However, iced versions are sometimes offered with meals at cafés.\n\nDespite the name, \"Russian Tea\" probably has no link to its namesake. References to \"Russian Tea\" and instructions have been found in American newspapers and cookbooks dating as early as the 1880s.\n\n"}
{"id": "10162426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10162426", "title": "Seattle riot of 1886", "text": "Seattle riot of 1886\n\nThe Seattle riot of 1886 occurred on February 6–9, 1886, in Seattle, Washington, amidst rising anti-Chinese sentiment caused by intense labor competition and in the context of an ongoing struggle between labor and capital in the Western United States. The dispute arose when a mob affiliated with a local Knights of Labor chapter formed small committees to carry out a forcible expulsion of all Chinese from the city. Violence erupted between the Knights of Labor rioters and federal troops ordered in by President Grover Cleveland. The incident resulted in the removal of over 200 Chinese people from Seattle and left 2 militia men and 3 rioters seriously injured.\nDuring the 1840s, the California Gold Rush brought many Chinese to the United States. Many had come in the hopes of improving their economic conditions, and their arrival was initially welcomed due to labor shortages. According to information from the U.S. Census, the Chinese population increased at a dramatic pace until 1890, though they never accounted for more than 0.2 percent of the U.S. population through the 1800s.\n\nAfter the Gold Rush, many Chinese people moved into the northwest territories of Oregon, Washington, and Montana in search of work, especially with the new mining opportunities and railroad expansion. The Chinese workers developed a reputation for being efficient and willing to work long hours, but also for accepting less pay than white workers. This increased racial tensions in the West, as companies recruited Chinese workers in order to undercut higher-paid white workers.\n\nViolent outbreaks against the Chinese occurred as early as the 1860s and continued to intensify in the 1870s, especially in California. As corporations continued to flood the labor market with Chinese workers, many Chinese were excluded from or refused to join unions in the fight against capital, which angered and threatened the white European immigrants who constituted these organizations. Unions such as the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor supported legislation that limited or excluded Chinese immigration. By the mid-1880s, a wave of anti-Chinese violence grew and spread into the Pacific Northwest.\n\nRock Springs was just the first outbreak of many in the West of anti-Chinese violence. It occurred in Rock Springs, in the Wyoming Territory. In the 1870s, the Union Pacific coal mines began firing white strikers and replacing its previously all-white work force with cheaper Chinese laborers. The incident occurred on September 2, 1885. Fighting broke out in the mines between white and Chinese laborers. A mob destroyed and set aflame many Chinese homes, causing an estimated $140,000 of damage, killing 28, injuring 14, and sending the remaining immigrants fleeing into the surrounding area. Later, Governor Francis Warren telegraphed President Cleveland requesting federal military assistance, due to a report that had surfaced that the Chinese, who had fled the town earlier, had now regrouped in nearby Evanston and had armed themselves.\n\nThe Chinese and anti-Chinese mobs were set to meet, which prompted the commitment of federal troops to Rock Springs. The soldiers were not under orders to protect the Union Pacific Railroad or to protect the Chinese, as required by the Burlingame Treaty of 1868 with China. Officially, troops were deployed to Rock Springs to \"prevent any disruption to the United States mail or the routes over which they are received.\" This decision was likely made to avoid setting the precedent of committing federal troops to stamp out anti-Chinese violence, which the Army lacked the resources, time, and numbers to achieve.\n\nEventually, diplomatic pressure from the Burlingame Treaty prompted President Cleveland to issue a new order to protect Chinese laborers \"at points of threatened or actual violence\" now that troops had been committed. The Chinese were then led by four companies of federal troops into the town without incident. This set a precedent for sending federal troops to protect the Chinese immigrants from frequent violence in the area, though the Cleveland administration evaded responsibility for the incident. It also set a precedent because not a single rioter was punished. They did pay a sum of $150,000 to the Chinese government, though never to the immigrants themselves. Federal forces remained in the area for another 14 years after the massacre, and, for the most part, white and union influence disappeared in the wake of the riot.\n\nTensions in Seattle continued to rise when the Chinese laborers shifted from mining and railroad construction to urban labor. Many whites felt as though the Chinese were driving them from the labor force by agreeing to work for less. They saw the Chinese as racially inferior \"semislaves\" who were unable to assimilate into the American way of life. Some argued that the hiring of Chinese workers would only serve to lower the standard of living for the average American working man in the West, who would be forced to accept lower wages to compete. Others asserted that the Chinese workers were stripping America of her wealth because many immigrants sent paychecks back to their families in China.\n\nMembers of the Knights of Labor were leaders of the organized movement against Chinese workers in Seattle. The Knights in Washington Territory were only loosely affiliated with the national organization. The chapter's organizer was Daniel Cronin, a 38-year-old carpenter who came to the Puget Sound area via California during the summer of 1885. Under Cronin's leadership, the Washington Knights of Labor went from a loose-knit band of workers to an organized and militant \"brotherhood\". In September 1885, Cronin warned Seattle's workers that riot and bloodshed would follow during the winter if the Chinese were not removed. It was Cronin and the leadership of the Knights of Labor who planned for the systematic expulsion of Seattle's Chinese; the group organized a territorial anti-Chinese congress and declared that all Chinese must leave Seattle by November 1, 1885. After forming local coordinating committees, Cronin stepped away from his post as Knights leader and left the Chinese expulsion, largely, to other individuals.\n\nDisgruntled over the presence of 3000+ Chinese immigrants in the Seattle-Tacoma corridor, the Washington Knights organized a meeting on the 28th of September. The meeting was presided over by Tacoma's mayor, Jacob Weisbach, and the assembled men concluded they must rid the area of \"Chinese slave labor\". They intended to speak to employers about their discharge, and thus formed local committees to enforce the expulsion if all Chinese were not removed from the town by November 1. Some Chinese were persuaded to evacuate at this point and between November 4–14, some 150 Chinese fled Seattle. This prompted territorial Governor Watson Squire to telegraph President Cleveland for troops, and he received soldiers under the command of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon by train the next morning. These soldiers never took action and were ordered back to garrison on November 17. The tensions did not end there, however, as Knights of Labor meetings continued through January. On February 6, 1886, the Knights again met and charged a six-man committee with delivering an ultimatum to the Chinese that they must leave Seattle or be forcibly removed.\n\nOn the morning of February 7, many \"committees\" forced their way into Chinese homes, demanding the Chinese pack their bags and report to the steamship \"Queen of the Pacific\" at 1pm. The committees set up wagons through Seattle's Chinatown to haul baggage down to the pier. After a search was conducted for Chinese who fled or hid, the committees led some 350 Chinese from Chinatown to the pier. Local Sheriff John McGraw was aroused to enforce law and order with his force of deputies, but McGraw was sympathetic to the plight of the Knights and simply protected the Chinese immigrants from violence on their way to the pier. When Governor Squire ordered the dispersal of the mob and the release of the Chinese, the riotous mob ignored him. Thus, Squire called for the local \"Seattle Rifles\" militia and requested the aid of federal troops to assist McGraw.\n\nMeanwhile, at the dock, rioters were significantly short of raising the funds needed to transport 350 people by steamship. Only 97 of 350 Chinese had their fare paid. U.S. Justice Greene heard of the incident through an angered Chinese merchant and issued a writ of habeas corpus which required the captain of the \"Queen\" to produce the Chinese in court the next morning. At midnight, McGraw along with local militia blocked 2 attempts by the mob to lead the remaining 253 Chinese to a train to Tacoma. McGraw defused the situation by ordering the train to leave before the mob could reach it.\n\nThe next morning, McGraw led the 97 passengers still on the \"Queen of the Pacific\" to the territorial court as ordered by Justice Greene. There was an incident along the way as the mob tried to block their progress and 8 Knights leaders were arrested. Once there, Greene informed the Chinese that they had a legal right to remain in the city. Though he promised to protect them, only 16 elected to stay and the rest were escorted back to the ship. By the time they had returned the mob had raised funds for the additional passage of 115 more Chinese and the boat set sail. It was agreed that the remaining 150 Chinese would depart on the steamship \"George Elder\" once funds had been raised.\n\nNews of the agreement failed to spread throughout Seattle. As McGraw, his deputies, and the militiamen tried to lead the Chinese back to their homes, a new mob formed, incensed at the arrest of their leaders. The militiamen clubbed members of the mob with rifle butts when progress was impeded. When members of the mob began to wrest the militia rifles, shots rang out and stopped only after 2 militia men and 3 rioters lay seriously injured. The mob backed off and prepared for another charge when an extra company of militiamen arrived and sent the crowd into a confused state. Once McGraw stated that those responsible for the shooting would be prosecuted, the crowd dispersed. When a third mob threatened the lives of the militiamen who fired upon the crowd, Governor Squire issued martial law.\n\nNeither Greene nor Squire believed that McGraw and his combined militia force would be able to enforce martial law in the territory, and federal troops arrived in Seattle on February 10 and found it \"devoid of traces...of the rioting\". Squire ended martial law and restored local civil order on February 23. Most troops were recalled, but two companies of troops were left in Seattle for another 4 months after the riot.\n\nThe increasingly common outbursts of anti-Chinese violence in the 1880s, like that of the Seattle riot, allowed Congress to pass the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act that completely barred the immigration of all Chinese workers into the United States. Congress then voted to extend the ban in 1892 and 1902. This led to a dramatically reduced Chinese population in the U.S. in the 1890s into the 1900s. Those who did leave were restricted from being replaced by other Chinese immigrants.\nCongress paid $276,619.15 to the Chinese government in compensation for the rioting, but the actual victims never saw any such compensation. Though 13 men were tried in court in relation to the riot, not a single one was ever convicted of a crime. Both Mayor Henry Yesler and Sheriff McGraw were unseated in the following election.\n\nFew Chinese remained in the Seattle area following the riot. Many of the Chinese chose to return to China following the wave of racially inspired violence. There was a considerable loss of property because of their forced and hasty expulsion The Qing government could only look to secure indemnities for the Seattle riot, knowing that the guilty parties would likely never be brought to answer for their crimes. This was because federal and territorial authorities had been largely unwilling to assist in declaring martial law and arresting the criminals \n\nThe Chinese asked the advice of their Consuls in the U.S. and sent additional diplomats to investigate the matter and report back with possible actions. Ouyang Ming, the Chinese Consul-General of San Francisco concluded that the Chinese were not well liked by either the American public or the government. He proposed that the best way to prevent future harm to Chinese citizens was to bar all Chinese emigration to the states, feeling as though only trouble would result if things were left unchanged. Others, such as influential Governor-General Zhang Zhidang, disagreed. He proposed that the Chinese immigration policy remain fluid because of Chinese interests in the United States and it did.\n\nQing officials continued efforts in Washington to combat the unjust restrictions that were placed on Chinese immigrants following the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. The killing of Chinese gradually came to a stop in the years after 1886, however legislation restricting them continued. Protection of current and future Chinese in America proved difficult to achieve \n\nChinese consul Goon Dip, a Chinese businessman, was largely responsible for the 2nd wave of Chinese immigration into Seattle and founded the cradle for Seattle's second Chinatown. Soon Japanese and Filipino immigrants also gravitated to the area because of the area's inexpensive housing and storefronts for their own businesses and restaurants.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Chinatown was re-established in Seattle as a distinct and proud neighborhood. Many Chinese prospered despite lingering tensions. However, relations again soured after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan. Many Japanese Americans were rounded up in the spring of 1942 for \"internment\" camps throughout World War II. In response, many Chinese Americans in Seattle were forced to wear badges declaring that they were not Japanese.\n\nThe area's population continued to diversify following World War II, as an increasing number of Filipinos passed through or settled in the area. This prompted Seattle Mayor William Devin to promote a new name for the neighborhood, the \"International District,\" in 1951, though this still rankles some in the Chinese community.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3305169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3305169", "title": "Sexuality in India", "text": "Sexuality in India\n\nMulticultural India has developed its discourse on sexuality differently based on its distinct regions with their own unique cultures. However, one common aspect remains: the existence of a subtle conspiracy of silence and taboos that clouds the Indian world of sexual desires and expressions. The origins of this silence towards India's rich contributions to sexuality and shunning of it almost are to be found in the repurcussions of the colonial rule and of the Bible. This shaped the attitude and opinions Indian people hold about their sexuality today; one that is hegemonically hetereosexual and must aim at procreation after marriage. However, from the second half of the 20th century, several significant voices have challenged this silence imposed over sexuality and questioned the roles assigned to desires within the socio-political and artistic fields. Many recently published studies confirm the richness of India's erotic past and popular voices are now spotlighting this for the masses to know. A myriad of folk tales, sculptures like those in Khajuraho, religious poetry and scholary documents reveal homoerotic content and how love and sex between women, men, gods, semi-gods and goddesses was expressed.\n\nThe seeming contradictions of Indian attitudes towards sex (more broadly - sexuality) can be best explained through the context of history. India played a role in shaping understandings of sexuality, and it could be argued that one of the first pieces of literature that treated \"Kama\" as a science came from the Indian subcontinent. It may be argued that historically, India pioneered the use of sexual education through various art forms like sculptures, paintings, and pieces of literature. As in all societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in \"self-gratification\" lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Moreover, there are distinct cultural differences seen through the course of history across India.\n\nThe origins of the current Indian culture can be traced back to the Indus Valley civilisation, which was contemporaneous with the ancient Egyptian and Sumerian civilisations, around 2700 BCE. During this period, the first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of Hinduism, Buddhism. These ancient texts, the Rig Veda among few others, reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. The epics of ancient India, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, which may have been first composed as early as 500 BCE, had a huge effect on the culture of Asia, influencing later Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan culture and South East Asian culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions. It seems that polygamy was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice both polyandry and polygyny as a way of preserving dynastic succession.\n\nNudity in art was considered acceptable in southern India, as shown by the paintings at Ajanta and the sculptures of the time. It is likely that as in most countries with tropical climates, Indians from some regions did not need to wear clothes, and other than for fashion, there was no practical need to cover the upper half of the body. This is supported by historical evidence, which shows that men in many parts of ancient India mostly dressed only the lower half of their bodies with clothes and upper part of body was covered by gold and precious stones, jewellery, while women used to wear traditional sarees made of silk and expensive clothes as a symbol of their wealth.\n\nAs Indian civilisation further developed and the writing of the Upanishads around 500 BCE, it was somewhere between the 1st and 6th centuries that the Kama Sutra, originally known as Vatsyayana Kamasutram ('Vatsyayana's Aphorisms on Love'), was written. This philosophical work on kama shastra, or 'science of love', was intended as both an exploration of human desire, including infidelity, and a technical guide to pleasing a sexual partner within a marriage. This is not the only example of such a work in ancient India, but is the most widely known in modern times. It is probably during this period that the text spread to ancient China, along with Buddhist scriptures, where Chinese versions were written.\n\nIt is also during 10th century to 12th century that some of India's most famous ancient works of art were produced, often freely depicting romantic themes and situations. Examples of this include the depiction of Apsaras, roughly equivalent to nymphs or sirens in European and Arabic mythology, on some ancient temples. The best and most famous example of this can be seen at the Khajuraho complex in central India built around 9th to 12th century.\n\nAlthough the Portuguese and French had managed to set up some small enclaves in India, such as Goa, where the Catholic inquisition forcibly converted some of the population of the small region to Catholicism, it was the arrival of the British, who managed to annex the entire Indian subcontinent through alliances with various monarchs, that had the largest effect on the culture of India and its attitudes to sex. Rule was indirect at first through the East India Company whose administrators did not necessarily interfere extensively and even took advantage of the tattered remnants of Hindu liberalism in sexual matters, for example through liaisons and by maintaining de facto wives. At the same time there were significant number of orientalists who saw India as a great civilisation, invented the field of Indology, and advocated a more accepting point of view.\n\nA number of movements were set up by prominent citizens, such as the Brahmo Samaj in Bengal and the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay Presidency, to work for the 'reform' of Indian private and public life. Paradoxically while this new consciousness led to the promotion of education for women and (eventually) a raise in the age of consent and reluctant acceptance of remarriage for widows, it also produced a puritanical attitude to sex even within marriage and the home. The liberality of pre-colonial India had also respected the home and relationships.\n\nConservative views of sexuality are now the norm in the modern republic of India, and South Asia in general. It is often argued that this is partly related to the effect of colonial influence, as well as to the puritanical elements of Islam in countries like Pakistan (e.g. the Islamic revivalist movements, which has influenced many Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh). However, such views were also prevalent in the pre-colonial era, especially since the advent of Islam in India which brought purdah as ideal for Muslim women. Before the gradual spread of Islam largely through the influence of Sufis, there seems to be evidence of liberal attitudes towards sexuality and nudity in art. However, scholars debate the degree to which Islam, as a mass and varied phenomenon was responsible for this shift.\n\nWhile during the 1960s and 1970s in the west, many people discovered the ancient culture of sexual liberalism in India as a source for western free love movements, and neo-Tantric philosophy, India itself is currently the more prudish culture, embodying Victorian sensibilities that were abandoned decades ago in their country of origin. However, with increased exposure to world culture due to globalisation, and the proliferation of progressive ideas due to greater education and wealth, India is beginning to go through a western-style sexual revolution of its own, especially in cosmopolitan cities.\n\nModern issues that affect India, as part of the sexual revolution, have become points of argument between conservative and liberal forces, such as political parties and religious pressure groups. These issues are also matters of ethical importance in a nation where freedom and equality are guaranteed in the constitution.\n\n The entertainment industry is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of Indian society in general. Historically, Indian television and film has lacked the frank depiction of sex; until recently, even kissing scenes were considered taboo. On the other hand, rape scenes or scenes showing sexual assault were shown. Currently, some Indian states show soft-core sexual scenes and nudity in films, whilst other areas do not. Mainstream films are still largely catered for the masses.\n\nThe distribution and production of pornography are both illegal in India; however, accessing pornography in private is not. Regardless, softcore films have been common since the late 1970s, and many directors have produced them. Magazine publications like \"Debonair (magazine),\" \"Fantasy,\" \"Chastity,\" \"Royal Magazine,\" and \"Dafa 302\" exist in India, and more than 50 million Indians are believed to see porn on a daily basis.\n\nThe Information Technology Act, Chapter XI Paragraph 67, the Government of India clearly considers online pornography as a punishable offence. The CEO of the Indian subsidiary of eBay was charged with various criminal offences for allowing the trading of a CD on the website that contained pornography.\n\nWhile trade in sex was frowned upon in ancient India, it was tolerated and regulated so as to reduce the damage that it could do. Unfortunately, however, the stigmatisation that has arisen in modern times has left the many poor sex workers with problems of exploitation and rampant infection, including AIDS, and worse, it has allowed a huge people-trafficking industry, like that of Eastern Europe, to take hold. Many poor young women are kidnapped from villages and sold into sexual slavery. There have been some recent efforts to regulate the Indian sex industry.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31235956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31235956", "title": "Statistical correlations of criminal behaviour", "text": "Statistical correlations of criminal behaviour\n\nThe statistical correlations of criminal behavior explore the associations of specific non-criminal factors with specific crimes.\n\nThe field of criminology studies the dynamics of crime. Most of these studies use correlational data; that is, they attempt to identify various factors are associated with specific categories of criminal behavior. Such correlational studies led to hypotheses about the causes of these crimes.\n\n\"The Handbook of Crime Correlates\" (2009) is a systematic review of 5200 empirical studies on crime that have been published worldwide. A crime consistency score represents the strength of relationships. The scoring depends on how consistently a statistically significant relationship was identified across multiple studies. The authors claim that the review summarizes most of what is currently known about the variables associated with criminality.\n\nCrime occurs most frequently during the second and third decades of life. Males commit more crime overall and more violent crime than females. They commit more property crime except shoplifting, which is about equally distributed between the genders. Males appear to be more likely to reoffend. Measures related to arousal such as heart rate and skin conductance are low among criminals. Mesomorphic or muscular body type is positively correlated with criminality, in particular with sexual crimes. Testosterone levels positively correlate to criminal behavior.\n\nWhen controlling for age and sex, strong genetic correlates with criminality. Low monoamine oxidase activity and low 5-HIAA levels tend to be found among criminals. Monoamine oxidase A (dubbed the \"warrior gene\" in the popular press) is strongly tied to an increased tendency towards violent crime. In addition, CDH13, a gene previously tied to an increased risk of substance abuse, has been tied to violent crime. These tendencies are ostensibly related, as the majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime in Finland do so under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The presence of the genetic profile is not determinative, although it increases the likelihood of delinquency in cases where other factors are present. Ferguson stated, 'a large percentage of our behaviour in terms of violence or aggression is influenced by our biology - our genes - and our brain anatomy.' Schnupp stated, 'To call these alleles \"genes for violence\" would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime.'\n\nAssociated factors include race and crime and status as an immigrant. In some countries, ethnically/racially diverse geographical areas have higher crime rates compared to homogeneous areas, and in other countries, it is the other way around. Some studies on immigrants found higher rates of crime among these populations; these rates vary according to the country of origin (immigrants from some regions having lower crime rates than the indigenous population). Notions about the propensity for immigrants to commit crime vary among geographical regions. Likewise, the propensity for immigrants to commit more or less crime than the indigenous population also varies geographically. For instance within the United States, census data shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crime than residents who were born within the United States.\n\nAssociated factors include maternal smoking during pregnancy, Low birth weight, perinatal trauma/birth complications, child maltreatment, low parent-child attachment, marital discord/family discord, alcoholism and drug use in the family, low parental supervision/monitoring, family size and birth order, nocturnal enuresis or bed wetting, bullying, school disciplinary problems, truancy, low grade point average, dropping out of high school and childhood lead exposure.\n\nAssociated factors include high alcohol use, alcohol abuse and alcoholism, high illegal drug use and dependence, early age of first sexual intercourse and the number of sexual partners, social isolation, criminal peer groups and gang membership.\n\nA few studies have found a negative correlation between religiosity and criminality. A 2001 meta-analysis found, \"religious beliefs and behaviors exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior\". An individual with high religious saliency (i.e. expressing the high importance of religion in their life) is less likely to be associated with criminal activities; similarly, an individual who regularly attends religious services or is highly involved in them tends to be less involved in criminality, with the exception of property damage. Other meta-analysis research suggests that those who subscribe to more orthodox religious beliefs are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than those who do not.\n\nA 1997 study of six public schools found no statistically significant negative correlations between religiosity and crime, or religiosity and drug use, and the only relationship between religiosity and alcohol was statistically significant. A more recent review concludes that there are insufficient data to indicate any correlation between religiosity and crime.\n\nA 2016 study found statistically significant evidence that political ideology is moderately correlated with involvement in non-violent but not violent crime, among White individuals and particularly among White women. It suggests that liberal self-classification can, among some groups, be positively associated with non-violent criminal behavior compared to conservative self-classification.\n\nAssociated factors include childhood conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder (also associated with each other), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, minor depression, clinical depression, depression in the family, suicidal tendencies and schizophrenia.\n\nThe American Psychological Association's 1995 report \"Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns\" stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was -0.2. In his book \"\" (1998), Arthur Jensen cited data which showed that IQ was generally negatively associated with crime among people of all races, peaking between 80 and 90. Learning disability is a substantial discrepancy between IQ and academic performance and is associated with crime. Slow reading development may be particularly relevant.\n\nSeveral personality traits are associated with criminality: impulsivity, psychoticism, sensation-seeking, (low) self control, childhood aggression, low empathy and low altruism.\n\nSocioeconomic status (usually measured using the three variables income (or wealth), occupational level, and years of education) correlates negatively with criminality, except for self-reported illegal drug use. Higher parental socioeconomic status probably has an inverse relationship with crime. Unstable employment and high frequency of unemployment correlate positively with criminality. Low socioeconomic status is thought to be positively correlated with higher levels of stress, and therefore the mental and psychological ill-effects of stress. These higher stress levels would probably be correlated positively with the propensity to commit a crime. \n\nSomewhat inconsistent evidence indicates a positive relationship between low income levels, the percentage of population under the poverty line, low education levels, and high income inequality in an area with more crime in said area.\n\nA World Bank study said, “Crime rates and inequality are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling for other crime determinants.”\n\nAssociated factors include areas with population size, neighborhood quality, residential mobility, tavern and alcohol density, gambling and tourist density, proximity to the equator, temperature (weather and season). The higher crime rate in the southern US largely disappears after controlling for non-climatic factors.\n\nChildren whose parents did not want children are more likely to commit crimes. Such children are less likely to succeed in school, and are more likely to live in poverty. They tend to have lower mother-child relationship quality.\n\nBiosocial criminology is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as genetics, neuropsychology and evolutionary psychology.\n\nAggressive behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: \nAbnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by stress, either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress.\n\nIn environmental terms, the theory that crime rates and lead exposure are connected, with increases in the latter causing increases in the former, has attracted much scientific analysis. In 2011, a report published by the official United Nations News Centre remarked, \"Ridding the world of leaded petrol, with the United Nations leading the effort in developing countries, has resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, 1.2 million fewer premature deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes\". The California State University did the specific study. Then U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) executive director Achim Steiner argued, \"Although this global effort has often flown below the radar of media and global leaders, it is clear that the elimination of leaded petrol is an immense achievement on par with the global elimination of major deadly diseases.\"\n\n"}

The term is used in sociology to examine individuals' interactions with society and is contrasted with technophobia.\n\nOn a psychodynamic level, technophilia generates the expression of its opposite, technophobia. Technophilia and technophobia are the two extremes of the relationship between technology and society. The technophile regards most or all technology positively, adopts new forms of technology enthusiastically and sees it as a means to improve life, whilst some may even view it as a means to combat social problems.\n\nThe term technophilia is used as a way of highlighting how technology can evoke in humans strong positive futuristic feelings. However, the reverential attitude towards technology that technophilia produces can sometimes inhibit realistic appraisals of the social and environmental impacts of technology on society. Technophiles do not fear of the effects of technological developments on society, as do technophobes. Technological determinism is the theory that humanity has little power to resist the influence that technology has on society.\n\nThe word technophile is said to have originated in the 1960s as an \"unflattering word introduced by technophobes.\" \n\nMany forms of technology are seen as venerable because the user experiences them as the embodiment of their own narcissism. Technophiles enjoy using technology and focus on the egocentric benefits of technology rather than seeing the potential issues associated with using technology too frequently. The notion of addiction is often negatively associated with technophilia, and describes technophiles who become too dependent on the forms of technology they possess.\n\nTechnophiles may view technology's interaction with society as creating a utopia, cyber or otherwise, and a strong indescribable futuristic feeling. \"In the utopian stories, technologies are seen as natural societal developments, improvements to daily life, or as forces that will transform reality for the better. Dystopian reactions emphasize fears of losing control, becoming dependent, and being unable to stop change\". Both utopian and dystopian streams are weaved in Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" (1932) and George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21350273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21350273", "title": "Two-child policy", "text": "Two-child policy\n\nA two-child policy is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children. It has previously been used in Vietnam. In British Hong Kong in the 1970s, citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit (although it was not mandated by law), and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies. Since 2016, it has been implemented in China, replacing the country's previous one-child policy.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Chinese citizens were encouraged to have only one child. The ongoing Cultural Revolution and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors. During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3. (The colloquial term \"births per woman\" is usually formalized as the \"Total Fertility Rate\" (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.)\n\nAs China's youngest generation (born under the one-child policy, which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) came of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves. After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013, most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child.\n\nHan Chinese living in rural areas were often permitted to have two children, as exceptions existed if the first child was a daughter. Because of cases such as these, as well as urban couples who simply paid a fine (or \"social maintenance fee\") to have more children, the overall fertility rate of mainland China is, in fact, closer to two children per family than to one child per family (1.8). In addition, since 2012, Han Chinese in southern Xinjiang were allowed to have two children. This, along with incentives and restrictions against higher Muslim Uyghur fertility, was seen as attempt to counter the threat of Uyghur separatism.\n\nOn October 29, 2015, Xinhua reported the change in the existing law to a two-child policy citing a statement from the Communist Party of China. The new policy allowing Chinese couples to have two children was proposed in order to help address the aging issue in China. On December 27, 2015, the new law was passed in the session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, which governs country's laws, effective from January 1, 2016.\n\nIn 2018, about two years after the new policy reform, China is facing new ramifications from the two-child policy. Since the revision of the one-child policy, 90 million women have become eligible to have a second child. According to \"The Economist\", the new two-child policy may have negative implications on gender roles, with new expectations from females to bear more children and to abandon their careers.\n\nAfter the reform, China saw a short-lived boost in fertility rate for 2016. Chinese women gave birth to 17.2 million babies in 2016, but declined by 3.5% in 2017. Husbands still have greater marital power, thus increasing fertility pressure on their female counterpart. The dynamic of relationships (amount of \"power\" held by each parent), and the amount of resources each parent has contributes to the struggle for dominance. Resources would be items such as income, and health insurance. Dominance would be described as who has the final say in pregnancy, who has to resign in their career for maternal/parental leave. However, females have shown interest in a second child if the first child did not possess the desired gender.\n\nChinese couples have also polled and stated that they would rather invest in one child opposed to two children. To add, another concern for couples would be the high costs of raising another child; China's childcare system needs to be furthered developed. The change in cultural norms appears to be having negative consequences and leads to fear of a large aging population with smaller younger generations; thus the lack of workforce to drive the economy.\n\nIn May 2018, it was reported that the Chinese authorities were in the process of ending their population control policies.\n\nIn British Hong Kong, the Eugenics League was founded in 1936, which became The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong in 1950. The organization provides family planning advice, sex education, and birth control services to the general public of Hong Kong. In the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the \"Two is Enough\" campaign, which reduced the general birth rate through educational means. The organization founded the International Planned Parenthood Federation, with its counterparts in seven other countries.\nThe total fertility rate in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world.\nAlthough the \"Two is Enough\" campaign found widespread approval, it does not reflect current government policy in supporting families. Tax allowances of 100,000 HK$ per child can be claimed for up to 9 children. Furthermore, parents who have fallen into hardship can apply for special assistance from the state. This is a means-tested financial benefit, which is not limited to a particular number of children either.\n\nIranian authorities encouraged families in Iran not to have more than two children when conducting family planning in Iran from early 1990s to late 2006. Iran's government \"declared that Islam favored families with only two children\", as one historian put it. When the family planning program was initiated, Iran's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives - pills, condoms, IUDs, implants, tubal ligations, and vasectomies.\nStarting in 2006, the government's population control policy changed when Ahmadinejad called for reversal of Iran's existing policy of \"two children is enough\" and later in 2012 Ayatollah Khamenei also stated that Iran's contraceptive policy made sense 20 years ago, \"but its continuation in later years was wrong ... Scientific and experts studies show that we will face population aging and reduction (in population) if the birth-control policy continues.\"\n\nIn Singapore, the two-child policy until the 1980s was called \"Stop at Two\".\n\nIn July 2007, the think tank Optimum Population Trust (now Population Matters) advocated what the \"Daily Mail\" described as a \"'two-child' policy\" to combat population increases and climate change in the United Kingdom. The article stated: \n\"According to the report, published by the Optimum Population Trust, Britain's high birth rate is a major factor in the current level of climate change, which can only be combated if families voluntarily limit the number of children they have.\"\nIn October 2012, the Conservative Party's proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a 'two-child policy', and has been fronted by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and former leader of the Conservative Party Iain Duncan Smith.\n\nIn April 2015, David Cameron denied any such plans to cut child benefits or tax credits. However, three months later, George Osborne, the then Finance Minister, announced that child tax credits would be limited to the first two children only. This was to come into force from the 2017/2018 financial year and apply to children born after that date only. From February 2019 however the policy becomes retrospective. Families making a new benefit claim (or whose circumstances change) will have the 2-child policy applied to them irrespective of when their children were born.\n\nThe two-child policy took effect on 5 April 2017. One particular aspect of the new rules, termed the \"rape clause\", has caused controversy. Although the policy excludes all but the first two children from all available benefits, an exemption can be applied for if the conception of the third and any further children occurred as a result of the rape of the claimant. A woman wishing to claim this exemption must fill in an eight-page form: \n\"The form requires women wanting to be eligible for the exemption to sign a declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex – and giving the child’s name. They must sign a declaration reading: 'I believe the non-consensual conception exemption applies to my child.' They must also sign another declaration that says: 'I confirm that I am not living with the other parent of this child.'\"\nThat the woman must thereby identify the child in question (which is thought to be assigned a tax code created for this exemption), that first or second children conceived by rape do not count towards this exemption and that women who are still living with their abusers are not eligible are just some of the aspects of the rape clause that caused widespread condemnation. Ruth Graham, writing for Slate, summarises the issues surrounding this new policy thus:\n\"The policy and the exemption have received harsh criticism from a wide variety of sources since they were announced in 2015. One member of parliament called the exemption implementation 'inhumane and barbaric.' Feminists have pointed out the cuts disproportionately affect women. A coalition of the U.K.’s largest Christian denominations and Jewish groups pointed out that the policy discriminates against people whose religion compels them to have larger families. A United Nations committee on children’s rights asked the British government to explain the policy last year, because of concerns about women having to somehow prove they were raped.\"\n\nVietnam has had a population policy for over 50 years. It was launched by the Vietnamese government in the early 1960s in North Vietnam and continues in a modified form today, throughout all of Vietnam (not just the north). The policy emphasizes the official family-size goal to be \"một hoặc hai con,\" which means \"one or two children.\"\n\nIn 2014, Vietnam had an estimated population of 92.5 million people, which represented 1.28% of the total world population. Currently, the total fertility rate of Vietnam is 1.8 (births per woman), which is below the replacement-level fertility of 2.1, the rate \"at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next\" according to the World Resources Institute.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region. North Vietnam became the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and had a communist government, whereas South Vietnam became the Republic of Vietnam and was more aligned with the United States and other Western nations. In 1963, North Vietnam began a policy advocating a two-child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population. Vietnam's family planning policy was developed before those of other countries, such as China and India, the government used a system of information, education, communication (IEC) campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population. After the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975 under the Communist Party, there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the North to the rest of Vietnam, which extended into the next decade. Though the government of the Republic of Vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy, inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented.\n\nIn 1982, the Vietnam government practiced various family planning measures, including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the National Committee for Population and Family Planning. After 1983, each family was required to limit the number of children to two. In 1985, the government increased incentives, such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors, and disincentives, such as penalties for violations in family planning.\n\nIn 1986, the Party implemented the Renovation (\"Đổi Mới\") Policy, which completely reversed the Communist Party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals. The aims of the Renovation Policy were to end Vietnam's economic isolation, increase competitiveness, and raise living standards. In an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population, the Vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates. In 1988, Council of Ministers issued an in-depth family planning policy, adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two. The detailed one-or-two-child policy of Vietnam was established nine years after China's one-child policy was implemented, and elements of China's policy are reflected in Vietnam's, such as the emphasis on marrying later, postponing childbearing age (22-years of age or older for women and 24-years of age or older for men), and spacing out birth of children (3–5 years apart). The state was required to supply free birth control devices (such as intrauterine loops, condoms, and birth control pills) and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions. Furthermore, if families did not comply with the two-child policy, they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers.\n\nIn 1993, the Vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified Vietnam of the one-to-two child policy as a mandatory national policy. The policy combined advertisements and education to promote a smaller family \"so people may enjoy a plentiful and happy life.\" The Vietnamese government explicitly linked the family planning policy with \"historical and cultural traditions, value structures and development objectives,\" encouraging a collectivist mindset in which individuals honor the needs of the nation above their own. The goal of the policy was to reduce the Vietnamese fertility rate to the replacement level of 2.1 by 2015, so that the country could have a stable population during mid-21st century. In 1997, the goal was accelerated to reach the replacement level by 2005, and the government subsequently integrated an increased use of abortion as a means to curb population growth.\n\nIn 2003, the Standing Parliamentary Committee of the National Assembly issued the highest legislative document on population titled the Population Ordinance, which restructured the official family planning policy. According to the ordinance, couples \"shall have the right to decide on the time to have babies, the number of children and the duration between child births.\" However, shortly after, the government implemented the National Strategy on Population 2001-2010, which again called for decreasing the fertility rate to the replacement level by 2005. This caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights. To address this confusion, the government issued Resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that \"to sustain high economic growth, Viet Nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country.\" However at this time, the population had already reached the goal of having a total fertility rate below the replacement level.\n\nIn 2009, the Population Ordinance was amended to again restrict the number of children to be one or two children, although individuals were allowed to decide the timing and spacing of their births. The government is currently drafting a new Law on Population to replace the Population Ordinance in 2015. However, there is disagreement between policy makers and academics on what should be included in the law.\n\nThe organizational structure of the two-child policy was housed under different governmental units since its conception in the 1960s. As the policy evolved from \"Initiation in the 1960s–1970s; Maturity in the 1980s–1990s; and Legalization in the 2000s–2010s\", the administration of the population policy also changed. From 1961-1983, the population program fell under the Population and Birth Control Unit. From 1984–2002, it was under the control of National Committee for Population and Family Planning. From 2003–2006, it was in the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children. Since 2007, the population program has been under the General Office for Population and Family Planning.\n\nAlthough the policy was advocated on the national level, the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives, instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments. Each family was required to have at most two children, and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement. Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice. Individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them, whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the Labor Medal for \"good realization of the population – family planning program\". The government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries, promotions, and sometimes even their jobs.\n\nCurrently, the effective population policy is the revised 2009 Population Ordinance which states that \"each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning, reproductive health care: (i) decide time and birth spacing; (ii) have one or two children, exceptional cases to be determined by the Government.\" Thus, individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have. Furthermore, later that year, Chief Executive Trương Tấn San stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of Vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020, and suggested that a new comprehensive Law on Population be introduced to the government by 2015.\n\nThe total fertility rate in Vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993, suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth. According to one demographic model, the Bongaarts' model of components of fertility, high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate. Furthermore, because of this policy, the population has fundamentally changed their ideas of the family. In 1988, the Inter-Censal Demographic and Health Survey found that parents wanted an average of 3.3 children, and in 1994, they found that the ideal number of children fell to 2.8.\n\nHowever, the reported findings differ depending on the fertility model utilized and on the particular research study cited. The United Nations Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific found that the average number in household was 3.1 in 1998. In another study conducted by the America-based non-profit, non-governmental organization Population Reference Bureau, the number found was lower at 2.3. Another study, published in the Worldwide State of the Family in 1995 by Tran Xuan Nhi, found a contrasting finding that the total fertility rate only dropped slightly and the size of nuclear families experienced only a slight change, dipping from 4.8 to 4.7 from 1989 to 1994.\n\nThere is evidence that son preference exists in Vietnam. Traditionally, men oversee and are responsible for household enterprises, managing agriculture, ancestral worship, and carrying on the family name. However, although the desire for a son is seen in the Vietnamese family's fertility practices, the desire for more than one son is not. Families with two daughters are twice as likely to have a third child than families with at least one son, presumably with the hopes that this one will be a boy. Furthermore, women who do not have any sons are around 15% less likely to use contraceptives than families who have at least one. There were also increased rates of \"contraceptive failure\" amongst couples who had a son, as families secretly removed an IUD to bypass the policy in hopes of having a son. This is consistent with findings from other East Asian countries in which son preference corresponds with a demand for fewer children so that families will have at least one son to maintain the ancestral line.\n\nDespite the evidence for son preference, there is no clear evidence that Vietnam's sex ratio at birth is increasing, as seen in other East Asian countries, notably China, though evidence is conflicting depending on the source. In fact, according to the Vietnamese census data for 1989 and 1999, the sex ratios of males to females at birth are actually decreasing. On the other hand, some sources state that the impact of son preference varies by region of Vietnam. In the north, there is a strong relationship between sex bias in fertility decisions and number of male births, while in the south, this relationship is nonexistent. However, mothers who pursue certain occupations, such as government cadres and farmers, are more likely to want a particular sex of child and have higher sex-ratio differences at birth. This reflects the pressure for government employees to adhere to the two-child limit, and the perceived necessity of males for manual labor in the farm.\n\nAlthough the policy states that \"the state will supply, free of charge, birth control devices... to eligible persons who are cadres, manual workers, civil servants or members of the armed forces... and poor persons who register to practice family planning... The widespread sale of birth control devices will be permitted to facilitate their use by everybody that needs them,\" the only modern contraceptive readily available in Vietnam is the IUD. However, many women choose not to use it due to the side effects, such as increased bleeding, back and abdominal pains, headache, and general weakness. Thus, contraceptive use is low among women under the age of 25, and experts have speculated that \"contraceptive use among young women might increase if temporary, easy-to-use methods, such as the pill and the condom, were more accessible. For the government to achieve its two-child policy, the survey committee recommends increased promotion of the commercial availability of the condom and the pill, and strengthening of the government family planning program.\"\n\nAbortion rates in Vietnam are unusually high by international standards, with a total abortion rate of at least 2.5 abortions per woman. Generally, the abortion rate for young age groups is higher than older age groups due to a limited awareness of contraceptive methods and availability. Individuals of lower educational levels also have higher abortion rates. Vietnam also has some of the world's most liberal abortion laws, though the Vietnamese government is aiming to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortion-related difficulties. Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son.\n\nThere are multiple factors influencing Vietnam's high abortion rates. First, because women do not have access to contraceptive methods besides IUDs, whilst condoms remain expensive relative to average income, as a result many do not use effective birth control. Women who have undergone multiple abortions used short-term methods of contraceptives, such as condoms and contraceptive pills, which are less effective than long-acting contraceptives to which many do not have access. Secondly, due to the higher costs of raising a child in some geographic areas of Vietnam, abortions have become more acceptable. Furthermore, the era of modernization and development of free-market reforms since the 1980s has led to a rise in premarital and unwanted pregnancy, and subsequently increased abortion services. Additionally, the Vietnamese government has insufficient alternatives to abortion within the family planning purposes and a lack of post-abortion contraceptive dialogues for families. Thus, experts have suggested providing more diverse, long-acting contraceptive alternatives and increasing counseling for families that have experienced an abortion as methods to decrease abortion in Vietnam.\n\n"}

{"id": "56419774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56419774", "title": "Whisper network", "text": "Whisper network\n\nA whisper network describes a chain of information privately passed between people, typically a list of powerful people in an industry alleged as being sexual harassers or abusers. The information is often shared between women by word of mouth, online in private communities, in forums, via spreadsheets, and sometimes using crowd-sourced documents. The stated purpose of maintaining these lists is to warn potential victims of \"people to avoid\" in their industry. Whisper networks also purportedly help victims realize they are not alone so they can find each other and come forward together about a serial abuser. The term \"whisper network\" was newly popularized during the #MeToo movement after several private lists were published outside private networks, for example the Shitty Media Men list, the California State Capitol list, and the Harvey Weinstein Google doc. Karen Kelsky created a less controversial list called \"Sexual Harassment In the Academy: A Crowdsourced Survey\" which had grown to over 2000 entries by the end of 2017, and includes stories without actually naming the accusing and accused parties. Kelsky said she hoped the list would help demonstrate the scope of sexual misconduct in the academic field, and it has resulted in the investigation of twelve men at the University of Michigan.\n\nPublishing whisper networks to the public has been widely criticized for spreading unsubstantiated rumors which can damage reputations, though there continues to be debate on the best alternatives to anonymous sharing for women who have been punished or ignored by official channels yet would still like to warn other women. It has been noted that certain vulnerable groups rarely get access to these private lists, for example women who are young and women of color. As a result, these groups rarely receive any protection from whisper networks unless they are published. The main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations. Some suggestions have included strengthening unions in vulnerable industries so workers can report directly to the union, maintaining industry hotlines which have the power to trigger third-party investigations, and creating public systems that allow anonymous reporting with the ability to connect victims who report the same perpetrator. Several apps have been developed which offer various ways for women to report sexual misconduct, and some of these apps have the ability to connect victims with each other. Sex workers regularly share “bad date lists” and St. James Infirmary Clinic (which offers health and safety services for sex workers), created a “Bad Date” app that allows sex workers to anonymously log incidents with clients who have threatened, extorted, robbed, or been violent, potentially warning other sex workers in the future.\n"}
