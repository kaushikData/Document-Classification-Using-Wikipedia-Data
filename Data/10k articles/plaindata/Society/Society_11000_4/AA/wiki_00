Propaganda of the deed, or \"attentát\", was espoused by leading anarchists in the late nineteenth century, and was associated with a number of incidents of violence. Anarchist thought, however, is quite diverse on the question of violence. In the name of coherence some anarchists have opposed coercion, while others have supported it, particularly in the form of violent revolution on the path to anarchy. Anarchism includes a school of thought which rejects all violence (anarcho-pacifism).\n\nMany anarchists regard the state to be at the definitional center of structural violence: directly or indirectly preventing people from meeting their basic needs, calling for violence as self-defense.\n\nPerhaps the first anarchist periodical was named \"The Peaceful Revolutionist\", a strain of anarchism that followed Tolstoy's pacifism.\n\nLate in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of general strike. This often resulted in violence by both sides and some of the strikes even resulted in the deaths of striking workers, their replacements and security staff.\n\nIn this climate, some anarchists began to advocate and practice of terrorism or assassination, which they referred to as propaganda of the deed. In many cases, newspapers blamed anarchist terrorism on immigrant naïvete, but scholar Richard Bach Jensen explained that \"the emigrant experience may have heightened a pre-existing radicalism or given more precise configuration to its violent expression.\"\n\nAnarcho-pacifism (also pacifist anarchism or anarchist pacifism) is a form of anarchism which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. Important proponents include Leo Tolstoy and Bart de Ligt. Mohandas Gandhi is an important influence.\n\nHenry David Thoreau, though not a pacifist himself, influenced both Leo Tolstoy and Mohandas Gandhi's advocacy of Nonviolent resistance through his work \"Civil Disobedience\".\n\nAt some point anarcho-pacifism had as its main proponent Christian anarchism. The first large-scale anarcho-pacifist movement was the Tolstoyan peasant movement in Russia. They were a predominantly peasant movement that set up hundreds of voluntary anarchist pacifist communes based on their interpretation of Christianity as requiring absolute pacifism and the rejection of all coercive authority.\n\n\"Dutch anarchist-pacifist Bart de Ligt’s 1936 treatise \"The Conquest of Violence\" (with its none too subtle allusion to Kropotkin’s \"The Conquest of Bread\") was also of signal importance.\" \"Gandhi's ideas were popularized in the West in books such as Richard Gregg's \"The Power of Nonviolence\" (1935), and Bart de Ligt's \"The Conquest of Violence\" (1937).\nPeter Gelderloos criticizes the idea that nonviolence is the only way to fight for a better world. According to Gelderloos, pacifism as an ideology serves the interests of the state.\n\nAnarchism encompasses a variety of views about violence. The Tolstoyan tradition of non-violent resistance is prevalent among some anarchists. Ursula K. Le Guin's novel \"The Dispossessed\", a fictional novel about a society that practices \"Odonianism\", expressed this anarchism:\n\nOdonianism is anarchism. Not the bomb-in-the-pocket stuff, which is terrorism, whatever name it tries to dignify itself with, not the social-Darwinist economic 'libertarianism' of the far right; but anarchism, as prefigured in early Taoist thought, and expounded by Shelley and Kropotkin, Goldman and Goodman. Anarchism's principal target is the authoritarian State (capitalist or socialist); its principle moral-practical theme is cooperation (solidarity, mutual aid). It is the most idealistic, and to me the most interesting, of all political theories.\n\nEmma Goldman included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination in her early career, but changed her views after she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the Red Army. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocated violence only as a means of self-defense.\n\nSome anarchists see violent revolution as necessary in the abolition of capitalist society, while others advocate non-violent methods. \nErrico Malatesta, an anarcho-communist, propounded that it is \"necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies [the means of life and for development] to the workers.\" As he put it in \"Umanità Nova\" (no. 125, September 6, 1921):\n\nAnarchists with this view advocate violence insofar as they see it to be necessary in ridding the world of exploitation, and especially states.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon argued in favor of a non-violent revolution through a process of dual power in which libertarian socialist institutions would be established and form associations enabling the formation of an expanding network within the existing state-capitalist framework with the intention of eventually rendering both the state and the capitalist economy obsolete. The progression towards violence in anarchism stemmed, in part, from the massacres of some of the communes inspired by the ideas of Proudhon and others. Many anarcho-communists began to see a need for revolutionary violence to counteract the violence inherent in both capitalism and government.\n\nAnarcho-pacifism is a tendency within the anarchist movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change. The main early influences were the thought of Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy. It developed \"mostly in , Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War\". Opposition to the use of violence has not prohibited anarcho-pacifists from accepting the principle of resistance or even revolutionary action provided it does not result in violence; it was in fact their approval of such forms of opposition to power that lead many anarcho-pacifists to endorse the anarcho-syndicalist concept of the general strike as the great revolutionary weapon. Later anarcho-pacifists have also come to endorse the non-violent strategy of dual power.\n\nOther anarchists have believed that violence (especially self-defense) is justified as a way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.\n\n"}

He later received his M.P.A. from Harvard University in 2002.\n\nBraga worked as a research associate at Rutgers University's Center for Crime Prevention Studies from 1993 to 1995. He then began working at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government as a research associate, where he has been a senior research fellow since July 2010. Also in July 2010, he joined Rutgers again as a professor of criminal justice, and became the Don M. Gottfredson Professor of Evidence-Based Criminology there in September 2012. On July 1, 2016, he left Rutgers and Harvard to become the director of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University.\n\nBraga's research focuses on multiple topics in the field of criminology, including reducing criminals' access to guns, reducing gang-relatead violence, and crime control hot spots. He has also designed a study on the effectiveness of police body-worn cameras. He has recommended that, to conduct this study, the New York Police Department put such cameras on some of its officers in 20 precincts and compare these officers to their counterparts in precincts where officers are not wearing cameras. His research has also found that hot-spot policing is effective at reducing the crime rate. In the 1990s, while a research associate at Harvard, he and his colleagues designed and implemented the anti-gang violence program Operation Ceasefire in Boston. He has since published research showing that this program was associated with reductions in violence, but that this relationship may not be causal.\n\nBraga's work with the Boston Police Department on its Safe Street Teams program led to him receiving the International Association of Chiefs of Police's Community Policing Award and Excellence in Law Enforcement Research Award, both in 2011.

According to the 2010 census, there were 5,267 registered Chilean citizens living in Mexico, an increase from the 3,848 registered in the 2000 census. Chilean immigrants constitute the fifth largest community of South Americans in Mexico (after Colombian Mexicans, Argentine Mexicans, Venezuelan Mexicans and Peruvian Mexicans) and the fifteenth largest immigrant community overall.\n\nThe first South Americans who came to an independent Mexico came from Chile and Peru, who passed through the ports of Acapulco and Puerto Ángel for supplies during the height of the gold rush in California in the mid-nineteenth century. Some Chilean and Peruvian migrants stayed and threw culturares roots among the coastal populations of the Mexican south Pacific.\n\nIn the summer of 1849, hundreds of Chileans were deceived by American filibusters to have alliances to invade the port of Guaymas, in an attempt to found the Republic of Sonora. The Chileans were taken to the camps, but the Mexican army attacked Chilean vessels and killed many immigrants accused of supporting separatists.\n\nAfter the coup that overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973, many Chileans fled the political persecution of the dictatorship of Pinochet, seeking political asylum in Mexico, accompanied by Uruguayans, Argentines and Peruvians fleeing persecution carried out by their respective governments. The higher educational level of Mexico provided a platform to protect their stay in the country. \n\nMany Chileans who sought political asylum, have settled permanently in the country. They have found the same life expectancy at best to proceed with businesses and jobs that have allowed them to maintain a standard of living much better than other Hispanic American immigrants. Both countries share the Spanish language; their historical origins are common (part of the Spanish Empire). The warmth of the people of the country has allowed them to live peacefully and in total harmony, some marrying and having families of success. There are others who are simply charmed with everything about Mexico and decided to settle in definitively. Without a doubt this is a unique example of coexistence between migrants and local.\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the cultural contributions of Chile on Mexican soil is the Chilean folk, artistic and innovative tradition of the South American sailor expressed and taught in many Guerrero and Oaxaca spaces strongly influenced by this community who arrived during and after independence from Spain. \n\nBoth countries celebrate their respective anniversaries of independence during the same month, being an important link between the two nations.\n\nAlthough both countries have different mining industries, they have developed to a level that allows it to be profitable and competitive in foreign markets. \n\nToday, the Chilean community in Mexico is one of the largest communities of foreigners in Mexico. The presence of Chileans stands mainly in large urban centers as sportsmen, academics, researchers, students, entrepreneurs and artists. \n\nIt may be mentioned also that in the technology and transport field, both countries share in their capital a metro system in common which was installed by a French consortium as the Santiago Metro and Mexico City Metro have a system trains with rubber tires, both of Alstom technology. In the 80s, when an attack took place in Santiago, the FPMR Concarril I built for Chile a NS88 train of five cars to replace the wrecked train. Both state-owned transport companies share knowledge and strategies to optimize their respective systems. Even CAF, who was winner of a bid in Santiago, designed the NS2007 Train with similarities to the NM02 Mexicano.\n\nSource: Estadísticas históricas de México 2009 and Censo de Población y Vivienda 2010\n\n\n"}

This method may have been developed to bridge the many varieties of Chinese—for example, the numbers 4 () and 10 () are hard to distinguish in some dialects. Some suggest that it was also used by business people during bargaining (i.e., to convey a bid by feeling the hand gesture in a sleeve) when they wish for more privacy in a public place. These gestures are fully integrated into Chinese Sign Language.\n\nWhile the five digits on one hand can easily express the numbers one through five, six through ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication. The gestures are rough representations of the Chinese numeral characters they represent. The system varies in practice, especially for the representation of \"7\" to \"10\". Two of the systems are listed below:\n\n\nUse of the signs corresponds to the use of numbers in the Chinese language. For instance, the sign for five just as easily means fifty. A two followed by a six, using a single hand only, could mean 260 or 2600 etc. besides twenty-six. These signs also commonly refer to days of the week, starting from Monday, as well as months of the year, whose names in Chinese are enumerations.\n\nIn different regions signs for numbers vary significantly. One may interpret the \"8\" sign as a \"7\". The \"index finger-hook\" symbol for 9, also means \"death\" in other contexts.\n\nThe numbers zero through five are simpler:\n\n\nCounting with fingers is often different from expressing a specific number with a finger gesture. When counting, the palm can be either facing its owner or the audience, depending on the purpose. Before counting, all fingers are closed; counting starts by extending the thumb as \"the first\", then the index finger as \"the second\", till all fingers are extended as \"the fifth\"; then counting can be continued by folding fingers with the same sequence, from thumb through the little finger, for counting from \"the sixth\" through \"the tenth\". Repeating the same method for counting larger numbers. One can also starts counting with all fingers extended. Some believe that for formal scenario such as giving speech or presentation, counting with the palm facing the audience and starting with all fingers extended is more polite, since the gesture of folding of fingers representing bowing.\n\nWhen playing \"drinking finger games\" (划拳, 猜拳), slightly different sets of finger gestures of numbers is used. One of them is:\n\n\nThe gesture of the digit 0 is used for showing numbers like 20, 30, 40, etc, where the left hand shows the tens digit and the right hand shows the digit 0.\n\n"}
{"id": "174395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174395", "title": "Clinton–Lewinsky scandal", "text": "Clinton–Lewinsky scandal\n\nThe Clinton–Lewinsky scandal was an American political sex scandal that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1997 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech in late January 1998 with the statement that he \"did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky\". Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.\n\nLewinsky was a graduate of Lewis & Clark College. She was hired during Clinton's first term in 1995 as an intern at the White House and was later an employee of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Some believe that Clinton began a personal relationship with her while she worked at the White House, the details of which she later confided to Linda Tripp, her Defense Department co-worker who secretly recorded their telephone conversations.\n\nIn January 1998, Tripp discovered that Lewinsky had sworn an affidavit in the Paula Jones case, denying a relationship with Clinton. She delivered tapes to Kenneth Starr, the Independent Counsel who was investigating Clinton on other matters, including the Whitewater scandal, the White House FBI files controversy, and the White House travel office controversy. During the grand jury testimony, Clinton's responses were carefully worded, and he argued, \"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is,\" with regard to the truthfulness of his statement that \"there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship.\"\n\nThe wide reporting of the scandal led to criticism of the press for over-coverage. The scandal is sometimes referred to as \"Monicagate,\" \"Lewinskygate,\" \"Tailgate,\" \"Sexgate,\" and \"Zippergate,\" following the \"-gate\" nickname construction that has been popular since the Watergate scandal.\n\nThe improper relationship between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was confirmed, but Clinton's marriage with Hillary Clinton survived the infidelity.\n\nLewinsky stated that she had sexual encounters with Bill Clinton on nine occasions from November 1995 to March 1997. According to her published schedule, First Lady Hillary Clinton was at the White House for at least some portion of seven of those days.\n\nIn April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors relocated her job to the Pentagon, because they felt that she was spending too much time around Clinton. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. \"The American Spectator\" alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.\n\nLewinsky confided in Linda Tripp about her relationship with Clinton. Tripp persuaded Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her, and not to dry clean a semen-stained blue dress. Tripp reported their conversations to literary agent Lucianne Goldberg, who advised her to secretly record them, which Tripp began doing in September 1997. Goldberg also urged Tripp to take the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and bring them to the attention of people working on the Paula Jones case. In the fall of 1997, Goldberg began speaking to reporters (including Michael Isikoff of \"Newsweek\") about the tapes.\n\nIn the Paula Jones case, Lewinsky had submitted an affidavit that denied any physical relationship with Clinton. In January 1998, she attempted to persuade Tripp to commit perjury in the Jones case. Instead, Tripp gave the tapes to Starr, who was investigating the Whitewater controversy and other matters. Starr was now armed with evidence of Lewinsky's admission of a physical relationship with Clinton, and he broadened the investigation to include Lewinsky and her possible perjury in the Jones case.\n\nNews of the scandal first broke on January 17, 1998, on the \"Drudge Report\", which reported that \"Newsweek\" editors were sitting on a story by investigative reporter Michael Isikoff exposing the affair. The story broke in the mainstream press on January 21 in \"The Washington Post\". The story swirled for several days and, despite swift denials from Clinton, the clamor for answers from the White House grew louder. On January 26, President Clinton, standing with his wife, spoke at a White House press conference, and issued a forceful denial in which he said:\n\nPundits debated whether Clinton would address the allegations in his State of the Union Address. Ultimately, he chose not to mention them. Hillary Clinton remained supportive of her husband throughout the scandal. On January 27, in an appearance on NBC's \"Today\" she said, \"The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.\"\n\nFor the next several months and through the summer, the media debated whether an affair had occurred and whether Clinton had lied or obstructed justice, but nothing could be definitively established beyond the taped recordings because Lewinsky was unwilling to discuss the affair or testify about it. On July 28, 1998, a substantial delay after the public break of the scandal, Lewinsky received transactional immunity in exchange for grand jury testimony concerning her relationship with Clinton. She also turned over a semen-stained blue dress (that Linda Tripp had encouraged her to save without dry cleaning) to the Starr investigators, thereby providing unambiguous DNA evidence that could prove the relationship despite Clinton's official denials.\n\nClinton admitted in taped grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, that he had engaged in an \"improper physical relationship\" with Lewinsky. That evening he gave a nationally televised statement admitting that his relationship with Lewinsky was \"not appropriate\".\n\nOn August 20, 1998, three days after Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Operation Infinite Reach launched missiles against al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan. Some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie \"Wag the Dog\", which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.\n\nIn his deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky. Based on the evidence—a blue dress with Clinton's semen that Tripp provided—Starr concluded that the president's sworn testimony was false and perjurious.\n\nDuring the deposition, Clinton was asked \"Have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1?\" The judge ordered that Clinton be given an opportunity to review the agreed definition. Afterwards, based on the definition created by the Independent Counsel's Office, Clinton answered, \"I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.\" Clinton later stated, \"I thought the definition included any activity by [me], where [I] was the actor and came in contact with those parts of the bodies\" which had been explicitly listed (and \"with an intent to gratify or arouse the sexual desire of any person\"). In other words, Clinton denied that \"he\" had ever contacted \"Lewinsky's\" \"genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks\", and effectively claimed that the agreed-upon definition of \"sexual relations\" included \"giving\" oral sex but excluded \"receiving\" oral sex.\n\nTwo months after the Senate failed to convict him, President Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony regarding his sexual relationship with Lewinsky, and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. Clinton declined to appeal the civil contempt of court ruling, citing financial problems, but still maintained that his testimony complied with Wright's earlier definition of sexual relations. In 2001, his license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years and later by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn December 1998, Clinton's Democratic political party was in the minority in both chambers of Congress. A few Democratic members of Congress, and most in the opposition Republican Party, claimed that Clinton's giving false testimony and allegedly influencing Lewinsky's testimony were crimes of obstruction of justice and perjury and thus impeachable offenses. The House of Representatives voted to issue Articles of Impeachment against him which was followed by a 21-day trial in the Senate.\n\nAll of the Democrats in the Senate voted for acquittal on both the perjury and the obstruction of justice charges. Ten Republicans voted for acquittal for perjury: John Chafee (Rhode Island), Susan Collins (Maine), Slade Gorton (Washington), Jim Jeffords (Vermont), Richard Shelby (Alabama), Olympia Snowe (Maine), Arlen Specter (Pennsylvania), Ted Stevens (Alaska), Fred Thompson (Tennessee), and John Warner (Virginia). Five Republicans voted for acquittal for obstruction of justice: Chafee, Collins, Jeffords, Snowe, and Specter.\n\nPresident Clinton was thereby acquitted of all charges and remained in office. There were attempts to censure the president by the House of Representatives, but those attempts failed.\n\nThe scandal arguably affected the 2000 U.S. presidential election in two contradictory ways. Democratic Party candidate and sitting vice president Al Gore said that Clinton's scandal had been \"a drag\" that deflated the enthusiasm of their party's base, and had the effect of reducing Democratic votes. Clinton said that the scandal had made Gore's campaign too cautious, and that if Clinton had been allowed to campaign for Gore in Arkansas and New Hampshire, either state would have delivered Gore's needed electoral votes regardless of the effects of the Florida recount controversy.\n\nPolitical analysts have supported both views. Before and after the 2000 election, John Cochran of \"ABC News\" connected the Lewinsky scandal with a voter phenomenon he called \"Clinton fatigue\". Polling showed that the scandal continued to affect Clinton's low \"personal approval\" ratings through the election, and analysts such as Vanderbilt University's John G. Geer later concluded \"Clinton fatigue or a kind of moral retrospective voting had a significant impact on Gore's chances\". Other analysts sided with Clinton's argument, and argued that Gore's refusal to have Clinton campaign with him damaged his appeal.\n\nDuring the scandal, supporters of former President Clinton alleged that the matter should remain private, and called some supporting Clinton's impeachment hypocritical. For example, during the House investigation, it was revealed that Henry Hyde, Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee and lead House manager, also had an affair while in office as a state legislator. Hyde, aged 70 during the Lewinsky hearings, dismissed it as a \"youthful indiscretion\" (he had been 41).\n\nA highly publicized investigation campaign actively sought information that might embarrass politicians who supported impeachment. According to the British newspaper \"The Guardian\",\n\nRepublican congressman Bob Livingston had been widely expected to become Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in the next Congressional session. Then just weeks away after Flynt revealed the affair, Livingston resigned and challenged Clinton to do the same.\n\nFlynt's investigation also claimed that Congressman Bob Barr, another Republican House manager, had an affair while married; Barr had been the first lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation due to the Lewinsky affair. Barr lost a primary challenge less than three years after the impeachment proceedings.\n\nDan Burton, Republican Representative from Indiana, had stated \"No one, regardless of what party they serve, no one, regardless of what branch of government they serve, should be allowed to get away with these alleged sexual improprieties...\" In 1998, Burton admitted that he himself had had an affair in 1983 that produced a child.\n\nSpeaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Representative from Georgia and leader of the Republican Revolution of 1994, admitted in 1998 to having had an affair with then House Agriculture Committee staffer Callista Bisek while he was married to his second wife, at the same time as he was leading the impeachment of Bill Clinton for perjury regarding an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\nRepublican Helen Chenoweth-Hage from Idaho aggressively called for the resignation of President Clinton and admitted to her own six-year affair with a married rancher during the 1980s.\n\nHistorian Taylor Branch implied that Clinton had requested changes to Branch's 2009 Clinton biography, \"\", regarding Clinton's revelation that the Lewinsky affair began because \"I cracked; I just cracked.\" Branch writes that Clinton had felt \"beleaguered, unappreciated, and open to a liaison with Lewinsky\" following \"the Democrats' loss of Congress in the November 1994 elections, the death of his mother the previous January, and the ongoing Whitewater investigation\". Publicly, Clinton had previously blamed the affair on \"a terrible moral error\" and on anger at Republicans, stating, \"if people have unresolved anger, it makes them do non-rational, destructive things.\"\n\n\n\n"}

This embodies all art forms, the sciences, and philosophies. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture, but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect – sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with \"neo-\").\n\nThere is continual argument over the precise definition of each of these periods, and one historian might group them differently, or choose different names or descriptions. As well, even though in many cases the popular change from one to the next can be swift and sudden, the beginning and end of movements are somewhat subjective, as the movements did not spring fresh into existence out of the blue and did not come to an abrupt end and lose total support, as would be suggested by a date range. Thus use of the term \"period\" is somewhat deceptive. \"Period\" also suggests a linearity of development, whereas it has not been uncommon for two or more distinctive cultural approaches to be active at the same time. Historians will be able to find distinctive traces of a cultural movement before its accepted beginning, and there will always be new creations in old forms. So it can be more useful to think in terms of broad \"movements\" that have rough beginnings and endings. Yet for historical perspective, some rough date ranges will be provided for each to indicate the \"height\" or accepted time span of the movement.\n\nThis current article covers western, notably European and American cultural movements. They have, however, been paralleled by cultural movements in the Orient and elsewhere. In the late 20th and early 21st century in Thailand, for example, there has been a cultural shift away from western social and political values more toward Japanese and Chinese. As well, That culture has reinvigorated monarchical concepts to accommodate state shifts away from western ideology regarding democracy and monarchies. \n\n\n\n\n"}

As an Islamic society that follows the Qur'an and the Sunnah, disability is often seen through the lens of religion. Islam teaches that people with disabilities are to be treated with respect and equality. However, Saudi Arabia tends to view disability through the medical model, rather than the social model. In addition, there are few studies relating to people with disabilities in Saudi Arabia compared to other countries.\n\nFor many years, it was thought that the rate of disability in Saudi Arabia was low, but it turned out that many families were not integrating people with disabilities into daily life. A 2000 census found that 135,000 Saudi Arabian people have disabilities, with 33.7% of these being physical disabilities. More people with disabilities live in rural areas.\n\nIn 2010, statistics showed the leading cause of disability in Saudi Arabia for men was traffic injuries on the highway, while for women, the leading cause was major depressive disorder. The prevalence of depression in women is between 17 and 46 percent and early diagnosis is critical to both patient outcome and cost of treatment. Younger women are also more likely to intentionally attempt suicide.\n\nAnother major cause of disability is close family intermarriage. First cousins marrying in Saudi Arabia is common. There is also a higher risk of congenital disability among parents who are disabled, older mothers and mothers who do not have adequate health care during pregnancy.\n\nIn Islamic society, there is an emphasis in respecting the lives of people with disabilities. In general, Islam is against all kinds of discrimination, including discrimination against disability. In society, people with disabilities are often marginalized for various reasons, including lack of education about disabilities in communities and shame for having disability and the poverty that often accompanies disability. Parents of children with disabilities such as autism, often get information about their children's condition from non-medical sources, believing vaccinations or the evil eye caused the autism. Some parents turn to religion to help their children improve. \n\nAmong health care professionals, there is an overall positive attitude towards people with disabilities, regardless of gender. It was found that doctors often did not give adequate health information to patients who have Down syndrome. It is still common for people who can afford it to receive medical treatment for disabilities in Western countries.\n\nIt is politically correct to refer to people with disabilities as \"people with special needs.\" \n\nSaudi Arabia bases its laws on Islamic Sharia. Islamic Sharia puts an emphasis on people with disabilities to have the rights \"to live with dignity and benefit from welfare.\" The Royal Family of Saudi Arabia is supportive of both private and public endeavors to help people with disabilities.\n\nThe Ministry of Education runs several organizations to help people with disabilities. These include the Noor Institute for the Blind, the Amal Institute for the Deaf and the Institute for the Intellectually Disabled. Other organizations are run by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The Ministry of Health provides health services to most people in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPeople with disabilities in Saudi Arabia are entitled to 50% off airfare for themselves and a companion. They have the right to education, equal work and access to public space. People with disabilities are entitled to handicapped parking spaces and a subsidy of SR 10,000 to convert cars for specifications relating to their disability. Social security is available to individuals with disabilities or who become disabled later in life.\n\nThe King Salman Centre for Disability Research, Disabled Children Association and the Joint Centre for Research in Prosthetics and Orthotics and Rehabilitation Programs are three non-governmental organizations operating in Saudi Arabia to help people with disabilities.\n\nThe first law to protect people with disabilities in Saudi Arabia was created in 1956 with Royal Decree No. 1219. This decree also directs government organizations to coordinate with non-governmental organizations so that services aren't duplicated. It is also concurrent with a major outbreak of polio in the country. In 1969, the labor code was established to define vocational rehabilitation for people with disabilities. The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 407 in 1973 provided a monthly allowance for people with disabilities who \"participate at Disabled Training Centers.\" The next year, the Council of Ministers passed Resolution No. 715 which provided services for various people with disabilities who require medical care. The Decree No. 129 created policy for the General Department of Rehabilitation and created vocational and rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities. \n\nIn 1980, under the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 219 allows the General Department of Rehabilitation is to give an annual donation of SR 30,000 to projects for people with disabilities which were created by people with disabilities themselves. The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 187 in 1981 allowed people with disabilities and organizations they run to reprieve a 50% discount on government-owned transportation. In 1987, Legislation of Disability was created. In 1992, the Basic System, Issue No. A/90, article 27 ensures that citizens' rights are upheld in \"cases of emergency, disability, or old age by providing social security.\" In 1997, the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 85 created the Person with Disabilities Services Coordination Committee. The resolution also created plans to raise awareness of disabilities and provided donations to families of people with disabilities. The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 7 of 1999 provides approval to raise donations up to SR 50,000 for rehabilitation programs developed by people with disabilities for training goals.\n\nLater, the Disability Code of 2000 was created. The disability code emphasizes the civil rights of people with disabilities to equally access free and \"appropriate medical, psychological, social, educational, and rehabilitation services through public agencies.\" The only provision of Saudi Arabian law that deal with accessibility is the Saudi Building Code (SBC) of 2007, which states that all buildings must be accessible, but doesn't provide exact determinations of what this needs to entail.\n\nCriticism of legislation for people with disabilities is that since it is most often based on the medical model of disability, it rarely deals with the social consequences that people with disability face in Saudi Arabia. Not dealing with the social aspects of disability means that there is not enough emphasis on integrating people into society. For example, despite the passage of SBC, many people who use wheelchairs face difficultly accessing public spaces in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe first special education services were provided for blind students who received education in \"scientific institutes\" in 1958. Prior to 1958, parents were expected to provide assistance to their children with disabilities. Official special education in Saudi Arabia was created in 1962, when the Ministry of Education established the Department of Special Learning. Like most schools in Saudi Arabia, special education classes are also gender segregated and teach Islamic principals. A study published in 2016 looked at parent's satisfaction with special education for daughters with learning disabilities. The results were that the parents were generally satisfied with intervention and referral services, and with classroom services for their daughters. Special education is meant to take place in the least restrictive environment (LRE) and all students have an Individual Educational Program (IEP).\n\nAccessibility to buildings for those with physical disabilities in Saudi Arabia is lacking. In addition, there are more services and organizations for people with disabilities in urban areas.\n\nSaudi Arabia offers limited mental health services.\n\nProsthetics must be engineered to help people be able to attend and perform the Muslim Call to Prayer.\n\nWomen in Saudi Arabia often must use women-only clinics which are often not accessible for individuals with physical disabilities. Women's restrictions in Saudi Arabia limit their ability to access mental health services. Girls with disabilities have often been hidden at home so that people are not afraid to marry into their family.\n\nThe first paralympic team sent by Saudi Arabia was in 1996, and they competed in Atlanta. Para-athletes have also been involved in the INAS World Football Championship.\n\n"}
{"id": "19282291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19282291", "title": "Dogs in Mesoamerica", "text": "Dogs in Mesoamerica\n\nVarious sorts of dogs are known to have existed in prehispanic In Mesoamerica, as shown by archaeological and iconographical sources, and the testimonies of the 16th-century Spaniards. In the Central Mexican area, there were three races: the medium-sized furred dog (\"itzcuintli\"), the medium-sized hairless dog (\"xoloitzcuintli\"), and the short-legged, (\"tlalchichi\") based in Colima and now extinct. Apart from other, more obvious functions, dogs were also used for food (10% of all consumed meat in Teotihuacan) and ritual sacrifice.\nThe ancient Mayans, a group of people who lived throughout southern Mexico and Central America, used domesticated dogs on a daily basis as a food source, hunting aide, and an element in religious and spiritual rituals.\n\nRemains of dogs have been found in sites dating from the Preclassic through the Postclassic periods of Mesoamerica dating as early as 1200 BCE. These remains have appeared in middens, spread over yard surfaces, and near areas of sacrificial offerings. Since the deposits of dogs were discovered along with other plant and animal remains, it is difficult to decipher dog parts from those of other small mammals. In Colha, Belize, dog foot bones and teeth were found more than any other body part.\n\nDespite the fact that the amount of dog use varied throughout time and place, people of the coastal regions of the Maya area placed more importance on dogs due to their constant availability as a source of protein and their ability to rapidly reproduce. Breeding and raising domesticated dogs required low energy use. Fish and other hunted animals were not as reliable as dogs as a food resource, and it required more energy and time to capture these animals for consumption. Overall, it is because of the comparison of dog deposits to other fauna and how the amount of dog deposits differs among sites from various periods. Because of this variation, it is not certain if the function of dogs altered from a food source to that of a religious symbol over time. Besides becoming a meal, dogs were also used as hunting and traveling companions and were scavengers in the home.\n\nDuring a portion of the Preclassic and Early Classic period (1200 BCE through 250 CE), dogs in Cuello, Belize were bred and killed once they reached one year of age. Dog bones had completed epiphyseal fusion and did not indicate the normal pattern of wear like adult dogs who lived longer than a year. Puppy remains were not found. Dogs were castrated and fed maize until they were fat enough to be ready for slaughter. Throughout the Preclassic period in the Yucatán region, dogs were not the primary meat supply, but archaeological evidence indicates they were a substantial part of the Maya diet. In fact, at the Colha site, white-tailed deer accounted for up to fifty percent of the Maya meat source. Starting in the Preclassic period, Maya elites served dogs during competitive feasts. They were either stewed or were burned in a sacrificial ceremony. Bones were chopped, broken, crushed and boiled to extract the marrow inside.\n\nIn addition to eating maize, dogs ate household scraps. There is no evidence for any kind of specialized diet for dogs. Today, the Yucatec Maya continue to talk about their dog-eating ancestors and carry on the tradition of feeding dogs maize by giving them six to eight tortillas daily.\n\nContemporary Maya have nine words for \"dog\" in their lexicon, not all of which correspond to separate breeds. It was documented in the sixteenth century by Spanish explorers in Mérida, Yucatán that dogs were bred locally in pens, fed maize, and sold at market. Another type of dog recognized by Maya was the hairless xoloitzcuintli, however, breeds are difficult to recognize archaeologically.\n\nIn the \"Popol Vuh\", the K'iche' Maya creation story, dogs played important roles in certain events. For example, the second attempt at creating humans turned disastrous when the gods made them out of wood. The wooden humans were emotionless and would not feed the dogs. In retaliation, the dogs became angry and destroyed them. The moral of the story is “civilized” Maya make certain that dogs are fed on a decent human diet such as maize. When dogs were used in ritual sacrifices, the act contained a dual meaning: a person gave respect to the dog by feeding it maize, which represent humans. Humans were made of maize by the gods in the Popol Vuh. Another account in the Popol Vuh describes the Hero twins sacrificing a dog that belonged to the Lords of the Underworld, also known as Xibalba. After the dog was dead, the Hero Twins brought it back to life. The Lords were so impressed that they asked the twins to sacrifice and resurrect them. In the end, the Hero Twins sacrificed the Lords of Xibalba and did not follow through on bringing them back to life. This made it possible for humans to live on earth. The story linked dogs with renewal and human life. Dogs are associated with death and have the job of leading people into the Underworld. They represent fire and are protectors of the hearth, two components of Maya life.\n\nThere are multiple situations in which dogs were used for sacrifice or burial. Dog sacrifices were important in the political sphere for rituals concerning “...inaugurations and founding of new civic religious centres...” There has also been confirmation of dog burials in Cozumel used in circumstances involving administration. Dogs were associated with “new beginnings\" and were sacrificed instead of humans on the New Year ceremony. Dogs with spots that looked like the color of cacao were sacrificed during cacao rituals because they represented economic significance. Landmarks linked to fertility and ancestor worship contain dog burials. Dogs were found buried alongside humans in graves as well as in royal residences, presumably to guide their owners to the afterlife.\n\nIn Maya art, dogs are represented in various roles and media. They have been depicted in scenes such as those from the Popol Vuh or burial processions. The Maya Vase Database exhibits a great example of a possible funeral procession on a painted vase, K5534. The dog standing below the head noble’s palanquin may be guiding its owner to Xibalba. In picture K555, another vase painting shows a scene from the Popol Vuh with Dog asking Itzamná to return to Xibalba. In addition to paintings, artists created clay figurines to resemble dogs, K8235.\n\n\n"}

More often, however, it is use by proponents of a particular project to speculate or promote their favoured project.\n\nAn example of the former (measuring past results) would include a report in the activities surrounding the 400th Anniversary of Quebec City, which claimed that the festivities created 8,742 person-years of employment (jobs) C$438 million of value added.\n\nExamples of the latter (making claims to support a project) include the following: A 2003 presentation by the Caribbean Tourism Organization supporting the 2007 World Cup of Cricket A new public bus service promote by the Société de transport de l’Outaouais suggests that a new bus service will promote urban development and more localized consumption along the route. \n"}

{"id": "50416203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50416203", "title": "Gender-specific prison programming in the United States", "text": "Gender-specific prison programming in the United States\n\nGender-specific prison programming in the United States are programs created to prepare incarcerated women for successful reentry, and minimize recidivism. Prison programming and how it is structured has changed significantly over the decades to fit the needs of women in gender-specific programming. Focus on gender-specific programming increased during the 1970s and 1980s, an era marked by a substantial increase in the female prison population. Traditional programming in female correctional facilities have been deemed ineffective since most were structured to fit men's needs. For example, women's pathways to prison typically involve drugs, while men are typically involved in violent crimes. Additionally, women are more likely to have experiences of sexual and/or physical abuse relative to men.\n\nProgramming for imprisoned women was centered on domesticity, although efforts were made to include industrial training programs and academic programs. For example, the Indiana Women's Prison tried to incorporate chair caning, paper-boxing making, glove stitching, and laundry, which, with the exception of the latter, were deemed \"financially disappointing.\" Academic classes were difficult to maintain due to staff and funding shortages, and differences in education levels among the women. At another institution in Framingham, Massachusetts, administrators implemented an indenture system, a conditional early release program that allowed women to serve as domestic servants in nearby homes located on the country side, which proved to be rather successful with a less than nine percent recidivism rate for those who participated in the program. Domesticity was also promoted by prisoner officials. For example, in 1896, former superintendent Sarah Keely described the work offered to women as being appropriate, since it reflected work in a familial setting. The lucrative nature and accessibility of acquiring domestic skills contributed to their lack of participation in higher skills training. Despite efforts to equip female inmates with remunerative skills, programming throughout the early and mid-1900's continued to consist of limited educational and vocational opportunities. Job training programming mostly entailed training in as cleaning, sewing, cosmetology, food service, laundry, and clerical work, programs that did not lead women to meaningful and financially secure job opportunities upon release. It has been noted that use of such programs persisted since most women entered prison with little to no education or work experience.\n\nPrior to the 1980s, there was a lack of programming focused on drug treatment for incarcerated women, and even less research regarding the outcomes of treatment programs in general. Research regarding the relationship between women and substance abuse had begun only a few years earlier during the 1970s, and focused primarily on alcohol treatment services, rather than drug treatment services. Furthermore, since the female prison population was relatively small, male substance abuse treatment had set the standard. Two of the earliest research studies investigated the outcomes of Cornerstone program (Oregon, 1976), and the Stay'n Out program (New York, 1974), with the latter conducted at an all-female facility. While these programs were found to be successful, it was noted that other male-oriented programming such as urine testing and drug education courses were generally ineffective for female offenders. Only during the 1980s and 1990s did research regarding gender-specific programming for women become more prevalent.\n\nDuring the 1980s and the early 1990s, researchers began investigating how substance abuse affected women and men differently, and how women functioned in traditional treatment programs. Researchers found that the characteristics of female substance abuse differed from male substance abuse in several ways including pathways to drug use, psychosocial factors, and psychological impacts of drug use. One study conducted in California prisons found that nearly 80% of women reported some form of physical and/or sexual abuse followed by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, it was observed that in traditional drug and alcohol programs such as Alcohol Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), women had lower participation rates in all aspects including entry, retention, and completion compared to those of their male counterparts. The emphasis on gender-specific programming was further substantiated by the fact that a greater proportion of women than men were serving sentences for drug-related offenses during this period of time. In highlighting the relationship between women's drug use to other issues such as poverty, abuse, race and gender inequalities, studies acknowledged the ineffectiveness of isolated, treatment options. As a result of this research, several designs for an effective gender-specific program were identified. Some of most common characteristics included female-only environments, promotion of female empowerment, skill building, mutual exchange, and relational orientation.\n\nOne major effort designed to achieve gender-specific substance abuse treatment include the implementation and monitoring of therapeutic communities (TCs), which are characterized by the National Institute for Drug Abuse as \"drug-free residential settings that use a hierarchical model with treatment stages that reflect increased levels of personal and social responsibility\". TCs have been a national model for drug abuse treatment historically found in male facilities, but have appeared in female facilities. While male-oriented TCs tend to use authoritarian and aggressive approaches, female-oriented TCs take a more relaxed, and less confrontational approach. In both cases, TCs have been successful in reducing recidivism. For example, the Stay'n Out program was shown to reduce recidivism rates for both women and men. Furthermore, women who stayed in the program for 9 to 12 months were more likely to successfully complete their parole compared to their male counterparts. For women suffering from severe and long-term abuse, a more intense TC, residential TC, was implemented. Women in these residential programs lived together, and away from the general prison population. Despite this being most needed form of treatment for women, in 1994, most prisons lacked this type residential programming, with less than nine percent of women receiving such treatment while incarcerated.\n\nIn addition to TC programs being successful, they tend to be less expensive than the cost of incarceration. In 1993, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, an initiative developed under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), began funding mid-term and long-term residential TC programs for incarcerated women. These programs tend to last anywhere from fifty days to six months. In addition, they began funding one residential program, and two intensive intervention programs which lasted at least six months, and on average two weeks, respectively. One TC program was roughly $790,000 for 250 women, or approximately $3,200 per inmate, while the cost of incarceration ranged from $20,000 and $30,000, supporting the idea that incarceration is more expensive than treatment. In the case of CSAT-sponsored programs, the average cost of incarceration was roughly $51, while the cost of treatment was $9.22 per woman.\n\nIn the early 1990s, post-secondary educational programs were solely academic in nature, and in women's prisons, were either nonexistent, or underutilized, with less than 10 percent of female prison population enrolled in educational programming. In 1994, this number further decreased due to inmates' ineligibility for the Pell grant and other financial aid. Funding for educational programming included federal grants, private donors, as well as state financial aid, as seen in North Carolina and California.\n\nTraditionally, the most common treatment for substance abuse stems from a medical model, which views addiction disease. This model sees disease of addiction as being rooted solely in the individual. Relatively recent research suggests that addiction can be best understood holistically, as evident in the more recent programming that focus on other aspects of the individual. Currently, most female correctional facilities contain a range of evidence-based programming for substance abuse that have been shown to both reduce recidivism, and promote positive social behavior. Most of the substance abuse programs are largely funded by organizations such as CSAT. In addition to residential TCs, prison-based substance abuse programming may include detoxification units, inpatient drug treatment, outpatient treatment or counseling, self-help group/peer counseling, education/awareness, or maintenance program. Volunteering professionals across several disciplines often run these programs, since effective gender-responsive programming should address substance abuse holistically. While there has been an increase in the number of substance abuse treatment options, research regarding their effectiveness has reduced since the late 1990s. The outcome evaluations that come during the early 2000s focus primarily on programming elements that contribute to high levels of effectiveness. For example, a 2001 study of treatment investigated the effectiveness of receiving treatment (versus not receiving treatment), group type (mixed versus female only), and the type of women's treatment (enhanced vs standard).\n\nVocational training covers a wide range of occupations including trade skills such as auto mechanics, and electrical work or other occupational skills such as culinary arts, warehousing, and other hands-on work experience. Nonetheless, there tends to be far less vocational training programs in women's facilities compared to male facilities, even though women are more likely to take advantage of such programs. Vocational training programs currently provided in female correctional facilities are much like those seen throughout the 1980s and 1990s. They are gender-stereotyped and lower-skill opportunities such as sewing, clerical work, food services, and cosmetology. The use of these types of vocational programs has been described as ironic since some state legislatures prohibit ex-offenders from entering such fields. In 2003, at least six states had barred ex-offenders from public employment, prohibiting them opportunities in approximately 350 higher-skilled occupations, thus restricting women to low-paying jobs upon reentry.\n\nBy far, vocational training and work assignments have ranked highest among women's priorities. Due to limitations and high demands of these programs, enrollment is quite difficult. In some cases, the waitlists tend to be longer than the number of students. In one survey conducted in 1995, vocational was identified as a top priority, but only 14 to 28 percent of women were actually enrolled. Furthermore, the educational eligibility requirements for vocational training tend to result in underutilization of programs since some require higher levels of education. For example, a business program at a New Hampshire women's facility in the 1990s was inaccessible since most women lacked the educational requirements. Additionally, access to stable employment is often compounded by the fact that newly released women have limited access to adequate transportation and resources, which reduces the likelihood of long-term employment. The existence of vocational program is not enough to recidivism; the quality of the program, and the need for that occupation must also be taken into account. More specifically, the program must train women in widely available fields experiencing shortages, and must in an area that will provide a living wage. For example, a temporary plumbing maintenance program was implemented throughout correctional facilities in New York State during the early 2000s, a time where plumbers were of relatively high demand.\n\nOne of the strongest indicators of stable employment is education. Studies of women in state correctional facilities reveal a positive relationship between educational level and probability of employment. Furthermore, higher education has been shown to increase self-esteem. The high regard for post-secondary is not reflected in prison programming. Over 90 percent of state prisons provide educational programs that focus on GED preparation and adult basic education, but only a few prisons offer programming in post-secondary education. Furthermore, participation in educational programs is relatively lower than participation in vocational training, and work assignments. The challenge to complete coursework appears specifically when competing with participation in paid work assignments. In a comparative study of women's participation in programming, less than half, 34 percent of women participated in educational programming, while 70 percent of women had work assignments.\n\nCollege education is becoming increasingly important for advancement in the labor market. Consequently, more focus is being placed on higher education in correctional facilities. Some prisons have developed relationships with local community colleges to form postsecondary correctional education (PSCE) programs. Such programs allow individuals to take credited (or non-credited) college level courses. Through funding, these programs are offered at discounted rates, or at no cost to the inmate. The programs vary in length, eligibility requirements, eligibility, course type, and program structure.\n\n"}

Other peoples speaking related languages include the Luba of Kasai and Shaba, the Kanyok, Songye, Kaonde, Sanga, Bemba and the people of Kazembe.\nToday the Hemba people live in the north of Zambia, and their language is understood throughout Zambia. Some also live in Tanzania. They live west of Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru in the DRC, and their villages are found several hundred miles up the Lualaba River.\n\nThe Hemba people migrated eastward to the Lualaba valley from the Luba empire, probably some time after 1600.\nThey traded salt for iron hoes made in the Luba heartland, and wore raphia cloth that came by way of the Luba from the Songye people further to the west.\nAt the time of the eastward expansion of the Luba Kingdom under King Ilunga Sungu around 1800, Hemba people were living in a territory bounded by the Lukuga River in the north, the Luvua River in the south and the Lualaba River to the west.\nThe lower Lukuga and the Lualaba provided natural lines of communication, and the river valleys were densely populated.\n\nDuring Ilunga Sungu's rule the southern Hemba became tributaries to the Luba.\nThey were headed by a \"fire king\", who symbolically represented the Luba king.\nThe Hemba fire kingdom cut its links to the Luba empire after Ilunga Sungu died.\nHis successor, Kumwimbe Ngombe, had to fight several campaigns to recover the eastern territories.\nKumwimbe created a client state that united the Hemba villages of the Lukushi River valley, and that played an important role in preserving Luba dominance over other small states in the region.\nLater the Hemba regained their independence, but were subject to attacks by Arab slave traders in the later part of the nineteenth century, and then to colonization by the Belgians.\n\nThe Hemba people live in villages, recognizing chiefs as their political leaders.\nA chief will be the head of an extended family of landowners, inheriting his title through the maternal line.\nHemba people may also belong to secret societies such as the Bukazanzi for men and Bukibilo for women.\nThe So'o secret society is guarded by the beautifully carved mask of a chimpanzee, which is used in rituals that relate to the ancestral spirits.\nThese societies serve to offset the power of the chief.\n\nAlthough the Luba people failed to keep the southern Hemba in their kingdom they did have considerable cultural influence.\nArt forms, including wooden sculptures representing ancestors, are similar in style to Luba sculptures.\nThe Hemba religion recognizes a creator god and a separate supreme being.\nThe Hemba make sacrifices and present offerings at the shrines of ancestors. When social harmony has been upset, religious leaders may demand offerings to the specific ancestors that have become displeased and are causing the trouble.\nEach clan owns a \"kabeja\", a statuette with one body and two faces, male and female, on one neck.\nSacrifices are made to the \"kabeja\", which will convey them to the spirits. A receptacle on the top of the \"kabeja\" is used to receive magic incredients. A \"kabeja\" is dangerous to handle.\n\nThe villagers live by subsistence agriculture, growing manioc, maize, peanuts, and yams.\nThey also hunt and fish to a small extent to supplement their diet.\nCash is obtained through panning alluvial copper from the streams.\nMany Hemba men are also employed as miners in the copperbelt.\n\nThe Hemba artistic tradition is well known.

{"id": "39842091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39842091", "title": "Heterogeneous condition", "text": "Heterogeneous condition\n\nHeterogeneous medical condition in medicine are those medical conditions which have several etiologies, like hepatitis or diabetes. Medical conditions are normally defined pathologically (liver inflammation) or clinically (excessive urination) and not etiologically, and therefore it is normal to have more than one cause for them. The word is used as an opposition to homogeneous, meaning that given a group of patients, the disease is the same for all of them.\n\nWhen a condition is heterogeneous, it is normally divided in endotypes.\n\nAn endotype is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or pathobiological mechanism. This is distinct from a phenotype, which is any observable characteristic or trait of a disease, such as morphology, development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that patients with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.\n\nOne example is asthma, which is considered to be a syndrome, consisting of a series of endotypes. This is related to the concept of disease entity\n\nThe term medical condition is a nosological broad term that includes all diseases, disorders, injuries and syndromes, and it is specially suitable in the last case, in which it is not possible to speak about a single disease associated to the clinical course of the patient.\n\nWhile the term \"medical condition\" generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all mental disorders, uses the term \"general medical condition\" to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for mental disorders. This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some health insurance policies also define a \"medical condition\" as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses.\n\nAs it is more value-neutral than terms like \"disease\", the term \"medical condition\" is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious. It is also preferred when etiology is not unique, because the word disease is normally associated to the cause of the clinical problems. On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the autism rights movement.\n\nThe term is also used in specialized areas of the medicine. A genetic or allelic heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused, or contributed to, by varying different genes or alleles. In clinical trials and statistics the concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous populations is important. The same applies for epidemiology\n\n"}

A majority of them live in Seoul while there are smaller populations living in other parts of Korea.\n\nAccording to the 11th century legendary chronicle Samguk Yusa, Heo Hwang-ok, the consort of Suro of Geumgwan Gaya was originally a princess from a kingdom called Ayuta. In the 20th century, Kim Byung-Mo, an anthropologist from the Hanyang University, identified Ayuta with Ayodhya in India based on phonetic similarity. Heo Hwang-ok is considered an ancestor by several Korean lineages, which has led to Korean interest in Ayodhya, resulting in the construction of a Memorial of Heo Hwang-ok there.\n\nThe Indian army provided a medical unit to attend the sick and wounded in the Korean War. With the communist invasion of South Korea in 1950, the UN sent out a call to the free world for assistance. India decided not to get involved militarily but contributed a medical unit, the 60 Parachute Field Ambulance which served in Korea for a total of three and a half years (Nov 1950- May 1954), the longest single tenure by any military unit under the UN flag.\nThey were involved in providing medical cover alternately to the US Army/ROK forces and the Commonwealth Division under the UN Command as well as the local civilians, and earned a very well-deserved title, \"The Maroon Angels\". The unit also looked after the North Korean POWs. The highlight of the tenure undoubtedly was when the unit provided an ADS and a surgical team (7 officers and 5 Other ranks) during Operation Tomahawk, an airborne operation launched on 21 March 1951 by the US Army’s 187 Airborne Regimental Combat Team.\n\nTowards the end of the Korean War in 1953, a reinforced brigade known as the Custodian Force of India was deployed for the repatriation of the prisoners of war and was deployed for almost two years (1953–54).\n\nSouth Korea has been gaining popularity among Indian expatriates. Since the 1970s, many Indians have been coming to the South Korea and now there are about 7,006 Indians as per International Migration Report, living and working in the country.\n\nAccording to officials of the Indian mission in South Korea, over 1,000 engineers and software professionals have recently come to South Korea, working for large conglomerates such as LG, Hyundai and Samsung, which have today become household names back in India. There are also around 125 Indian scientists and post-doctoral research scholars working or conducting research at various institutions in the country. Indian companies are also making inroads in South Korea. The agreement between Indian and South Korea on IT will leverage the IT software capabilities of India and IT hardware capabilities of South Korea, resulting in an increased flow of IT professionals between the two countries.\n\nRecently there has been influx of many skilled IT professionals and researchers due to investment in emerging technologies by major companies. South Korean companies are now keen to employ Indian engineers from IITs and are offering them salaries that are impressive even by western standards. The companies are also extending support for free housing and food.\n\nSome of Indian associations in South Korea include \"IndiansInKorea\" (also known as IIK) with more than 5000 members (www.indiansinkorea.com), the \"Indian Association of Korea\" with mainly professionals as members, and the \"Annapurna Indian Women's Association\".\n\n\n"}

The phrase may refer to someone born in Peru of Italian descent or to someone who has immigrated to Peru from Italy. Among European Peruvians, Italians were the second largest group of immigrants to settle in the country.\n\nBetween 1532 and 1560, 50 Italians established in Lima (Viceroyalty of Peru) and Callao, mostly from Liguria and Tuscany, such as Martin from Florence, Pietro Catagno, Pietro Martín from Sicily (all of them involved in Atahualpa's capture), Juan Bautista Pastene, born in Genoa in 1505 and also present since the beginning of the Spanish Conquest of the Inca Empire. It is worthy to say that, in 1584, the first printing press was brought to the Viceroyalty of Peru by an Italian named \"Antonio Ricciardi Pedemontanus\".\n\nRadicati di Primeglio has done an exhaustive research about Italians in Lima and he found the well-documented existence of 343 Italians in Lima between 1532 and 1650 (this number can vary because many Italians were not registered). From these 343 Italians: 124 were from Genoa, 28 from Venice, 28 from Corsica, 15 from Naples, 11 from Milan, 10 from Rome, 5 from Sicily and the rest from other Italian states. Italians from Genoa used to work in the transport of passengers and merchandises between Callao and other Viceroyalty harbors to Panama. We can mention to Captains Giustiniani y Vicenzo Pascuale, who founded many navigation and trade enterprises between Callao and Valparaiso; Giovanni di Malta, Nicolo da Bonifilio, Alvaro Pastrello, Giovanni Gaetano; Enrique Porri from Milan, Lucas de Astra from Genoa; Nicoroso y Marcos Corso, captain Alessandro Malaspina.\n\nResearch done by historian Alberto Boscolo in his work Presencia italiana en Andalucía: Siglos XIV-XVII.\nrevealed that during the time of Pizarro these Italians were present in Peru\nJeronimo Bacarel (Sicily)merchant cattleman,\nFrancisco de Bolonia (Bologna,\nNicolao del Benino (Florence) merchant,\nFrancisco Rosso (Naples) conquistador,\nSebastino Castro (Sicily),\nPedro Catano (Italy) merchant),\nJuan antonio Corso (Corsica) merchant,\nBartolome Ferrer (Genoa) mariner merchant,\nMartin de Florencia (Italy) conquistador,\nAntonio Genoves (Genoa,\nCatalina la Genovesa (Valdepenaa),\nEsteban Genoves (Genoa) conquistador,\nJacomo Genoves (Genoa), \nRostran Genoves (Genoa) carpenter,\nSimon Genoves (Genoa) conquistador,\nIsabella Gentil (Seville),\nCesare Maneo (Naples),\nPedro Milanes (Milan) conquistador,\nMarco Negro (Venice),\nFrancisco Neri (Florence) merchant,\nJuan de Niza (Nizza aka Nice) conquistador,\nJacome Pablo (Venice), \nPedro Pinelo (Italy) merchant,\nDiego de Pisa (Pisa) conquistador,\nAntonio del Solar (Median del Campo),\nAlonso Toscano (Tuscany) merchant,\nJuan Toscano (Tuscany) religious,\nPedro Toscano (Tuscany) merchant,\nFray Francisco Martinez (Tuscany) religious,\n\nItalians who participated in the Rebellion of Gonzalo Pizarro\n\nJuan Bautista (Genoa) mariner,\nFrancisco Bonifacio (Savoy),\nBaptista Calvo (Genoa),\n\nOther Italians\nUrbano Centurione (Genoa) merchant,\nEstebano Cintana (Italy) mariner,\nAntonio de Ecogua (Genoa) mariner,\nLorenzo Fabiano (Italy),\nTomas Farco (Italy),\nNicolas Feo (Savoy),\nBernardo Genoves (Genoa),\nLeon Pancaldo (Savoy) mariner,\nBartolome Rabano (Italy) boatswain,\nFrancisco Ragano (Italy),\nTommaso Risso (Florence) nobleman,\nJuan Bautista Troche (Ventimiglia)\nJuan Pedro de Vivaldo (Genoa) sailing master.\n\nThere were also marines from Venice and from the Aegean Islands, like Pedro from [[Heraklion] AKA Crete] and Francisco from [[Cyprus]] (these places were under the Venetian dominion from 1204 to 1669); Anello Oliva, Ludovico Bertonio, Francesco Carletti, and the Prince of Santo Buono and Viceroy of Peru; Carmine Nicolao Caracciolo, born in [[Naples]] and Dr. Federico Bottoni who published a treaty about sanguineous circulation, in 1723.\n\nDuring the last decades of Spanish dominion in Perú, the number of Italians in Peru grew faster than in previous centuries (most of them came from [[Genoa]]). The richest ones were related to the marine commerce while the rest of Italians worked at small family-run business (such as grocery stores) or in larger enterprises along with their fellow Italians, as they were relatively skilled. [[Image:Chucuito callao.jpg|thumb|right|250px| While most [[Italians]] settled in the main cities, a group of [[Sicily#Demographics|Sicilian]] and [[Genovese]] fishers established in Chucuito, [[Callao]]]] The pioneers of the Italian immigration to Peru were Antonio Dagnino, who established in Callao in 1802 and Felix Valega, who arrived, in 1806. The same ship brought to the musician Andrea Bolognesi, father of the Peruvian National Hero \"[[Francisco Bolognesi]]\".\n\nThe first wave of Italian immigration to Peru occurred during the period 1840–1866 (the \"Guano\" Era): not less than 15,000 Italians arrived to Peru during this period (without counting the non-registered Italians) and established mainly in the coastal cities, especially, in [[Lima]] and [[Callao]]. They came, mostly, from the northern states ([[Liguria]], [[Piedmont]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Lombardy]]). [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] arrived to Peru in 1851, as well as other Italians who participated in the [[Five Days of Milan|Milan rebellion]] like Giuseppe Eboli, Steban Siccoli, [[Antonio Raimondi]], Arrigoni, etc.\n\nIn 1872, the \"Sociedad de Inmigración Europea\" (\"European Immigration Society\") was founded in Peru. Its objective was promoting [[Old World]] [[immigration]] by covering the costs of their journeys and financially supporting them during their first settler years in Peru. Furthermore, many Italians came in search for a better future, upon the arrival they established themselves in small business.\n\nDuring the second world war waves of Italian families started to immigrate to Peru; these families mainly settled in Lima. (Godbersen, 2006)\n\nMany Italian Peruvians intermarried and many Italian Peruvian families are related. Most Italian Peruvians live in the metropolitan area of Lima and the coastal cities. The Peruvian cuisine has been largely influenced by the Italian cuisine. In Chanchamayo there is an Italian colony in the Province of La Merced, founded by Italian immigrants.\n\n\n[[Colegio Italiano Antonio Raimondi]] is an Italian school in Lima.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Peru]]\n[[Category:European Peruvian]]\n[[Category:Peruvian people of Italian descent| ]]\n[[Category:Italian diaspora by country]]\n[[Category:Italian diaspora in South America]]"}

It was the main symbol of Burundi and its \"mwami\" (kings) and had semi-divine status. The \"mwami\" was said to interpret the beatings of the karyenda into rules for the kingdom.\n\nWhen Burundi gained independence from Belgium in 1962, the karyenda was the symbol on the national flag and its coat of arms from 1962 to 1966. It was replaced after the republic was established. Traditionally the most important folk songs and dances were performed to extol the virtues of the kingship. A major festival was the annual \"umuganuro\" (sorghum festival), which was a huge display of pomp, festivities, and dances for the royal court. Since the fall of the monarchy in 1966, and particularly after a massacre of Hutus in 1972, such cultural expressions have waned. \n\nThe second most important drum was the \"rukinzo\". It accompanied the \"mwami\" wherever he went.\n\nThe drums, despite many upheavals, have remained popular and are still revered. The old families who were wardens of the drums have tried to keep the ancient traditions alive. Some have an international outreach, such as the Royal Drummers of Burundi, or L. Ndoricimpa and C. Guillet, who recorded \"Les tambours du Burundi\" (\"The Drums of Burundi\") in 1983.\n\nAs sacred objects, the drums were much more than simple musical instruments. They were used in rituals, such as the \"umuganuro\", or for special circumstances. Major events for the king, such as royal coronations, funerals, and weddings were announced through the drums. The beating of the drums also signalled certain rites, such as when the \"mwami\" rose in the morning or retired in the evening.\n\nDrums had various names, such as \"dispenser of peace\" or \"lady of the land\".\n\nThe Royal Order of Karyenda and the Royal Order of Rukinzo were founded by King Mwambutsa IV of Burundi on July 1, 1962. The Order of Karyanda was the principal order of the kingdom and was divided into five classes.\n\nThe drums were normally kept in drum sanctuaries. These were a tight network of high places, as well as centres of political and religious power in pre-colonial Burundi. The sanctuaries were guarded mainly by Hutu families, who were the only ones the king allowed to manufacture, play, and keep the drums or bring them to court for an occasion. They were called \"abatimbo\", which is Rundi for drummers \"who hit hard\". A sacred drum was enthroned in each sanctuary and guarded by attendants. There were also \"ingendanyi\" (minor drums), and a set of drums that were played with the main drums.\n\nSome of the main sanctuaries for the drums were: Gishora Hill, near Gitega; Higiro Hill, also near Gitega; Magamba Hill; and Banga.\n\n"}

In spite of Dave's reluctance to become the Gypsies' new leader, Dave's father, Groffo (Judd Hirsch), resentful over not having been appointed leader, attempts to have Dave killed. Gruff is scheming and temperamental, and uses violence and threats to get the clan to do his bidding.

The artwork is an abstract bronze piece which tops a granite fountain.\n\n\"La Hermana del Hombre Bóveda\" is an abstract, figural, cast bronze artwork. The form wraps around a central cavity, which is the focal point when viewed from the front. Jutting edges that look as though they were ripped or chopped face the front, surrounding the circular cavity and contrasting with its smooth, hollowed surface. \n\nThe highly textured surface curves around the back to create a rounded form that evokes a woman’s backside. The texture is consistently applied, with sporadic scratches creating emphasis and texture throughout. The artwork was originally patinated a medium brown color, unevenly applied to emphasize texture and form. The highly polished central cavity originally had a bright, golden sheen – the natural color of the bronze. The polished and patinated surfaces were intended to play off of each other; the edge of the polished circle was slightly feathered into the rich brown. \n\nThe artwork is currently mounted on a granite base which is part of a fountain; the fountain rests on a limestone base. The artwork is secured to the top of the fountain by means of a custom-made piece of steel which is hooked to the edges of the hollow bottom of the artwork. This steel piece has fittings so that it and the bronze can be rotated and then lifted off of the fountain.

{"id": "355254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355254", "title": "Maya peoples", "text": "Maya peoples\n\nThe Maya peoples () are a large group of Indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. They inhabit southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. The overarching term \"Maya\" is a collective designation to include the peoples of the region that share some degree of cultural and linguistic heritage; however, the term embraces many distinct populations, societies, and ethnic groups that each have their own particular traditions, cultures, and historical identity.\n\nThere were an estimated six million Maya living in this area at the start of the 21st century. Guatemala, southern Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, Belize, El Salvador, and western Honduras have managed to maintain numerous remnants of their ancient cultural heritage. Some are quite integrated into the majority hispanicized Mestizo cultures of the nations in which they reside, while others continue a more traditional, culturally distinct life, often speaking one of the Mayan languages as a primary language.\n\nThe largest populations of contemporary Maya inhabit Guatemala, Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador, as well as large segments of population within the Mexican states of Yucatán, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, and Chiapas.\n\nOne of the largest groups of modern Maya can be found in Mexico's Yucatán State and the neighboring states of Campeche, Quintana Roo and in Belize. These peoples commonly identify themselves simply as \"Maya\" with no further ethnic subdivision (unlike in the Highlands of Western Guatemala). They speak the language which anthropologists term \"Yucatec Maya\", but is identified by speakers and Yucatecos simply as \"Maya\". Among Maya speakers, Spanish is commonly spoken as a second or first language.\n\nThere is a significant amount of confusion as to the correct terminology to use—Maya or Mayan—and the meaning of these words with reference to contemporary or pre-Columbian peoples, to Maya peoples in different parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and to languages or peoples.\n\nLinguists refer to the Maya language as Yucatec or Yucatec Maya to distinguish it from other Mayan languages. This norm has often been misinterpreted to mean that the people are also called Yucatec Maya; that term refers only to the language, and the correct name for the people is simply Maya (not Mayans). Maya is one language in the Mayan language family. Thus, to refer to Maya as Mayans would be similar to referring to Spanish people as Romantics because they speak a language belonging to the Romance language family. Confusion of the term Maya/Mayan as an ethnic label occurs because Maya women who use traditional dress identify by the ethnic term \"mestiza\" and not Maya.\n\nPersons use a strategy of ethnic identification that Juan Castillo Cocom refers to as \"ethnoexodus\"—meaning that ethnic self-identification as Maya is quite variable, situational, and articulated not to processes of producing group identity, but of escaping from discriminatory processes of sociocultural marginalization.\n\nThe Yucatán's indigenous population was first exposed to Europeans after a party of Spanish shipwreck survivors came ashore in 1511. One of the sailors, Gonzalo Guerrero, is reported to have taken up with a local woman and started a family; he became a counselor among a local polity near present-day Chetumal. Later Spanish expeditions to the region were led by Córdoba in 1517, Grijalva in 1518, and Cortés in 1519. From 1528 to 1540, several attempts by Francisco Montejo to conquer the Yucatán failed. His son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger, fared almost as badly when he first took over: while desperately holding out at Chichen Itza, he lost 150 men in a single day. European diseases, massive recruitment of native warriors from Campeche and Champoton, and internal hatred between the Xiu Maya and the lords of Cocom eventually turned the tide for Montejo the Younger. Chichen Itza was conquered by 1570. In 1542, the western Yucatán Peninsula also surrendered to him.\nHistorically, the population in the eastern half of the peninsula was less affected by and less integrated with Hispanic culture than the western half. In the 21st century in the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexican states of Campeche, Yucatán and Quintana Roo), between 750,000 and 1,200,000 people speak Mayan. However, three times more than that are of Maya origins, hold ancient Maya surnames, and do not speak Mayan languages as their first language.\n\nMatthew Restall, in his book \"The Maya Conquistador\", mentions a series of letters sent to the King of Spain in the 16th and 17th centuries. The noble Maya families at that time signed documents to the Spanish Royal Family; surnames mentioned in those letters are Pech, Camal, Xiu, Ucan, Canul, Cocom, and Tun, among others.\n\nA large 19th-century revolt by the native Maya people of Yucatán (Mexico), known as the Caste War of Yucatán, was one of the most successful modern Native American revolts. For a period the Maya state of Chan Santa Cruz was recognized as an independent nation by the British Empire, particularly in terms of trading with British Honduras.\nFrancisco Luna-Kan was elected governor of the state of Yucatán from 1976 to 1982. Luna-Kan was born in Mérida, Yucatán, and he was a Doctor of medicine, then a Professor of Medicine before his political offices. He was first appointed as overseer of the state's rural medical system. He was the first Governor of the modern Yucatán Peninsula to be of full Maya ancestry. In the early 21st century, dozens of politicians, including Deputies, Majors and Senators, are of full or mixed Maya heritage from the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Geography and Informatics (Mexico's INEGI), in Yucatán State there were 1.2 million Mayan speakers in 2009, representing 59.5% of the inhabitants. Due to this, the cultural section of the government of Yucatán began on-line classes for grammar and proper pronunciation of Maya.\n\nMaya people from Yucatán Peninsula living in the United States of America have been organizing Maya language lessons and Maya cooking classes since 2003 in California and other states: clubs of Yucatec Maya are registered in Dallas and Irving, Texas; Salt Lake City in Utah; Las Vegas, Nevada; and California, with groups in San Francisco, San Rafael, Chino, Pasadena, Santa Ana, Garden Grove, Inglewood, Los Angeles, Thousand Oaks, Oxnard, San Fernando Valley and Whittier.\n\nChiapas was for many years one of the regions of Mexico that was least touched by the reforms of the Mexican Revolution. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation, launched a rebellion against the Mexican state, Chiapas in January 1994, declared itself to be an indigenous movement and drew its strongest and earliest support from Chiapan Maya. Today its number of supporters is relevant. (see also the EZLN and the Chiapas conflict)\n\nMaya groups in Chiapas include the Tzotzil and Tzeltal, in the highlands of the state, the Tojolabalis concentrated in the lowlands around Las Margaritas, and the Ch'ol in the jungle. (see map)\n\nThe most traditional of Maya groups are the Lacandon, a small population avoiding contact with outsiders until the late 20th century by living in small groups in the Lacandon Jungle. These Lacandon Maya came from the Campeche/Petén area (north-east of Chiapas) and moved into the Lacandon rain-forest at the end of the 18th century.\n\nIn the course of the 20th century, and increasingly in the 1950s and 1960s, other people (mainly the Maya and subsistence peasants from the highlands), also entered into the Lacandon region; initially encouraged by the government. This immigration led to land-related conflicts and an increasing pressure on the rainforest. To halt the migration, the government decided in 1971 to declare a large part of the forest (614,000 hectares, or 6140 km) a protected area: the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. They appointed only one small population group (the 66 Lacandon families) as tenants (thus creating the Lacandon Community), thereby displacing 2000 Tzeltal and Ch'ol families from 26 communities, and leaving non-Lacandon communities dependent on the government for granting their rights to land. In the decades that followed the government carried out numerous programs to keep the problems in the region under control, using land distribution as a political tool; as a way of ensuring loyalty from different campesino groups. This strategy of divide and rule led to great disaffection and tensions among population groups in the region.\n(see also the Chiapas conflict and the Lacandon Jungle).\n\nThe Maya population in Belize is concentrated in the Corozal, Cayo, Toledo and Orange Walk districts, but they are scattered throughout the country. The Maya are thought to have been in Belize and the Yucatán region since the second millennium BC. Much of Belize's original Maya population died as a result of new infectious diseases and conflicts between tribes and with Europeans. They are divided into the Yucatec, Kekchi, and Mopan. These three Maya groups now inhabit the country.\n\nThe Yucatec Maya (many of whom came from Yucatán, Mexico to escape the Caste War of the 1840s) there have been evidence of several Yucatec Maya groups living by the Yalbac area of Belize and in the Orange Walk district near the present day Lamanai at the time the British reach. The Mopan (indigenous to Belize but were forced out by the British; they returned from Guatemala to evade slavery in the 19th century), and Kek'Chi (also fled from slavery in Guatemala in the 19th century). The later groups are chiefly found in the Toledo District.\n\nThe Mexican state of Tabasco is home to the Chontal Maya.\n\nIn Guatemala, indigenous people of Maya descent comprise around 40% of the population. The largest and most traditional Maya populations are in the western highlands in the departments of Baja Verapaz, Quiché, Totonicapán, Huehuetenango, Quetzaltenango, and San Marcos; their inhabitants are mostly Maya.\n\nThe Maya people of the Guatemala highlands include the Achi, Akatek, Chuj, Ixil, Jakaltek, Kaqchikel, K'iche', Mam, Poqomam, Poqomchi', Q'anjob'al, Q'eqchi', Tz'utujil and Uspantek.\n\nThe Q'eqchi' live in lowland areas of Alta Vera Paz, Peten, and Western Belize. Over the course of the succeeding centuries a series of land displacements, re-settlements, persecutions and migrations resulted in a wider dispersal of Q'eqchi' communities, into other regions of Guatemala (Izabal, Petén, El Quiché). They are the 2nd largest ethnic Maya group in Guatemala (after the K'iche') and one of the largest and most widespread throughout Central America.\n\nIn Guatemala, the Spanish colonial pattern of keeping the native population legally separate and subservient continued well into the 20th century. This resulted in many traditional customs being retained, as the only other option than traditional Maya life open to most Maya was entering the Hispanic culture at the very bottom rung. Because of this many Guatemalan Maya, especially women, continue to wear traditional clothing, that varies according to their specific local identity.\n\nThe southeastern region of Guatemala (bordering with Honduras) includes groups such as the Ch'orti'. The northern lowland Petén region includes the Itza, whose language is near extinction but whose agro-forestry practices, including use of dietary and medicinal plants may still tell us much about pre-colonial management of the Maya lowlands.\n\nThe 36 year long Guatemalan Civil War left more than 200,000 people dead, half a million driven from their homes, and at least 100,000 women raped; most of the victims were Maya.\n\nThe genocide against Mayan people took place throughout the whole civil war because indigenous people were seen as supporting the leftist guerillas, but most acts against humanity occurred during Efraín Ríos Montt's presidency (1982-1983). Ríos Montt instituted a campaign of state terror intended to destroy the Mayas in the name of countering “communist subversion” and ridding the country of its indigenous culture. This was also known as Operation Sofia. Within Operation Sofia, the military followed through with \"scorched earth policies\" which allowed them to destroy whole villages, including killing livestock, destroying cultural symbols, destroying crops, and murdering civilians. In some areas, government forces killed about 40% of the total population; the campaign destroyed at least 626 Mayan villages. \n\nOn January 26, 2012 former president Ríos Montt was formally indicted in Guatemala for overseeing the massacre of 1,771 civilians of the Ixil Maya group and appeared in court for genocide and crimes against humanity for which he was then sentenced to 80 years in prison on May 10, 2013. This ruling was overturned by the constitutional court on May 20, 2013 over alleged irregularities in the handling of the case. The ex-president appeared in court again on January 5, 2015 amongst protest form his lawyers regarding his health conditions and on August 25, 2015 it was deliberated that a re-trial of the 2013 proceedings could find Ríos Montt guilty or not, but that the sentence would be suspended. Ríos Montt died on April 1, 2018 of a heart attack.\n\nThe Maya people are known for their brightly colored, yarn-based, textiles that are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, huipiles and dresses. Each village has its own distinctive pattern, making it possible to distinguish a person's home town. Women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt.\n\nThe Maya religion is Roman Catholicism combined with the indigenous Maya religion to form the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout the country and still does in the rural regions prior to 2010s of \"orthodoxing\" the western rural areas by Christian Orthodox missionaries. Beginning from negligible roots prior to 1960s, however, Protestant Pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of Guatemala City and other urban centers, later to 2010s that almost of all Maya of several rural areas of West Guatemala, living rural areas were mostly mass converted from Catholicism or possibly Maya religion due of various reasons to either Eastern or Oriental Orthodoxy by late Fr. Andres Giron and some other Orthodox missionaries, and also smaller to mid-sized towns also slowly converted as well since 2013. The unique religion is reflected in the local saint, Maximón, who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution. Always depicted in black, he wears a black hat and sits on a chair, often with a cigar placed in his mouth and a gun in his hand, with offerings of tobacco, alcohol, and Coca-Cola at his feet. The locals know him as San Simon of Guatemala.\n\nThe Popol Vuh is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the K'iche' language, and one of the most important of Pre-Columbian American literature. It is a compendium of Maya stories and legends, aimed to preserve Maya traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quiché transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Maya Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of Pre-Columbian America. The Rabinal Achí is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Toj K'iche' rulers of Rabinal, and their relationships with neighboring K'iche' of Q'umarkaj. The Rabinal Achí is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of Saint Paul. It was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by UNESCO in 2005. The 16th century saw the first native-born Guatemalan writers that wrote in Spanish.\n\nThere is an undeniable symbiotic relationship between cultural heritage, tourism, and a national identity. In the case of the Maya, the many national identities have been constructed because of the growing demands placed on them by cultural tourism. By focusing on lifeways through costumes, rituals, diet, handicrafts, language, housing, or other features, the identity of the economy shifts from the sale of labor to that of the sale of culture.\n\nGlobal tourism is now considered one of the largest scale movement of goods, services, and people in history and a significant catalyst for economic development and sociopolitical change. Estimated that between 35 and 40 percent of tourism today is represented by cultural tourism or heritage tourism, this alternative to mass tourism offers opportunities for place-based engagement that frames context for interaction by the lived space and everyday life of other peoples, as well as sites and objects of global historical significance. In this production of tourism the use of historic symbols, signs, and topics form a new side that characterizes a nation and can play an active role in nation building.\n\nWith this type of tourism, people argue that ethno-commerce may open unprecedented opportunities for creating value of various kinds. Tourists travel with cultural expectations, which has created a touristic experience sometimes faced with the need to invent traditions of artificial and contrived attractions, often developed at the expense of local tradition and meanings.\n\nAn example of this can be seen in “Mayanizing Tourism on Roatan Island, Honduras: Archaeological Perspectives on Heritage, Development, and Indignity.” Alejandro j. Figueroa et al., combine archaeological data and ethnographic insights to explore a highly contested tourism economy in their discussion of how places on Roatan Island, Honduras, have become increasingly “Mayanized” over the past decade. As tour operators and developers continue to invent an idealized Maya past for the island, non-Maya archaeological remains and cultural patrimony are constantly being threatened and destroyed. While heritage tourism provides economic opportunities for some, it can devalue contributions made by less familiar groups.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40777171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40777171", "title": "Mestizos in Mexico", "text": "Mestizos in Mexico\n\nIn Mexico, the term Mestizo (lit. mixed) is used to refer to an ethnic group that can be defined by different criteria, namely a cultural criterion (the language spoken) or a more strict biological criterion. Because of this, estimates of the number of Mestizos in Mexico do vary.\n\nThe meaning of the word \"Mestizo\" has changed over time. The word was originally used in the colonial era to refer to individuals who were of half-Spanish and half-Amerindian ancestry and it was one of the many extant castes used to classify individuals. While the caste system and racial classifications were officially abandoned once Mexico achieved its independence, the label mestizo was still used in academic circles: now to refer to all the people who were mixed race. It was in those academic circles that the \"Mestizaje\" or \"Cosmic Race\" ideology was created, the ideology asserted that Mestizos are the result of the mixing of all the races and that all of Mexico's population must become Mestizo so Mexico can finally achieve prosperity. After the Mexican Revolution the government, on its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions adopted and actively promoted the \"Mestizaje\" ideology, by 1930 racial identities other than \"Indigenous\" disappeared from the Mexican census, however at an institutional level all Mexicans who did not speak indigenous languages where now considered to be Mestizos, transforming what once was a racial identity into a cultural one.\n\nIn consequence, today people of very different phenotypes make up the Mestizo population in Mexico independently of whether they are mixed race or not. However, since the term carries a variety of socio-cultural, economic, racial, and genetic meanings, estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely. According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", which uses as base the results of the 1921 census, between one half and two thirds of the Mexican population is Mestizo. A culture-based estimate gives the percentage of Mestizos as high as 90%-93%. Paradoxically, the word Mestizo has long been dropped from popular Mexican vocabulary, with the word even having pejorative connotations, which further complicates attempts to quantify Mestizos via self-identification. In recent times, modern academics have challenged the Mestizaje concept, on the grounds that historical census data shows that marriages between people of different races were rare and that rather than ending racism, the ideology has incentivated it as it does negate the existence of the multiple ethnic groups and cultures that coexist in Mexico.\n\nThe exact date on which the term Mestizo and the caste system as a whole were introduced to Mexico is not known, however, the earliest surviving records that categorized people by different \"qualities\" (as castes were known in early colonial Mexico) are church birth and marriage records from the late 18th century. Back then there was an extensive caste system which assigned a different caste name for each possible racial combination, thus unlike definitions of \"Mestizo\" that would appear later, in these records \"Mestizo\" referred strictly to people who were of half Spanish and half indigenous ancestry. The same system is present in the first ever national population census of New Spain made in 1793, on which besides \"Mestizo\" the classification \"castizo\", \"pardo\", \"mulatto\", \"zambo\" etc. are present and are referred as a whole as \"castes\". After independence the caste system and racial censuses were legally abandoned which led to academics who reviewed and republished the census figures to refer to the \"castes\" collective simply as \"Mestizos\". \n\nThe aforementioned, new definition of “Mestizo” would be the one used in the 1921 census (the second nationwide census that included a comprehensive racial classification in Mexico‘s history). Made right after the consummation of the Mexican revolution, the social context on which this census was made makes it particularly unique, as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking forward to uniting all Mexicans under a single national identity, the government found the identity it was looking for in the “mestizaje” or “cosmic race” ideology forged mainly by prominent academics and politicians José Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio. The ideology asserted that Mexican Mestizos were the result of the mixing of all the races, obtaining the best qualities of each and that for Mexico to finally achieve prosperity all of the country’s population had to become Mestizo. By the 1930 census, the racial classifications of “White” and “Mestizo” disappeared, however implicitly all Mexicans who did not speak an indigenous language were now considered to be Mestizos. The government also implemented cultural policies designed to \"help\" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, aiming to solve the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo ones. \n\nThe institutional enforcement of the Mestizaje ideology would continue until after the first decade of the 21st century, when Mexico’s government begun to recognize at a degree the different ethnicities that conform Mexico’s non-indigenous population, likely due recommendations of Mexico’s modern academic circles, which nowadays criticize the ideology claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of “(Racism) Not existing here (Mexico), as everybody is Mestizo” said critics assert that the Mestizaje ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico as while at an institutional level a Mexican who is of Indigenous or African appearance and one who is of European appearance are of the same race, on everyday interactions they get inevitably perceived and treated differently by Mexico’s society. Other criticisms claim that the ideology couldn’t homogenize the different races that lived within Mexico because at its root, the ideology sought the “whitening” of Indigenous peoples and never the “indianization” of Whites or that it has accidentally erased from history minority ethnic groups such as Afro-Mexicans. In general, the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole.\n\nOutside of Mexico, the word \"mestizo\" is still used to refer to persons with mixed Indigenous and European ancestry. This usage does not conform to the modern Mexican usage of the word where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language, and a person with a very low or without any percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage. In some regions of Mexico such as the Yucatán peninsula the word Mestizo is used to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos. In Chiapas, the term Ladino is used instead of Mestizo.\n\nOverall, the term \"Mestizo\" is no longer in wide use in contemporary Mexican society, with its use being limited to social and cultural studies when referring to the non-indigenous part of the Mexican population. The word has somewhat pejorative connotations and most of the Mexican citizens who would be defined as mestizos in the sociological literature would probably self-identify as Mexicans, which complicate their quantification via self-identification. This is a direct contrast to ethno racial terms such as “Indian” “White” “Black” etc. who are still prominent in everyday social interactions in Mexico, it is not exactly known why this happened but is attributed to Mexicans simply favoring the use of “static” ethnic labels over “fluid” ones.\n\nMexicans who are biologically Mestizos are primarily of European and Native American ancestry. The third largest component is sub-Saharan African, a legacy of the slavery in New Spain (which saw the importation of some 100,000-200,000 black slaves). However, geneticists theorize that in regions of Mexico that did not have any presence of slaves, traces of African ancestry might have come from Spanish colonists and not African slaves themselves, as said ancestry is of North African and Near East origin. Depending on the region, some may have small traces of Asian admixture due the thousands of Filipinos and \"Chinos\" (Asian slaves of diverse origin, not just Chinese) that arrived on the \"Nao de China\". More recent Asian immigration (specifically Chinese) may help explain the comparatively high Asian contribution in Northwest Mexico (i.e., Sonora). The INMEGEN report also notes that on average, the largest genetic component of the self-identified Mestizo Mexicans is indigenous, while African and Asian genetic markers are diminishing with each generation and will continue to do so without new migration. For example, there were an estimated 600,000 \"Afromestizos\" or Mestizos of significant African descent at the end of the colonial period which roughly amounted to 10% of the population (Euromestizos and indomestizos were estimeted at 1,000,000 and 600,000 respectively) while as of 2015, the number of self identified Afro-Mexicans was 1.38 million (1.2% of the population).\n\nThe Mestizaje ideology, which has blurred the lines of race at an institutional level has also had a significative influence in genetic studies done in Mexico: As the criteria used in studies to determine if a Mexican is Mestizo or indigenous often lies in cultural traits such as the language spoken instead of racial self-identification or a phenotype-based selection there are studies on which populations who are considered to be Indigenous per virtue of the language spoken such as Nahua peoples from the state of Veracruz show a higher degree of European genetic admixture than the one populations considered to be Mestizo report in other studies. The opposite also happens, as there instances on which populations considered to be Mestizo show genetic frequencies very similar to continental European peoples in the case of Mestizos from the state of Durango or to European derived Americans in the case of Mestizos from the state of Jalisco.\n\nGenetic research in the Mexican population is numerous and has yielded a myriad of different results, it is not rare that different genetic studies done in the same location vary greatly, clear examples of said variation are the city of Monterrey in the state of Nuevo León, which, depending of the study presents an average European ancestry ranging from 38% to 78%, and Mexico City, whose European admixture ranges from as little as 21%\nto 70%, reasons behind such variation may include the socioeconomic background of the analyzed samples as well as the criteria to recruit volunteers: some studies only analyze Mexicans who self-identify as Mestizos, others may classify the entire Mexican population as \"mestizo\", other studies may do both, such as the 2009 genetic study published by the INMEGEN (Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine), which states that 93% of the Mexican population is Mestizo with the remaining being Amerindian, however for its study the institute only recruited people who explicitly self-identified as mestizos. Finally there are studies who avoid using any racial classification whatsoever, including in them any person that self-identifies as Mexican, these studies are the ones who usually report the highest European admixture for a given location.\nRegardless of the criteria used all the autosomal DNA studies made coincide on there being a significant genetic variation depending on the region analyzed, with southern Mexico having prevalent Amerindian and small but higher than average African genetic contributions, the central region of Mexico showing a balance between Amerindian and European components, and the latter gradually increasing as one travels northwards and westwards, where European ancestry becomes the majority of the genetic contribution up until cities located at the Mexico-United States border, where studies suggest there is a significant resurgence of Amerindian and African admixture.\n\nA 2006 study conducted by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN), which genotyped 104 samples, reported that mestizo Mexicans are 59% European, 35% \"Asian\" (primarily Amerindian), and 5% Other.\n\nResearch conducted by the country's \"Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genómica\" (INMEGEN) has found that Mexico's Mestizo population is not uniform in its genetic composition, with there being significant regional variation. For example, mestizos of primarily European ancestry predominate in Sonora, while mestizos from the central region (Guanajuato and Zacatecas) have a more even split between indigenous and European. The highest African contribution in the twelve participating states (picked to be representative of the major regions of Mexico) was found in Guerrero and Veracruz, while the highest Asian contribution was found in Guerrero and Sonora.\n\nA study made by the University College London which included the countries of Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Brazil, and was made with collaboration of each countries' antrophology and genetics institutes reported the genetic ancestry of Mexican Mestizos was 56% Native American, 37% European and 5% African making Mexico, after Peru, the country with the highest Amerindian ancestry out of the five sample populations. Additionally, different phenotypical traits were analyzed, with the study determining that the frequency of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans was of 18.5% and 28.5% respectively,\nmaking Mexico also the country with the second highest frequency of blond hair in the study. The reason behind such discrepancy between phenotypical traits and genetic ancestry may lie in the low African contribution found within the Mexican population relative to Brazil and Colombia. In addition, the samples used in Mexico's case were highly unproportional, as the northern and western regions of Mexico contain 45% of Mexico's population, but no more than 10% of the samples used in the study came from the states located in these regions. For the most part, the rest of the samples hailed from Mexico City and southern Mexican states.\n\nAdditional studies suggests a tendency relating a higher European admixture with a higher socioeconomic status and a higher Amerindian ancestry with a lower socioeconomic status: a study made exclusively on low income Mestizos residing in Mexico City found the mean admixture to be 0.590, 0.348, and 0.062 for Amerindian, European and African respectively whereas the European admixture increased to an average of around 70% on mestizos belonging to a higher socioeconomical level. In 2011, an autosomal dna study was conducted in Mexico city, with 1,310 samples, showing the average proportion of Native American, European, and African ancestry for the population to be 64%, 32%, and 4% respectively. Additional autosomal dna studies conducted on people from Mexico city show a predominate Native American background, with Native American ancestry ranging from 61-69% in 5 different studies. The number of people sampled in these studies ranged from 66 to 984 people. One outlier study showed a predominate European background for mestizos of Mexico City, showing 57% European ancestry, 40% Native American ancestry, and 3% African ancestry. The sample population for this study however, was only 19 people.\n\nA 2012 study published by the \"Journal of Human Genetics\" Y chromosomes found the deep paternal ancestry of the Mexican mestizo population to be predominately European (64.9%), followed by Amerindian (30.8%) and Asian (1.2%).\nThe European Y chromosome was more prevalent in the north and west (66.7-95%) and Native American ancestry increased in the center and southeast (37-50%), the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous (0-8.8%). The states that participated in this study where Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Yucatán. The largest amount of chromosomes found were identified as belonging to the haplogroups from Western Europe, East Europe and Eurasia, Siberia and the Americas and Northern Europe with relatively smaller traces of haplogroups from Central Asia, South-east Asia, South-central Asia, Western Asia, The Caucasus, North Africa, Near East, East Asia, North-east Asia, South-west Asia and the Middle East. Also a study published in 2011 on Mexican Mitochondrial DNA found that maternal ancestry was predominately Native American (85-90%), with a minority having European (5–7%) or African (3–5%) mtDNA.\n\nAn autosomal ancestry study performed on Mexico city reported that the European ancestry of Mexicans was 52% with the rest being Amerindian and a small African contribution, additionally maternal ancestry was analyzed, with 47% being of European origin. The only criteria for sample selection was that the volunteers self-identified as Mexicans.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "351151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351151", "title": "Pied-Noir", "text": "Pied-Noir\n\nPied-Noir (, \"Black-Foot\"), plural Pieds-Noirs, is a term primarily referring to people of European, mostly ethnic French origin, who were born in Algeria during the period of French rule from 1830 to 1962. More broadly, it can refer to other foreign-origin persons, both Christian and Jewish, from all parts of the Mediterranean whose families had also migrated under French occupation in the 19th and 20th centuries to French Algeria, the French protectorate in Morocco, or the French protectorate of Tunisia, where many carried on living for several generations but fled or were expelled at the end of French rule in North Africa between 1956 and 1962. The term sometimes also includes the pre-existing North African Jews who had been living there prior to French colonization, whether Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews who had arrived after the expulsion from Sepharad (Spain and Portugal) several centuries earlier in 1492 or even earlier Berber-speaking and/or Arabic-speaking Maghrebi Jews who had been residing there for over a thousand years, all of which were nonetheless awarded French citizenship by the 1870 Crémieux Decree whilst the rest of the native Muslim population was maintained in a second class status with the \"Code de l'Indigénat\" (ref Indigénat). More specifically, the term \"Pied-Noir\" is used for those of European ancestry who \"returned\" to mainland France as soon as Algeria gained independence, or in the months following.\n\nFrom the French invasion on 18 June 1830 until its independence, Algeria was administratively part of France, and its European population was simply called Algerians or colons (colonists), whereas the Muslim people of Algeria were called Arabs, Muslims or Indigenous.\n\nThe term \"pied-noir\" began to be commonly used shortly before the end of the Algerian War in 1962. As of the last census in French-ruled Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians (mostly Catholic, but including 130,000 Algerian Jews) in Algeria, 10 percent of the total population.\n\nDuring the Algerian War the \"Pieds-Noirs\" overwhelmingly supported colonial French rule in Algeria and were opposed to Algerian nationalist groups such as the \"Front de libération nationale\" (English: National Liberation Front) (FLN) and \"Mouvement national algérien\" (English: Algerian National Movement) (MNA). The roots of the conflict reside in political and economic inequalities perceived as an \"alienation\" from the French rule as well as a demand for a leading position for the Berber, Arab, and Islamic cultures and rules existing before the French conquest. The conflict contributed to the fall of the French Fourth Republic and the mass exodus of Algerian Europeans and Jews to France.\n\nAfter Algeria became independent in 1962, about 800,000 \"Pieds-Noirs\" of French nationality were evacuated to mainland France while about 200,000 chose to remain in Algeria. Of the latter, there were still about 100,000 in 1965 and about 50,000 by the end of the 1960s.\n\nThose who moved to France suffered ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims and some blamed them for the war, thus the political turmoil surrounding the collapse of the French Fourth Republic. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria. Thus, the recent history of the \"Pieds-Noirs\" has been imprinted with a theme of double alienation from both their native homeland and their adopted land. Though the term \"rapatriés d'Algérie\" implies that they once lived in France, most \"Pieds-Noirs\" were born in Algeria. Many families had lived there for generations, and the Algerian Jews, who were considered \"Pieds-Noirs\", were as indigenous to Algeria as its Muslim population.\n\nThere are competing theories about the origin of the term \"pied-noir\". According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", it refers to \"a person of European origin living in Algeria during the period of French rule, especially a French person expatriated after Algeria was granted independence in 1962.\" The \"Le Robert\" dictionary states that in 1901 the word indicated a sailor working barefoot in the coal room of a ship, who would find his feet dirtied by the soot and dust. Since, in the Mediterranean, this was often an Algerian native, the term was used pejoratively for Algerians until 1955 when it first began referring to \"French born in Algeria\" according to some sources. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" claims this usage originated from mainland French as a negative nickname.\n\nThere is also a theory that the term comes from the black boots of French soldiers compared to the barefoot Algerians. Other theories focus on new settlers dirtying their clothing by working in swampy areas, wearing black boots when on horseback, or trampling grapes to make wine.\n\nEuropean settlement of Algeria began during the 1830s, after France had commenced the process of conquest with the military seizure of the city of Algiers in 1830. The invasion was instigated when the Dey of Algiers struck the French consul with a fly-swatter in 1827, although economic reasons are also cited. In 1830 the government of King Charles X blockaded Algeria and an armada sailed to Algiers, followed by a land expedition. A troop of 34,000 soldiers landed on 18 June 1830, at Sidi Ferruch, west of Algiers. Following a three-week campaign, the Hussein Dey capitulated on 5 July 1830, and was exiled.\n\nIn the 1830s the French controlled only the northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000 troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.\nIn 1848 Algeria was divided into three départements of France, Alger, Oran, and Constantine, thus becoming part of the French state.\n\nThe French modeled their colonial system on their predecessors, the Ottomans, by co-opting local tribes. In 1843 the colonists began supervising through \"Bureaux Arabes\" operated by military officials with authority over particular domains. This system lasted until the 1880s and the rise of the French Third Republic, when colonization intensified. Large-scale regrouping of lands began when land-speculation companies took advantage of government policy that allowed massive sale of native property. By the 20th century Europeans held 1,700,000 hectares; of Algeria. Settlers came from all over the western Mediterranean region, particularly Italy, France, Spain, and Malta.\n\nThe \"Pied-Noir\" relationship with France and Algeria was marked by alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, but many of the \"Pieds-Noirs\" had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited. The settlers encompassed a range of socioeconomic \"strata\", ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as \"grands colons\".\n\nIn Algeria, the Muslims were not considered French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million \"Pieds-Noirs\") at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, they were required to renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500 Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.\n\nFrom roughly the last half of the 19th century until independence, the \"Pieds-Noirs\" accounted for approximately 10% of the total Algerian population. Although they constituted a numerical minority, they were undoubtedly the prime political and economic force of the region.\n\nIn 1959, the \"Pieds-Noirs\" numbered 1,025,000, and accounted for 10.4% of the total population of Algeria, a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of \"Pieds-Noirs\", such as the regions of Bône (now Annaba), Algiers, and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès. Oran had been under European rule since the 17th century, and the population in the Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European and Jewish in 1959. In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans and Jewish people accounted for 35.7% of the population. In the metropolitan area of Bône they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The \"département\" of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520 km² (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest \"Pied-Noir\" density outside of the cities, with the \"Pieds-Noirs\" accounting for 33.6% of the population of the \"département\" in 1959.\n\nJews were present in North Africa and Iberia for centuries, some since the time when \"Phoenicians and Hebrews, engaged in maritime commerce, founded Hippo Regius (current Annaba), Tipasa, Caesarea (current Cherchel), and Icosium (current Algiers)\". According to oral tradition they arrived from Judea after the First Jewish-Roman War (66–73 AD), while it is known historically that many Sephardi Jews came following the Spanish \"Reconquista\". In 1870, Justice Minister Adolphe Crémieux wrote a proposal, \"décret Crémieux\", giving French citizenship to Algerian Jews. This advancement was resisted by part of the larger \"Pied-Noir\" community and in 1897 a wave of anti-Semitic riots occurred in Algeria. During World War II the \"décret Crémieux\" was abolished under the Vichy regime, and Jews were barred from professional jobs between 1940 and 1943. Citizenship was restored in 1943. Thus, the Jews of Algeria eventually came to be considered part of the \"Pied-Noir\" community, and many fled the country to France in 1962, alongside most other \"Pieds-Noirs\", after the Algerian War.\n\nFor more than a century France maintained colonial rule in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including Sharia laws applied by Islamic customary courts to Muslim women which gave women certain rights to property and inheritance that they did not have under French law. Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties. Algerian nationalists began efforts aimed at furthering equality by listing complaints in the \"Manifesto of the Algerian People\", which requested equal representation under the state and access to citizenship, but no equality for all citizens to preserve Islamic precepts. The French response was to grant citizenship to 60,000 \"meritorious\" Muslims. During a reform effort in 1947, the French created a bicameral legislature with one house for the French citizens and another for the Muslims; but gave a European's vote equal seven times more weight than a Muslim's vote. Paramilitary groups such as the National Liberation Front (\"Front de Libération nationale\", FLN) appeared, claiming an Arab-Islamic brotherhood and state. This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the Algerian War, in 1954.\nFrom the first armed operations of November 1954, \"Pied-Noir\" civilians had always been targets for the FLN, either by assassination; bombing bars and cinemas; mass massacres; torture; and rapes in farms.\nAt the onset of the war, the \"Pieds-Noirs\" believed the French military would be able to overcome opposition. In May 1958 a demonstration for French Algeria, led by \"Pieds-Noirs\" but including many Muslims, occupied an Algerian government building. General Jacques Massu controlled the riot by forming a 'Committee of Public Safety' demanding that his acquaintance Charles de Gaulle be named president of the French Fourth Republic, to prevent the \"abandonment of Algeria\". This eventually led to the fall of the Republic. In response, the French Parliament voted 329 to 224 to place de Gaulle in power. Once de Gaulle assumed leadership, he attempted peace by visiting Algeria within three days of his appointment, proclaiming \"French Algeria!\"; but in September 1959 he planned a referendum for Algerian self-determination that passed overwhelmingly. Many French political and military leaders in Algeria viewed this as a betrayal and formed the \"Organisation armée secrète\" (OAS) that had much support among \"Pieds-Noirs\". This paramilitary group began attacking officials representing de Gaulle's authority, Muslims, and de Gaulle himself. The OAS was also accused of murders and bombings which nullified any remaining reconciliation opportunities between the communities, while \"Pieds-Noirs\" themselves never believed such reconciliation possible as their community was targeted from the start.\n\nThe opposition culminated in the Algiers putsch of 1961, led by retired generals. After its failure, on 18 March 1962, de Gaulle and the FLN signed a cease-fire agreement, the Évian Accords, and held a referendum. In July, Algerians voted 5,975,581 to 16,534 to become independent from France.\nThis triggered a massacre of \"Pieds-Noirs\" in Oran by a suburban Muslim population. European people were shot, molested and brought to Petit-Lac slaughterhouse where they were tortured and executed.\n\nThe exodus began once it became clear that Algeria would become independent. In Algiers, it was reported that by May 1961 the \"Pieds-Noirs' \" morale had sunk because of violence and allegations that the entire community of French nationals had been responsible for \"terrorism, torture, colonial racism, and ongoing violence in general\" and because the group felt \"rejected by the nation as \"Pieds-Noirs\" \". These factors, the Oran Massacre, and the referendum for independence caused the \"Pied-Noir\" exodus to begin in earnest.\n\nThe number of \"Pieds-Noirs\" who fled Algeria totalled more than 800,000 between 1962 and 1964. Many \"Pieds-Noirs\" left only with what they could carry in a suitcase. Adding to the confusion, the de Gaulle government ordered the French Navy not to help with transportation of French citizens. By September 1962, cities such as Oran, Bône, and Sidi Bel Abbès were half-empty. All administration-, police-, school-, justice-, and commercial activities stopped within three months after many \"Pieds-Noirs\" were told to choose either \"la valise ou le cercueil\" (the suitcase or the coffin). 200,000 \"Pieds-Noirs\" chose to remain, but they gradually left through the following decade; by the 1980s only a few thousand \"Pieds-Noirs\" remained in Algeria.\n\nThe flight of the \"Pieds-Noirs\" dwarfed that of the Muslim harkis who had fought on the French side during the Algerian War. Of approximately 250,000 Muslim loyalists only about 90,000, including dependents, were able to escape to France; and of those who remained many thousands were killed by lynch mobs or executed as traitors by the FLN. In contrast to the treatment of the European \"Pieds-Noirs\", little effort was made by the French government to extend protection to the harkis or to arrange their organised evacuation.\n\nThe French government claimed that it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those it called \"repatriates\" to partly reimburse them for property losses. The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the \"Pieds-Noirs\" were alienated from both Algeria and France.\n\nMany \"Pieds-Noirs\" settled in continental France, while others migrated to New Caledonia, Australia, Spain, Israel, Argentina, In France, many relocated to the south, which offered a climate similar to North Africa. The influx of new citizens bolstered the local economies; however, the newcomers also competed for jobs, which caused resentment.; one unintended consequence with significant and ongoing political effects was the resentment caused by the state resettlement programme for Pieds-Noirs in rural Corsica, which triggered a cultural and political nationalist movement. In some ways, the \"Pieds-Noirs\" were able to integrate well into the French community, relative to their harki Muslim counterparts. Their resettlement was made easier by the economic boom of the 1960s. However, the ease of assimilation depended on socioeconomic class. Integration was easier for the upper classes, many of whom found the transformation less stressful than the lower classes, whose only capital had been left in Algeria when they fled. Many were surprised that they were often treated as an \"underclass or outsider-group\" with difficulties in gaining advancement in their careers. Also, many \"Pieds-Noirs\" contended that the money allocated by the government to assist in relocation and reimbursement was insufficient regarding their loss.\n\nThus, the repatriated \"Pieds-Noirs\" frequently felt \"disaffected\" from French society. They also suffered from a sense of alienation stemming from the French government's changed position towards Algeria. Until independence, Algeria was legally a part of France; after independence many felt that they had been betrayed and were now portrayed as an \"embarrassment\" to their country or to blame for the war. Most \"Pied-Noirs\" felt a powerful sense of loss and a longing for their lost homeland in Algeria. The American author Claire Messud remembered seeing her \"pied-noir\" father, a lapsed Catholic crying while watching Pope John Paul II deliver a Mass on his TV. When asked why, Messud \"père\" replied: “Because when I last heard the mass in Latin, I thought I had a religion, and I thought I had a country.” Messud noted that the novelist Albert Camus, himself a \"pied-noir\", had often written of his love for the sea-shores and mountains of Algeria, declaring Algeria was a place that was a part of his soul, feelings that she noted that mirrored those of other \"pied-noirs\" for whom Algeria was the only home they had ever known.\n\nThe \"Pied-Noir\" community has adopted, as both an unofficial anthem and as a symbol of its identity, Captain Félix Boyer's 1943 version of \"Le Chant des Africains\" (lit. \"The Song of the Africans\"). This was a 1915 \"Infanterie de Marine\" marching song, originally titled \"C'est nous les Marocains\" (lit. \"We are the Moroccans\") and dedicated to Colonel Van Hecke, commander of a World War I cavalry unit: the \"\" (\"7th African Light Cavalry Regiment\"). Boyer's song was adopted during World War II by the Free French First Army that was drawn from units of the Army of Africa and included many \"Pieds-Noirs\". The music and words were later utilized by the \"Pieds-Noirs\" to proclaim their allegiance to France. \n\nThe \"Song of the Africans\" was banned from use as official military music in 1962 at the end of the Algerian War until August 1969, when the French Minister of Veterans Affairs (\"Ministre des Anciens Combattants\") at the time, Henri Duvillard, lifted the prohibition.\n\n\n"}

As of 2014, 42% of those on death row in the United States were black. However, this is an under-representation relative to the proportion of convicted murderers; 52.5% of all homicide offenders between 1980 and 2008 were black.\nAccording to the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports, between the early 1960s and the late 1970s, the rate of homicides doubled. For every 100,000 U.S residents, the homicide victim rate elevated from 4.6 to 9.7.\nThe homicide victim rate per 100,000 U.S. residents has heightened at 10.2 in 1980 and dropped in 1984 to 7.9.\nIn 1992, homicide victim rate decreased drastically again from 9.3 to 4.8 in 2010. Since 1999 the rate of homicide victims have retained a steady range.\nThe number of homicides peaked at 24,703 in 1991 and then dwindled to 15,522 in 1999.\nThe rate of homicides consistently elevated between the years of 1950 and 1970.\nSince 1999 the rate of homicide victims have retained a steady range. In 1999, the rates were at 15,552 and slowly increased to 17,030. In comparison to the 24,703 disclosed in 1991, these numbers have gradually declined and become more consistent.\nIn 1983, David Baldus co-authored a study that found that capital punishment in Georgia since the decision in \"Furman v. Georgia\" was handed down 1972 had been applied unevenly across race. Specifically, his and his colleagues' study found that only 15 out of 246 murder cases (6%) where the victim was black resulted in a death sentence, as compared with 85 out of 348 (24%) of such cases when the victim was white. This study led to Warren McCleskey's death sentence being challenged due to allegations that it was racially biased. Those allegations resulted in the Supreme Court's 1987 decision in McCleskey v. Kemp that statistical evidence of bias in the criminal justice system is insufficient to overturn an individual's sentence. In 1998, Baldus published another study which concluded that black defendants in certain types of murder cases in Philadelphia were almost four times as likely to be sentenced to death than were their white counterparts.\n\nIn 1981, Gary Kleck published a literature review that declared that all states, except the Southern United States, found that African Americans were less likely than white Americans to be sentenced to death or executed. The review also found that cases with black victims were less likely than those with white victims to result in the death sentence, possibly as a result of the devaluing of black crime victims.\n\nA 1981 study by Michael Radelet found that murder cases involving white victims were more likely to result in a death sentence than were those involving black victims, mainly because those accused of murdering whites were more likely to be indicted for first-degree murder. The same study found that after controlling for the race of the victim, there was no clear evidence that the race of the defendant predicted how likely they were to receive a death sentence.\n\nA 1987 study by M. Dwayne Smith of Tulane University found a racial bias in capital punishment cases in Louisiana, but only with regard to the race of the victim, not the offender.\n\nA 1988 study by Sheldon Ekland-Olson found that in the first decade after \"Furman\", criminal cases in Texas involving white victims were more likely to result in a death sentence than those involving either black or Hispanic victims.\n\nA 1990 Government Accountability Office analysis of 28 studies, in 82% of these studies, found that murder cases with white victims were more likely than those with black victims to result in a death sentence. The report described this relationship as \"remarkably consistent across data sets, states, data collection methods,\nand analytic techniques.\"\n\nA 1995 study by Jonathan Sorensen and Donald H. Wallace found evidence of a racial bias in capital punishment in Missouri, mainly in regards to the race of the victim. The study found that cases with white victims were more likely to result in death sentences, and that cases with black victims were less likely to result in such sentences. The study also reported that these disparities were largest when \"prosecutors and jurors are freed from the seriousness of the cases to consider other factors.\" A 1999 study by the same authors found that murder cases with black defendants and white victims were more likely than those with any other combination of defendant and victim races to \"result in first-degree murder charges, to be served notice of aggravating circumstances, and to proceed to capital trial.\"\n\nA 2006 study led by Jennifer Eberhardt found that even after numerous other factors were controlled for, defendants who looked more stereotypically black in death penalty cases with white victims were more likely to be sentenced to death. People tend to see Black physical traits as directly related to criminality. The synthesis supported a strong race of victim influence.\n\nA 2014 study by Alberto Alesina and Eliana La Ferrara found evidence of racial bias in capital sentencing in that error rates tended to be higher in capital cases involving minority defendants and white victims. However, this pattern was only seen in Southern states.\n\n"}
{"id": "21244047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21244047", "title": "Realism (arts)", "text": "Realism (arts)\n\nRealism, sometimes called naturalism, in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.\n\nIn the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be \"realist\" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid. This is typical of the 19th-century Realist movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution, and also social realism, regionalism, or kitchen sink realism. The Realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.\n\nThere have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism, and Italian neorealist cinema. \n\nRealism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called naturalism, mimesis or illusionism. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization. It becomes especially marked in European painting in the Early Netherlandish painting of Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck and other artists in the 15th century. However such \"realism\" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century Realism art movement painters such as Gustave Courbet are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of academic painting, which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes. It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances. Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and \"veristic\" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between \"realistic\" (usually related to visual appearance) and \"realist\" is often useful, as is the term \"illusionistic\" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.\n\nThe development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art. It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of perspective and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The Art of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and Ancient Egyptian art developed conventions involving both stylization and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. Ancient Greek art is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in mosaic) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. Pliny the Elder's famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by Zeuxis in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective. This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly Socrates, were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. Roman portraiture, when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.\nThe art of Late Antiquity famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the Late medieval and Early Renaissance periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of oil painting which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze. Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, idealism remained the norm.\n\nThe accurate depiction of landscape in painting had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painting, with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. Still life paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked \"realism\", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of bouquets in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time. Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in Cubism.\n\nThe depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. Drolleries in the margins of medieval illuminated manuscripts sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.\n\nEarly Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of Flanders, and in some of these, notably the \"Arnolfini Portrait\" by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the Merode Altarpiece, by Robert Campin and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects. However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the Labours of the Months in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from books of hours, concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing landscape art and the depiction of everyday working-class people.\nIn the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included Pieter Aertsen and his nephew Joachim Beuckelaer in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young Annibale Carracci in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with Bartolomeo Passerotti somewhere between the two. Pieter Bruegel the Elder pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life. Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in genre painting in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with Dutch Golden Age painting sprouting several different subgenres of such scenes, the Bamboccianti (though mostly from the Low Countries) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of bodegones, and the introduction of unidealized peasants into history paintings by Jusepe de Ribera and Velázquez. The Le Nain brothers in France and many Flemish artists including Adriaen Brouwer and David Teniers the Elder and Younger painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.\n\nMuch art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of prints, was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message. From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as Gustave Doré to show the horrors of city slums. Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.\n\nMedieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of marine painting largely disappeared in fine art until the early Industrial Revolution, scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as Joseph Wright of Derby and Philip James de Loutherbourg. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few railway scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.\n\nAmerican realism, a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.\n\nThe Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to Romanticism and History painting. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were Gustave Courbet, Jean-François Millet, Honoré Daumier, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of Émile Zola, Honoré de Balzac, and Gustave Flaubert.\n\nThe French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular the Peredvizhniki or \"Wanderers\" group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as Ilya Repin, Vasily Perov, and Ivan Shishkin, and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as Hubert von Herkomer and Luke Fildes had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.\n\nRealism or naturalism as a style meaning the honest, unidealizing depiction of the subject, can be used in depicting any type of subject, without any commitment to treating the typical or everyday. Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and Baroque. Demetrius of Alopece was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the Ancient Roman Republic even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. Goya's portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.\nA recurring trend in Christian art was \"realism\" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all Christ and his physical sufferings in his Passion. Following trends in devotional literature, this developed in the Late Middle Ages, where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf. These were especially found in Germany and Central Europe. After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the Baroque, especially in Spanish sculpture.\n\nRenaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. Leonardo da Vinci was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things. Leon Battista Alberti was an early idealizer, stressing the typical, with others such as Michelangelo supporting selection of the most beautiful – he refused to make portraits for that reason.\nIn the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative \"classical-idealism\" of the Carracci and the \"naturalist\" style of the Caravaggisti, or followers of Caravaggio, who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used \"naturalist\" as a self-description. Bellori, writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to \"Those who glory in the name of naturalists\" (\"naturalisti\").\n\nIn the 19th century \"Naturalism\" or the \"Naturalist school\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of Natural history, as the biological sciences were then generally known. The originator of the term was the French art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary, who in 1863 announced that: \"The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science\". Émile Zola adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of Impressionism, but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.\n\nThe term \"continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism\" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of Modernism and also was not Academic art. The later periods of the French Barbizon School and the Düsseldorf school of painting, with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American Regionalism are movements which are often also described as \"Naturalist\", although the term is rarely used of British painting. Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.\n\nBroadly defined as \"the faithful representation of reality\", Realism as a literary movement was based on \"objective reality.\" It focused on showing everyday activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization. It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person objective reality, without embellishment or interpretation and \"in accordance with secular, empirical rules.\" As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such reality is ontologically independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As Ian Watt states, modern realism \"begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses\" and as such \"it has its origins in Descartes and Locke, and received its first full formulation by Thomas Reid in the middle of the eighteenth century.\"\n\nWhile the preceding Romantic era was also a reaction against the values of the Industrial Revolution, realism was in its turn a reaction to romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as \"traditional\" \"bourgeois realism\". Some writers of Victorian literature produced works of realism. The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of \"bourgeois realism,\" prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as modernism; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.\n\nTheatrical realism is said to have first emerged in European drama in the 19th century as an offshoot of the Industrial Revolution and the age of science. Some also specifically cited the invention of photography as the basis of the realist theater while others view that the association between realism and drama is far older as demonstrated by the principles of dramatic forms such as the presentation of the physical world that closely matches reality.\n\nThe achievement of realism in the theatre was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world. These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. Anton Chekov, for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected slice of life, exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality. Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of melodramatic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa.\n\nIn the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s. Its development is also attributed to William Dean Howells and Henry James who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles.\n\nThe realistic approach to theater collapsed into nihilism and the absurd after World War II. \n\nItalian Neorealism was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, and Roberto Rossellini. Realist films generally focus on social issues. There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a \"reality effect\" to maintain its authenticity. Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by Andre Bazin in the 1950s, acknowledges that a \"film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows\", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a \"preferred reading\". Siegfried Kracauer is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.\n\nAesthetic realist filmmakers use long shots, deep focus and eye-level 90 degree shots to reduce manipulation of what the viewer sees. Italian neorealism filmmakers from after WWII took the existing realist film approaches from France and Italy that emerged in the 1960s and used the to create a politically-oriented cinema. French filmmakers made some politically-oriented realist films in the 1960s, such as the cinéma vérité and documentary films of Jean Rouch. In the 1950s and 1960s, British, French and German new waves of filmmaking produced \"slice-of-life\" films (e.g., kitchen sink dramas in the UK).\n\nVerismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as Pietro Mascagni, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Umberto Giordano, Francesco Cilea and Giacomo Puccini. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as Émile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, and Henrik Ibsen into opera. This new style presented true-to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event. Although an account considered Giuseppe Verdi's \"Luisa Miller\" and \"La Traviata\" as the first stirrings of the verismo, some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", peaked in the early 1900s. It was followed by Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which dealt with the themes of infidelity, revenge, and violence.\n\nVerismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the Victorian-era theatrical partnership of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842–1900). Specifically, their play \"Iolanthe\" is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

Along with the Willie Horton \"Weekend Passes\" advertisement, it is considered to be a prime factor in George H.W. Bush's defeat of Michael Dukakis. The ad was produced by political consultant Roger Ailes with help by Lee Atwater, and first aired on October 5, 1988. \"Revolving door syndrome\" is a term used in criminology to refer to recidivism; however, in the ad, the implication is that prison sentences were of an inconsequential length.\n\nThe ad shows a line of convicts (portrayed by actors) casually walking in and out of a prison (filmed in Draper, Utah) by means of a revolving door. The narration states that as governor of Massachusetts, Dukakis vetoed mandatory minimum sentencing for drug dealers, that he vetoed the death penalty, and that he gave weekend furloughs to first-degree murderers. The narrator goes on to point out that while furloughed, many of the convicts committed crimes including kidnapping and rape, and are still at large. The ad concludes with the phrase: \"Now Michael Dukakis says he wants to do for America what he's done for Massachusetts. America can't afford that risk.\" The disclaimer at the end indicates the ad was paid for and endorsed by the Bush/Quayle campaign.\n\nA CBS News/New York Times poll showed that of all of the political ads of the 1988 presidential campaign, this one had the greatest impact on respondents. The percentage of poll respondents who felt Bush was \"tough enough\" on crime rose from 23 percent in July 1988 to 61 percent in late October 1988 while the proportion saying Dukakis was \"not tough enough\" on crime rose from 36 to 49 percent during the same period.\n\nWomen particularly were affected by the ad. Said Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich, \"The symbolism was very powerful...you can't find a stronger metaphor, intended or not, for racial hatred in this country than a black man raping a white woman...I talked to people afterward...Women said they couldn't help it, but it scared the living daylights out of them.\"\n\nThe original State inmate furlough program, for which convicted first-degree murderers were ineligible, was actually signed into law by Republican Governor Francis W. Sargent in 1972. After the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that this right extended to first-degree murderers, the Massachusetts legislature quickly passed a bill prohibiting furloughs for such inmates. However, in 1976, Dukakis vetoed this bill. The program remained in effect through the intervening term of governor Edward J. King and was abolished during Dukakis' final term of office on April 28, 1988. This abolition only occurred after the \"Lawrence Eagle Tribune\" had run 175 stories about the furlough program and won a Pulitzer Prize. Dukakis continued to argue that the program was 99 percent effective; yet, as the \"Lawrence Eagle Tribune\" pointed out, no state outside of Massachusetts, nor any federal program, would grant a furlough to a prisoner serving life without parole.\n\nIn the 2014 Illinois governors' race, Republican gubernatorial candidate (and eventual governor) Bruce Rauner created an attack ad entitled \"Unthinkable,\" alleging that then-governor Pat Quinn \"secretly\" released 230+ violent offenders early, such as wife-beaters, rapists, sex offenders, and murderers. The ad went on to say that the consequences were \"unthinkable\": sexual assault of a minor, aggravated assaults, domestic abuse, and more murders. The video ends with the voiceover saying \"Now Pat Quinn Wants Four More Years?\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5572410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5572410", "title": "Sabantuy", "text": "Sabantuy\n\nSabantuy is a Bashkir, Idel-Uralian and Tatar summer festival, that dates back to the Volga Bulgarian epoch. At first Sabantuy was a festival of farmers in rural areas, but it later became a national holiday and now is widely celebrated in the cities. In 2012, Kazan Sabantuy was celebrated on June 23.\n\nTatar-speakers call the holiday \"Sabantuy\" (Сабантуй, ), or, more correctly, Saban tuyı (Сабан туе, ) - plural form: \"Sabantuylar\" .\n\nOther Turkic peoples living along the Volga also celebrate the holiday. Bashkir-speakers call it Habantuy (Һабантуй), Chuvash-speakers — Akatuy (Акатуй).\n\nThe holiday's name means \"plough's feast\" in Turkic languages. The synonym \"plough's holiday\", or Saban bäyräme (Сабан бәйрәме ) also occurs.\n\nSabantuy traces its origins to the pre-Islamic epoch, when it was celebrated before the sowing season. The presence of Sabantuy was noticed by ibn Fadlan as early as in 921. Traditional songs and other customs of the Sabantuy probably had a religious connotation at that time. \n\nLater, with the spread of Islam among Tatars and Bashkirs and Christianity among Chuvashs, it became a secular holiday. In each region, villages took turns to celebrate the holiday.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century Sabantuy gained recognition as the national festival of the Tatars. The Soviet authorities approved of this festival probably due to its humble rural origin. However, they moved Sabantuy to the after-sowing season, thus merging it with the ancient summer festival \"Cıyın\" (Cyrillic: Җыен, ). \n\nRecently, Moscow announced plans to nominate Sabantuy for the inclusion into the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity list in 2007.\n\nThe main distinctive elements of Sabantuy include the traditional sporting competitions such as \"köräş\" (Tatar wrestling), horse racing, race-in-sack, pillar-climbing, egg-in-spoon-in-mouth-racing, sacks-battle on the crossbar, pot smashing , finding a coin in a \"qatıq\" (a beverage made from sour milk), and other contests. Such activities take place on the \"mäydan\", which would usually be located at the edge of a forest.\n\nA tradition, called \"sörän\", was held to collect a fare for guests of the festival and prizes for the winners of the contests. \"Qarğa botqası\" (Rook's porridge), a ritual porridge, was cooked before the Sabantuy to treat children in the village. Another tradition was praying at the cemetery.\n\nIn the recent years Sabantuy is also often combined with the folk and pop music festivals, as well as accordion music festivals, named \"Play, accordion!\" (\"Uyna, ğarmun!\").\n\nThe wrestling Kurash, is the main competition of Sabantuy. Wrestlers use towels and the aim is to knock down the opponent.\n\nUsually young boys start the competition. At the end of Sabantuy, the main event of the festival is the final of köräş. The winner becomes the \"batır,\" the hero of the Sabantuy. The prize varies from a ram in small villages to a car at big cities' celebrations.\n\nSabantuylar do not have a set date. The festivities take place approximately from June 15 to July 1, and usually fall on a Sunday. Initially, Sabantuylar are arranged in villages, followed by Sabantuylar in rural districts, and the final ones taking place in major cities. The last Sabantuy is held in Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan. A similar schedule is applied for Akatuy in Chuvashia and Habantuy in Bashkortostan.\n\nIn the last few years the Russian government arranged federal Sabantuylar in Moscow. Many cities in Europe and Asia that have major Tatar diasporas, such as Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tallinn, Prague, Istanbul, Kiev and Tashkent, also hold Sabantuylar.\n\nToday Sabantuy can be characterized as an international festival attracting many people of various ethnicities who participate in Sabanuylar, both in Tatarstan, and all over the world.\n\nSabantuy is a symbol of Tatarstan. This is why every Russian president visiting the republic takes part in the Sabantuy held in Kazan. During his visit to Kazan in the mid-1990s Boris Yeltsin became the center of attention at a Sabantuy when he took part in a traditional competition in which the participants try to crash a clay pot while being blindfolded. Vladimir Putin took part in a humorous competition during which he tried to dip his face into a jar full of sour milk in order to fish out a coin without using his hands.\n\n"}
{"id": "13118744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13118744", "title": "Scientology", "text": "Scientology\n\nScientology is a body of religious beliefs and practices launched in May 1952 by American author L. Ron Hubbard (1911–86). Hubbard initially developed a program of ideas called Dianetics, which was distributed through the Dianetics Foundation. The foundation soon entered bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost the rights to his seminal publication \"\" in 1952. He then recharacterized the subject as a religion and renamed it Scientology, retaining the terminology, doctrines, the E-meter, and the practice of auditing. Within a year, he regained the rights to Dianetics and retained both subjects under the umbrella of the Church of Scientology.\n\nHubbard describes the etymology of the word Scientology as coming from the Latin word \"scio\", meaning know or distinguish, and the Greek word \"logos\", meaning \"the word or outward form by which the inward thought is expressed and made known\". Hubbard writes, \"thus, Scientology means knowing about knowing, or science of knowledge\".\n\nHubbard's groups have encountered considerable opposition and controversy. In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners brought proceedings against Dianetics Foundation on the charge of teaching medicine without a license. Hubbard's followers engaged in a program of criminal infiltration of the U.S. government.\n\nHubbard-inspired organizations and their classification are often a point of contention. Germany classifies Scientology groups as an \"anti-constitutional sect\". In France, they have been classified as a dangerous cult by some parliamentary reports.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard (1911–1986) was the only child of Harry Ross Hubbard, a United States Navy officer, and his wife, Ledora Waterbury. Hubbard spent three semesters at George Washington University but was placed on probation in September 1931. He failed to return for the fall 1932 semester.\n\nIn July 1941, Hubbard was commissioned as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve. On May 18, 1943, his subchaser left Portland. That night, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds at what he believed were Japanese submarines. His ship sustained minor damage and three crew were injured. Having run out of depth charges and with the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by other ships, Hubbard's ship was ordered back to port. A navy report concluded that \"there was no submarine in the area.\" A decade later, Hubbard claimed in his Scientology lectures that he had sunk a Japanese submarine.\n\nOn June 28, 1943, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire on the Coronado Islands. Hubbard apparently did not realize that the islands belonged to US-allied Mexico, nor that he had taken his vessel into Mexican territorial waters. He was reprimanded and removed from command on July 7. After reassignment to a naval facility in Monterey, California, Hubbard became depressed and fell ill. Reporting stomach pains in April 1945, he spent the remainder of the war as a patient in Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. According to his later teachings, during this time Hubbard made scientific \"breakthroughs\" by use of \"endocrine experiments\".\n\nOn October 15, 1947, Hubbard wrote a letter to the Veterans Administration formally requesting psychiatric treatment, but admitted that he was unable to afford it. Within a few years, Hubbard would condemn psychiatry as evil, which would grow into a major theme in Scientology.\n\nIn April 1938, Hubbard reportedly reacted to a drug used in a dental procedure. According to his account, this triggered a revelatory near-death experience. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with the working titles of \"The One Command\" or \"Excalibur\". The contents of \"Excalibur\" formed the basis for some of his later publications. Arthur J. Burks, who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the \"one command\": to survive. This theme would be revisited in Dianetics, the set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body which became the central philosophy of Scientology. Hubbard later cited \"Excalibur\" as an early version of Dianetics.\n\nIn August 1945, Hubbard moved into the Pasadena mansion of John \"Jack\" Whiteside Parsons, an avid occultist and Thelemite, follower of the English ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley and leader of a lodge of Crowley's magical order, Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO). Parsons and Hubbard collaborated on the \"Babalon Working\", a sex magic ritual intended to summon an incarnation of Babalon, the supreme Thelemite Goddess. The Church of Scientology admits to Hubbard's involvement with Parsons while claiming that it was for the purpose of naval intelligence.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Hubbard practiced as a hypnotist and he worked in Hollywood posing as a swami. The Church says that Hubbard's experience with hypnosis led him to create Dianetics.\n\nIn May 1950, Hubbard's \"\" was published by pulp magazine \"Astounding Science Fiction\". In the same year, he published the book-length \",\" considered the seminal event of the century by Scientologists. Scientologists sometimes use a dating system based on the book's publication; for example, \"A.D. 25\" does not stand for \"Anno Domini\", but \"After Dianetics\".\n\nDianetics uses a counseling technique known as auditing in which an auditor assists a subject in conscious recall of traumatic events in the individual's past. It was originally intended to be a new psychotherapy and was not expected to become the foundation for a new religion. Hubbard variously defined Dianetics as a spiritual healing technology and an organized science of thought. The stated intent is to free individuals of the influence of past traumas by systematic exposure and removal of the engrams (painful memories) these events have left behind, a process called \"clearing\". Rutgers scholar Beryl Satter says that \"there was little that was original in Hubbard's approach\", with much of the theory having origins in popular conceptions of psychology. Satter observes that in \"keeping with the typical 1950s distrust of emotion, Hubbard promised that Dianetic treatment would release and erase psychosomatic ills and painful emotions, thereby leaving individuals with increased powers of rationality.\" According to Gallagher and Ashcraft, in contrast to psychotherapy, Hubbard stated that Dianetics \"was more accessible to the average person, promised practitioners more immediate progress, and placed them in control of the therapy process.\" Hubbard's thought was parallel with the trend of humanist psychology at that time, which also came about in the 1950s. Passas and Castillo write that the appeal of Dianetics was based on its consistency with prevailing values. Shortly after the introduction of Dianetics, Hubbard introduced the concept of the \"thetan\" (or soul) which he claimed to have discovered. Dianetics was organized and centralized to consolidate power under Hubbard, and groups that were previously recruited were no longer permitted to organize autonomously.\n\nTwo of Hubbard's key supporters at the time were John W. Campbell Jr., the editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\", and Campbell's brother-in-law, physician Joseph A. Winter. Dr. Winter, hoping to have Dianetics accepted in the medical community, submitted papers outlining the principles and methodology of Dianetic therapy to the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" and the \"American Journal of Psychiatry\" in 1949, but these were rejected.\n\n\"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\" spent six months on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. According to religious studies professor Paul Gutjahr, Dianetics is the bestselling non-Christian religious book of the century. Publisher's Weekly gave a posthumous plaque to Hubbard to commemorate Dianetics' appearance on its list of bestsellers for one hundred weeks. Studies that address the topic of the origins of the work and its significance to Scientology as a whole include Peter Rowley's \"New Gods in America\", Omar V. Garrison's \"The Hidden Story of Scientology\", and Albert I. Berger's \"Towards a Science of the Nuclear Mind: Science-fiction Origins of Dianetics\". More complex studies include Roy Wallis's \"The Road to Total Freedom\".\n\nDianetics appealed to a broad range of people who used instructions from the book and applied the method to each other, becoming practitioners themselves. Dianetics soon met with criticism. Morris Fishbein, the editor of the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" and well-known at the time as a debunker of quack medicine, dismissed Hubbard's book. An article in Newsweek stated that \"the Dianetics concept is unscientific and unworthy of discussion or review\". Hubbard asserted that Dianetics is \"an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of natural laws on the order of those of the physical sciences.\"\n\nHubbard became the leader of a growing Dianetics movement. He became a popular lecturer and established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he trained his first Dianetics counselors or \"auditors\". \n\nSome practitioners of Dianetics reported experiences which they believed had occurred in past lives, or previous incarnations. In early 1951, reincarnation became a subject of intense debate within the Dianetics community. Hubbard took the reports of past life events seriously and introduced the concept of the \"thetan\", an immortal being analogous to the soul. This was an important factor in the transition from secular Dianetics to the religion of Scientology. Sociologists Roy Wallis and Steve Bruce suggest that Dianetics, which set each person as his or her own authority, was about to fail due to its inherent individualism, and that Hubbard started Scientology as a religion to establish himself as the overarching authority.\n\nAlso in 1951, Hubbard incorporated the \"electropsychometer\" (E-meter for short), a kind of electrodermal activity meter, as an auditing aid. Based on a design by Volney Mathison, the device is held by Scientologists to be a useful tool in detecting changes in a person's state of mind. The global spread of Scientology at the latter half of the 1950s was culminated with the opening of churches in Johannesburg and Paris, while world headquarters transferred to England in Saint Hill, a rural estate. Hubbard lived there for the next seven years.\n\nDianetics is different from Scientology in that Scientology is a religion while Dianetics is not. The purpose of Dianetics is the improvement of the individual, the individual or \"self\" being only one of eight \"dynamics.\" \"According to Hugh B. Urban, Hubbard's early science of Dianetics would be best comprehended as a \"bricolage that brought together his various explorations in psychology, hypnosis, and science fiction.\" If Dianetics is understood as a bricolage, then Scientology is \"an even more ambitious sort of religious bricolage adapted to the new religious marketplace of 1950s America,\" continues Urban. According to Roy Wallis, \"Scientology emerged as a religious commodity eminently suited to the contemporary market of postwar America.\" L. Ron Hubbard Jr. said in an interview that the spiritual bricolage of Scientology, as written by Hugh B. Urban, \"seemed to be uniquely suited to the individualism and quick-fix mentality of 1950s America: just by doing a few assignments, \"one can become a god.\" \n\nHarlan Ellison has told a story of seeing Hubbard at a gathering of the Hydra Club in 1953 or 1954. Hubbard was complaining of not being able to make a living on what he was being paid as a science fiction writer. Ellison says that Lester del Rey told Hubbard that what he needed to do to get rich was start a religion.\n\nIn January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners began proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for teaching medicine without a license, which eventually led to that foundation's bankruptcy. In December 1952, the Hubbard Dianetic Foundation filed for bankruptcy, and Hubbard lost control of the Dianetics trademark and copyrights to financier Don Purcell. Author Russell Miller argues that Scientology \"was a development of undeniable expedience, since it ensured that he would be able to stay in business even if the courts eventually awarded control of Dianetics and its valuable copyrights to ... Purcell\".\n\nL. Ron Hubbard originally intended for Scientology to be considered a science, as stated in his writings. In May 1952, Scientology was organized to put this intended science into practice, and in the same year, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as \"Scientology, a religious philosophy.\" Marco Frenschkowski quotes Hubbard in a letter written in 1953, to show that he never denied that his original approach was not a religious one: \"Probably the greatest discovery of Scientology and its most forceful contribution to mankind has been the isolation, description and handling of the human spirit, accomplished in July, 1951, in Phoenix, Arizona. I established, along scientific rather than religious or humanitarian lines that the thing which is the person, the personality, is separable from the body and the mind at will and without causing bodily death or derangement. (Hubbard 1983: 55).\"\n\nIn April 1953, Hubbard wrote a letter proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion. As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in \"Dianetics\". His letter discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status. Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of \"Spiritual Guidance Centers\" charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing (\"That is real money ... Charge enough and we'd be swamped.\"). He wrote:\n\nIn December 1953, Hubbard incorporated three churches – a \"Church of American Science\", a \"Church of Scientology\" and a \"Church of Spiritual Engineering\" – in Camden, New Jersey. On February 18, 1954, with Hubbard's blessing, some of his followers set up the first local Church of Scientology, the Church of Scientology of California, adopting the \"aims, purposes, principles and creed of the Church of American Science, as founded by L. Ron Hubbard.\" The movement spread quickly through the United States and to other English-speaking countries such as Britain, Ireland, South Africa and Australia. The second local Church of Scientology to be set up, after the one in California, was in Auckland, New Zealand. In 1955, Hubbard established the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.C.. The group declared that the Founding Church, as written in the certificate of incorporation for the Founding Church of Scientology in the District of Columbia, was to \"act as a parent church for the religious faith known as 'Scientology' and to act as a church for the religious worship of the faith.\"\n\nThe Church experienced further challenges. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began an investigation concerning the claims the Church of Scientology made in connection with its E-meters. On January 4, 1963, FDA agents raided offices of the Church of Scientology, seizing hundreds of E-meters as illegal medical devices and tons of literature that they accused of making false medical claims. The original suit by the FDA to condemn the literature and E-meters did not succeed, but the Court ordered the Church to label every meter with a disclaimer that it is purely religious artifact, to post a $20,000 bond of compliance, and to pay the FDA's legal expenses.\n\nIn the course of developing Scientology, Hubbard presented rapidly changing teachings that some have seen as often self-contradictory. According to Lindholm, for the inner cadre of Scientologists in that period, involvement depended not so much on belief in a particular doctrine but on unquestioning faith in Hubbard.\n\nIn 1966, Hubbard purportedly stepped down as executive director of Scientology to devote himself to research and writing. The following year, he formed the ship-based Sea Organization or Sea Org which operated three ships: the \"Diana\", the \"Athena\", and the flagship the \"Apollo\". One month after the establishment of the Sea Org, Hubbard announced that he had made a breakthrough discovery, the result of which were the \"OT III\" materials purporting to provide a method for overcoming factors inhibiting spiritual progress. These materials were first disseminated on the ships, and then propagated by Sea Org members reassigned to staff Advanced Organizations on land.\n\nIn 1972, facing criminal charges in France, Hubbard returned to the United States and began living in an apartment in Queens, New York. When faced with possible indictment in the United States, Hubbard went into hiding in April 1979. He hid first in an apartment in Hemet, California, where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted Messengers. He cut contact with everyone else, even his wife, whom he saw for the last time in August 1979. In February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted Messengers, Pat and Anne Broeker.\n\nIn 1979, as a result of FBI raids during Operation Snow White, eleven senior people in the church's Guardian's Office were convicted of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. In 1981, Scientology took the German government to court for the first time.\n\nOn January 24, 1986, L. Ron Hubbard died at his ranch in Creston, California. David Miscavige emerged as the new head of the organization.\n\nWhile \"Scientology\" generally refers to Miscavige-led Church of Scientology, other groups practice Scientology. These groups, collectively known as Independent Scientologists, consist of former members of the official Church of Scientology as well as entirely new members.\n\nIn 1950, founding member Joseph Winter cut ties with Hubbard and set up a private Dianetics practice in New York. In 1965, a longtime Church member and \"Doctor of Scientology\" Jack Horner (born 1927), dissatisfied with the Church's \"ethics\" program, developed Dianology. Capt. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s. The church labels these groups \"squirrels\" (Scientology jargon) and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.\n\nOn January 1, 1982, Miscavige established the Religious Technology Center (RTC). On November 11, 1982, the Free Zone was established by top Scientologists in disagreement with RTC. The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and espouses the doctrine that the official Church of Scientology led by David Miscavige has departed from Hubbard's original philosophy.\n\nThe Advanced Ability Center was established by Hubbard's personal auditor David Mayo after February 1983 – a time when some of Scientology's upper and middle management split with Miscavige's organization.\n\nMore recently, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder have championed the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church.\n\nAccording to Scientology, its beliefs and practices are based on rigorous research, and its doctrines are accorded a significance equivalent to scientific laws. Scientology cosmology is, however, at odds with modern science, with claims of memories going back \"76 trillion years\": much longer than the age of the universe. Blind belief is held to be of lesser significance than the practical application of Scientologist methods. Adherents are encouraged to validate the practices through their personal experience. Hubbard put it this way: \"For a Scientologist, the final test of any knowledge he has gained is, 'did the data and the use of it in life actually improve conditions or didn't it? He defined Scientology's aims as: \"A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war; where the world can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology.\" He described Scientology as an \"applied religious philosophy\" because, according to him, it consists of a metaphysical doctrine, a theory of psychology, and teachings in morality. The core of Scientology teaching lies in the belief that \"each human has a reactive mind that responds to life's traumas, clouding the analytic mind and keeping us from experiencing reality.\" Scientologists undergo auditing to discover sources of this trauma, believing that re-experiencing it neutralizes it and reinforces the ascendancy of the analytic mind, with the final goal believed to be achieving a spiritual state that Scientology calls \"clear.\"\n\nScientology does not preach or impose a particular idea of God on Scientologists. Rather, people are expected to discover the truth through their own observations as their awareness advances... the Church of Scientology has no set dogma concerning God that it imposes on its members. As with all its tenets, Scientology does not ask individuals to accept anything on faith alone. Rather, as one's level of spiritual awareness increases through participation in Scientology \"auditing\" and \"training\", one attains his own certainty of every dynamic. Accordingly, only when the Seventh Dynamic (spiritual) is reached in its entirety will one discover and come to a full understanding of the Eighth Dynamic (infinity) and one's relationship to the Supreme Being.\n\nMany Scientologists avoid using the words \"belief\" or \"faith\" to describe how Hubbard's teachings impacts their lives. They perceive that Scientology is based on verifiable technologies, speaking to Hubbard's original scientific objectives for Dianetics, based on the quantifiability of auditing on the E-meter. Scientologists call Dianetics and Scientology as technologies because of their claim of their scientific precision and workability.\n\nScientology presents two major divisions of the mind. The \"reactive mind\" is thought to record all pain and emotional trauma, while the \"analytical mind\" is a rational mechanism that serves consciousness. The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these are referred to as \"engrams\". Engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity. To avoid this fate is Scientology's basic goal. Some engrams are taught by Hubbard to happen by accident while others are inflicted by \"thetans who have gone bad and want power,\" as described by the Los Angeles Times. These engrams are named Implants in the doctrine of Scientology. Hubbard said, \"Implants result in all varieties of illness, apathy, degradation, neurosis and insanity and are the principal cause of these in man.\"\n\nL. Ron Hubbard described the analytical mind in terms of a computer: \"the analytical mind is not just a good computer, it is a perfect computer.\" According to him it makes the best decisions based on available data. Errors are made based on erroneous data, and is not the error of the analytical mind.\n\nDianetic auditing is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the \"Clear\" state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind's engrams and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan. David V. Barrett, a sociologist of religion who has written widely about the subject, says that according to Scientology, the \"first major goal is to go Clear.\" Clearing was described to represent \"the attainment of Man's dreams through the ages of attaining a new and higher state of existence and freedom from the endless cycle of birth, death, birth … Clear is the total erasure of the reactive mind from which stems all the anxieties and problems the individual has.\"\n\nScientology asserts that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized. It teaches that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as \"auditing\". Through auditing, people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams. This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be \"at cause\" in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams. Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of \"Preclear\" to \"Clear\" and \"Operating Thetan\". Scientology's utopian aim is to \"clear the planet\", that is, clear all people in the world of their engrams.\n\nAuditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or \"auditor.\" It is similar to confession or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice as a pastor or priest of another religion might do. Instead, the auditor's task is to help a person discover and understand the universal principles of affinity, reality, and communication (ARC). Most auditing requires an E-meter, a device that measures minute changes in electrical resistance through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal \"cans\"), and a small current is passed through them.\n\nScientology teaches that the E-meter helps to locate spiritual difficulties. Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it to help him or her eliminate the difficulty, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the \"charge\" has been dissipated. As the individual progresses up the \"Bridge to Total Freedom\", the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity and other difficulties. At the more advanced OT levels, Scientologists act as their own auditors (\"solo auditors\").\n\nDouglas E. Cowan writes that the e-meter \"provides an external, material locus for the legitimation of [Scientology] practice.\" Scientologists depend on the \"appearance of objectivity or empirical validity\" of the e-meter rather than simply trusting an auditor's abstract interpretation of a participant's statements. He also states that without the e-meter, \"Scientology could not have achieved whatever status it enjoys as a new religious movement.\" He also argues that without it, the Church may not have survived the early years when Dianetics was just formed.\n\nScientology uses an emotional classification system called the \"tone scale\". The tone scale is a tool used in auditing; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person's place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering his or her condition.\n\nScientology emphasizes the importance of \"survival\", which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as \"dynamics\". An individual's desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family. The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being. The optimum solution to any problem is held to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics.\n\nThe Purification Rundown is a controversial \"detoxification\" program used by the Church of Scientology as an introductory service. It features high-dose dietary supplements and extended time in a sauna (up to five hours a day for five weeks). Scientology claims it is the only effective way to deal with the long-term effects of drug abuse or toxic exposure.\n\nNarconon is a \"drug education and rehabilitation program\" founded on Hubbard's beliefs about \"toxins\" and \"purification\". Narconon is offered in the United States, Canada and a number of European countries; its \"Purification Program\" also uses high-dose vitamins and extended sauna sessions, combined with auditing and study.\n\nThe Introspection Rundown is a controversial Church of Scientology auditing process that is intended to handle a psychotic episode or complete mental breakdown. Introspection is defined for the purpose of this rundown as a condition where the person is \"looking into one's own mind, feelings, reactions, etc.\" The Introspection Rundown came under public scrutiny after the death of Lisa McPherson in 1995.\n\nScientology is vehemently opposed to psychiatry and psychology. Psychiatry rejected Hubbard's theories in the early 1950s and in 1951, Hubbard's wife Sara consulted doctors who recommended he \"be committed to a private sanatorium for psychiatric observation and treatment of a mental ailment known as paranoid schizophrenia.\" Thereafter, Hubbard criticized psychiatry as a \"barbaric and corrupt profession\".\n\nHubbard taught that psychiatrists were responsible for a great many wrongs in the world, saying that psychiatry has at various times offered itself as a tool of political suppression and \"that psychiatry spawned the ideology which fired Hitler's mania, turned the Nazis into mass murderers, and created the Holocaust.\" Hubbard created the anti-psychiatry organization Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), which operates , an anti-psychiatry museum.\n\nFrom 1969, CCHR has campaigned in opposition to psychiatric treatments, electroconvulsive shock therapy, lobotomy, and drugs such as Ritalin and Prozac. According to the official church website, \"the effects of medical and psychiatric drugs, whether painkillers, tranquilizers or 'antidepressants', are as disastrous\" as illegal drugs.\n\nScientology beliefs revolve around the immortal soul, the \"thetan\". Scientology teaches that the thetan is the true identity of a person – an intrinsically good, omniscient, non-material core capable of unlimited creativity.\n\nHubbard taught that thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure. The universe has no independent reality, but derives its apparent reality from the fact that thetans agree it exists. Thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation rather than their original state of spiritual purity. Eventually they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.\n\nThetans are reborn time and time again in new bodies through a process called \"assumption\" which is analogous to reincarnation. Scientology posits a causal relationship between the experiences of earlier incarnations and one's present life, and with each rebirth, the effects of the \"MEST\" universe (MEST here stands for matter, energy, space, and time) on the thetan become stronger.\n\nThe Church of Scientology holds that at the higher levels of initiation (\"OT levels\"), mystical teachings are imparted that may be harmful to unprepared readers. These teachings are kept secret from members who have not reached these levels. The church says that the secrecy is warranted to keep its materials' use in context and to protect its members from being exposed to materials they are not yet prepared for.\n\nThese are the OT levels, the levels above \"Clear\", whose contents are guarded within Scientology. The OT level teachings include accounts of various cosmic catastrophes that befell the thetans. Hubbard described these early events collectively as \"space opera\".\n\nIn the OT levels, Hubbard explains how to reverse the effects of past-life trauma patterns that supposedly extend millions of years into the past. Among these advanced teachings is the story of Xenu (sometimes Xemu), introduced as the tyrant ruler of the \"Galactic Confederacy\". According to this story, 75 million years ago Xenu brought billions of people to Earth in spacecraft resembling Douglas DC-8 airliners, stacked them around volcanoes and detonated hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes. The thetans then clustered together, stuck to the bodies of the living, and continue to do this today. Scientologists at advanced levels place considerable emphasis on isolating body thetans and neutralizing their ill effects.\n\nExcerpts and descriptions of OT materials were published online by a former member in 1995 and then circulated in mainstream media. This occurred after the teachings were submitted as evidence in court cases involving Scientology, thus becoming a matter of public record. There are eight publicly known OT levels, OT I to VIII. The highest level, OT VIII, is disclosed only at sea on the Scientology cruise ship \"Freewinds\". It has been rumored that additional OT levels, said to be based on material written by Hubbard long ago, will be released at some appropriate point in the future.\n\nA large Church of Spiritual Technology symbol carved into the ground at Scientology's Trementina Base is visible from the air. Washington Post reporter Richard Leiby wrote, \"Former Scientologists familiar with Hubbard's teachings on reincarnation say the symbol marks a 'return point' so loyal staff members know where they can find the founder's works when they travel here in the future from other places in the universe.\"\n\nThe \"Ethics\" system regulates member behavior, and \"Ethics officers\" are present in every Scientology organization. \"Ethics\" officers ensure \"correct application of Scientology technology\" and deal with \"behavior adversely affecting a Scientology organization's performance\", ranging from \"Errors\" and \"Misdemeanors\" to \"Crimes\" and \"Suppressive Acts\", as those terms defined by Scientology.\n\nScientology asserts some people are truly malevolent, and Hubbard taught 20 percent of the population were \"suppressive persons\", which includes some hopelessly antisocial personalities who are the truly dangerous individuals in humanity: \"the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords.\" Scientology disconnection policy prohibits most contact with Suppressive Persons. The church denies that a disconnection policy exists, and quotes Hubbard's definition of disconnection as \"a self-determined decision made by an individual that he is not going to be connected to another.\"\n\nA Scientologist who communicates with a suppressive person risks being declared a \"Potential Trouble Source\". Defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons, and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors.\n\nThe term \"Fair Game\" is used to describe policies and practices carried out against people the Church perceives as its enemies. Hubbard established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization. Individuals or groups who are \"Fair Game\" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible.\n\nHubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a program of illegal infiltration of the IRS and other U.S. government agencies during the 1970s. They also conducted private investigations, character assassination and legal action against the Church's critics in the media. The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.\n\nIn Scientology, ceremonies for events such as weddings, child naming, and funerals are observed. Friday services are held to commemorate the completion of a person's religious services during the prior week. Ordained Scientology ministers may perform such rites. However, these services and the clergy who perform them play only a minor role in Scientologists' religious lives.\n\nHubbard theorized in 1951 that the \"aesthetic mind\" is a phase of mental activity that \"deals with the nebulous field of art and creation.\" In August 1965, Hubbard published the book \"Art\" that defines art as \"a word which summarizes the quality of communication.\" He also claimed that art is \"the least codified of human endeavors and the most misunderstood.\" The book is used as a textbook for art courses in Scientology.\n\nThe internal structure of Scientology organizations is strongly bureaucratic with a focus on statistics-based management. Organizational operating budgets are performance-related and subject to frequent reviews.\n\nA 2001 survey estimated that 55,000 people in the United States claimed to be Scientologists. Worldwide estimates of Scientology's core practicing membership ranges between 100,000 and 200,000, mostly in the U.S., Europe, South Africa and Australia. The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey found that the number of American Scientologists had dropped to 25,000. A 2008 Trinity College survey concluded there were only 25,000 American Scientologists. Scientology is also declining in the United Kingdom. In 2011, High-level defector Jeff Hawkins estimated there were 40,000 Scientologists worldwide.\n\nAlthough the Church of Scientology claims to be the fastest growing religious movement on Earth, the church's estimates of its membership numbers are reportedly significantly exaggerated.\n\nThe highest ranking people in the Scientology hierarchy are the members of the Sea Organization, or Sea Org. The organization includes some 5,000 of Scientology's most dedicated adherents, who work for low pay, and sign a billion-year contract.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) is a controversial part of the Scientology \"justice\" system. When Sea Org members are found guilty of a violation, they are assigned to the RPF. The RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep. Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley state that scholars and observers have come to radically different conclusions about the RPF and whether it is \"voluntary or coercive, therapeutic or punitive\".\n\nThe Office of Special Affairs or \"OSA\" (formerly the \"Guardian's Office\") is a department of the Church of Scientology which has been characterized as a non-state intelligence agency. It has targeted critics of the Church for \"dead agent\" operations, which is mounting character assassination operations against perceived enemies.\n\nA 1990 article in the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that in the 1980s the church more commonly used private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers, to give themselves a layer of protection in case embarrassing tactics were used and became public.\n\nThe Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) has been described as \"most secret organization in all of Scientology.\" The organization owns the copyrights to all Scientology materials and the bulk of Hubbard's estate. CST licenses this intellectual property to the Religious Technology Center who then sub-licenses it to Church of Scientology International.\n\nThe organization also operates the Scientology archiving project, which aims to preserve the works of Hubbard on stainless steel tablets, encased in titanium capsules in specially constructed vaults throughout the world.\n\nShelly Miscavige, wife of leader David Miscavige, who hasn't been seen in public since 2007, is said to be held at a CST compound in Twin Peaks, California.\n\nMany Scientologists' first contact with Scientology is through local informal groups and field auditors practicing Dianetics counseling. In addition to these, Scientology operates hundreds of Churches and Missions around the world. This is where Scientologists receive introductory training, and it is at this local level that most Scientologists participate. Churches and Missions are licensed franchises; they may offer services for a fee provided they contribute a proportion of their income and comply with the Religious Technology Center (RTC) and its standards.\n\nOperating Thetan levels are offered only at Scientology's Advanced Organizations (Los Angeles, Sydney, East Grinstead and Copenhagen). The Flag Service Organization in Clearwater, Florida offers OT levels VI and VII. The Scientology ship \"Freewinds\" offers OT VIII.\n\nIn 1955, Hubbard created a list of 63 celebrities targeted for conversion to Scientology. In a church policy letter in 1973, L. Ron Hubbard wrote, \"The purpose of [the] Celebrity Centre is, to forward the expansion and popularization of Scientology through the arts.\"\n\nScientology operates eight churches that are designated \"Celebrity Centres\", designed to minister to celebrity Scientologists. The largest of these is in Hollywood, California, called \"Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International\". The Celebrity Centre International was the first one that was opened in 1969 and its opening is celebrated the first week of August each year in an evening gala.\n\nFormer silent-screen star Gloria Swanson and actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta have spoken publicly about their commitment to Scientology, as has actress and musician Juliette Lewis.\n\nSeveral Scientology organizations promote the use of Scientology technology as a means to solve social problems. Scientology began to focus on these issues in the early 1970s, led by Hubbard. The church developed outreach programs to fight drug addiction, illiteracy, learning disabilities and criminal behavior. These have been presented to schools, businesses and communities as secular techniques based on Hubbard's writings. The Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE) acts as an umbrella organization for these efforts. Notable examples include:\n\n\nThe Church of Scientology began its \"Volunteer Ministers\" program as a way to participate in community outreach projects. Volunteer Ministers sometimes travel to the scenes of major disasters in order to provide assistance with relief efforts. According to critics, these relief efforts consist of passing out copies of a pamphlet authored by Hubbard entitled \"The Way to Happiness\", and engaging in a method said to calm panicked or injured individuals known in Scientology as a \"touch assist.\" Accounts of the Volunteer Ministers' effectiveness have been mixed, and touch assists are not supported by scientific evidence.\n\nOther Scientology-related organizations include:\n\nThe Church of Scientology is one of the most controversial religious organizations. A first point of controversy was its challenge of the psychotherapeutic establishment. Another was a 1991 Time magazine article that attacked the church, who responded with a major lawsuit that was rejected by the court as baseless early in 1992. And a third is its religious status in the United States, formalized when the IRS granted the organization tax-exempt status in 1993.\n\nIt has been in conflict with the governments and police forces of many countries (including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France and Germany). It has been one of the most litigious religious movements in history, filing countless lawsuits against governments, organizations and individuals.\n\nReports and allegations have been made, by journalists, courts, and governmental bodies of several countries, that the Church of Scientology is an unscrupulous commercial enterprise that harasses its critics and brutally exploits its members. A considerable amount of investigation has been aimed at the church, by groups ranging from the media to governmental agencies.\n\nThe controversies involving the church and its critics, some of them ongoing, include:\n\nScientology social programs such as drug and criminal rehabilitation have likewise drawn both support and criticism.\n\nStephen A. Kent, a professor of sociology, has said that \"Scientologists see themselves as possessors of doctrines and skills that can save the world, if not the galaxy.\" As stated in Scientology doctrine: \"The whole agonized future of this planet, every man, woman and child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology.\" Kent has described Scientology's ethics system as \"a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefited [the Church of Scientology] ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people's interests in things other than Scientology.\"\n\nMany former members have come forward to speak out about the Church and the negative effects its teachings have had on them, including celebrities such as Leah Remini. Remini spoke about her split from the Church, saying that she still has friends within the organization who she is no longer able to speak to.\n\nMuch of the controversy surrounding Scientology stems from the criminal convictions of core members of the Scientology organization.\n\nIn 1978, a number of Scientologists, including L. Ron Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard (who was second in command in the organization at the time), were convicted of perpetrating what was at the time the largest incident of domestic espionage in the history of the United States, called \"Operation Snow White\". This involved infiltrating, wiretapping, and stealing documents from the offices of Federal attorneys and the Internal Revenue Service. L. Ron Hubbard was convicted \"in absentia\" by French authorities of engaging in fraud and sentenced to four years in prison. The head of the French Church of Scientology was convicted at the same trial and given a suspended one-year prison sentence.\n\nAn FBI raid on the Church's headquarters revealed documentation that detailed Scientology's criminal actions against various critics of the organization. In \"Operation Freakout\", agents of the church attempted to destroy Paulette Cooper, author of \"The Scandal of Scientology\", an early book that had been critical of the movement. Among these documents was a plan to frame Gabe Cazares, the mayor of Clearwater, Florida, with a staged hit-and-run accident.\n\nIn 1988, Scientology president Heber Jentzsch and ten other members of the organization were arrested in Spain on various charges including illicit association, coercion, fraud, and labor law violations.\n\nIn October 2009, the Church of Scientology was found guilty of organized fraud in France. The sentence was confirmed by appeal court in February 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Belgian prosecutors indicted Scientology as a criminal organization engaged in fraud\nand extortion. On March 2016, the Church of Scientology was acquitted of all charges, and demands to close its Belgian branch and European headquarters were dismissed.\n\nScientology has historically engaged in hostile action toward its critics; executives within the organization have proclaimed that Scientology is \"not a turn-the-other-cheek religion\". Journalists, politicians, former Scientologists and various anti-cult groups have made accusations of wrongdoing against Scientology since the 1960s, and Scientology has targeted these critics – almost without exception – for retaliation, in the form of lawsuits and public counter-accusations of personal wrongdoing. Many of Scientology's critics have also reported they were subject to threats and harassment in their private lives.\n\nAccording to a 1990 \"Los Angeles Times\" article, Scientology had largely switched from using church members to using private investigators, including former and current Los Angeles police officers, as this gives the church a layer of protection in case investigators use tactics embarrassing to the church. In one case, the church described their tactics as \"LAPD sanctioned,\" which was energetically disputed by Police Chief Daryl Gates. The officer involved in this particular case of surveillance and harassment was suspended for six months.\n\nJournalist John Sweeney reported that \"While making our BBC Panorama film \"Scientology and Me\" I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a 'bigot' by star Scientologists, brain-washed—that is how it felt to me—in a mock up of a Nazi-style torture chamber and chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers\".\n\nDuring the auditing process, the auditor collects and records personal information from the client.\n\nWhile the Church of Scientology claims to protect the confidentiality of auditing records, the Church has a history of attacking and psychologically abusing former members using information culled from the records. For example, a December 16, 1969, a Guardian's Office order (G. O. 121669) by Mary Sue Hubbard explicitly authorized the use of auditing records for purposes of \"internal security.\" Former members report having participated in combing through information obtained in auditing sessions to see if it could be used for smear campaigns against critics.\n\nThe practice of shunning in Scientology is termed \"Disconnection\". Members can disconnect from any person they already know, including existing family members. Many examples of this policy's application have been established in court. Failure to disconnect from a Suppressive Person is itself labelled a Suppressive act.\n\nThe Sea Org originally operated on vessels at sea where it was understood that it was not permitted to raise children on board the ships. Pregnant women in the Sea Org have reported been pressured to undergo abortions. Sea Org members were reportedly shown secret writings by L. Ron Hubbard to convince them that having an abortion was not against Scientology practices.\n\nIn 2003, \"The Times of India\" reported that \"Forced abortions, beatings, starvation are considered tools of discipline in this church.\"\n\nA former high-ranking source reports that \"some 1,500 abortions\" have been \"carried out by women in the Sea Organization since the implementation of a rule in the late '80s that members could not remain in the organization if they decided to have children.\" The source noted that \"And if members who have been in the Sea Organization for, say, 10 years do decide to have kids, they are dismissed with no more than $1,000\" as a severance package.\n\nMany former members have claimed they were pressured to undergo abortion.\n\nLongtime member Astra Woodcraft reportedly \"left Scientology for good when the church tried to pressure her to have an abortion\". Former Sea Org member Karen Pressley recounted that she was often asked by fellow Scientologists for loans so that they could get an abortion and remain in the Sea Org. Scientology employee Claire Headley has claimed that she worked \"was forced to have (two) abortions to keep her job and was subjected to violations of personal rights and liberties for the purpose of obtaining forced labor.\" Laura Ann DeCrescenzo reported that while a minor, she was \"coerced to have an abortion\".\n\nIn March 2009, Maureen Bolstad reported that women who worked at Scientology's headquarters were forced to have abortions, or faced being declared a \"Suppressive Person\" by the organization's management. In March 2010, former Scientologist Janette Lang stated that at age 20 she became pregnant by her boyfriend while in the organization, and her boyfriend's Scientology supervisors \"coerced them into terminating the pregnancy\". \"We fought for a week, I was devastated, I felt abused, I was lost and eventually I gave in. It was my baby, my body and my choice, and all of that was taken away from me by Scientology,\" said Lang.\n\nAustralian Senator Nick Xenophon gave a speech to the Australian Parliament in November 2009, about statements he had received from former Scientologists. He said that he had been told members of the organization had coerced pregnant female employees to have abortions. \"I am deeply concerned about this organisation and the devastating impact it can have on its followers,\" said Senator Xenophon, and he requested that the Australian Senate begin an investigation into Scientology. According to the letters presented by Senator Xenophon, the organization was involved in \"ordering\" its members to have abortions. Former Scientologist Aaron Saxton sent a letter to Senator Xenophon stating he had participated in coercing pregnant women within the organization to have abortions. \"Aaron says women who fell pregnant were taken to offices and bullied to have an abortion. If they refused, they faced demotion and hard labour. Aaron says one staff member used a coat hanger and self-aborted her child for fear of punishment,\" said Senator Xenophon. Carmel Underwood, another former Scientologist, said she had been put under \"extreme pressure\" to have an abortion, and that she was placed into a \"disappearing programme\", after refusing. Underwood was the executive director of Scientology's branch in Sydney, Australia.\n\nScientology spokesman Tommy Davis dismissed such claims as \"utterly meritless\". Mike Ferriss, the head of Scientology in New Zealand, told media that \"There are no forced abortions in Scientology\". Scientology spokesperson Virginia Stewart likewise rejected the claims and asserted \"The Church of Scientology considers the family unit and children to be of the utmost importance and does not condone nor force anyone to undertake any medical procedure whatsoever.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Miscavige's organization took action against increased criticism of Scientology on the Internet and online distribution of Scientology-related documents.\n\nStarting in 1991, Scientology filed fifty lawsuits against Scientology-critic Cult Awareness Network (CAN). Many of the suits were dismissed, but one resulted in $2 million in losses, bankrupting the network. At bankruptcy, CAN's name and logo were obtained by a Scientologist. A New Cult Awareness Network was set up with Scientology backing, which operates as an information and networking center for non-traditional religions, referring callers to academics and other experts.\n\nIn a 1993 U.S. lawsuit brought by the Church of Scientology against Steven Fishman, a former member of the Church, Fishman made a court declaration which included several dozen pages of formerly secret esoterica detailing aspects of Scientologist cosmogony. As a result of the litigation, this material, normally strictly safeguarded and used only in Scientology's more advanced \"OT levels\", found its way onto the Internet. This resulted in a battle between the Church of Scientology and its online critics over the right to disclose this material, or safeguard its confidentiality. The Church of Scientology was forced to issue a press release acknowledging the existence of this cosmogony, rather than allow its critics \"to distort and misuse this information for their own purposes.\" Even so, the material, notably the story of Xenu, has since been widely disseminated and used to caricature Scientology, despite the Church's vigorous program of copyright litigation.\n\nIn January 1995, church lawyer Helena Kobrin attempted to shut down the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology by sending a control message instructing Usenet servers to delete the group. In practice, this rmgroup message had little effect, since most Usenet servers are configured to disregard such messages when sent to groups that receive substantial traffic, and newgroup messages were quickly issued to recreate the group on those servers that did not do so. However, the issuance of the message led to a great deal of public criticism by free-speech advocates. Among the criticisms raised, one suggestion is that Scientology's true motive is to suppress the free speech of its critics.\nThe Church also began filing lawsuits against those who posted copyrighted texts on the newsgroup and the World Wide Web, and lobbied for tighter restrictions on copyrights in general. The Church supported the controversial Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act as well as the even more controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Some of the DMCA's provisions (notably the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act) were heavily influenced by Church litigation against US Internet service providers over copyrighted Scientology materials that had been posted or uploaded through their servers.\n\nBeginning in the middle of 1996 and ensuing for several years, the newsgroup was attacked by anonymous parties using a tactic dubbed \"sporgery\" by some, in the form of hundreds of thousands of forged spam messages posted on the group. Some investigators said that some spam had been traced to church members. Former Scientologist Tory Christman later asserted that the Office of Special Affairs had undertaken a concerted effort to destroy alt.religion.scientology through these means; the effort failed.\n\nOn January 14, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Tom Cruise was leaked to the Internet and uploaded to YouTube.\nThe Church of Scientology issued a copyright violation claim against YouTube requesting the removal of the video. Subsequently, the group Anonymous voiced its criticism of Scientology and began attacking the Church. Calling the action by the Church of Scientology a form of Internet censorship, participants of Anonymous coordinated Project Chanology, which consisted of a series of denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites, prank calls, and black faxes to Scientology centers. On January 21, 2008, Anonymous announced its intentions via a video posted to YouTube entitled \"Message to Scientology\", and a press release declaring a \"war\" against both the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center.\nIn the press release, the group stated that the attacks against the Church of Scientology would continue in order to protect the freedom of speech, and end what they saw as the financial exploitation of church members.\n\nOn January 28, 2008, an Anonymous video appeared on YouTube calling for protests outside Church of Scientology centers on February 10, 2008. According to a letter Anonymous e-mailed to the press, about 7,000 people protested in more than 90 cities worldwide. Many protesters wore masks based on the character V from \"V for Vendetta\" (who was influenced by Guy Fawkes) or otherwise disguised their identities, in part to protect themselves from reprisals from the Church of Scientology.\nMany further protests have followed since then in cities around the world.\n\nThe Arbitration Committee of the Wikipedia internet encyclopedia decided in May 2009 to restrict access to its site from Church of Scientology IP addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by Scientologists. A \"host of anti-Scientologist editors\" were topic-banned as well. The committee concluded that both sides had \"gamed policy\" and resorted to \"battlefield tactics\", with articles on living persons being the \"worst casualties\".\n\nThe legal status of Scientology or Scientology-related organizations differs between jurisdictions. Scientology was legally recognized as a tax-exempt religion in South Africa, Australia, Sweden, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain. Scientology was granted tax-exempt status in the United States in 1993. The organization is considered a cult in Chile and an \"anticonstitutional sect\" in Germany, and is considered a cult (French \"secte\") by some French public authorities.\n\nThe church argues that Scientology is a genuine religious movement that has been misrepresented, maligned, and persecuted. The Church of Scientology has pursued an extensive public relations campaign for the recognition of Scientology as a tax-exempt religion in the various countries in which it exists.\n\nScientology has often encountered opposition due to its strong-arm tactics directed against critics and members wishing to leave the organization. A number of governments regard the Church as a religious organization entitled to tax-exempt status, while governments variously classify it as a business, cult, pseudoreligion, or criminal organization.\n\nIn 1957, the Church of Scientology of California was granted tax-exempt status by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and so, for a time, were other local churches. In 1958 however, the IRS started a review of the appropriateness of this status. In 1959, Hubbard moved to England, remaining there until the mid-1960s.\n\nIn the mid-sixties, the Church of Scientology was banned in several Australian states, starting with Victoria in 1965. The ban was based on the Anderson Report, which found that the auditing process involved \"command\" hypnosis, in which the hypnotist assumes \"positive authoritative control\" over the patient. On this point the report stated, It is the firm conclusion of this Board that most scientology and dianetic techniques are those of authoritative hypnosis and as such are dangerous ... the scientific evidence which the Board heard from several expert witnesses of the highest repute ... leads to the inescapable conclusion that it is only in name that there is any difference between authoritative hypnosis and most of the techniques of scientology. Many scientology techniques are in fact hypnotic techniques, and Hubbard has not changed their nature by changing their names. The Australian Church was forced to operate under the name of the \"Church of the New Faith\" as a result, the name and practice of Scientology having become illegal in the relevant states. Several years of court proceedings aimed at overturning the ban followed. In 1973, state laws banning Scientology were overturned in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. In 1983 the High Court of Australia ruled in a unanimous decision that the Church of Scientology was \"undoubtedly a religion and deserving of tax exemption.\".\n\nIn 1967, the IRS removed Scientology's tax-exempt status, asserting that its activities were commercial and operated for the benefit of Hubbard, rather than for charitable or religious purposes. The decision resulted in a process of litigation that was settled in the Church's favor a quarter of a century later, the longest case of litigation in IRS history.\n\nScientology is officially recognized as a religion in the United States. Recognition came in 1993, when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stated that \"[Scientology is] operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes.\" Scientology was again recognized as a religion by the U.S. courts when the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in \"Headley v. Church of Scientology International\" in 2012.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" noted in this connection that the Church of Scientology had funded a campaign which included a whistle-blower organization to publicly attack the IRS, as well as hiring of private investigators to look into the private lives of IRS officials. In 1991, Miscavige, the highest-ranking Scientology leader, arranged a meeting with Fred T. Goldberg Jr., the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service at the time. The meeting was an \"opportunity for the church to offer to end its long dispute with the agency, including the dozens of suits brought against the IRS.\" The committee met several times with the Scientology legal team and \"was persuaded that those involved in the Snow White crimes had been purged, that church money was devoted to tax-exempt purposes and that, with Mr. Hubbard's death, no one was getting rich from Scientology.\" In August 1993, a settlement was reached; the church would receive its tax-exempt status and end its legal actions against the IRS and its personnel. The church was required only to resubmit new applications for exemption to the IRS Exempt Organizations (EO) division, which was told \"not to consider any substantive matters\" because those issues had been resolved by the committee. The secret agreement was announced on October 13, 1993, with the IRS refusing to disclose any of the terms or the reasoning behind the decision. Both the IRS and Scientology rejected any allegations that foul play or undue pressure had been used on IRS officials, insisting that the decision had been based on the merits of the case. IRS officials \"insisted that Scientology's tactics had not affected the decision\" and that \"ultimately the decision was made on a legal basis\". Miscavige claims that the IRS's examination of Scientology was the most exhaustive review of any non-profit organization in history.\n\nElsewhere, Scientology is recognized as a religion in Australia, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden, Croatia, Hungary and Kyrgyzstan. In New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department classified the Church of Scientology as a charitable organization and stated that its income would be tax exempt. It has gained judicial recognition in Italy, and Scientology officials have won the right to perform marriages in South Africa.\n\nScientology is not recognized as a religion in Canada. In the UK, the Charity Commission for England and Wales ruled in 1999 that Scientology was not a religion and refused to register the Church as a charity, although a year later, it was recognized as a not-for-profit body in a separate proceeding by the UK Revenue and Customs and exempted from UK value added tax. In December 2013, the United Kingdom's highest court officially recognized Scientology as a religion. The ruling ended a five-year legal battle by Scientologist Louisa Hodkin, who sought the legal right to marry at the Church of Scientology chapel in central London. The opinion by five supreme court justices redefined religion in law, rendering the 1970 definition \"out of date\" in restricting religious worship to \"reverence or veneration of God or of a Supreme Being.\"\n\nScientology has been accused of being \"a business, often given to criminal acts, and sometimes masquerading as a religion.\"\n\nIn conjunction with the Church of Scientology's request to be officially recognized as a religion in Germany, around 1996 the German state Baden-Württemberg conducted a thorough investigation of the group's activities within Germany. The results of this investigation indicated that at the time of publication, Scientology's main sources of revenue (\"Haupteinnahmequellen der SO\") were from course offerings and sales of their various publications. Course offerings ranged from (German Marks) DM 182.50 to about DM 30,000the equivalent today of approximately $119 to $19,560 USD. Revenue from monthly, bi-monthly, and other membership offerings could not be estimated in the report, but was nevertheless placed in the millions. Defending its practices against accusations of profiteering, the Church has countered critics by drawing analogies to other religious groups who have established practices such as tithing, or require members to make donations for specific religious services.\n\nSince 1997 Germany has considered Scientology to be in conflict with the principles of the nation's constitution. It is seen as an anticonstitutional sect and a new version of political extremism and because there is \"evidence for intentions against the free democratic basic order\" it is observed by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the \"International Herald Tribune\", drew parallels between the \"organized oppression\" of Scientologists in Germany and the treatment of Jews in 1930s' Nazi Germany. The letter was signed by Dustin Hoffman, Goldie Hawn and a number of other Hollywood celebrities and executives. Commenting on the matter, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State said that Scientologists were discriminated against in Germany, but condemned the comparisons to the Nazis' treatment of Jews as extremely inappropriate, as did a United Nations Special Rapporteur. Based on the IRS exemptions, the U.S. State Department formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists and began to note Scientologists' complaints of harassment in its annual human rights reports, as well as the annual International Religious Freedom Reports it has released from 1999 onwards. Germany will continue to monitor Scientology's activities in the country, despite continued objection from Scientology which cites such monitoring as abuse of freedom of religion.\n\nFrance and Belgium have not recognized Scientology as a religion, and Stephen A. Kent, writing in 2001, noted that recognition had not been obtained in Ireland, Luxembourg, Israel or Mexico either. The Belgian State Prosecution Service has recommended that various individuals and organizations associated with Scientology should be prosecuted. An administrative court has yet to decide if charges will be pressed.\n\nIn Greece, Scientology is not recognized as a religion by the Greek government, and multiple applications for religious status have been denied, notably in 2000 and 2003.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Scientology was granted tax exempt status in October 2013. The status was revoked in October 2015. The court ruled that because auditing fees and course costs were more expensive than most commercial education institutions, Scientology appeared to be aimed at making a profit.\n\nScientology maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, icons, and names. It claims copyright and trademark over its \"Scientology cross\", and its lawyers have threatened lawsuits against individuals and organizations who have published the image in books and on Web sites. Because of this, it is very difficult for individual groups to attempt to publicly practice Scientology on their own, independent of the official Church of Scientology. Scientology has filed suit against a number of individuals who have attempted to set up their own auditing practices, using copyright and trademark law to shut these groups down.\n\nThe Church of Scientology and its many related organizations have amassed considerable real estate holdings worldwide, likely in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Scientology encourages existing members to \"sell\" Scientology to others by paying a commission to those who recruit new members. Scientology franchises, or missions, must pay the Church of Scientology roughly 10% of their gross income. On that basis, it is likened to a pyramid selling scheme. While introductory courses do not cost much, courses at the higher levels may cost several thousand dollars each. As a rule, the great majority of members proceeds up the bridge in a steady rate commensurate with their income. Most recently the Italian Supreme Court agreed with the American IRS that the church's financial system is analogous to the practices of other groups and not out of line with its religious purposes.\n\nIn November 2009, Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used a speech in Federal Parliament to allege that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organization. Based on letters from former followers of the religion, he said that there were \"allegations of forced imprisonment, coerced abortions, and embezzlement of church funds, of physical violence and intimidation, blackmail and the widespread and deliberate abuse of information obtained by the organization\".\n\nDescribing the available scholarship on Scientology, David G. Bromley and Douglas E. Cowan stated in 2006 that \"most scholars have concluded that Scientology falls within the category of religion for the purposes of academic study, and a number have defended the Church in judicial and political proceedings on this basis.\" Hugh B. Urban writes that \"Scientology's efforts to get itself defined as a religion make it an ideal case study for thinking about how we understand and define religion.\" Toward the second decade of the 2000s, a new interest for Scientology emerged among scholars, bringing the subject from obscurity.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopedia of Religious Controversies in the United States\", \"even as Scientology raises questions about how and who gets to define religion, most scholars recognize it as a religion, one that emerges from and builds on American individualism and the spiritual marketplace that dominated 1950s America.\" David G. Bromley comments that Scientology \"could gain strength by adding to the new perspective on existence, the hope and human meaning that only a transcendent creed can give.\"\n\nBromley and Cowan noted in 2008 that Scientology's attempts \"to gain favor with new religion scholars\" had often been problematic. According to Religious Studies professor Mary Farrell Benarowski, Scientology describes itself as drawing on science, religion, psychology and philosophy but \"had been claimed by none of them and repudiated, for the most part, by all.\"\n\nRegis Dericquesbourg writes about the efficacy of Scientology in imparting knowledge: \"Scientology indeed not only brings knowledge, it also brings personal introspection through auditing, and transmission in upper levels is not merely reading texts: what is transmitted is experienced through a solo or duo auditing experience.\" He compared it to psychoanalysis.\n\nFrank K. Flinn, adjunct professor of religious studies at Washington University in St. Louis wrote, \"it is abundantly clear that Scientology has both the typical forms of ceremonial and celebratory worship and its own unique form of spiritual life.\" Flinn further states that religion requires \"beliefs in something transcendental or ultimate, practices (rites and codes of behavior) that re-inforce those beliefs and, a community that is sustained by both the beliefs and practices\", all of which are present within Scientology. Similarly, \"World Religions in America\" states that \"Scientology contains the same elements of most other religions, including myths, scriptures, doctrines, worship, sacred practices and rituals, moral and ethical expectations, a community of believers, clergy, and ecclesiastic organizations.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging that a number of his colleagues accept Scientology as a religion, sociologist Stephen A. Kent writes: \"Rather than struggling over whether or not to label Scientology as a religion, I find it far more helpful to view it as a multifaceted transnational corporation, only \"one\" element of which is religious\" [emphasis in the original].\n\nDonna Batten in the \"Gale Encyclopedia of American Law\" writes, \"A belief does not need to be stated in traditional terms to fall within First Amendment protection. For example, Scientology—a system of beliefs that a human being is essentially a free and immortal spirit who merely inhabits a body—does not propound the existence of a supreme being, but it qualifies as a religion under the broad definition propounded by the Supreme Court.\"\n\nJ. Gordon Melton asserts that while the debate over definitions of religion will continue, \"scholars will probably continue in the future to adopt a broad definition, thus including Scientology in a wider religious field.\"\n\nThe material contained in the OT levels has been characterized as bad science fiction by critics, while others claim it bears structural similarities to gnostic thought and ancient Hindu beliefs of creation and cosmic struggle. Melton suggests that these elements of the OT levels may never have been intended as descriptions of historical events and that, like other religious mythology, they may have their truth in the realities of the body and mind which they symbolize. He adds that on whatever level Scientologists might have received this mythology, they seem to have found it useful in their spiritual quest.\n\nScholar Luigi Berzano of the University of Turin listed five religious characteristics of Scientology: a set of doctrines leading to a spiritual goal, a community of believers, an authority figure (Hubbard), ritual practices, and \"an ethical-moral view of life.\"\n\nDuring his lifetime, Hubbard was accused of using religion as a façade for Scientology to maintain tax-exempt status and avoid prosecution for false medical claims. The IRS cited a statement frequently attributed to Hubbard that the way to get rich was to found a religion. Though some claim the statement is unsubstantiated, many of Hubbard's science fiction colleagues, including Sam Merwin, Lloyd Arthur Eshbach and Sam Moscowitz, recall Hubbard raising the topic in conversation.\n\nHubbard grew up in a climate that was very critical of organized religion, and frequently quoted anti-religious sentiments in his early lectures. The scholar Marco Frenschkowski (University of Mainz) has stated that it was not easy for Hubbard \"to come to terms with the spiritual side of his own movement. Hubbard did not want to found a religion: he discovered that what he was talking about in fact was religion. This mainly happened when he had to deal with apparent memories from former lives. He had to defend himself about this to his friends.\" Frenschkowski allows that there were practical concerns in the question of \"how to present Scientology to the outside world\", but dismisses the notion that the religious format was just an expedient pretense; Frenschkowski points to many passages in Hubbard's works that document his struggle with this question. Frenschkowski suggests that it was a biographical mistake to suggest that Hubbard only became interested in Scientology as a religion in 1954. He notes that Hubbard discussed religion and the concept of God even in the years leading up to the emergence of Scientology, and that he did not \"rush into religion\" but rather, \"discovered it through the development of his work with pre-clears.\"\n\nDrawing parallels to similar struggles for identity in other religious movements such as Theosophy and Transcendental Meditation, Frenschkowski sees in Hubbard's lectures \"the case of a man whose background was non-religious and who nevertheless discovers that his ideas somehow oscillate between 'science' (in a very popular sense), 'religion' and 'philosophy', and that these ideas somehow fascinate so many people that they start to form a separate movement.\" Hubbard experiments with traditional religious language in a short piece written in 1953 called \"The Factors\", \"a basic expression of Scientologist cosmology and metaphysics\", reprinted in current Scientology literature. Frenschkowski observes that the text is partly biblical in structure and that this development is a component of Scientology's metamorphosis into a religion, written at a point when the nature of the new movement was unclear.\n\nThe Church of Scientology denounces the idea of Hubbard starting a religion for personal gain as an unfounded rumor. The Church also suggests that the origin of the rumor was a remark by George Orwell which had been misattributed to Hubbard. Robert Vaughn Young, who left the Church in 1989 after being its spokesman for twenty years, suggested that reports of Hubbard making such a statement could be explained as a misattribution, despite having encountered three of Hubbard's associates from his science fiction days who remembered Hubbard making statements of that sort in person. It was Young who by a stroke of luck came up with the \"Orwell quote\": \"but I have always thought there might be a lot of cash in starting a new religion, and we'll talk it over some time\". It appears in a letter by Eric Blair (known the world as George Orwell) to his friend, Jack Common, dated 16-February-38 (February 16, 1938), and was published in \"Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell\", vol. 1. In 2006, \"Rolling Stone\"'s Janet Reitman also attributed the statement to Hubbard, as a remark to science fiction writer Lloyd Eshbach and recorded in Eshbach's autobiography.\n\nScientology can be seen as a UFO religion in which the existence of extraterrestrial entities operating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) are an element of belief. In this context, it is discussed in \"UFO Religions\" by Christopher Partridge, and \"The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions\" by James R. Lewis, while Susan Palmer draws several parallels with Raelianism. Gregory Reece, in his book \"UFO Religion: Inside flying saucer cults and culture\", writes: Scientology is unique within the UFO culture because of this secretiveness, as well as because of the capitalist format under which they operate. Scientology is also difficult to categorize. While it bears strong similarities to the Ashtar Command or the Aetherius Society, its emphasis upon the Xenu event as the central message of the group seems to place them within the ancient astronaut tradition. Either way, Scientology is perhaps most different from other UFO groups in their attempt to keep all of the space opera stuff under wraps. They really would have preferred the rest of us not to know about Xenu and the galactic federation. Alas, such secrets are hard to keep\n\nRegardless of such statements by critics, Hubbard wrote and lectured openly about the material he himself called \"space opera.\" In 1952, Hubbard published a book (\"\") on space opera and other material that may be encountered when auditing preclears.\n\nAccording to David G. Bromley, Scientology is \"part therapy, part religion, part UFO group. It's a mix of things unlike any other religious group out there.\" Scholar Andreas Grunschlo writes that as a ufogical religion, Scientology \"conceives of earthly human beings primarily as extraterrestrial spirits ('Thetans') which have now to put on their 'bridge to freedom' again —a soul conception which is paralleled by the typical ufogical 'star seeds' or 'walk-ins' planted on this earthly 'garden' for spiritual growth.\"\n\nThe general orientation of Hubbard's philosophy owes much to Will Durant, author of the popular 1926 classic \"The Story of Philosophy\"; \"Dianetics\" is dedicated to Durant. Hubbard's view of a mechanically functioning mind in particular finds close parallels in Durant's work on Spinoza. According to Hubbard himself, Scientology is \"the Western anglicized continuance of many early forms of wisdom.\" Ankerberg and Weldon mention the sources of Scientology to include \"the Vedas, Buddhism, Judaism, Gnosticism, Taoism, early Greek civilization and the teachings of Jesus, Nietzsche and Freud.\" Hubbard asserted that Freudian thought was a \"major precursor\" to Scientology. W. Vaughn Mccall, Professor and Chairman of the Georgia Regents University writes, \"Both Freudian theory and Hubbard assume that there are unconscious mental processes that may be shaped by early life experiences, and that these influence later behavior and thought.\" Both schools of thought propose a \"tripartite structure of the mind.\" Sigmund Freud's psychology, popularized in the 1930s and 1940s, was a key contributor to the Dianetics therapy model, and was acknowledged unreservedly as such by Hubbard in his early works. Hubbard never forgot, when he was 12 years old, meeting Cmdr. Joseph Cheesman Thompson, a U.S. Navy officer who had studied with Freud and when writing to the American Psychological Association in 1949, he stated that he was conducting research based on the \"early work of Freud\".\n\nIn \"Dianetics\", Hubbard cites Hegel as a negative influence — an object lesson in \"confusing\" writing. According to Mary A. Mann, Scientology is considered nondenominational, accepting all people regardless of their religions background, ethnicity, or educational attainment. Another major influence was Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics. Hubbard was friends with fellow science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt, who explored the implications of Korzybski's non-Aristotelian logic in works such as \"The World of Null-A\", and Hubbard's view of the \"reactive mind\" has clear and acknowledged parallels with Korzybski's thought; in fact, Korzybski's \"anthropometer\" may have been what inspired Hubbard's invention of the E-meter.\n\nBeyond that, Hubbard himself named a great many other influences in his own writing – in \"Scientology 8-8008\", for example, these include philosophers from Anaxagoras and Aristotle to Herbert Spencer and Voltaire, physicists and mathematicians like Euclid and Isaac Newton, as well as founders of religions such as Buddha, Confucius, Jesus and Mohammed – but there is little evidence in Hubbard's writings that he studied these figures to any great depth.\n\nAs noted, elements of the Eastern religions are evident in Scientology, in particular the concept of karma found in Hinduism and Jainism. In addition to the links to Hindu texts, Scientology draws from Taoism and Buddhism. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Community\", Scientology \"shows affinities with Buddhism and a remarkable similarity to first-century Gnosticism.\"\n\nIn the 1940s, Hubbard was in contact with Jack Parsons, a rocket scientist and member of the Ordo Templi Orientis then led by Aleister Crowley, and there have been suggestions that this connection influenced some of the ideas and symbols of Scientology. Religious scholars Gerald Willms and J. Gordon Melton have stated that Crowley's teachings bear little if any resemblance to Scientology doctrine.\n\nJ. Gordon Melton writes that Scientology has its roots in Esoteric thought. He cited the significance of understanding Scientology's appeal as aligned with Esoteric tradition. The Church is a \"significant revision\" and \"meaningful revitalization\" within the esoteric tradition. Melton states that Scientology can also be traced back to Gnosticism, Manicheanism, Freemasonry and Theosophy.\n\nAccording to James R. Lewis, Scientology is in the same lineage of supernatural religious movements such as New Thought. Scientology goes beyond this and refers to their religio-therapeutic practices as religious technology. Lewis wrote, \"Scientology sees their psycho-spiritual technology as supplying the missing ingredient in existing technologies—namely, the therapeutic engineering of the human psyche.\"\n\nHubbard was said to be an accomplished hypnotist, and close acquaintances such as Forrest Ackerman (Hubbard's literary agent) and A. E. van Vogt (an early supporter of Dianetics) witnessed repeated demonstrations of his hypnotic skills. Scientology literature states that L. Ron Hubbard expertise in hypnosis led to the discovery of the Dianetic engram. However, Hubbard wrote that hypnosis is a \"wild variable\", and compared parlor hypnosis to an atom bomb. He also wrote:\n\nThe word \"Scientology\" is a pairing of the Latin word \"scientia\" (\"knowledge\", \"skill\"), which comes from the verb \"scīre\" (\"to know\"), and the Greek λόγος \"lógos\" (\"word\" or \"account [of]\"). \"Scientology\", as coined by L. Ron Hubbard, comes from the Latin \"scio\", which means \"knowing, in the fullest meaning of the word\" and the Greek word logos, which means \"study of\". Scientology is further defined as \"the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, universes, and other life.\"\n\nThe term scientology had been used in published works at least twice before Hubbard. In \"The New Word\" (1901) poet and lawyer Allen Upward first used scientology to mean blind, unthinking acceptance of scientific doctrine. In 1934, philosopher Anastasius Nordenholz published \"Scientology: Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge\", which used the term to mean the science of science. It is unknown whether Hubbard was aware of either prior usage of the word.\n\nThe ARC and KRC triangles are concept maps which show a relationship between three concepts to form another concept. These two triangles are present in the Scientology symbol. The lower triangle, the ARC triangle, is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for. It encompasses Affinity\" (affection, love or liking), Reality\" (consensual reality) and Communication\" (the exchange of ideas). Scientology teaches that improving one of the three aspects of the triangle \"increases the level\" of the other two, but Communication is held to be the most important. The upper triangle is the KRC triangle, the letters KRC positing a similar relationship between Knowledge\", Responsibility\" and Control\".\n\nAmong Scientologists, the letters ARC are used as an affectionate greeting in personal communication, for example at the end of a letter. Social problems are ascribed to breakdowns in ARC – in other words, a lack of agreement on reality, a failure to communicate effectively, or a failure to develop affinity. These can take the form of \"overts\" – harmful acts against another, either intentionally or by omission – which are usually followed by \"withholds\" – efforts to conceal the wrongdoing, which further increase the level of tension in the relationship.\n\nScientologists seek to attain spiritual development through study of Scientology materials and auditing. The subject (called \"Technology\" or \"Tech\" in Scientology jargon) is structured in a series of levels (or \"gradients\") of gradually increasing complexity. The sequence of study (\"training\") and auditing (\"processing\") levels is termed the \"Bridge to Total Freedom\", or simply \"the Bridge\". Training concerns primarily the principles and techniques of auditing. Processing is personal development through participation in auditing sessions.\n\nThe Church of Scientology teaches the principle of reciprocity, involving give-and-take in every human transaction. Accordingly, members are required to make donations for study courses and auditing as they move up the Bridge, the amounts increasing as higher levels are reached. Participation in higher-level courses on the Bridge may cost several thousand dollars, and Scientologists usually move up the Bridge at a rate governed by their income.\n\nAccording to David G. Bromley, religious studies professor, working toward being an \"Operating Thetan\" means moving up the Bridge to Total Freedom, \"which at the highest level transcends material law.\" He further emphasizes this belief of Scientologists: \"You occasionally come across people in Scientology who say they can change the material world with their mind.\"\n\nThe 2005 \"South Park\" episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" publicized the story of Xenu, based directly on the actual Scientology Operating Thetan III document, and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading \"This is what Scientologists actually believe\". After explaining these beliefs, the character representing the church's president ultimately reveals to Stan that the church is in reality a money-making scam.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson's 2012 film \"The Master\" features a religious organization called \"The Cause\" that has many similarities to Scientology. Also, the character of Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman shares a physical resemblance to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nIn April 2015, following the recent release of \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\", \"Saturday Night Live\" aired a music video featuring the \"Church of Neurotology\", a parody of Scientology's 1990 music video \"We Stand Tall\".\n\nIn November 2016, cable network A&E began airing \"\", a documentary series. Remini, a TV actress and star, was a member of the Church of Scientology for over 30 years and a public proponent of Scientology for years before a public falling out in 2013. She is an executive producer of the series. The series follows Remini as she explores the history and workings of the Church, discusses her experiences and interviews ex-members willing to speak out about alleged abuses of the Church. The initial episode drew 2.1 million viewers.\n\n\n\n"}

After graduating from a high school in Sendai, he obtained a job in a manufacturing company. He became intrigued by archaeology when he was a child, finding shards of Jōmon pottery in the backyard of his house.\n\nIn 1972 Fujimura began to study archaeology and to look for Paleolithic artifacts during his holidays. Within the few years to follow, he rose to fame among amateur and academic archaeologists in Sendai by which he was appointed the head of the NGO group, \"Sekki Bunka Kenkyukai\" in 1975. Fujimura discovered and excavated many Paleolithic stone artifacts in Miyagi prefecture, such as at \"Zazaragi site\" in 1981, \"Nakamine C site\" in 1983 and \"Babadan A site\" in 1984. From a cross-dating investigation of the stratum these stone tools were estimated to be about 50,000 years old.\n\nHe established his reputation as a leading amateur archaeologist because he found most of the artifacts on his own. He even became known as the archaeologist with the \"divine hands\".\n\nAfter this success, he participated in 180 archaeological digs in northern Japan and almost always found artifacts, their age becoming increasingly older. Based on his discoveries the history of the Japanese Paleolithic period was extended to about 300,000 years. Most of the archaeologists did not question Fujimura's work and this discovery was written in the history textbooks. Later he gained a position as a deputy director at the private NGO group \"Tohoku Paleolithic Institute\".\n\nDespite the acquiescence from the archeologists, some geologists and anthropologists claimed the discovery was dubious and lacked consistency with the geologic analysis of the sites.\n\nToshiki Takeoka at the Kyoritsu Joshi University published an article\n\nShizuo Oda and Charles T. Keally also mentioned some peculiarities in their article\n\nOn October 23, 2000, Fujimura and his team announced that they had another finding at the \"Kamitakamori site\" near Tsukidate town. The finds were estimated to be 570,000 years old.\n\nOn November 5, 2000, the newspaper \"Mainichi Shimbun\" published pictures of Fujimura digging holes and burying the artifacts his team later found. The pictures had been taken one day before the finding was announced. Fujimura admitted his forgery in an interview with the newspaper.\n\nFujimura confessed and apologized the same day in a press conference. He said that he had been \"possessed by an uncontrollable urge\". He had planted the artifacts from his own collection in strata that would have indicated earlier dates. In Kamitakamori he had planted 61 of 65 artifacts, and had earlier planted all of the stonework in the Soshin Fudozaka site in Hokkaidō. He claimed that these were the only times he had planted artifacts.\n\nThe Japanese Archaeological Association disaffiliated Fujimura from its members. A special investigation team of the Association revealed that almost all the artifacts which he had found were his fabrication.\n\nIn a series of articles in the Japanese magazine \"Shūkan Bunshun\" published on January 25, February 1 and March 15, 2001, the magazine alleged that the stone tools discovered at the Hijiridaki cave site (聖嶽洞窟遺跡) in Ōita Prefecture had also been forgeries, and indicated that Mitsuo Kagawa, a professor at Beppu University, had been involved in that hoax. Kagawa committed suicide and left a suicide note in which he pleaded his innocence.\n\nHis family filed a defamation suit against \"Shūkan Bunshun\" the same year. The Ōita district Court and the Fukuoka High Court decided to order the magazine to pay the damages and issue an apology to the family of Kagawa. The magazine appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan, although the appeal was rejected in September 2004. An apology statement was published in the September 2, 2004, issue.\n\n\n\n"}

Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, Ulster County, New York, but escaped with her infant daughter to freedom in 1826. After going to court to recover her son, in 1828 she became the first black woman to win such a case against a white man.\n\nShe gave herself the name Sojourner Truth in 1843 after she became convinced that God had called her to leave the city and go into the countryside \"testifying the hope that was in her\". Her best-known speech was delivered extemporaneously, in 1851, at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. The speech became widely known during the Civil War by the title \"Ain't I a Woman?,\" a variation of the original speech re-written by someone else using a stereotypical Southern dialect; whereas Sojourner Truth was from New York and grew up speaking Dutch as her first language. During the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army; after the war, she tried unsuccessfully to secure land grants from the federal government for former slaves.\n\nIn 2014, Truth was included in \"Smithsonian\" magazine's list of the \"100 Most Significant Americans of All Time\".\n\nTruth was one of the ten or twelve children born to James and Elizabeth Baumfree (or Bomefree). Colonel Hardenbergh bought James and Elizabeth Baumfree from slave traders and kept their family at his estate in a big hilly area called by the Dutch name Swartekill (just north of present-day Rifton), in the town of Esopus, New York, north of New York City. Charles Hardenbergh inherited his father's estate and continued to enslave people as a part of that estate's property.\n\nWhen Charles Hardenbergh died in 1806, nine-year-old Truth (known as Belle), was sold at an auction with a flock of sheep for $100 to John Neely, near Kingston, New York. Until that time, Truth spoke only Dutch. She later described Neely as cruel and harsh, relating how he beat her daily and once even with a bundle of rods. Neely sold her in 1808, for $105, to Martinus Schryver of Port Ewen, a tavern keeper, who owned her for eighteen months. Schryver sold her in 1810 to John Dumont of West Park, New York. Although this fourth owner was kindly disposed toward her, considerable tension existed between Truth and Dumont's second wife, Elizabeth Waring Dumont, who harassed her and made her life more difficult. (John Dumont's first wife, Sarah \"Sally\" Waring Dumont (Elizabeth's sister), died around 1805, five years before he bought Truth.)\n\nAround 1815, Truth met and fell in love with a slave named Robert from a neighboring farm. Robert's owner (Charles Catton, Jr., a landscape painter) forbade their relationship; he did not want the people he enslaved to have children with people he was not enslaving, because he would not own the children. One day Robert snuck over to see Truth. When Catton and his son found him, they savagely beat Robert until Dumont finally intervened, and Truth never saw Robert again. He died some years later, perhaps as a result of the injuries, and the experience haunted Truth throughout her life. Truth eventually married an older slave named Thomas. She bore five children: James, her firstborn, who died in childhood, Diana (1815), fathered by either Robert or John Dumont, and Peter (1821), Elizabeth (1825), and Sophia (ca. 1826), all born after she and Thomas united.\n\nThe state of New York began, in 1799, to legislate the abolition of slavery, although the process of emancipating those people enslaved in New York was not complete until July 4, 1827. Dumont had promised to grant Truth her freedom a year before the state emancipation, \"if she would do well and be faithful.\" However, he changed his mind, claiming a hand injury had made her less productive. She was infuriated but continued working, spinning 100 pounds of wool, to satisfy her sense of obligation to him.\n\nLate in 1826, Truth escaped to freedom with her infant daughter, Sophia. She had to leave her other children behind because they were not legally freed in the emancipation order until they had served as bound servants into their twenties. She later said \"I did not run off, for I thought that wicked, but I walked off, believing that to be all right.\"\n\nShe found her way to the home of Isaac and Maria Van Wagenen in New Paltz, who took her and her baby in. Isaac offered to buy her services for the remainder of the year (until the state's emancipation took effect), which Dumont accepted for $20. She lived there until the New York State Emancipation Act was approved a year later.\n\nTruth learned that her son Peter, then five years old, had been sold illegally by Dumont to an owner in Alabama. With the help of the Van Wagenens, she took the issue to court and in 1828, after months of legal proceedings, she got back her son, who had been abused by those who were enslaving him. Truth became one of the first black women to go to court against a white man and win the case.\n\nTruth had a life-changing religious experience during her stay with the Van Wagenens, and became a devout Christian. In 1829 she moved with her son Peter to New York City, where she worked as a housekeeper for Elijah Pierson, a Christian Evangelist. While in New York, she befriended Mary Simpson, a grocer on John Street who claimed she had once been enslaved by George Washington. They shared an interest in charity for the poor and became intimate friends. In 1832, she met Robert Matthews, also known as Prophet Matthias, and went to work for him as a housekeeper at the Matthias Kingdom communal colony. Elijah Pierson died, and Robert Matthews and Truth were accused of stealing from and poisoning him. Both were acquitted of the murder, though Matthews was convicted of lesser crimes, served time, and moved west.\n\nIn 1839, Truth's son Peter took a job on a whaling ship called the \"Zone of Nantucket\". From 1840 to 1841, she received three letters from him, though in his third letter he told her he had sent five. Peter said he also never received any of her letters. When the ship returned to port in 1842, Peter was not on board and Truth never heard from him again.\n\n1843 was a turning point for Truth. She became a Methodist, and on June 1, she changed her name to \"Sojourner Truth.\" She told friends: \"The Spirit calls me, and I must go\" and left to make her way traveling and preaching about the abolition of slavery. At that time, Truth began attending Millerite Adventist campmeetings. However, that did not last since Jesus failed to appear in 1843 and then again in 1844. Like many others disappointed, Truth distanced herself from her Millerite friends for a while.\n\nIn 1844, she joined the Northampton Association of Education and Industry in Northampton, Massachusetts. Founded by abolitionists, the organization supported women's rights and religious tolerance as well as pacifism. There were, in its four-and-a-half year history, a total of 240 members, though no more than 120 at any one time. They lived on , raising livestock, running a sawmill, a gristmill, and a silk factory. While there, Truth met William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and David Ruggles. In 1846, the group disbanded, unable to support itself. In 1845, she joined the household of George Benson, the brother-in-law of William Lloyd Garrison. In 1849, she visited John Dumont before he moved west.\n\nTruth started dictating her memoirs to her friend Olive Gilbert, and in 1850 William Lloyd Garrison privately published her book, \"The Narrative of Sojourner Truth: A Northern Slave\". That same year, she purchased a home in what would become the village of Florence in Northampton for $300, and spoke at the first National Women's Rights Convention in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1854, with proceeds from sales of the Narrative and cartes-de-visite entitled \"I sell the shadow to support the substance,\" she paid off the mortgage held by her friend from the Community, Samuel L. Hill.\n\nIn 1851, Truth joined George Thompson, an abolitionist and speaker, on a lecture tour through central and western New York State. In May, she attended the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio, where she delivered her famous extemporaneous speech on women's rights, later known as \"Ain't I a Woman.\" Her speech demanded equal human rights for all women as well as for all blacks. Advocating for women and African Americans was dangerous and challenging enough, but being one and doing so was far more difficult. The pressures and severity of her speech did not get to Truth, however. Truth took to the stage with a demanding and composed presence. Audience members were baffled by the way she carried herself and were hesitant to believe that she was even a woman, prompting the name of her speech \"Ain't I a Woman?\" The convention was organized by Hannah Tracy and Frances Dana Barker Gage, who both were present when Truth spoke. Different versions of Truth's words have been recorded, with the first one published a month later in the \"Anti-Slavery Bugle\" by Rev. Marius Robinson, the newspaper owner and editor who was in the audience. Robinson's recounting of the speech included no instance of the question \"Ain't I a Woman?\" Nor did any of the other newspapers reporting of her speech at the time. Twelve years later, in May 1863, Gage published another, very different, version. In it, Truth's speech pattern had characteristics of Southern slaves, and the speech was vastly different than the one Robinson had reported. Gage's version of the speech became the historic standard version, and is known as \"Ain't I a Woman?\" because that question was repeated four times. It is highly unlikely that Truth's own speech pattern was Southern in nature, as she was born and raised in New York, and she spoke only upper New York State low-Dutch until she was nine years old.\n\nIn contrast to Robinson's report, Gage's 1863 version included Truth saying her 13 children were sold away from her into slavery. Truth is widely believed to have had five children, with one sold away, and was never known to boast more children. Gage's 1863 recollection of the convention conflicts with her own report directly after the convention: Gage wrote in 1851 that Akron in general and the press in particular were largely friendly to the woman's rights convention, but in 1863 she wrote that the convention leaders were fearful of the \"mobbish\" opponents. Other eyewitness reports of Truth's speech told a calm story, one where all faces were \"beaming with joyous gladness\" at the session where Truth spoke; that not \"one discordant note\" interrupted the harmony of the proceedings. In contemporary reports, Truth was warmly received by the convention-goers, the majority of whom were long-standing abolitionists, friendly to progressive ideas of race and civil rights. In Gage's 1863 version, Truth was met with hisses, with voices calling to prevent her from speaking.\n\nAccording to Frances Gage's recount in 1863, Truth argued, \"That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody helps \"me\" any best place. \"And ain't I a woman?\"\" Truth's \" Ain't I a Woman\" showed the lack of recognition that Black women received during this time and whose lack of recognition will continue to be seen long after her time. \" Black women, of course, were virtually invisible within the protracted campaign for woman suffrage\" as said by Davis supports Truth's argument that nobody gives her \"any best place\" but not only her but Black women in general.\n\nOver the next 10 years, Truth spoke before dozens, perhaps hundreds, of audiences. From 1851 to 1853, Truth worked with Marius Robinson, the editor of the Ohio \"Anti-Slavery Bugle\", and traveled around that state speaking. In 1853, she spoke at a suffragist \"mob convention\" at the Broadway Tabernacle in New York City; that year she also met Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1856, she traveled to Battle Creek, Michigan, to speak to a group called the \"Friends of Human Progress.\" In 1858, someone interrupted a speech and accused her of being a man; Truth opened her blouse and revealed her breasts.\"\n\nNorthampton Camp Meeting—-1844, Northampton, Massachusetts: At a camp meeting where she was participating as an itinerant preacher, a band of \"wild young men\" disrupted the camp meeting, refused to leave, and threatened to burn down the tents. Truth caught the sense of fear pervading the worshipers and hid behind a trunk in her tent, thinking that since she was the only black person present, the mob would attack her first. However, she reasoned with herself and resolved to do something: as the noise of the mob increased and a female preacher was \"trembling on the preachers' stand,\" Truth went to a small hill and began to sing \"in her most fervid manner, with all the strength of her most powerful voice, the hymn on the resurrection of Christ.\" Her song, \"It was Early in the Morning,\" gathered the rioters to her and quieted them. They urged her to sing, preach, and pray for their entertainment. After singing songs and preaching for about an hour, Truth bargained with them to leave after one final song. The mob agreed and left the camp meeting.\n\nAbolitionist Convention—-1840s, Boston, Massachusetts: William Lloyd Garrison invited Sojourner Truth to give a speech at an annual antislavery convention. Wendell Phillips was supposed to speak after her, which made her nervous since he was known as such a good orator. So Truth sang a song, \"I am Pleading for My people,\" which was her own original composition sung to the tune of Auld Lang Syne.\n\nMob Convention—September 7, 1853: At the convention, young men greeted her with \"a perfect storm,\" hissing and groaning. In response, Truth said, \"You may hiss as much as you please, but women will get their rights anyway. You can't stop us, neither\". Sojourner, like other public speakers, often adapted her speeches to how the audience was responding to her. In her speech, Sojourner speaks out for women's rights. She incorporates religious references in her speech, particularly the story of Esther. She then goes on to say that, just as women in scripture, women today are fighting for their rights. Moreover, Sojourner scolds the crowd for all their hissing and rude behavior, reminding them that God says to \"Honor thy father and thy mother.\"\n\nAmerican Equal Rights Association—May 9–10, 1867: Her speech was addressed to the American Equal Rights Association, and divided into three sessions. Sojourner was received with loud cheers instead of hisses, now that she had a better-formed reputation established. \"The Call\" had advertised her name as one of the main convention speakers. For the first part of her speech, she spoke mainly about the rights of black women. Sojourner argued that because the push for equal rights had led to black men winning new rights, now was the best time to give black women the rights they deserve too. Throughout her speech she kept stressing that \"we should keep things going while things are stirring\" and fears that once the fight for colored rights settles down, it would take a long time to warm people back up to the idea of colored women's having equal rights.\n\nIn the second sessions of Sojourner's speech, she utilized a story from the Bible to help strengthen her argument for equal rights for women. She ended her argument by accusing men of being self-centered, saying, \"man is so selfish that he has got women's rights and his own too, and yet he won't give women their rights. He keeps them all to himself.\" For the final session of Sojourner's speech, the center of her attention was mainly on women's right to vote. Sojourner told her audience that she owned her own house, as did other women, and must therefore pay taxes. Nevertheless, they were still unable to vote because they were women. Black women who were enslaved were made to do hard manual work, such as building roads. Sojourner argues that if these women were able to perform such tasks, then they should be allowed to vote because surely voting is easier than building roads.\n\nEighth Anniversary of Negro Freedom—New Year's Day, 1871: On this occasion the Boston papers related that \"...seldom is there an occasion of more attraction or greater general interest. Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded\". She starts off her speech by giving a little background about her own life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God that she may have good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.\nThat last part of Sojourner's speech brings in her main focus. Some freed enslaved people were living on government aid at that time, paid for by taxpayers. Sojourner announces that this is not any better for those colored people than it is for the members of her audience. She then proposes that black people are given their own land. Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the United States was not well suited for colored people. She goes on to suggest that colored people be given land out west to build homes and prosper on.\n\nSecond Annual Convention of the American Woman Suffrage Association—Boston, 1871: In a brief speech, Truth argued that women's rights were essential, not only to their own well-being, but \"for the benefit of the whole creation, not only the women, but all the men on the face of the earth, for they were the mother of them.\"\n\nIn 1856, Truth bought a neighboring lot in Northampton, but she did not keep the new property for long. On September 3, 1857, she sold all her possessions, new and old, to Daniel Ives and moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, where she rejoined former members of the Millerite Movement who had formed the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Antislavery movements had begun early in Michigan and Ohio. Here, she also joined the nucleus of the Michigan abolitionists, the Progressive Friends, some who she had already met at national conventions. According to the 1860 census, her household in Harmonia included her daughter, Elizabeth Banks (age 35), and her grandsons James Caldwell (misspelled as \"Colvin\"; age 16) and Sammy Banks (age 8).\n\nDuring the Civil War, Truth helped recruit black troops for the Union Army. Her grandson, James Caldwell, enlisted in the 54th Massachusetts Regiment. In 1864, Truth was employed by the National Freedman's Relief Association in Washington, D.C., where she worked diligently to improve conditions for African-Americans. In October of that year, she met President Abraham Lincoln. In 1865, while working at the Freedman's Hospital in Washington, Truth rode in the streetcars to help force their desegregation.\n\nTruth is credited with writing a song, \"\", for the 1st Michigan Colored Regiment; it was said to be composed during the war and sung by her in Detroit and Washington, D.C. It is sung to the tune of \"John Brown's Body\" or \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\". Although Truth claimed to have written the words, it has been disputed (see \"Marching Song of the First Arkansas\").\n\nIn 1867, Truth moved from Harmonia to Battle Creek. In 1868, she traveled to western New York and visited with Amy Post, and continued traveling all over the East Coast. At a speaking engagement in Florence, Massachusetts, after she had just returned from a very tiring trip, when Truth was called upon to speak she stood up and said \"Children, I have come here like the rest of you, to hear what I have to say.\"\n\nIn 1870, Truth tried to secure land grants from the federal government to former enslaved people, a project she pursued for seven years without success. While in Washington, D.C., she had a meeting with President Ulysses S. Grant in the White House. In 1872, she returned to Battle Creek, became active in Grant's presidential re-election campaign, and even tried to vote on Election Day, but was turned away at the polling place.\n\nTruth spoke about abolition, women's rights, prison reform, and preached to the Michigan Legislature against capital punishment. Not everyone welcomed her preaching and lectures, but she had many friends and staunch support among many influential people at the time, including Amy Post, Parker Pillsbury, Frances Gage, Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Laura Smith Haviland, Lucretia Mott, Ellen G. White, and Susan B. Anthony.\"\n\nSeveral days before Sojourner Truth died, a reporter came from the \"Grand Rapids Eagle\" to interview her. \"Her face was drawn and emaciated and she was apparently suffering great pain. Her eyes were very bright and mind alert although it was difficult for her to talk.\" Truth died at her Battle Creek home on November 26, 1883. On November 28 her funeral was held at the Congregational-Presbyterian Church officiated by its pastor, the Reverend Reed Stuart. Some of the prominent citizens of Battle Creek acted as pall-bearers. Truth was buried in the city's Oak Hill Cemetery.\n\nThe calendar of saints of the Episcopal Church remembers Sojourner Truth annually, together with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Amelia Bloomer and Harriet Ross Tubman on July 20. The calendar of saints of the Lutheran Church remembers Sojourner Truth together with Harriet Tubman on March 10.\n\nA larger-than-life sculpture of Sojourner Truth by artist Tina Allen, was dedicated in 1999, which is the estimated bicentennial of Sojourner's birth. The 12-foot tall Sojourner monument is cast bronze.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department announced in 2016 that an image of Sojourner Truth will appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul and the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession. Designs for new $5, $10 and $20 bills will be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote via the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n\nOther honors and commemorations include (by year):\n\nAs of March 2015, K-12 schools in several states, including California, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Oregon, are named after her, as is Sojourner–Douglass College in Baltimore.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3430147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3430147", "title": "Untermensch", "text": "Untermensch\n\nUntermensch (, \"underman\", \"sub-man\", \"subhuman\"; plural: \"Untermenschen\") is a term that became infamous when the Nazis used it to describe non-Aryan \"inferior people\" often referred to as \"the masses from the East\", that is Jews, Roma, and Slavs – mainly ethnic Poles, Serbs, and later also Russians. The term was also applied to most Blacks, and persons of color. Jewish people were to be exterminated in the Holocaust, along with Romani people, and the physically and mentally disabled. According to the \"Generalplan Ost\", the Slavic population of East-Central Europe was to be reduced in part through mass murder in the Holocaust, with a majority expelled to Asia and used as slave labor in the Reich. These concepts were an important part of the Nazi racial policy.\n\nAlthough usually incorrectly considered to have been coined by the Nazis, the term \"under man\" was first used by American author and Klansman Lothrop Stoddard in the title of his 1922 book \"The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man\". Stoddard uses the term for those he considers unable to function in civilisation, which he generally (but not entirely) attributes on racial grounds. It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version \"Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen\" (1925).\n\nThe German word \"Untermensch\" had been used earlier, but not in a racial sense, for example in the 1899 novel \"Der Stechlin\" by Theodor Fontane. Since most writers who employed the term did not address the question of when and how the word entered the German language, \"Untermensch\" is usually translated into English as \"sub-human.\" The leading Nazi attributing the concept of the East-European \"under man\" to Stoddard is Alfred Rosenberg who, referring to Russian communists, wrote in his \"Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts\" (1930) that \"this is the kind of human being that Lothrop Stoddard has called the 'under man.'\" [\"...den Lothrop Stoddard als 'Untermenschen' bezeichnete.\"] Quoting Stoddard: \"The Under-Man – the man who measures under the standards of capacity and adaptability imposed by the social order in which he lives\".\n\nIt is possible that Stoddard constructed his \"under man\" as an opposite to Friedrich Nietzsche's \"Übermensch\" (superman) concept. Stoddard does not say so explicitly, but he refers critically to the \"superman\" idea at the end of his book (p. 262). Wordplays with Nietzsche's term seem to have been used repeatedly as early as the 19th century and, due to the German linguistic trait of being able to combine prefixes and roots almost at will in order to create new words, this development can be considered logical. For instance, German author Theodor Fontane contrasts the \"Übermensch/Untermensch\" word pair in chapter 33 of his novel \"Der Stechlin\". Nietzsche used \"Untermensch\" at least once in contrast to \"Übermensch\" in \"Die fröhliche Wissenschaft\" (1882); however, he did so in reference to semi-human creatures in mythology, naming them alongside dwarfs, fairies, centaurs and so on. Earlier examples of \"Untermensch\" include Romanticist Jean Paul using the term in his novel \"Hesperus\" (1795) in reference to an Orangutan (Chapter \"8. Hundposttag\").\n\nIn a speech in 1927 to the Bavarian regional parliament, the Nazi propagandist Julius Streicher, publisher of \"Der Stürmer,\" used the term \"Untermensch\" referring to the communists of the German Bavarian Soviet Republic:\n\nNazis repeatedly used the term \"Untermensch\" in writings and speeches directed against the Jews, the most notorious example being a 1942 SS publication with the title \"Der Untermensch\", which contains an antisemitic tirade sometimes considered to be an extract from a speech by Heinrich Himmler. In the pamphlet \"The SS as an Anti-Bolshevist Fighting Organization\", published in 1936, Himmler wrote:\nIn his speech \"Weltgefahr des Bolschewismus\" (\"World danger of Bolshevism\") in 1936, Joseph Goebbels said that \"subhumans exist in every people as a leavening agent\". At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels also declared that \"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\"\n\nAnother example of the use of the term \"Untermensch\", this time in connection with anti-Soviet propaganda, is a brochure entitled \"Der Untermensch\", edited by Himmler and distributed by the Race and Settlement Head Office. SS-Obersturmführer Ludwig Pröscholdt, Jupp Daehler and SS-Hauptamt-Schulungsamt Koenig are associated with its production. Published in 1942 after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, it is around 50 pages long and consists for the most part of photos portraying the enemy in an extremely negative way (see link below for the title page). 3,860,995 copies were printed in the German language. It was translated into Greek, French, Dutch, Danish, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Czech and seven other languages. The pamphlet says the following:\n\nNazis classified those they called the sub-humans into different types; they placed priority on extermination of the Jews, and exploitation of others as slaves.\n\nHistorian Robert Jan van Pelt writes that for the Nazis, \"it was only a small step to a rhetoric pitting the European Mensch against the Soviet \"Untermensch\", which had come to mean a Russian in the clutches of Judeo-Bolshevism.\"\n\nThe \"Untermensch\" concept included Jews, Roma and Sinti (Gypsies), and Slavic peoples such as Poles, Serbs and Russians. The Slavs were regarded as \"Untermenschen\", barely fit for exploitation as slaves. Hitler and Goebbels compared them to the \"rabbit family\" or to \"stolid animals\" that were \"idle\" and \"disorganized\" and spread like a \"wave of filth\". However, some among the Slavs who happened to have Nordic racial features were deemed to have distant Germanic descent which meant partially \"Aryan\" origin, and if under 10 years old, they were to be Germanized (see: kidnapping of children by Nazi Germany).\n\nThe Nazi views on the Slavs were explicitly contemptuous, as even prior to the World War II, Slavs, particularly the Poles, were deemed as being inferior to Germans. After Adolf Hitler gained political power in Germany, the concept of Non-Aryan \"sub-human slave-material\" was developed and started to be used also towards other Slavic peoples. Poles and Serbs were at the bottom of the Slavic \"racial hierarchy\" established by the Nazis. Soon after Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact expired, also Russians started to be seen as part of the \"subhuman\" race. Similarly, also Belarusians, Czechs, Slovaks, and Ukrainians were considered to be inferior, despite some collaborative groups were found among these nations. Nonetheless, there were Slavs such as Bosniaks, Bulgarians, and Croats who collaborated with Nazi Germany that were still being perceived as not racially \"pure\" enough to reach the status of Germanic peoples, yet they were eventually considered ethnically better than all other Slavs, mostly due to pseudoscientific theories about these nations having a minimal amount of Slavic genes and considerable admixtures of Germanic and Turkic blood. \n\nIn order to forge a strategic alliance with the Independent State of Croatia – a puppet state created after the invasion of Yugoslavia – and the Kingdom of Bulgaria, the Nazis deviated from a strict interpretation of their racial ideology, and Croats were officially described as \"more Germanic than Slav\", a notion supported by Croatia's fascist dictator Ante Pavelić who maintained that the \"Croatians were descendants of the ancient Goths\" and \"had the Panslav idea forced upon them as something artificial\". However the Nazi regime continued to classify Croats as a \"subhuman\" in spite of the alliance. Hitler also deemed the Bulgarians to be \"Turkoman\" in origin.\n\nWhile the Nazis were inconsistent in the implementation of their policy – for instance, mostly implementing the Final Solution while also implementing Generalplan Ost – the democidal death toll was in tens of millions of victims. It is related to the concept of \"life unworthy of life\", a more specific term which originally referred to the severely disabled who were involuntarily euthanised in Action T4, and was eventually applied to the extermination of the Jews.\n\nIn the directive No. 1306 by Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from October 24th 1939, the term \"Untermensch\" is used in reference to Polish ethnicity and culture, as follows: \n\nBiology classes in Nazi Germany schools taught about differences between the race of Nordic German \"Übermenschen\" and \"ignoble\" Jewish and Slavic \"subhumans\". The view that Slavs were subhuman was widespread among the German masses, and chiefly applied to the Poles. It continued to find support after the war.\n\nDuring the war, Nazi propaganda instructed Wehrmacht officers told their soldiers to target people described as \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\" and that the war in the Soviet Union was between the Germans and the Jewish, Gypsies and Slavic \"Untermenschen\".\n\nDuring the Warsaw Uprising, Himmler ordered the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto because according to him it allowed the \"living space\" of 500,000 subhumans.\n\nAs a pragmatic way to solve military manpower shortages, the Nazis used soldiers from some Slavic countries, firstly from the Reich's allies Croatia and Bulgaria and also within occupied territories. The concept of the Slavs in particular being \"Untermenschen\" served the Nazis' political goals; it was used to justify their expansionist policy and especially their aggression against Poland and the Soviet Union in order to achieve \"Lebensraum\", particularly in Ukraine. Early plans of the German Reich (summarized as \"Generalplan Ost\") envisioned the displacement, enslavement, and elimination of no fewer than 50 million people, who were not considered fit for Germanization, from territories it wanted to conquer in Europe; Ukraine's chernozem (\"black earth\") soil was considered a particularly desirable zone for colonization by the \"Herrenvolk\" (\"master race\").\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}
{"id": "36496677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36496677", "title": "Watsonville riots", "text": "Watsonville riots\n\nThe Watsonville riots was a period of racial violence which took place in Watsonville, California from January 19 to January 23, 1930. Involving altercations between Filipino American farm workers and local residents opposed to immigration, the riots highlighted the racial and socioeconomic tensions in California's agricultural communities.\n\nAs U.S. nationals, Filipinos had the legal right to work in the United States, and as early as 1906 they were working on Hawaii's sugar and pineapple plantations as full-time laborers. Assuming the Filipino workers' unfamiliarity with their rights, employers paid \"sakadas\" the lowest wages among all ethnic laborers; and Filipinos were introduced as strikebreakers as part of a divide and rule strategy to prevent cross-ethnic mobilization and thereby ensure smooth production processes .\n\nThe Immigration Acts of 1917 and 1924, which targeted non-whites of Asian descent, allowed Filipinos to answer the growing demand for labor on the U.S. mainland. From the 1920s on, \"overwhelmingly young, single, and male\" Filipinos migrated to the Pacific Coast, joining Mexicans in positions previously filled by Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Indians. In California, Filipinos were the dominant Asian farm labor force during the next two decades.\n\nFilipino laborers' resilience in harsh working conditions made them favorite recruits among farm operators. In California's Santa Clara and San Joaquin Valleys, Filipinos were often assigned to the backbreaking work of cultivating and harvesting asparagus, celery, and lettuce. As in Hawaii, the industry and perceived passivity of these little brown brothers were used to counter the so-called \"laziness\" of working-class whites and other ethnic groups.\n\nDue to gender bias in immigration policy and hiring practices, of the 30,000 Filipino laborers following the cycle of seasonal farm work, only 1 in 14 were women. Unable to meet Filipinas, Filipino farm workers sought the companionship of women outside their own ethnic community, which further aggravated mounting racial discord.\n\nIn the next few years, white men decrying the takeover of jobs and white women by Filipinos resorted to vigilantism to deal with the \"third Asiatic invasion.\" Filipino laborers frequenting pool halls or attending street fairs in Stockton, Dinuba, Exeter, and Fresno risked being attacked by nativists threatened by the swelling labor pool as well as the Filipino's presumed predatory sexual nature.\n\nIn October 1929, Filipinos at a street carnival in Exeter were shot with rubber bands as they walked with their white female companions. In response to the knifing of a heckler, a mob of 300 white men led by then Chief of Police C. E. Joyner burned the barn of a rancher known to hire Filipinos; and Joyner ordered the shutdown of a nearby labor camp. According to local press, the riot was caused primarily by Filipinos' insistence on equal treatment by white women.\n\nTwo months later, in the morning of December 2, 1929, in Watsonville, a coastal town 189 miles (304 km) away, police raided a boardinghouse and found two white girls, aged 16 and 11, sleeping in the same room with Perfecto Bandalan, a 25-year-old lettuce grower. The Watsonville community was outraged and remained so even after learning that Bandalan and 16-year-old Esther Schmick were engaged, and that they were caring for Esther's sister Bertha at her mother's request.\n\nNear midnight on January 18, 1930, 500 white men and youths gathered outside a Filipino dance club in the Palm Beach section of Watsonville. The club was owned by a Filipino man and offered dances with the nine white women who lived there. The mob came with clubs and weapons intending to take the women out and burn the place down. The owners threatened to shoot if the rioters persisted, and when the mob refused to leave, the owners opened fire. Police broke up the fight with gas bombs. Two days later, on January 20, a group of Filipino men met with a group of white men near the Pajaro River bridge to settle the score. A group of hispanic men then arrived and took sides with the whites. The riot began and continued for five days.\n\nHunting parties were organized; the white mob was run like a \"military\" operation with leaders giving orders to attack or withdraw. They dragged Filipinos from their homes and beat them. They threw Filipinos off the Pajaro River bridge. They ranged up the San Juan road to attack Filipinos at the Storm and Detlefsen ranches; at Riberal's labor camp, twenty-two Filipinos were dragged out and beaten almost to death. A Chinese apple-dryer that employed Filipinos was demolished; shots were fired into a Filipino home on Ford Street; and 22-year-old Fermin Tobera died after being shot in the heart when he was hiding in a closet with 11 others, trying to avoid the rounds of bullets fired at a bunkhouse in Murphy Ranch in San Juan Road on the 23rd.\n\nThe police in Watsonville, led by Sheriff Nick Sinnott, gathered as many Filipinos as they could rescue and guarded them in the City Council's chamber while Monterey County Sheriff Carl Abbott secured the Pajaro side of the river against further riot.\n\nThe mob finally went home on the 25th.\n\nThe violence spread to Stockton, San Francisco, San Jose, and other cities. A Filipino club was blown up in Stockton, and the blast was blamed on the Filipinos themselves. In Gilroy, masked men warned a Japanese farmer to discharge his Filipinos. Fifty unemployed whites and Filipinos were hustled out of town by police, trying to preempt possible fighting.\n\nMany Filipinos fled the country. News of the riots spread to the Philippines, where there were protests in solidarity. The body of Fermin Tobera was sent to Manila, where he is considered a martyr, a symbol of the Filipinos' fight for independence and equality.\n\nThe five days of the Watsonville riots had a profound impact on California's attitude toward imported Asian labor. As a result, Filipino immigration plummeted, and while they remained a significant part of the labor in the fields, they began to be replaced by Mexicans.\n\nYet, seven months after the Watsonville riots, Filipino lettuce pickers carried out a successful strike in Salinas for better treatment. These strikes were repeated again in the Salinas Lettuce Strike of 1934 and in 1936. In addition, although their relationships were frowned upon, white women and Filipino men continued to meet and marry.\n\nIn September 4, 2011, California apologized to Filipinos and Filipino Americans in an Assembly resolution authored by Assemblyman Luis Alejo, D-Salinas. \"Filipino Americans have a proud history of hard work and perseverance,\" Alejo said in a statement. \"California, however, does not have as proud a history regarding its treatment of Filipino Americans. For these past injustices, it's time that we recognize the pain and suffering this community has endured.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "37198049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37198049", "title": "World War II looting of Poland", "text": "World War II looting of Poland\n\nThe looting of Polish cultural artifacts during World War II was carried out by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union side by side after the invasion of Poland of 1939. A significant portion of Poland's cultural heritage, estimated at about half a million art objects, was plundered by the occupying powers. Cataloged pieces are still occasionally recovered elsewhere and returned to Poland.\n\nPriceless pieces of art still considered missing or found in Russian museums include works by Canaletto, Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowiczowa, Józef Brandt, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Younger, Albrecht Dürer, Anthony van Dyck, Hans Holbein the Younger, Jacob Jordaens, Frans Luycx, Jacek Malczewski, Raphael, Rembrandt van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, Henryk Siemiradzki, Veit Stoss, Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski, Leon Wyczółkowski, Jan Matejko, Henri Gervex, Ludwig Buchhorn, Józef Simmler, Henri-Pierre Danloux, Jan Miense Molenaer and many others.\n\nAs part of the efforts to locate and retrieve the missing pieces of art, the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage founded the Database of War Losses, as of 2013 containing over 63,000 entries. The list is periodically sent to over 100 auction houses around the world, published by the Ministry and also submitted to the National Institute of Museology and Collections Protection, Polish embassies, and the Central Registry of Information on Looted Cultural Property 1933-1945 (lootedart.com). In addition, the Ministry also founded the Lost Museum website, a virtual museum containing historic photographs of many pieces of art still missing.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1939 invasion of Poland, the Polish interwar government attempted to conceal the nation's most valued cultural heritage such as the royal treasures of the Wawel Castle in Kraków. The royal accessories including the Jagiellonian tapestries were secretly shipped to Western Europe and then to Canada among other places. At the end of the war, two parallel Polish governments, the Western-supported Polish government-in-exile and the Soviet-backed government in Communist Poland laid claims to these national treasures. The cultural artifacts were released by Canada to the People's Republic of Poland in February 1961.\n\nFollowing the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the occupation of Poland by German forces, the Nazi regime attempted to suppress Polish culture. As part of that process, the Nazis confiscated Polish national heritage assets and much private property. Acting on the legal decrees of October 19 and December 16 (\"Verordnung über die Beschlagnahme Kunstgegeständen im Generalgouvernement\"), several German agencies began the process of looting Polish museums and other collections, ostensibly considered necessary for the \"securing\" of German national interests.\n\nThousands of art objects were plundered, as the Nazis carried out a plan put in place before the start of hostilities. The looting was supervised by experts of the \"SS\"-\"Ahnenerbe\", \"Einsatzgruppen\" units, who were responsible for art; and, by experts of \"Haupttreuhandstelle Ost\", who were responsible for confiscating businesses and more mundane objects. Nazi officials responsible for carrying-out the plan included Hans Posse, Josef Mühlmann and his half-brother Kajetan (a.k.a. Kai, both from the SS), overseen by Dagobert Frey, an SS historian originally also from Austria, selected by Berlin to validate Poland as a \"Teutonic land\" without Jews. In addition to the official looting by Nazi authorities, some looting was also carried out by individuals acting on their own initiative; in fact Mühlmann complained as early as on October 6, 1939, that many items he was tasked to secure had already been moved or simply stolen. While the Nazis kept extensive documentation of newly acquired looted art pieces, the system was not foolproof, and they lost track of much of the looted goods during the increasingly haphazard evacuation of Polish territories in 1944.\n\nMost of the important art pieces had been \"secured\" by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that \"over 90%\" of the art previously in Poland was in their possession. Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned \"Führermuseum\" in Linz, while other art became the private property of Nazi officials. In 1940, Hitler received a \"gift\" from Hans Frank, governor of occupied Poland - a collection, prepared by Mühlmann, of 521 of the most valuable art pieces. Frank aided by \"Oberführer\" Mühlmann, an art connoisseur, amassed a large collection of Polish art pieces. The total cost of the Nazi theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 11.14 billion dollars (value in 2001 dollars).\n\nOver 516,000 individual art pieces were taken. The exact number is uncertain as not all art was registered, and much of that documentation was lost as well. Assessment of losses began during World War II under the auspices of the Polish government in exile and the Polish Underground State; in 1944, Karol Estreicher published in London the first work on this subject, \"Cultural Losses of Poland\". A 2010 estimate gave a figure of 75% for the percentage of cultural heritage lost by Poland during the war (though that estimate covers both destroyed and lost cultural heritage). The looted art included 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 2,800 paintings by other European painters; 1,400 sculptures; 75,000 manuscripts; 25,000 maps, 22,000 books printed before 1800 (\"starodruki\"); 300,000 graphics, and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value. The number of looted or destroyed books is estimated at 1.5 million to as high as 15 or 22 million. Even exotic animals were taken from the zoos.\n\nDuring the genocidal campaign against the Polish Jews culminating in the \"Aktion Reinhard\" of 1942, extortion and mass looting became part of German economics, not only Nazi policy towards Poland's heritage. \n\nAfter the Soviet Union invaded Poland on September 17, 1939, it similarly engaged in the looting and destruction of the Polish cultural heritage. It is estimated that soon after the invasion, about half of Polish museums and similar public institutions were dismantled in the territories occupied by the Soviets. Many items were shipped to Soviet museums such as the Moscow Museum of History and the Central Anti-Religious Museum (also in Moscow). Other collections were simply done away with. For instance, during the liquidation of the Poland's \"Lwów Historical Museum\" in the early 1940, its holdings were transported to the basement of the Black (\"Czarna\") Kamienica \"(pictured)\", away from public eye, and deliberately destroyed there.\n\nFollowing the Soviet advance across the German-occupied Polish lands, the looting and plunder of anything of value continued up to 1947 even though the looted territories were theoretically assigned to its own ally, the communist Poland already. The Soviet forces engaged in particularly extensive plunder in the former eastern territories of Germany that were to be transferred to Poland, stripping them of any piece of equipment left behind. Even the Polish Communists felt uneasy about the scope of their crimes. In 1945, the future Chairman of the Polish Council of State, Gen. Aleksander Zawadzki, worried that \"raping and looting of the Soviet army would provoke a civil war\"\n\nThe operations of these \"war trophy brigades\" were regulated by detailed orders issued by Soviet vice-minister of defence Nikolai Bulganin in early 1946. Until 1948 these brigades sent at least 239'000 freight cars to USSR transporting natural resources, complete factories and individual machines. Town of Bydgoszcz lost 30 complete factories and 250 ships, from Grudziądz the army confiscated all machinery from factories, regardless of their size. From Toruń all gristmills were taken, causing temporary deficit of bread. Blachownia Śląska lost a large, German-built synthetic fuel producing installation, transported to USSR on 10,000 train cars. A similar production line in Police was transported using 14,000 cars. Gliwice lost a pipe factory, Bobrek and Łabędy - iron furnaces. Complete power stations were taken from Miechowice, Zabrze, Zdzieszowice, Mikulczyce, Blachownia Śląska i Chełmsk Śląski. Smaller industries were also confiscated in Sosnowiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Częstochowa, Zgoda, Chorzów, Siemianowice, Poznań, Bydgoszcz, Grudziądz, Toruń, Inowrocław, Włocławek, Chojnice, Łódź, Dziedzice and Oświęcim.\n\nFarming animals were also significant target of looting: until 1 September 1945 the Red Army confiscated 506,000 cows, 114,000 sheep and 206,000 horses. In February 1945 alone over 72,000 tons of sugar was taken. In Toruń region alone 14,000 tons of grain, 20,000 of potatoes and 21,000 beetroots were taken during that period. These number represent looting alone, as the Polish government also supplied food to the Red Army officially at that time (150,000 tons of grains, 250,000 tons of potatoes, 25,000 tons of meat and 100,000 tons of straws).\n\nIndividual Red Army soldiers were also allowed to send home \"war trophies\", with the weight depending on their rank, which resulted in widespread looting of private houses of anything valuable, including food, clothes, shoes, radios, jewelry, utensils, clothes, bicycles, and even ceramic toilet bowls. Scale of individual looting can be estimated by the example of Russian town of Kursk, which received only 300 personal parcels from soldiers in January 1945 but till May their number reached 87,000.\n\nAfter these transports were finished, the Red Army also started looting the train infrastructure itself—repair yards, signalling installations and the rails themselves: around 5,500 km of rails were looted.\n\nIn 1946 the scale of looting was estimated by Polish authorities at 2.375 billions of 1938 dollars (equivalent of $54 billion in 2015 dollars).\n\nAfter the war, the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art took over efforts to compile a list of lost art, locate it and recover it. The Bureau of Revindication and Damages (\"Biuro Rewindykacji i Odszkodowań\") operated from 1945 to 1951. The realities of the Cold War made retrieval of looted cultural heritage difficult, and it was only in the 1980s and 1990s that the situation changed. In 1991, a new body was formed for that purpose, the Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad (\"Biuro Pełnomocnika Rządu ds. Polskiego Dziedzictwa Kulturalnego Za Granicą\"), operating at the Ministry of Culture and Art. In 1999, the initiative received support from the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Once a looted piece of art is located, the Polish government issues a request for its restoration, and as noted on the Ministry website, all requests to date have been successful. , the Ministry listed 30 objects which had been retrieved in the years 2001-2012. Among the recovered art is the Aleksander Gierymski's \"Jewish Woman\"—found by surprise at the \"Eva Aldag\" auction house in Buxtehude in November 2010, returned to National Museum, Warsaw at the end of July 2011 and restored.\nOn 1 August 2012, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that one of the most famous pieces of Polish art, Raphael's painting \"Portrait of a Young Man\", had been found \"in a bank vault in an undisclosed location\"; a ministry spokesman was confident that the painting would eventually be returned to Poland. In April 2014, Francesco Guardi's \"Palace Stairs\" was recovered.\n\nCurrently, Poland is planning to build a virtual museum, the Lost Museum (), which would feature the lost art.\n\nBoth Germany and the countries of the former Soviet Union still have much Polish material looted during World War II. In particular, recovering looted art from the former states of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, is proving difficult.\n\n\n"}
