{"id": "22654884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22654884", "title": "Albanians in Bulgaria", "text": "Albanians in Bulgaria\n\nAlbanians (, \"albantsi\") are a minority ethnic group in Bulgaria (). Although according to the 2001 census they only numbered 278, their number in the Bulgarian lands was much larger in the past. Between the 15th and 17th century, groups of Albanians (both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox by confession) settled in many parts of modern northern Bulgaria, with a less numerous group of settlers in southern Thrace.\n\nSome of the earliest Albanian settlers in modern Bulgaria were the Roman Catholic ore miners in Kopilovtsi, Montana Province, a village in the vicinity of the larger mining centre Chiprovtsi. Kopilovtsi was settled between the 15th and the 17th century; a Catholic church was built in the early 17th century. Unlike the Catholic population in other villages of the region, Kopilovtsi's residents were of Albanian origin. In 1626, the Archbishop of Bar Pjetër Mazreku claims that part of the Bulgarian Catholics are Albanians (\"Albanesi\"), Saxons and Paulicians. According to Bulgarian bishop Petar Bogdan, Kopilovtsi had 1,200 Catholics of Albanian origin who were still speaking the Albanian language in 1640. In another report from 1647, Petar Bogdan also lists 1,200 Albanian Catholics in Kopilovtsi, but notes that they have started using Slavic instead. By 1658, Petar Bogdan notes that the over 1,500 Albanians in Kopilovtsi spoke Bulgarian and only retained some traces of their original language. Kopilovtsi, along with Chiprovtsi, was depopulated with the crushing of the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688.\n\nAlbanian settlement in northern Bulgaria was not limited to Catholics—in a 1595 letter to the Prince of Transylvania, Ragusan merchant Pavel Đorđić notes that \"in Bulgaria there are many villages inhabited by Albanians, from where 7,000 brave and well-trained men can be rallied\". In the same letter, Đorđić claims that 1,500 of those Albanians lived near Tarnovo.\n\nIndeed, the toponym Arbanasi, a village near the city of Tarnovo, is a hint at Albanian settlement in the region. Arbanasi was populated (or repopulated) in the late 15th century and as an administratively autonomous village in the Ottoman Empire attracted many settlers. It is theorized that the first settlers were around 100–200 Albanians who were brought there during Bayezid II's campaigns in Albania. These settlers were gradually Hellenized and Bulgarianized in the following centuries.\n\nOther places in northern Bulgaria where an Albanian presence has been strongly suggested are Chervena Voda near Rousse, Poroishte near Razgrad, Dobrina near Provadia and Devnya near Varna. Albanians have been registered in the modern Bulgarian capital Sofia since the early 17th century; other possible colonies south of the Balkan Mountains included Gorno Arbanasi and Dolno Arbanasi near Asenovgrad. The most notable Albanian village in Bulgarian Thrace is Mandritsa near Ivaylovgrad, which was settled in the first half of the 17th century by settlers from near Korçë. A church was built in 1718. The village reached its demographic peak before the Balkan Wars; in 1912, it was inhabited by 1,879 people.\n\nAfter the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1878, many Albanians arrived to the country as political immigrants. A patriotic organization of Albanians in Bulgaria, \"Longing\", was established on 1 January 1893 in Sofia and initially had 53 members. An Albanian-language printing press was founded shortly thereafter; besides calendars and newspapers, the printing house published important patriotic works of the National Renaissance of Albania, including publications by brothers Naim Frashëri and Sami Frashëri. Most notably, the text of the Albanian national anthem, Aleksander Stavre Drenova's \"Hymn to the Flag\", was first published in Sofia by the \"Freedom of Albania\" newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also possessed the land where Gabol Town and Jinnah International Airport are now located. Allah Bakhsh Gabol was the son of a landlord Khudadad Khan Gabol, and the grandfather of Nabil Gabol.\n\nGabol was the first Deputy Speaker of the Sindh Assembly, after the imposition of Government of India Act 1935 . He defeated Haji Sir Abdullah Haroon in 1937 in the first election after Sindh was separated from Bombay. He was also twice elected the Mayor of the then Karachi Municipal Corporation in 1953 and 1962. It is now the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. . Due to his outstanding status, he was awarded the title of Khan Bahadur by the British Empire and after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, he was awarded the Sitara i Imtiaz by President Ayub Khan in 1966. Thus he was considered to be an influential politician of Karachi of his times.\n\nKarachi is not only the cradle of the modern Balochi literary movement, but also the centre to uphold the modern Baloch political trends. Simultaneous with formation of the Anjuman, the Baloch literary class in Karachi formed a nationalist organisation, called the Baloch League. Gholam Mohammad Noor ud-Din, educated from Bombay, was appointed as its president. The other members of its leadership were: Waja Omar Bakhsh Sabera, a famous merchant, Maolavi Mohammad Osman, Mehrab Khan, Issa Khan, Maolavi Abdul Samad Sarbazi, Khan Sahib Osman, Pir Bakhsh Shahdad and Gabol. In its annual conference in 1930 the League condemned Magasi's imprisonment and openly demanded his immediate release from the British authorities. In the late 1930s, after his graduation from Aligarh University, the nationalist leader, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo also joined the League.\n\n|-\n"}

Jay Dinshah. The date of the earlier The Vegan Society (UK)'s founding, November 1, is now celebrated annually as World Vegan Day.\n\n\nPrior to broad and widely-accessible search capabilities of the Internet, the American Vegan Society published networking and business resources which supported vegan lifestyle.\n\nH. Jay Dinshah founded the American Vegan Society early in 1960 and later that year (August) married the English-born Freya Smith. Freya, whose parents were active in The Vegan Society (of England), contributed to the early growth of the American Vegan Society and is president of the American Vegan Society today. The American Vegan Society is headquartered at Malaga, New Jersey, on a parcel of land which is called \"SunCrest\", or \"the SunCrest Educreational Center.\" During Dinshah's life, the American Vegan Society was characterized by vegan publishing and outreach, annual vegan conferences, vegan archiving, spiritual inspiration, providing people with an experience of vegan living, vegan food-preparation demonstrations, maintenance of a small veganic garden, and extensive networking. Dinshah served the American Vegan Society as its president and as editor of its publication, Ahimsa magazine (1960–2000).\nAhimsa was a quarterly publication that explored compassionate living (\"Ahimsa\" meaning \"dynamic harmlessness\") as a philosophy, practical aspects of vegan living, and personal and cultural resources for vegans. Ahimsa included vegan menus and recipes, and news about food. The American Vegan Society continues to publish a quarterly periodical, now titled American Vegan, with the motto \"Ahimsa lights the way.\" The American Vegan Society is now led and managed by its president, Freya Dinshah and advised by the AVS Council of Trustees, all of whom are vegans, and operated by a team of staff and volunteers.\nThe American Vegan Society \"promotes, supports, and explores a compassionate, healthful, and sustainable lifestyle. The diet is plant-sourced, varied, and abundant. For ethical, health, environmental, and other reasons, (vegans) reject all animal products in food, clothing, and commodities, and the exploitation of animals for sport or entertainment. AVS is guided by the doctrines of Ahimsa (non-slaughter, non-violence) and Reverence for Life, and provides community and friendship to those following and learning about this way of living.\"\n\nDonald Watson in England (and possibly others) coined the term 'vegan' in 1944; it referred to an entirely plant-based diet (with or without spiritual or philosophical or ethical underpinnings). American Vegan Society used the term vegan to mean dynamic harmlessness and successfully developed a broad social base of practicing vegans who committed themselves to that meaning and practice.\n\nCatherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz formed a vegan society in California (1948 to 1960), and they both joined the American Vegan Society when Dinshah founded it in 1960. \n\nAnnual Conferences were held since 1960.\n\nAlternate conferences and conventions were held, largely in the northeastern US (New Jersey and New York) but also earlier in California, then later in California (Arcata), Colorado (Denver), Oregon (Portland), and Washington (Olympia), often sharing logistical responsibilities with local and regional vegetarian societies. For a number of years, beginning in 1989, convention proceedings were videotaped.\n\nThe Dinshahs conducted weekend workshops, cooking classes, and other educational programs at SunCrest in Malaga, as early as 1969, when their first building (headquarters) was donated.\n\nIn 1995, the AVS cohosted the 8th International Vegan Festival in San Diego California, with VUNA (Vegetarian Union of North America) and Vegans International (VI).\n\nIncomplete List of American Vegan Society conventions:\n\n\nSome of these conferences were:\n- Some annual conferences were in California during the 1960s\n\nAdditional Workshops\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38983645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38983645", "title": "Bancorex", "text": "Bancorex\n\nBancorex was the largest bank in Romania during the 1990s, accounting for more than a fourth of the banking market share when it was closed down in 1999. The bank failed due to non-performing loans that were related to political corruption, especially behind-the-scenes political dealings. The bank was bailed out by the Romanian state, its good assets being then merged with the more solvent Banca Comercială Română.\n\nIt was founded as the \"Banca Română de Comerț Exterior\" (\"Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade\") in 1968 and for decades it was the bank through which much of Romania's foreign trade was conducted.\n\nToward the end of 1997, Bancorex received a sum of $600 million from the government, representing 2% of Romania's GDP. The recapitalization was followed by a management change in April 1998, but not by a restructuring, and the situation of the bank further deteriorated. It was only in late 1998, when a crisis hit Bancorex again, that the government considered restructuring the bank, eyeing a privatization procedure.\n\nBy 1999, it became clear that a recapitalization of the bank would require $2 billion (almost 6% of Romania's GDP), which couldn't have been afforded by the government. A February 1999 estimate said that $1.7 billion (or 85-90% of its loan portfolio), much of it in foreign currency, was non-performing. This sum represented 5% of Romania's GDP at the time.\n\nIn April 1999, Bancorex collapsed as depositors lined up to get their savings out of the bank. In order to prevent further bank runs, the Romanian authorities decided upon a fast liquidation, transferring bad assets to a newly created Asset Recovery Agency, while deposits and most of the structure of Bancorex were absorbed by another state-owned bank, Banca Comercială Română. The banking license was withdrawn on July 31, 1999, effective August 2, 1999. The Romanian government compensated Banca Comercială Română for the liabilities transferred from Bancorex and it gave the right to refuse any assets of Bancorex.\n\nIn 1999, the government took into public debt from Bancorex a sum of $1.5 billion, or 4.5% of GDP, in addition to the 1997 recapitalization of $600 million and the assumption of some off-balance-sheet items and legal liabilities that have not been disclosed.\n\n"}

{"id": "39206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39206", "title": "Business", "text": "Business\n\nBusiness is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). Simply put, it is \"any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any such formal organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors.\" \n\nHaving a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.\n\nThe term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company. A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.\n\nForms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:\n\n\"Less common types of companies are:\"\nNote that \"Ltd after the company's name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.\"\n\nIn legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the \"members\". In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include \"segregated portfolio companies\" and restricted purpose companies.\n\nThere are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.\n\nCompanies are also sometimes distinguished for legal and regulatory purposes between public companies and private companies. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of an exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.\n\nA parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.\n\n\nAccounting is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494. Accounting, which has been called the \"language of business\", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \"accounting\" and \"financial reporting\" are often used as synonyms.\n\nFinance is a field that deals with the study of investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk. Finance can also be defined as the science of money management. Finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return. Finance can be broken into three different sub-categories: public finance, corporate finance and personal finance.\n\nManufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.\n\nMarketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as \"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\" The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.\n\nWith the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.\n\nResearch and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result. \n\nSafety is a key business concept that is defined by Merriam-Webster as “the condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss”. Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually. Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduces incidents, insurance costs and workers’ compensation claims. New technologies, like wearable safety devices and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the \"canary in the coalmine\" and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.\n\nSales are activity related to selling or the amount of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies' success.\n\nThe efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management. \n\nOwners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business' value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least six functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.\n\nIn recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People's Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system. Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.\n\nBusiness process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can, therefore, be described as a \"process optimization process\". It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach. \n\nMost legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law for each type.\n\nThe major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:\n\n\nMany businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate \"person\". This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner's own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.\n\nWhere two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a \"sole proprietor\", whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.\n\nA few relevant factors to consider in deciding how to operate a business include:\n\n\nA very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example, and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers. The word \"corporation\" derives from the Latin \"corpus\", meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.\n\nIn many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.\n\nSome specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.\n\nSome businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.\n\n When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.\n\nCapital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in other ways.\n\nMajor stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the USA), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.\n\nBusinesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers' compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).\n\nThe proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.\n\nOther types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.\n\nBusinesses often have important \"intellectual property\" that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee's interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.\n\nA trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.\n"}

While the term eventually came to refer to a territorial unit, the royal domain originally referred to the network of \"castles, villages and estates, forests, towns, religious houses and bishoprics, and the rights of justice, tolls and taxes\" effectively held by the king or under his domination. In terms of territory, before the reign of Henry IV, the \"domaine royal\" did not encompass the entirety of the territory of the kingdom of France and for much of the Middle Ages significant portions of the kingdom were the direct possessions of other feudal lords.\n\nIn the tenth and eleventh centuries, the first Capetians—while being the kings of France—were among the least powerful of the great feudal lords of France in terms of territory possessed. Patiently, through the use of feudal law (and, in particular, the confiscation of fiefs from rebellious vassals), conquest, annexation, skillful marriages with heiresses of large fiefs, and even by purchase, the kings of France were able to increase the royal domain. By the time of Philip IV, the meaning of \"royal domain\" began to shift from a mere collection of lands and rights to a fixed territorial unit, and by the sixteenth century the \"royal domain\" began to coincide with the entire kingdom. However, the medieval system of appanage (a concession of a fief with its land rights by the sovereign to his younger sons, which reverts to the crown upon the extinction of the male line of the original holder) alienated large territories from the royal domain and sometimes created dangerous rivals (especially the Duchy of Burgundy from the 14th to the 15th centuries).\n\nDuring the Wars of Religion, the alienation of lands and fiefs from the royal domain was frequently criticized. The Edict of Moulins (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line.\n\nTraditionally, the king was expected to survive from the revenues generated from the royal domain, but fiscal necessity, especially in times of war, led the kings to enact \"exceptional\" taxes, like the \"taille\", upon the whole of the kingdom (the \"taille\" became permanent in 1439).\n\nAt the beginning of Hugh Capet's reign, the crown estate was extremely small and consisted essentially of scattered possessions in the Île-de-France and Orléanais regions (Senlis, Poissy, Orléans), with several other isolated pockets, such as Attigny. These lands were largely the inheritance of the Robertians, the direct ancestors of the Capetians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the reign of Francis I, the concept of \"royal domain\" begins to coincide with the French kingdom in general; the appanage of the House of Bourbon however remains alienated.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8899789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8899789", "title": "Dramyin Cham", "text": "Dramyin Cham\n\nDramyin Cham (Dzongkha: Dramnyen Cham) is a form of Cham dance - a masked and costumed dance performed in Tibetan Buddhism ceremonies in Bhutan, Sikkim, Himalayan West Bengal and Tibet (where they have been outlawed). They are a focal point of the Bhutanese festivals of Tsechu. The \"Dramyin Cham\" is notable among Cham dances as the lead dancer keeps time with a dramyin - a Himalayan folk music lute, and not a traditional percussion instrument like the cymbals. This is among the few instances of monastic music in the Himalayas where the use of a stringed instrument has been observed.\n\nIn the 13th century, monks from southern Tibet established the Drukpa Lineage of the Kagyu school of Vajrayana in Bhutan. This is celebrated in the Dramyin Cham as well as in the religious song \"Dramyin Choeshay\". Specifically, the dance celebrates an incident in Tibetan Buddhist mythology - the victory of the saint Tsangpa Gyare (1161-1211) over a demon which was obstructing a pilgrimage path to Tsari, Tibet at the mouth of a valley. The saint apparently subjugated the demon by performing a dramyin cham and it offered its services to him and became the guardian deity of the valley.\n\nAll participants in the Dramyin Cham are male, similar to the conventions pertaining to other Cham dances. The costumes of the dancers reflect the costume of armed lamas who acted as bodyguards to the Drukpa high lamas. The basic costume consists of elaborate, heavy, woolen clothes, a long, black Tibetan robe (chuba) lined with red, and long, colorful felt boots. Below the chuba, they typically wear a striped shirt with brocaded collars and cuffs of red, green and white. The leaders of the dance also wear a brown, folded jacket. One of the leaders carries the dramyin, with which he keeps time. All the dancers wear traditional armoury, weaponry, and ornaments.\n\nThe 17th century legislator Ngawang Namgyal, the Zhabdrung Rinpoche (1594 - 1651), under whom the Drukpa Lineage flourished, composed the lyrics and music for most of the present day Cham dances (including the \"Dramyin Cham\"), and authored the seminal work Gar-Thig-Yang Sum. The book indicates how most dances (including the \"Dramyin Cham\") should be choreographed and rendered. With the exception of the introduction and the coda, the dance can and usually is performed in simple two-time. The dance includes symbolic references to stamping and subjugating the demon.\n"}

Such racial typologies have been rejected by modern anthropology for several reasons.\n\nThe term East Baltic race was coined by the anthropologist Rolf Nordenstreng, but was popularised by the race theorist Hans F. K. Günther. This race was living in Finland, Estonia and northern and central European Russia. It was characterized as \"short-headed, broad-faced, with heavy, massive under-jaw, chin not prominent, flat, rather broad, short nose with low bridge; stiff, light (ash-blond) hair; light (grey or whitish blue) eyes, standing out; light skin with a greyish undertone.\" Gunther also considered Poles to be predominantly of the \"East Baltic\" race, which he deemed inferior to the Nordic race,\nsaying: \"However, owing to contra-selection among the Nordic warrior ruling classes, the conquest through the birth-rate by the East Baltic race among the north and west Slavs, must have had its beginning, and soon have become definitive.\" \n\nThe American Eugenics Society described East Baltic people as being Mongolized.\n\nThe Nazi philologist Josef Nadler declared the East Baltic race to be the main source of German Romanticism. Also in the Third Reich the philologist Julius Petersen wrote that Ludwig Tieck's Romanticism might have been promoted by his possible Slavic heritage, referring to the American biographer Edwin H. Zeydel's theory, that Tieck's grandmother was Russian.\n\n"}

They historically spoke the El Molo language as a mother tongue, an Afro-Asiatic language of the Cushitic branch, and now most El Molo speak Samburu.\n\nThe El Molo are believed to have originally migrated down into the Turkana Basin around 1000 BC from Ethiopia in the more northerly Horn region. Owing to the arid environment in which they entered, they are held to have then abandoned agricultural activities in favor of lakeside fishing.\n\nHistorically, the El Molo erected tomb structures in which they placed their dead. A 1962 archaeological survey in the Northern Frontier District led by S. Brodribb Pughe observed hieroglyphics on a number of these constructions. They were mainly found near springs or wells of water.\n\nThe El Molo today primarily inhabit the northern Eastern Province of Kenya. They are concentrated in Marsabit District on the southeast shore of Lake Turkana, between El Molo bay and Mount Kulal. In the past, they also dwelled in other parts of the Northern Frontier District.\n\nAccording to the 2009 Kenya census, there were 2,840 El Molo residents. However, historians have noted that there are few \"pure\" El Molo left. Most group members are today admixed with adjacent Nilotic populations, primarily Samburu, with only a handful of unmixed El Molo believed to exist. Many El Molo speakers have also adopted cultural customs from these communities. In 1994, there were reportedly only eight unmixed El Molo remaining.\n\nThe El Molo historically spoke the El Molo language as a native language. It belongs to the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.\n\nAccording to \"Ethnologue\", among other sources, the El Molo language is nearly extinct and there may already be no remaining speakers of the idiom. Most group members have now adopted the Nilo-Saharan languages of their neighbours.\n\nThe El Molo language has no known dialects. It is most similar to Daasanach.\n\nRecent advances in genetic analyses have helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis of the El Molo people. Genetic genealogy, although a novel tool that uses the genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern El Molo.\n\nAccording to an mtDNA study by Castri et al. (2008), the maternal ancestry of the contemporary El Molo consists of a mixture of Afro-Asiatic-associated lineages and Sub-Saharan haplogroups, reflecting substantial female gene flow from neighboring Sub-Saharan populations. A little over 30% of the El Molo belonged to the West Eurasian haplogroups I (23%) and HV1 (8%). Their frequencies of the rare I clade, which is believed to have originated in the Middle East, constitute a world high. The remaining El Molo samples carried various Sub-Saharan macro-haplogroup L sub-clades, mainly consisting of L3* (26%), L0a2 (17%) and L0f (17%).\n\nThe El Molo's autosomal DNA has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic affiliations of various populations in Africa. According to the researchers, the El Molo showed significant Afro-Asiatic affinities. They also shared some ties with neighboring Nilo-Saharan and Bantu speakers in eastern Africa due to considerable genetic exchanges with these communities over the past 5000 or so years.\n\nMany El Molo practice a traditional religion centered on the worship of Waaq/Wakh. In the related Oromo culture, \"Waaq\" denotes the single god of the early pre-Abrahamic, montheistic faith believed to have been adhered to by Cushitic groups.\n\nSome El Molo have also adopted Christianity.\n\n\n\n"}

Between 2010 and 2012, about 45,450 Filipinos were newly hired into Singapore.\n\nThe number of Singaporean citizens of Filipino origin is difficult to determine, since they are officially counted as members of the \"Others\" race by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority.\n\nAs of 2007, an estimated 80,000 work as domestic helpers, with another 12,000 in the information technology industry. This marks a slight rise from 1995, when roughly 75,000 domestic helpers from the Philippines were estimated to be working in Singapore. In recent years they have seen professional diversification, with others working as nurses, bank clerks, sales assistants in department stores, or entertainers. However, of those, only 27,000 were registered to vote in Filipino elections.\n\nThe number of Filipino victims of human trafficking jumped by 70% in 2007 to 212 cases.

The first widely reported incident was on June 23, 2017: ABP News reported a woman from Bikaner, Rajasthan, had her hair chopped by a 'witch' as she slept. Similar incidents were increasingly reported throughout India, particularly in the northern states of Delhi, Bihar, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Indian-administered Kashmir.\n\nOn June 23, 2017 ABP News reported a woman from Bikaner, Rajasthan had her hair chopped by a 'witch' as she slept. Additional hair-chopping incidents followed, and fears of an epidemicparticularly in Rajasthansoared. Incidents occurred not only at night but also during the day.\n\nThree days before the June 23 event, a similar incident was reported in Pipad City, Jodhpur, where a girl's hair had been found cut when she awoke in the morning. This news was first reported by Dainik Bhaskar. Along with the missing hair, the girl displayed injuries on other parts of her body. When police investigated, they found that the girl's hair had been cut by a blade. However, they were unable to find the culprit.\n\nOn July 6, 2017 the \"Hindustan Times\" reported that two girls from Rajasthan, aged 13 and 14 years old, and both unknown to each other, were victims of additional hair incidents.\n\nOn July 8, 2017 the BBC reported that many western municipalities including Bikaner, Nagaur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, and Jalore had been affected by these incidents.\n\nIn early August 2017, two cases were reported from Aligarh and Moradabad. Four cases were reported in Bulandshahr. But later Uttar Pradesh (UP) police and Delhi Police clarified that the incidents were only rumours. According to The Indian Express news channel, around thirty cases were filed all over north India.\n\nOn August 2, a 62-year-old woman was killed by angry villagers in Agra for being accused as a \"witch\" who cut the braids of girls. NDTV India reported this news on August 3, 2017. UP police filed murder cases on two suspects who fled the city and were neighbors of the victim.\n\nOn August 1, 2017 three women, unknown to each other and aged between 50 and 60, from Kangan Heri complained about being the victims of hair-chopping incidents on the same day. None of the women had seen their perpetrator, but when they fell unconscious and later woke up, they found their hair chopped.\n\nFifteen cases were reported in Haryana state. The women who were victims of these types of incidents said that they had witnessed \"god-men\", \"witches\" and \"cat-like creatures\". The police rejected these claims.\n\nOne such incident happened in Gurgaon on July 28, when a 60-year-old woman found her braid chopped when she awoke on the floor. She made claims that a thin man came to her doorsteps with a trident in his hand. She claims she asked him to leave, but he reappeared, which led her to fall unconscious. The police filed the case and entered it in the Daily Diary.\n\nIn this occupied region of India, there have been more than 200 incidents of women being attacked and often knocked unconscious by men in balaclavas, who then chop off their traditional hair braids. Officers had no solid leads or suspects, and Kashmiri police had to respond to a surge of revenge attacks by vigilantes armed with knives, cricket bats, and iron rods.\n\nThe initial police response to the braid attacks, which mainly occurred inside people's homes, was to suggest the victims were suffering from hallucinations. This drew criticism from the government-run Women's Commission, and they began serious investigations but no arrests have been made.\n\nTasleema Bilal, a 40-year-old woman whose hair was recently cut off while she was in her home in Srinagar, the region's main city, said that she tried to remove the attacker's mask before escaping, leaving her hair behind. Other women have said that they were knocked unconscious with a mysterious chemical spray that authorities have yet to identify.\n\nKashmiris have alleged the attacks are the \"handiwork of Indian agencies\" trying to intimidate the portion of Kashmir's population that opposes Indian rule. Residents are also suspicious of the Indian authorities, and some have accused soldiers and police of staging the attacks or protecting those responsible. In many incidents, the police and army appeared to aid the braid choppers in escaping by taking and saving them from public vigilantes.\n\nOn October 22, 2017, Arab News, a Saudi Arabian news agency, reported that around 100 women in Kashmir have been victims of hair-chopping incidents.\n\nIn the June 23 case, the victim's legs and hands had a \"Trishula\" mark, linking the incident to Hinduism. However, no Hindu religious leaders have responded to this detail.\n\nSome Indian Muslims have also been victims of these types of incidents. Some Islamic scholars stated that these incidents are being executed by mischievous elements in society.\n\nOn August 19, a report from Dainik Bhaskar changed the discussion surrounding these events. The report clearly proved that there was no such evidence of a witch or a ghost being responsible. In this report, a man from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh caught an insect which was later suspected to be a dermestidae, drugstore beetle, rain beetle or varied carpet beetle. This insect is believed to feed on keratin found in hair and nails.\n\nA similar case occurred on August 9, when a man killed a honey badger accused of eating or chopping women's hair, but due to lack of evidence, this report faced negligence.\n\nOn August 17, a report from Manpur, Madhya Pradesh had several eyewitnesses. The incident happened around 4 pm as the victim was sitting outside her house. She suddenly felt that her hair was being cut off. Her screaming brought the attention of her grandmother, who saw that her hair was being cut off, but she did not see anyone do it. Her grandmother quickly caught her fallen hair and the cutting stopped. Later the grandmother discovered an unusual detail. She noticed that as she picked up and held the hair, the rest of her granddaughter's hair was sheared, except for the exact number of hairs she held.\n\n"}
{"id": "15955870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15955870", "title": "Hugh Mason", "text": "Hugh Mason\n\nHugh Mason (30 January 1817 – 2 February 1886) was an English mill owner, social reformer and Liberal politician. He was born in Stalybridge and brought up in Stalybridge and Ashton-under-Lyne until he entered the family cotton business in 1838 after a seven-year period working in a bank. Having originally opposed trade unions, Mason became a paternalistic mill owner, creating a colony for his workers with associated facilities and ensuring that they experienced good conditions. During the Lancashire Cotton Famine of the 1860s he refused to cut workers' wages although it was common practice.\n\nMason became the first Liberal to be elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1856. He was mayor of the council from 1857 to 1860 and retired from local politics in 1874 due to conflict with his own party. Mason returned to the Liberals in 1878 when he stood for election as Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne. He was voted in and supported progressive policies, which included women's suffrage, making him unpopular within his own party. He was MP from 1880 to 1885. When he died in 1886, aged 69, Hugh Mason had amassed £290,933 (now about £17 million).\n\nHugh Mason was born in Stalybridge, Cheshire, on 11 May 1817 and christened there. He was the youngest of four children of Thomas Mason, a former textile manager, and Mary, the daughter of John Holden, Esq. The family had moved to Stalybridge from Derbyshire in 1776. After working as the manager of a mill in Ashton-under-Lyne, Thomas established his own business in 1815 in partnership with James Booth and Edward Hulton at Currier Slacks Mill in the town. Rapid growth in their enterprise saw them expand into the Bank Mill and Royal George Mills in the 1820s and Albion Mill in the 1830s. At the age of 10, Hugh was working in the mill, and his education consisted of attending Methodist Sunday schools in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge and spending three years at a private school in Ashton-under-Lyne.\n\nAfter leaving school at the age of 14, Mason got a job with the district bank while he attended night school in his spare time. He worked there until 1838, when he left at the age of 21 to join the family's cotton business. He became the driving force behind the business. The business thrived: by the early 1850s the Mason family had built two state-of-the-art cotton mills in the Ryecroft area of Ashton-under-Lyne, known as the Oxford Mills. He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.\n\nIn 1845, to house the workers for the mills, Mason began construction of a \"workers' colony\". The colony not only provided 150 terrace houses (housing an estimated 691 people in 1872) but also leisure facilities such as a library, a swimming pool, a gymnasium, and a reading room. Mason built up what he saw as a model industrial community, and according to Mason himself, the annual death rate was significantly lower than in the rest of Ashton-under-Lyne. Residents were expected to adhere to his strict moral code and he discouraged the use of public houses. He estimated that establishing the settlement cost him around £10,000 and a further £1,000 per year to maintain (about £600,000 today and a further £60,000 to maintain).\n\nUnder Hugh Mason's leadership, the company prospered. The number of mule spindles in use at the mills increased from 20,000 in 1846 to 75,000 in 1887. His two brothers, Henry and Booth, also worked in the company until retired in 1848 and 1853 respectively. Their father remained active in the company until 1860 when he retired, leaving Hugh as the sole owner. The \"Manchester Cotton Company\" was set up in 1860 and Mason's success in the cotton industry led him to become its chairman from the beginning until its winding up, which began in 1864, but was not concluded until 1867. The purpose of the company was to increase the number of producers of cotton; this was important as the American market was closed off during the American Civil War, causing the Lancashire Cotton Famine. Mason served as President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce from 1871 to 1874, and came to hold interests in the Bridgewater Canal Navigation Company, the Midland Railway Company, the Mersey Dock Board, and various other coal and iron companies.\nHaving initially opposed trade unions and factory legislation, Mason changed his mind around the 1850s regarding how workers should be treated, believing that the welfare of the employees impacted on the welfare of the employer. He became popular among workers for such things as becoming the first local employer to give his workers Saturday afternoons off. During the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865 he refused to cut workers' wages as was common during the period. He stated: \n\nAs well as this, he contributed £500 (about the equivalent of £30,000 today) to the Ashton borough cotton famine relief. During the tumultuous 1870s and 1880s, Mason kept his workforce fully employed and continued to invest in his mills. By 1884, wages in his mills were 25% higher than they had been in 1870 even though his employees were working fewer hours. The \"Manchester Guardian\" noted:\n\nHugh Mason was influenced by his father's Liberal politics and strongly opposed to injustice and prejudice. Thomas Mason was a supporter of political representation for Ashton-under-Lyne and supported the repeal of the Corn Laws. In the early 19th century, the area was poorly represented in Parliament. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport – with a combined population of almost one million – were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire (or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport). By comparison, more than half of all MPs were elected by a total of just 154 voters. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform and eventually the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Hugh said of his father that \"To his life of honest industry, to his example of commercial probity, to his high Christian character, to his training, of me in my early years, to his wise consuls, I owe under God my position in society.\"\n\nAlthough he claimed he was reluctant to enter politics, Hugh Mason became the first Liberal elected councillor for Ashton-under-Lyne in November 1856. He represented the Portland Place ward from 1856 until his retirement from politics in 1874. Mason quickly made an impression and was elected mayor for three consecutive years between 1857 and 1860, which had never happened before. He supported progressive measures such as opening a public park, providing public libraries, and addressing unsanitary conditions in parts of Ashton-under-Lyne.\n\nMason's policies led him to come into constant clashes with the Conservative members of the council. He was not always popular within his own party either and he even financed his own newspaper, the \"Ashton-under-Lyne News\", to convey his views and provide competition for the pro-Liberal \"Ashton Reporter\". Conflict with the Liberals drove Mason into early retirement from local politics in 1874 at the age of 57.\n\nAs well as being a councillor, Mason was also elected a local magistrate for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1857. During his time in office he had to deal with the bread riots of 21–22 March 1863 (caused by the cotton famine) and the Murphy Riots in May 1868. The Murphy Riots were anti-Catholic demonstrations, fueled by Fenianism (an Irish nationalist organisation), across Lancashire led by William Murphy. He personally went to one mob during the Murphy Riots to read them the riot act face-to-face. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of the County Palatine of Lancaster on 21 June 1862.\nSuch was his significance in Manchester he was appointed President of the Chamber of Commerce for two years from 1871. At the same time he was a Governor of Owen's College in the city. Mason was appointed a member of the Board of the Mersey Docks and Harbour.\n\nMason, along with a group of other Advanced Liberals supporting John Morley, the gladstonian, was one of the founding members of the Reform Club in Manchester, a political club founded in 1867 for Liberals and their supporters. Despite retiring from local politics because of conflict with the Liberals, by 1878 he was back in favour and Liberal councillors were encouraging Mason to stand for parliamentary election. Although he was a popular candidate, he was initially reluctant to put himself forward. However, he stood for Parliament in the 1880 General Elections. His campaign in March and April 1880 involved vitriolic attacks on the local Conservative Party and on 3 April 1880 he was elected MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, beating his opponent, John Ross Coulthart, by 2,966 votes to 2,586.\n\nAs an MP he lived at 33 Onslow Square, Kensington, and was a member of the Reform Club. Mason supported many reformist bills and became a spokesman of the Women's Suffrage Association in 1881. He proposed motions for women's suffrage in 1881 and again in 1883 but was defeated on both occasions. He led the women's suffrage movement until 1883 when illness forced him to retreat from public life temporarily. His defeat in the 1885 General Elections was ascribed to his support of William Ewart Gladstone over the issue of Irish Home Rule and to his illness. He lost to the Conservative John Wentworth Addison by 3,152 votes to 3,104. Mason demanded a recount, but this increased the majority by one vote; he succumbed to illness and died before the result was announced.\n\nIn 1846 Hugh Mason married Sarah Buckley, the daughter of Abel Buckley, Esq, who was also the father of Abel Buckley Businessman and MP, another cotton mill owner who went on to be a millionaire businessman and landowner. They had one child, Arnold, who was born in 1851. Sarah died in 1852 at the age of 29. Mason next married Sarah's sister, Betsy, though it was illegal to marry one's sister-in-law in England at the time. To overcome this problem they married in Denmark on 7 June 1854. Their marriage was approved by special licence from the King of Denmark and was held at the Evangellic Reform Church, Altona in the Duchy of Holstein. They had four children: Bertha, born in 1855, Edith in 1857, Rupert in 1859 and Sydney in 1861. Betsy died after the birth of Sydney and Mason then married for a third time Annie, daughter of George Ashworth, Esq, of Rochdale in 1864.\n\nHugh Mason died three days after his 69th birthday on 2 February 1886 at his home, Groby Hall. At his death, he had amassed a fortune worth £290,933 (now worth about £17M). He was the first person to have a statue (now protected as a Grade II listed building) erected in his honour in Tameside; it was financed by public subscription immediately after Mason's death.\n\n"}

The Mexican census does not report racial-ethnicity but only the cultural-ethnicity of indigenous communities that preserve their indigenous languages, traditions, beliefs and cultures.\n\nThe category of \"indigena\" (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak one of Mexico's 89 indigenous languages, this is the categorization used by the National Mexican Institute of Statistics. It can also be defined broadly to include all persons who self identify as having an indigenous cultural background, whether or not they speak the language of the indigenous group they identify with. This means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as \"indigenous\" varies according to the definition applied; cultural activists have referred to the usage of the narrow definition of the term for census purposes as \"statistical genocide\".\n\nThe indigenous peoples in Mexico have the right of free determination under the second article of the constitution. According to this article the indigenous peoples are granted:\n\namong other rights. Also, the Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Languages recognizes 89 indigenous languages as \"national languages\", which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken. According to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI), approximately 5.4% of the population speaks an indigenous language - that is, approximately half of those identified as indigenous. The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the 1980s.\n\nThe prehispanic civilizations of what now is known as Mexico are usually divided in two regions: Mesoamerica, in reference to the cultural area where several complex civilizations developed before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century, and Aridoamerica (or simply \"The North\") in reference to the arid region north of the Tropic of Cancer where few civilizations developed and was mostly inhabited by nomadic or semi-nomadic groups. Despite the conditions however, it is argued that the Mogollon culture and Peoples successfully established population centers at Casas Grandes and Cuarenta Casas in a vast territory that encompassed northern Chihuahua state and parts of Arizona and New Mexico in the United States. \n\nMesoamerica was densely populated by diverse indigenous ethnic groups which, although sharing common cultural characteristics, spoke different languages and developed unique civilizations.\n\nOne of the most influential civilizations that developed in Mesoamerica was the Olmec civilization, sometimes referred to as the \"Mother Culture of Mesoamerica\". The later civilization in Teotihuacán reached its peak around 600 AD, when the city became the sixth largest city in the world, whose cultural and theological systems influenced the Toltec and Aztec civilizations in later centuries. Evidence has been found on the existence of multiracial communities or neighborhoods in Teotihuacan (and other large urban areas like Tenochtitlan).\n\nThe Maya civilization, though also influenced by other Mesoamerican civilizations, developed a vast cultural region in south-east Mexico and northern Central America, while the Zapotec and Mixtec culture dominated the valley of Oaxaca, and the Purépecha in western Mexico.\n\nThere is common academic agreement that significant systems of trading existed between the cultures of Mesoamerica, Aridoamerica and the American Southwest, and the architectural remains and artifacts share a commonality of knowledge attributed to this trade network. The routes stretched far into Mesoamerica and reached as far north to ancient communities that included such population centers in the United States such as at Snaketown, Chaco Canyon, and Ridge Ruin near Flagstaff (considered some of the finest artifacts ever located).\n\nBy the time of the arrival of the Spanish in central Mexico, many of the diverse ethnic civilizations (with the notable exception of the Tlaxcaltecs and the Purépecha Kingdom of Michoacán) were loosely joined under the Aztec Empire, the last Nahua civilization to flourish in Central Mexico. The capital of the empire, Tenochtitlan, became one of the largest urban centers in the world, with an estimated population of 350,000 inhabitants.\n\nDuring the conquest of the Aztec Empire, the Spanish conquistadors, vastly outnumbered by indigenous peoples, used the ethnic diversity of the country and exploited the discontentment of the subjugated groups, making important alliances with rivals of the Aztecs. While the alliances were decisive to the Europeans' victory, the indigenous peoples were soon subjugated by an equally impressive empire. However, as the Spanish consolidated their rule in what became the viceroyalty of New Spain, the crown recognized the indigenous nobility in Mesoamerica as nobles and kept the existing basic structure of indigenous city-states. Indigenous communities were incorporated as communities under Spanish rule and with the indigenous power structure largely intact.\n\nAs part of the Spanish incorporation of indigenous into the colonial system, the friars taught indigenous scribes to write their languages in Latin letters so that there are huge corpus of colonial-era documentation in the Nahuatl language, Mixtec, Zapotec, and Yucatec Maya as well as others. Such a written tradition likely took hold because there was an existing tradition of pictorial writing found in many indigenous codices. Scholars have utilized the colonial-era alphabetic documentation in what is currently called the New Philology to illuminate the colonial experience of Mesoamerican peoples from their own viewpoints.\n\nSince Mesoamerican peoples had an existing requirement of labor duty and tribute in the pre-conquest era, Spaniards who were awarded the labor and tribute of particular communities in encomienda could benefit financially. Indigenous officials in their communities were involved in maintaining this system. There was a precipitous decline in indigenous populations due to the spread of European diseases previously unknown in the New World. Pandemics wrought havoc, but indigenous communities recovered with fewer members.\n\nWith contact between Europeans, the black slaves that they brought, and indigenous populations, there was intermingling of the groups, with mixed-race castas, particularly mestizos, becoming a component of Spanish cities and to a lesser extent indigenous communities. The Spanish legal structure formally separated what they called the \"república de indios\" (the republic of Indians) from the \"república de españoles\" (republic of Spaniards), the latter of which encompassed all those in the Hispanic sphere: Europeans, Africans, and mixed-race castas. Although in many ways indigenous peoples were marginalized in the colonial system, the paternalistic structure of colonial rule supported the continued existence and structure of indigenous communities. The Spanish crown recognized the existing ruling group, gave protection to the land holdings of indigenous communities, and communities' and individuals had access to the Spanish legal system. In practice in central Mexico this meant that until the nineteenth-century liberal reform that eliminated the corporate status of indigenous communities, indigenous communities had a protected status.\n\nAlthough the crown recognized the political structures and the ruling elites in the civil sphere, in the religious sphere indigenous men were banned from the Christian priesthood, following an early Franciscan experiment that included fray Bernardino de Sahagún at the Colegio de Santa Cruz Tlatelolco to train such a group. Mendicants of the Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustinian orders initially evangelized indigenous in their own communities in what is often called the \"spiritual conquest\". Later on the northern frontiers where nomadic indigenous groups had no fixed settlements, the Spanish created missions and settled indigenous populations in these complexes. The Jesuits were prominent in this enterprise until their expulsion from Spanish America in 1767. Catholicism with particular local aspects was the only permissible religion in the colonial era.\n\nThe insurgency against the Spanish Empire was a decade-long struggle ending in 1821, in which indigenous peoples participated for their own motivations. When New Spain became independent, the new country was named after its capital city, Mexico City. The new flag of the country had at its center a symbol of the Aztecs, an eagle perched on a nopal cactus. Mexico declared the abolition of black slavery in 1829 and the equality of all citizens under the law. Indigenous communities continued to have rights as corporations to maintain land holdings until the liberal Reforma. Some indigenous individuals integrated into the Mexican society, like Benito Juárez of Zapotec ethnicity, the first indigenous president of a country in the New World. As a political liberal, however, Juárez supported the removal of protections of indigenous community corporate land holding. \n\nIn the arid North of Mexico, indigenous peoples, such as the Comanche and Apache, who had acquired the horse, were able to wage successful warfare against the Mexican state. The Comanche controlled considerable territory, called the Comancheria. The Yaqui also had a long tradition of resistance, with the late nineteenth-century leader Cajemé being prominent. The Mayo joined their Yaqui neighbors in rebellion after 1867.\n\nIn Yucatan, Mayas waged a protracted war against local Mexican control in the Caste War of Yucatán, which was most intensely fought in 1847, but lasted until 1901.\n\nTzotzil Maya women from San Juan Chamula, Chiapas.\nThe greatest change came about as a result of the Mexican Revolution, a violent social and cultural movement that defined 20th century Mexico. The Revolution produced a national sentiment that the indigenous peoples were the foundation of Mexican society. Several prominent artists promoted the \"Indigenous Sentiment\" (\"sentimiento indigenista\") of the country, including Frida Kahlo, and Diego Rivera. Throughout the twentieth century, the government established bilingual education in certain indigenous communities and published free bilingual textbooks. Some states of the federation appropriated an indigenous inheritance in order to reinforce their identity.\n\nIn spite of the official recognition of the indigenous peoples, the economic underdevelopment of the communities, accentuated by the crises of the 1980s and 1990s, has not allowed for the social and cultural development of most indigenous communities. Thousands of indigenous Mexicans have emigrated to urban centers in Mexico as well as in the United States. In Los Angeles, for example, the Mexican government has established electronic access to some of the consular services provided in Spanish as well as Zapotec and Mixe. Some of the Maya peoples of Chiapas have revolted, demanding better social and economic opportunities, requests voiced by the EZLN.\n\nThe Chiapas conflict of 1994 led to collaboration between the Mexican government and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, an indigenous political group. This large movement generated international media attention and united many indigenous groups. In 1996 the San Andrés Larráinzar Accords were negotiated between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government. The San Andres accords were the first time that indigenous rights were acknowledged by the Mexican government.\n\nThe government has made certain legislative changes to promote the development of the rural and indigenous communities and the preservation and promotion of their languages. The second article of the Constitution was modified to grant them the right of self-determination and requires state governments to promote and ensure the economic development of the indigenous communities as well as the preservation of their languages and traditions.\n\nThe Spanish crown had legal protections of indigenous as individuals as well as their communities, including establishing a separate General Indian Court. The mid-nineteenth century liberal reform removed those, so that there was equality of individuals before Mexican law. The creation of a national identity not linked to racial or ethnic identity was an aim of Mexican liberalism.\n\nIn the late twentieth century there has been a push for indigenous rights and a recognition of indigenous cultural identity. \nAccording to the constitutional reform of 2001, the following rights of indigenous peoples are recognized:\n\nDuring the early colonial era in central Mexico, Spaniards were more interested in having access to indigenous labor than in ownership of land. The institution of the encomienda, a crown grant of the labor of particular indigenous communities to individuals was a key element of the imposition of Spanish rule, with the land tenure of indigenous communities continuing largely in its preconquest form. The Spanish crown initially kept intact the indigenous sociopolitical system of local rulers and land tenure, with the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire eliminating the superstructure of rule, replacing it with Spanish. The crown had several concerns about the encomienda. First was that the holders of encomiendas, called \"encomenderos\" were becoming too powerful, essentially a seigneurial group that might challenge crown power (as shown in the conspiracy by conqueror Hernán Cortés's legitimate son and heir). Second was that the encomenderos were monopolizing indigenous labor to the exclusion of newly arriving Spaniards. And third, the crown was concerned about the damage to the indigenous vassals of the crown and their communities by the institution. Through the New Laws of 1542, the crown sought to phase out the encomienda and replace it with another crown mechanism of forced indigenous labor, known as the repartimiento. Indigenous labor was no longer monopolized by a small group of privileged encomienda holders, but rather labor was apportioned to a larger group of Spaniards. Natives performed low-paid or underpaid labor for a certain number of weeks or months on Spanish enterprises.\n\nThe land of indigenous peoples is used for material reasons as well as spiritual reasons. Religious, cultural, social, spiritual, and other events relating to their identity are also tied to the land. Indigenous people use collective property so that the aforementioned services that the land provides are available to the entire community and future generations. This was a stark contrast to the viewpoints of colonists that saw the land purely in an economic way where land could be transferred between individuals. Once the land of the indigenous people and therefore their livelihood was taken from them, they became dependent on those that had land and power. Additionally, the spiritual services that the land provided were no longer available and caused a deterioration of indigenous groups and cultures.\n\nThe Spanish legal system divided racial groups into two basic categories, the \"República de Españoles\", consisting of all non-indigenous but initially white Spaniards and black Africans, and the \"República de Indios\". As there was greater intermixture and resulting offspring, a more formal casta system came into place, with specific terms for different racial mixtures. This system gave more political and social power to Spaniards so that Indigenous people and blacks could be kept in lower positions. When the ethnic origins of the person were not known, phenotypic characteristics were relied upon to determine the status of the individual. Those that were in lower statuses had to pay more to the crown.\n\nWhen Mexico gained independence in 1821, the casta system was eliminated as a legal structure, but racial divides remained. \nWhite Mexican argued about what the solution was to the \"Indian Problem\", that is indigenous who continued to live in communities and were not integrated politically or socially as citizens of the new republic. The Mexican constitution of 1824 has several articles pertaining to indigenous peoples. The second article of the constitution of Mexico recognizes and enforces the right of indigenous peoples and communities to self-determination and therefore their autonomy to:\n\nV. Preserve and improve their habitat as well as preserve the integrity of their lands in accordance with this constitution.\nVI. Be entitled to the estate and land property modalities established by this constitution and its derived legislation, to all private property rights and communal property rights as well as to use and enjoy in a preferential way all the natural resources located at the places which the communities live in, except those defined as strategic areas according to the constitution. The communities shall be authorized to associate with each other in order to achieve such goals.\n\nUnder the Mexican government, some indigenous people had land rights under ejido and agrarian communities. Under ejidos, indigenous communities have usufruct rights of the land. Indigenous communities choose to do this when they do not have the legal evidence to claim the land. In 1992, shifts were made to the economic structure and ejidos could now be partitioned and sold. For this to happen, the PROCEDE program was established. The PROCEDE program surveyed, mapped, and verified the ejido lands. This privatization of land undermined the economic base of the indigenous communities much like the taking of their land during colonization.\n\nThe history of linguistic rights in Mexico began when Spanish first made contact with Indigenous Languages during the colonial period. During the early sixteenth century mestizaje, mixing of races of culture, led to mixing of languages as well.\nThe Spanish Crown proclaimed Spanish to be the language of the empire; however, indigenous languages were used during conversion of individuals to Catholicism. Because of this, indigenous languages were more widespread than Spanish from 1523-1581. During the late sixteenth century, the status of Spanish language increased.\n\nBy the seventeenth century, the elite minority were Spanish speakers.\nAfter independence in 1821 there was a shift to Spanish to legitimize the Mexican Spanish created by the Mexican criollos. Since then, indigenous tongues were discriminated against and seen as not modern. The nineteenth century brought with it programs to provide bilingual education at primary levels where they would eventually transition to Spanish only education. Linguistic uniformity was sought out to strengthen national identity; however, this left indigenous languages out of power structures.\n\nThe Chiapas conflict of 1994 led to collaboration between the Mexican government and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, an indigenous political group. In 1996 the San Andrés Larráinzar Accords were negotiated between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Mexican government. The San Andres accords were the first time that indigenous rights were acknowledged by the Mexican government. The San Andres Accords did not explicitly state language but language was involved in matters involving culture and education.\n\nIn 2001, the constitution of Mexico was changed to acknowledge indigenous peoples and grant them protection. The second article of the constitution of Mexico recognizes and enforces the right of indigenous peoples and communities to self-determination and therefore their autonomy to:\n\n\nIn 2003, the General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples explicitly stated the protection of individual and collective linguistic rights of indigenous peoples. The final section also sanctioned the creation of a National Institute for Indigenous Languages (INALI) whose purpose is to promote the growth of indigenous languages in Mexico.\n\nHowever, there has been a lack of enforcement of the law. For example, the General Law on Linguistic Rights of Indigenous People guarantees the right to a trial in the language of indigenous peoples with someone who understands their culture. According to the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico), Mexico has not abided by this law. Examples of this include Jacinta Francisca Marcial, an indigenous woman who was imprisoned for kidnapping in 2006. After three years and the assistance of Amnesty International she was released for lack of evidence.\n\nAdditionally, the General Law on Linguistics also guarantees bilingual and intercultural education. However, it is a common complaint that teachers do not know the indigenous language or do not prioritize teaching the indigenous language. In fact, some studies argue that formal education has decreased the prevalence of indigenous languages.\n\nSome parents do not teach their children their indigenous language and some children refuse to learn their indigenous language for fear that they will be discriminated against. Scholars argue that there needs to be a social change to elevate the status of indigenous languages in order for the law to be withheld so that indigenous languages are protected.\n\nIndigenous women are often taken advantage of because they are women, indigenous, and often poor. Indigenous culture has been used as a pretext for Mexican government to enact laws that deny human rights to women such as the right to own land. Additionally, violence against women has been regarded by the Mexican government as a cultural practice. The government has enforced impunity of the exploitation of indigenous women by its own government including by the military.\n\nThe EZLN accepted a Revolutionary Law for Women on March 8, 1993. The law is not fully enforced but shows solidarity between the indigenous movement and women. The Mexican government has increased militarization of indigenous areas which makes women more susceptible to harassment through military abuses.\n\nIndigenous women are forming many organizations to support each other, improve their position in society, and gain financial independence. Indigenous women use national and international legislation to support their claims that go against cultural norms such as domestic violence.\n\nReproductive justice is an important issue to indigenous communities because there is a lack of development in these areas and is less access to maternal care. Conditional cash transfer programs such as Oportunidades have been used to encourage indigenous women to seek formal health care.\n\nThe number of indigenous Mexicans is judged using the political criteria found in the 2nd article of the Mexican constitution. The Mexican census does not report racial-ethnicity but only the cultural-ethnicity of indigenous communities that preserve their indigenous languages, traditions, beliefs, and cultures.\n\nThe Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Languages recognizes 62 indigenous languages as \"national languages\" which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories where they are spoken. According to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI), approximately 6.7% of the population speaks an indigenous language. That is, less than half of those identified as indigenous. 6,695,228 people 5 years or older were tallied as indigenous-language speakers in the 2010 census, an increase of about 650,000 from the 2000 census. In 2000, 6,044,547 people 5 years or older spoke an indigenous language.\n\nIn previous censuses, information on the indigenous speaking population five years of age and older was obtained from the Mexican people. However, in the 2010 census, this approach was changed and the Government also began to collect data on people 3 years and older because from the age of 3, children are able to communicate verbally. With this new approach, it was determined that there were 6,913,362 people 3 years of age or more who spoke an indigenous language (218,000 children 3 and 4 four years of age fell into this category), accounting for 6.6% of the total population. The population of children aged 0 to 2 years in homes where the head of household or a spouse spoke an indigenous language was 678 954. The indigenous language speaking population has been increasing in absolute numbers for decades, but have nonetheless been falling in proportion to the national population.\n\nThe recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern-day Mexican territory, but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States in the nineteenth century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the 1980s.\n\nThe five states with the largest indigenous-language-speaking populations are:\n\nThese five states accounted for 61.1% of all indigenous language speakers in Mexico. Most indigenous Mexicans do not speak their own languages and speak only Spanish. This is reflected in these five states' populations. Although Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, Puebla, and Yucatán have 34.2%, 27.2%, 9.4%, 11.7%, and 30.3% of their populations speaking an indigenous language, these states' indigenous populations are 65.73%, 36.15%, 29.25%, 35.28%, 65.4% respectively.\n\nAccording to the National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples (CDI), there were 25,694,928 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2015, which constitutes 21.5% of the population of Mexico. This is a significant increase from the 2010 census, in which indigenous Mexicans accounted for 14.9% of the population, and numbered 15,700,000 Most indigenous communities have a degree of financial, political autonomy under the legislation of \"usos y costumbres\", which allows them to regulate internal issues under customary law.\n\nThe indigenous population of Mexico has in recent decades increased both in absolute numbers as-well as a percentage of the population. This is largely due to increased self-identification as indigenous, as-well as indigenous women having higher birth rates as compared to the Mexican average. Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in more rural areas, than the Mexican average, but many do reside in urban or suburban areas, particularly, in the central states of Mexico, Puebla, Tlaxcala, the Federal District and the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nAccording to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are: Yucatán, with 65.40%, Quintana Roo with 44.44% and Campeche with 44.54% of the population being indigenous, most of them Maya; Oaxaca with 65.73% of the population, the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples; Chiapas has 36.15%, the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya; Hidalgo with 36.21%, the majority being Otomi; Puebla with 35.28%, and Guerrero with 33.92%, mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potosí and Veracruz both home to a population of 19% indigenous people, mostly from the Totonac, Nahua and Teenek (Huastec) groups.\n\nThe majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central and southern states. According to the CDI, the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population as of 2015 are:\n\n\nIn 2011 a large scale mitochondrial sequencing in Mexican Americans revealed 85 to 90% of maternal mtDNA lineages are of Native American origin, with the remainder having European (5-7%) or African ancestry (3-5%). Thus the observed frequency of Native American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46%<ref name=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-293.pdf\">http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2148-11-293.pdf\n“For mtDNA variation, some studies have measured Native American, European and African contributions to Mexican and Mexican American populations, revealing 85 to 90% of mtDNA lineages are of Native American origin, with the remainder having European (5-7%) or African ancestry (3-5%). Thus the observed frequency of Native American mtDNA in Mexican/Mexican Americans is higher than was expected on the basis of autosomal estimates of Native American admixture for these populations i.e. ~ 30-46%. The difference is indicative of directional mating involving preferentially immigrant men and Native American women. This type of genetic asymmetry has been observed in other populations, including Brazilian individuals of African ancestry, as the analysis of sex specific and autosomal markers has revealed evidence for substantial European admixture that was mediated mostly through men. In our 384 completely sequenced Mexican American mitochondrial genomes, 12 (3.1%) are of African ancestry belonging to haplogroups L0a1a’3’, L2a1, L3b, L3d and U6a7; 52 (13.6%) belong to European haplogroups HV, JT, U1, U4, U5; and K and the majority (320, 83.3%) are of Native American ancestry.” </ref>\n\nGenerally, indigenous Mexicans live more poorly than non-indigenous Mexicans however, social development varies between states, different indigenous ethnicities and between rural and urban areas. In all states indigenous people have higher infant mortality, in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations.\n\nSome indigenous groups, particularly the Yucatec Maya in the Yucatán peninsula and some of the Nahua and Otomi peoples in central states have maintained higher levels of development while indigenous peoples in states such as the Guerrero or Michoacán are ranked drastically lower than the average Mexican citizen in these fields. Despite certain indigenous groups such as the Maya or Nahua retaining high levels of development, the general indigenous population lives at a lower level of development than the general population.\n\nLiteracy rates are much lower for the indigenous, particularly in the southwestern states of Guerrero and Oaxaca due lack of access to education and a lack of the educational literature available in indigenous languages. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12%. The Mexican government is obligated to provide education in indigenous languages, but many times fails to provide schooling in languages other than Spanish. As a result, many indigenous groups have resorted to creating their own small community educational institutions.\n\nThe indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. A major reason for this is that significant number of the indigenous practice economically under productive agriculture and receive no regular salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health care.\n\n¹\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27274891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27274891", "title": "Iran's Family Protection Law", "text": "Iran's Family Protection Law\n\nIn 1967, Iran adopted a set of progressive family laws, the Family Protection Act, which granted women family rights ; these were expanded in the Family Protection Law of 1975. The act was annulled in 1979 after the Islamic Revolution when Sharia law was re-introduced, but it stands out for having been ahead of their time, particularly in a Muslim-majority country.\n\nToday, parts of the acts have been reintroduced in Iran, while others are under consideration. For instance the 1967 bill set up Special Courts for family matter. They were dissolved after the revolution, but Special Civil Courts were re-established in 1979 to adjudicate over matter relating to family law, succession and \"awqaf\". Similarly, some legislative changes have moved family matters in a more progressive direction in the areas of minimum age of marriage, child custody and the grounds on which women can request divorce.\n\nIn 1906, the first constitution was promulgated in Iran. A series of laws were enacted in the following years, including in family law.\n\nIn the 1930s, There were twelve shi'ite laws of marriage, divorce, legitimacy, and custody of children that were incorporated in the civil code (Qānūn-e madanī). These twelve laws were enacted and revised in the 1930s. Marriages and divorces had to be registered in state registries following passage of the Marriage Act of 1931 (Article 1041).\n\nIn 1962, Iranian law regarded women as being in the same class as minors, criminals, and the insane: they could not vote nor stand for public office, were not allowed the guardianship of their own children, could not work nor marry without permission of their male “benefactors,” could be divorced at any moment (with or without their prior knowledge, through the utterance of a simple sentence by the husband), and could be faced with the presence of a second, third, or fourth wife in their home at any moment-with no legal, financial, or emotional recourse. They could not become guardians of their children even after the father’s death. They could not transfer their citizenship to their children; indeed their citizenship was in jeopardy if they married a non-Iranian. They inherited from a father’s estate only half of what their brothers received and from a husband’s estate only one-fourth when there were no children and one-eighth if there were children.\n\nIn 1967, two family protection bills were proposed. Majles representatives, including Mehrangiz Dowlatshahi, presented the bill which would later become law. Female Senator Manhouchehrian presented a more progressive bill which was signed by 15 senators. However, when some of the media presented an exaggerated take on the progressive bill, Manhouchehrian had to leave Tehran until the publicity died down, and possible threats to her safety subsided. As a consequence, the family law articles on polygamy and child custody were not addressed until 1975. Nonetheless the Family Protection Law abolished extrajudicial divorce, greatly limited polygyny, and established special Family Courts for dealing with matters relating to the new personal status legislation.\n\nThe conservative clergy were vehemently opposed to the Family Protection Act and its goals. The Act removed a whole set of juridical issues in family interaction from clerical jurisdiction and handed it to family courts to decide. The clergy therefore lost much power and authority.\n\nThe law curtailed men's unilateral prerogatives regarding divorce and polygamy. Husbands would have to apply to a court for a non-reconciliation certificate first, and then the court would negotiate between the two parties.\n\nThe Family Protection Act was abrogated right after the 1979 revolution. \n\nMarriage age reverted to 9 for girls. Restrictions on polygamy and temporary marriages were repealed. The mehrieh (marriage portion payable to the wife) was taxed above the level considered customary by the government. \nIn September 1979, a modified version of the Family Protection Law's divorce provisions were introduced and adopted on the 23rd of that month. It creating special civil courts that went into effect in November of that year. It allowed divorce only after a judge attempted to reconcile a marriage between both parties, then the court would schedule to hear the case and make a decision. If both mutually consent to divorce, then they go to an Office of Marriage and Divorce Registration and register their divorce before 2 witnesses.\n\nAlso, The minimum age of marriage was moved from 9 to the onset of puberty. Child custody, no longer an inalienable right of fathers, is now up to the decision of Special Civil Courts. A 1992 law amended regulations on divorce, extending a wife’s access to divorce granting women more grounds for requesting a divorce.\n\nThe family protection law of 1967 increased the minimum age of marriage to 15 for women and to 18 for men. The family protection law of 1975 then raised the minimum age of marriage to 18 for women and to 20 for men.\n\nThe right of divorce had initially belonged solely to the husband, but with the Family Protection Law, both men and women can ask the courts for divorce under specific circumstances.\n\nThere were seven circumstances in which either spouse could ask for divorce. One involves the refusal of the provision of \"tamkin\", the duty, in Islam, to submit to a spouse's will. Traditionally, this has been applied to women, but Islam states that it must be reciprocated by both parties.\n\nThe other circumstances include:\n\nThe courts determined whether it would be more beneficial for the child to live with the father or the mother.\n\nThe father was responsible for providing support unless he was deemed financially incapable of doing so in which case the mother would be held responsible. The father was responsible for managing the finances of the child. However, after the father’s death, or in case of his inability to carry out his duties, the courts could appoint either the mother or the paternal grandfather as the child’s guardian.\n\nPrior to the ratification of the 1975 Family Protection Law, a man could marry four wives and have a large number of temporary marriages. As a result of this law (1975), a man could marry a second wife only by permission of the courts (with a valid reason to obtain this permission) and after obtaining the express consent of his first wife. Concurrently, the wife was given the right to obtain a divorce from her husband in case he took a second wife.\n\n\n\n"}

Throughout the 20th century, there was extensive emigration to the centre and south of Togo and also to Ghana and Benin. According to the Lomé statistics office, Kabiye speakers made up over 23% of the Togolese population in 1999.\n\nKabiye is one of two national languages of Togo (along with Ewe). In the Togolese context, \"national language\" currently means that the language is promoted in national media and, in the formal education sector, as an optional exam subject in grades 9 and 10.\n\nThe missionary-linguist Jacques Delord published the first descriptive grammar of Kabiye in 1976. This was followed by Keziye Lébikaza's descriptive grammar in 1999, which remains the key reference work in Kabiye linguistics. There is also a Kabiye-French dictionary. Other topics that have been the focus of research include: Comparative linguistics, Discourse analysis, Language contact, Lexicology, Morphology Phonology, Sociolinguistics, Syntax, Tone orthography, Tonology, and the verb system.\n\nThe earliest known publications in Kabiye appeared in the 1930s. Altogether there have been about 200 publications in Kabiye, though not all of these are still in print or easily available for purchase. For an inventory up to the turn of the century see Pouwili, 1999. Publications include two books of proverbs, folktales, poetry medical booklets, agricultural booklets, translations of the Bible, political tracts, religious tracts, a short novel, primers, and other pedagogical materials.\n\nThe Kabiye Wikipedia was initiated in June 2014 by Gnasse Atinèdi, the secretary of the Académie Kabiye. It currently (July 2017) has 1185 articles on a wide range of international subjects.\n\nThe long back unrounded vowels only occur at morpheme boundaries.\n\nKabiye is a tonal language, meaning that pitch differences are used to distinguish one word from another. These contrasts may be lexical (e.g. \"ɖálʋ́\" \"elder brother\" ~ \"ɖálʋ̀\" \"intestinal worm\") or grammatical (e.g. \"ɛɛkɔŋ́\" \"he isn't coming\" ~ \"ɛɛ́kɔŋ\" \"(when) he comes\" ~ \"ɛ́ɛkɔ́ŋ\" \"if he doesn't come).\n\nThere are two tones, high (H) and low (L). Six tone contours are possible on mono- and disyllabic nouns (H, L, HL, LH, HLH, LHL) and three on the imperative form of the verb (H, L, HL).\n\nKabiye also has automatic downstep, where a H following a L is always pronounced on a lower pitch than the preceding H within the same phonological phrase. Numerous tonal processes occur once words are placed in context.\n\nThe contour HLH always surfaces as HꜜHH ~ HHꜜH (depending on the consonant–vowel structure that it associates to). This is a postlexical process that occurs wherever the context permits, within words and across word boundaries.\n\nThere is lexical L tone spreading in the verb phrase and the associative noun phrase.\n\nKabiye has vowel harmony, meaning that the quality of the vowel in an affix is determined by that of the root vowel. There are two kinds:\n\n\n\nA limited number of prefixes undergo both vowel harmony processes, e.g. the first person plural subject pronoun: \"pà-kpàzá-à\" \"they coughed\", \"pɛ̀-wɛ̀ɛ́tà-à\" \"they whispered\", \"pè-wèlìsàá\" \"they listened\", \"pɔ̀-cɔ́nà-à\" \"they looked\", \"pò-ɖòzà-á\" \"they dreamt\".\n\nKabiye was first written in the 1930s, but it was in the early 1980s that the \"Comité de Langue Nationale Kabiyè\" (now the \"Académie Kabiyè\"), an organ of the Togolese Ministry of Education, standardized the orthography. Kabiye is written in modified Roman script based on the character inventory of the African reference alphabet. An alternative orthography, devised and promoted by R.P. Adjola Raphaël, is widely used among Catholics. The following tables show the grapheme-phoneme correspondences in the Standard orthography.\n\nThe orthography contains a significant amount of overspecification, since the 5 voiced obstruent graphemes \"b\", \"g\", \"gb\", \"v\", \"j\" are superfluous from a strictly phonemic point of view.\n\nThe grapheme is reserved for loanwords.\n\nThe standard orthography of Kabiye does not generally mark tone. The single exception is the spelling of two subject pronouns that are tonal minimal pairs:\n\nThe hyphen is used in the standard orthography in order to distinguish homophones. It appear between the possessive pronoun and the noun in the associative noun phrase, and between the verb root and the object pronoun in the verb phrase, e.g.:\n\nKabiye is an SVO language. The possessive precedes the head noun. Adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, locatives and relative clauses follow the head noun.\n\nKabiye has ten noun classes. The first eight are grouped in pairs of singulars and plurals that are sometimes referred to as genders. Some limited cross-pairing occurs. Class 9 contains uncountables (leaves, dust, mosquitos...), while class 10 contains liquids (milk, blood, oil...). There are certain other semantic tendencies (e.g., humans in classes 1 and 2, tools in classes 3 and 4), but these are by no means systematic. The class of any noun is identifiable by its class suffix and by the agreement of other potential elements in the sentence with it, such as pronouns, demonstratives, interrogatives, adjectives, determiners and the numerals one to five. The following table gives an example of a noun–determiner construction from each class. In each case, the class suffix is separated from the root with a hyphen:\n\nThe verb phrase is composed of an obligatory root and TAM (tense–aspect–mood) suffix. The TAM suffix may indicate imperative (\"hàzɩ̀\" \"sweep!\"), aorist (\"ɛ́házɩ̀\" \"and he swept\"), perfective (\"ɛ̀hàzàá\" \"he swept\"), imperfective present (\"ɛ̀házɩ̀ɣ̀\" \"he is sweeping\"), imperfective past (\"ɛ̀hàzàɣ́\" \"he was sweeping\") or infinitive (\"hàzʋ́ʋ̀\" \"to sweep\").\n\nKabiye is unusual in also having two designated paradigms for expressing comparatives in a subordinate clause: an imperfective form (\"ɛ̀zɩ́ ɛ̀hàzʋ̀ʋ̀ʋ́ yɔ́\" \"as he sweeps\") and a perfective form (\"ɛ̀zɩ́ ɛ̀hàzʋ́ʋ̀ yɔ́\" \"as he swept\").\n\nThe perfective has two forms: unbound (not followed by a complement: \"ɛ̀hàzàá\" \"he swept\") and bound (followed by a complement: \"ɛ̀hàzá ɖèdè\" \"he swept yesterday\").\n\nThe verb phrase may also optionally include modal prefixes that add nuances of meaning: adversative (\"ɛ̀tɩ́ɩ̀hàzɩ̀ɣ́\" \"he swept in spite of it\"), habitual (\"ɛ̀tɩ́ɩ́házɩ̀ɣ̀\" \"he usually sweeps\"), expectative (\"ɛ̀tɩ́ɩ́házɩ́ɣ́\" \"he sweeps in the meantime\"), immediative (\"ɛ̀tɩ̀hàzàá\" \"he swept straightaway\"), pluperfect (\"ɛ̀ɛ̀hàzàá\" \"he had swept\"), future (\"ɛ̀ɛ́hàzɩ̀ɣ̀ lɛ́\" \"when he will sweep\") and negative (\"ɛ̀tàhàzɩ́\" \"he didn't sweep\"). Some of these modal prefixes may also appear in combination with each other so that, for example, negative + adversative indicates a negative categorical meaning (\"ɛ̀tàtɩ́ɩ̀hàzɩ́\" \"he didn't sweep at all\").\n\nThe verb phrase may optionally add a subject pronoun prefix (written joined to the root or the modal prefix as in the examples above) and/or an object pronoun suffix (written joined to the root with a hyphen: \"ɛ̀hàzá-kɛ́\" \"he swept it\").\n\nThere is one modal suffix. It is used in conjunction with a negative modal prefix to indicate a Provisional meaning. It is written joined to the verb root (ɛ̀tàhàzɩ̀tá \"he has not swept yet\").\n\nThe verb phrase can also be extended by means of the suffix \"-náʋ̀\" to indicate instrumentality, accompaniment, manner, simultaneity or conformity (\"ɛ̀hàzɩ́nàà\" \"he swept with\").\n\nAll verb roots can be nominalised as agentive (\"házɩ́yʋ́\" \"sweeper\") or as locatives (\"ɖɩ̀hàzɩ̀yɛ́\" \"the place where one sweeps\").\n\n\"Man-kabɩyɛ kʋnʋŋ, ŋɖewa pɩfɛyɩ naʋ.

{"id": "27711337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27711337", "title": "Karelian alphabet", "text": "Karelian alphabet\n\nThe Karelian language is spoken in Russia, mostly in the Karelian Republic and in a small region just north of Tver, though most residents there were expelled in 1939. Karelian has seen numerous proposed and adopted alphabets over the centuries, both Latin and Cyrillic. In 2007, the current standardized Karelian alphabet was introduced and is used to write all varieties of Karelian, with the exception of Tver Karelian.\n\nThe oldest known document in Karelian, or in any Finnic language, is the Birch bark letter no. 292, found in 1957 and believed to be either an invocation against lightning, or an oath. Until the 19th century it is believed that Karelian was only written down by individuals; it was not taught in schools.\n\nIn the 19th century a few books were published in Karelian using Cyrillic, the first known one was \"A Translation of some Prayers and a Shortened Catechism\" into North Karelian and Olonets (Aunus) dialects in 1804. Karelian literature in 19th century Russia remained limited to a few primers, songbooks and leaflets.\n\nThe letters used to transcribe Karelian sounds varied. For example, in the gospel of St. Matthew (Герранъ мія̈нъ. Шондю-руохтынанъ святой і᷍ованг̧ели матвѣйста, Карьяланъ кїӗлѣлля) in South Karelian Tver dialect, in 1820, they used vowels with breves, circumflexes, and г with a cedilla: \n\nIn the Карельско-Русскій Букварь (Karelian-Russian ABC-Book), 1887:\n\nAnother example: in the Русско-Корельскій Словарь (Russian-Karelian Dictionary), 1908, \n\nTver State University Finno-Ugricist Lyudmila Georgievna Gromova points out in one great difficulty in these early Karelian Cyrillic alphabets, was the inconsistency in rendering the sounds a, ä, ja, jä, ö, jö, y, and jy. For example, in the 1820 translation of Matthew, \"я\" might represent the sound ä, ja, or jä.\n\nIn 1921, the first all-Karelian congress under the Soviet regime debated between Finnish and Karelian should be the official language (next to Russian of course) of the new \"Karelian Labour Commune\", which two years later would become the Karelian ASSR. In the end they chose Finnish over Karelian.\n\nNonetheless, some publishing continued in Cyrillic. The research into Karelian folklore of Maria Mikhailovskaya Bezhetsky, a teacher from the Vozdvizhenskaya school district, was published in 1925. In August–December 1929, the newspaper \"Tverskaya Derevnya\" (Tver Village), printed in Cyrillic, became the first newspaper ever published in the Karelian language.\n\nIn 1930-31, a Karelian literary language using the Latin alphabet was standardized for the Tver Karelian community, south of the Karelian ASSR and north of Tver, with the following alphabet:\n\nNote the additional letters borrowed from Cyrillic: з (/dž/) and ь, as well as the unusual Latin ƶ and ȷ (j without dot).\n\nIn 1937 the government wished to replace the use of Finnish (in the Karelian ASSR) and Karelian written in Latin (in the Tver Region), with a single standard Karelian language written in Cyrillic. Two proposals were sourced.\n\nHowever, in the end a proposal was adopted with fewer non-standard Cyrillic letters: it included the entire Russian alphabet plus the letters Ӓ, Ӧ, and Ӱ.\n\nOn September 8, 1937, at the proposal of its chairman, M.I. Kalinin, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee discussed the Cyrillization of the Karelian language. The final orthography was approved by the Karelian Regional Committee on February 10, 1938 and published in the newspaper \"Karel'skaya Pravda\". On February 14, the RSFSR People's Commissariat issued decree no. 214, introducing the single Karelian language in the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nFrom 1937-39 the Soviet government used the new Karelian standard language written in Cyrillic in both the Karelian SSR and Tver Region.\n\nDuring this period Sovetskoi Karelija was written in Karelian using Cyrillic, rather than in Finnish.\n\nThe effort was dropped in 1940 and Finnish (written as always in the Latin alphabet) once again became an official language of the Karelian SSR, while in the Tver region most Karelians were expelled in 1939 and Karelian was banned there. The reason for abandoning Cyrillic, and the Karelian language itself, as the national language of the republic may have two explanations:\n\n\nOlonets Karelian alphabet was approved in 1989 and it was used to write Olonets Karelian. It was replaced by the unified Karelian alphabet in 2007. The alphabet consisted of twenty-nine characters, and it was very similar to the modern alphabet:\n\nIn the Olonets Karelian alphabet, the letter Ǯ was used instead of the digraph \"Dž\" to mark the voiced affricate. For example, the word \"mandžoi\" (strawberry) was written \"manǯoi\". For the computers used in those days, the letter ǯ was problematic, and in many cases it had to be inserted manually afterwards. The letter Ü represented the same vowel sound as the letter Y used in the modern alphabet.\n\nThe modern unified Karelian alphabet is a used to write all variants of the Karelian language except Tver Karelian. It consists of a total of twenty-eight characters: twenty-two are from the ISO basic Latin alphabet, five are derived from basic Latin letters by the addition of diacritical marks, and the final character is the apostrophe, which signifies palatalization of the preceding sound. The entire range of sounds of native Karelian words is intended to be represented by this set of characters.\n\nThis unified alphabet was approved in 2007 as a replacement for the separate Olonets Karelian and Karelian Proper alphabets. The letters Ä and Ö are vowels which, unlike the German umlauts, are considered to be distinct and are alphabetized separately from the corresponding vowels without the umlauts. The postalveolar consonants Č, Š and Ž can be replaced by the digraphs \"Ch\", \"Sh\" and \"Zh\" when writing the caron is impossible or inconvenient—for example \"ruočči\" (Swedish) may be written as \"ruochchi\".\n\nOn May 29, 2014, the letter C was added to the unified alphabet. The letter may be used in Ludic Karelian native words and is allowed for use in loanwords in Livvi Karelian and in Karelian proper.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The coarse filament stripped from the fronds of the raffia palm tree served as the foundation of the Kongo weaving arts. This material imposed constraints that were overcome to produce varied and ingenious textile formats and structures.\n\nThe \"mpu\" was a supple knotted cap of golden raffia or pineapple fiber and a vital component of the chief's regalia, which also included a \"kinzembe\" mesh tunic, a woven chest bag, a charm bag (\"nkisi\"), a reliquary basket, the double bell, and a stool.\n\nFor Kongo, Vili, Yombe, Mbundu, and related peoples in northern Angola and the region formerly known as the Lower Congo, the \"mpu\" signified the authority invested in a person elected to an office of sacred leadership. Moraga writes that \"it was also a potent cosmological symbol connecting the chief (\"mfumu\"), the kin group, and the village to a mythic place of origin as well as a specific territorial domain (\"nsi\").\"\n\nThere are several types of \"mpu\" hats. The \"ngunda\" (from the root \"ngu\", meaning mother) is an unstructured domed style decorated with high-relief patterns that was bestowed on new chiefs during investiture rites. The \"ngola\" is a taller, conical cap worn by the paramount leaders of the Kongo realm.\n\nNearly all caps are constructed in spiral form, working from the center of the crown to the edge of the hat border. Mpu were designed to cover the spiritually vulnerable top of the head. The Congolese used to the term \"nzita\" to express their belief that hair grew in a circular pattern in this spot. According to Moraga, \"The crows of caps are typically worked with a spiraling lattice or openwork pattern that differs from the interlacing geometric designs on the sides- as if to mimic the whorls of the hair while accentuating the extraordinary protection afforded by the headwear.\"\n\nThe \"Kinzemba\" is an openwork tunic made of raffia fiber. The \"Kinzembe\" is unique among Central African ceremonial garments for having a traceable chronology that spans several hundred years and for the fact that it can be linked with a specific historical figure. Ne Vunde was a Kongo ambassador to the Vatican who died in 1608, shortly after arriving in Rome. He is represented wearing a \"Kinzembe\" in a memorial bust commissioned by the Pope after Ne Vunde's death. In 1688 in Angola, Capuchin priest Girolamo Merolla recorded the following description of a \"Kinzembe\": \"The gentry have a kind of straw garment on their sholders, which reaches down to their wastes, curiously wrought, wit their arms coming out at two slits, and ends in two tassels which hang down on the right side. About their wastes they have a cloth girth, which on one side hangs down to the ground.\"\n\nKongo baskets were displays of prestige and wealth. They were given as gifts to notables and foreigners as well as used by the wealthy and elite. These baskets often held prestige goods of great status that were given to the king. Special baskets also featured prominently in the ritual practice and belief of Kongo peoples.\n\nKongo baskets were fabricated with twill-patterned raffia fiber sides over a solid inner structure of wood or bark. The baskets' dynamic configurations of zig zags, diamonds, and chevrons arise naturally from a twill or plaiting technique using died or natural raffia fibers. They evolved into culturally significant patterns, which were translated into other media, such as funerary terracottas.\n\nAlthough separated by time and geography, there are many parallels between the Kongo and Kuba textile traditions. Both Kongo and Kuba art flourished within a hierarchical, courtly structure, and each society accorded high value to the arts of ceremony, personal adornment, and display. They also had in common the use of raffia palm fiber as the foundation of their weaving arts. Kongo and Kuba also share many geometric motifs, sacred signs, symbolic insignia, and types of textiles and prestige regalia, as well as techniques of fabrication.\n"}
{"id": "2653158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2653158", "title": "Kuso", "text": "Kuso\n\nKuso is the term used in East Asia for the internet culture that generally includes all types of camp and parody. In Japanese, means \"crap\" or \"shit\" and \"bullshit\", and is often uttered as an interjection. It is also used to describe outrageous matters and objects of poor quality. This definition of kuso was brought into Taiwan around 2000 by young people who frequently visited Japanese websites and quickly became an internet phenomenon, spreading to Taiwan and Hong Kong and subsequently to the rest of China. \n\nIn Chinese kuso is called \"e'gao\" (S: 恶搞, T: 惡搞, P: \"ègǎo\"), with the first character meaning \"evil\" or \"gross\" and the second meaning \"to make fun of [someone/something].\" In 2007 the word was so new that it was not listed in Chinese dictionaries.\nAccording to Christopher Rea, \"E’gao, the main buzzword associated with online Chinese parody, literally means “evil doings” or “malicious manipulation”\"; he notes that e'gao's \"semantic associations [to kuso] can be misleading, however, since e’gao is not fundamentally scatological—or even, as the Chinese term might suggest, malicious. In its broad usage, it may be applied to parody of any stripe, from fan tribute-mimicry to withering mockery. In a more restricted sense, it refers the practice of digitally manipulating mass culture products to comic effect and circulating them via the internet. The term e’gao may thus be interpreted in multiple senses, as it denotes variously a genre, a mode, a practice, an ethos and a culture.\"\n\nThe root of Taiwanese \"kuso\" was \"kuso-ge\" from Japan. The word \"kusoge\" is a clipped compound of \"kuso\" and \"gēmu\" (ゲーム, game), which means, quite literally, \"crappy (video) games.\" The introduction of such a category originally was to teach gamers how to appreciate and enjoy a game of poor quality—such as appreciating the games' outrageous flaws instead of becoming frustrated by them. This philosophy soon spread to Taiwan, where people would share the games and often satirical comments on BBSes. Games generally branded as kuso in Taiwan include \"Hong Kong 97\" and the \"Death Crimson\" series.\n\nBecause \"kuso-ge\"s were often unintentionally funny, soon the definition of kuso in Taiwan shifted to \"anything hilarious,\" and people started to brand anything outrageous and funny as kuso. Parodies, such as the Chinese robot Xianxingzhe ridiculed by a Japanese website, were marked as kuso. Mo lei tau films by Stephen Chow are often said to be kuso as well. The Cultural Revolution is often a subject of parody too, with songs such as \"I Love Beijing Tiananmen\" spread around the internet for laughs.\n\nSome, however, limit the definition of kuso to \"humour limited to those about Hong Kong comics or Japanese anime, manga, and games.\" Kuso by such definitions are primarily doujin or fanfiction. Fictional crossovers are common media for kuso, such as redrawing certain bishōjo anime in the style of \"Fist of the North Star\", or blending elements of two different items together. (For example, in \"Densha de D\", both \"Initial D\" and \"Densha de Go!\" are parodied, as Takumi races trains and drifts his railcar across multiple railway tracks.)\n\nIn China, earlier \"e gao\" works consisted of images edited in Adobe Photoshop. An example of this would be the Little Fatty internet meme.\n\n\n\n"}

His Jewish parents had immigrated from Libau, Latvia in 1900. His father, a cobbler, died shortly after the birth of Barney, the only child born in the States. His mother Bertha Hirschfield was a seamstress. Leon attended Trenton High School and graduated from New York University Law School in 1919.\n\nJosephson and his brother Louis became lawyers. In 1921, Josephson was admitted to the New Jersey state bar. In 1923, he traveled to the Soviet Union. In 1927, he went to Berlin. He practiced law in Trenton from 1926 to 1934.\n\nIn 1926, Josephson joined the Communist Party (then the Workers Party of America).\n\nIn 1929, Josephson was a lawyer for International Labor Defense (ILD). In 1929, he served on the defense team (along with Arthur Garfield Hays of the Sacco and Vanzetti case and Dr. John Randolph Neal of the Scopes Trial) for strikers in Loray Mill strike in Gastonia, North Carolina. He traveled to Europe for ILD in 1929, 1930, and 1931. In 1932, he traveled to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1932, Josephson was an employee of the Soviet trading agency Amtorg.\n\nAt some point, Josephson joined the Soviet underground. One of his codenames or covers was \"Bernard A. Hirschfield.\"\n\nIn 1932, Josephson was \"involved in providing support for the Russian illegal (either Comintern or Military Intelligence) \"LYND\", then visiting India.\"\n\nOn August 31, 1934 (according to a 1947 HUAC report–see below), Josephson signed his name \"Bernard A. Hirschfield,\" witnessed by Harry Kwiet (with whom he had associated in 1929 during the Gastonia trial), on a passport application for one \"Samuel Liptzen\" with a photo of Gerhart Eisler (identified in 1946 by former Communist and \"Daily Worker\" editor Louis F. Budenz as a \"mastermind\" Soviet spy).\n\nBy 1935, Josephson was reporting to Alexander Ulanovsky, recently \"rezident\" or Soviet station chief in New York and whose network members included Whittaker Chambers). Ulanovsky had resurfaced in Copenhagen to head Soviet espionage ring that collected military information on Nazi Germany. The Danish police arrested Ulanovsky and two Americans, Leon Josephson and George Mink, following a search of their hotel room which turned up codes, money, and multiple passports. The motive for the search was a charge of rape against Mink by a chambermaid. Ulanovsky claimed they were Jewish anti-fascists acting on their own, but the police produced information, possibly obtained from the Gestapo, that proved they were working for Soviet intelligence. The Danes held a secret trial and convicted Ulanovsky of spying and sentenced him to eighteen months in prison. He was later deported to the Soviet Union. Josephson returned to America. Mink had four fake passports on him. Danish investigators got help from American counterparts, who learned that Mink's passport for \"Harry Kaplan\" had been stolen by Leon Josephson's brother, Barney Josephson. Joseph spent four months in jail, awaiting trial. A Danish court found the evidence insufficient, and Josephson returned to the States. Later, State Department handwriting experts determined that the signature for another of the four passports (\"Al Gottlieb\") was Josephson's. A third American with them was \"Nicholas Sherman,\" really Robert Gordon Switz (previously arrested in Paris in 1933 in what Chambers later called the \"Switz Affair\").\n\nAround 1938, Josephson helped steal the papers of communist defector Jay Lovestone, according to Lovestone himself during testimony to the Dies Committee.\n\nIn December 1938, Leon borrowed $6,000 so his brother Barney could open Café Society in a basement room on Sheridan Square, West Village, New York City. Billie Holiday sang in Café Society's opening show in 1938 and performed there for the next nine months. Josephson set down certain rules around the performance of Strange Fruit at the club: it would close Holiday's set; the waiters would stop serving just before it; the room would be in darkness except for a spotlight on Holiday's face; and there would be no encore.\n\nBarney Josephson later said:\n\nI wanted a club where blacks and whites worked together behind the footlights and sat together out front ... There wasn't, so far as I know, a place like it in New York or in the whole country.\n\nFew nightclubs permitted blacks and whites to mix in the audience. Even the famous Cotton Club in Harlem was segregated, admitting only occasional black celebrities to sit at obscure tables and limiting black customers to the back of the room behind the pillars and partitions. Clubs south of Harlem, like the Kit Kat Club, did not let African-Americans in at all. Segregation in the States was relentless: as Josephson told Reuters in 1984, \"The only way they'd let Duke Ellington's mother in was if she was playing in the band.\"\n\nLeon Josephson represented Socialist clients of the Café Society.\n\nOn February 2, 1947, Josephson failed to appear under subpoena. He would have appeared with Gerhart Eisler, Ruth Fischer (Eisler's sister), Wiliam Nowell, Louis F. Budenz, and others. On that date, HUAC produced evidence that Josephson had forged his name as \"Bernard A. Hirshfield\" for a \"Samuel Liptzen\" on a passport application dated August 31, 1934, which bore a photo of Gerhart Eisler. On February 5, Josephson sent a telegram to HUAC chairman U.S. Rep. J. Parnell Thomas that advised, \"Unable appear before your committee February 6th, due inadequate notice of less than 48 hours. Counsel advises me such short notice unreasonable and that\nI am entitled to reasonable notice. Willing appear at later date fixed by you if reasonable notice given me.\"\n\nOn February 18, 1947, freshman U.S. Representative Richard M. Nixon mentioned Josephson's name often in his maiden speech to Congress:\n\nMr. Speaker, on February 6, when the Committee on Un-American Activities opened its session at 10 o'clock, it had by previous investigation, tied together the loose end of one chapter of a foreign-directed conspiracy whose aim and purpose was to undermine and destroy the government of the United States. The principal character of this conspiracy was Gerbert Eisler, alias Berger, alias Brown, alias Gerhart, alias Edwards, alias Liptzin, alias Eisman, a seasoned agent of the Communist International ... <br><br>Two other conspirators and comrades of Eisler, Leon Josephson and Samuel Liptzin, who were subpenaed to appear, did not appear; Josephson contended by telegram that two days was not sufficient notice for him to come from New York to Washington ... It is no wonder that Eisler refused to talk and Josephson and Liptzin did not respond to the subpenaes ... <br><br> I think I am safe I announcing to the House that the committee will deal with Mr. Josephson and Mr. Liptzin at a very early date ... Now the handwriting on this application, according to the questioned documents experts of the Treasury Department, is that of Leo Josephson; the name on this application is that of Samuel Liptzin the picture on this application is that of Gerhart Eisler; the signature of the identifying witness, Bernard A. Hirschfield, is also in the handwriting of Leon Josephson ...\n\nOn March 5, 1947, several witnesses appeared before HUAC. First came the real Samuel Liptzen, accompanied by labor lawyer Edward Kuntz as counsel: both were sworn in. Liptzen was born on March 13, 1893, in Lipsk, Russia (now Liepinė, Lithuania). In April 1909. he emigrated to the United States. On March 13, 1917, he became an American citizen. In 1920 or 1921, Liptzen joined the Party member. He had been a tailor and a member of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. Then he worked in the fur industry until he became sick from dye. Between 1926 and 1928, he traveled twice to Canada (and again in the summer of 1945). In 1928 or 1929, he ran for the New York City Assembly. In 1935, he lived in Los Angeles (while ill). For two or three years, he had worked in the offices of the \"Morning Freiheit\" (\"Morgen Freiheit\", a Yiddish language newspaper affiliated with the Communist Party USA and with offices in the same building as the \"Daily Worker\", founded by Moissaye Olgin in 1922). (Liptzen called it a \"left-wing\" and \"progressive\" newspaper.) He claimed he had been unable to appear on February 6, 1947, as required by subpoena because of the illness of \"the missus with whom I have the rooms,\" named Mrs. Annie Halland (Holland). He also stated that he had never applied for a passport – despite a passport application in his name dated August 31, 1934. Liptzen swore on the spot, \"It isn't my signature ... absolutely not,\" nor his photo, nor a photo of anyone he knew. Liptzen could not produce his naturalization papers, nor when he lost them due to robbery, nor exactly where he lived when his home was robbed. Liptzen also denied ever \"loaning\" anyone his naturalization papers or knowing Josephson or Eisler (including any of his aliases or codenames).\n\nAttorney Edward Kuntz was representing both Liptzen and the \"Morning Freiheit\"; until a few years before, he had already represented the \"Daily Worker\". Kuntz described building occupants at 35 East 12th Street in New York City: CPUSA national committee on top ninth floor, \"Daily Worker\" editorial offices on eighth, F. & D. Printing Co. on seventh, \"Morning Freiheit\" sixth, CPUSA state on fifth, \"Daily Worker\" business offices on second, and F. & D. Printing Co. presses in the basement. Kuntz explained that he had changed the legal status of the \"Freiheit\" from business to membership corporation and that there were some communists who were corporate members and contributing journalists.\n\nNixon resumed questioning of Liptzen thereafter, asking him how he had managed not to see Eisler in that building; Liptzen simply denied knowing him or having seen him. HUAC member U.S. Rep. Bonner resumed questioning of Kuntz to ask him more about the \"Freiheit\" and the owners of the building and corporation therein. Kuntz could tell him little other than the current head of the \"Freiheit\": \"Lechovitzky.\" HUAC member U.S. Rep. Vail resume questioning of Liptzen regarding his alleged telegram to decline appearance. Liptzen confirmed that he wrote humorous pieces for the \"Freiheit\" and had written the book \"In Spite of Tears\". (Vail exclaimed, \"You arrived at the age of 17 and you still write in Jewish (Yiddish)?\" Vail and Stripling resumed questioning of Kuntz, who admitted that for some years up to the early 1940s he had headed the staff of International Labor Defense (which had a peak of 250–300 volunteer labor lawyers) and was chairman of the legal committee when ILD dissolved but denied knowing Josephson there. (In 1946 the ILD merged with the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties or NFCL and National Negro Congress or NNC to form the Civil Rights Congress or CRC).) When asked by Stripling whether he was sympathetic to communism, Kuntz answered, \"Most of it\" but denied being a communist. Kuntz, who denied knowing Eisler but admitted he knew Josephson because \"I used to be a habitue of Cafe Society.\" Their joint testimony ended with HUAC's informing Liptzen that he remained under subpoena and was \"not excused\" but rather subject to recall. (Stripling managed to work in mention that U.S. Rep. Vito Marcantonio was ILD president.)\n\nThat day, Josephson also appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He refused to be sworn in due to the \"unconstitutionality of this committee\" and refused to answer questions. Samuel A. Newburger of New York City served as his legal counsel.\n\nThe hearing's transcript records:\nThe Chairman: Mr. Josephson, will you stand and be sworn?\n\nMr. Josephson: I will not be sworn.\n\nMr.Stripling: Will you stand?\n\nMr. Josephson: I will stand.\n\nMr. Stripling: Do you refuse to be sworn?\n\nMr. Josephson: I refuse to be sworn.\n\nMr. Stripling: You refuse to give testimony before this sub-committee?\n\nMr. Josephson: Until I have had an opportunity to determine through the courts the legality of this committee.\n\nThe Chairman: You refuse to be sworn, and you refuse to give testimony before this committee at this hearing today?\n\nMr. Josephson: Yes.\n\nThe appellant was then excused subject to call either by the sub-committee or the full committee.\n\nAs a result, Josephson was found guilty of contempt of Congress.\n\nOn March 21, 1947, HUAC held further hearings with witnesses about Eisler and Josephson.\n\nHUAC investigator (and former FBI agent) Louis J. Russell provided an overview of his life, from birth in Latvia, espionage in the States and Denmark with George Mink during the 1930s, and efforts to make the false application for Gerhart Eisler's passport in 1934. Russell noted that penniless brother Barney Josephson had made trips to Europe in the mid-1930s before opening Café Society in 1938. He also noted that in 1946 Barney was a sponsor of \"Spanish Refugee Appeal,\" a branch of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee (which had paid Eisler funds in 1941 under another false name). Russell then presented 1938 Dies Committee testimony from John P. Frey, former president of the metal trades department of the AFL that claimed that Mink had been involved in the Soviet assassination of Leon Trotsky and proceeded to insert four pages of transcripts into the record that included 1938 testimony by Earl Browder, Benjamin Gitlow, and Jay Lovestone among others, all about Mink. Russell documented Josephson's Party membership and loyalty to the Soviet Union with quotes from his own writings, e.g., \"The new Soviet constitution and electoral law are the most democratic in the world\" and his dream of a \"Soviet America.\" HUAC chief investigator Robert E. Stripling concluded \"Mr. Eisler and Mr. Josephson ... are in the higher echelons of the Communist International.\" Russell then showed Josephson's connection to two current Federal employees, Sol Rabkin and Milton Fischer, both of whom had affiliations with known \"communist fronts\" including the National Lawyers Guild (Rabkin). Stripling complained that Martin Popper had called as Josephson's lawyer to ask for extension on appearance in the subpoena, only to later deny he was representing Josephson. (Stripling noted that Popper was long-time executive secretary of the National Lawyers Guild.) Russell then proceeded to provide his report on the real Samual Liptzen. Liptzen had failed to report trips to Mexico and Canada to the FBI. He had failed to report the robbery of his naturalization papers for two years. Finally, Russell found an article in the \"Jewish Daily Forward\" (Yiddish \"Forverts\") dated March 8, 1947, that stated that Liptzen and Josephson are friends and that Liptzen had a long history in the Soviet underground, for which he was expelled from unions and wound up at the \"Freiheit\".\n\nAlwyn Cole, Treasury examiner, reported that his examination of handwriting on the 1934 passport application revealed that the handwriting of the signature \"Bernard A. Hirschfield\" belonged to Leon Josephson. Cole did not find the signature \"Samuel Liptzen\" as confidently belonging to Gerhart Eisler, though he was confident that the real Samuel Liptzen had not signed.\n\nFred Erwin Beal, indicted during the Loray Mill strike of 1929, testified next. Josephson (with Clarence Miller of the National Textile Workers Union and Juliet Stuart Poyntz of the International Labor Defense) had helped arrange false passports for many of those indicted, including himself, and helped them flee to the Soviet Union. Beal saw Josephson in Moscow several times and knew him to be a GPU agent. After some years, Beal returned to the States, although he faced possible re-arrest and imprisonment, rather than stay in the USSR. Josephson, William Z. Foster, and other high-level communists persuaded Beal to return to Moscow. He saw George Mink there several times. Again he left: in 1940, he was serving four years in the Raleigh Penitentiary, where the FBI visited him several times.\n\nColumnists like Dorothy Kilgallen, Lee Mortimer, Westbrook Pegler, and Walter Winchell attacked. Within weeks of these attacks, business at Café Society fell away, and his brother Barney had to sell.\n\nAccording to the 2007 book \"Spies\", Josephson and John L. Spivak \"burglarized\" the offices of labor lawyer O. John Rogge, attorney for David Greenglass, and stole papers later published by the Communist Party to discredit Greenglass in his testimony in the Rosenberg Case.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1956, Josephson taught Soviet Law at the Jefferson School of Social Science.\n\nJosephson married Lucy; they had two children.\n\nJosephson died in February 1966 of a \"massive heart attack.\"\n\nShortly after his HUAC testimony, Josephson publicly avowed membership in the Communist Party USA in the influential leftist journal, the \"New Masses\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13239747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13239747", "title": "Majang people", "text": "Majang people\n\nThe Majang people, or Majangir, live in southwestern Ethiopia and speak a Nilo-Saharan language of the Surmic cluster. The 1998 census gave the total of the Majangir population as 15,341, but since they live scattered in the hills in dispersed settlements (Stauder 1971), their actual total number is undoubtedly much higher. They live around cities of Tepi, Mett'i, and scattered southwest of Mizan Teferi and towards Gambela.\n\nThey traditionally lived in small groups, farming for 3 to 5 years, then moving on as the fertility of the soil diminished (Stauder 1971). They were active bee keepers, collecting honey from hives consisting of hollowed logs placed in trees. They did some hunting and snaring of game and trapping of fish. They raised the bulk of their own food by farming, animals providing only a small part of their diet. \n\nFood production has changed since Stauder's time. The single most obvious change is that people are now living in permanent settlements. Livestock was not traditionally raised, but many Majangir have begun small scale livestock raising since about 1980. In addition, they have begun planting fruit and coffee trees, plants that take a number of years to produce a crop. \n\nThe Majangir traditionally had a very egalitarian society, with no standing political leaders (Stauder 1971, 1972). The only people in official positions were people in the role of \"tapad\" (final implosive d), who served as ritual leaders. These were from the Meelanir clan, a group has links with similar-named privileged clans in other Surmic groups (Unseth and Abbink 1998). \n\nIn case of a serious disagreement, one party would simply move away. There was no standard social reconciliation mechanism as is found in highland Ethiopian cultures.\n\nThe Majangir have over 70 clans, with clan identity passed down through the male line. A person cannot marry a person from the same clan (exogamy), nor should they marry a person from their mother's clan (Stauder 1971, Unseth 1998a).\n\nThe Majangir traditionally made two kinds of alcoholic drink: one from grain \"tááján\" (cf. tella) and one from honey \"ògòòl\" (cf. tej; Teramoto et al., 2005).\n\nThe Majangir have traditionally used a number of musical instruments, sometimes to accompany singing and sometimes played without. Their instruments include a five-string lyre, thumb piano, drum, rattles, panflute. In addition, they play a vertically suspended marimba with as few as three wooden bars, but this is seen as a way of passing time, especially when guarding fields, rather than an instrument for music.\n\nTheir vocal music includes singing of both harmonies and antiphonal parts. Often, this results in two parts being sung by women and two parts by men. \n\nChanges are happening rapidly to their traditional way of life. Since about 1971, many Majangir have become Christians (Hoekstra 2003 and Sato 2002). Further, since the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 1991, with its subsequent remapping of Ethiopia by ethnic lines, the Majangir have felt very marginalized politically, their territory now divided among three \"kalil\" or administrative Regions (Sato 2000 and 2002). This frustration has led to some armed fighting with the government (Vaughan 2003:268).\n\nThe Majangir language is part of the Surmic cluster, however it is the most isolated language in that cluster (Harold C. Fleming 1983). A language survey has shown that dialect variation from north to south is minor and does not seriously impede communication\n\nThe language has implosive consonants (bilabial and retroflex), but no ejective consonants (Bender 1983). There are seven vowels, and length of duration of the vowel is also distinctive, such as \"goopan\" 'punishment' and \"gopan\" 'road'. In addition, two tones also distinguish meaning, on both the word level and the grammatical level: \"táŋ\" (higher tone) 'cow', \"tàŋ\" (lower tone) 'abscess'.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7851588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7851588", "title": "Mediation in Australia", "text": "Mediation in Australia\n\nMediation in the multi-cultural society of Australia, as a form of dispute resolution, may involve understanding the role that culture plays.\nCultural differences often exist due to race and ethnicity, but can also arise from religion, gender, age, sexual orientation and disabilities.\nMajor concerns in cross-cultural dispute-resolution include perceived power-imbalance — often escalated by communication-difficulties, misconceptions, negotiation-behaviour, face-saving and the publicity surrounding the dispute.\n\nNative title in Australia has frequently given rise to mediation. If a mediator lacks cultural literacy across different cultures or awareness of parties having difficulties during the mediation due to differences in culture, then the mediator’s lack of understanding or misunderstanding could cause a breakdown in the negotiation-process. Cultural awareness ensures that mediators can adapt their skills and techniques to ensure that they can maintain their standard of care throughout the mediation process.\nNative-title mediation differs from regular mediation in that, rather than the parties referring a dispute to mediation, the Federal Court of Australia can also determine whether the National Native Title Tribunal should mediate a matter. Other distinctive features occur: often native-title mediations can involve up to one hundred participants; lawyers play a minimal role; and rather than making technical legal points the speakers for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands people often talk about their family genealogies, traditions, dreaming and stories to support their claims. \n\nThe National Native Title Tribunal does not decide whether native title exists over land in question: rather it has the role of mediating contested applications and applications for compensation which originated in the Federal Court of Australia. More importantly, the parties must mandatorily attend a native-title mediation unless the court has granted leave.\nHowever, the parties can apply for the termination of the mediation at any time later than three months after the commencement of the mediation. \n\nDue to the large number of applicants in native-title applications, the process of mediation differs somewhat from that of other mediations. The National Native Title Tribunal takes a more \"outcome-focused\" approach.\nIn the course of a number of pre-mediation meetings the mediator obtains information from the parties in relation to the claim itself and tries to obtain information from the parties regarding their interests in the claim and any other matters which may have relevance to the mediation.\n\nMediation-clauses aim to ensure that if a conflict arises the parties will settle it amicably and fairly by triggering the requirement for the parties to use the mediation process (as opposed to the court system).\nAs more Australian companies realise the benefits of settling commercial disputes out-of-court, many companies include compulsory mediation-clauses in their contracts. Such benefits include avoiding negative publicity that can often entail following a trial, reduced legal fees and less time spent by management with lawyers. \n\nContracts which could include mediation-clauses include franchise-agreements, commercial contracts, building and construction agreements, finance and lease agreements and joint ventures. Standard mediation-clauses appear on the websites of professional associations and of mediation-agencies; however mediators may draft some clauses to suit specific circumstances, for example if the parties reside in different countries. \n\nStandard mediation-clauses generally provide — in the event of a dispute — for the referral of the matter to a mediator, and make it subject to the rules of mediation. Further, standard clauses will often specify an alternative if the parties fail to reach agreement within a specified time. Most importantly, such clauses allow for the continuation of the contract notwithstanding the current dispute. \n\nNote that the Australian courts, in times, have declared a number of mediation-clauses void due to poor drafting. The reasons the courts have cited for declaring the mediation clauses void include, for example:\n\n\nMediators may therefore obtain legal advice when drafting such clauses to ensure their enforceability.\n\nIn Australia, once parties have decided to participate in a mediation, the majority of mediators will require them to sign a document commonly known as an \"agreement to mediate\". Agreements to mediate represent an important step in the mediation-process because parties participating in mediation often have different views and expectations in relation to the mediation-process, the mediator’s role and the parties’ role.\n\n\"Agreements to mediate\" include clauses in relation to:\n\n\nImportantly, agreements to mediate provide both the mediator and the parties to the mediation with a contract which, if breached, will give rise to remedies for breach of contract. \n\nMany Australian government agencies, professional and industry-bodies and mediation-agencies provide \"pro-forma\" agreements to mediate on their web-sites. The mediator should ensure that the parties understand the terms of the agreement before executing it. Mediators should also give the parties an opportunity to ask questions and suggest changes.\nOnce the parties express themselves content with the agreement to mediate, the mediator should arrange for its signing and dating prior to the commencement of the mediation.\n"}
{"id": "51733745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51733745", "title": "Natasha Ryan", "text": "Natasha Ryan\n\nNatasha Anne Ryan (born 1984) is an Australian woman who went missing in 1998 as a young teenage girl from Rockhampton, Queensland. Police assumed she had been murdered by a local serial killer. Ryan was discovered alive in 2003 during the trial of the man accused of her murder, almost five years after she went missing.\n\nNatasha Ryan disappeared on 31 August 1998 after her mother dropped her off at school, and was subsequently reported as missing. An extensive and exhaustive search was undertaken by police and local State Emergency Service volunteers. Hopes of finding Ryan alive soon diminished and police concluded she had been murdered by Rockhampton serial killer Leonard Fraser, who was subsequently charged with Ryan's murder.\n\nIn the month before she went missing, Ryan had already run away from home once, aided by her boyfriend Scott Black. In that incident, she was found after just two days. Black faced Rockhampton Magistrates Court in November 1999, where he pleaded guilty to wilful obstruction of police after he had told officers that he didn't know Ryan's whereabouts.\n\nBut after she could not be located when she went missing the second time, Ryan's family eventually accepted that she was dead. Ryan's family held a memorial service in Bundaberg, Queensland on Ryan's 17th birthday in 2001.\n\nLeonard John Fraser, already serving a life sentence for the murder of 9-year-old Keyra Steinhardt in April 1999, confessed to five murders, including that of Natasha Ryan, in an apparent deal with police to avoid the general population in jail. After being charged with the murders of Natasha Ryan, Sylvia Benedetti, Beverly Leggo and the manslaughter of Julie Turner, Fraser stood trial in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Brisbane, Queensland. He has since died in prison.\n\nOn 11 April 2003, during Fraser's murder trial in Brisbane, police prosecutor Paul Rutledge announced that he was pleased to inform the court that Fraser was not guilty of the murder of Natasha Ryan. Ryan's father Robert said he almost collapsed when Rutledge made the announcement.\n\nPolice had raided a house in North Rockhampton on the night of 10 April 2003 and had found Natasha Ryan alive, and hiding in a cupboard. It was discovered that Ryan had been living with her boyfriend Scott Black since disappearing on 31 August 1998. It was reported that for most of that time, Ryan had shared a house in Yeppoon, Queensland, but had moved back to Rockhampton after Black received a transfer with his milk delivery job. Ryan had been living in the Rockhampton house for six months prior to being found.\n\nDespite becoming known as 'the girl in the cupboard' and the media leading people to believe that Ryan had spent most of her time in a cupboard, it was soon learned she only used a cupboard to hide if visitors called around to visit her boyfriend. The remainder of the time, Ryan freely walked around the house but always with the curtains drawn. It was also reported that she had ventured outside a number of times, but always under the cover of darkness, which included a midnight visit to the beach.\nDespite the discovery that Natasha Ryan was still alive and the doubt it cast on the evidence which led to Fraser being charged with Ryan's murder, Fraser's defence counsel did not lodge an appeal for a mistrial, and the trial forged ahead. Ryan attended what had essentially been her own murder trial on 30 April 2003 to answer questions. Ryan told the court she had never met Leonard Fraser and did not know the witness who stated that she had been seen in the presence of Fraser before she went missing.\n\nA jury eventually found Fraser guilty of the murders of Beverly Leggo and Sylvia Benedetti and guilty of the manslaughter of Julie Turner. Fraser was sentenced to three indefinite prison terms on 13 June 2003. He died from natural causes on 1 January 2007.\n\nThe story of Natasha Ryan being found alive during the murder trial attracted international attention.\n\nFollowing her re-appearance, controversial Australian publicist Max Markson was quick to sign Ryan up as a client, and negotiated potential deals with several media organisations. Markson eventually secured a media deal with Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, which was the parent company of ACP Magazines and the Nine Network. The deal guaranteed Ryan would do exclusive interviews with ACP's \"Woman's Day\" and \"60 Minutes\".\n\n\"60 Minutes\" sent reporter Tara Brown to Rockhampton to do the story with Ryan. Assuming Ryan's story was going to hand them a ratings-winning program, \"60 Minutes\" held Ryan's story until 20 April 2003 in an attempt to take viewers away from Network Ten's premiere of the third season of their ratings winner, \"Big Brother Australia\". The strategy failed to work and \"Big Brother Australia\" won the battle with an average capital city audience of 2.2 million viewers, compared to the 1.7 million viewers 60 Minutes managed to attract.\n\nThere were reports that PBL deal that Max Markson negotiated would bring in more than $200,000 for Natasha Ryan, prompting a discussion about the ethics of Ryan accepting the money when so much time, effort and money was spent on the search for her, and the police investigation. Rockhampton SES volunteer Lyle Dobbs expressed his view that any profit Ryan gained from her interviews should go back to Queensland taxpayers who funded the search which came at significant cost to police and a lot of effort from SES volunteers.\n\nThe PBL contract was eventually produced in court proceedings in 2006, which finally confirmed the figure of what PBL paid for the interviews at $120,000.\n\nNatasha Ryan and Scott Black were married in 2008. It's believed that prior to their wedding, they signed another media deal with \"Woman's Day\" for exclusivity to the stories that were published before and after their wedding.\n\nDuring the wedding at Byfield, Queensland, there was strict security, with guests screened and strictly forbidden from taking any photos during the ceremony and reception. It was reported the wedding story deal with \"Woman's Day\" was worth $200,000.\n\nSoon after being discovered alive, it became apparent that Ryan and her boyfriend would likely face criminal charges for their role in the false investigation into her murder.\n\nIn 2005, Rockhampton District Court judge Grant Britton punished Ryan's boyfriend Scott Black for perjury. Black received a three-year jail sentence which was suspended after twelve months after he pleaded guilty for telling investigating police officers that he didn't know the whereabout of his girlfriend.\n\nIn 2006, Natasha Ryan was found guilty of causing a false police investigation and was fined $1000. Police prosecutor Terry Gardiner produced the $120,000 contract Ryan had signed with PBL as evidence of Ryan having means to pay back at least some of the $151,000 police investigation into her murder. However, Magistrate Annette Hennessy ruled that Ryan did not have the means to pay the costs of the investigation. However, in the same court proceedings, Ryan's boyfriend, Scott Black was further punished by being convicted, being fined $3000 and being ordered to pay $16,000 towards investigation costs.\n\nIn 2011, Natasha Ryan's husband, Scott Black, pleaded guilty in Rockhampton Magistrates Court for refusing a breath test. In that incident, police were called to their home on 26 March 2011 after the couple were heard arguing about moving a vehicle into a garage. Black refused to take a breath test and was arrested. He was taken back to a police station when he again refused to take a breath test. Black's defence lawyer argued that Black had been drinking heavily and his judgement had been affected, and was frustrated because he had lost his job as a delivery driver because his licence was suspended. Magistrate Cameron Press fined Black $800 and disqualified him from driving for nine months.\n\nThe background of Leonard Fraser, a notorious serial killer with a horrifying criminal history is not able to be retold without reference to Natasha Ryan's feat of becoming an assumed victim of Fraser's but then being discovered alive during his murder trial. As illustrated by the deals media organisations have put forward to Ryan, and continouous references to her story in the years afterwards, public interest in Natasha Ryan's story has also been maintained since she was discovered alive in 2003.\n\n"}

According to the 2011 census it was the first language of 4,618,576 people in South Africa, principally in the provinces of Limpopo, Gauteng and Mpumalanga.\n\nNorthern Sotho is one of the Sotho languages of the Bantu family. Northern Sotho is thus most closely related to Southern Sotho (mostly referred to as just Sesotho), Setswana, sheKgalagari and siLozi. It is a standardized dialect, amalgamating several distinct varieties or dialects.\n\nUntil recently, \"Lobedu\" (also \"Khilovedu\" or \"Khelobedu\") used to exist only in an unwritten form, and the standard Northern Sotho language and orthography was usually used for teaching and writing by this language community. As of 2018, a Khilovedu dictionary is being compiled in addition to proper Khilovedu orthography which is also in the process of being developed. The monarch associated with this language community is Queen Modjadji (also known as the Rain Queen). Lobedu is spoken by a majority of people in the Greater Tzaneen, Greater Letaba, and BaPhalaborwa municipalities, and a minority in Greater Giyani municipality, as well as in the Limpopo Province and Tembisa township in Gauteng. Its speakers are known as the Balobedu\".\n\nSepulana (also sePulane) exists in unwritten form and forms part of the standard Northern Sotho. Sepulana is spoken in Bushbuckridge area by the MaPulana people.\n\nNorthern Sotho is often equated with the dialect it is primarily based on, Sepedi, and continued to be known as \"Pedi\" or \"Sepedi\" for some years after the new South African constitution appeared. However, the Pan South African Language Board and the Northern Sotho National Lexicography Unit now specifically endorse the names \"Northern Sotho\" or \"Sesotho sa Leboa\".\n\nThe original confusion arose from the fact that the (now official) Northern Sotho written language was based largely on the Sepedi dialect (from which missionaries first developed the orthography), but has subsequently provided a common writing system for 20 or more varieties of the Sotho-Tswana languages spoken in the former Transvaal. The name \"Sepedi\" thus refers specifically to the language of the Pedi people, while \"Northern Sotho\" refers to the official language of that name and to all the speech varieties it has been taken to cover.\n\nThe English version of the Constitution of South Africa refers to the language as \"Sepedi\". Its official translation into the language refers to it as \"Sesotho sa Leboa\" in the article about languages, but as \"Sepedi\" on the front page.\n\nApart from the Sepedi dialect itself, other languages or dialects covered by the term \"Northern Sotho\" appear to be a diverse grouping of communal speech-forms within the Sotho-Tswana group. They are apparently united by the fact that they are classifiable neither as Southern Sotho nor as Tswana.\n\nVery little published information is available on these other dialects of Northern Sotho, but these have been reported:\n\n\nThe morphological and possible lexical variation among these dialects has led to the above assertion that 'Northern Sotho' is no more than a holding category for otherwise unclassified Sotho-Tswana varieties spoken in northeastern South Africa. Maho (2002) leaves SePhalaborwa and the \"East Sotho\" varieties of SeKutswe, SePai, and SePulana unclassified within Sotho–Tswana. Their precise classification would appear to be a matter for further research.\n\nNorthern Sotho is written in the Latin alphabet. The letter š is used to represent the sound [] (\"sh\" is used in the trigraph \"tsh\" to represent an aspirated \"ts\" sound). Circumflex accent can be added to the letters e and o to distinguish their different sounds, but it is mostly used in language reference books. Some word prefixes, especially in verbs, are written separately from the stem.\n\nWithin nasal consonant compounds, the first nasal consonant sound is recognized as syllabic. Words such as \"nthuša\" \"help me\", are pronounced as . /n/ can also be pronounced as following a velar consonant.\n\nUrban varieties of Northern Sotho, such as Pretoria Sotho (actually a derivative of Tswana), have acquired clicks in an ongoing process of such sounds spreading from Nguni languages.\n\nSome examples of Northern Sotho words and phrases:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13844100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13844100", "title": "Pitch book", "text": "Pitch book\n\nA pitch book (also pitch deck) is a marketing presentation (information layout) used by investment banks around the world. It consists of a careful arrangement and analysis of the investment considerations of a potential or current client, and/or a reference for comparison for an employee in an investment or commercial bank. Its purpose is to secure a deal for the investment bank with the potential client.\n\nWhen an investment bank seeks new business, the starting point is the initial pitch or sales introduction. Investment banking traditionally adopts a highly formalised approach to making sales and will follow a tailored and highly effective sales strategy. If the bank is planning to be a participant and managing member of a share offering then it will make making agreeing to firm commitment underwriting, if the investment bank is planning to act as a lesser participant, involving less commitment, then it is agreeing to either a best efforts underwriting or \"standby\" commitment.\n\nFull-service investment banking conglomerates (a.k.a. \"Bulge Bracket\" banks), will compete to win the business of an established client as either the lead or co-manager of a syndicate. If a firm is less established, the firm, and not the investment bank, will make the pitch to secure the relationship. The founders and management of the business can do this through marketing a business plan or structured private placement. (See Regulation D) of the United States \"Securities Act\" of 1933\n\nThe pitch book is indigenous to the investment bank marketing itself to its clients. It represents valuable and detailed marketing material and provides the bank with a chance to show and prove why that investment bank should be considered amongst the wide variety of financing and other sources of capital and considerations in the financial marketplace (and a pitch book will typically go beyond simple comparisons of debt and equity costs and structures).\n\nThe pitch book is not to be confused with a public information book (\"PIB\"), which is an internal resource for the investment bankers to glean transactional and historic information of the intended industry a particular target firm may be in or may be heading towards. The PIB is an easy to access research source, which is usually maintained in the library of an investment bank.\n\nThe pitch book may employ a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats). \"Comps\", or Comparable Company Analysis may also be presented. In a \"comp\", an investment bank will present industry specific details, trends, macro- and microeconomic and company specific analysis, which will not only support the investment bank's vision but also support reasoning for a particular future valuation discussion for the potential client.\n\nThere are many contributors to an investment bank's pitch book. It starts with the analyst to the associate to the vice-president and senior vice-president (relationship managers) to the lead of the team, the managing director. As an example, a table of contents or outline will open the pitch book for discussion. Name, title, and department present a management description of the deal team and other contributors within the firm’s internal wealth of resources. An \"overview\", \"financing requirements (such as satisfying capital expenditures \"CAPEX\" and capital budgeting)\", and finally as mentioned a description of the company's universe, the \"comparable company analysis\" are all essential elements to an investment banking pitch book.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23221", "title": "Playboy", "text": "Playboy\n\nPlayboy is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine. It was founded in Chicago in 1953, by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner's mother. Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude models (Playmates), \"Playboy\" played an important role in the sexual revolution and remains one of the world's best-known brands, having grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc. (PEI), with a presence in nearly every medium. In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of \"Playboy\" are published worldwide.\n\nThe magazine has a long history of publishing short stories by notable novelists such as Arthur C. Clarke, Ian Fleming, Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, Chuck Palahniuk, P. G. Wodehouse, Roald Dahl, Haruki Murakami, and Margaret Atwood. With a regular display of full-page color cartoons, it became a showcase for notable cartoonists, including Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Cole, Eldon Dedini, Jules Feiffer, Shel Silverstein, Erich Sokol, Roy Raymonde, Gahan Wilson, and Rowland B. Wilson. \"Playboy\" features monthly interviews of notable public figures, such as artists, architects, economists, composers, conductors, film directors, journalists, novelists, playwrights, religious figures, politicians, athletes, and race car drivers. The magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, although it often interviews conservative celebrities.\nAfter a year-long removal of most nude photos in \"Playboy\" magazine, the March–April 2017 issue brought back nudity.\n\nBy spring 1953, Hugh Hefner—a 1949 University of Illinois psychology graduate who had worked in Chicago for \"Esquire\" magazine writing promotional copy; Publisher's Development Corporation in sales and marketing; and \"Children's Activities\" magazine as circulation promotions manager—had planned out the elements of his own magazine, that he would call \"Stag Party\". He formed HMH Publishing Corporation, and recruited his friend Eldon Sellers to find investors. Hefner eventually raised just over $8,000, including from his brother and mother. However, the publisher of an unrelated men's adventure magazine, \"Stag,\" contacted Hefner and informed him it would file suit to protect their trademark if he were to launch his magazine with that name. Hefner, his wife Millie, and Sellers met to seek a new name, considering \"Top Hat\", \"Gentleman\", \"Sir'\", \"Satyr\", \"Pan\" and \"Bachelor\" before Sellers suggested \"Playboy\".\n\nThe first issue, in December 1953, was undated, as Hefner was unsure there would be a second. He produced it in his Hyde Park kitchen. The first centerfold was Marilyn Monroe, although the picture used originally was taken for a calendar rather than for \"Playboy\". Hefner chose what he deemed the \"sexiest\" image, a previously unused nude study of Marilyn stretched with an upraised arm on a red velvet background with closed eyes and mouth open. The heavy promotion centered around Marilyn's nudity on the already-famous calendar, together with the teasers in marketing, made the new Playboy magazine a success.\nThe first issue sold out in weeks. Known circulation was 53,991. The cover price was 50¢. Copies of the first issue in mint to near mint condition sold for over $5,000 in 2002.\n\nThe novel \"Fahrenheit 451\", by Ray Bradbury, was published in 1953 and serialized in the March, April and May 1954 issues of \"Playboy\".\n\nAn urban legend started about Hefner and the Playmate of the Month because of markings on the front covers of the magazine. From 1955 to 1979 (except for a six-month gap in 1976), the \"P\" in \"Playboy\" had stars printed in or around the letter. The legend stated that this was either a rating that Hefner gave to the Playmate according to how attractive she was, the number of times that Hefner had slept with her, or how good she was in bed. The stars, between zero and 12, actually indicated the domestic or international advertising region for that printing.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1976, Robie Macauley was the Fiction Editor at \"Playboy\". During this period the magazine published fiction by Saul Bellow, Seán Ó Faoláin, John Updike, James Dickey, John Cheever, Doris Lessing, Joyce Carol Oates, Vladimir Nabokov, Michael Crichton, John le Carré, Irwin Shaw, Jean Shepherd, Arthur Koestler, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bernard Malamud, John Irving, Anne Sexton, Nadine Gordimer, Kurt Vonnegut and J. P. Donleavy, as well as poetry by Yevgeny Yevtushenko.\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can.\" These included copies of \"Playboy\" and \"Cosmopolitan\" magazines. One of the key pamphlets produced by the protesters was \"No More Miss America!\", by Robin Morgan which listed ten characteristics of the Miss America pageant that the authors believed degraded women; it compared the pageant to \"Playboy\"'s centerfold as sisters under the skin, describing this as \"The Unbeatable Madonna-Whore Combination.\"\n\nMacauley contributed all of the popular \"Ribald Classics\" series published between January 1978 and March 1984.\n\nSince reaching its peak in the 1970s, \"Playboy\" saw a decline in circulation and cultural relevance due to competition in the field it founded—first from \"Penthouse,\" then \"Oui\" (which was published as a spin-off of \"Playboy\") and \"Gallery\" in the 1970s; later from pornographic videos; and more recently from lad mags such as \"Maxim,\" \"FHM,\" and \"Stuff.\" In response, \"Playboy\" has attempted to re-assert its hold on the 18–35 male demographic through slight changes to content and focusing on issues and personalities more appropriate to its audience—such as hip-hop artists being featured in the \"\"Playboy\" Interview\".\n\nChristie Hefner, daughter of the founder Hugh Hefner, joined Playboy in 1975 and became head of the company in 1988. She announced in December 2008 that she would be stepping down from leading the company, effective in January 2009, and said that the election of Barack Obama as the next President had inspired her to give more time to charitable work, and that the decision to step down was her own. \"Just as this country is embracing change in the form of new leadership, I have decided that now is the time to make changes in my own life as well,\" she said.\n\nThe magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary with the January 2004 issue. Celebrations were held at Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, and Moscow during the year to commemorate this event. Playboy also launched limited-edition products designed by a number of notable fashion-houses such as Versace, Vivienne Westwood and Sean John. As a hommage to the magazine 50th anniversary, MAC Cosmetics released two limited-edition products, namely a lipstick and a glitter cream.\n\nThe magazine runs several annual features and ratings. One of the most popular is its annual ranking of the top \"party schools\" among all U.S. universities and colleges. In 2009, the magazine used five criteria: bikini, brains, campus, sex and sports in the development of its list. The top ranked party school by \"Playboy\" for 2009 was the University of Miami.\n\nIn June 2009, the magazine reduced its publication schedule to 11 issues per year, with a combined July/August issue. On August 11, 2009, London's \"Daily Telegraph\" newspaper reported that Hugh Hefner had sold his English Manor house (next door to the famous Playboy Mansion) for $18 m ($10 m less than the reported asking price) to another American, Daren Metropoulos the President and co-owner of Pabst Blue Ribbon and that due to significant losses in the company's value (down from $1 billion in 2000 to $84 million in 2009), the Playboy publishing empire is up for sale for $300 million. In December 2009, they further reduced the publication schedule to 10 issues per year, with a combined January/February issue.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced Hefner's $5.50 per share offer ($122.5 million based on shares outstanding on April 30 and the closing price on July 9) to buy the portion of the company he did not already own and take the company private with the help of Rizvi Traverse Management LLC. The company derives much of its income from licensing rather than the magazine. On July 15, \"Penthouse\" owner FriendFinder Networks Inc. offered $210 million (the company is valued at $185 million), though Hefner, who already owned 70 percent of voting stock, did not want to sell. In January 2011, the publisher of \"Playboy\" magazine agreed to an offer by Hefner to take the company private for $6.15 per share, an 18 percent premium over the price of the last previous day of trading. The buyout was completed in March 2011.\n\nIn October 2015, Playboy announced that starting with their March 2016 issue, the magazine would no longer feature full frontal nudity. \"Playboy\" CEO Scott Flanders acknowledged the magazine's inability to compete with freely available Internet pornography and nudity; according to him, \"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just passé at this juncture\". Hefner agreed with the decision. The redesigned \"Playboy\", however, would still feature a Playmate of the Month and pictures of women, but they would be rated as not appropriate for children under 13. The move would not affect PlayboyPlus.com (which features nudity at a paid subscription). Josh Horwitz of Quartz argued that the motivation for the decision to remove nudity from the magazine was to give Playboy Licensing a less inappropriate image in India and China, where the brand is a popular item on apparel and thus generates significant revenue.\n\nAmong other changes to the magazine included ending the popular jokes section and the various cartoons that appeared throughout the magazine. The redesign eliminated the use of jump copy (articles continuing on non-consecutive pages), which in turn eliminated most of the space for cartoons. Hefner, himself a former cartoonist, reportedly resisted dropping the cartoons more than the nudity, but ultimately obliged. \"Playboy\"s plans were to market itself as a competitor to \"Vanity Fair\" as opposed to more traditional competitors \"GQ\" and \"Maxim\".\n\nPlayboy announced in February 2017, however, that the dropping of nudity had been a mistake, and furthermore for its March/April issue reestablished some of its franchises, including The Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes, but dropped the subtitle \"Entertainment for Men\" inasmuch as gender roles have evolved. The announcement was made by the company's chief creative officer on Twitter with the hashtag #NakedIsNormal.\n\nIn 2017 the magazine announced it would become a bi-monthly publication.\n\nIn early 2018, and according to Jim Puzzanghera of the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Playboy\" was reportedly \"considering killing the print magazine,\" as the publication \"has lost as much as $7 million annually in recent years.\" However, in the July/August 2018 issue a reader asked if the print magazine would discontinue, and Playboy responded that it was not going anywhere.\n\nIn September of 2018 the magazine announced it would move to publishing quarterly beginning in 2019. \n\nThe best-selling \"Playboy\" edition was the November 1972 edition, which sold 7,161,561 copies. One-quarter of all American college men were buying or subscribing to the magazine every month. On the cover was model Pam Rawlings, photographed by Rowland Scherman.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, a cropped image of the issue's centerfold (which featured Lena Söderberg) became a de facto standard image for testing image processing algorithms. It is known simply as the \"Lenna\" (also \"Lena\") image in that field.\n\nIn 1970, \"Playboy\" became the first gentleman's magazine to be printed in braille. It is also one of the few magazines whose microfilm format was in color, not black and white.\n\nPlayboy's iconic and enduring mascot, a stylized silhouette of a rabbit wearing a tuxedo bow tie, was created by \"Playboy\" art director Art Paul for the second issue as an endnote, but was adopted as the official logo and has appeared ever since. A running joke in the magazine involves hiding the logo somewhere in the cover art or photograph. Hefner said he chose the rabbit for its \"humorous sexual connotation\", and because the image was \"frisky and playful\".\nIn an interview Hefner explained his choice of a rabbit as \"Playboy's\" logo to the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci:\n\nThe jaunty rabbit was quickly a popular symbol of extroverted male culture, becoming a lucrative source of merchandizing revenue for Playboy. In the 1950s, it was adopted as military aircraft insignia for the Navy's VX-4 fighter-evaluation squadron.\n\nBesides its centerfold, a major part of \"Playboy\" for much of its existence has been the \"Playboy\" Interview, an extensive (usually several thousand-word) discussion between a notable individual and an interviewer (historian Alex Haley, for example, served as a \"Playboy\" interviewer on a few occasions; one of his interviews was with Martin Luther King Jr.; he also interviewed Malcolm X and American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell in the April 1966 issue, then coauthored Malcolm X's autobiography). One of the magazine's most notable interviews was a discussion with then-presidential candidate Jimmy Carter in the November 1976 issue, in which he stated \"I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\" David Sheff's interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono appeared in the January 1981 issue, which was on newsstands at the time of Lennon's murder; the interview was later published in book format.\n\nAnother interview type section, entitled \"20Q\" (a play on the game of Twenty Questions), was added in October 1978. Cheryl Tiegs was the first interviewee for the section.\n\n\"Rock the Rabbit\" was an annual music news and pictorial feature published in the March edition. The pictorial featured images of rock bands photographed by music photographer Mick Rock. Fashion designers participated in the Rock the Rabbit event by designing T-shirts inspired by Playboy's rabbit head logo for each band. The shirts were sold at Playboy's retailers and auctioned off to raise money for AIDS at LIFEbeat: The Music Industry Fights AIDS. Notable bands who were featured include: MGMT, Daft Punk, Iggy Pop, Duran Duran, Flaming Lips, Snow Patrol, and The Killers.\n\nMany notable photographers have contributed to \"Playboy\", including Ken Marcus, Richard Fegley, Arny Freytag, Ron Harris, Tom Kelley, David Mecey, Russ Meyer, Pompeo Posar, Suze Randall, Herb Ritts, Stephen Wayda, Sam Wu, Mario Casilli, Annie Leibovitz, Helmut Newton, and Bunny Yeager.\n\nMany celebrities (singers, actresses, models, etc.) have posed for \"Playboy\" over the years. This list is only a small portion of those who have posed. Some of them are:\n\nThe success of \"Playboy\" magazine has led PEI to market other versions of the magazine, the Special Editions (formerly called \"Newsstand Specials\"), such as \"Playboy's College Girls\" and \"Playboy's Book of Lingerie\", as well as the \"Playboy\" video collection.\n\nThe National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) has published a Braille edition of \"Playboy\" since 1970. The Braille version includes all the written words in the non-Braille magazine, but no pictorial representations. Congress cut off funding for the Braille magazine translation in 1985, but U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan reversed the decision on First Amendment grounds.\n\nThe growth of the Internet prompted the magazine to develop an official web presence called \"Playboy\" Online or Playboy.com, which is the official website for Playboy Enterprises, and an online companion to \"Playboy\" magazine. The site has been available online since 1994. As part of the online presence, Playboy developed a pay web site called the \"Playboy Cyber Club\" in 1995 which features online chats, additional pictorials, videos of Playmates and Playboy Cyber Girls that are not featured in the magazine. Archives of past \"Playboy\" articles and interviews are also included. In September 2005, Playboy launched the online edition of the magazine \"Playboy Digital\".\n\nIn 2010, Playboy introduced \"The Smoking Jacket\", a safe-for-work website designed to appeal to young men, while avoiding nude images or key words that would cause the site to be filtered or otherwise prohibited in the workplace.\n\nIn May 2011, Playboy introduced i.playboy.com, a complete, uncensored version of its near 700 issue archive, targeting the Apple iPad. By launching the archive as a web app, Playboy was able to circumvent both Apple's App Store content restrictions and their 30% subscription fee.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that Playboy Enterprises Inc.'s trademark terms \"Playboy\" and \"Playmate\" should be protected in the situation where a user typing \"Playboy\" or \"Playmate\" in a browser search was instead shown advertisements of companies that competed with PEI. This decision reversed an earlier district court ruling. The suit started on April 15, 1999, when Playboy sued Excite Inc. and Netscape for trademark infringement.\n\nMany in the American religious community opposed the publication of \"Playboy\". The Louisiana pastor and author L. L. Clover wrote in his 1974 treatise \"Evil Spirits Intellectualism and Logic\" that \"Playboy\" encouraged young men to view themselves as \"pleasure-seeking individuals for whom sex is fun and women are play things.\"\n\nIn many parts of Asia, including India, mainland China, Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Brunei, sale and distribution of \"Playboy\" is banned. In addition, sale and distribution is banned in most Muslim countries (except Lebanon and Turkey) in Asia and Africa, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. Despite the ban on the magazine in these countries, the official \"Playboy\" brand itself can still appear on various merchandise such as perfume and deodorants.\n\nWhile banned in mainland China, the magazine is sold in Hong Kong. In Japan, where genitals of models cannot be shown, a separate edition was published under license by Shueisha. An Indonesian edition was launched in April 2006, but controversy started before the first issue hit the stands. Though the publisher said the content of the Indonesian edition will be different from the original edition, the government tried to ban it by using anti-pornography rules. A Muslim organization, the Islamic Defenders Front (IDF), opposed \"Playboy\" on the grounds of pornography. On April 12, about 150 IDF members clashed with police and stoned the editorial offices. Despite this, the edition quickly sold out. On April 6, 2007, the chief judge of the case dismissed the charges because they had been incorrectly filed.\n\nIn 1986, the American convenience store chain 7-Eleven removed the magazine. The store returned \"Playboy\" to its shelves in late 2003. 7-Eleven had also been selling \"Penthouse\" and other similar magazines before the ban.\n\nIn 1995, \"Playboy\" was returned to shelves in the Republic of Ireland after a 36-year ban, despite staunch opposition from many women's groups.\n\n\"Playboy\" was not sold in the state of Queensland, Australia during 2004 and 2005 but returned as of 2006. Due to declining sales, the last Australia-wide edition of \"Playboy\" was the January 2000 issue.\n\nIn 2013, \"Playboy\" was cleared by the Pentagon of violating its rule against selling sexually explicit material on military property, but the base exchanges stopped selling it anyway.\n\nIn March 2018, Playboy announced they would be deactivating their Facebook accounts due to the \"sexually repressive\" nature of the social media platform and their mismanagement of user data resulting from the Cambridge Analytica problem.\n\nGeneral compilations\n\nAnniversary collections\n\nInterview compilations\n\n\nOfficial\n\nOthers\n"}

{"id": "31319117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31319117", "title": "Prakashanand Saraswati", "text": "Prakashanand Saraswati\n\nSwami Prakashanand Saraswati or Swamiji (Hindi: स्वामी प्रकाशानंद सरस्वती) (born 15 January 1929) is a convicted felon and child molester, spiritual leader, social reformer and award-winning author from Ayodhya, India who founded Radha Madhav Dham in the United States. He is a Rasik Saint in the tradition of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In 2011, a jury found Swami Prakashanand Saraswati guilty on 20 counts of indecency with a child. He is still a fugitive and appeared on the Fox TV show \"America's Most Wanted\".\n\nSwami Prakashanand Saraswati was of the lineage of the great Vashnavite sage of West Bengal Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534). Followers of Vaishnavism, as well as other schools of Hinduism, believe that a great Guru can teach disciples even after the guru is no longer in a physical body. Communication between the visible and invisible is taken for granted and is an essential factor in many types of Hinduism. Chaitanya is assumed to be in charge of his lineage even today. Swami Prakashanand Saraswati described:\n\nOur tradition of \"raganuga bhakti\" is eternal. It comes from the Vedas. Around 3,102 BC Krishna Himself descended on the earth planet in His Divine form and Ved Vyas re-established the same knowledge through the Bhagwatam which continues until today. Five hundred years ago, the descension of Radha in the form of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu further revealed, rejuvenated and established this form of devotion which became the guideline for the devotees of today. This tradition is called \"achintya bhedabhed vad\".\n\nApart from a life oriented on either sense gratification or the practice of \"yogic\" and psychic disciplines (considered to be merely the exploration of the inner world of \"maya\"), Swami Prakashanand Saraswati taught the path of God's love and the development of an affinity toward, and personal feeling of love for Godhead Personality. This devotional approach is explained in the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and the Bhagavata Purana. It is centred upon the remembrance of Krishna and chanting his name while devotionally offering one's emotional feeling to Him.\n\nSwami Prakashanand Saraswati was born in a respectable \"brahmin\" family in 1929 in Ayodhya, India. His early life was fraught with intense religious feelings, and as a youth he became a reclusive mystic so that he might find God. He completed his studies and at age of 21, renounced the world and took the order of \"sanyas\". In 1952, he was offered to become the Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath but he declined, because, according to Swami Prakshanand Saraswati, he \"was drawn towards the love of Radha Krishna\".\n\nHe spent the next 20 years as a wandering ascetic in the Himalayas and in the forests of central India, ending in Braj. Following the strict discipline of sannyas, he first lived in the Himalayas (Joshimath, Badrinath, Rishikesh, Haridwar, etc.), forests of Amarkantak, near the Narbada River, Allahabad and Kashi for about four years. Later, he went to Vrindaban and then to Barsana where he spent over 18 years in the deep woodlands of Braj. In 1975, he emerged from his solitary life he began his mission of teaching the path of \"raganuga bhakti\". He founded the International Society of Divine Love in India in 1975. The society was established in New Zealand in 1978. Later on he travelled to America and founded an ashram for his devotees and disciples. By 1981 Swami Prakashanand Saraswati, who had begun to be thought of as a distinguished sage and a saint, conceived of creating a global mission, establishing religious centres in India, England, Ireland, Singapore, New Zealand, and Australia.\n\nSwami Prakashanand Saraswati has written over nine books on various aspects of Hindu ethics, scriptures and practices. He has represented the Hindu religion at the Millennium World Peace Summit.\n\nIn 1999 he wrote \"The True History and the Religion of India: A Concise Encyclopedia of Authentic Hinduis\", a \"monumental dissertation\" on the history of Indian civilization and religion. The eight-hundred-page tome is entitled \"The True History and the Religion of India\". It is a comprehensive history of religion in Indian culture. The book has received laudatory comments from prominent Hindu academics and leaders in the United States and India. It was released by The Minister of State for Information & Broadcasting Shri Ramesh Bais. The encyclopaedia won an award at the World Religious Parliament in New Delhi in 1999. In 2001, the book was published by Motilal Banarsidass. It has subsequently been published by Macmillan Publishers.\n\nA simplified and abridged version of the book for college students, entitled Amazing Facts about Hinduism, was released at the Global Dharma Conference in 2003. He was awarded the title of \"Dharm Chakravarti\" in India for his efforts in \"reestablishing authentic Hinduism\".\n\nHis writings in the scientific and spiritual fields have been acclaimed by well known scientists, social and religious leaders including P. S. Veeraraghavan, Tarun Vijay, Om Prakash Pande, E. C. George Sudarshan, Jayendra Saraswathi and Swaroopanand Saraswati.\n\nSwami Prakashanand Saraswati's state of \"conscious ecstasy\", and the effects of his Divine Love Meditation, was studied by Dr. Maxwell Cade in the 1970s.\n\nDr. Maxwell Cade, a leading physicist of London, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, had been doing psycho-biological research during the 1970s on meditation and the altered states of the consciousness of the mind.\n\nMaxwell Cade co-developed the \"Mind Mirror\", a portable EEG machine that could monitor the alpha, beta, delta and theta rhythms from each brain hemisphere simultaneously. In the 1970s, a number of eastern religious teachers expressed an interest in participating in Maxwell Cade's research, and agreed to have their brain rhythms measured. In 1976 when he was touring England, Swami Prakashanand Saraswati requested to participate in Dr. Maxwell Cade's research. Dr. Maxwell Cade and his team found patterns they had not seen before. Maxwell Cade concluded that the Swamis' spiritual training conferred unusual powers of healing and perception.\n\nDr. Cade spent two weeks with Prakashanand Saraswati to measure his brainwaves, and he always seemed to be in this \"Awakened Mind\" pattern. Furthermore, he measured brainwave patterns, only previously measured in a few rare individuals, that Maxwell Cade characterizes as the \"State beyond the Awakened Mind\". Cade commented: \". . . he has attained to that level of consciousness at which he is in the higher reaches of meditation and in everyday waking consciousness at the same time\". On one occasion, Maxwell Cade says that Saraswati \"produced the most beautiful fifth-state pattern on the Mind Mirror for more than an hour while engaging in an intense debate with Professor John Hasted, a noted physicist\". Saraswati wanted to test out the effects of his new form of meditation called the \"Divine Love Meditation.\" He had Maxwell Cade test subjects while listening to a tape consisting of chanting and they measured the effects. According to Cade, both experienced and non-meditators were able to produce a form of \"Awakened Mind\" pattern while listening to these tapes.\n\nHe writes, \"Those who have close contact with His Divinity know that he remains continually in his Divine-Love transcendence. This corresponds to what Carl Jung termed 'the Transcendent Function.'\" Further, Cade writes that he \"had not seen anyone who could equal Swamiji's feat of touching a number of subjects on the head and immediately raising their pattern of consciousness by two levels, from the ordinary waking state into the advanced fifth state. In at least one of these subjects, the higher state persisted for three days and was an unforgettable experience.\" Cade's wife reportedly had an \"unforgettable experience\" from meeting Swami Prakashanand Saraswati and participating in the study. Maxwell Cade characterised it as \"an experience of great impact\". It was, he wrote later: \". . . a perfect opportunity to study his remarkable EEG patterns under varying circumstances, to discuss the application of scientific methods to the study of meditation, and to learn about Divine Love Meditation at the feet of this great Master\". \nCade published his research in his \"landmark book\", \"The Awakened Mind\". Cade's research with Swami Prakashanand Saraswati has also been discussed in several other publications including by Hill (1979), Inglis & West (1983), Treece (1989) and Peake (2013).\n\nCade showed evidence for temporary and in some cases long-term elevation of state even after twenty minutes of Divine Love Meditation.\n\nIn 2007, three former residents of Barsana Dham (Radha Madhav Dham), aged between 27 and 30 years old, told Hays County, Texas police that they had been abused at the ashram by Saraswati, who was then arrested on 25 April 2008.\n\nA 12-person jury declared Saraswati guilty of 20 counts of child molestation, after 50 minutes deliberation, on Friday 4 March 2011. After being convicted, he was released on a $10 million bond provided by TV infomercial entrepreneur Peter Spiegel. As part of the bond condition, Saraswati was barred from entering the Barsana Dham.\n\nIn April, following the disappearance of its founder the ashram changed its name.\n\nProsecutors were criticized for losing evidence required for his defense. The evidence included missing video of the testimony of one of the accusers, damaged DVD backup discs and computers. Saraswati's lawyers said the video tape was important because “There’s no physical evidence of any kind” and \"it represents the primary method by which Defendant's counsel can impeach the complainant's testimony at trial.\"\n\nRadha Madhav Dham has distanced itself from Saraswati. One month after the trial, then \"Barsana Dham\" leaders \"changed the organization's name and erased the once-omnipresent images and mentions of the former guru from the premises.\"\n\nIn 2012, on the one year anniversary of the trial, Vrinda Devi, Radha Madhav Dham spokeswoman, stated that \"What we've been trying to do since then is moving forward.\"\n\nThe punishment phase of trial was scheduled for Monday morning of 7 March 2011. However, Saraswati didn't show up for his trial and his disciples and legal team said that they didn't know his whereabouts. Defense attorney Jeff Kearney said he believed his client's health was the likely reason behind Saraswati's absence. The jury sentenced him \"in absentia\" to 280 years and a US$200,000 fine. At the penalty hearing, Spiegel said he hadn't understood the terms of the original bond agreement. On 4 November 2011, Texas Watchdog reported that he had been required to pay only $200,000 of the $10 million bond, plus the previously disclosed $1 million. Hays County attempted to keep the amount secret but a Nov 2011 ruling from the state Attorney General's office made it clear that the amount is clearly public record. Federal officials believe Saraswati's followers moved him to Mexico in March 2011, and then helped him travel to India on a fake passport in November 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "35208653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35208653", "title": "Programa Nacional de Población", "text": "Programa Nacional de Población\n\nPrograma Nacional de Población was a program conducted in Peru in the early 1990s to reduce population growth as a way of meeting international demographic standards. Compulsory sterilization, which is a method that forces individuals to partake in sterilization operations, was the main method employed by the Peruvian government to decrease population. While the motives and practices for such sterilizations vary, Compulsory Sterilization in the case of Peru under President Alberto Fujimori was a program strictly intended to lower national population growth by decreasing the fertility rate among women. The program, titled \"Programa Nacional de Población\" (National Population Program), was directed at Peru's impoverished, indigenous, and marginalized communities and therefore implied the government's intention to diminish the rural population in order to enhance future economic growth.\n\nThe social and political climate of Peru in the 1990s at the time of the aforementioned sterilization program was the result of decades of class struggle and institutionalized inequality. Peru is a country that has long been subordinate to oligarchy in its society and as a result the class divide between a handful of \"powerful individuals\" and the remaining \"poor and impotent majority\" is significant.\n\nThis issue of class - in addition to Peru's political instability and dependency on capitalist order from international governments - left the country in a vulnerable political, social, and economic position. In positions such as these, the poor are left inevitably to suffer from the failed policies of the upper class. This vulnerable state proved to be detrimental to Peru's constitutional government and civil society when the military overthrew President Fernando Belaúnde Terry in 1968 and remained in occupation of the government for an entire decade. Within this decade-long military regime under appointed President Juan Velasco Alvarado, Peruvian government made significant leftist reforms and intended to give justice to the poor. However, these reforms were unsuccessful and the poor and indigenous suffered as the country plummeted further into debt. It was not until 1979, under General Francisco Morales Bermúdez that Peru adopted a new national constitution and focused on regaining economic strength within the country.\n\nUnder this new constitution, population growth and families' rights to fertility were topics of political concern. As a result of this new focus, the Ministry of Health began to offer public services towards family planning in 1983. In 1985, the National Population Policy Law was passed and shortly thereafter the National Population Program was established.\n\nThe population policy law, which continues to be in effect, intends to promote \"a balanced relationship between population size, structure and distribution, and socio-economic development.\" The law also specifically catered to the enhancement and protection of the human rights of Peruvian citizens with its promise to ensure voluntary and informed consent in issues regarding contraception and health services. However, Peru's government was still in the midst of internal conflict. Due to a lack of political support, there was not enough funding for the programs needed to carry out the National Population Policy Law. As a result, implementation of the law remained stagnant until the presidency of Alberto Fujimori in 1990. In 1991, a new National Population Program was developed, known as \"Programa Nacional de Población\". Although Fujimori was an avid public supporter of family planning, the new National Population Program and its specific goals and strategies seemingly counteracted the law's initial purpose of preserving individual human rights.\n\nAs of 1992, Peru was ranked as having the fifth highest population in the Latin American region with an estimated number of 22,767,543 inhabitants. The country is generally split into three geographic regions: the coastal region, the highlands, and the selva (Amazon region). As of 1990, the demographics for these areas were as follows: 53% of the nation's population in the coastal region, 36% percent in the highlands, and 11% in the selva. The National Population Program under Fujimori focused heavily on highland population, as it was the region inhabited by the largest amount of the country's indigenous peoples.\n\nThe chart below portrays the demographic evolution of Peru since the year 1520. The green colored points on the chart mark the population at the time of the Inca Empire prior to Spanish conquest. The yellow marks the population during Spanish colonization. The red signifies population during the independent republic of what Peru is today, and the blue is the projected population by the National Institute of Statistics and Information Technology (\"Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática\") up until the year 2050.\n\nThe issue of population growth in Peru is directly connected with the social, political and economic inequality within the country. The average number of childbirths for Peruvian women is higher than that of Latin America's general average and also higher than the average of women in the United States. As for the comparison of birth rates within the country, 1.7 is the average number of children per woman with a university or college education while the average is 6.2 children per woman for those who have little or no education. Women living in rural areas, mostly of indigenous descent, have the highest average birth rate at 7.1 children per woman.\n\nIn the Andean countryside, the maternal mortality ratio is \"very high for the region\" at 185 deaths per 100,000 live births. In addition, there are 66 abortions for every 100 live births, even though abortion is illegal in Peru and therefore is most likely conducted with high risk.\n\nThe issues that arise from this discrepancy in birth rates are troubling. When looking solely at statistics, it can be said that the high birth rate among the lower classes of society continues the cycle of poverty. However, it must also be noted that the reason for such high birth rates is linked to factors such as the lack of access to education and income disparity.\n\nWith the newly drafted version of the National Population Program (\"Programa Nacional de Población\") under Fujimori, goals were specified in the context of demographics. The Peruvian Ministry of Health's program manager stated that impoverished indigenous women are \"poor and producing more poor people. The President is aware that the government cannot fight poverty without reducing the poor people's fertility. Thus, demographic goals are a combination of the population's right to access family planning and the government's anti-poverty strategy.\" The program was targeted towards poor women who had \"little or no formal education\". Thus, the program intended to:\n\n\nThe National Population program called on both public and private sectors to assist in its strategic implementation. Furthermore, seven strategies were laid out as guidelines to reach the intended demographic goals:\n\n\nBecause these strategies required the cooperation of various institutions, the program failed to be carried out with ease yet again due to the lack of coherence within the involved political sectors and agencies. Many agencies \"lacked sufficient power to carry out [its] functions\" and others were either \"not interested\" or opposed to working in agreement \"due to inter-institutional rivalries\". Peru's internal conflict from decades past continued to work against the overall productivity of the institution and its ability to sufficiently serve constituents.\n\nFunding was also a crucial issue that proved to be an additional setback to the National Population Program. In Peruvian government, as with many Latin American countries, the Catholic Church held significant power over issues both public and private. Essentially, the moral support of the distinguished members of the Church would result in financial support. However the Catholic community looked down upon the National Population Program due to its promise to provide modern contraceptives. Knowing fully well that his program would not be a success without the Catholic Church's approval, President Fujimori \"toned down\" the program's focus on contraception.\n\nWithout full support from the Catholic Church, outside funding was required for the program's success. International pressure to meet population standards became evident when the International Monetary Fund suggested that the Peruvian government cut funding for social services to allow for more spending in areas called for by the program. In addition, USAID (United States Agency for International Development) contributed US$85 million between 1994 and 1998. Because the financial support from foreign donors brought economic and political pressure upon Fujimori to meet international standards, the plan to decrease population growth consequently became more focused on quotas than individual rights and health issues.\n\nAfter the goals were defined and the funding for the National Population Program was in place, the number of annual sterilizations in Peru rose drastically. Prior to the program, there were less than 15,000 sterilizations performed per year and women could only have the operation performed \"if they had a health risk, four or more children, or were above a certain age\". However, after 1995 when sterilizations began to be performed, there were no pre-existing conditions necessary for sterilizations other than that women had to be considered part of Peru's poor and disenfranchised community. In addition, the number of annual sterilization procedures rose after the program's implementation from 15,000 to 67,000 in 1996 and 115,000 in 1997.\n\nThe program's implementation also brought up several issues in terms of the quality and care of the procedures. Most of the personnel hired to perform sterilizations were not properly trained and much of the equipment used was outdated and lacking in quality. The counseling services provided to patients were also backed by poorly trained staff and many women were not given \"quality information prior to procedures\". When sterilizations were given, they were done so in a hurriedly manner. \"Teams were dispatchd one day at a time to perform procedures\" and therefore attempted to cover large masses of women in rural areas in very minimal amounts of time. As a result, patients were denied sufficient and proper treatment and rarely received follow-up care.\n\nBribery, threats, and deception were methods used in the implementation of such procedures by medical personnel. A large number of the indigenous Peruvian population speaks Quechua and are unable to read, write, and sometimes even communicate in Spanish. Many women were deceived by personnel and told that the procedures were operations other than sterilization. There were also instances of men being told they would be fined or jailed if they did not order their wives to have the operation. A former physician for the Ministry of Health confirms these practices:\n\n\"We were required to perform a certain number of sterilizations each month. This was obligatory and if we did not comply, we were fired. Many providers did not inform women that they were going to be sterilized - they told them that the procedure was something else. But I felt this was wrong. I preferred to offer women a bag of rice to convince them to accept the procedure and explained to them beforehand what was going to happen.\"\n\nBecause the procedures of the National Population Program went against Peru's constitutional law and violated human rights law, foreign donors threatened to suspend support for any aspects of the program that were sterilization related. Many public organizations, such as \"Centro de la Mujer Peruana Flora Tristán\" and the \"Comité de América Latina y el Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer\" (CLADEM), began to voice their concerns for the program and attempt to obtain evidence against the Ministry of Health and the Peruvian government for their covert actions. In 1997, the newspaper \"La República\" reported on the human rights violations of the National Population Program and sparked a nationwide debate that brought the government's actions to the forefront of Peruvian media.\n\nIn 1998, the Peruvian government and the Ministry of Health agreed to reform the controversial aspects of the National Population Program. The elimination of numeric goals was arguably the most important change to the program as demographic goals and quotas were no longer needed. While sterilization was not eliminated entirely, the reforms for the implementation of the procedure included:\n\nFinally, the language of the National Population Program was also changed. Rather than a target of 2.5 births per woman as it was written in the original law in 1991, the reformed program intended to \"reach a total fertility rate compatible with the individual reproductive intentions\".\n"}
{"id": "711550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=711550", "title": "Rational emotive behavior therapy", "text": "Rational emotive behavior therapy\n\nRational emotive behavior therapy (REBT), previously called rational therapy and rational emotive therapy, is an active-directive, philosophically and empirically based psychotherapy, the aim of which is to resolve emotional and behavioral problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. REBT was created and developed by the American psychotherapist and psychologist Albert Ellis, who was inspired by many of the teachings of Asian, Greek, Roman and modern philosophers. REBT is the first form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and was first expounded by Ellis in the mid-1950s; development continued until his death in 2007. Ellis became synonymous with the highly influential therapy. Psychology Today noted, \"No individual — not even Freud himself — has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.\nRational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is both a psychotherapeutic system of theory and practices and a school of thought established by Albert Ellis. Ellis first presented his ideas at a conference of the American Psychological Association in 1956 then published a seminal article in 1957 entitled \"Rational psychotherapy and individual psychology\", in which he set the foundation for what he was calling Rational Therapy (RT) and carefully responded to questions from Rudolf Dreikurs and others about the similarities and differences with Alfred Adler's Individual psychology. This was around a decade before psychiatrist Aaron Beck first set forth his \"cognitive therapy\", after Ellis had contacted him in the mid 1960s. Ellis' own approach was renamed to \"Rational Emotive Therapy\" in 1959, then to the current term in 1992.\n\nPrecursors of certain fundamental aspects of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy have been identified in ancient philosophical traditions, particularly Stoicism. In his first major book on rational therapy, Ellis wrote that the central principle of his approach, that people are rarely emotionally affected by external events but rather by their thinking about such events, \"was originally discovered and stated by the ancient Stoic philosophers\". Ellis illustrates this with a quote from the \"Enchiridion\" of Epictetus: \"Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them.\" Ellis noted that Shakespeare expressed a similar thought in \"Hamlet\": \"There's nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so.\" Ellis also acknowledges early 20th century therapists, particularly Paul Charles Dubois, though he only read his work several years after developing his therapy. \n\nA fundamental premise of REBT is humans do not get emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed as far back as the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the \"A-B-C\"-\"D-E-F\" model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an \"A\", \"a\"dversity (or \"a\"ctivating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral \"C\"s, \"c\"onsequences, but also what people \"B\", irrationally \"b\"elieve about the \"A\", \"a\"dversity. \"A\", \"a\"dversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.\n\nWhere the following letters represent the following meanings in this model\n\nA- The adversity\n\nB- The developed belief in the person of the A Adversity\n\nC- The consequences but the consequences of that person's Beliefs ie B\n\nD- The person's disputes of A B and C. In latter thought.\n\nE- The effective new philosophy or belief that develops in that person through the occurrence of D in their minds of A and B\n\nF- The developed feelings of ones self either at point and after point C or at point after point E.\nThe \"B\"s, irrational beliefs that are most important in the \"A-B-C\" model are explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The \"B\"s, \"b\"eliefs that are most significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person's evaluative \"B\", \"b\"elief about the \"A\", \"a\"ctivating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the \"C\", the emotional and behavioral \"c\"onsequence, is likely to be self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person's belief is preferential, flexible and constructive, the \"C\", the emotional and behavioral \"c\"onsequence is likely to be self-helping and constructive.\n\nThrough REBT, by understanding the role of their mediating, evaluative and philosophically based illogical, unrealistic and self-defeating meanings, interpretations and assumptions in disturbance, individuals can learn to identify them, then go to \"D\", \"d\"isputing and questioning the evidence for them. At \"E, e\"ffective new philosophy, they can recognize and reinforce the notion no evidence exists for any psychopathological \"must\", \"ought\" or \"should\" and distinguish them from healthy constructs, and subscribe to more constructive and self-helping philosophies. This new reasonable perspective leads to \"F\", new \"f\"eelings and behaviors appropriate to the \"A\" they are addressing in the exercise.\n\nThe REBT framework assumes that humans have both innate rational (meaning self-helping, socially helping, and constructive) and irrational (meaning self-defeating, socially defeating, and unhelpful) tendencies and leanings. REBT claims that people to a large degree consciously and unconsciously construct emotional difficulties such as self-blame, self-pity, clinical anger, hurt, guilt, shame, depression and anxiety, and behaviors and behavior tendencies like procrastination, compulsiveness, avoidance, addiction and withdrawal by the means of their irrational and self-defeating thinking, emoting and behaving. REBT is then applied as an educational process in which the therapist often active-directively teaches the client how to identify irrational and self-defeating beliefs and philosophies which in nature are rigid, extreme, unrealistic, illogical and absolutist, and then to forcefully and actively question and dispute them and replace them with more rational and self-helping ones. By using different cognitive, emotive and behavioral methods and activities, the client, together with help from the therapist and in homework exercises, can gain a more rational, self-helping and constructive rational way of thinking, emoting and behaving. One of the main objectives in REBT is to show the client that whenever unpleasant and unfortunate activating events occur in people's lives, they have a choice of making themselves feel healthily and self-helpingly sorry, disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed, or making themselves feel unhealthily and self-defeatingly horrified, terrified, panicked, depressed, self-hating and self-pitying. By attaining and ingraining a more rational and self-constructive philosophy of themselves, others and the world, people often are more likely to behave and emote in more life-serving and adaptive ways.\n\nAlbert Ellis posits three major insights of REBT:\nInsight 1 – People seeing and accepting the reality that their emotional disturbances at point C are only partially caused by the activating events or adversities at point A that precede C. Although A contributes to C, and although disturbed Cs (such as feelings of panic and depression) are much more likely to follow strong negative As (such as being assaulted or raped), than they are to follow weak As (such as being disliked by a stranger), the main or more direct cores of extreme and dysfunctional emotional disturbances (Cs) are people’s irrational beliefs — the \"absolutistic\" (inflexible) \"musts\" and their accompanying inferences and attributions that people strongly believe about the activating event.\n\nInsight 2 – No matter how, when, and why people acquire self-defeating or irrational beliefs (i.e. beliefs that are the main cause of their dysfunctional emotional-behavioral consequences), if they are disturbed in the present, they tend to keep holding these irrational beliefs and continue upsetting themselves with these thoughts. They do so not because they held them in the past, but because they still actively hold them in the present (often unconsciously), while continuing to reaffirm their beliefs and act as if they are still valid. In their minds and hearts, the troubled people still follow the core \"musturbatory\" philosophies they adopted or invented long ago, or ones they recently accepted or constructed.\n\nInsight 3 – No matter how well they have gained insights 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But it is unlikely that people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that \"there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs\"; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute \"musts\" (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible \"preferences\"; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.\n\nInsight 4 – That in order for point D to occur in ones life often circumstances need to occur or transpire in order for the dispute in ones self and ones own emotions to happen. This way the dispute is reinforced by actions taken by the self if the action is strong enough. However if this is not executed by others with the person in affect not aware of what is going on the situation could become dangerous or life threatening by the person being treated.\nRegarding cognitive-affective-behavioral processes in mental functioning and dysfunctioning, originator Albert Ellis explains:\n\n\"REBT assumes that human thinking, emotion, and action are not really separate or disparate processes, but that they all significantly overlap and are rarely experienced in a pure state. Much of what we call emotion is nothing more nor less than a certain kind — a biased, prejudiced, or strongly evaluative kind — of thought. But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human organisms and seems to work in a kind of closed circuit with a feedback mechanism: First, perception biases response, and then response tends to bias subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent perceptions, and prior responses appear to bias subsequent responses. What we call feelings almost always have a pronounced evaluating or appraisal element.\"\nREBT then generally proposes that many of these self-defeating cognitive, emotive and behavioral tendencies are both innately biological and indoctrinated early in and during life, and further grow stronger as a person continually revisits, clings and acts on them. Ellis alludes to similarities between REBT and the general semantics when explaining the role of irrational beliefs in self-defeating tendencies, citing Alfred Korzybski as a significant modern influence on this thinking.\n\nREBT differs from other clinical approaches like psychoanalysis in that it places little emphasis on exploring the past, but instead focuses on changing the current evaluations and philosophical thinking-emoting and behaving in relation to themselves, others and the conditions under which people live.\n\nOne of the main pillars of REBT is that irrational and dysfunctional ways and patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset. These dysfunctional patterns are examples of cognitive distortions.\n\nAlbert Ellis has suggested three core beliefs or philosophies that humans tend to disturb themselves through:\n\nREBT commonly posits that at the core of irrational beliefs there often are explicit or implicit rigid demands and commands, and that extreme derivatives like awfulizing, frustration intolerance, people deprecation and over-generalizations are accompanied by these. According to REBT the core dysfunctional philosophies in a person's evaluative emotional and behavioral belief system, are also very likely to contribute to unrealistic, arbitrary and crooked inferences and distortions in thinking. REBT therefore first teaches that when people in an insensible and devout way overuse absolutistic, dogmatic and rigid \"shoulds\", \"musts\", and \"oughts\", they tend to disturb and upset themselves.\n\nFurther REBT generally posits that disturbed evaluations to a large degree occur through over-generalization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or behaviors. For example, awfulizing is partly mental magnification of the importance of an unwanted situation to a catastrophe or horror, elevating the rating of something from bad to worse than it should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a \"holocaust\". The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and axiomatically defined by their perceived flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one's ability to cope with them.\n\nEssential to REBT theory is also the concept of secondary disturbances which people sometimes construct on top of their primary disturbance. As Ellis emphasizes:\n\n\"Because of their self-consciousness and their ability to think about their thinking, they can very easily disturb themselves about their disturbances and can also disturb themselves about their ineffective attempts to overcome their emotional disturbances.\"\nAs would be expected, REBT argues that mental wellness and mental health to a large degree results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving. When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, likely to be more healthy, constructive and functional. This does not by any means mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.\n\nREBT clearly acknowledges that people, in addition to disturbing themselves, also are innately constructivists. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a multimodal manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.\n\nREBT generally teaches and promotes:\n\nAs explained, REBT is a therapeutic system of both theory and practice; generally one of the goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to \"un-upset\" themselves and then how to empower themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives. The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.\n\nIn traditional REBT, the client together with the therapist, in a structured active-directive manner, often work through a set of target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are assessed in regards to the client's values and goals. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client's different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that might account for a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors. Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.\n\nIn therapy, the first step often is that the client acknowledges the problems, accepts emotional responsibility for these and has willingness and determination to change. This normally requires a considerable amount of insight, but as originator Albert Ellis explains:\n\n\"Humans, unlike just about all the other animals on earth, create fairly sophisticated languages which not only enable them to think about their feeling, their actions, and the results they get from doing and not doing certain things, but they also are able to think about their thinking and even think about thinking about their thinking.\"\nThrough the therapeutic process, REBT employs a wide array of forceful and active, meaning multimodal and disputing, methodologies. Central through these methods and techniques is the intent to help the client challenge, dispute and question their destructive and self-defeating cognitions, emotions and behaviors. The methods and techniques incorporate cognitive-philosophic, emotive-evocative-dramatic, and behavioral methods for disputation of the client's irrational and self-defeating constructs and helps the client come up with more rational and self-constructive ones. REBT seeks to acknowledge that understanding and insight are not enough; in order for clients to significantly change, they need to pinpoint their irrational and self-defeating constructs and work forcefully and actively at changing them to more functional and self-helping ones.\n\nREBT posits that the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this normally includes a wide array of homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The assignments may for example include desensitization tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to help himself through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful collaboration between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client's philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, and his or her life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live a more self-fulfilling and happier life.\n\nREBT and CBT in general have a substantial and strong research base to verify and support both their psychotherapeutic efficiency and their theoretical underpinnings. A great quantity of scientific empirical studies has proven REBT to be an effective and efficient treatment for many kinds of psychopathology, conditions and problems. A vast amount of outcome and experimental studies support the effectiveness of REBT and CBT. Recently, REBT randomized clinical trials have offered a positive view on the efficacy of REBT.\n\nIn general REBT is arguably one of the most investigated theories in the field of psychotherapy and a large amount of clinical experience and a substantial body of modern psychological research have validated and substantiated many of REBTs theoretical assumptions on personality and psychotherapy.\n\nThe clinical research on REBT has been criticized both from within and by others. For instance, originator Albert Ellis has on occasions emphasized the difficulty and complexity of measuring psychotherapeutic effectiveness, because many studies only tend to measure whether clients merely feel better after therapy instead of them getting better and staying better. Ellis has also criticized studies for having limited focus primarily to cognitive restructuring aspects, as opposed to the combination of cognitive, emotive and behavioral aspects of REBT. As REBT has been subject to criticisms during its existence, especially in its early years, REBT theorists have a long history of publishing and addressing those concerns. It has also been argued by Ellis and by other clinicians that REBT theory on numerous occasions has been misunderstood and misconstrued both in research and in general.\n\nSome have criticized REBT for being harsh, formulaic and failing to address deep underlying problems. REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working on the basis of the client’s point of reference. They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions. Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined. REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds. In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.\n\nEllis has himself in very direct terms criticized opposing approaches such as psychoanalysis, transpersonal psychology and abreactive psychotherapies in addition to on several occasions questioning some of the doctrines in certain religious systems, spiritualism and mysticism. Many, including REBT practitioners, have warned against dogmatizing and sanctifying REBT as a supposedly perfect psychological panacea. Prominent REBTers have promoted the importance of high quality and programmatic research, including originator Ellis, a self-proclaimed \"passionate skeptic\". He has on many occasions been open to challenges and acknowledged errors and inefficiencies in his approach and concurrently revised his theories and practices. In general, with regard to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies' interventions, others have pointed out that as about 30–40% of people are still unresponsive to interventions, that REBT could be a platform of reinvigorating empirical studies on the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral models of psychopathology and human functioning.\n\nREBT has been developed, revised and augmented through the years as understanding and knowledge of psychology and psychotherapy have progressed. This includes its theoretical concepts, practices and methodology. The teaching of scientific thinking, reasonableness and un-dogmatism has been inherent in REBT as an approach, and these ways of thinking are an inextricable part of REBT's empirical and skeptical nature.\n\nApplications and interfaces of REBT are used with a broad range of clinical problems in traditional psychotherapeutic settings such as individual-, group- and family therapy. It is used as a general treatment for a vast number of different conditions and psychological problems normally associated with psychotherapy.\n\nIn addition, REBT is used with non-clinical problems and problems of living through counselling, consultation and coaching settings dealing with problems including relationships, social skills, career changes, stress management, assertiveness training, grief, problems with aging, money, weight control etc.\n\nREBT also has many interfaces and applications through self-help resources, phone and internet counseling, workshops & seminars, workplace and educational programmes, etc. This includes Rational Emotive Education (REE) where REBT is applied in education settings, Rational Effectiveness Training in business and work-settings and SMART Recovery (Self Management And Recovery Training) in supporting those in addiction recovery, in addition to a wide variety of specialized treatment strategies and applications.\n\n"}

Originally called 1st Isle of Man, they renamed the group because other contingents had become active. The Scouts' scarf and name tag are in red and white reflecting the close relations to the Air Scouts that they were originally.\n\nThe Isle of Man has attracted Irish Scouts. This was particularly the case under the patronage of Sir Charles Kerruish who facilitated the use of his own lands for Scout camping. Many groups fostered personal friendships with the Speaker of the House of Keys. In fact in 1979, as part of the island's celebration of the 1,000th anniversary of Tynwald, Sir Charles invited Irish Scouts to form part of the guard of honour for the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II. All uniformed personnel present, including the Irish guests received a specially minted medal from the Queen. It was seen a great honour that, on arguably the largest celebration ever on the island, the close link with Irish Scouting was emphasised, as they stood side by side with Manx Scouts and the large military presence who were there to honour both the island itself and the Lord of Mann.\n\nIn 2007 ten Manx Scouts and a Leader attended the 21st World Scout Jamboree as part of the Cumbria and Isle of Man Unit.\n\nIn 2011 nine Manx Scout and a Leader attended the 22nd World Scout Jamboree as part of the contingent with Scouts from Cheshire.\n\nIn 2015 three Scouts and one Leader attended the 23rd World Scout Jamboree in Japan as part of an Isle of Man/Merseyside contingent.\n\nIn 2019 the World Scout Jamboree will be hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico.

In order to avoid the ongoing and potential impacts of climate change, mitigation technologies have been developed in order to adapt to the issue, each invention belonging to one of four specific groups of effort. These groups include energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy (RE), nuclear power/energy (NE), and carbon capture storage (CCS). However, concerns regarding mitigating and adapting to climate change commonly have a priority focus on the groups of carbon capture storage and renewable energy efforts.\n\nTraditionally, areas of western civilization around the world have the resources and finances to successfully develop and maintain technological mitigators to climate change. The research and development of these technologies require funding and incur high costs. There is a global inconsistency in producing these inventions, leaving developing countries without the means to defend themselves against the issue of climate change. Ironically, some of these areas are powerless enough while being the most inflicted by climate change in the world.\n\nClimate change was mentioned as early as 1896 by Swedish chemist, Svante Arrhenius. The topic did not emerge as a political issue until the 1950s. Public policy is its own actor in the business of climate innovations through its control over the activity of emitting and reducing pollution inventions. Predominantly, legislature works to control the innovations particularly through placing restrictions on the amount of pollution that can be produced, and time crunches on when certain changes by companies using polluting inventions need to be completed by. It is up to the state that is implementing policy and the pollution-contributing businesses to work towards the implemented legal requirements in order to reach environmental goals by a set date.\n\nThe beginning of the era to protect the environment started with common law, founded in the law of nuisance. This introduction solely allowed for the action of private work to improve land when harmed (including removing the smell from pig stys, fixing broken dams, and enforcing strict liability). Any other enforcement was stringent to only deal with any major environmental threats, only being able to adequately protect the common resources. Profound regulation to protect the environment was first seen from England law, triggered by environmentally damaging events. Catastrophes such as the \"Great Stink\" (the dumping of sewage in a River Thames by parliament) ignited a movement in protective legislature to establish the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848. As well, the \"Great Smog\" (a massive buildup of air pollution) promoted the development of England’s Clean Air Act 1956. The environmental regulations imposed limitations on the amount of emissions from household and business establishments that can be produced, and inspectorate forces to ensure compliance. “Environmental law” only became a distinct and separate body of legislature in all developed and many developing nations in the 1960s, upon the recognition that the natural environment is in desperate need of aid to sustain itself, being so fragile.\n\nWhile state regulations are in place to reduce emissions in effort to protect the environment’s air quality, international initiatives have worked towards addressing the broader issues. For instance, the many chemicals that harm the ozone layer have been globally restricted to emit through the development of programs that focus on the trading of emissions (a focus reducing acid rain or adapting to climate change). The programs also collaborate to identify and categorize air pollutants and state the acceptable level of emissions and necessary mitigation technologies.\n\nWater quality is also a prominent topic with the concern of improving the environment, as the factor has a direct and immediate impact on the life around it. State regulations per nation implement policies regarding sewage treatment and disposal, as well as managing all agricultural and industrial wastewater. Legislatures also work to control the level of surface runoff that comes from construction sites in predominantly urban environments. Additionally, international efforts also look to identify and categorize water pollutants and state the acceptable concentration levels in water resources.\n\nMoreover, policies are able to manage municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, and nuclear waste, among many other types through governance of its transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal. In terms of containment clearance (of sediment, soil, surface, and ground water), there are policies that work as a protective, rather than preventative measure. They are administered through response actions that are vital to repairing damaged media of the environment. Not only are policies needed for improvements, but as well the effort by people to undertake responsibility or pay for it. Governed actions include emergency response services, liability allocation, assessing the site, remedial investigation and action, feasibility studies, site reuse, and post-remedial monitoring.\n\nFinally, laws that govern man-made chemical safety from modern industrial application include the management of human activities. These policies strictly work to ban some chemical pollutants (particularly in consumer products, such as Bisphenol A material in plastic bottles) and regulate pesticides.\n\nTechnological change and scientific processes play an important role through research, inspiring the creation, distribution and exploitation of knowledge. These scientific advances improve technological innovation for climate change mitigation. They are vital to use in strategizing methods to adaptation, being necessary while climate change threatens the world. Presently national technology systems focus on growth in jobs and output, instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing energy efficiency. Adaptation strategies are meant to reduce any vulnerability of available technologies and the need for adaptation at all with scientific technologies including energy efficiency improvements, and production of renewable energy (RE), nuclear power/energy (NE), and carbon capture storage (CCS).\n\nEnergy efficiency is a concept used to define the focus of tackling climate change by creating energy efficient technologies and products (they are meant to use less energy to provide the same service). Energy efficiency is an important tool for climate adaptation because it preserves and extends resources in the long-run. It also minimizes the costs for the state in adapting the energy sector for climate change. The least costly way to meet the increased demand for energy is by saving energy. However, developing countries struggle with the trade-off between energy efficiency and economic performance in keeping up with their expanding economies, since they require large increases in energy production and consumption. Improving energy efficiency does not only include the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It varies and depends on the energy being supplied for the particular technology, such as fossil fuels from a coal-fired plant that produces gasoline for cars. Improved efficiency will cut emissions for fossil fueled technologies compared to low carbon sources, such as electricity which is produced from renewable energy. Nonetheless, improving energy efficiency is a key tool for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and most low carbon sources (which includes renewable energy and carbon capture storage).\n\nRenewable energy is generated from natural resources, such as sunlight, wind, and rain. Renewable technologies function from resources that vary from solar power, wind power, to hydroelectricity and are constantly renewed. Renewable energy technologies have an advantage over conventional energy systems, as they have a much lower impact on the environment and are considered a clean source of energy. A disadvantage to using renewable energy includes the source’s unstable market, with uncertain profitability from the competition of fossil fuels. The energy source therefore is not in a likely position to gain much support from the state and private sector. Renewable sources are being encouraged to address the issues and challenges that arise from greenhouse gas inflictions. Most renewable energy technologies are generated from sunlight, which creates solar energy (power). This solar energy is the most efficient renewable resource on the planet, predominantly generating electricity but also sourcing power for the purposes of heating and water purification. Solar energy is conducted using heat from the sun, which is absorbed by wind turbines, in capturing wind that generates wind power. The use of solar renewable technologies plays a large roll in emission reduction for mitigating climate change, reducing air pollution and addressing concerns with energy security.\n\nNuclear power is conducted by the released nuclear energy from nuclear reactions. The power is ignited heat from reactions, which is most commonly used in the powering of electricity-producing steam turbines, located in nuclear power plants. Nuclear fission is a type of nuclear reaction that is a leading form of low carbon power generation. The commercialization of entire power stations was first introduced in the 1970s. Entire power stations that are run by fission-electricity are known to have emission values that are lower than that of renewable energy stations in terms of a greenhouse gas emissions per cycle (of a generated unit of energy). The median value of all commercial sources for baseload energy is lowest for this method and second to lowest for all technologies of commercial electricity. The first establishments of these plants prevented 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, emitted by the thermal power stations that burn fossil fuels. Nuclear power is acclaimed by the World Nuclear Association and Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy to be the safe and sustainable energy source in reducing carbon emissions. Retrospectively, the corporations of Greenpeace International and NIRS are known to be opposed to nuclear power, arguing that it threatens the environment more than anything.\n\nCarbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, and its levels have increased from human activity, promoting incidents such as fossil fuel combustion. One of the main technologies meant for reducing carbon dioxide emissions is carbon capture storage (CCS). This involves the absorption of carbon dioxide to prevent it from entering the atmosphere from emitting sources, such as natural gas processing plants or power plants. Carbon capture storage is a technology that can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions that result from the use of fossil fuels in generating electricity or industrial processes. Fossil fuels impact the environment when combusted in quantities that restrict the ability to stabilize safe levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbon capture storage involves a three-step process of acquiring the carbon dioxide, transporting it, and securely storing it away. First, the technology separates the carbon dioxide from the gases produced in the electricity generation or industrial processes in methods of pre-combustion captures, post combustion capture, or oxy-fuel combustion. Then, the separated carbon dioxide is transported for safe storage via either pipeline or ship. The carbon dioxide is stored carefully in depleted natural gas fields or selected geologic rock formations underground, that are usually located a few kilometres underneath the earth’s surface. The further development of advances in carbon capture technologies means for more success in future capture processes. The main barrier is the cost and efficiency issues of capturing carbon dioxide from power generation.\n\nEconomic factors need to be taken into account when determining the current and expected future improvements of technologies for climate change adaptation. The economic factors, which are described through the supply and demand chain, are important for understanding the rate and direction of the progresses of technological change. The state determines the supply, based on the relevant scientific and technological knowledge and opportunity. As well, the state assesses the costs and availability of resources, such as the trained technicians and experienced workers that are involved in the research processes to create and improve climate change adaptation technologies. Whereas, the demand for innovation depends on the amount of cost reduction from the particular technology being used, as well as the consumer and producer benefit from a new or improved technology for existing goods.\n\nTechnologies for climate change mitigation are meant to create energy efficient products and services that result in economic benefits to its consumers and to the environment. The state can track energy efficiency improvements through the policies that regulate prices in markets.\n\nIn an economic perspective, greenhouse gas emissions are considered ‘externalities’ that are not fully traded and priced in markets, lacking credible market value. Addressing climate change becomes an issue for society and cannot be achieved simply from the progresses of private markets, consumers and producers. Issues such as, directly regulating personal choices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will require the government to outlaw large cars, raise carbon or fossil fuel taxes, and even increase public transit spending. Furthermore, subsidising production and diffusion throughout society is politically less challenging because technological innovation is substantial to economic growth. Energy efficiency improvements directly affect the consumers (i.e. in 2016, the Canadian government helped citizens’ save $12 billion in energy costs in 2013, accumulating an average savings of $869 per household).\n\nFor technological innovation to achieve economic sustainability, an economy would have to ensure responsible and limited use of natural resources that are non-renewable or not harmful to the environment, such as fossil fuels or uranium. A sustainable economy uses various strategies for engaging optimal resources, to achieve a beneficial balance in the long term. Presently, there is technology already existing that can effectively reduce and even stabilize greenhouse gas levels within the next few decades. However, the issue is that it is economically and politically difficult to initiate and install energy efficient products, using renewable energy sources (i.e. wind power). Social and political barriers limit the progress of implementing technologies and meeting the demands of effective climate change mitigation.\n\n\n"}

The language belongs, as yet to be confirmed according to studies and sources, to the southern group of the Pamir languages, in the Iranian group of the Indo-European family (450) of languages, where the different Ishkashmi, Shighni/…nani and Wakhi languages are included. A very rough estimate of the population of Wakhis is 58,000 worldwide. The Wakhi live in six different countries. In the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan, the Wakhi people mainly live in Gojal, Ishkoman, Darkut and in Chitral District's Broghol. They also live in some parts of Wakhan in Afghanistan, Gorno-Badakhshan in Tajikistan, Xinjiang in China, Russia and Turkey\n\nIn the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan, Wakhi is spoken from Putur, near Ishkashim, to the upper reaches of the Wakhan River.\n\nIn Tajikistan the Wakhi and other communities that speak one of the Pamir languages refer to themselves as Pamiri or Badakhshani and there has been a movement to separate their identity from that of the majority Persian-speaking Tajiks. Linguists universally refer to Wakhi as an East Iranian language independent of Tajik Persian, but many Tajik nationalists insist that Wakhi and other Pamir languages are actually dialects of Tajik.\n\nIn Gilgit-Baltistan Wakhi is spoken in the sparsely populated upper portions of five of the northernmost valleys: Hunza (many ethnic Wakhi of this valley now speak Burushaski), Gojal that including the valleys of Chipursan and Shingshal, (Upper-Hunza—mostly intact), Ishkoman (many ethnic Wakhi speak, now, Shina), Yasin (many ethnic Wakhi of this valley speak, now, Khow-wor or Burushaski/Virchik-wor), Gupis (many ethnic Wakhi speak, now, Shina) and Yarkhun (many ethnic Wakhi of this valley now speak Khow-wor). Yarkhun is located in the Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while others are in the Gilgit–Baltistan. Gojal, in the Hunza valley, has the largest Wakhi population of any of the above five areas. The Wakhis of Ishkoman live primarily in the Karambar valley, in the town of Imit and beyond. In Yasin, they live mostly in the vicinity of Darkot, and in Yarhkun, they are found in Baroghil and in a few other small villages in the high, upper portion of valley.\n\nIn Pakistan, the central organization of the Wakhi is the Wakhi Cultural Association Pakistan (WCA), an organization that is registered with the Government of Pakistan and which works with the collaboration of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and Lok Virsa Pakistan. The Association is working for the preservation of the Wakhi language and culture, as well as documenting their poetry and music.\n\nRadio Pakistan Gilgit relays the Wakhi radio programme \"Sadoyah Boomy Dunyo\", the voice of the roof of the world. The Wakhi Cultural Association has arranged more than twenty programmes since 1984, which includes cultural shows, musical nights, and large-scale musical festivals with the collaboration of Lok Virsa Pakistan, the Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan (AKCSP), and Pakistan television. In 2000, the WCA won a \"Best Programme\" organizer award in the Silk Road Festival from the President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf. A computerized codification of the Wakhi script has been released, which will help to promote the language development programme and documentation of Wakhi poetry, literature, and history.\n\nWakhi is also spoken in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, in Xinjiang of China.\n\nThere are approximately 6,000 Wakhi in Russia, Most of them have migrated from Tajikistan and Afghanistan.\n\nThere are some Wakhi villages in Turkey in the eastern regions, where they have migrated from Afghanistan in 1979 during the Afghan and Russian war.\n\nTraditionally Wakhi was not a written language. Writing systems have been developed for the language using Arabic, Cyrillic and Latin scripts.\n\nThis Arabic alphabet is mainly used in Afghanistan:\nWhen Wakhi is written in Cyrillic, the sounds are usually represented by these letters:\nA Latin alphabet was developed in 1984 by Haqiqat Ali:\n\nSample text from a Bible translation published in 2001 is shown below:\n\nThe Wakhi lexicon exhibits significant differences with the other Pamir languages. Gawarjon's comparison of the dialects of Sarikoli and Wakhi spoken in China is reproduced below.\n\n\n\n"}

It is Cushitic, but its position within that family is unclear. Speakers are all older adults.\n\nThe Yaaku people are former hunter-gatherers and bee-keepers. They adopted the pastoralist culture of the Maasai in the first half of the twentieth century, although some still keep bees. As a result, the Yaaku almost completely gave up their language for the Maa language of the dominant Maasai tribe (including the Samburu) between 1925 and 1936. The variety of Maa they speak is called \"Mukogodo-Maasai\". Old Yaaku words are still found in bee-keeping vocabulary, for example:\n\nA language-revival movement has started among the Yaaku in recent years, aiming to strengthen the Yaaku identity. In early 2005, Maarten Mous, Hans Stoks and Matthijs Blonk visited Doldol on the invitation of a special Yaaku committee, to determine whether there is enough knowledge of Yaaku left among the people to revive the language. This visit has shown there are few truly fluent Yaaku speakers left, all very old: two women called Roteti and Yaponay, respectively, and a man called Legunai. The latter two are both of the \"Terito\" age set, which means that they must be around a hundred years old. Knowledge of vocabulary is much wider spread in the community. Full language revival is improbable because of the scarcity of fluent speakers, but one of the possibilities for a partial revival is to use Yaaku vocabulary in the framework of Maa grammar, a strategy that is analogous to the making of Mbugu, a mixed language of the Usambara mountains in Tanzania.\n\n\n"}
