The majority are Shia Muslims, while a minority, concentrated in the coastal areas, are Sunni Muslims.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Ahwazi Arabs face discrimination by the authorities concerning politics, employment and cultural rights, whereas Iran completely rejects such accusations, and considers such charges as exaggeration. There has also been many arrests of Ahwazi Arabs who have converted to Sunni Islam, which is considered a crime in Iran according to the British daily newspaper \"The Guardian\"., meanwhile, according to Islamic Republic of Iran, there is not such crime/penalty in its law for converting to Sunni.\n\nThe rise in conversion to Sunni Islam is partly a result of anti-Arab racism, the perceived crackdown on the Arab identity of the region and the view that Sunni Islam is closer to the Arab roots of the Ahwazi Arabs. According to the \"International Campaign for Sunni Prisoners in Iran\" (ICSPI), the crackdown is due to the Iranian government's alarm at \"the rise of Sunni Islam among the Ahwazi Arabs in the traditionally Shia-majority Khuzestan province.\" As a result of these conversions, Sunni Arabs across the Middle East have increasingly shown support for the Ahwazi cause.\n\n"}

It was nominated for a Philip K. Dick Award, a \"Locus\" Award and a Lambda Literary Award.\n\nIn the future, control of the preservation of interplanetary natural resources has been given over to ecological artificial intelligences called the Governors, who enforce carbon neutrality with strict population controls and energy consumption regulations, and even calculated genocide called \"assessment\". The parliament of the fascistic Old Earth Colonial Coalition, ruthless in its own support of the AIs, serves as a buffer to prevent unnecessary disruption to humanity. With colonists having left Earth generations before seeking freedom from these restrictions, the Coalition has now, for decades, been subsuming autonomous worlds back under its control. One of these is New Amazonia, a lush planet on which a matriarchal, primarily lesbian society has risen up amidst abandoned alien technology that includes a seemingly inexhaustible power supply. The Amazonian women are aggressive and warlike, but also pragmatic and defensive of their freedom from the male-dominated Coalition that seeks to conquer them. Distrustful of male aggression, they subjugate their men, a minority they seem to tolerate solely for reproduction and labor.\n\nA diplomatic mission to the matriarchal planet New Amazonia reunites ex-lovers Vincent Katherinessen and Michelangelo Kusanagi-Jones after a separation of 17 years. Arriving in the capital city of Penthesilea, the men are ostensibly repatriating looted artwork, but in truth the ambassador-spies have been tasked with obtaining the Amazonians' secret energy technology by any means necessary, and doing what they can to facilitate a Coalition conquest. However, both Vincent (a master of observation) and Angelo (a trained liar and fighter) each have hidden plans to undermine their own mission. Meanwhile, multiple factions among the Amazonians are engaged in covert political intrigues rooted in the gender dynamics of their society.\n\n\nAnnalee Newitz of io9 explained that, faced with strict population controls, the Earth-centric humans in \"Carnival\" have become obsessed with reproduction, and have outlawed homosexuality as directly opposing this function. She wrote that \"Bear's idea that an eco-regime like this would breed conservatism rather than progressivism is really quite smart\", and praised the author's \"careful attention to how ideologies might evolve over time\". Paul Kincaid of \"SF Site\" noted that Vincent and Michelangelo \"are homosexuals from a world whose regressive and repressive mores mean that this could get them killed, but for the fact that they are exceptionally well-skilled at their job and also well-practiced in deception\". Of the New Amazonian civilization, Newitz wrote:\n\nExplaining that the Amazonian women subjugate their men as a means to diffuse the potential of male aggression, Kincaid compared the matriarchal premise to \"the feminist science fiction of twenty or perhaps thirty years ago\". Joe Tokamak of \"The Internet Review of Science Fiction\" called the novel \"a fantasy of societal alternatives reminiscent of the sixties or seventies\" and yet \"fresh, sophisticated material\". He also noted how Bear's contrast of the societal differences between the New Amazonians and their visitors initiates conflict that evolves as the characters interact.\n\nIn 2007, \"Carnival\" was nominated for a Philip K. Dick Award, a \"Locus\" Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and a Lambda Literary Award for LGBT Science Fiction/Fantasy/Horror.\n\nNewitz wrote that the novel \"manages to do what so few SF novels can ... it offers an intriguing, intellectually-rewarding glimpse at one human possible future while also telling a rip-roaring yarn.\" Liz Bourke of \"Tor.com\" called it \"a vivid book, vital and alive\", and cited it as her favorite of Bear's science fiction novels. Kincaid wrote, \"Strip away the sexual politics overlaid on the story, which add complexity to the plot but not necessarily depth to the novel, and this is a book that could have come straight from the so-called golden age.\" Though suggesting that \"there are too many layers of betrayal and deception for a book of this length\", Kincaid wrote that \"Bear keeps the whole thing moving at a brisk and satisfying pace ... this is exactly the sort of vivid, pacy novel that used to make science fiction such an exciting genre to read.\" Writing for \"SF Crowsnest\", Tomas L. Martin called the characters \"interesting and very dynamic\", the galactic politics \"top-notch\" and some of the technology \"breathtaking\", while noting that the novel occasionally \"gets a little bogged down and hard to navigate\". Tokamak praised the \"intriguing, three dimensional characters\" and the \"compelling and complex plot that gradually gets its hooks into the reader and doesn't let go\", while calling the resolution \"hasty and disconnected from all the misery the characters go through to get there\".\n"}

Coffee culture has a long history, dating back to the Ottoman period. The distinct type of coffeehouse in former Yugoslavia is the \"kafana\", and the traditional form is \"Turkish coffee\" (unfiltered).\n\nSerbs were influenced by Ottoman culture following the Ottoman conquest, and as early as the 16th century, a coffeehouse was in business in Dorćol, a trading centre in Belgrade at that time. During this period, coffee was served in caravanserai and meyhane. The businesses in Belgrade began to be called \"kafane\" (s. \"kafana\") after 1739, when the Ottomans regained Serbia from Austria. At that time, the most notable kafana was \"Crni orao\" (\"The Black Eagle\") in Dorćol, mentioned by traveller Kepper, who noted that the kafanas were divided by religion. The apogee of number of kafanas in Belgrade was in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe kafana was the common meeting place for consultations over village or zadruga affairs. In the early 20th century, Serb peasant leaders often met in kafanas, while Croat peasants did not, looking at it as an urban practice, and instead of black coffee drank wine. Women were at the time prevented from kafanas by a strong social prohibition.\nIn the 1900s, young Serbian nationalists in Belgrade met in the city's kafanas where they openly discussed hatred for Austro-Hungary, and desire for Yugoslavism. Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, visited those kafanas in 1912. The \"Crni konj\" (\"Black horse\") café in Varoš-kapija quarter was a meeting place for Ottoman Serb refugees and \"pečalbari\" (seasonal workers).\n\nIn the late 1970s, a new type of drinking establishment first appeared in Yugoslavia: the \"caffe bar\" or colloquially \"kafić\". These bars normally serve espresso instead of Turkish coffee, tea and soft drinks, as well as a wide selection of alcoholic beverages, but no food. Caffe bars are found in all cities, most shopping centers and at larger gas stations. They have become an essential part of social life as a meeting place for people of all ages, including families with children. University students are among the most frequent patrons of caffe bars. Many people come to caffe bars to smoke cigarettes, which is generally allowed, even indoors.\n\nIn big cities, seaside towns and other places visited by tourists, caffe bars have large outdoor seating areas, as well as television screens, mainly for watching live sports. Larger caffe bars are sometimes also nightclubs, featuring performances by popular local musicians, often in the turbo folk genre.\n\nKafanas continue to operate, especially in Serbia, as a type of restaurant specializing in traditional cuisine and also serving alcohol and coffee. Traditional kafanas and modern caffe bars are separate types of establishment.\n\n\n\nIn pre-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, coffee drinking was one of the traditional forms of inter-ethnic bonding. After the Bosnian War, inter-ethnic coffee drinking is a rare practice, \"having a coffee with someone from the other side would therefore signal one's readiness to challenge the post-conflict divisions\".\n"}

The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters' defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the CIO's (CIO) expulsion of unions in which the party held the most influence in 1950.\n\nHistorians disagree why the American union movement never formed a labor party and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in any numbers. Some have argued that a strain of American exceptionalism made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized class struggle; others have contended that downplaying political and social agendas for the sake of unity, short-term gains and building strong unions was at the cost of a potential labor party. Others contend instead that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by what commenters charged were 'ideological zig-zags'. The CP's history within the labor movement support parts of all of these theses.\n\nAfter playing a leading role in the United Automobile Workers's (UAW) victories in Flint against General Motors Corporation and against Chrysler Corporation in 1937, the CP found itself under sharp attack from its opponents within the UAW. Homer Martin, first president of the UAW, sought to drive out all of the left activists within the UAW in order to eliminate any rival contenders for power. Martin brought in Jay Lovestone, former executive secretary of the CP before his expulsion in 1929, as his advisor and installed Lovestone supporters in key positions throughout the union.\n\nMartin only succeeded, however, in bringing about his own downfall. After he failed to persuade the UAW Convention in 1937 to give him authority to fire organizers and eliminate local union newspapers, Martin set out to expel his rivals. After firing or transferring a number of CP members who had played prominent roles in the Flint sit-down strike, Martin first suspended, then expelled, Mortimer and his other opponents on the UAW's Executive Board. The CIO leadership, alarmed by the possibility that sectarian infighting might destroy the UAW, forced Martin to reinstate the Executive Board members. When the reconstituted Executive Board ordered Martin to sever his ties with Lovestone and to submit all his public announcements to it for its approval, he attempted to suspend the majority of the Board, including both his opponents associated with the CP, such as Mortimer, their allies, such as Richard Frankensteen, and the UAW leaders associated with the Socialist Party, such as Walter Reuther.\n\nThat nearly split the UAW. After skirmishes at the UAW headquarters and some local unions, the expelled Executive Board members, with the support of the CIO, regained control in 1939 and expelled Martin. He left with about 20,000 members to form his own union, which affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Lovestone left with him.\n\nThe CP was in a particularly strong position at that point: it was the leading player in the Left-Center coalition that had defeated Martin and would have been able to elect George Addes, a close ally of the Party, as President of the UAW if it had pressed the point. But that would have required that the Party defy Sidney Hillman, head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the most powerful force within the CIO after Lewis, and Philip Murray, Lewis' protégé and head of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, who came to the convention to demand the selection of R.J. Thomas, an apolitical Board member who had, until recently, supported Martin, as its candidate to end the factional fighting within the UAW.\n\nAccording to some reports, when Hillman and Murray could not bring Mortimer and his supporters around, Earl Browder, Chairman of the Communist Party of the USA (CPUSA), came to Cleveland to demand that they support Thomas. Eager not to appear as sectarians and thus endanger their role within the CIO at large, the CP leadership had the Communists within the UAW support Thomas and also permit the elimination of the Vice-President positions that they had held. At the same time, the CP began dissolving its factions within the UAW and dropping its shop papers as it aligned itself even more closely with the New Deal. In the name of labor unity, the CP undertook a tactical retreat.\n\nThe CP's conciliatory stance did not, however, protect it from its other factional rivals within the UAW. The working alliance between the CP and the Socialists in the UAW had broken down in 1938 over differences over the CP's support for \"collective security,\" an alliance of the Soviet Union with the non-fascist nations of the West against Hitler. The Socialist Party, at that time even further left than the CP on many issues, organized a separate caucus within the Executive Board that, from that point forward, opposed the CP and its alliance partners.\n\nThe CP made it easier for its opponents by making a number of sudden and shocking changes in policy. After the Hitler-Stalin pact, the CP campaigned vigorously against any U.S. involvement in the war against fascism; a journalist with the CP's Weekly Worker newspaper coined the slogan \"The Yanks Ain't Coming\" to sum up the Party's position. What is more, the CP now repudiated its Popular Front strategies of the previous four years, attacking President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration's efforts to support France and Britain against Germany as a campaign to lead the U.S. into an imperialist war. The federal government responded by arresting Earl Browder and a number of other CP leaders.\n\nThe CP's opponents within the labor movement capitalized on the Party's break with FDR to attack it. James Carey, the president of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (or UE) who had worked closely with Communist UE officials in the past, now distanced himself from them over their opposition to a third term for Roosevelt. The UAW passed several resolutions condemning both Nazis and Communists at its Conventions.\n\nAt the same time that their break with Roosevelt isolated them within the CIO, opponents of the CP outside the labor movement stepped up their attacks on the loyalty of Party members, accusing them, among other things, of engaging in sabotage by supporting strikes of aircraft workers during the UAW's organizing drive in that industry. While some of these accusations, such as those made by the Dies Committee or Reader's Digest, were so wide of the mark as to discredit the accusers, the tide of unfavorable publicity made any association with the CP that much riskier.\n\nThe CP also lost ground within the CIO. While the CP believed it could shelter itself within the CIO by continuing to loyally support Lewis, who also opposed a third term for Roosevelt, that reliance on Lewis was misplaced. Lewis was prepared both to use the CP and to get rid of CP members when they no longer served his purposes, as demonstrated by the activities of his lieutenant, Adolph Germer, who actively undercut the CP leadership within the International Woodworkers of America when sent to assist it in organizing lumber workers in the Northwest in 1940. At the same time Lewis abolished the position of west coast director of the CIO, which Harry Bridges had held, limiting his authority to California.\n\nWhatever protection the CP could have hoped to receive from Lewis evaporated in any event in 1940, when Lewis abruptly resigned from his position as President of the CIO following his baffling decision to support Wendell Willkie over Roosevelt for President that year. Philip Murray, Lewis' successor as head of the CIO, was determined to stop the spread of the CP's influence in the CIO and to demonstrate to the public at large that the CIO was not controlled by the CP. To that end he insisted on a resolution at the CIO's 1940 conference that condemned Communism, along with Nazism and fascism, as \"inimical to the welfare of labor.\" Lee Pressman, the most highly placed CP ally within the CIO, presented the resolution in his role as secretary of the resolutions committee.\n\nMurray did not, however, insist on banning Communists from the CIO; on the contrary, he had no desire to provoke a public fight over the CP's politics or CP members' role within either the CIO or its affiliates. This suited the Party, which likewise did not want to risk a showdown that could possibly result in either their expulsion or split the CIO. So while internal political disputes kept the battles raging within unions such as the UAW, the UE and the IWA, the CP agreed to a compromise that forced them to accept the label of \"totalitarian,\" but allowed them to maintain their positions within the CIO itself.\n\nCommunist influence in labor unions was seen by the Roosevelt administration as a serious threat to US military preparedness. As the US military built up in 1940 and 1941, US Secretary of War Henry Stimson was convinced that labor strikes and slowdowns at key facilities were due to the CPUSA’s efforts to block Franklin Roosevelt’s military preparedness policy. Strikes at Harville Die-Casting Company, Alcoa, and North American Aviation were widely seen within the Roosevelt administration as communist-inspired for ideological reasons, rather than for better wages and working conditions. The most important strike seen as communist-inspired was at the Allis-Chalmers aircraft plant in Los Angeles on 5 June 1941. The plant built bombers for the U. S. and British governments, and the strike was seen as a serious threat to American aid to the Allies. The federal government seized the plant and army troops forced open paths through the picket lines to allow workers to enter the plant. \n\nThe CP's policy toward President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and war changed as soon as Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. At that point, the CP changed into unqualified supporters for the war effort. For their labor allies, that meant not only unconditional support for a wartime no-strike pledge - which the rest of the labor movement had endorsed to some degree - but also opposition to anything that would compromise anti-fascist unity at home. The CP's opponents within the labor movement would also use CP's sudden change against them in the factional battles of the years to come.\n\nThe change in CP policy led to some startlingly inconsistent positions on its part. When A. Philip Randolph, President of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the foremost African-American unionist of the time, urged a march on Washington in 1941 to underscore black workers' demands for the elimination of job discrimination in war industries, the CP attacked him relentlessly. This is more than ironic: the CP had championed black workers' rights in the past, even when it complicated their efforts to organize textile workers or miners in the South.\n\nThe Party had, however, strong political differences with Randolph, even before it became a supporter of the war: he had resigned as head of the National Negro Congress and denounced the CP when the CP broke with the Roosevelt Administration. When Hitler attacked the Soviet Union it continued to attack Randolph's proposed March, but now on the ground that it undermined the unity needed to win the war. The CP did not, on the other hand, abandon its support for civil rights, supporting the creation of the Fair Employment Practices Committee and fighting for equal treatment of black workers in the unions in which they had a presence. These battles were particularly fierce within the UAW, many of whose white members had engaged in hate strikes to protest either the hiring or promotion of black workers in their plants and who had engaged in the massive race riots in Detroit in 1943.\n\nThat battle inevitably became part of the larger battle between the Addes and Frankensteen group within the UAW, which the CP supported, and the Walter Reuther-led opposition. While each faction supported creation of a 'minority department' within the UAW to deal with the special needs of black and other minority workers and the education of UAW members generally, they disagreed over whether the head of that department should always be African-American. In the end, the 1943 UAW Convention defeated both sides' proposals on a voice vote after a heated debate in which many delegates opposed taking any stand on civil rights as being outside the union's economic sphere.\n\nThe CP was more vocal and consistent in supporting the wartime no-strike pledge - a position that ultimately cost it much support within the labor movement. The CIO and the AFL each supported the pledge in general, particularly after the furor strikes in the aircraft industry and at Allis-Chalmers Company had provoked in the years immediately before the United States' entry into the war. But the CP and its allies now embraced the pledge with such fervor, at the expense of traditional union principles some said, that it made the Party's commitment to unionism suspect. Harry Bridges of the International Longshore Workers Union (ILWU) called for a speedup of the pace of work - which may not have been inconsistent with the union's goal of controlling the way that work was done on the docks - but certainly sounded strange coming from the union that had previous relentlessly fought employers on the issue. Bridges, Joseph Curran of the NMU and Julius Emspak of the UE even supported a proposal by Roosevelt in 1944 to militarize some civilian workplaces, but retreated when the rest of the CIO executive board reacted furiously against it.\n\nThe CP also supported piecework systems in the electrical and automobile industries, which it defended as both necessary to boost production and a way to improve workers' earnings under the wartime wage control systems imposed by the War Labor Board, but which were still anathema, particularly to unionists in mass production industries such as automobile manufacturing. Walter Reuther used this issue to great effect against the CP and its allies at the UAW's 1943 Convention, where his slate fell just short of defeating Addes and Frankensteen.\n\nOn the other hand, the CP mended fences with Sidney Hillman and others within the CIO leadership by coming out strongly in support of Roosevelt for the duration of the war and working diligently in the CIO's political efforts. The Party also grew tremendously during the war years and even took the step, in the wake of the formal alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union, to formally dissolve itself, or at least rename itself as the Communist Political Association in 1944.\n\nThat attempt to submerge itself in the broader coalition to support Roosevelt and the Soviet Union probably did more to damage the Party's standing with many of its most reliable supporters than to make it look safe or respectable to people outside the Party. The Comintern changed direction a year later, when it ejected Browder from the Party, reestablished the CPUSA and installed Foster as its Chairman. More money less work.\n\nThe CP suffered a series of setbacks in the immediate postwar era. The most serious was their complete rout in the UAW, where Walter Reuther's slate finally triumphed in 1947 after years of inconclusive struggles with the Addes and Frankensteen faction. Reuther subsequently drove all of his principal CP adversaries out of the UAW, using one of the provisions of the newly enacted Taft-Hartley Act to complete the process.\n\nIn 1946 the Republican Party took control of both the House and Senate. That Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which, among other things, required all union officers to sign an affidavit that they were not Communists in order for the union to bring a case before the NLRB. Reuther had three of the CP-leaning leaders of UAW Local 248 in Milwaukee - one of the CP's bastions and including some of Reuther's bitterest enemies - expelled for their refusal to sign the oath.\n\nThe CIO itself was slower to join the purge. Persons associated with the CP did, in fact, exercise a good deal of influence in a number of CIO unions in the 1940s, both in the leadership of unions such as the ILWU, UE, Transport Workers Union of America and Fur and Leather Workers and in staff positions in a number of other unions. Those persons had an uneasy relationship with Murray while he headed the CIO. He mistrusted the radicalism of some of their positions and was innately far more sympathetic to anti-Communist organizations such as the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists. He also believed, however, that making anti-Communism a crusade would only strengthen labor's enemies and the rival AFL at a time when labor unity was most important.\n\nMurray might have let the status quo continue, even while Reuther and others within the CIO attacked Communists in their unions, if the CPUSA had not chosen to back Henry A. Wallace's third party campaign for President in 1948. That, and an increasingly bitter division over whether the CIO should support the Marshall Plan, brought Murray to the conclusion that peaceful co-existence with Communists within the CIO was impossible.\n\nMurray began by removing Bridges from his position as the California Regional Director for the CIO and firing Lee Pressman as General Counsel of both the Steelworkers and the CIO. Anti-communist unionists then took the battle to the City and State Councils, where they attempted to oust Communist leaders who did not support the CIO's position on the Marshall Plan and Wallace. A number of former allies or members of the Party, including Mike Quill of the Transport Workers and Joseph Curran of the National Maritime Union, severed their ties with the CP and fired the CP members on their staffs during this time.\n\nAfter the 1948 election, the CIO took the fight one step further in 1950, expelling the ILWU, the Mine, Mill & Smelter Workers Union, the Farm Equipment Union, the Food and Tobacco Workers, and the Fur and Leather Workers, while creating a new union, the International Union of Electrical Workers, to replace the UE, which left the CIO rather than purge its leadership. The CP, which once held positions of influence at every level within the CIO and many of its affiliates, was now driven out of the CIO.\n\nThe CP has, for all effects and purposes, no presence in or influence on the American union movement. Some of the expelled unions, such as the ILWU and UE, survived outside the AFL-CIO, maintaining their political principles, in particular solidarity with labor's struggles around the world and greater rank-and-file control of the union, but have no political relationship with the CP and only marginal influence within the labor movement as a whole. The ILWU has since reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO. Others, such as Mine, Mill, survived; it later merged with its ideological opponent, the Steelworkers, just as the Farm Equipment union eventually was absorbed by the UE. Others, such as the Food and Tobacco Workers, disappeared.\n\nTo the extent that the CP has had any residual effect on the American union movement, after helping to organize some industrial unions, it's only legacy has been its opposition to racial discrimination and its commitment to organizing the lowest-paid workers. \"Old left\" unionists played an important role in organizing hospital workers into District 1199 in New York in the 1950s and 1960s; CP veterans also contributed to the organizing successes of the United Farm Workers. But by the 1950s and 1960s, present and former members of the CPUSA did not advertise their membership or try to use organizing victories to recruit new members. The Party by that time was too weak, membership having declined fairly continuously since early in the Eisenhower (and McCarthy) era.\n\n\n\n"}

Galbraith specifically prepended 'The' to the phrase to emphasize its uniqueness, and sharpened its meaning to narrow it to those commonplace beliefs that are also acceptable and comfortable to society, thus enhancing their ability to resist facts that might diminish them. He repeatedly referred to it throughout the text of \"The Affluent Society\", invoking it to explain the high degree of resistance in academic economics to new ideas. For these reasons, he is usually credited with the invention and popularization of the phrase in modern usage.\n\nConventional wisdom is not necessarily true. It is additionally often seen as an obstacle to the acceptance of newly acquired information, to introducing new theories and explanations, and therefore operates as an obstacle that must be overcome by legitimate revisionism. This is to say, that despite new information to the contrary, conventional wisdom has a property analogous to inertia that opposes the introduction of contrary belief, sometimes to the point of absurd denial of the new information set by persons strongly holding an outdated (conventional) view. This inertia is due to conventional wisdom being made of ideas that are convenient, appealing and deeply assumed by the public, which hangs on to them even as they grow outdated. This inertia can last even after the paradigm has shifted between competing conventional idea sets.\n\nThe concept of conventional wisdom may also be applied or implied in a political sense, being closely related to the phenomenon of talking points. It is used pejoratively to refer to the idea that statements which are repeated over and over become conventional wisdom regardless of whether or not they are true.\n\nIn a more general sense, it is used to refer to the accepted truth about something which nearly no one would argue about, and so is used as a gauge (or well-spring) of normative behavior or belief, even within a professional context. One such example was conventional wisdom in 1950, even among most doctors, was that smoking was not particularly harmful to one's health. Conventional wisdom in 2011: it is. Another: It might be used in this manner discussing a technical matter such as the conventional wisdom was that a man would suffer fatal injuries if he experienced more than eighteen g-forces in an aerospace vehicle. (John Stapp shattered that myth by repeatedly withstanding far more in his research, peaking above 46 Gs).\n\nSometimes, people in society form conventional ideas about what other people in the past considered to be conventional wisdom. For example, take the following sentence: \"It is widely believed that prior to Christopher Columbus people thought the world was flat, but in actuality, scholars of that time had long accepted that the earth is a sphere.\"\n\nThe above sentence is true; people today often think that Columbus discovered the world to be round, when in fact the world's roundness was already widely known by Columbus' time. However, if enough people read and believe the above sentence, the above sentence will eventually supplant the old belief (the old belief in past belief in a flat earth). The above sentence would become the new conventional wisdom. (Ironically, however, this would also turn the above sentence, the new conventional wisdom, into a false claim; because the new conventional wisdom would propose that people are confused about past beliefs in a way that they actually wouldn't be.)\n\nEvidence-based medicine is a deliberate effort to acknowledge expert opinion (conventional wisdom) and how it coexists with scientific data. Evidence-based medicine acknowledges that expert opinion is \"evidence\" and plays a role to fill the \"gap between the kind of knowledge generated by clinical research studies and the kind of knowledge necessary to make the best decision for individual patients.\"\n\n"}

The most basic idea is that problems in the economy such as deindustrialization, environmental decay, outsourcing, industrial incompetence, poverty and addiction to a permanent war economy are based on the \"design\" and \"organization\" of economic institutions. Economic reconstruction builds on the ideas of various institutional economists and thinkers whose work both critiques existing economic institutions and suggests modes of organizing society differently (cf. Veblen, 1998). Economic reconstruction, however, places much more emphasis on the idea of alternative plans and alternative organization.\n\nThe need for reconstruction occurs as fundamental problems plague the contemporary organization of the economic, political, and even \"oppositional\" spheres, such as the contemporary organization of social movements. These spheres each tend to support short term solutions that do not leave in their wake the organization of resources and power in a way that is responsive to citizen needs. Power, democracy and critical alternatives are not linked. In contrast to this state of affairs, economic reconstruction supports the creation of new institutions and the redesign of old ones. The basic idea is to create a new way to organize the economy and society so that institutions work for rather than against peoples' interests and needs.\n\nThe first generation of economic reconstructionists included Thorstein Veblen and John Dewey. The second generation included Lewis Mumford. The third generation included Seymour Melman, Percival Goodman and Paul Goodman. Key reconstructionists today include Barry Commoner, Gar Alperovitz and Marcus Raskin. Key figures whose work informs the critique of contemporary society found in the work of economic reconstructionists include Stanley Aronowitz (in his writings about social movements, the state, universities and culture), Noam Chomsky in his writings about anarchist cooperatives and democracy, and John Kenneth Galbraith (in his writings about the economy and economists). Another important figure is Simone Weil whose writings about problems or limits attached to militarism, social science atomization, Marxism, the economy and political parties all resonate with an economic reconstruction agenda.\n\nAdvocates of economic reconstruction advocate fundamental change related to key social problems related to environmental decay, militarism, parasitic globalization, unemployment and depressed living standards based on the social organization of work. In the environment, a key challenge is redesigning \"the technosphere\" or the ways in which the means of production, transportation and distribution are designed on a relatively unsustainable basis. When it comes to militarism, the key challenge is to support a demilitarized society through economic conversion, disarmament, alternative security, military budget reductions and related social innovations. When it comes to unemployment and depressed living standards, a key challenge is to promote economic democracy, through concrete institutions and actions such as cooperatives, worker participation and control, employee ownership plans, socially responsible firms, community procurement, and various initiatives to organize the economy on a decentralized basis. In many cases, federations among local cooperatives or networks of such firms may prove essential to move beyond the problem of \"economic democracy in one firm.\"\n\nEconomic reconstruction also extends to the ways in which housing or communities and media are organized. By reducing dependency on the automobile, by linking work and residence, we can limit the problems creating by congestion, pollution and commuting (particularly those problems based on petroleum based automobile transportation.\n\nSome may argue that economic reconstruction can be reduced to socialism or economic democracy itself or perhaps principles found in various anarchist or radical writings. The problem, however, is that many of these plans lack operational details related to how alternative institutions would actually be designed. These details are essential for creating operational plans and actions. In addition, economic reconstruction is not limited to a specific challenge such as capitalism, but must also address other challenges, i.e. militarism, environmental decay, the sexual and ethnic division of labor, etc. A goal of economic reconstruction is to show the need for multiple, yet integrated solutions to societal breakdown.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "862471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=862471", "title": "Effeminacy", "text": "Effeminacy\n\nEffeminacy is the manifestation of traits in a boy or man that are more often associated with feminine nature, behavior, mannerism, style, or gender roles rather than with masculine nature, behavior, mannerisms, style or roles. It is a term frequently applied to womanly behavior, demeanor, style, clothing and appearance displayed by a boy or man.\n\nUntil the modern period, effeminacy in the Western tradition referred to a complicated intersection of both social (or civic) and sexual identities typically associated with women. The ancient Greeks, for example, described whole societies as effeminate (malakia) if they were characterized by a slavish, deferential, or autocratic political culture. Here, it was the form of sexual relationships, but not the fact of homosexual relations (which were not uncommon among Greek citizens who were men) that was critical to the sexual dimension of the term. And among early modern partisans of the republican tradition, the term might be applied to those who were preoccupied with \"womanly\" concerns, such as the accoutrements of appearance, which were often associated with trappings of nobility or aristocratic aspirations, such as ostentatious dress, decadence in consumption habits, and rigid adherence to the proprieties or manners of social hierarchy. The reach of this \"civic\" understanding may be best illustrated in the work of early feminist and republican thinkers such as Mary Wollstonecraft, who described as \"effeminate\" the behavior of women who refused to embrace a more active presence in public life.\n\nSince the 18th century, the civic dimension of gender identity has been eclipsed by the sexual dimension of gender identity, and, today, effeminacy has often been considered a vice, indicative of other negative character traits and often involving a pejorative insinuation of homosexual tendencies in boys or men. In other societies, by contrast, effeminate boys or men may be considered a distinct human gender (third gender), and may have a special social function, as is the case of Two-Spirits in some Native American groups. Furthermore, some see effeminacy to be a characteristic or trait, part of a particular person's gender role and in this sense would not be considered a vice or indicative of any other characteristics. An effeminate boy or man is similar to a \"fop\" or a \"dandy\", though these tend to be archaic identities that are taken on by the individual rather than insulting labels.\n\n\"Effeminate\" comes from the Latin \"effeminātus\", from \"ex\" which is \"out,\" and \"femina\" which means woman; it means \"to be like a woman.\" Another Latin term is \"mollities\", meaning \"softness.\"\n\nIn ancient Koine Greek, the word for effeminate is κίναιδος \"kinaidos\" (\"cinaedus\" in its Latinized form), or μαλακοί \"malakoi\": a man \"whose most salient feature was a supposedly \"feminine\" love of being sexually penetrated by other men.\"\n\n\"A \"cinaedus\" is a man who cross-dresses or flirts like a girl. Indeed, the word's etymology suggests an indirect sexual act emanating a promiscuous woman. This term has been borrowed from the Greek \"kinaidos\" (which may itself have come from a language of Ionian Greecs of Asia Minor, primarily signifying a purely effeminate dancer who entertained his audiences with a \"tympanum\" or tambourine in his hand, and adopted a lascivious style, often suggestively wiggling his buttocks in such a way as to suggest anal intercourse...The primary meaning of \"cinaedus\" never died out; the term never became a dead metaphor.\"\n\nOther vernacular words for effeminacy include: \"pansy\", \"nelly\", \"pretty boy\", \"nancy boy\", \"molly\", \"sissy\", \"pussy\", and \"girl\" (when applied to a boy or, especially, adult man). Contrastingly, a masculine girl would be called a \"tomboy\", \"butch\", or \"dyke\". The word \"effete\" similarly means effeminacy or over-refinement, but comes from the Latin \"effetus\", from \"ex-\" and \"fetus\" \"fruitful\".\n\nGreek historian Plutarch recounts that Periander, the tyrant of Ambracia, asked his \"boy\", \"Aren't you pregnant yet?\" in the presence of other people, causing the boy to kill him in revenge for being treated as if effeminate or a woman (\"Amatorius\" 768F).\n\nAs part of Greek politician's (Aeschines') proof that a member of the prosecution against him, Timarchus, had prostituted himself to (or been \"kept\" by) another man while young, he attributed fellow prosecutor Demosthenes' nickname Batalos (\"arse\") to his \"unmanliness and \"kinaidiā\"\" and frequently commented on his \"unmanly and womanish temper\", even criticising his clothing: \"If anyone took those dainty little coats and soft shirts off you... and took them round for the jurors to handle, I think they'd be quite unable to say, if they hadn't been told in advance, whether they had hold of a man's clothing or a woman's.\"\n\nDemosthenes is also implicated in passive homosexuality and the prostitution of youth: \"There is a certain Aristion, a Plataean..., who as a youth was outstandingly good-looking and lived for a long time in Demosthenes' house. Allegations about the part he was playing [lit., 'undergoing or doing what'] there vary, and it would be most unseemly for me to talk about it.\"\n\nThe late Greek \"Erôtes\" (\"Loves\", \"Forms of Desire\", \"Affairs of the Heart\"), preserved with manuscripts by Lucian, contains a debate \"between two men, Charicles and Callicratidas, over the relative merits of women and boys as vehicles of male sexual pleasure.\" Callicratidas, \"far from being effeminised by his sexual predilection for boys... Callicratidas's inclination renders him hypervirile... Callicratidas's sexual desire for boys, then, makes him more of a man; it does not weaken or subvert his male gender identity but rather consolidates it.\" In contrast, \"Charicles' erotic preference for women seems to have had the corresponding effect of effeminising him: when the reader first encounters him, for example, Charicles is described as exhibiting 'a skillful use of cosmetics, so as to be attractive to women.'\"\n\nOver-refinement, fine clothes and other possessions, the company of women, certain trades, and too much fondness with women were all deemed effeminate traits in Roman society. Taking an inappropriate sexual position, passive or \"bottom\", in same-gender sex was considered effeminate and unnatural. Touching the head with a finger and wearing a goatee were also considered effeminate.\n\nRoman consul Scipio Aemilianus questioned one of his opponents, P. Sulpicius Galus: \"For the kind of man who adorns himself daily in front of a mirror, wearing perfume; whose eyebrows are shaved off; who walks around with plucked beard and thighs; who when he was a young man reclined at banquets next to his lover, wearing a long-sleeved tunic; who is fond of men as he is of wine: can anyone doubt that he has done what \"cinaedi\" are in the habit of doing?\"\n\nRoman orator Quintilian described, \"The plucked body, the broken walk, the female attire,\" as \"signs of one who is soft [mollis] and not a real man.\"\n\nFor Roman men masculinity also meant self-control, even in the face of painful emotions, illnesses, or death. Cicero says, \"There exist certain precepts, even laws, that prohibit a man from being effeminate in pain,\" and Seneca adds, \"If I must suffer illness, it will be my wish to do nothing out of control, nothing effeminately.\"\n\nEmperor/philosopher Julian the Apostate, in his \"Against the Galileans\", wrote: <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Why the Egyptians are more intelligent and more given to crafts, and the Syrians unwarlike and effeminate, but at the same time intelligent, hot-tempered, vain and quick to learn?<nowiki>\"</nowiki>\n\nIn his \"Commentaries on the Gallic Wars\", Julius Caesar wrote that the Belgians were the bravest of all Gauls because \"merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind\".\n\nEmperor Marcus Aurelius evidently considered effeminacy an undesirable trait, but it is unclear as to what or who was being referred.\n\n\"Malakos\" is listed among other vices in the New Testament book of I Corinthians 6:9. Translations use different terms to express this. The online Greek Interlinear Bible uses Strongs concordance (last corrected in 2008) translates \"Malakoi\" as \"Catamites\", and \"Arsenokoitia\" as \"sodomites\". The word \"malakos\", #3120 in the Greek Dictionary of The New Testament of James Strong's Exhaustive Concordance to The Bible states: \"of uncertain affinity\".\n\nIn the United States, boys are often homosocial, and gender role performance determines social rank. While gay boys receive the same enculturation, they are less compliant, Martin Levine summarizes: \"Harry (1982, 51–52), for example, found that 42 percent of his gay respondents were 'sissies' during childhood. Only 11 percent of his heterosexual samples were gender-role nonconformists. Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981, 188) reported that half of their male homosexual subjects practiced gender-inappropriate behaviour in childhood. Among their heterosexual men, the rate of noncompliance was 25 percent. Saghir and Robins (1973, 18) found that one-third of their gay man respondents conformed to gender role dictates. Only 3 percent of their heterosexual men deviated from the norm.\" Thus effeminate boys, or sissies, are physically and verbally harassed (Saghir and Robins, 1973, 17–18; Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith 1981, 74–84), causing them to feel worthless and \"de-feminise\".\n\nPrior to the Stonewall riots, inconsistent gender role performance had been noticed among gay men: \"They have a different face for different occasions. In conversations with each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men who appeared to be normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as they greeted homosexual friends [...] Many times I saw these changes occur after I had gained a homosexual's confidence and he could safely risk my disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate caricature of himself, he apologised, 'It is hard to always remember that one is a man.'\"\nPre-Stonewall \"closet\" culture accepted homosexuality as effeminate behaviour, and thus emphasized camp, drag, and swish including an interest in fashion and decorating. Masculine gay men were marginalised and formed their own communities, such as the leather subculture and Western, and/or wore clothes that were commonly associated with working-class individuals, such as sailor uniforms.\n\nPost-Stonewall, \"clone culture\" became dominant and effeminacy was at the time marginalised. One indicator of this is a definite preference shown in personal ads for masculine-behaving men.\n\nThe avoidance of effeminacy by men, including gay ones, has been linked to possible impedance of personal and public health. Regarding HIV/AIDS, masculine behaviour was stereotyped as being unconcerned about safe sex practices while engaging in promiscuous sexual behaviour. Early reports from New York City indicated that more women had themselves tested for HIV/AIDS than men.\n\nDavid Halperin compares \"universalising\" and \"minoritising\" notions of gender deviance: \"'Softness' either may represent the specter of potential gender failure that haunts all normative masculinity, an ever-present threat to the masculinity of every man, or it may represent the disfiguring peculiarity of a small class of deviant individuals.\"\n\nThe term \"effeminiphobia\" (sometimes \"effemiphobic\", as used by Randy P. Conner, or \"femmephobia\") was coined by Will Fellows to describe strong anti-effeminacy. Michael Bailey coined the similar term femiphobia to describe the ambivalence gay men and culture have about effeminate behaviour in 1995. Gay author Tim Bergling popularized the term \"sissyphobia\" in \",\" although it was used before. Transsexual writer and biologist Julia Serano has coined the similar term \"effemimania\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5042951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5042951", "title": "Global warming", "text": "Global warming\n\nGlobal warming is a long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system, an aspect of climate change shown by temperature measurements and by multiple effects of the warming. The term commonly refers to the mainly human-caused observed warming since pre-industrial times and its projected continuation, though there were also much earlier periods of global warming. In the modern context the terms are commonly used interchangeably, but \"global warming\" more specifically relates to worldwide surface temperature increases; while \"climate change\" is any regional or global statistically identifiable persistent change in the state of climate which lasts for decades or longer, including warming or cooling. Many of the observed warming changes since the 1950s are unprecedented in the instrumental temperature record, and in historical and paleoclimate proxy records of climate change over thousands to millions of years.\n\nIn 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report concluded, \"It is that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\" The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. In view of the dominant role of human activity in causing it, the phenomenon is sometimes called \" global warming\" or \" climate change\". Climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century, the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further to depending on the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.\n\nFuture climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region. Ongoing and anticipated effects include rising sea levels, changing precipitation, and expansion of deserts in the subtropics. Future warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, wildfires, heavy rainfall with floods, and heavy snowfall; ocean acidification; and massive extinctions of species due to shifting temperature regimes. Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels. Because the climate system has a large \"inertia\" and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time, many of these effects will persist for not only decades or centuries, but tens of thousands of years.\n\nPossible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects, building systems resilient to its effects, and possible future climate engineering. Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change. Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required and that global warming should be limited to well below compared to pre-industrial levels, with efforts made to limit warming to . Some scientists call into question climate adaptation feasibility, with higher emissions scenarios, or the two degree temperature target.\n\nPublic reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing. A global 2015 Pew Research Center report showed that a median of 54% of all respondents asked consider it \"a very serious problem\". Significant regional differences exist, with Americans and Chinese (whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual CO emissions) among the least concerned.\n\nMultiple independently produced datasets confirm that from 1880 to 2012 the global average (land and ocean) surface temperature increased by 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C. From 1906 to 2005, Earth's average surface temperature rose by . The rate of warming almost doubled in the last half of that period (, against ). Although the popular press often reports the increase of the average near-surface atmospheric temperature as \"the\" measure of global warming, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has accumulated in the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and the atmosphere.\n\nSince 1979, the average temperature of the lower troposphere has increased between  per decade, satellite temperature measurements confirm. Climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850, with regionally varying fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.\n\nThe warming evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, as documented by many independent scientific groups. Examples include sea level rise, widespread melting of snow and land ice, increased heat content of the oceans, increased humidity, and the earlier timing of spring events, e.g., the flowering of plants. The probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero.\n\nGlobal warming refers to global averages. It is not uniform around the world: effects can vary by region. Since 1979, global average land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as global average ocean temperatures ( against ). Ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger heat capacity of the oceans and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation. Since the beginning of industrialisation in the 18th century, the temperature difference between the hemispheres has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the North, and because there is more land in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn the past 100 years, average Arctic temperatures have increased at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world. This has been referred to as Arctic amplification.\n\nAlthough more greenhouse gases are emitted in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere, this does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to diffuse within and between the two hemispheres.\n\nThere are different ways in which a climate can be forced to change, but because the climate system has large thermal inertia, it can take centuries – or even longer – for the climate to fully adjust. One climate commitment study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000 levels, surface temperatures would still increase by about 0.5 °C, and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005 levels, surface warming could exceed a whole degree Celsius. Some of this surface warming would be driven by past natural forcings which have not yet reached equilibrium in the climate system. One study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64% of the committed 2050 surface warming, and their influence will fade with time compared to the human contribution.\n\nGlobal temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends, and can temporarily mask or magnify them. The relative stability in surface temperature from 2002 to 2009, which has since been dubbed the global warming hiatus by the media and some scientists, may be an example of such an episode. 2015 updates to account for differing methods of ocean surface temperature measurements show a positive trend over the recent decade.\n\nSixteen of the seventeen warmest years on record have occurred since 2000. While record-breaking years attract considerable public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend. Some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to \"warmest year\" statistics. In particular, ocean oscillations such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can cause temperatures of a given year to be abnormally warm or cold for reasons unrelated to the overall trend of climate change. Gavin Schmidt stated: \"the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not.\"\n\nBy itself, the climate system may generate random changes in global temperatures for years to decades at a time, but long-term changes emanate only from so-called \"external forcings.\" These forcings are \"external\" to the climate system, but not necessarily external to Earth. Examples of external forcings include changes in the composition of the atmosphere (e.g., increased concentrations of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\nThe greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planet's atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface. It was proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, discovered in 1860 by John Tyndall, was first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, and the hypothesis was reported in the popular press as early as 1912. The scientific description of global warming was further developed in the 1930s through 1960s by Guy Stewart Callendar.\nOn Earth, an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be warmer by about than it would be in their absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water. The major greenhouse gases are water vapour, which causes about 36–70% of the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO), which causes 9–26%; methane (CH), which causes 4–9%; and ozone (O), which causes 3–7%.\n\nHuman activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs, and nitrous oxide. According to work published in 2007, the concentrations of CO and methane had increased by 36% and 148% respectively since 1750. These levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores. Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago.\n\nFossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in CO from human activity over the past 20 years. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use, particularly deforestation. Another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic CO emissions is the calcination of limestone for clinker production, a chemical process which releases CO. Estimates of global CO emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion, including cement production and gas flaring, was 34.8 billion tonnes (9.5 ± 0.5 PgC), an increase of 54% above emissions in 1990. Coal burning was responsible for 43% of the total emissions, oil 34%, gas 18%, cement 4.9% and gas flaring 0.7%.\n\nIn May 2013, it was reported that readings for CO taken at the world's primary benchmark site in Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm. According to professor Brian Hoskins, this is likely the first time CO levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years. Monthly global CO concentrations exceeded 400 ppm in March 2015, probably for the first time in several million years. On 12 November 2015, NASA scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years; currently, about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere.\nOver the last three decades of the twentieth century, gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions. CO emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change. Emissions can be attributed to different regions. Attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\nEmissions scenarios, estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases, have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic, sociological, technological, and natural developments. In most scenarios, emissions continue to rise over the century, while in a few, emissions are reduced. Fossil fuel reserves are abundant, and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century.\nEmission scenarios, combined with modelling of the carbon cycle, have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future. Using the six IPCC SRES \"marker\" scenarios, models suggest that by the year 2100, the atmospheric concentration of CO could range between 541 and 970 ppm.\n\nGlobal dimming, a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface, was observed from 1961 until at least 1990. Solid and liquid particles known as \"aerosols\", produced by volcanoes and human-made pollutants, are thought to be the main cause of this dimming. They exert a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight. The effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion – CO and aerosols – have partially offset one another in recent decades, so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-CO greenhouse gases such as methane. Radiative forcing due to aerosols is temporally limited due to the processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere. Removal by clouds and precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week, while stratospheric aerosols can remain for a few years. Carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more, and as such, changes in aerosols will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide. Black carbon is second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming (contribution being estimated at 17 to 20%, whereas carbon dioxide contributes 40 to 45% to global warming).\n\nIn addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, aerosols have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget. Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets, a phenomenon known as the Twomey effect. This effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size, which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight, known as the Albrecht effect. Indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds, and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds. Indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.\n\nSoot may either cool or warm Earth's climate system, depending on whether it is airborne or deposited. Atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation, which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface. In isolated areas with high soot production, such as rural India, as much as 50% of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds. When deposited, especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions, the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface. The influences of atmospheric particles, including black carbon, are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics, particularly in Asia, while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere.\n\nSince 1978, solar irradiance has been measured by satellites.\n\nClimate models have been used to examine the role of the Sun in recent climate change. Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when only taking into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity.\n\nAnother line of evidence for the Sun's non-attributability is the differing temperature changes at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere. According to basic physical principles, the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), but cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected.\n\nThe tilt of the Earth's axis and the shape of its orbit around the Sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years. This changes climate by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy at Earth's surface.\nDuring the last few thousand years, this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during summer, a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century. Orbital cycles favorable for glaciation are not expected within the next 50,000 years.\n\nA range of \"feedbacks\" govern the response of the system to changes in forcings. Positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing, while negative feedbacks reduce it.\n\nThere are a range of feedbacks in the climate system, including water vapour, changes in ice–albedo (snow and ice cover affect how much the Earth's surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight), clouds, and changes in the Earth's carbon cycle (e.g., the release of carbon from soil). The main negative feedback is via radiative cooling to space as infrared radiation, which increases strongly with increasing temperature\n\nFeedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Other factors being equal, a higher \"climate sensitivity\" means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing. Uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario. More research is needed to understand the role of clouds and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections.\n\nAn observation based study on future climate change, on the soil carbon feedback, conducted since 1991 in Harvard, suggests the pending release of about 190 petagrams of soil carbon, the equivalent of the past two decades of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning, up through the year 2100 from the top 1-meter of Earth's soils, due to changes in microbial communities under elevated temperatures. Climate models do not account for this possible feedback mechanism. Another study conducted by Harvard researchers suggests that increased water vapor injected into the stratosphere, due to rising temperatures, increases ozone depletion, subsequently raising the odds of skin cancer and damaging crops.\n\nArctic temperatures have increased at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world. This appears to arise both from an intensification of poleward heat transport and more directly from changes in the local net radiation balance. Some examples of feedbacks thought to contribute include the reduction of snow cover and sea ice, changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation, the presence of anthropogenic soot in the Arctic environment, increases in cloud cover, and water vapor. According to the 2013 IPCC report, models often tend to underestimate Arctic amplification. Studies have linked the rapidly warming Arctic to a vanishing cryosphere, and extreme weather in mid-latitudes. and changes in the jet stream.\n\nA climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system.\n\nAlthough researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible, simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system. Results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model's climate sensitivity. For example, the uncertainty in IPCC's 2007 projections is caused by (1) the use of multiple models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations, (2) the use of differing estimates of humanity's future greenhouse gas emissions, (3) any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models IPCC used to prepare its report, i.e., greenhouse gas releases from permafrost.\n\nThe models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes. Warming or cooling is thus a result, not an assumption, of the models.\n\nClouds and their effects are especially difficult to predict. Improving the models' representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current research. Another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon cycle.\n\nModels are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes. Although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects, they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates. Climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century, but do not simulate all aspects of climate. Not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the IPCC. Observed Arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted. Precipitation increased proportionally to atmospheric humidity, and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict. Since 1990, sea level has also risen considerably faster than models predicted it would. The 2017 United States published National Climate Assessment, notes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\".\n\nOverall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems. Rising temperatures have been found to push bees to their physiological limits, and could cause the extinction of bee populations. A 2012 study concluded that continued ocean uptake of CO affects the brains and central nervous system of certain fish species and this impacts their ability to hear, smell, and evade predators. The study authors note, \"We've now established it isn't simply the acidification of the oceans that is causing disruption – as is the case with shellfish and plankton with chalky skeletons – but the actual dissolved CO itself is damaging the fishes' nervous systems.\"\n\nThe environmental effects of global warming are broad and far reaching. They include the following diverse effects:\n\nThe effects of climate change on human systems, mostly due to warming or shifts in precipitation patterns, or both, have been detected worldwide. The future social impacts of climate change will be uneven across the world. Many risks are expected to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming. All regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts. Low-latitude, less developed areas face the greatest risk. A study from 2015 concluded that economic growth (gross domestic product) of poorer countries is much more impaired with projected future climate warming, than previously thought. In small islands and mega deltas, inundation as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements. This could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low-lying areas such as Bangladesh, as well as statelessness for populations in countries such as the Maldives and Tuvalu.\n\nExamples of impacts of global warming on humans include:\n\nThe Arctic, Africa, small islands and Asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future climate change. Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change because of multiple existing stresses and low adaptive capacity. Existing stresses include poverty, political conflicts, and ecosystem degradation. By 2050, between 350 million and 600 million people are projected to experience increased water stress due to climate change (see Climate change in Africa). Climate variability and change is projected to severely compromise agricultural production, including access to food, across Africa. Research projects that regions even may become uninhabitable, due to a high wet-bulb temperature.\n\nMitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. There is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities, including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency; the use of low-carbon energy technologies, such as renewable energy, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage; and enhancing carbon sinks through, for example, reforestation and preventing deforestation.\nA 2015 report by Citibank concluded that transitioning to a low carbon economy would yield positive return on investments.\n\nNear- and long-term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming at below 1.5 or 2 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels. Pledges made as part of the Cancún agreements are broadly consistent with having a likely chance (66 to 100% probability) of limiting global warming (in the 21st century) at below 3 °C, relative to pre-industrial levels.\n\nIn limiting warming at below 2 °C, more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030. Many integrated models are unable to meet the 2 °C target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the availability of mitigation technologies.\n\nClimate change adaptation is another policy response. The adaptation may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of global warming, or spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention. Planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis. The barriers, limits, and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood. Environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail, while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.\n\nAdaptation is especially important in developing countries since those countries are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming. That is, the capacity and potential for humans to adapt (called adaptive capacity) is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt.\n\nClimate engineering (sometimes called \"geoengineering\" or \"climate intervention\") is the deliberate modification of the climate. It has been investigated as a possible response to global warming, e.g. by NASA and the Royal Society. Techniques under research fall generally into the categories solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal, although various other schemes have been suggested. A study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change.\n\nMost countries in the world are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThe ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.\nAs stated in the Convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion. The Framework Convention was agreed on in 1992, but global emissions have risen since then.\n\nDuring negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing 133 developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing their emissions. This was justified on the basis that the developed countries' emissions had contributed most to the cumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, per-capita emissions (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still relatively low in developing countries, and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.\n\nThis mandate was sustained in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention, which entered into legal effect in 2005. In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions. These first-round commitments expired in 2012.\nUnited States President George W. Bush rejected the treaty on the basis that \"it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centres such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy\".\n\nAt the 15th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, held in 2009 at Copenhagen, several UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord. Parties associated with the Accord (140 countries, ) aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below . The 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) was held at Cancún in 2010. It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to above pre-industrial temperatures. It also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of .\n\nThe discussion continues in scientific articles that are peer-reviewed and assessed by scientists who\nwork in the relevant fields and participate in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The scientific consensus stated in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report is that it \"is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century\".\nA 2008 report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In 2005 the Royal Society stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points, some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions had tried to undermine the science and work of the IPCC. National science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions.\n\nIn 2018, the IPCC published SR15, which warned that if current rate of greenhouse gas emissions are not mitigated, major crises could occur by 2040 as the planet warms by 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). The report said that preventing such crises will require a swift transformation of the global economy that has \"no documented historic precedent.\"\n\nIn the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view. In November 2017, a second warning to humanity signed by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries stated that \"the current trajectory of potentially catastrophic climate change due to rising greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural productionparticularly from farming ruminants for meat consumption\" is \"especially troubling\". A July 2017 study published in \"Environmental Research Letters\" asserts that the most significant action individuals could make to mitigate their own carbon footprint is to have fewer children, followed by living vehicle free, forgoing air travel and adopting a plant-based diet.\n\nThe global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes, substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature, regarding the nature, causes, and consequences of global warming. The disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature, especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether humankind has contributed significantly to it, and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity, predictions of additional warming, and what the consequences of global warming will be.\n\nIn the United States from about 1990 onwards, American conservative think tanks had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They challenged the scientific evidence, argued that global warming would have benefits, and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good. Some people dispute aspects of climate change science. Organizations such as the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, conservative commentators, and some companies such as ExxonMobil have challenged IPCC climate change scenarios, funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus, and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls. On the other hand, some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years, or even called for policies to reduce global warming. Global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nThe global warming problem came to international public attention in the late 1980s. Polling groups began to track opinions on the subject, at first mainly in the United States. The longest consistent polling, by Gallup in the US, found relatively small deviations of 10% or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming, but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned.\n\nDue to confusing media coverage in the early 1990s, issues such as ozone depletion and climate change were often mixed up, affecting public understanding of these issues. According to a 2010 survey of Americans, a majority thought that the ozone layer and spray cans contribute to global warming. Although there are a few areas of linkage, the relationship between the two is not strong. Reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures, while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect. However, the CFC's used in spray cans are powerful greenhouse gases, with some estimates attributing CFC emissions during the 70s to have caused almost half of the global warming for that decade.\n\nBy 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there had been a substantial decrease since 2007–2008 in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat. In the US, just a little over half the population (53%) viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10 points below the 2008 poll (63%). Latin America had the biggest rise in concern: 73% said global warming was a serious threat to their families. This global poll also found that people were more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in the US where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to natural causes.\n\nA March–May 2013 survey by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press polled 39 countries about global threats. According to 54% of those questioned, global warming featured top of the perceived global threats.\n\nThe history of climate change science began in the early 19th century when ice ages and other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse effect first identified. In the late 19th century, scientists first argued that human emissions of greenhouse gases could change the climate. In the 1960s, the warming effect of carbon dioxide gas became increasingly convincing. By the 1990s, as a result of improving fidelity of computer models and observational work confirming the Milankovitch theory of the ice ages, a consensus position formed: greenhouse gases were deeply involved in most climate changes and human caused emissions were bringing discernible global warming. Since the 1990s, scientific research on climate change has included multiple disciplines and has expanded. Research during this period has been summarized in the Assessment Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nIn the 1950s, research suggested increasing temperatures, and a 1952 newspaper reported \"climate change\". This phrase next appeared in a November 1957 report in \"The Hammond Times\" which described Roger Revelle's research into the effects of increasing human-caused emissions on the greenhouse effect, \"a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result\". Both phrases were used only occasionally until 1975, when Wallace Smith Broecker published a scientific paper on the topic, \"Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?\" The phrase began to come into common use, and in 1976 Mikhail Budyko's statement that \"a global warming up has started\" was widely reported. Other studies, such as a 1971 MIT report, referred to the human impact as \"inadvertent climate modification\", but an influential 1979 National Academy of Sciences study headed by Jule Charney followed Broecker in using \"global warming\" for rising surface temperatures, while describing the wider effects of increased as \"climate change\".\n\nIn 1986 and November 1987, NASA climate scientist James Hansen gave testimony to Congress on global warming. There were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988, and when Hansen testified in the Senate on 23 June he sparked worldwide interest. He said, \"global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.\" Public attention increased over the summer, and \"global warming\" became the dominant popular term, commonly used both by the press and in public discourse.\n\nIn a 2008 NASA article on usage, Erik M. Conway defined \"global warming\" as \"the increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases\", while \"climate change\" was \"a long-term change in the Earth's climate, or of a region on Earth\". Because effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone, he considered \"global climate change\" a more scientifically accurate term, and like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the NASA website emphasized this wider context.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52980", "title": "Hakka Chinese", "text": "Hakka Chinese\n\nHakka, also rendered Kejia, is one of the major groups of varieties of Chinese, spoken natively by the Hakka people throughout southern China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and throughout the diaspora areas of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and in overseas Chinese communities around the world.\n\nDue to its primary usage in scattered isolated regions where communication is limited to the local area, Hakka has developed numerous varieties or dialects, spoken in different provinces, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Fujian, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi and Guizhou, as well as in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Hakka is not mutually intelligible with Yue, Wu, Southern Min, Mandarin or other branches of Chinese, and itself contains a few mutually unintelligible varieties. It is most closely related to Gan and is sometimes classified as a variety of Gan, with a few northern Hakka varieties even being partially mutually intelligible with southern Gan. There is also a possibility that the similarities are just a result of shared areal features.\n\nTaiwan, where Hakka is the native language of a significant minority of the island's residents, is a center for the study and preservation of the language. Pronunciation differences exist between the Taiwanese Hakka dialects and Mainland China's Hakka dialects; even in Taiwan, two major local varieties of Hakka exist.\n\nThe Meixian dialect (Moiyen) of northeast Guangdong in China has been taken as the \"standard\" dialect by the People's Republic of China. The Guangdong Provincial Education Department created an official romanization of Moiyen in 1960, one of four languages receiving this status in Guangdong.\n\nThe name of the Hakka people who are the predominant original native speakers of the variety literally means \"guest families\" or \"guest people\": \"Hak\" 客 (Mandarin: \"kè\") means \"guest\", and \"ka\" 家 (Mandarin: \"jiā\") means \"family\". Among themselves, Hakka people variously called their language \"Hak-ka-fa\" (\"-va\") 客家話, \"Hak-fa\" (\"-va\") 客話, \"Tu-gong-dung-fa\" (\"-va\") 土廣東話, literally \"Native Guangdong language\", and \"Ngai-fa\" (\"-va\") 我話, \"My/our language\". In Tonggu county (铜鼓县), Jiangxi province, people call their language \"Huai-yuan-fa\" 怀远話.\n\nIt is commonly believed that Hakka people have their origins in several episodes of migration from northern China into southern China during periods of war and civil unrest dating back as far as the end of Western Jin. The forebears of the Hakka came from present-day Central Plains provinces of Henan and Shaanxi, and brought with them features of Chinese varieties spoken in those areas during that time. (Since then, the speech in those regions has evolved into dialects of modern Mandarin). The presence of many archaic features occur in modern Hakka, including final consonants , as are found in other modern southern Chinese varieties, but which have been lost in Mandarin.\n\nLaurent Sagart (2002) considers Hakka and southern Gan Chinese to be sister dialects that descended from a single common ancestral language (Proto-Southern Gan) spoken in central Jiangxi during the Song Dynasty. In Hakka and southern Gan, Sagart (2002) identifies a non-Chinese substratum that is possibly Hmong-Mien, an archaic layer, and a more recent Late Middle Chinese layer. Lexical connections between Hakka, Kra-Dai, and Hmong-Mien have also been suggested by Deng (1999).\n\nDue to the migration of its speakers, Hakka may have been influenced by other language areas through which the Hakka-speaking forebears migrated. For instance, common vocabulary is found in Hakka, Min, and the She (Hmong–Mien) languages. Today, most She people in Fujian and Zhejiang speak Shehua, which is closely related to Hakka.\n\nA regular pattern of sound change can generally be detected in Hakka, as in most Chinese varieties, of the derivation of phonemes from earlier forms of Chinese. Some examples:\n\nHakka has as many regional dialects as there are counties with Hakka speakers as the majority. Some of these Hakka dialects are not mutually intelligible with each other. Surrounding Meixian are the counties of Pingyuan, Dabu, Jiaoling, Xingning, Wuhua, and Fengshun. Each is said to have its own special phonological points of interest. For instance, Xingning lacks the codas and . These have merged into and , respectively. Further away from Meixian, the Hong Kong dialect lacks the medial, so, whereas Meixian pronounces the character 光 as , Hong Kong Hakka dialect pronounces it as , which is similar to the Hakka spoken in neighbouring Shenzhen.\n\nAs much as endings and vowels are important, the tones also vary across the dialects of Hakka. The majority of Hakka dialects have six tones. However, there are dialects which have lost all of their checked tone (Ru Sheng), and the characters originally of this tone class are distributed across the non-Ru tones. Such a dialect is Changting which is situated in the Western Fujian province. Moreover, there is evidence of the retention of an earlier Hakka tone system in the dialects of Haifeng and Lufeng situated on coastal south eastern Guangdong province. They contain a yin-yang splitting in the Qu tone, giving rise to seven tones in all (with yin-yang registers in Ping and Ru tones and a Shang tone).\n\nIn Taiwan, there are two main dialects: Sixian and Hailu (alternatively known as Haifeng). Most Hakka dialect speakers found on Taiwan originated from these two regions. Sixian speakers come from Jiaying Prefecture (), mainly from the four counties of Chengxiang (now Meixian), Zhengping (now Jiaoling), Xingning and Pingyuan. The Hailu dialect contains postalveolar consonants (, , and ), which are uncommon in other southern Chinese varieties. Wuhua, Dabu, and Xingning dialects have two sets of fricatives and affricates.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" reports the dialects as \"Yue-Tai\" (Meixian, Wuhua, Raoping, Taiwan Kejia: Meizhou above), \"Yuezhong \"(Central Guangdong), \"Huizhou, Yuebei\" (Northern Guangdong), \"Tingzhou\" (Min-Ke), \"Ning-Long\" (Longnan), \"Yugui, Tonggu.\"\n\nLike other southern Chinese varieties, Hakka retains single syllable words from earlier stages of Chinese; thus a large number of syllables are distinguished by tone and final consonant. This reduces the need for compounding or making words of more than one syllable. However, it is also similar to other Chinese varieties in having words which are made from more than one syllable.\n\nHakka prefers the verb when referring to \"saying\" rather than the Mandarin \"shuō\" 說 (Hakka ).\n\nHakka uses , like Cantonese for the verb \"to eat\" and (Hakka ) for \"to drink\", unlike Mandarin which prefers \"chī\" (Hakka ) as \"to eat\" and \"hē\" (Hakka ) as \"to drink\" where the meanings in Hakka are different, \"to stutter\" and \"to be thirsty\" respectively.\n\nVarious dialects of Hakka have been written in a number of Latin orthographies, largely for religious purposes, since at least the mid-19th century.\n\nPreviously, the single largest work in Hakka was the New Testament and Psalms (1993, 1138 pp., see The Bible in Chinese: Hakka), but since 2012 that has been surpassed by the publication of the complete Hakka Bible known as the and includes the Old Testament along with audio recordings. These works render Hakka in both romanization (pha̍k-fa-sṳ) and Han characters (including ones unique to Hakka) and are based on the dialects of Taiwanese Hakka speakers. The work of Biblical translation is being performed by missionaries of the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nThe popular \"The Little Prince\" has also been translated into Hakka (2000), specifically the Miaoli dialect of Taiwan (itself a variant of the Sixian dialect).

It is held annually in September to honor Queen Oronsen, a mythical wife of Rerengejen.\nDuring the festival, the incumbent Olowo of Owo and high chiefs of Owo Kingdom dresses like women with coral beads, beaded gown and plaited hair. Wearing of headgears and caps as well as booming of drums and firing of guns are not allowed during the festivals.\n\nThe Igogo festival began over 600 years ago during the reign of the late Olowo Rerengejen. The monarch married Oronsen, a beautiful and affluent queen who had, unknown to the king, supernatural powers. She enriched the monarch and she was loved by the monarch. Queen Oronsen insisted on certain taboos. She insisted that nobody should grind Okra in her presence or pour water into the yard. In addition, anyone arriving from the farm must not lump a load of firewood. King Rerengejen cautioned his other wives not to carry out any of these activities.\nOne day, Queen Oronsen had a rift with the other senior wives of the King. They conspired against her with the intention of violating her taboo while Rerengejen was not in the palace. Her taboo was violated and she left the palace.\n\nWhile she was running out of the palace, some palace guards and chiefs ran after her to bring her back, an effort that was futile.\nShe later felt tired and waited at a place called \"Ugbo Laja\" where she was persuaded to return to the palace. Her refusal frustrated the guards into forcefully capturing her but she disappeared into \"Igbo Oluwa\", now a sacred forest, leaving her head ties (oja) at \"Ugbo Laja\" which the guards returned to King Rerengejen. \"Ugbo Laja\" is now a sacred grove. Queen Orosen's terra cotta sculptured image from \"Igbo Oluwa\" by Ekpo Eyo stood at a distance to inform the Owo people that nothing will bring her back to the palace but that annually they should always sacrifice two hundred items of different articles, such as dried fish, kolanut, Aligator pepper, bitter cola and many more for ritual (Igogo) and in return she promised to protect the Kingdom.\n\nIgogo festival lasts for 17 days and begins with Upeli proceedings by the Iloro chiefs. The chiefs are led by \"Akowa\" known as \"Akowa of Iloro\" who is the head of Iloro chiefs. This Upeli procession lasts for 12 days and featured several activities including Utegi, Ugbabo, Uyanna and Ugbate. It is also a period for the celebration of new yams. During this procession, booming of drums by individuals or associations are forbidden and the use of caps by men and head ties by women at close range to the Owo monarch, the Olowo of Owo is forbidden. The festival features the dance of bare-chested men, the Iloro Quarter men called Ighares. They often wear white caps with two horns of buffalo in their hands. They struck these horns together while dancing around the town and visiting some sacred places in the town. During this rite, any animal that crosses their part automatically become their delicacy. The chief plait their hairs and dance round the town and visits their beloved ones who will give them a gift in return. The monarch often dress like women and dances round the town. Dancing in the market by the monarch is also one of the rites performed during the festival.\n\n"}

They include peer support groups and advocacy organizations active on health and medical issues, human rights, legal recognition, and peer and family support. Some groups, including the earliest, were open to people with specific intersex traits, while others are open to people with many different kinds of intersex traits.\n\nIntersex peer support and advocacy organizations have existed since at least 1985, with the establishment of the Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group Australia in 1985. The Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome Support Group (UK) established in 1988. The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) may have been one of the first intersex civil society organizations to have been open to people regardless of diagnosis; it was active from 1993 to 2008.\n\nIntersex organizations are poorly resourced. An international report on \"The State of Trans* and Intersex Organizing\" by Global Action for Trans Equality and the American Jewish World Service in November 2013 found that, globally, \"just over $40,000 addressed intersex issues\" in 2010. At that time, \"6% of all funding for human rights work went to promote LGBTI rights globally ($72.6 million out of $1.2 billion in total).\"\n\nThe Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice established the first Intersex Human Rights Fund in 2015, in an attempt to address resourcing issues.\n\nInternational gatherings are known to have begun in the mid-1990s, including an ISNA retreat in 1996 that brought together activists from North America and New Zealand, and also a summer school organised by OII-France in 2006. The retreat is documented in a short movie entitled \"Hermaphrodites Speak\" and the film \"Intersexion\", and the summer school in a book, \"A qui appartiennent nos corps? Féminisme et luttes intersexes\".\n\nInternational Intersex Forums have taken place since 2011, organized by ILGA. These have brought together intersex activists and organisations from around the world, resulting in joint statements about human rights and bodily autonomy. The Malta declaration of the third forum called for an end to 'normalising' practices, prenatal screening and selective abortions, infanticide and killings, and non-consensual sterilisation. It also made recommendations on sex assignments of intersex children and adults.\n\nThis list contains both intersex-led organizations and some active allied organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30791859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30791859", "title": "Jordanian Arabic", "text": "Jordanian Arabic\n\nJordanian Arabic is a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of Levantine Arabic spoken by the population of the Kingdom of Jordan. Jordanian Arabic varieties are Semitic, with lexical influences from English, Turkish and French. They are spoken by more than 6 million people, and understood throughout the Levant and, to various extents, in other Arabic-speaking regions. As in all Arab countries, language use in Jordan is characterized by diglossia; Modern Standard Arabic is the official language used in most written documents and the media, while daily conversation is conducted in the local colloquial varieties.\n\nAside from the various dialects, one must also deal with the differences in addressing males, females, and groups; plurals and verb conjugations are highly irregular and difficult to determine from their root letters; and there are several letters in the Arab alphabet that are difficult for an English speaker to pronounce.\n\nAlthough there is a common Jordanian dialect mutually understood by most Jordanians, the daily language spoken throughout the country varies significantly through regions. These variants impact altogether pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\nThe Jordanian Arabic comprises five varieties:\n\n\nThe following sections focus on modern Jordanian.\n\nThere is no standard way to write Jordanian Arabic. The sections below use the alphabet used in standard Arabic dialect studies, and the mapping to IPA is given.\n\nOne syllable of every Jordanian word has more stress than the other syllables of that word. Some meaning is communicated in Jordanian by the location of the stress or the tone of the vowel. This is much truer than in other Western languages in the sense that changing the stress position changes the meaning (e.g. ['katabu] means \"they wrote\" while [katabu'] means \"they wrote it\"). This means one has to listen and pronounce the stress carefully.\n\nThere are some phonemes of the Jordanian language that are easily pronounced by English speakers; others are completely foreign to English, making these letters difficult to pronounce.\n\nContrasting with the rich consonant inventory, Jordanian Arabic has much fewer vowels than English. Yet, as in English, vowel duration is relevant (compare /i/ in \"bin\" and \"bean\").\n\nNote : It is tempting to consider /e/ and /i/ as variants of the same phoneme /i/, as well as /o/ and /u/. For the case of e/i, one can oppose 'ente' (you, masculine singular) to 'enti' (you, feminine singular), which makes the difference relevant at least at the end of words.\n\nThe grammar in Jordanian is quite the mixture. Much like Hebrew and Arabic, Jordanian is a Semitic language at heart, altered by the many influences that developed over the years.\n\n\"Il-bāb\" or \"el-port\" meaning \"the door.\"\n\nThis e is pronounced as in a rounded short backward vowel or as in an \"e\" followed by the first letter of the word that follows the article. For example: \"ed-desk\" meaning \"the desk\", \"ej-jakét\" meaning \"the jacket\", \"es-seks\" meaning \"the sex\" or \"hāda' et-téléfón\" meaning \"that is the telephone.\"\n\n<nowiki>'l</nowiki>\n\n\nNote: The Modern dialect is understood by almost everyone in the country and the entire region.\n\nSimilar to ancient and modern semitic languages, Jordanian adds a suffix to a word to indicate possession.\n\n\nIn a sentence, the pronouns change into prefixes to adjust to the verb, its time and its actor. In present perfect and participle with a verb that starts with a consonant \"Ana\" becomes \"ba\", \"Inta\" becomes 'Bt', \"Inti\" becomes \"Bıt\" and so-on.\n\nFor example: The verb \"hıb\" means \"to love\", Bahıb means \"I love\", Bthıb means \"you love\", Bahıbo means \"I love him\", Bıthıbha means \"she loves her\", Bahıbhom means \"I love them\", Bahıbhālí means \"I love myself\".\n\n\"Qdar\" is the infinitive form of the verb \"can\". Baqdar means \"I can\", I can't is \"Baqdareş\", adding an eş or and ış to the end of a verb makes it negative; if the word ends in a vowel then a \"ş\" should be enough.\n\nAn in-depth example of the negation: Baqdarelhomm figuratively means \"I can handle them\", Baqdarelhommeş means \"I cannot handle them\", the same statement meaning can be achieved by \"Baqdareş l'ıl homm\"\n\nThe Jordanian Levantine is not regarded as the official language even though has diverged significantly from Classic Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), or even the colloquial MSA. A large number of Jordanians, however, will call their language \"Arabic\" while they will refer to the original Arabic language as Fusħa. This is common in many countries that speak languages or dialects derived from Arabic and can prove to be quite confusing. The writing system varies; whenever a book is published, it is usually published in English, French, or in MSA and not in Levantine. There are many ways of representing Levantine Arabic in writing. The most common is the scholastic Jordanian Latin alphabet system which uses many accents to distinguish between the letters (this system is used within this article). Other Levantine countries, however, use their own alphabets and transliterations, making cross-border communication inconvenient.\n\nBritish English has a great influence on Jordanian Levantine, depending on the region. English is widely understood in many regions, especially in the western part of the country. English vocabulary has been adopted replacing native Arabic vocabulary in many cases. Literary Arabic is spoken in formal TV programs, and in Modern Standard Arabic classes, it is used to quote poetry and historical phrases. It is also the language used to write and read in formal situations if English is not being used. However, formal Arabic is never spoken during regular conversations, and can prove to be difficult because it removes loan words from English or French origins and replaces them with proper Standard Arabic-derived nouns and verbs. Modern Standard Arabic is taught in most schools and a large number of Jordanian citizens are proficient in reading and writing formal Arabic. However, foreigners residing in Jordan who learn the Levantine language generally find it difficult to comprehend formal MSA, particularly if they did not attend a school that teaches it.\n\nOther influences include French, Turkish and Persian. Many loan words from these languages can be found in the Jordanian dialects, though not so much as English. However, students also have the option of learning French in schools. Currently, there is a small society of French speakers called Francophone and it is quite notable in the country. The language is also spoken by people who are interested in the cultural and commercial features of France.\n\n"}

Kitty introduced FBI Agent Avery Ryan from which this episode served as the backdoor pilot of the series. Despite being credited Jorja Fox and Jon Wellner who portray Sara Sidle and Henry Andrews do not appear in this episode (although the latter does appear in a deleted scene).\n\nThe episode begins with a house's security system being disabled. Then a dark figure walks into a bedroom and murders the woman in the bedroom. The scene cuts to Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) yelling orders at the police officers and trying to get rid of the press. Nick Stokes (George Eads) catches up with a suspect (Gil Bellows) and tests him for GSR which comes back positive so he is arrested. D.B. Russell (Ted Danson) enters the house and he notices that the technology seems to follow him and the lights turn on when he walks past them. Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) tells D.B. that he believes the house is a smart house. While Julie Finlay (Elisabeth Shue) is taking crime scene photos, Al Robbins (Robert David Hall) gives a brief belief of what he believes happened. When D.B. looks through the suspect's (revealed as the victim's husband Lee Berman) computer he notices a photo of a woman (Torrey DeVitto) but then the computer crashes. The scene cuts to Washington, D.C. where a woman (Avery Ryan, Patricia Arquette) from the FBI is sitting on the phone demanding a flight to Las Vegas because the Kitty case is involved in a murder.\n\nAt an airfield Avery arrives where a pilot complains about her wanting to stop at Vegas, she then tells the pilot things he doesn't like about himself and he quickly tells her that she can come.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Brass is interviewing Berman about his wife's murder. It is shown that Avery is watching the interview, Avery asks Conrad Ecklie (Marc Vann) if she can go in and interview. Avery starts to quiz Berman about Kitty. Berman demands his solicitors to leave the room but when Avery tells him that she knows when people are lying he calls his solicitors back in.\n\nD.B., Julie, Nick and David Hodges look for Kitty in the database, Avery explains about the deep web and then gets one of her agents to log into Kitty's website and they use Hodges' name to log in the site. Avery shows them that Kitty is just a chat bot.\n\nIn his office, Avery talks to D.B. about the case and requests Finlay to assist her to review the computer. Avery manages to retrieve the data from Berman's computer and they learn that there was a two-way camera on the computer. Avery and Finlay conclude that Berman unknowingly made a sex tape. Avery notices Kitty massaging her jaw and investigates further.\n\nIn the morgue, David Phillips (David Berman) gives D.B. a bullet. while Robbins is performing the autopsy.\n\nMorgan Brody (Elisabeth Harnois) tells D.B. that the bullet found doesn't match Berman's bullets. Berman is then released from custody and he walks past the police station reception and sees a woman (also DeVitto) who is identical to Kitty. Avery explains to the woman (whose name is Susan) that she is a person of interest. Susan tells Avery that she is on Friend Agenda. Avery notes to Susan that she has an \"idiosyncratic medical condition\".\n\nAvery and Susan work out that Susan's top hit on her profile is the one who created Kitty. Meanwhile, Ecklie tells Berman to stay at the hotel where he learns that Berman doesn't have a dog so Nick takes the dog to Hodges while Greg is briefing how the killer knew the house. The three learn that the killer got a dog to fool the security at the house.\n\nBrass finds the car rented by the killer and he and Nick go to the car where it was empty as a plane flies overhead they realize the killer has fled the country. Nick takes the evidence back to the office and briefs D.B. and Avery. There was a video of the murder where Avery realizes that her suspect was never in Las Vegas.\n\nAvery and Nick look at Nebula1's (Cheyenne Jackson) first profile picture, and learn that he is agoraphobic and orders in a lot. They then learn that he is in St Louis due to them being able to make out the Gateway Arch in the background. When FBI agents raid his house they find computers with Kitty on them all and then Avery realizes it is a trap and they lose all evidence.\n\nAvery organises a press conference where Susan tells her story. After the conference Avery is informed that Nebula1 has crashed Susan's profile.\n\nIn San Diego, Avery confronts Nebula1, he then attacks Avery and cuts her with his knife. Avery says her code word and he is then arrested.\n\nAt the end, Avery arranges for Susan's husband to come home. As she is leaving Avery tells D.B. about a bank robbery of three cents from 80 million chequing accounts.\n\nThis episode launched the third \"CSI\" series, \"\". It is written by the creators of \"CSI: Miami\" and \"CSI: NY\", and marks the first appearance of Patricia Arquette as Dr Avery Ryan.\n\nThis episode was included in the Season 14 DVD.\n\nThis episode is also included in \"CSI: Cyber\"s season 1 DVD boxset.\n\nThe episode had 9.95 million viewers.

{"id": "12471978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12471978", "title": "Koreans in Peru", "text": "Koreans in Peru\n\nKoreans in Peru () formed Latin America's seventh-largest Korean diaspora community , according to the statistics of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They are relatively small in size compared to the other Asian communities in Peru.\n\nThe first Korean migrant to Peru is believed to have been Park Man-bok, who was invited to Peru to coach the women's national volleyball team in 1972. Under his tutelage, the team would go on to a variety of successes in the 1980s, culminating in the winning of a silver medal for their country at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.\n\nHowever, few of Park's countrymen joined him in Peru; as late as 1985, there were only nine Korean families resident in the country, totalling 27 individuals. A large portion did not come directly from Korea, but had instead first settled in Bolivia, Paraguay, or Chile. The population began to increase in 1993, as the economic and social situation in Peru stabilised; during the 1990s, roughly two or three new Korean families arrived in Peru every month. However, after 1997, their population fell by nearly 56% from 1,774 to just 788 by 2005, largely due to outward migration to Mexico and Guatemala in 1998 and 1999; some of those who had arrived via Chile also returned there.\n\nBy 2011, Peru's Korean population had recovered slightly to 1,305. According to South Korean government statistics, 24 took up Peruvian nationality, 342 stayed in Peru as permanent residents, 30 were international students, and the remaining 909 had other kinds of visas.\n\nThe economic profile of the Korean community in Peru is widely varied and has continued to shift over the years. In the 1980s, many were involved in calamari fishing. The roughly 900 Koreans resident in Peru in 2001 included among their number 500 business people, 90 representatives of the South Korean government, 48 factory owners, 39 religious workers, and 25 sportspeople. Many businesspeople are involved in the import of products from South Korea, especially used cars, computers, and construction equipment; however, the largest portion of Koreans in Peru are involved with the textile industry.\n\nAside from Park Man-bok, other Koreans have made notable contributions to sport in Peru. Lee Ki-Hyung, a 1973 taekwondo world champion, went on to work as a martial arts instructor in the Peruvian Air Force. Chung Eui-Hwang, 9th dan black belt, arrived in Peru in 1979, and from then until 1989 trained the Military Academy of Chorrillos, the Peruvian Commando Special Forces, the Technical Academy of the Military, and the First Brigade of the Special Forces. These efforts began the trend of popularisation of taekwondo in Peru, which grew to 30,000 practitioners .\n\nDespite the small size of its Korean population, Peru was the site of a major precedent for Korean immigrants' political integration when the city of Chanchamayo, Junín elected Mario Jung (정흥원, also spelled Mario Yung) as its mayor in 2011. Jung thus became the first mayor of Korean descent not just in Peru but in all of South America, even though neighbouring countries such as Brazil have larger Korean populations and a much longer history of migration from Korea. Jung, a South Korean citizen, had originally settled in Argentina in 1986 before coming to Peru in 1996. Politically, Jung is a supporter of Fujimorism, and was known locally for his charitable work with the poor. Peruvian law requires that the president and members of Congress be Peruvian citizens, but does not place any requirements on lower-level politicians. Jung's inauguration was attended by South Korean consul Lee You-bum on behalf of ambassador Han Byung-kil.\n\nUnlike the surrounding population, many Koreans in Peru are Protestant rather than Catholic. The largest Korean church in Peru, the Iglesia Evangélica Coreana, claims roughly 250 attendees. However, Korean Catholics in Peru also have a parish devoted to them, the Parroquia San Andrés Kim, named for the Korean saint Andrew Kim Taegon.\n"}
{"id": "20871195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20871195", "title": "LGBT people in prison", "text": "LGBT people in prison\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) prisoners often face additional challenges compared to non-LGBT prisoners. According to Just Detention International, LGBT inmates are \"among the most vulnerable in the prison population\". 67% of LGBT prisoners in California report being assaulted while in prison. The vulnerability of LGBT prisoners has led some prisons to separate them from other prisoners, while in others they are housed with the general population.\n\nWhile much of the available data on LGBT inmates comes from the United States, Amnesty International maintains records of known incidents internationally in which LGBT prisoners and those perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have suffered torture, ill-treatment and violence at the hands of fellow inmates as well as prison officials.\n\nMany LGBT inmates who are able, even those who are openly gay outside of prison, stay in the closet with their sexual identities while imprisoned, because inmates who are known or perceived as gay, especially lesbians and gay men with stereotypically butch or effeminate characteristics, respectively, face \"a very high risk of sexual abuse\".\n\nDenial of access to surgical sex reassignment on the grounds of unstable or criminal behaviour condemns those who are transsexual. Resulting in potential continuing identity confusion, low self-esteem, drug and alcohol abuse, self-mutilation and acting out behaviour. Which further facilitates the vicious cycle of chronic dysfunction, which perpetuates criminal behaviour.\n\nMany transgender prisoners need resources and support, and much work remains to be done. Some organizations that used to focus on women's issues have expanded to include transgender people and gender non-conforming people in their work. Certain actions can and do improve the lives of trans prisoners. The papers \"Transitioning Our Prisons Toward Affirmative Law: Examining the Impact of Gender Classification Policies on U.S. Transgender Prisoners\" and \"The Treatment of Transgender Prisoners, Not Just an American Problem – A Comparative Analysis of American, Australian, and Canadian Prison Policies Concerning the Treatment of Transgender Prisoners and a 'Universal' Recommendation To Improve Treatment\" maintain that individuals should always be addressed and placed based on their gender identity rather than their genitalia.\n\nIn 2010 it was reported that Italy was to open its first transgender prison at Pozzale, a decision welcomed by gay rights groups.\n\nThe bill mentioned in \"Transgender Prisoners: A Critical Analysis of Queensland Corrective Services' New Procedure\" has shown to be largely ineffective.\n\nTransgender prisoners are vulnerable in U.S. prisons due to a general policy of housing them according to their birth-assigned gender or genital configuration (i.e. post-op trans women would be placed in women's prisons), regardless of their current appearance or gender identity. Transgender women with breasts may be locked up with men, leaving them vulnerable to violence and sexual assault, as occurred with the case of Dee Farmer, a pre-operative transgender woman with breast implants, who was raped and contracted HIV when she was housed in a men's prison. Transgender men housed in women's prisons also face abuse, often more from guards than other inmates.\n\nAccess to hormone replacement therapy, appropriate psychological counseling, bras, and other supportive underclothing helps individuals to live as the gender that they self-identify with. Some courts in the US have ruled that it is a necessary medical treatment to provide hormone therapy for transgender prisoners. California Medical Facility, Vacaville, provides this medical treatment for male-to-female prisoners.\n\nIn May 2018, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons announced a reversion of its guidelines. Previously, transgender prisoners would be housed according to the gender with which they identify. Now, housing will once again be determined by biological sex.\n\nOn November 14, 2013, Harris County, Texas adopted an LGBT inmate policy. This policy is intended to protect and assure equal treatment of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender inmates. This allows individuals to be housed based on the gender they identify with instead of their biological sex. The policy also outlines how inmates will be searched. It includes a \"safe zone project\" that will endorse a \"positive relationship of solidarity\" connecting the sheriff's department and the gay community. Another important policy states that members of the transgender community will be referred to by their chosen name, even if it has not legally been changed, both when spoken to and on their identifications bracelets. The sheriff's office in Harris County has a training and certification program for staff members to become a \"gender classification specialist\" and have authorization to hold discussions with inmates about gender issues.\n\nIn 2011, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 35% of black transgender Americans have been incarcerated simply due to perceived anti-trans bias, compared to 4% of white transgender respondents. Black transgender people had higher rates of experiences of incarceration in general (47% compared to 12% of white transgender people). It also found that black trans women were sexually assaulted in jail at a rate of 38%, compared to 12% of white trans women prisoners.\n\nIn 2002 Dean Spade, a lawyer who is also transgender, founded the Sylvia Rivera Law Project which provides free legal services and uses education to end institutional discrimination against transgender people. The Sylvia Rivera Law Project runs the Prison Rights Project, which 'supports low income transgender people and transgender people of color involuntarily held in prison, jail, lock-up and immigration detention obtain life-sustaining services'.\n\nA conjugal visit is a scheduled extended visit during which an inmate of a prison is permitted to spend several hours or days in private with visitors, usually family members, in special rooms, trailers or even decorated, apartment-like settings on prison grounds. While the parties may engage in sexual intercourse, in practice an inmate may have several visitors, including children, as the generally recognized basis for permitting such a visit is to preserve family bonds and increase the chances of success for a prisoner's eventual return to life outside prison. Laws on conjugal visits vary widely by country from a total prohibition to very permissive policies. In jurisdictions where there is some form of recognition of same-sex relationships, prisoners may be permitted conjugal visits with a same-sex partner. In the United States, conjugal visits are allowed only in four states: California, Connecticut, New York and Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Masen Davis, Executive Director of the Transgender Law Center, LGBT people in prisons often face barriers in seeking basic and necessary medical treatment, exacerbated by the fact that prison health care staff are often not aware of or trained on how to address those needs. For example, like Michelle Kosilek did in May 2006, two transgender prisoners filed suit in January 2008 challenging a Wisconsin law that bars inmates from receiving hormones or sex reassignment surgery notwithstanding Principle 9 of The Yogyakarta Principles. The significance of the Yogyakarta Principles is also stressed by \"Handbook on prisoners with special needs\" published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nHowever, on August 31, 2001, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal concluded that Sections 30 and 31 of the Correctional Service of Canada contained discrimination on the basis of sex and disability in Canadian Human Rights Act. after Synthia Kavanagh, a transwoman sentenced for life in 1989 for 2nd-degree murder, was sent to an institution for males. This institution assignment occurred despite the trial judge's recommendation that Synthia, as a transwoman, serve her sentence in a facility for women. Further, Synthia was denied sex reassignment surgery and hormones. The institutional policy, at the time, only facilitated cases which addressed conditions in which, reasonably, the plaintiff would seek sexual reassignment after the period of incarceration. Due to Synthia Kavanagh's life sentence, this was not a foreseeable option. \"The decision to discontinue hormones in 1990 seems to have been based on the complainant's life sentence which made her, according to Dr. R. Dickey, apparently ineligible for ultimate reassignment. ... the diagnosis of transsexualism has been clearly established in this case\" by expert witness testimony, throughout her trial, \"She [had] responded well to feminizing effects of cross-gender hormones and has experienced no significant side effects. As established by legal precedent and confirmed by policy in Canadian and British Columbia Corrections Service, the complainant was entitled to continue her hormone treatment\".\n\nIn Petitioning the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, Kavanagh argued that \"The Correctional Service of Canada has discriminated and continues to discriminate against me because of my disability and sex (Transsexualism), contrary to Section 5 of the Canadian Human Right Act, by refusing to provide me with necessary medical and surgical treatment.\" Kavanagh continues to elaborate on her transition prior to imprisonment in this address, stating \"since 1981 I have been diagnosed as a transsexual, which means that my gender is female but my sex is male. For 13 years, I was on estrogen hormonal treatment and lived as a woman, in preparation for my sex reassignment surgery to correct my medical disorder. In May 1990, my hormonal treatment was discontinued.\" After incarceration in a men's facility Kavanagh \"repeatedly asked the CSC to arrange for evaluation for sex reassignment surgery, for the surgery to be performed and my consequent transfer to a women's institution.\" The discontinuation of hormone treatment and rejection of proposed sex reassignment surgery, paired with the continuation of periods of solitude prompted Kavanagh to respond \"I believe that the CSC Policy discriminates against transsexuals, as the policy does not recognize the need for the continuation of medical treatment at the onset of incarceration, nor does the policy acknowledge the psychological need to be imprisoned with other members of one's psychological sex at the time of incarceration.\"\n\nIndividuals with relatively short prison sentences the requirement of completing the life trial within society does not seem unreasonable. Prison is not generally an appropriate setting for transsexual individuals to make decisions which are irreversible. The implications of refusing access to surgical reassignment for individuals with a life sentence or prolonged incarceration are however clearly more serious. For example, the Canadian Correctional Service in the Pacific Region alone had six transsexual inmates as of September 1994 with sentences of nine years or over and three with life imprisonment.\n\nThe consequences of discontinued sex-reassignment procedure are especially evident in the cases of those subject to substantial prison sentencing. The Canadian Correctional Service in the Pacific Region alone had six transsexual inmates as of September 1994 with sentences of nine years or over and three with life imprisonment.\n\nAccording to some studies, LGBT youth are particularly at risk for arrest and detention. Jody Marksamer, Shannan Wilber, and Katayoon Majd, writing on behalf of the Equity Project, a collaboration between Legal Services for Children, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the National Juvenile Defender Center, say that LGBT youth are overrepresented in the populations of youth who are at risk of arrest and of those who are confined in juvenile justice facilities in the United States.\n\nA brief by the Center for American Progress found that each year approximately 300,000 gay, trans, and gender nonconforming youth are arrested or detained each year, 60% of whom are Black or Hispanic. These queer youth make up 13–15 percent of the juvenile incarceration system, compared to their overall population of 5–7 percent. Similar to how transgender adults are often placed into solitary confinement, allegedly for their own protection, these youth are \"protected\" in the same way. Often, however, it is because they are seen as sexual predators rather than potential victims. Courts also commonly assign queer youth to sex offender treatment programs even when convicted of a non-sexual crime.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, globally, LGBT prisoners and those perceived to be LGBT, are at risk of torture, ill-treatment and violence from other inmates as well as prison officials. Amnesty International cites numerous cases internationally where LGBT inmates are known to have been abused or murdered by prison officials or fellow inmates.\n\nStatistics show that 59% of transgender women in male prisons had been sexually assaulted while incarcerated compared to the 4% of the male-identified population. Transgender women in male prisons also deal with the risk of forced prostitution by both prison staff and other prisoners. Forced prostitution can occur when a correction officer brings a transgender woman to the cell of a male inmate and locks them in so that the male inmate can rape her. The male inmate will then pay the correction officer in some way and sometimes the correction officer will give the woman a portion of the payment.\n\n\"[P]risoners fitting any part of the following description are more likely to be targeted: young, small in size, physically weak, gay, first offender, possessing \"feminine\" characteristics such as long hair or a high voice; being unassertive, unaggressive, shy, intellectual, not street-smart, or \"passive\"; or having been convicted of a sexual offense against a minor. Prisoners with any one of these characteristics typically face an increased risk of sexual abuse, while prisoners with several overlapping characteristics are much more likely than other prisoners to be targeted for abuse.\"\n\nGay and bisexual men are often assumed to be responsible for the preponderance of sexual assaults perpetrated in prisons as has been reflected in various American judicial decisions. For example, in \"Cole v. Flick\" the court upheld the right of prisons to limit the length of inmates' hair, claiming that allowing them to wear long hair could lead to an increase in attacks by \"predatory homosexuals\". In \"Roland v. Johnson\", the court described \"gangs of homosexual predators\". And \"Ashann-Ra v. Virginia\" contains references to \"inmates known to be predatory homosexuals [stalking] other inmates in the showers\". According to a study by Human Rights Watch, however, \"The myth of the 'homosexual predator' is groundless. Perpetrators of rape typically view themselves as heterosexual and, outside of the prison environment, prefer to engage in heterosexual activity. Although gay inmates are much more likely than other inmates to be victimized in prison, they are not likely to be perpetrators of sexual abuse.\" (see also situational homosexuality)\n\nA related problem is that there is a tendency, among both prison officials and prisoners, to view victimization as proof of homosexuality: \"The fact of submitting to rape—even violent, forcible rape—redefines [a prisoner] as 'a punk, sissy, queer.'\" Officials sometimes take the view all sex involving a gay prisoner is necessarily consensual, meaning that victims known or perceived to be gay may not receive necessary medical treatment, protection, and legal recourse, and perpetrators may go unpunished and remain able to perpetrate abuse on their victims:\n\nAccording to Andrea Cavanaugh Kern, a spokesperson for Stop Prisoner Rape, the combination of high rates of sexual assault against gay prisoners and high rates of HIV infection in the prison population is \"a life-or-death issue for the LGBT community\".\n\nWhile much of the data regards male prisoners, according to Amnesty International, \"perceived or actual sexual orientation has been found to be one of four categories that make a female prisoner a more likely target for sexual abuse\".\n\nFor their own safety, LGBT people in prison are sometimes placed in administrative segregation or protective custody. Although homosexuality is \"generally regarded as a factor supporting an inmate's claim to protective custody\", homophobia among prison officials and a misperception among many guards that \"when a gay inmate has sex with another man it is somehow by definition consensual\" mean that access to such custody is not always easy or available.\n\nAnother problem is that protective and disciplinary custody are often the same, which means that prisoners in \"protective housing\" are often held with the most violent inmates in highly restrictive and isolated settings—sometimes in more or less permanent lockdown or solitary confinement—that prevent them from participating in drug treatment, education and job-training programs, from having contact with other prisoners or outside visitors, or from enjoying privileges such as the right to watch television, listen to the radio, or even to leave their cells. The degree of safety that protective custody provides depends on the facilities. Protective custody can provide a secure environment that is free from violence by other prisoners or it can isolate prisoners, and position them with a higher risk of violence by a correctional officer. Although the protective custody can offer some level of protection, the harmful physical and psychological impacts of isolation show that it is an unwanted alternative to assignment in the general population.\n\nIn other cases, institutions may have special areas (known by such nicknames as the \"queerentine\", \"gay tank\", \"queen tank\", or \"softie tank\") for housing vulnerable inmates such as LGBT people, elderly or disabled prisoners, or informers. In San Francisco, for example, transgender inmates are automatically segregated from other prisoners. Nevertheless, according to Eileen Hirst, San Francisco Sheriff's Chief of Staff, being gay is not in itself enough to justify a request for protective housing: inmates requesting such housing must demonstrate that they are vulnerable.\n\nFor financial or other reasons segregated housing is not always available. For instance at Rikers Island, New York City's largest jail, the segregated unit for LGBT prisoners, known as \"gay housing\", was closed in December 2005 citing a need to improve security. The unit had opened in the 1970s due to concerns about abuse of LGBT prisoners in pretrial detention. The New York City Department of Corrections' widely criticised plan was to restructure the classification of prisoners and create a new protective custody system which would include 23-hour-per-day lockdown (identical to that mandated for disciplinary reasons) or moving vulnerable inmates to other facilities. Whereas formerly all that was required was a declaration of homosexuality or the appearance of being transgender, inmates wanting protective custody would now be required to request it in a special hearing.\n\nSolitary confinement has become the prison system's preferred method to protect transgender inmates from other prisoners in cases involving sexual assault, harassment and physical violence. Advocates for transgender prisoners argue that this method only increases the harassment they receive from officers and various other staff members as reported by Injustice at Every Turn. In the report, 44% of transgender male respondents and 40% of transgender women respondents who were imprisoned reported being harassed by officers and/or other staff members of the prison system. While in solitary confinement, transgender individuals are less likely to receive medical care.\n\nIn cases where the incarcerated are assigned to prisons based on sex, rather than their gender-identity, complete segregation is often seen as the only viable way for ensuring safety. In the case of Synthia Kavanagh, she was assigned to a male institution despite explicit recommendations from the trial judge. As a result, Kavanagh was \"placed in segregation over extended periods of her incarceration for the purpose of protection from self-harm or abuse by others. Segregation for prolonged periods is not only inhuman but [is additionally] unconducive to any prospect of stabilization or rehabilitation.\"\n\nOut of the respondents in the same report 12% of transgender individuals surveyed reported being denied routine non-transition related healthcare and 17% reported being denied hormone treatment. The number was disproportionately higher when transgender people of color reported lack of transition health care and hormone treatment with American Indians reporting 36% denial and Black and/or African American reporting a 30% denial rate. The use of solitary confinement also lessens transgender inmate's access to programs and work assignments where they may be able to lessen their sentences, enter rehabilitation programs, or earn money to buy basic products such as soap and also lesses their chances to obtain parole or conditional release.\n\nSolitary confinement has also shown to affect the mental health of transgender prisoners. With the report of filed by Injustice at Every Turn, 41% of respondents reported attempted suicide. With transgender people of color, 56% of American Indian and 54% of multiracial individuals reported attempted suicide. The report also links the over-use of solitary confinement as a factor in the high rate of suicide attempts by transgender people of color within the prison system.\n\nAs a result of the rise of awareness of LGBT persons in prisons, many organizations have developed specifically to support LGBT people in the prison system. These organizations address the various needs surrounding specific issues that LGBT persons in the prison system face. Some organizations also support family members of LGBTQ inmates.\n\nBlack and Pink is an American organization that is composed of \"LGBTQ prisoners and 'free world' allies\" who focus on prison abolishment movement and support LGBTQ prison inmates and their families. The organization offers various services such as court accompaniment, a pen pal program, workshops and training, and support for LGBTQ persons who are experiencing sexual violence, harassment, or lack of health care.\n\n"}

They speak the Lampung language, a Lampungic language estimated to have 1.5 million speakers.\n\nThe origins of the Lampung people is closely tied to the name of Lampung itself. In the 7th century the Chinese had already mentioned about a place in the south (\"Nampang\") where it is said to be the place of the \"Tolang Pohwang\" kingdom. \"To\" means \"people\" and \"Lang Pohwang\" means \"Lampung\". Hence its name \"Tolang Pohwang\" which means \"Lampung people\" or \"envoy from Lampung\" that came from China until the 7th century. There are strong evidence that Lampung was part of the Srivijaya kingdom with its capital in Jambi and did conquered parts of South East Asia region including Lampung until the 11th century.\n\nIn the 5th AD \"Tai-Ping-Huan-Yu-Chi\" chronicles, names of the \"Nan-hai\" (Southern ocean) states were recorded and among them are two states which were mentioned in sequence, \"To-lang\" and \"Po-hwang\". The \"To-lang\" state was mentioned only once, but the \"Po-hwang\" state was mentioned many times as this state did sent envoys to China in the year of 442, 449, 451, 459, 464 and 466. According to Prof. Gabriel Ferrand (1918), it is likely that the name \"To-lang\" and \"Po-hwang\" are actually one same name and is located in Tulangbawang, Lampung.\n\nIt is said that there is also a Tulangbawang kingdom, although the idea simply came from the unification of the two names in the Chinese chronicles.\n\nThe earlier generation of the Lampung people came from Sekala Brak, at the foot of Mount Pesagi, West Lampung Regency. Its people were inhabited by the \"Buay Tumil\" people and they were ruled by a woman named Ratu Sekerummong. The religion of the people is animism mixed with the Javanese Bairawa Hinduism influences. After the 15th century, the Buay Tumil people later had influences from four Muslim men who came from Pagaruyung Kingdom, West Sumatra that went there. They are Umpu Bejalan Diway, Umpu Nyerupa, Umpu Pernong and Umpu Belunguh. The fourth men is the forerunner of Paksi Pak Sekala Brak as it is mentioned in an ancient manuscript, Kuntara Raja Niti. However, in the Kuntara Raja Niti manuscript, their names are Inder Gajah, Pak Lang, Sikin, Belunguh, and Indarwati. Based on the Kuntara Raja Niti, the hypothesis of the descendants of the Lampung people are as the following:\nOriginally the lineage of the Lampung people came from Sekala Brak. However, in its customary sense the Lampung people developed and became two people group, namely the Saibatin Lampungs and the Pepadun Lampungs. The customs of the Saibatin people are well known for its aristocracy, while the customs of the Pepadun people which emerged later followed the practices of the Abung people and had democracy values developed in opposed to the aristocracy values held by the Saibatin people.\n\nThe Saibatin Lampungs occupy traditional regions such as Labuhan Maringgai, Pugung, Jabung, Way Jepara, Kalianda, Raja Basa, Teluk Betung, Padang Cermin, Cukuh Balak, Way Lima, Talang Padang, Kota Agung, Semaka, Suoh, Sekincau, Batu Brak, Belalau, Liwa, Pesisir Krui, Ranau, Martapura, Muara Dua, Kayu Agung with four of these cities are in South Sumatra province, Cikoneng in Pantai Banten and including Merpas in South Bengkulu Regency. The Saibatin Lampungs are also often referred to as Pesisir (coastal) Lampungs because majority of them lived along the east, south and west coast of Lampung with each consisting of:-\n\nThe Pepadun Lampungs or Pedalaman (interior) Lampungs consists of:-\n\nThe philosophical life of the Lampung people are contained in the Kuntara Raja Niti manuscript, which are:-\n\nThe above-mentioned philosophical values are denoted by the symbol of five decorative flowers of the Lampung seal.\n\nThe characteristic traits of the Lampung people are expressed in the \"adi-adi\" (poems):-\n\"Tandani ulun Lampung, wat piil-pusanggiri\"\n\"Mulia heno sehitung, wat liom ghega dighi\"\n\"Juluk-adok gham pegung, nemui-nyimah muaghi\"\n\"Nengah-nyampugh mak ngungkung, sakai-Sambaian gawi.\"\n\nThe Lampung language is the language used by the Lampung people in Lampung, southern Palembang and the west coast of Banten. This language is classified in its own branch from the western Malayo-Polynesian languages (Lampungic languages) and is still closely related to Malay and Sundanese and distantly related to Javanese. The Lampung language has two major dialects which is Api and Nyo dialects. The Api dialect are spoken by the people of Sekala Brak, Melinting Maringgai, Darah Putih Rajabasa, Balau Telukbetung, Semaka Kota Agung, Pesisir Krui, Ranau, Komering and Daya (those that practices the Saibatin Lampungs customs), and including Way Kanan, Sungkai and Pubian (those that practices Pepadun Lampungs customs). The Nyo dialect are used by the people of Abung and Tulangbawang (those that practices Pepadun Lampungs customs). According to Dr. Van Royen, there are two classification of the Lampung language which are the Belalau dialect or Api dialect and the Abung dialect or Nyo dialect. Komering, spoken by the Komering is also part of Lampungic languages but mostly considered an independent language of its own, separate from proper Lampung as the Komering people have a different culture from Lampung people.\n\nLampung script that is referred to as \"Had Lampung\" is a form of writing that is related to the Pallawa script from South India. Just like a form of syllable-based phonetic writing similar to the vowels as used in Arabic letters by using the sign of fathah at the top row and the sign of kasrah at the bottom row but does not use the sign of dammah on the front row unless the mark is used at the back, with each mark has its own name.\n\nThis shows that Lampung script is influenced by two elements, namely the Pallawa script and Arabic script. The Lampung script also has a form of kinship with Rencong script, Rejang script, Bengkulu script and Bugis script. Had Lampung consists of main letters, sub-letters, double letters and consonant clusters, as well as also symbols, numbers and punctuation. Lampung script is also referred to as KaGaNga, a term for a script that is written and read in a direction from left to right with 20 main letters.\n\nLampung script has developed or changed. Previous ancient Lampung script is much more complex. Refinement were made until it has become to what it is now known. The Lampung script or alphabet that is being taught in the school today is the result of that refinement.\n\nStatesmen and politicians:\n\nProfessional practitioners:\n\nArtists and humanists:\n\nAcademicians and educationist:\n\nReporters and journalists:\n\nHeros of freedom fighters:\n\n"}

Party leader and former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan as well as 68 party officials received prison sentences after a court trial, although the former's was commuted to house arrest.\n\nThe Welfare Party, an Islamist political party in Turkey founded and led by Necmettin Erbakan (1926–2011), had received grants from the Treasury in accordance with the applicable laws. In June 1998, the coalition cabinet of Erbakan was forced to resign following the submission of a memorandum by the military on February 28, 1998. The same year, the Constitutional Court banned the Welfare Party on the grounds that it tried to overthrow Turkey's secular system and to promote Islamic fundamentalism. Erbakan was suspended from active politics for a term of five years. The bans were upheld by the European Court of Human Rights as well.\n\nThe Treasury requested the return of the financial aid worth around one trillion lira, i.e. one million in today's currency (around 477,000) from the then-closed RP. The party executives declared that the funds were spent on party activities. However, an investigation found that the amount was converted into 10 million Deutsche Mark and was then deposited in Yapı ve Kredi Bankası. Early in 1997, the amount was withdrawn from the bank.\n\nIn the beginning of 1999, Erbakan and 78 party members were prosecuted by the First High Penal Court of Sincan in Ankara. They were accused of embezzling trillions by forging 139 official party documents with the intention to hide the grants, which the Treasury ordered back. The case became known as the \"Lost Trillion Case\" or the \"Missing Trillion Case\" (). Among the defendants were prominent politicians like Şevket Kazan, former Minister of Justice, and Ahmet Tekdal, co-founder and first leader of the party.\n\nIn March 2002, Erbakan received a prison sentence of two years and four months. The court convicted 68 party officials to sentences of up to one year and two months in prison. The court's decision was approved by the Supreme Court of Appeals.\n\nAbdullah Gül, who was the vice chairman of the party responsible for foreign affairs, joined another Islamist party, the Virtue Party (, FP), in 1998. He was re-elected into the parliament in 1999. His parliamentary immunity at the time of the trial spared him from prosecution.\n\nErbakan's imprisonment was adjourned four times as he submitted medical reports about his poor health condition. The last adjournment took place in July 2005 for six month time. After the end of the term, he applied for the re-opening of his case, which was rejected in first and second instance. In April 2006, the Supreme Court of Appeals annulled the court's decision from March 2002. In accordance with the in-the-meantime-amended law, the court reduced Erbakan's sentence to eleven months and two days in house arrest.\n\nErbakan began to serve his sentence at his summer residence in Altınoluk of Edremit, Balıkesir in house arrest on May 2008. Upon his application of pardoning, Abdullah Gül, at that time the President of Turkey, pardoned Erbakan on permanent health grounds in August 2008.\n\nAbdullah Gül had been exempted from the trial due to his parliamentary immunity. Later, as he became state president in August 2007, he could not be brought before the court as, according to the Constitution, presidents may not be tried for any allegations other than treason. The re-opened case in 2008 referred to him as a \"suspect\". He expressed his willingness to appear before the court. However, the case remained for him frozen until the end of his presidency term in August 2014.\n\nThe criminal court in Ankara decreed that Gül testifies for charges of falsifying official documents as the crime was committed before his presidency. Judicial experts are of the opinion that he would have been acquiıtted even he was tried because his responsibilities in the party were not of financial nature. As an example, RP officials Şevket Kazan, Recai Kutan, Oğuzhan Asiltürk, the deputy chairman and even the general accountant were all acquitted in the past.\n\nGül announced his readiness to testify in the \"Lost Trillion Case\" right after he handed over his post as state president in late August. In November 2014, he testified before the court with the motive of \"having justice operate flawlessly and seamlessly\" and \"in order not to leave any doubt on any issue\".\n\nOn December 6, 2014, the Head Public Prosecutor of Ankara announced its conclusion in the case as nolle prosequi (\"unwilling to pursue\") due to missing evidence required for a public lawsuit.\n"}

Their population is estimated to be about 300,000 in Chad. Other estimates place the total number of Maba people in north-Central Africa to be about 700,000.\n\nThe Maba today primarily adhere to Islam, following the Maliki Sunni denomination. They supported the Sultans of Abeche and the Sudanic kingdoms, who spoke their language. Little is certain about their history before the 17th century. They are noted as having helped expel the Christian Tunjur dynasty and installed an Islamic dynasty in their region in the early 17th-century. Their homelands lie in the path of caravan routes that connect the Sahel and West Africa with the Middle East. The Maba people are an Arabized African people, who descend from Ham in the Bible and Arab mixture. They are traditionally pastoral and farmers who are clan-oriented.\n\nThe Maba people have also been referred to as the Wadai, a derivative of Ouaddaï. They speak Maba, a Nilo-Saharan language, of the Maban branch. Locally this language is called \"Bura Mabang\". The first ten numerals in Maba language, states Andrew Dalby, are \"tek, bar, kungal, asal, tor, settal, mindri, rya, adoi, atuk\", and this is very distant from other Nilo-Saharan languages. Although a small ethnic group, their Maba language was the state language of the Islamic state of Wadai, and continued to be an important language when the Islamic Bornu Empire conquered these lands. Many Maba people also speak Arabic, as their traditional trade language.\n\nThe Maba people rebelled against the tribute demands of the Bornu Empire, and became sovereign people. They then led raids to southern regions for plunder and slaves from non-Muslim African ethnic groups. The African slaves of the Maba people were absorbed in the Maba tribal culture, and often they converted to escape slavery. In the 19th century, a powerful Maba Sultanate on slave trading caravan route emerged under rulers such as Muhammad al-Sharif and Doud Murra. The Maba Sultanate was abolished by the French in 1912, and the Maba people's region thereafter annexed into the Ubangi-Shari colony. The Mabas participated in the efforts to end the colonial rule and then in the civil wars in Chad.\n\nThe Maba people are subdivided into many sub-clans, each controlling certain grazing lands and sources of water. Among the various sub-clans, the largest are the \"Marfa\", \"Djene\" and \"Mandaba\".\n\n"}

It was commonly known as \"pedopartij\" (\"pedo party\") in the media, due to its advocacy for legalization of child pornography and the lowering of the age of consent to age 12. PNVD was founded on 31 May 2006 by three self-described pedophiles. Its motto is \"sapere aude\" (\"Have courage to use your own reason\"). PNVD has not participated in any election. In 2006, it did not receive the 30 signatures from each of the 19 Dutch electoral regions it would need to get on the ballot for the 2006 elections. Since 14 March 2010 the party no longer exists.\n\nAccording to their official statement, the PNVD's platform aimed to maximize diversity and liberty. They proposed allowing individuals, from the age of 12, to vote, have sex, gamble, choose their place of residence, and use soft drugs. Hard drugs would be legal at 16, as that would be the new age of majority. They also intended to eliminate marriage in the law, permit public nudity anywhere in the country, make railway travel free, and institute a comprehensive animal rights platform. They were opposed to immigration and religious elementary schools.\n\nThe PNVD sought to have the legal age of consent lowered to 12, and, in the long run, completely eliminated (except in dependent or intrafamilial relationships). They reason that only \"coerced\" or \"dangerous\" sexual activity should be punished. They also aimed to equalize the legal age where one can perform in pornography with the legal age of consent. Prostitution would be legal at the age of 16. The PNVD wanted to legalise private use of child pornography (calling outlawing thereof \"censorship\" in the platform) and allow non-violent pornography to be screened on daytime television. Their platform also included legalization of humans engaging in sex with animals.\n\nTreasurer Van den Berg claimed that, \"Rearing is also about introducing children to sex\". Because of their controversial viewpoints on children and sexuality, they were often called the \"paedo-party\" by the people and in the media.\n\nAlso, the party's platform called for separate imprisonment facilities for sex offenders, arguing that the country would otherwise have indirect torture laws.\n\nThe PNVD ultimately aimed to establish a universal treaty guaranteeing all animals basic rights.\n\nIn addition, the party planned to heavily restrict animal testing and completely prohibit the consumption of meat and fish: they viewed the killing of animals, no matter what purpose it serves, as murder. Industries currently depending on the sale of animal meat would receive provisional financial support from the government. Hunting and fishing for sport would also be banned. The party also supported laws criminalizing the \"sexual maltreatment\" of animals.\n\nMultiple positions taken by the PNVD were controversial, especially those concerning children. In a May 2006 opinion poll, 82% of respondents wanted the Dutch government to stop the party from competing in the elections. The anti-pedophile foundation \"Soelaas\" petitioned the courts to ban the party, but the judges ruled in the PNVD's\nfavour. \"The freedom of expression, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of association … should be seen as the foundations of the democratic rule of law and the PNVD is also entitled to these freedoms,\" the court said in a statement.\nThe party's ties to paedophile activism have also drawn much attention: Marthijn Uittenbogaard (who also starred in the controversial documentary \"Are All Men Pedophiles?\") was earlier the treasurer of Vereniging MARTIJN, an organization which advocates romantic and sexual relationships between adults and children, and all of its founders have identified as pedophiles.

{"id": "970642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=970642", "title": "Portuguese people", "text": "Portuguese people\n\nPortuguese people are a Romance ethnic group indigenous to Portugal that share a common Portuguese culture and speak Portuguese. Their predominant religion is Christianity, mainly Roman Catholicism, though vast segments of the population, especially the younger generations, have no religious affiliation. Historically, the Portuguese people's heritage includes the pre-Celts and Celts (Celtiberians, Lusitanians, Gallaecians, Oestriminis, Turduli and Celtici) - from whom the majority of the population descends.\n\nThen the Romans, Greeks, Scandinavians, migratory Germanic tribes like the Suebi, Vandals, Visigoths (Western Goths) and Buri who settled in what is today's Portugal\nThe Roman Republic conquered the Iberian Peninsula during the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. from the extensive maritime empire of Carthage during the series of Punic Wars. As a result of Roman colonization, the majority of local languages stem from the Vulgar Latin. Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the Portuguese Empire and the subsequent colonization of territories in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as historical and recent emigration, Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe, and a large Portuguese diaspora exists.\n\nPortuguese people began and led the Age of Exploration which started in 1415 with the conquest of Ceuta and culminated in an empire with territories that are now part of over 50 countries. The Portuguese Empire lasted nearly 600 years, seeing its end when Macau was returned to China in 1999. The discovery of several lands unknown to the Europeans in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania (southwest Pacific Ocean), helped pave the way for modern globalization and domination of Western civilization.\n\nThe Portuguese are a Southwestern European population, with origins predominantly from Southern and Western Europe. The earliest modern humans inhabiting Portugal are believed to have been Paleolithic peoples that may have arrived in the Iberian Peninsula as early as 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. Current interpretation of Y-chromosome and mtDNA data suggests that modern-day Portuguese trace a significant amount of these lineages to the paleolithic peoples who began settling the European continent between the end of the last glaciation around 45,000 years ago.\n\nNorthern Iberia is believed to have been a major Ice-age refuge from which Paleolithic humans later colonized Europe. Migrations from what is now Northern Iberia during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic, links modern Iberians to the populations of much of Western Europe and particularly the British Isles and Atlantic Europe. Recent books published by geneticists Bryan Sykes, Stephen Oppenheimer and Spencer Wells have emphasized the large Paleolithic and Mesolithic Iberian influence in the modern day Irish, Welsh and Scottish gene-pool as well as parts of the English. Indeed, Y-chromosome haplogroup R1b (of Paleolithic origin) is the most common haplogroup in practically all of the Iberian peninsula and western Europe. Within the R1b haplogroup there are modal haplotypes. One of the best-characterized of these haplotypes is the Atlantic Modal Haplotype (AMH). This haplotype reaches the highest frequencies in the Iberian Peninsula and in the British Isles. In Portugal it reckons generally 65% in the South summing 87% northwards, and in some regions 96%.\n\nThe Neolithic colonization of Europe from Western Asia and the Middle East beginning around 10,000 years ago reached Iberia, as most of the rest of the continent although, according to the demic diffusion model, its impact was most in the southern and eastern regions of the European continent.\n\nStarting in the 3rd millennium BC as well as in the Bronze Age, the first wave of migrations into Iberia of speakers of Indo-European languages occurred. These were later (7th and 5th Centuries BC) followed by others that can be identified as Celts.\nUrban cultures eventually developed in southeastern Iberia, such as Tartessos, influenced by the Phoenician colonization of coastal Mediterranean Iberia, which later shifted to Greek colonization. There is very little or no evidence of settlements in Portugal by either Greeks or Phoenicians despite some statements to the contrary.\nThese two processes defined Iberia's, and Portugal's, cultural landscape—Continental in the northwest and Mediterranean towards the southeast, as historian José Mattoso describes it.\nGiven the origins from Paleolithic and Neolithic settlers as well as Indo-European migrations, one can say that the Portuguese ethnic origin is mainly a mixture of pre-Roman, pre-Indo-Europeans (such as, in other parts of Iberia, the Iberians, Aquitanians), and pre-Celtics or para-Celts such as the Lusitanians of Lusitania, and Celtic peoples such as Calaicians or Gallaeci of Gallaecia, the Celtici and the Cynetes of the Alentejo and the Algarve.\n\nThe Romans were also an important influence on Portuguese culture; the Portuguese language derives mostly from Latin.\n\nOther minor influences included the Phoenicians/Carthaginians (small semi-permanent commercial coastal establishments in the south before 200 BC), the Vandals (Silingi and Hasdingi) and the Sarmatian Alans (both migrated to North Africa, while some were partially integrated by the Visigoths and Suebi), and the Visigoths and Suebi (including the Buri, permanently established in the early 5th century) who also settled in what is today Portuguese territory and the Maghrebis like Moors, Berbers and the Islamic Arabs who ruled the territory that is today Portugal from 711 A.D. until the reconquest of the Algarve, ending the Portuguese Reconquista in 1249. In the 9th and 10th centuries small Viking settlements were also established in the North coastal regions of Douro and Minho.\n\nFor the Y-chromosome and MtDNA lineages of the Portuguese and other peoples see this map and this one.\n\nPortuguese have also maintained a certain degree of ethnic and cultural specific characteristics-ratio with the Basques, since ancient times. The results of the present HLA study in Portuguese populations show that they have features in common with Basques and some Spaniards from Madrid: a high frequency of the HLA-haplotypes A29-B44-DR7 (ancient western Europeans) and A1-B8-DR3 are found as common characteristics. Many Portuguese, and Basques do not show the Mediterranean A33-B14-DR1 haplotype, confirming a lower admixture with Mediterraneans.\nThe Portuguese have a characteristic unique among world populations: a high frequency of HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13, which may reflect a still detectable founder effect coming from ancient Portuguese, i.e., Oestriminis and Cynetes.\n\nThe Lusitanians (or Lusitānus/Lusitani in Latin) were an Indo-European speaking people (likely Celtic) living in the Western Iberian Peninsula long before it became the Roman province of Lusitania (modern Portugal, Extremadura and a small part of Salamanca). They spoke the Lusitanian language, of which only a few short written fragments survive. Most Portuguese consider the Lusitanians as their ancestors. Although the northern regions (Minho, Douro, Tras-os-Montes) identify more with the Gallaecians.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that the Lusitanians may have originated in the Alps and settled in the region in the 6th century BC. Some modern scholars consider them to be indigenous and initially dominated by the Celts, before gaining full independence from them. The archaeologist Scarlat Lambrino proposed that they were originally a tribal Celtic group, related to the Lusones.\n\nThe first area settled by the Lusitanians was probably the Douro valley and the region of Beira Alta; then they moved south, and expanded on both sides of the Tagus river, before being conquered by the Romans.\n\nThe original Roman province of Lusitania was extended north of the areas occupied by the Lusitanians to include the territories of Asturias and Gallaecia but these were soon ceded to the jurisdiction of the \"Provincia Tarraconensis\" in the north, while the south remained the \"Provincia Lusitania et Vettones\". After this, Lusitania's northern border was along the Douro river, while its eastern border passed through \"Salmantica\" and \"Caesarobriga\" to the \"Anas\" (Guadiana) river.\n\nThe Lusitanians were a single large tribe that lived between the rivers Douro and Tagus. As the Lusitanians fought fiercely against the Romans for independence, the name Lusitania was adopted by the Gallaeci, tribes living north of the Douro, and other closely surrounding tribes, eventually spreading as a label to all the nearby peoples fighting Roman rule in the west of Iberia. It was for this reason that the Romans came to name their original province in the area, that initially covered the entire western side of the Iberian peninsula, Lusitania.\n\nTribes, often known by their Latin names, living in the area of modern Portugal, prior to Roman rule:\n\nSince 193 B.C., the Lusitanians had been fighting Rome and its expansion into the peninsula following the defeat and occupation of Carthage in North Africa. They defended themselves bravely for years, causing the Roman invaders serious defeats. In 150 B.C., they were defeated by Praetor Servius Galba: springing a clever trap, he killed 9,000 Lusitanians and later sold 20,000 more as slaves further northeast in the newly conquered Roman provinces in Gaul (modern France) by Julius Caesar. Three years later (147 B.C.), Viriathus became the leader of the Lusitanians and severely damaged the Roman rule in Lusitania and beyond. In 139 B.C. Viriathus was betrayed and killed in his sleep by his companions (who had been sent as emissaries to the Romans), Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus, bribed by Marcus Popillius Laenas. However, when Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus returned to receive their reward by the Romans, the Consul Servilius Caepio ordered their execution, declaring, \"Rome does not pay traitors\".\n\nAfter Viriathus' rule, the Lusitanians became largely romanized, adopting Roman culture and the language of Latin. The Lusitanian cities, in a manner similar to those of the rest of the Roman-Iberian peninsula, eventually gained the status of \"Citizens of Rome\". The Portuguese language itself is a local later evolution of the Roman language, Latin after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries.\n\nModern Portuguese are an Iberian ethnic group and share a similar makeup to that of the fellow Southern Europeans. The Western Coast of Iberia, which composes the land of Galicia and Portugal, was a converging point of migratory movements in the past and during the Portuguese Discoveries. As a result, the Portuguese were introduced to new cultures and ethnicities. With the end of the Indigenous Statute in the early 1960s, indigenous people of Portuguese colonies were granted Portuguese citizenship as the end of Portuguese colonialism was marked with the hand over of Macau to the People's Republic of China in 1999, after 500 years of Portuguese administration. Regarding this, it is comprehensible that any relationship between citizenship and anthropometrical features can be questioned, nevertheless, it is possible to draw the general anthropometrical features of the majority of the Portuguese population. Dark to medium brown hair and brown and hazel eyes are predominant. However, light brown and blond hair and blue and green eyes are also found frequently. Chestnut and auburn-colored hair types occur generally. Legitimate black hair—not espresso brown—can be found, but it is not very common. Light, true red hair (meaning red shades that are non-auburn) is seen on occasion.\n\nPigmentation field studies by Tamagnini (1916, 1936), Correa (1919) and others recorded national average fair hair (\"blondism\") frequencies of between 15 and 21%. True red hair (ginger) amounts to approximately 3%. However, there are higher percentages of individuals with auburn and dark red-brown shades. Dark and light sandy hair is common. Light eyes run between 19% and 30% according to recently published pigmentation maps of Europe (see P. Frost, 2006). A recent study by Candille et al. (2012) comparing pigmentation levels between the Portuguese and three other ethnically indigenous European national groups—the Irish, the Polish and the Italians—concluded that, in parts of the body not exposed to the sun, the Irish were in the lightest end of the spectrum, followed by the Portuguese, Poles and Italians, with the latter being darkest. In terms of hair color, the Portuguese averaged lighter hair than Italians and darker than Irish and Poles. The Portuguese exhibited significantly lower frequencies in lighter eye shades in comparison to the Irish and Polish, and marginally less, compared to Italians.\n\nThere are around 10 million native Portuguese in Portugal, out of a total population of 10.34 million (estimate).\n\nA small minority of about 15,000 speak the Mirandese language, (part of the Asturian-Leonese linguistic group which includes the Asturian and Leonese minority languages of Northwestern Spain ) in the municipalities of Miranda do Douro, Vimioso and Mogadouro. All of the speakers are bilingual with Portuguese.\n\nAn even smaller minority of no more than 2,000 people speak Barranquenho, a dialect of Portuguese heavily influenced by Extremaduran, spoken in the Portuguese town of Barrancos (in the border between Extremadura and Andalusia, in Spain, and Portugal).\n\nSome people from the former colonies, namely Brazil, Portuguese Africa, Macau (China), Portuguese India and East Timor, have been migrating to Portugal since the 1900s.\n\nMore recently, a great number of Slavs, especially Ukrainians (now the third biggest ethnic minority) and Russians, as well as Moldovans and Romanians, keep migrating to Portugal. There is also a Chinese minority, which are mainly of Macau Cantonese origin.\n\nIn addition, there is a small minority of Gypsies (\"Ciganos\") about 40,000 in number, Muslims about 34,000 in number and an even smaller minority of Jews of about 5,000 people (the majority are Sephardi such as the Belmonte Jews, while some are Ashkenazi).\n\nIn the whole world there are easily more than one hundred million people with recognizable Portuguese ancestors, due to the colonial expansion and worldwide immigration of Portuguese from the 16th century onwards to India, the Americas, Macau (see Macanese people), East-Timor, Malaysia, Indonesia and Africa. Between 1886 and 1966, Portugal lost to emigration more than any West European country except Ireland. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two million Portuguese left Europe to live mainly in Brazil and with significant numbers to the United States. About 40 million Brazilians have relatively recent Portuguese background, due to massive immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. About 1.2 million Brazilian citizens are native Portuguese. Significant verified Portuguese minorities exist in several countries (see table). In 1989 some 4,000,000 Portuguese were living abroad, mainly in France, Germany, Brazil, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Venezuela, and the United States.\n\nPortuguese Sephardi Jews (mostly descendants) are also in Israel, the Netherlands, the United States, France, Venezuela, Brazil and Turkey. In Brazil many of the colonists were also originally Sephardi Jews, who, converted, were known as New Christians.\n\nIn the United States, there are Portuguese communities in New Jersey, the New England states, and California. Springfield, Illinois once possessed the largest Portuguese Community in the Midwest. In the Pacific, Hawaii has a sizable Portuguese element that goes back 150 years (see Portuguese Americans), Australia and New Zealand also have Portuguese communities (see Portuguese Australians, Portuguese New Zealanders). Canada, particularly Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, has developed a significant Portuguese community since 1940 (see Portuguese Canadians). Argentina (See Portuguese Argentine and Cape Verdean Argentine) and Uruguay (see Portuguese Uruguayan) had Portuguese immigration in the early 20th century. So has Chile where an estimated 50,000 descendants live, as the country's maritime industries attracted a small number of Portuguese as well. Portuguese fishermen, farmers and laborers dispersed across the Caribbean, especially Bermuda (3.75% to 10% of the population), Guyana (4.3% of the population in 1891), Trinidad, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the island of Barbados where there is high influence from the Portuguese community.\n\nIn the early twentieth century the Portuguese government encouraged white emigration to Angola and Mozambique, and by the 1970s, there were up to 1 million Portuguese settlers living in their overseas African provinces. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975, after the Carnation Revolution, while others moved to Brazil and South Africa.\n\nAs a result, there are Portuguese influenced people with their own culture and Portuguese based dialects in parts of the world other than former Portuguese colonies, most notably in Malaysia and Singapore (see Kristang people), Indonesia, Barbados, Jamaica, Aruba, Curaçao, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana (see Portuguese immigrants in Guyana), Equatorial Guinea and Sri Lanka (see Burgher people and Portuguese Burghers).\n\nPortuguese constitute 13% of the population of Luxembourg. In 2006 there were estimates to be over half a million people of Portuguese origin in the United Kingdom (see Portuguese in the United Kingdom)—this is considerably larger than the around 88,000 Portuguese-born people alone residing in the country in 2009 (estimation; however this figure does not include British-born people of Portuguese descent). In areas such as Thetford and the crown dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey, the Portuguese form the largest ethnic minority groups at 30% of the population, 7% and 3% respectively. The British capital London is home to the largest number of Portuguese people in the UK, with the majority being found in the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Westminster. The Portuguese diaspora communities still are very attached to their language, their culture and their national dishes and particularly the bacalhau.\n\nIn colonial times, over 700,000 Portuguese settled in Brazil, and most of them went there during the gold rush of the 18th century.\nBrazil received more European settlers during its colonial era than any other country in the Americas. Between 1500 and 1760, about 700,000 Europeans immigrated to Brazil, compared to 530,000 European immigrants in the United States.\nThey managed to be the only significant European population to populate the country during colonization, even though there were French and Dutch invasions. The Portuguese migration was strongly marked by the predominance of men (colonial reports from the 16th and 17th centuries almost always report the absence or rarity of Portuguese women). This lack of women worried the Jesuits, who asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies such as Down Syndrome) if necessary. The Crown responded by sending groups of Iberian orphan maidens to marry both cohorts of marriageable men, the nobles and the peasants. Some of which were even primarily studying to be nuns. The Crown also shipped over many Órfãs d'El-Rei of what was considered \"good birth\" to colonial Brazil to marry Portuguese settlers of high rank. \"Órfãs d'El-Rei\" (modern Portuguese \"órfãs do rei\") literally translates to \"Orphans of the King\", and they were Portuguese female orphans in nubile age. There were noble and non-noble maidens and they were daughters of military compatriots who died in battle for the king or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown. Bahia's port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551. The multiplication of descendants of Portuguese settlers also happened to a large degree through miscegenation with black and amerindian women. In fact, in colonial Brazil the Portuguese men competed for the women, because among the African slaves the female component was also a small minority. This explains why the Portuguese men left more descendants in Brazil than the Amerindian or African men did. The Indian and African women were \"dominated\" by the Portuguese men, preventing men of color to find partners with whom they could have children. Added to this, White people had a much better quality of life and therefore a lower mortality rate than the black and indigenous population. Then, even though the Portuguese migration during colonial Brazil was smaller (3.2 million Indians estimated at the beginning of colonization and 3.6 million Africans brought since then, compared to the descendants of the over 700,000 Portuguese immigrants) the \"white\" population (whose ancestry was predominantly Portuguese) was as large as the \"non white\" population in the early 19th century, just before independence from Portugal.\nAfter independence from Portugal in 1822, around 1.7 million Portuguese immigrants settled in Brazil.\nPortuguese immigration into Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries was marked by its concentration in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The immigrants opted mostly for urban centers. Portuguese women appeared with some regularity among immigrants, with percentage variation in different decades and regions of the country. However, even among the more recent influx of Portuguese immigrants at the turn of the 20th century, there were 319 men to each 100 women among them. The Portuguese were different from other immigrants in Brazil, like the Germans, or Italians who brought many women along with them (even though the proportion of men was higher in any immigrant community). Despite the small female proportion, Portuguese men married mainly Portuguese women. Female immigrants rarely married Brazilian men. In this context, the Portuguese had a rate of endogamy which was higher than any other European immigrant community, and behind only the Japanese among all immigrants.\n\nEven with Portuguese heritage, many Portuguese-Brazilians identify themselves as being simply Brazilians, since Portuguese culture was a dominant cultural influence in the formation of Brazil (like many British Americans in the United States, who will never describe themselves as of British extraction, but only as \"Americans\").\n\nIn 1872, there were 3.7 million Whites in Brazil (the vast majority of them of Portuguese ancestry), 4.1 million mixed-race people (mostly of Portuguese-African-Amerindian ancestry) and 1.9 million Blacks. These numbers give the percentage of 80% of people with total or partial Portuguese ancestry in Brazil in the 1870s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a new large wave of immigrants from Portugal arrived. From 1881 to 1991, over 1.5 million Portuguese immigrated to Brazil. In 1906, for example, there were 133,393 Portuguese-born people living in Rio de Janeiro, comprising 16% of the city's population. Rio is, still today, considered the largest \"Portuguese city\" outside of Portugal itself, with 1% Portuguese-born people.\n\nGenetic studies also confirm the strong Portuguese genetic influence in Brazilians. According to a study, at least half of the Brazilian population's Y Chromosome (male inheritance) comes from Portugal. Black Brazilians have an average of 48% non-African genes, most of them may come from Portuguese ancestors. On the other hand, 33% Amerindian and 28% African contribution to the total mtDNA (female inheritance) of white Brazilians was found\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a predominant degree of European ancestry (mostly Portuguese, due to the dominant Portuguese influx among European colonization and immigration to Brazil) combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. 'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values from 51% to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.\n\nA large community-based multicenter autosomal study from 2015, considering representative samples from three different urban communities located in the Northeast (Salvador, capital of Bahia), Southeast (Bambuí, interior of Minas Gerais) and South Brazilian (Pelotas, interior of Rio Grande do Sul) regions, estimated European ancestry to be 42.4%, 83.8% and 85.3%, respectively. In all three cities, European ancestors were mainly Iberian.\n\nIt was estimated that around 25 million or more Brazilians can acquire Portuguese citizenship, due to the last Portuguese nationality law that grants citizenship to grandchildren of Portuguese nationals.\n\nAccording to an early genetic study, the Portuguese are a relatively distinct population according to HLA data, as they have a high frequency of the HLA-A25-B18-DR15 and A26-B38-DR13 genes. The later is a unique Portuguese marker - the Portuguese have neither a significant contribution to their genetic pool from paleo-North Africans (A30-B18) nor Mediterraneans (A33-B14). As such, they may have remained in relative genetic isolation compared to the rest of the Iberian populations. In Europe, the A25-B18-DR15 gene is only found in Portugal, and is also observed in white North Americans and in Brazilians (very likely of Portuguese ancestry).\n\nThe pan-European (most probably Celtic) haplotype A1-B8-DR3 and the western-European haplotype A29-B44-DR7 are shared by Portuguese, Basques and Spaniards. The later is also common in Irish, southern English, and western French populations.\n\nThe Portuguese cluster with the Basques, and these with the Spaniards and the Algerians, as data suggest that there is a common Iberian and paleo-North African origin according to some studies, showing a pre-neolithic Saharan northwards migration and admixture with ancient Iberians. The A2-B7-DR15 gene is common to those, the Cornish, Austrians and Germans, showing a much more ancient link between North Africans and western and central Europeans.\n\nR1b-5 gene cluster is a male re-expansion 15,000-13,000 years ago from Northwestern Iberia heading towards Ireland, Wales and Northern Scotland. The Rory gene cluster (R1b-14) is one of the largest re-expansions also head towards Ireland and Scotland, however featuring particularly in Irish men with Gaelic names.\n\n\n"}

Weddings are the only occasions where men dance with women. The people generally prefer painting rather than crafting. Many people are farmers, and few are artists. A notable exception is Mohammed Sadiq, a famous comedian and actor.\n\nThe music is simple, the instruments are homemade. Women play drums and men play tambour. Men and women have their own distinct drums.\n\nIn local architecture, many one-story buildings are made with bricks and cement. Each home has two doors, one for men and one for women.\n\nThe dress style is similar to the northern Sudanese people. Women wear toub that are one piece of generally a brightly colored cloth wrapped around the entire body and covering the hair. Underneath women wear dresses which are worn without the toub indoors. Men wear jalabiya, a traditional white full-length, long-sleeved gown with white trousers underneath. Wealthy Rubatab women wear jewellery to show their riches. Also, there is heavy emphasis on beauty in the eyes and women emphasize their eyes with eyeliner.\n\nThe people of the Rubatab tribe play many different games. Women play a game called \"Higla\". In this game, they draw a circle on the floor and throw rocks inside the circle and jump. Males play soccer and a game with rocks and sticks. They usually play these games after school or during break times.\n\nThe Rubatab people follow Islamic holidays. They have many traditional foods. One is called asida (porridge in English), made from sorghum, and they eat it with a tomato sauce. Another dish is called gorassa, which looks like pancake, and it is eaten with tomato sauce. They have three meals each day, breakfast is at 10 a.m., lunch is at 3 p.m. and dinner (optional) is at 10 p.m.\n\nBy tradition, when a child is born, the mother is not allowed to go out until 40 days after the birth. She stays at home with some relatives and friends. People come and give the mother money. On the seventh day after birth the child is officially named. A sheep or a cow is killed for a feast to celebrate this event. The size of the feast and the type of animal depends on the family's wealth. After 40 days have passed, there is another party, and the mother is free to leave the home.\n\nWhen someone dies, people call everyone from their family and all the family members come to the house. If the father dies, people close the room and wash the dead body. They wash the whole body with water, and afterwards they would put perfume on the body, and wrap it in white cloth. They put the body on a bed, and the body is then taken to the grave where it is buried according to Islamic procedures. When a husband dies, the wife wears white, and she stays in her home for four months and ten days. She is not supposed to put on any makeup as a sign of respect to the deceased.\n\nWomen are responsible for the house and children. Women stay at home and raise the children. Girls usually stay at home and help their mothers to cook or do other tasks. Girls are allowed to go to school and work. Although generally expected to be in the home, they can have any job they want and are also allowed to finish school. In the past, girls were not allowed to go to school. Some believe it was not safe to send girls to school, but now girls have a right to go to school.\n\nMen work to feed their family. They also must make decisions with their wives. They often sit outside separately from women during times of leisure talk or play cards. Boys have more freedom and will play outside or spend time with the men. Some families follow these general rules and others do not.\n\nMany believe that boys and men are more important than girls. They generally have a higher status, and people prefer having sons to daughters.\n\nTeenagers have to respect the elders and must follow general social rules about interaction depending on their family's perception of these traditional rules. Girls must respect boys and act like ladies by paying attention to how they dress and act. Boys are expected to act strong and emulate men. Boys must respect traditional rules about decency, which include not touching women.\n\nOld people are respected and honored by others in society. Elders teach children how to respect other people and punish those who do not follow directions.\n\nRubatab people honor those who are generous with them.\n\nIn the past, the groom would send his family. The groom would introduce himself to the girl’s family. He would tell about himself, giving details to the family. The girl’s family would go and ask others in the community about the potential groom's character and reputation. Assuming all information gathered is favorable, he brings his family to introduce them to the other family. Men greet and socialize with the men and women with the women. Women bring gifts.\n\nMost families in Rubatab give their son a house when he is ready to get married. The leader of the family is always the father. Mothers help make decision with the father, but the father is always the final decision. While some families follow traditional rules that show favoritism to boys, more recently some families treat girls more equally to boys.\n\nThe Rubatab people believe in Islam. Rubatab people trace their ancestry to Arabia. There is mutual respect for other tribes that believe in other religions. They are no other religions in the Rubatab tribe.\n\nDecisions are made by men mostly, but women do have rights if they treated fairly. Solutions are discussed and then put to a vote for a final decision. Meetings amongst decision-makers happen in safe place set aside for meetings. Meetings are often called by people in the government.\n\nThe rules in the group are respecting each other and treating people fairly. In the past, marriage outside the tribe was forbidden for both women and men.\n\nGirls and boys go to school. In some schools, girls sit separately from boys. There are girls' schools and boys' schools. The teachers are both male and female, but in high school usually women are the teachers. Subjects taught are mathematics, science and language, but the largest focus is on religion.\n\nJobs are similar to the world, such as engineering. Wealthy persons buy luxury cars and live in quality houses. Some people are self-employed. In the past people weren't allowed to trade anything to the other group, but the rules changed, and now some people do.\n\nDr. Ali Shibeika, poet, and pharmacist.\n\nZeinab Badawi, Journalist\n\n"}

After the Sui dynasty these officials mostly came from the scholar-gentry (紳士 \"shēnshì\") who had earned academic degrees (such as \"xiucai\", \"juren\", or \"jinshi\") by passing the imperial examinations. The scholar-officials were schooled in calligraphy and Confucian texts. They dominated the government and local life of China until the mid-20th century. The American philosopher and historian Charles Alexander Moore concluded: \nGenerally speaking, the record of these scholar-gentlemen has been a worthy one. It was good enough to be praised and imitated in 18th century Europe. Nevertheless, it has given China a tremendous handicap in their transition from government by men to government by law, and personal considerations in Chinese government have been a curse.\n\nSince only a select few could become court or local officials, the majority of the \"scholar-literati\" stayed in villages or cities as social leaders. The \"scholar-gentry\" carried out social welfare measures, taught in private schools, helped negotiate minor legal disputes, supervised community projects, maintained local law and order, conducted Confucian ceremonies, assisted in the governments collection of taxes, and preached Confucian moral teachings. As a class, these scholars claimed to represent morality and virtue. The district magistrate, who by regulation was not allowed to serve in his home district, depended on the local gentry for advice and for carrying out projects, which gave them the power to benefit themselves and their clients.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3272694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3272694", "title": "Scottish diaspora", "text": "Scottish diaspora\n\nThe Scottish diaspora consists of Scottish people who emigrated from Scotland and their descendants. The diaspora is concentrated in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, England, New Zealand, Ireland and to a lesser extent Argentina, Chile and Brazil.\n\nA Scottish Argentine population has existed at least since 1825. There are an estimated 100,000 Argentines of Scottish ancestry, the most of any country outside the English-speaking world. Scottish Argentines have been incorrectly referred to as English.\n\nScottish people have a long history in Canada, dating back several centuries.\nMany towns, rivers and mountains have been named in honour of Scottish explorers and traders such as Mackenzie Bay and Calgary is named after a Scottish beach. Most notably, the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia is Latin for New Scotland. Once Scots formed the vanguard of the movement of Europeans across the continent. In more modern times, emigrants from Scotland have played a leading role in the social, political and economic history of Canada, being prominent in banking, labour unions, and politics.\n\nThe first documented Scottish settlement in the Americas was of Nova Scotia (New Scotland) in 1629. On 29 September 1621, the charter for the foundation of a colony was granted by James VI of Scotland to Sir William Alexander. Between 1622 and 1628, Sir William launched four attempts to send colonists to Nova Scotia; all failed for various reasons. A successful occupation of Nova Scotia was finally achieved in 1629. The colony's charter, in law, made Nova Scotia (defined as all land between Newfoundland and New England) a part of mainland Scotland; this was later used to get around the English navigation acts. The Scots have influenced the cultural mix of Nova Scotia for centuries and constitute the largest ethnic group in the province, at 29.3% of its population. Many Scottish immigrants were monoglot Scottish Gaelic speakers from the Gàidhealtachd (Scottish Highlands). Canadian Gaelic was spoken as the first language in much of \"Anglophone\" Canada, such as Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Glengarry County in Ontario. Gaelic was the third most commonly spoken language in Canada.\n\nAs the third-largest ethnic group in Canada and amongst the first Europeans to settle in the country, Scottish people have made a large impact on Canadian culture since colonial times. According to the 2011 Census of Canada, the number of Canadians claiming full or partial Scottish descent is 4,714,970, or 15.10% of the nation's total population.\n\nA large proportion of Scottish Chileans are sheep farmers in the Magallanes region of the far south of the country, and the city of Punta Arenas has a large Scottish foundation dating back to the 18th century.\nA famous Scot, Thomas, Lord Cochrane (later 10th Earl of Dundonald) formed the Chilean Navy to help liberate Chile from Spain in the independence period. Chile developed a strong diplomatic relationship with Great Britain and invited more British settlers to the country in the 19th century.\n\nThe Chilean government land deals invited settlement from Scotland and Wales in its southern provinces in the 1840s and 1850s. The number of Scottish Chileans is still higher in Patagonia and Magallanes regions.\n\"The Mackay School\", in Viña del Mar is an example of a school set up by Scottish Chileans. The Scottish and other British Chileans are primarily found in higher education as well in economic management and the country's cultural life.\n\nIn the 2013 American Community Survey 5,310,285 identified as Scottish & 2,976,878 Scots-Irish descent. Large scale emigration from Scotland to America began in the 1700s after the Battle of Culloden where the Clan structures were broken up. Anti-Catholic persecution and the Highland Clearances also obliged many Scottish Gaels to emigrate. The Scots went in search of a better life and settled in the thirteen colonies, mainly around South Carolina and Virginia.\n\nThe number of Americans of Scottish descent today is estimated to be 20 to 25 million (up to 8.3% of the total US population), and Scotch-Irish, 27 to 30 million (up to 10% of the total US population), the subgroups overlapping and not always distinguishable because of their shared ancestral surnames.\n\nThe majority of Scotch-Irish originally came from Lowland Scotland and the Scottish Borders before migrating to the province of Ulster in Ireland (see \"Plantation of Ulster\") and thence, beginning about five generations later, to North America in large numbers during the eighteenth century.\n\nThe table shows the ethnic Scottish population in the United States from 1700 to 2013. In 1700 the total population of the American colonies was 250,888 of which 223,071 (89%) were white and 3.0% were ethnically Scottish.\nIn the 2000 census, 4.8 million Americans self-reported Scottish ancestry, 1.7% of the total US population. Another 4.3 million self-reported Scotch-Irish ancestry, for a total of 9.2 million Americans self-reporting some kind of Scottish descent. \n\nSelf-reported numbers are regarded by demographers as massive under-counts, because Scottish ancestry is known to be disproportionately under-reported among the majority of mixed ancestry, and because areas where people reported \"American\" ancestry were the places where, historically, \nScottish and Scotch-Irish Protestants settled in America (that is: along the North American coast, Appalachia, and the Southeastern United States).\n\nScottish Americans descended from nineteenth-century Scottish immigrants tend to be concentrated in the West, while others in New England are the descendants of immigrants from the Maritime Provinces of Canada, especially in the 1920s.\n\nAmericans of Scottish descent outnumber the population of Scotland, where 4,459,071 or 88.09% of people identified as ethnic Scottish in the 2001 Census. There are many clan societies and other heritage organizations, such as An Comunn Gàidhealach America and Slighe nan Gàidheal.\n\nA steady rate of Scottish immigration continued into the 20th century, with substantial numbers of Scots continued to arrive after 1945. From 1900 until the 1950s, Scots favoured New South Wales, as well as Western Australia and Southern Australia. A strong cultural Scottish presence is evident in the Highland games, dance, Tartan day celebrations, Clan and Gaelic speaking societies found throughout modern Australia.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Australian census 130,204 Australian residents were born in Scotland, while 1,792,600 claimed Scottish ancestry, either alone or in combination with another ancestry. This is the fourth most commonly nominated ancestry and represents over 8.9% of the total population of Australia.\n\nScottish migration to New Zealand dates back to the earliest period of European colonisation, with a large proportion of Pākehā New Zealanders being of Scottish descent. However, identification as \"British\" or \"European\" New Zealanders can sometimes obscure their origin. Many Scottish New Zealanders also have Māori or other non-European ancestry.\n\nThe majority of Scottish immigrants settled in the South Island. All over New Zealand, the Scots developed different means to bridge the old homeland and the new. Many Caledonian societies were formed, well over 100 by the early twentieth century, who helped maintain Scottish culture and traditions. From the 1860s, these societies organised annual Caledonian Games throughout New Zealand. The Games were sports meets that brought together Scottish settlers and the wider New Zealand public. In so doing, the Games gave Scots a path to cultural integration as Scottish New Zealanders.\n\nThe Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland founded Dunedin at the head of Otago Harbour in 1848 as the principal town of its Scottish settlement. The name comes from \"Dùn Èideann\", the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. Charles Kettle the city's surveyor, instructed to emulate the characteristics of Edinburgh, produced a striking, 'Romantic' design. The result was both grand and quirky streets as the builders struggled and sometimes failed to construct his bold vision across the challenging landscape. Captain William Cargill, a veteran of the war against Napoleon, was the secular leader. The Reverend Thomas Burns, a nephew of the poet Robert Burns, was the spiritual guide.\n\nThe Ulster Scots (Ulster-Scots: Ulstèr-Scotch), commonly known as Scots-Irish outside of Ireland, are an ethnic group in Ireland, found mostly in the Ulster region and to a lesser extent in the rest of Ireland. Their ancestors were mostly Protestant Lowland Scottish migrants, the largest numbers coming from the Border Reivers culture of the Scottish Borders, from Galloway and Ayrshire, although some came from further north in the Scottish Lowlands and also to a lesser extent from the Highlands.\n\nThese Scots migrated to Ireland in large numbers both as a result of the government-sanctioned Plantation of Ulster, a planned process of colonisation which took place under the auspices of James VI of Scotland and I of England on land confiscated from members of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland who fled Ulster and as part of a larger migration or unplanned wave of settlement.\n\nUlster Scots emigrated onwards from Ireland in significant numbers to what is now the United States and to all corners of the then-worldwide British Empire—what are now Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, to British India, and to a lesser extent to Argentina and Chile. Scotch-Irish (or Scots-Irish) is a traditional term for Ulster Scots who emigrated to North America.\n\nFrom as far back as the mid-16th century there were Scots trading and settling in Poland. A \"Scotch Pedlar's Pack in Poland\" became a proverbial expression. It usually consisted of cloths, woollen goods and linen kerchiefs (head coverings). Itinerants also sold tin utensils and ironware such as scissors and knives. Along with the protection offered by King Stephen in the Royal Grant of 1576, a district in Kraków was assigned to Scottish immigrants.\n\nRecords from 1592 mention Scots settlers granted citizenship of Kraków, and give their employment as trader or merchant. Fees for citizenship ranged from 12 Polish florins to a musket and gunpowder, or an undertaking to marry within a year and a day of acquiring a holding.\n\nBy the 17th century, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Scots lived in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Many came from Dundee and Aberdeen. Scots could be found in Polish towns on the banks of the Vistula as far south as Kraków. Settlers from Aberdeenshire were mainly Episcopalians or Catholics, but there were also large numbers of Calvinists. As well as Scottish traders, there were also many Scottish soldiers in Poland. In 1656, a number of Scottish highlanders who were disenchanted with Oliver Cromwell's rule went to Poland to join the service of the King of Sweden in his war against it.\n\nThe Scots integrated well and many acquired great wealth. They contributed to many charitable institutions in the host country, but did not forget their homeland; for example, in 1701 when collections were made for the restoration fund of the Marischal College, Aberdeen, Scottish settlers in Poland gave generously.\n\nMany royal grants and privileges were granted to Scottish merchants until the 18th century, at which time the settlers began to merge more and more into the native population. \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\" was half Polish, since he was the son of James Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\", and Clementina Sobieska, granddaughter of Jan Sobieski, King of Poland. In 1691, the City of Warsaw elected the Scottish immigrant Aleksander Czamer (Alexander Chalmers) as its mayor.\n\n"}

Believing her to be a divine presence, he and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her \"Princess\". The girl grows rapidly and conspicuously, causing her parents to marvel and earning her the nickname \"Takenoko\" (Little Bamboo) from the other village children. Sutemaru, the oldest among Kaguya's friends, develops a close relationship with her.\n\nMiyatsuko comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove in the same way he found his daughter. He takes these as proof of her divine royalty and begins planning to make her a proper princess. He relocates the family to the capital, forcing her to leave her friends behind. She finds herself in a mansion, replete with servants. She is also saddled with a governess who is tasked with taming her into a noblewoman. She struggles with the restraints of nobility, arguing that life should be full of laughter and struggle.\n\nWhen the girl comes of age, she is granted the formal name of \"Princess Kaguya\" for the light and life that radiates from her. Miyatsuko holds a celebration in commemoration of her naming. At the celebration, Kaguya overhears partygoers ridiculing her father's attempts to turn a peasant girl into a noble through money. Kaguya flees the capital in despair and runs back to the mountains, seeking Sutemaru and her other friends, but discovers that they have all moved away. Kaguya passes out in the snow and awakens back at the party.\n\nKaguya grows in beauty, attracting scores of suitors. Five men of noble standing court her, comparing her to mythical treasures. Kaguya tells them she will only marry whoever can bring her the mythical treasure mentioned. Two suitors attempt to persuade her with counterfeits. The third abandons his conquest out of cowardice, and the fourth attempts to woo her with flattering lies. When one of the men is killed in his quest, Kaguya falls into depression. Eventually, the Emperor takes notice of her. Taken with her beauty, he makes advances toward her, revolting her. Kaguya then demonstrates the ability to disappear at will, surprising the Emperor. Understanding that he has been too forward, the Emperor takes his leave.\n\nKaguya reveals to her parents that she originally came from the Moon after it spoke to her. Once a resident of the Moon, she broke its laws, hoping to be exiled to Earth so that she could experience mortal life. When the Emperor made his advances, she silently begged the Moon to help her. Having heard her prayer, the Moon will reclaim her during the next full moon. Kaguya confesses her attachment to Earth and her reluctance to leave.\n\nMiyatsuko swears to protect Kaguya and begins assembling defensive forces. Kaguya returns to her hometown in the mountains once more. She finds Sutemaru and tells him she would have been happiest with him; Sutemaru vows to protect her. The two run around the grass field and Kaguya demonstrates the ability to fly. However, she loses it when they fly by the Moon, and the two drop into the water. Sutemaru wakes up on the grass field, thinking it was a dream, while Kaguya is seen in a carriage going back to the palace.\n\nOn the night of the full moon, a procession of celestial beings led by the Buddha descends from the Moon, and Miyatsuko is unable to stop it. An attendant offers Kaguya a robe that will erase her memories of Earth. Kaguya begs the attendant to grant her a last moment with her parents.\n\nThe attendant assures her that upon returning to the Moon, she will be free of Earth's impurities. Kaguya rebuffs her, saying that Earth is full of wonder and life. The attendant then drapes the robe around Kaguya, and she appears to forget about her life on Earth. The procession ascends to the Moon, leaving Miyatsuko and his wife distraught. Kaguya looks back one last time, and tears run down her eyes as she recognizes the love from her parents.\n\nStudio Ghibli revealed that Isao Takahata was working on a feature-length film in 2008. Takahata announced at the 62nd Locarno International Film Festival in 2009 that he intended to direct a film based on the Japanese folktale \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\". The release of \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\" was finally confirmed by Studio Ghibli and distributor Toho on 13 December 2012.\n\nIn 2012, Shinichiro Ikebe was announced to write the film's score. However, in 2013, Joe Hisaishi replaced Ikebe as the composer. This is the first and only time that Hisaishi has scored a film directed by Isao Takahata. The theme song \"When I Remember This Life\" was performed by Kazumi Nikaidō. The film's soundtrack was released on 20 November 2013.\n\n\"The Tale of The Princess Kaguya\" was initially announced to be released simultaneously with \"The Wind Rises\", another Ghibli film by Hayao Miyazaki in Japan in the summer of 2013, which would have marked the first time that the works of the two directors were released together since the release of the films \"My Neighbor Totoro\" and \"Grave of the Fireflies\" in 1988. However, in February 2013, distributor Toho announced that the release of \"Kaguya-Hime no Monogatari\" would be delayed to Fall 2013, citing concerns that the storyboards were not yet complete. On 12 March 2014, independent distributor GKIDS announced that it had acquired the US rights for the film and that it would release an English dub version produced by Studio Ghibli and Frank Marshall. Chloë Grace Moretz is the voice of the title character in the English dub. It was released in select theatres in North America on 17 October 2014 and was also released on DVD and Blu-ray in Japan on 3 December 2014. The film was selected to be screened as part of the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Its North American premiere took place at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival as part of the festival's \"Masters\" program.\n\nThe film debuted at first place during its opening weekend in Japan, grossing ¥284 million (US$2.8 million). By 2 February 2014, the film had grossed ¥2,313,602,733 (US$22,613,153) at the Japanese box office. Total gross of the film worldwide is $24,186,232.\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film a score of 100% \"Certified Fresh\" with an average rating of 8.3/10 based on 86 reviews. The critics' consensus says, \"Boasting narrative depth, frank honesty, and exquisite visual beauty, \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\" is a modern animated treasure with timeless appeal.\"\n\nIn February 2014, \"The Tale of the Princess Kaguya\" placed 4th in both Kinema Junpo's Best Ten and their Reader's Choice Awards. David Ehrlich of \"The A.V.

{"id": "35330752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35330752", "title": "Third-party punishment", "text": "Third-party punishment\n\nThird-party punishment, or altruistic punishment, is punishment of a transgressor (first party) which is administered, not by a victim of the transgression (second party), but rather by a third party not directly affected by the transgression. It has been argued that third-party punishments are the essence of social norms, as they are evolutionary stable unlike second-party punishments. It has also been shown that third-party punishments are exhibited in all examined populations, though the magnitude of the punishments varies greatly, and that costly punishment co-varies with altruistic behavior. Differences between within-group and inter-group altruistic punishments have also been observed.\n\nSome of the common experiments in experimental economics concerning the study of second-party punishments with respect to distribution and cooperation norms have been dictator games and prisoner's dilemma games. These games can also be effectively used in the study of third-party punishments with respect to distribution and cooperation norms with some modifications.\n\nConcerning third-party dictator game (TP-DG), the game was modified to include a third person with a punishment option between the dictator and the recipient. The dictator was given an endowment of 100, of which he could choose to share any portion with the recipient. The third person observer was also given an endowment of 50, of which he could choose to spend in order to punish the dictator. If self-interest was the driving force for the decision making, then the dictator would choose to donate none of his endowment, and the third party observer would choose to spend none of his endowment punishing the dictator. However, roughly 60% of the third party observers chose to punish dictators who donated less than half their endowment.\n\nIn a variation of the TP-DG, the third party observer could choose to spend part of the endowment to punish the dictator or could spend part of the endowment to compensate the recipient. About 40% of the third party observers chose to do both, while 32% chose to compensate the recipient and only about 6% opted to punish only. This indicates that compensation is preferred over punishment in the TP-DG when an offer is perceived as unfair. This suggests that third-party punishment may be motivated by a desire to both provide justice for those who have been wronged and to reprimand those who violate expected social norms.\n\nConcerning third-party prisoner's dilemma (TP-PD), the game was modified so that in addition to two players who would choose to either cooperate or defect, a third party observer could choose to punish the players. The payoffs of the game were such that the players would be best off if they defected; however, if both players chose to defect, their payoff would be less than if they had cooperated. The observer could then choose to spend from his endowment to punish the defectors who chose to put self-interest ahead of cooperation. From previous theories, it can be concluded that subjects are willing to cooperate if the probability that others will also do so is sufficiently large. Once again, if self-interest was the decision maker for these players, neither would choose to cooperate, and the observer would also choose to keep his full endowment and not issue any punishments. However, about 45.8% of observers chose to punish the defector when he is paired with a cooperator, and 20.8% chose to punish both players if they had both defected. It's important to note that the magnitude of punishment was much larger when one defected.\n\nWith respect to the distribution norms violations (dictator games), it has been shown that second-party punishments are consistently higher than third-party punishments for dictators that choose to share less than half of their endowment. The punishments were such that the dictators could still profit from giving less than half in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. The levels of punishment were consistently low for both second and third-party punishments if the levels of endowment were higher than half.\n\nWith respect to the cooperation norms violations (prisoner's dilemma), it has been shown that second-party punishments are consistently higher than third-party punishments for defectors. The punishments were such that the defectors could still profit in the third-party conditions, but could not profit in the second-party conditions. Punishment for cooperators were negligible under both conditions.\n\nCurrent evolutionary models state that human altruism evolved through the selective (cultural or biological) extinction of groups in inter-group conflicts. However, there is also evidence for altruism and norms between groups. Some models suggest that third party punishment of \"free-riders\" (those who do not cooperate) leads to increased group cooperation due to individual selection for cooperative traits.\n\nWhen subjects were examined with a PET scan while playing a second-party trust game with another player, it was shown that when they administered punishment, the dorsal striatum, an area of the brain associated with the processing of rewards as a result of goal-directed actions, was activated. It was also shown that individuals with stronger activations of the dorsal striatum were willing to incur greater cost in order to punish the norm violator. This suggests that the people that administrated punishment against norm violators derived satisfaction from the act.\n\nFMRI has also been used to examine third-party punishment. Subjects participated in a TP-DG during the scan as either a second party recipient or a third party observer. The nucleus accumbens, a brain region associated with reward, had punishment-related activation for both the second-party and third-party punishment conditions. The overall pattern of activation was consistent between the two conditions, though activation was stronger in the second party recipients. This suggests that second-party and third-party punishment decisions have a common neural basis.\n\nIt has been shown that altruistic punishment exists across many examined populations, but that there is also a large variance between them. Data gathered from 15 different populations showed that when participating in TP-DG, all societies showed a decreasing frequency of punishment as the dictator's offer approached 50%. There was, however, a large variance between societies as to how much of their endowment the observers were willing to pay in order to punish the dictator. These variances were not attributed to economic and demographic variables. It was also found that societies with high degrees of punishment also exhibit more altruistic behavior. Other studies have suggested that people in larger, more complex societies engage in significantly more third-party punishment than people in small-scale societies.\n\nWomen have been found to contribute more in dictator games and also to be more likely to accept an offer than men, rather than to reject an offer to punish the dictator. This was found for second-party punishment experiments but has not been observed in studies examining third-party punishment. In mock trial experiments studying third-party punishment using legal scenarios, woman majority mock juries are more likely to convict than non-woman majority juries and are more likely to find a defendant guilty in a rape case. Men are more likely to be influenced by the attractiveness of the defendant than women.\n\nThere are significant differences in third-party punishment behavior between age groups. In a variation of the TP-DG, 8-year-olds based their punishment on the outcome of the unfair result and did not consider the intention of the actor in both second-party and third-party punishment decisions. Adolescents integrated the outcome and the intention when making second- but not third-party punishment decisions. Adults integrated the outcome and the intention of the act for both second- and third-party punishment. This demonstrates developmental differences in how third-party punishment decisions are made.\n\nParochial altruism refers to altruism that is directed in a preferential manner towards members of one's own social group. In order to examine this effect, a study examined the outcomes of TP-DG experiments carried out in between two Papua New Guinea indigenous groups. The games had 4 conditions, which included: players A (dictator), B (recipient), and C (observer) all from the same group; only A and B from the same group; only A and C from the same group; only B and C from the same group. Current behavioral theories state that norms are emergent from interactions within groups, and therefore, outsiders don’t obey the norm nor benefit from the altruistic behavior the norm enforces. This theory would therefore predict that no punishment will occur in any of the cases except for the ABC treatment condition. However, it was found that punishment was qualitatively similar in all 4 conditions, which suggests that egalitarian sharing norms exist within-groups and also between-groups.\n\nIt was observed that, while all 4 conditions exhibited egalitarian sharing norms, punishments were much higher in the ABC and BC conditions. This suggests that victims are more protected if the third-party observer belongs to same group as them. It was also found that the dictators expected much harsher punishments if third-party observers belonged to the same group as the victim. It was also found that transfers were higher in groups with the same A and B members, and lower in groups with the same A and C members, suggesting that the dictators expected leniency from third-party observers of their own group.\n\n\n"}

A good that is not tradable is called non-tradable. Different goods have differing levels of tradability: the higher the cost of transportation and the shorter the shelf life, the less tradable a good is. Prepared food, for example, is not generally considered a tradable good; it will be sold in the city in which it is produced and does not directly compete with other cities' prepared foods. Haircuts and massages are also non-tradable.\n\nPerfectly tradable goods, like shares of stock, are subject to the law of one price: they should cost the same amount wherever they are bought. This law requires an efficient market. Any discrepancy that may exist in pricing perfectly tradable goods because of foreign exchange market movements, for instance, is called an arbitrage opportunity. Goods that cannot be costlessly traded are not subject to this law.\n\nLess than perfectly tradable goods subject to distortions such as the Penn effect, for example, a lowering of prices in less wealthy place. Perfectly non-tradable goods are not subject to any leveling of price, thus the disparity between similar parcels of real estate in different locations.\n\nThere should be no distortions in purchasing power parity for perfectly tradable goods. The differences between it and other methods are the result of non-tradable goods and the above-mentioned Penn effect.\n"}

{"id": "31689888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31689888", "title": "Women in Laos", "text": "Women in Laos\n\nLaotian women have long been active participants in their nation's society, involved in politics, driving social transformation and development, becoming active in the world of business and serving as nurses and food producers for the military. Due to modernization and rural uprooting, Lao women have begun to embrace lifestyles that are foreign to traditional Laotian ideals.\n\nUnder the Constitution of Laos, Lao women are legally equal to Lao men. They have the right to vote and to inherit property. In practice, the roles and status of women in Lao society often depend on ethnic affiliation. In some cases, as in the status of Lao Loum women, the youngest daughter is often assigned the task of caring for elderly parents in return for inheritance benefits like land and business.\n\nAfter receiving her inheritance, the daughter does not obtain direct control over the land or business, as her husband possesses executive power over such matters. Other women from different ethnic groups do not inherit anything. In 1993, the government of Lao established a program of land surveying and titling which was nominally more beneficial to female landholders. National legislation declaring Lao men and women as \"equally entitled to hold property\" was also promulgated, including the Family Law proclaiming that \"any property purchased during marriage is regarded as joint property\", and that the \"land owned by a woman prior to her marriage remains her individual property, as does any land she inherits from her parents”.\n\nMany rural Lao women undertake a variety of semi-formal roles in their communities, including handicrafts, commerce, public health, and education, in addition to their traditional roles as homemakers and the caretakers of children. In the cities and at the government level, Lao women are underrepresented, particularly in high-level positions. In terms of wages, women typically receive lower salaries than men.\n\nIn connection with Lao Buddhism and traditional beliefs, many Lao women are taught that they can only attain nirvana after they have been reborn as men.\n\nFewer Laotian girls enroll in schools than boys. After World War II, many women, such as the silk weavers of the Bai Hai population, became increasingly engaged in unskilled manual labour. Despite being less literate and educated than men on average (63% of Lao females can read and write, compared to 83% of males), Lao women increasingly became the primary wage earners of their family units, especially in rural areas.\n\nIn recent decades, Lao women have furthermore benefited from microfinancing programs offered by organizations such as the Social Economic Developers Association (SEDA). In such programs, women receive training in establishing businesses, business management, procurement of materials, mass production, price negotiation for products, financial management, marketing strategies, writing skills, business planning, and decision-making. This is intended to assist women in becoming empowered and obtaining \"financial stability\".\n\nAnother organization involved in women's education is the Lao Disabled Women's Development Centre, an institution that trains handicapped Lao women. The Lao Disabled Women's Development Centre was established by Chanhpheng Sivila, and functioned primarily as a series of workshops before expanding in 2002. Another similar group focusing on the rights, empowerment, and health of Lao women is the Committee for Women's Advancement of the province of Sayaboury.\n\nThe women of Lao obtained the right to vote and to be elected in 1958. They remain underrepresented in government at both local and national levels.\n\nIn recent decades women have made notable inroads into politics. In 1997, Onechanh Thammavong became one of the vice-presidents of the National Assembly of Laos. In March 2011, the National Assembly provided a seminar for forty-seven female candidates in advance of the 7th Lao general elections in April 2011, in order to instil the “significant duties of the national legislature body” in the women.\n\nIn Lao society, women who divorce their husbands are traditionally stigmatised, often finding it difficult to find another spouse.\n\nAs with many of the poorer states of South-East Asia, human trafficking and prostitution are serious issues for Lao women.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11494262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11494262", "title": "Yalunka people", "text": "Yalunka people\n\nThe Yalunka, also spelled Jallonke, Yalonga, Djallonké, Djallonka or Dialonké, are a Mande people who have lived in the Futa Jallon (), a mountainous region in Guinea, West Africa since about the 11th century. The name Yalunka literally means \"inhabitants of the Jallon (mountains).\"\n\nThey are a branch of the Mandé peoples of West Africa, and closely related to the Susu people. Some scholars classify the two as one group. The Yalunka are notable for having first converted to Islam, but then renouncing Islam en masse when Muslim Fula people began dominating their region. The Yalunka fought against the Fula jihads, left Futa Jallon, migrated and established new towns such as Falaba near the region where Rokel River starts, while others settled among the Koranko, Limba and Kissi people. Ultimately, the Yalunka were subdued and absorbed by the Fulani Empire.\n\nThey speak the Yalunka language which belongs to the Mande branch of the Niger–Congo language family. Yalunka is mutually intelligible with Susu, another Mande language. In the contemporary era, the Yalunka are concentrated mostly in Guinea and Sierra Leone.\n\nThe ancient history of Yalunka people is unknown. The earliest evidence suggests that sometime around the eleventh century, the Yalunka people arrived in the hilly plateau region of the Futa Jallon in Guinea. They converted to Islam. After the seventeenth century, Islamic theocracies supported by the Fula people began a period of Fula dominance and their version of Islam in the region traditionally occupied by the Yalunka. The Yalunka people, along with the Susu people, then renounced Islam. The Fula people and their leaders such as Ibrahima Musa and Ibrahima Sori launched a series of jihads targeted against the Yalunka in the eighteenth century. The Yalunka were defeated, subdued and returned to Islam in 1778.\n\nThe Yalunka are predominantly Muslim (99%). At the same time, they have retained many pre-Islamic beliefs and practices, combining the two in a syncretic way. One of their traditional practice is \"Barinkiina\", which involves making sacrifices in memory of their ancestors to gain power. They also make sacrifices for \"Suxurena\" and \"Nyinanna\", or nature spirits, in order to gain powers. However, they are devoted Muslims and their fear of persecution have prevented them from converting to other religions.\n\nThe New Testament was translated into the Yalunka language by Pioneer Bible Translators's current president, Greg Pruett in 2013.\n\nThe Yalunka live in larger settlements established since the 18th century. The Yalunka region is mixed savannah and forest. The country is hilly, and most of it is 1,000 to 2,000 feet above sea level. Most Yalunka settlements are located in the valleys between the hills. Since the 1950s, many Yalunka have migrated to cities to find work.\n\nThe Yalunka people commonly practice polygyny (having multiple wives). Arranged marriages are their traditional practice, and they follow the Islamic law that a man may have up to four living wives. The first wife has seniority and authority over wives he marries later. The husband, according to Bankole Taylor, \"has complete control over his wives and is responsible for feeding and clothing them\".\n\nThe Yalunka society is patriarchal, consisting of households headed by a man, his wife or wives, and their unmarried children. Extended households form a compound, which may consist of two or more married men from the same father and their families, each living in a separate hut.\n\nThe Yalunka are primarily subsistence farmers, with rice and millet being their staple crops. Peanuts, sweet potatoes, maize, and beans are also grown. Chickens, herds of cattle, and flocks of sheep and goats are kept. Goats and cattle provide milk as a food source, which is used directly and processed for cheese and other products. This livestock, such as goats and cattle, are very important as a marker of wealth and because they serve as bride-price payments. The boy's family gives animals to the girl's family before the marriage takes place. These animals are also used as a means of economic exchange.\n\nAmong the Yalunka, herding is done by the children. The women milk the cattle, churn the butter, and help the men in some of the agricultural work. Honey is another important commodity among the Yalunka. The people suspend large, water-tight baskets in trees. The bees use the baskets as hives and make honey in them. Every year, between four and six gallons of honey may be gathered from each basket.\n\n\n"}
