Past events include the end of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger events, Heinrich events and possibly also the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. The term is also used within the context of global warming to describe sudden climate change that is detectable over the time-scale of a human lifetime. One proposed cause of such events is feedback loops within the climate system both enhance small perturbations and cause a variety of stable states.\n\nTimescales of events described as 'abrupt' may vary dramatically. Changes recorded in the climate of Greenland at the end of the Younger Dryas, as measured by ice-cores, imply a sudden warming of + within a timescale of a few years. Other abrupt changes are the + on Greenland 11,270 years ago or the abrupt + warming 22,000 years ago on Antarctica. By contrast, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum may have initiated anywhere between a few decades and several thousand years. Finally, Earth Systems models project that under ongoing greenhouse gas emissions as early as 2047, the Earth's near surface temperature could depart from the range of variability in the last 150 years, affecting over 3 billion people and most places of great species diversity on Earth.\n\nAccording to the Committee on Abrupt Climate Change of the National Research Council:\n\nThere are essentially two definitions of abrupt climate change:\n\n\nThese definitions are complementary: the former gives some insight into how abrupt climate change comes about ; the latter explains why there is so much research devoted to it.\n\nPossible tipping elements in the climate system include: regional effects of global warming, some of which had abrupt onset and may therefore be regarded as abrupt climate change. Scientists have stated that \"Our synthesis of present knowledge suggests that a variety of tipping elements could reach their critical point within this century under anthropogenic climate change.\"\n\nIt has been postulated that teleconnections, oceanic and atmospheric processes, on different timescales, connect both hemispheres during abrupt climate change.\n\nThe IPCC states that global warming \"could lead to some effects that are abrupt or irreversible\".\n\nIn an article in \"Science\", Richard Alley et al. said \"it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large, abrupt events. Were such an event to recur, the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious.\"\n\nA 2013 report from the U.S. National Research Council called for attention to the abrupt impacts of climate change, stating that even steady, gradual change in the physical climate system can have abrupt impacts elsewhere—in human infrastructure and ecosystems for example—if critical thresholds are crossed. The report emphasizes the need for an early warning system that could help society better anticipate sudden changes and emerging impacts.\n\nScientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor. The probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be low. Factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming, warming that occurs more rapidly, and warming that is sustained over longer time periods.\n\nClimate models are unable yet to predict abrupt climate change events, or most of the past abrupt climate shifts. A potential abrupt feedback due to thermokarst lake formations in the Arctic, in response to thawing permafrost soils, releasing additional greenhouse gas methane, is currently not accounted for in climate models.\n\nMost abrupt climate shifts, are likely due to sudden circulation shifts, analogous to a flood cutting a new river channel. The best-known examples are the several dozen shutdowns of the North Atlantic Ocean's Meridional Overturning Circulation during the last ice age, affecting climate worldwide.\n\n\nGlobal oceans have established patterns of currents. Several potential disruptions to this system of currents have been identified as a result of global warming:\n\nHansen et al. 2015 found, that the shutdown or substantial slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), besides possibly contributing to extreme end-Eemian events, will cause a more general increase of severe weather. Additional surface cooling from ice melt increases surface and lower tropospheric temperature gradients, and causes in model simulations a large increase of mid-latitude eddy energy throughout the midlatitude troposphere. This in turn leads to an increase of baroclinicity produced by stronger temperature gradients, which provides energy for more severe weather events.\n\nAbrupt climate change has likely been the cause of wide ranging and severe effects:\n\nOne source of abrupt climate change effects is a feedback process, in which a warming event causes a change which leads to further warming. This can also apply to cooling. Example of such feedback processes are:\n\n\nIsostatic rebound in response to glacier retreat (unloading), increased local salinity, have been attributed to increased volcanic activity at the onset of the abrupt Bølling-Allerød warming, are associated with the interval of intense volcanic activity, hinting at a interaction between climate and volcanism - enhanced short-term melting of glaciers, possibly via albedo changes from particle fallout on glacier surfaces.\n\nSeveral periods of abrupt climate change have been identified in the paleoclimatic record. Notable examples include:\n\n\nThere are also abrupt climate changes associated with the catastrophic draining of glacial lakes. One example of this is the 8.2 kiloyear event, which associated with the draining of Glacial Lake Agassiz. Another example is the Antarctic Cold Reversal, c. 14,500 years before present (BP), which is believed to have been caused by a meltwater pulse from the Antarctic ice sheet. These rapid meltwater release events have been hypothesized as a cause for Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles,\n\nA 2017 study concluded that similar conditions to today's Antarctic ozone hole (atmospheric circulation and hydroclimate changes), ∼17,700 years ago, when stratospheric ozone depletion contributed to abrupt accelerated Southern Hemisphere deglaciation. The event coincidentally happened with an estimated 192-year series of massive volcanic eruptions, attributed to Mount Takahe in West Antarctica.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "899882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=899882", "title": "Afridi", "text": "Afridi\n\nThe Afrīdī ( \"Aprīdai\", plur. \"Aprīdī\"; ) is a Pashtun tribe present in Pakistan, with substantial numbers in Afghanistan. The Afridis are most dominant in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, inhabiting about 100p mi² (3000 km²) of rough hilly area in the eastern Spin Ghar range west of Peshawar, covering most of Khyber Agency, FR Peshawar and FR Kohat. Their territory includes the Khyber Pass and Maidan in Tirah. Afridi migrants are also found in India, mostly in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe Afridis are historically known for the strategic location they inhabit and their belligerence against outside forces; battling the Mughal dynasty's armies throughout Mughal rule. The later clashes against British expeditions comprised the most savage fighting of the Anglo-Afghan Wars.\n\nAfter the creation of Pakistan, Afridi tribesmen also helped attack Jammu and Kashmir for Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1947. Today, Afridis make use of their dominant social position in FATA and areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by controlling transport and various businesses, including trade in arms, munitions, and other goods.\n\nThe Afridi are Pashtuns, part of the Karlani tribal confederacy, who fought both against and with the British in Afghanistan during all three Anglo-Afghan wars. The British frequently classified the peoples that they conquered with fixed personality or “racial” traits and regarded the Pashtun Afridi tribesmen as “warlike” peoples and one of the Martial Race. Different Afridi clans cooperated with the British forces in exchange for subsidies, and some even served with the Khyber Rifles, an auxiliary force of the British Indian Army.\n\nAfridis speak the Afridi Pashto.\n\nThe Afridis, classically called the Abaörteans (; ), have their original homeland as Tirah, in Khyber Agency.\n\nAccording to Pashtun folklore, the Afridi tribe traces its origin back to the eponymous ancestor of all Pashtuns, Qais Abdur Rashid, through his youngest son, Karlan. Thus, the Afridi tribe are one of the Karlani tribe.\n\nHerodotus mentions a tribe of the Pactyans as Aparytai (Ἀπαρύται). Scholars Grierson, Stein and Olaf Caroe equate these with modern Afridis on the basis of linguistic and geographic analysis.\n\nThe Afridis and other Pashtuns of Afghanistan and Pakistan have also been alleged to be the descendants of the lost Jewish tribes such as the Efraim. However, DNA and other research towards validating such claims has been inconclusive.\n\nThe Afridi Tribe is sub classified into eight sub tribes listed below.\n\nAll Afridi clans have their own areas in the Tirah Valley, and most of them extend down into the Khyber Pass over which they have always exercised the right of toll. The Malikdin Khel live in the centre of the Tirah and hold Bagh, the traditional meeting place of Afridi \"jirgas\" or assemblies. The Aka Khel are scattered in the hills south of Jamrud. All of this area is included in the Khyber Agency. The Adam Khel live in the hills between Peshawar and Kohat. The Burki live in Kanigoram Valley, Waziristan and Peshawar. Their preserve is the Kohat Pass in which several of the most important Afridi gun factories are located.\n\nAll modern Afridis follow Islam. Their conversion to Islam is attributed to Sultan (Emperor) Mahmud of Ghazni by Ibbetson and Haroon Rashid.\n\nThe Afridis and their allies Khalils were first mentioned in the memoirs of Mughal Emperor Babar as violent tribes in need of subduing. The Afridi tribes controlled the Khyber Pass, which has served as a corridor connecting the Indian subcontinent with Afghanistan and Central Asia. Its strategic value was not lost on the Mughals to whom the Afridis were implacably hostile.\n\nOver the course of Mughal rule, Emperors Akbar and Jahangir both dispatched punitive expeditions to suppress the Afridis, to little success.\n\nThe Afridis once destroyed two large Mughal armies of Emperor Aurangzeb: in 1672, in a surprise attack between Peshawar and Kabul, and in the winter of 1673, in an ambush in the mountain passes. The emperor himself had to lead an army into the mountains to suffocate the revolt and liberate the mountain passes and even then, another large army was \"badly mauled\" in Bajaur.\n\nAllegedly, only five Mughals made it out of the battle alive.\n\nThe British connection with the Adam Khel Afridis commenced immediately after the annexation of the Peshawar and Kohat districts. Following the example of all the previous rulers, the British agreed to pay the tribe a subsidy to protect the pass. However, in 1850, 100p Afridis attacked a body of British sappers engaged in making a road, killing 12 and wounding 6. It was supposed that they disliked the construction of a road. An expedition of 3200 British troops was despatched, which traversed the country and punished them.\n\nWhen the Afridis of the Kohat Pass resisted, the Jowaki Afridis offered the use of their route instead; but they turned out more aggressive than the others, and in 1853, a force of 1700 British traversed their country and destroyed their stronghold at Bori.\n\nIn 1854, the Aka Khels Afridis, not finding themselves admitted to a share of the allowances of the Kohat Pass, commenced a series of raids on the Peshawar border and attacked a British camp. An expedition of 1500 troops entered the country and inflicted severe punishment on the tribe, who made their submission and paid a fine. \n\nIn 1877, the British government proposed to reduce the Jowaki allowance for guarding the Kohat Pass, and the tribesmen showed their resentment of this by cutting the telegraph wire and raiding into British territory. A force of 1500 troops penetrated their country in three columns in the Jowaki Expedition and did considerable damage by way of punishment. However, the attitude of the Jowakis continued the same, and their raids into British territory went on. A much stronger force, therefore, of 7400 British troops, divided into three columns, in 1877 and 1878, destroyed their principal villages and occupied their country for some time, until the tribe submitted and accepted government terms. The Kohat Pass was afterwards practically undisturbed. \n\nAt the time of the British advance into Afghanistan in 1878, during the Second Afghan War, the Zakka Khel opposed the British advance and attacked their outposts. A force of 2500 British troops traversed their country, and the tribesmen made their submission. The Afridis of the Khyber Pass continued to cause the British trouble during the progress of the Second Afghan War so another force of 3750 British troops traversed their country, and after suffering some loss the tribesmen made their submission. \n\nIn 1897, Afridis suddenly rose, captured all the posts in the Khyber held by their own countrymen and attacked the forts on the Samana Range near the city of Peshawar. The Tirah Expedition of the British forces followed, and negotiations for peace were then begun with the Afridis, who, under the threat of another expedition into Tirah in spring 1898, at length agreed to pay the fines and surrender the rifles demanded. \n\nIn February 1908, the restiveness of the Zakka Khel again made a British expedition necessary, but the campaign was speedily ended. \n\nMeat is an important part of their diet, which they often eat in the form of kabab (minced meat fried in oil), lamb curry, chicken curry or goat curry. The hotels in Peshawar Namak Mandi Bazar represent the traditional food of Afridis, especially lamb karahi. In vegetarian cuisine, traditional Indian ingredients such as \"bindi\" (okra), \"rajma\" (kidney beans), \"dal\" (lentils) and \"sag\" (spinach) are notably eaten. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39249280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39249280", "title": "Anti-organized crime institutions in Russia", "text": "Anti-organized crime institutions in Russia\n\nAnti-organized crime institutions in Russia are being developed. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, organized crime has taken control of many major sectors of Russia's state economy, society, and government. Most initiatives and institutions developed against organized crime groups have failed. Others, that have managed to remain standing, struggle in having any influence over the groups or cannot stop them, thus sitting idly without the ability to influence any crime. Due to the Russian government's continuous failure to curb organized crime, other nations such as the United States have tried to intervene and assist it in finding strategies.\nOrganized crime does not have a set definition that is recognized worldwide because every nation defines organized crime by different terms depending on their perceptions of variables such as culture and policy. In Russia, organized crime is defined by law enforcement authorities as, \"... an organized community of criminals ranging in size from 50 to 1,000 persons, which is engaged in systematic criminal business and protects itself from the law with the help of corruption.\" The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States defines organized crime as \"... a self-perpetuating, structured and disciplined association of individuals or groups, combined together for the purpose of obtaining monetary or commercial gains or profits, wholly or in part by illegal means, while protecting their activities through a pattern of graft and corruption.\" Federico Varese, a Professor in Criminology at the University of Oxford, offers yet another view of organized crime, particularly pertaining to mafia groups, \"a mafia group is a particular type of organized crime that specializes in one particular commodity [...] protection\".\n\nThe Communist Soviet Union collapsed after Mikhail Gorbachev tried to open the country via his policies of perestroika (1986) and glasnost (1988). While his actions brought the Soviet Union out of isolation from the international community, the initiatives are also seen as a failure because he tried to implement them too quickly. The shift from a state-run economy to a market economy was not gradual, it was abrupt. The nation was not ready for such a quick, drastic change. The new Russian Federation was forced into a market economy after decades of suppression and an entirely state-run economy. The new Russian state government did not have experience with democracy and could not smoothly transition to a democracy \"and\" market economy at the same time. Laws for this new type of state were not in place and when the government tried to enact some, they proved to be very hard to enforce as the population also did not yet understand how democracy and a market economy functioned. The chaos and fear that now plagued the Russian state opened the doors to a large increase in crime.\n\nVladimir Volkov, an Associate Professor of Sociology at the European University at St. Petersburg, cites some useful statistical data showing the immense upward trend of crime in the new Russian state, \"... in 1986 the militia registered 1,122 cases of extortion in Russia, in 1989 the number jumped to 4,621\". By 1996 there were a registered total of 17,169 cases of extortion. This number included \"only\" cases that were reported and responded to by militia; it is unknown how many cases were unreported. On the other hand, 1996 also saw crime plateau. The following years and in present day, there are not as many groups (although the groups that do exist are extremely powerful). Phil Williams showed the drastic increase in crime groups after the Soviet Union's collapse, \"... Russia has increased from 3,000 [criminal organizations] in the early 1990s to over 8,000 at the end of 1995...\"\n\nWith unsuccessful attempts at stifling organized crime, organized crime groups took control of a significant amount of large, vital, and previously state-owned corporations and businesses. Organized crime groups interrogated and exploited private business owners. If a business owner refused to agree to pay a crime group to protect his business, the crime group would simply kick him out of his own business or, as in the majority of cases, murder him and then take over the business themselves.\n\nBy the mid-1990s the Russian government realized that some type of effective action was needed if it wanted to avoid losing the entire Russian economy and society to organized crime groups. Hence, initiatives and decrees began to be developed and implemented, although with little success.\n\nIn the beginning of their struggle with organized crime, Russia did not try to seek foreign assistance. In recent times, however, it has actively sought foreign help to fight organized crime groups in the country. Even with aid, organized crime remains a serious problem. In fact, aid has offered very little actual help as programs are hard to follow through with and are usually simply dropped.\n\nBoris Yeltsin's government, the first government of the new democratic Russian state, was unable to curb crime in the administration. Instead it later turned out that almost all major government agencies and personalities had been linked to organized crime and/or corruption in some way.\n\nThe Russian government does not have the resources or dedicated individuals to combat crime. The State Duma has long been discussing legislative proposals but response has been weak. Due to the inability of the state to extinguish the criminal organizations, the population no longer trusts the government to get the protection they need. In fact, citizens can only depend on the organized crime groups to get any effective protection anymore of their homes, families, and businesses. Even official law enforcement agents have begun to partner up with the organized crime groups, because doing so has become one of the best ways to make money and stay safe.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs is the government agency in charge of combating organized crime. The agency has been around long before the collapse of the Soviet Union. A few of its branches include the \"militsiya\", the tax police, and the Organized Crime Control Department. The MVD always participates in any crime related investigations or actions in the Duma. Few members of the MVD have been known to be collaborators with organized crime.\n\nThe Federal Security Service (FSB) is the post-communist version of the Committee on State Security (KGB). They, like the MVD, and the KGB did, work against organized crime in Russia. Often the MVD and the FSB work hand-in-hand to try to stop crime. On the other hand, many FSB officials have been known to be corrupted and collaborating with organized crime groups.\n\nBy the mid-1990s Yeltsin's administration began to create some programs to try to alleviate their state of their organized crime problem. In 1995 then President Yeltsin met with the Security Council of Russia to hear reports administered by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) on the status of organized crime in the state. Results were obviously negative, showing a lot of crime with little enforcement against it. In a meager attempt to address the issue, Yeltsin ordered more funding and coordination among judicial bodies against organized crime. Nothing ever happened with this initiative.\n\nLater in 1995 Yeltsin made a very controversial attempt against crime. He created his own anti-crime law which allowed \"... the police broad authority to search premises, seize documents, investigate finances, and hold, for up to 30 days, people suspected of organized crime activity.\" \n\nIn July, the State Duma allowed the expansion of the amount of government agencies who could make investigations. Also in July, the Duma passed a law called \"On Fighting Organized Crime\" containing descriptions of what organized crime is and which organized crime groups are involved, along with 60 extra articles. The law was signed in by Yeltsin in 1996. Within its 60 articles it outlined how many years of prison organized crime groupmembers, government officials, and participants in organized crime should receive upon conviction. By the next year the new law seemed to disappear from memory and again nothing strict was being done about organized crime.\n\nThe Regional Anti-Organized Crime Directorate (RUBOP, RUOP, or UBOP) was created in 1992 to track and suppress organized crime groups. Several such regional anti-organized crime directorates were set up all over the country. These directorates served as \"an elite police force with extraordinary powers\". RUBOP also maintained a database of all listed organized crime groups and the individuals who participated in them. In 1996, however, the database was sold to private hands and was no longer updated.\n\nGeneral Aleksandr Lebed was the Security Council secretary in the Yeltsin administration. Lebed was a die-hard advocate of anti-organized crime institutions. Although he was quickly dismissed after Yeltsin became aware of a circulating rumor in 1996 of a potential military coup, Lebed enforced quite a few initiatives.\n\nLebed implemented new powers for his secretary position of the Security Council:\nFurthermore, Lebed forced Yeltsin to sign into law a decree, that amongst other things, allowed for sting operations against Moscow-area crime lords. The decree also included the following anti-organized crime actions:\n\n\nVladimir Putin has been a key government player since at least the year 2000. He is also an ex-FSB prime minister. When he was elected President in 2000 the first thing Putin did was grant himself and his family immunity from being prosecuted or investigated under the Presidential Decree Number 1763. On the other hand, Putin created a new security agency to fight organized crime called the Federal Service for the Investigation of Fight against Corruption (FSRBK). At the same time, in 2000, Putin threatened all Internet traffic when he authorized SORM-2, an eavesdropping network, to monitor all Internet traffic in real time.\n\nThe United States has been trying to help Russia find ways to battle organized crime groups since the early 1990s. However, its initiatives have tended to fall through because no one follows up after agreements or plans are made. Also, the Russian Federation often assured the United States that the crime was being taken care of successfully. The United States did not investigate the validity of that claim but just believed organized crime issues were truly being resolved. Since the 1990s, the United States government had steadily began to realize that Russia has been misguiding it. Hence, in recent times the United States has taken stronger action to assist Russia against organized crime.\n\nThe Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) is located in Washington, D.C. It was established in 1962 and concentrates on international public policy issues. CSIS seeks to analyze global challenges and shape policy decision in government and the private sector.\n\nThe following summary was compiled by the Russian Organized Crime Task Force, and published by CSIS, to assist the United States in proceeding with future assistance to the Russian government as they struggle to battle organized crime. Although the summary was compiled in 1997, the same recommendations still stand today.\n\nSummary of Recommendations \"for\" the United States Government\n\nThe following list has been copied from the Russian Organized Crime and Corruption: Putin's Challenge : Global Organized Crime Project Report, 2000 \n\n\nDue to bringing awareness of these suggestions, the Russian Organized Crime Task Force believes the fight against organized crime in Russia is becoming more influential and successful.\n\nAlso, in recent times, law enforcement agencies in Russia, Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States have tightened coordination and cooperation. In addition, Russia has steadily become more open and accepting of foreign help. Even more, organized crime problems are now being publicly spoken about in the new Russian Federation whereas before any government action or relationship to these criminal groups was kept secret. This opening to the public might be a sign of implementation of stronger actions in the near future.\n"}
{"id": "825165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=825165", "title": "Bakhtiari people", "text": "Bakhtiari people\n\nThe Bakhtiari () are a southwestern Iranian tribe, and a subgroup of the Lurs. They speak the Bakhtiari dialect, a southwestern Iranian dialect, belonging to the Lurish language.\n\nBakhtiaris primarily inhabit Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari and eastern Khuzestan, Lorestan, Bushehr, and Isfahan provinces. In Khuzestan, Bakhtiari tribes are concentrated primarily in the eastern part of the province in the cities of Masjed Soleyman and Andekah.\n\nA small percentage of Bakhtiari are still nomadic pastoralists, migrating between summer quarters (\"sardsīr\" or \"yaylāq\") and winter quarters (\"garmsīr\" or \"qishlāq\"). Numerical estimates of their total population vary widely.\n\nIn Iranian mythology, the Bakhtiaris are considered to be descendants of Fereydun, a legendary hero from the Iranian national epic, Shahnameh. They are also considered to be directly descended from Cyrus the Great. \n\nAccording to research into NRY markers, the Bakhtiari, as with many other groups in Iran, show very elevated frequencies for Y-DNA haplogroup J2—a phenomenon that is probably, at least partially, attributable to the Neolithic diffusion of early farmers from the Near East \"c\". 8000–4000 BCE. The Southwest Eurasian haplogroups F, G, and T1a also reach substantial frequency among Bakhtiaris.\n\nThe term \"bakhtiari\" can be best translated as \"companion of fortune\" or \"bearer of good luck\" The term has deep Persian roots and is the result of two smaller words \"bakht\" and \"yar\" complied together . \"Bakht\" is the Persian word for \"fortune\" and \"yar\", \"iar\", \"iari\" literally means \"companion\".\n\nThe latter designation largely relates to the nature of the tribe's annual \"migration\". This has to do with the harsh nature of Bakhtiari life and overcoming of countless difficulties that Bakhtiaris have faced in the Zagros ranges. In this sense, Bakhtiaris view themselves as a hardworking tribe, facing numerous obstacles everyday and yet fortunate enough to overcome each of these challenges as a solid unit.\n\nNevertheless, the origins of Bakhtiaris are ancient and it may have very well been the case that the tribe underwent a series of name changes throughout its history. However It is mostly claimed that the designation \"Bakhtiari\" came largely into use some time in antiquity.\n\nConstitutional Revolution:\nIn Iran's contemporary history, the Bakhtiari have played a significant role; particularly during the advent of the country's Constitutional Revolution (1905–1907). This event was largely secured through the Bakhtari campaign, which eventually deposed Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1907–1909). The Bakhtiari tribesmen, under the leadership of the Haft Lang khans Sardar Assad and his brother Najaf Qoli Khan Bakhtiari- Saad ad-Daula (also referred to as Samsam-os Saltane), captured Tehran and, as a result, saved the revolution. These events eventually led to the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1907–1909) in 1909 and his exile to Russia. This incident secured Saad ad-Daula the position of Prime Minister in the period that followed the abdication of the Qajar Shah. Nonetheless, with Russian backing, the Shah would soon return in 1911 by landing with a coalition of forces at Astarabad . However, his efforts to reclaim his throne would bear no fruit. In this sense, the Bakhtiaris played a critical role in saving the revolution from the Qajar forces.\n\nPahlavi Period:\nWith the expansion of Bakhtiari influence, urban elites (particularly in Tehran) began to worry in regards to a potential Bakhtiari takeover of Persia's affairs. Prior to this point, the Bakhtiari had largely remained within their own territorial boundaries.\nThe Bakhtiari influence would continue to play an important role within the early 20th century politics of Iran. Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925–1941) made the destruction of the Bakhtiari influence his mission. The existence of oil on Bakhtiari territory further motivated the Pahlavi monarch to undermine the\nautonomy of the tribe and force its population to adhere to the commands of the central government. He married as his second wife Soraya Esfandiari Bakhtiari, a member of the Bakhtiari tribe and family in his attempt to pacify the threat. . Reza Shah Pahlavi would eventually execute a few noteworthy tribal leaders to crush Bakhtiari autonomy and maintain control over the tribe. Amongst the executed Khans was Mohammad Reza Khan (Sardar-e-Fateh), the father of the man who later became the Pahlavi Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar. The latter event was a turning point for Bakhtiari and their rise within Iranian politics.\n\nThe Bakhtiari people are mainly from two tribal divisions, \"Chahar lang\" (English: Four Shares) and \"Haft Lang\" (English: Seven Shares). \"Lang\" word in bakhtiari dialect means \"share of tax or inheritance\". Due to the harsh nature of their life style, Bakhtiaris have been able to keep their blood lines intact, largely marrying within their own tribe.\n\nBakhtiaris trace a common lineage, being divided into the Chahar Lang (The Four Shares) and Haft Lang (The Seven Shares) groups, each controlled by a single powerful family. The overall khan alternates every two years between the chiefs of the Chahar Lang and the Haft Lang. They were supposed to pay taxes (in previous dynasties) and Haft Lang group had to pay more tax than Chahar Lang group.\n\nThe famous documentary \"Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life\" (1925) tells the story of the migration of Bakhtiari tribe from winter quarters in Khuzestan to summer quarters Chahar Mahaal. This film also tells the story of how these people crossed the river Karun with 50,000 people and 500,000 animals. The documentary \"People of the Wind\" (1975) retraces this same journey, 50 years later. The British documentary series \"The Ascent of Man\" (1973) in the first part of its second episode, \"The Harvest of the Seasons,\" also shows the Bakhtiari making the annual migration to the summer pastures. This portrayal is not however, particularly positive, using the Bakhtiari as an example of a pre-agricultural tribe frozen in time. As of 2006, the migration still takes place, although the livestock are now transported in trucks, and the shepherds no longer walk barefoot in the snow between provinces.\n\nThe Haft Lang:\nThe Haft Lang tribe is larger and much more significant than its Chahar Lang counterpart. The Haft Lang are primarily divided into four main sub-divisions, these include; Babadi, Dinaruni, Duraki and Bakhtiarwand. Most prominent Bakhtiaris are from these sub-divisions.\n\nCoalition between the two tribes:\nThe two clans shared ruling of their territories every two years. . They were also ruled from Isfahan but some moved to south during the fight with the central government and lived in the mountains area of Izeh, Ghalatoul, and Ramhormuz and Masjed-soluman. The Sassani ( Ali-Rahm Khan), Zanganeh ( Sons of Sardar Del-anchin), Rahim-zadeh, Jahangiri (sons of Aziz Khan) family who were mix of the two clans who lived in the area.\n\nThe Bakhtiari are noted in Iran for their remarkable music which inspired Alexander Borodin. The Bakhtiari dialect is the most popular dialect of the Lurish language.\n\nFAMOUS PHYSICIAN\n\n\n\n\n"}

The selection of bracero workers was a key aspect of the bracero program between the United States and Mexico, which began in 1942 and formally concluded in 1964. During this time, at least 4.8 million bracero workers entered into official labor agreements with U.S. contractors.\n\nThe first phase of selection for bracero workers took place at a local level in Mexico, which involved gathering required documentation for local officials. In addition to identifying documents, such as birth certificates, potential bracero workers had to obtain recommendations that would attest to their reliability and moral quality. Men would typically ask for recommendations from high-status local residents, such a politicians, clergy, or business owners. While the Mexican government’s publications asserted that required documentation was available free of charge, many aspiring workers had to pay local officials to gather the necessary paperwork and to be considered for selection. \n\nAfter several weeks of document collection, potential workers would congregate in a designated location, where the mayor and other prominent citizens would go through each man’s documentation and determine who could continue to the next phase of selection. If a person passed this local level of selection, their name would be placed on an official roster. These potential workers, along with the list, would travel to regional migratory stations.\n\nPeople who sought to enter the bracero program would travel to large cities in Mexico, where regional migratory stations comprised the second phase of selection. These processing centers were typically housed in stadiums or other large venues. Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of men would wait outside to hear their name called. Officials monitored the people waiting outdoors, and some carried weapons, such as a rubber truncheon. Local vendors, many of them women and children, sold concessions outside the processing centers.\n\nAfter a man heard his name called, he would enter the migratory station. In some stations, such as the Francisco Zarco Stadium in Durango City, a potential worker would walk through lines of armed soldiers on both sides when he entered. Then the applicant would proceed to an interview with local officials. Officials checked to see if the person had agricultural skills and would look at a potential laborer’s hands to see if they were callused, as a sign of their work in fields. Mexican women would type up information on bracero applicants at many migratory stations. \n\nPotential braceros would undergo physical examinations, where officials would assess physical fitness and ability. At some migratory stations, prospective braceros would receive a smallpox vaccination, while others would receive their vaccination later on at a U.S. Reception Center. If a person passed this phase, they would be fingerprinted and sent to the Department of Photography. Pictures would be taken for processing records and for an applicant’s crucial identification card, called a \"mica\". A \"mica\" offered documentation that the Mexican government had approved an individual for the program.\n\nPotential workers traveled from migratory stations to U.S. reception centers. The method of transportation varied. Some people went to migratory stations on buses, while others traveled on freight trains. On the trains that did not have restrooms, some aspiring workers fell off moving trains when they leaned out to go to the bathroom.\n\nUpon arrival at a U.S. reception center, officials from both U.S. and Mexican health departments would check the hands of potential braceros for calluses, repeating a procedure from the selection phase at migratory centers. People would proceed to a series of physical inspections, in which they would undress, and a doctor would examine them for venereal disease, illness, and lice. Potential workers would also be x-rayed to test for tuberculosis. Officials washed and sterilized clothing. Another procedure at U.S. reception centers was fumigation: potential braceros, while undressed, would be sprayed with DDT. DDT is an insecticide, which was banned in the early 1970s, due to environmental and health concerns, including carcinogenic and reproductive risks.\n\nAnother phase of selection was inspection by U.S. labor contractors. At U.S. reception centers, potential workers would typically line up and contractors would physically examine and question them. Some contractors reported that they looked for workers that would be deferential rather than subversive. Aspiring braceros would also receive a meal at the U.S. reception centers, where they sat at long tables in dining halls. Afterward men were photographed and assigned a number, and then directed to meet with contractors, who would outline the terms of the labor contract. Workers would receive a second \"mica\", which offered proof that the U.S. government had approved an individual to be part of the bracero labor program.\n\nWhen workers left the U.S. reception centers, many men would receive a bagged lunch and travel to farms on buses, which were usually old school buses. Some lunches were left behind and were described as virtually inedible. One \"New York Times\" article reported on a contractor giving bracero workers dog food.\n\nThe Mexican men that did not pass the selection process at U.S. reception centers were sent back to Mexico. Many of them had exhausted their financial resources acquiring the necessary documents to become a bracero worker, so numerous people returned home with little to no money.\n\nThe Visalia Opera Company, from a rural area in California, premiered a mariachi opera titled \"El Bracero\" in 2014. The opera traces the story of a bracero worker, Noe Prado, and his family and includes a scene on bracero processing. This portion of the opera emphasizes the experience of pesticide showers while being naked. Rosalinda Verde created the opera, infusing knowledge from her grandfather’s experience as a bracero worker.\n"}

The Muisca inhabited the central highlands (Altiplano Cundiboyacense) of what today is the country of Colombia.\n\nThe name of the language Muysccubun or \"muyskkubun\" in its own language means \"language of the people\" or \"language of the men\", from \"muyska\" / \"muysca\" (\"people\" or \"men\") and \"kubun\" / \"cubun\" (\"language\" or \"word\").\n\nImportant scholars who have attributed to the knowledge of the Chibcha language were Juan de Castellanos, Bernardo de Lugo, José Domingo Duquesne and Ezequiel Uricoechea.\n\nIn prehistorical times, in the Andean civilizations called preceramic, the population of northwestern South America happened through the Darien Gap between the isthmus of Panama and Colombia. Other Chibchan languages are spoken in southern Central America and the Muisca and related indigenous groups took their language with them into the heart of Colombia where they settled in their Muisca Confederation.\n\nAs early as 1580 the authorities in Charcas, Quito, and Santa Fe de Bogotá mandated the establishment of schools in native languages and required that priests study these languages before ordination. In 1606 the entire clergy was ordered to provide religious instruction in Chibcha. The Chibcha language declined in the 18th century.\n\nIn 1770, King Charles III of Spain officially banned use of the language in the region as part of a de-indigenization project. The ban remained in law until Colombia passed its constitution of 1991.\n\nModern Muisca scholars have investigated \"Muysccubun\" and concluded that the variety of languages was much larger than previously thought. The quick colonization of the Spanish and the improvised use of traveling translators has reduced the differences between the versions of Chibcha over time.\n\nSince 2009 an online Spanish-Muysccubun dictionary containing more than 2000 words is online. The project was partly financed by the University of Bergen, Norway.\n\n\nThe \"muysccubun\" alphabet consists of around 20 letters. The Muisca didn't have an \"L\" in their language. The letters are pronounded more or less as follows:\n\na - as in Spanish \"casa\"; ka - \"enclosure\" or \"fence\"<br>\ne - as in \"action\"; izhe - \"street\"<br>\ni - open \"i\" as in \"'inca\" - sié - \"water\" or \"river\"<br>\no - short \"o\" as in \"box\" - to - \"dog\"<br>\nu - \"ou\" as in \"you\" - uba - \"face\"<br>\ny - between \"i\" and \"e\"; \"a\" in action - ty - \"singing\"<br>\nb - as in \"bed\" - bohozhá - \"with\"<br>\nch - \"sh\" as in \"shine\", but with the tongue pushed backwards - chuta - \"son\" or \"daughter\"<br>\nf - between a \"b\" and \"w\" using both lips without producing sound, a short whistle - foï - \"mantle\"<br>\ng - \"gh\" as in \"good\" - gata - \"fire\"<br>\nh - as in \"hello\" - huïá - \"inwards\"<br>\nï - \"i-e\" as in Beelzebub - ïe - \"road\" or \"prayer\"<br>\nk - \"c\" as in \"cold\" - kony - \"wheel\"<br>\nm - \"m\" as in \"man\" - mika - \"three\"<br>\nn - \"n\" as in \"nice\" - nyky - \"brother of sister\"<br>\np - \"p\" as in \"people\" - paba - \"father\"<br>\ns - \"s\" as in \"sorry\" - sahawá - \"husband\"<br>\nt - \"t\" as in \"text\" - yta - \"hand\"<br>\nw - \"w\" as in \"wow!\" - we - \"house\"<br>\nzh - as in \"chorizo\", but with the tongue to the back - zhysky - \"head\"\n\nThe accentation of the words is like in Spanish on the second-last syllable except when an accent is shown: Bacata is Ba-CA-ta and Bacatá is Ba-ca-TA.\n\nIn case of repetition of the same vocal, the word can be shortened: fuhuchá ~ fuchá - \"woman\".\n\nIn Chibcha, words are made of combinations where sometimes vocals are in front of the word. When this happens in front of another vowel, the vowel changes as follows:\na-uba becomes oba - \"his (or her, its) face\"<br>\na-ita becomes eta - \"his base\"<br>\na-yta becomes ata - \"his hand\" (note: ata also means \"one\")\n\nSometimes this combination is not performed and the words are written with the prefix plus the new vowel:\na-ita would become eta but can be written as aeta, a-uba as aoba and a-yta as ayta\n\nCounting 1 to 10 in Chibcha is \"ata, bozha, mika, myhyká, hyzhká, ta, kuhupkwá, suhuzhá, aka, hubchihiká\". The Muisca only had numbers one to ten and the 'perfect' number 20; \"gueta\", used extensively in their complex lunisolar Muisca calendar. For numbers higher than 10 they used additions; \"hubchikiká asaqui ata\" (\"ten plus one\") for eleven. Higher numbers were multiplications of twenty; \"gue-hisca\" would be \"twenty times five\"; 100.\n\nThe subjects in Chibcha do not have genders nor plurals. to thus can mean \"male dog\", \"male dogs\", \"female dog\" or \"female dogs\". To solve this, the Muisca used the numbers and the word for \"man\"; cha and \"woman\"; fuhuchá to specify gender and plural:\n\nThe possessive pronoun is placed before the word it refers to.\n\n\nThe Muisca used two types of verbs, ending on -skua and -suka; bkyskua (\"to do\") and guitysuka (\"to whip\") which have different forms in their grammatical conjugations. bkyskua is shown below, for verbs ending on -suka, see .\n\n\n\n\n\nThis list is a selection from the online dictionary and is sortable. Note the different potatoes and types of maize and their meaning.\n\nWords of \"Muysccubun\" origin are still used in the departments of Cundinamarca of which Bogotá is the capital, and the department of Boyacá, with capital Tunja. These include \"curuba\" (Colombian fruit banana passionfruit), \"toche\" (yellow oriole), \"guadua\" (a large bamboo used in construction) and \"tatacoa\" (\"snake\"). The Muisca descendants continue many traditional ways, such as the use of certain foods, use of \"coca\" for teas and healing rituals, and other aspects of natural ways, which are a deep part of culture in Colombia.\n\nAs the Muisca did not have words for specific things in early colonial times, they borrowed them from Spanish, such as \"shoe\"; \"çapato\", \"sword\"; \"espada\", \"knife\"; \"cuchillo\" and other words.\n\nThe only public school in Colombia currently teaching Chibcha (to about 150 children) is in the town of Cota, about by road from Bogotá. The school is named \"Jizcamox\" (healing with the hands) in Chibcha.\n\nMost of the original Muisca names of the villages, rivers and national parks and some of the provinces in the central highlands of the Colombian Andes are kept or slightly altered. Usually the names refer to farmfields (\"ta\"), the Moon goddess Chía, her husband Sué, names of \"caciques\", the topography of the region, built enclosures (\"ca\") and animals of the region.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Chilean community on the Falklands are the biggest population from mainland South America and also the biggest non-British group representing over 6% of the total population according to the 2012 census, although the true number may be higher as many islanders of Chilean origin listed their national identity as 'Falkland Islander' and Chileans working on the islands temporarily were not counted in the census.\n\nA Chilean consulate was established on the Falklands in the 1870s and remained well into the 20th century. The first Chileans to arrive on the Falklands in large numbers came in the late 1970s, mainly from Punta Arenas and other parts of the Magallanes Region, with 28 permanent Chilean residents listed in the 1980 census. Following the Falklands War in 1982, Argentine nationals were banned from visiting the Falklands until the 1990s, which led to many Chileans (whose government had supported the UK during the war) moving to the Falklands to take up jobs previously held by Argentines. The permanent Chilean population remained fairly stable until the start of the 21st century when Chileans remaining on the islands for longer than 6 years rose to over 100. According to the 2012 census, there were 161 Chilean residents (82 women and 79 men) in Stanley and Camp, representing more than 10% of the civilian population, with an addition 20 Chileans listed as working at RAF Mount Pleasant, bringing the total number to 181 (6.2% of the total population).\n\nThe 2006 census indicated that about 157 Islanders had Chilean ancestry, nine were British Chilean, ten were of Falkland Islands-Chilean ancestry, there was one of Brazilian Chilean ancestry and another was Spanish Chilean.\n\nThe population speaks Chilean Spanish and Falkland Islands English and are prominently Roman Catholic. Most reside in Stanley, with a small number living in Camp and RAF Mount Pleasant. The influence of the Chileans can be felt in the local food with some bars serving typical Chilean cuisine and the islands receive most Chilean TV channels. Chilean Independence Day is also celebrated on the Falklands and since 2010 festivities have taken place with the Governor at Government House.\n\nThe main link between the Falklands and Chile is the weekly LAN Airlines between RAF Mount Pleasant, Punta Arenas and Santiago de Chile. The flights have been stopped for periods, most notably in 1999 when the Chilean Government banned the flight in protest to the UK's indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet. The weekly flight is also the only link between the islands and mainland South America and has become increasingly important since 2011 when the members of Mercosur banned Falklands flagged vessels from entering their ports in support of Argentine's claim to the islands. In 2011 Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner threatened to ban flights to the Falklands from flying over Argentine airspace, which led to protests by Chileans in the islands and Chile itself against Kirchner's proposals.\n\nChileans who have lived on the islands for more than seven years are entitled to apply for Falkland Islands status, considered to be the closest thing to citizenship that the Falkland Islands can grant, giving them full residency rights - although in order to vote they need to hold British, Irish or Commonwealth citizenship. Although the current Chilean government supports Argentine's sovereignty claim to the Falklands, the majority of the Chilean population on the islands and Mainland Chile support the Falkland Islanders' right to self-determination and in 2017 the Chilean-born Leona Vidal Roberts was elected to the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly.\n\n"}

{"id": "32333127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32333127", "title": "Culture of Kashmir", "text": "Culture of Kashmir\n\nThe culture of Kashmir refers to the culture and traditions of Kashmir, a region in northern India (consisting of Jammu and Kashmir), northeast Pakistan (consisting of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan) and the Chinese Occupied territory of Aksai Chin.\n\nThe culture of Kashmir is a diverse blend and highly influenced by northern South Asian, Persian as well as Central Asian culture. Along with its scenic beauty, Kashmir is famous for its cultural heritage; it amalgamates Muslim, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist philosophies and has involved composite culture based on the values of humanism and tolerance which is collectively known as \"Kashmiriyat\". Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh each have their own distinct culture.\n\nOne of the most important parts of the cultural identity of the Kashmiri people is the Kashmiri (Koshur) language. This language is spoken only in the Valley of Kashmir by the Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Muslims. Besides language, Wazwan and culture has been greatly influenced by Central Asian and Persian culture. Kashmiri is an Indo-Aryan (Dardic subgroup) language close to Central Asian Avestan-Persian. Cultural music and dance like \"Wanvun\", \"Roaff\", carpet/shawl weaving |Kaleenbafi and \"Koshur Sufiana\" forms a very important part of Kashmiri identity. Kashmir has witnessed many spiritual gurus who migrated from their land to Kashmir. Kashmir has also even witnessed the birth of some of the great poets and suifs of all time like \"Lal Daed, Sheikh-ul-Alam\", Habba Khatoon and many more; and is regarded as Peer Vaer (a place or land of spiritual gurus). It is important to note that Kashmiri culture is predominantly followed only in the Kashmir valley and Doda of the Chenab region. Jammu and Ladakh have their own distinct cultures that are very different from that of Kashmir.\n\nThe \"Dumhal\" is a famous dance in the Kashmir valley, performed by men of the Wattal region. The women perform the Roaff, another traditional folk dance. Kashmir has been noted for its fine arts for centuries, including poetry and handicrafts. \"Shikaras\", traditional small wooden boats, and houseboats are a common feature in various lakes and rivers across the Valley. Kashmiri culture is defined in terms of religious values, Kashmiri language, literature, cuisine and traditional values of mutual respect. The overwhelming majority of Kashmiris are Muslims and Islamic identity plays a very important role in the daily lives of people. Kashmiris across the religious divide have for centuries shared cordial and friendly ties. Kashmiri poets and writers like Mehjoor, Abdul Ahad Azad, etc. enriched the literature with their poetry. Kashmiri cuisine holds a unique place among different world cuisines. Salted tea or Noon Chai also called Sheer Chai is the traditional drink and is cooked in a Samavar, a Kashmiri tea-pot. Kashmir has been noted for its fine arts for centuries, including poetry and handicrafts. \"Shikaras\", traditional small wooden boats, and houseboats are a common feature in various lakes and rivers across the Valley. \"Kehwa\", traditional green tea with spices like cardamom, Saffron and almond, is served on special occasions and festivals. Kashmiri weddings are regarded incomplete without the Kashmiri traditional food known as Wazwan, which is typically spicy food cooked by the traditional cooks (Waz). Wazwan is a multi-course meal in which almost all the dishes are meat-based.\n\nCulture of Ladakh is famous for its unique Indo-Tibetan culture. Chanting in Sanskrit and Tibetan language forms an integral part of Ladakh's Buddhist lifestyle. Annual masked dance festivals, weaving and archery are an important part of traditional life in Ladakh. Ladakhi food has much in common with Tibetan food, the most prominent foods being thukpa, noodle soup; and tsampa, known in Ladakhi as \"Ngampe\", roasted barley flour. Typical garb includes gonchas of velvet, elaborately embroidered waistcoats and boots, and gonads or hats. People, adorned with gold and silver ornaments and turquoise headgears throng the streets during various Ladakhi festivals.\n\nJammu's Dogra culture and tradition is very different from the Kashmiri culture. The Dogra culture is instead much similar to that of neighbouring Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Traditional Punjabi festivals such as Lohri and Baisakhi are celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm throughout the region, along with Accession Day, an annual holiday which commemorates the accession of Jammu & Kashmir to the Dominion of India. After Dogras, \"Gujjars\" form the second-largest ethnic group in Jammu. Known for their semi-nomadic lifestyle, Gujjars are also found in large numbers in the Kashmir valley. Similar to Gujjars, \"Gaddis\" are primarily herdsmen who hail from the Chamba region in Himachal Pradesh. Gaddis are generally associated with emotive music played on the flute. The \"Bakkarwala\"s found both in Jammu and the outskirts of the Vale of Kashmir are wholly nomadic pastoral people who move along the Himalayan slopes in search for pastures for their huge flocks of goats and sheep.\n\nKashmir has a variety of meat based dishes like Rogan Josh, a lamb dish. Wazwan is a multi-course dish which is served on occasions like weddings.\n\nThe Kashmiri language is the main language spoken in Kashmir, although many other Indo-Aryan languages are also prevalent. Kashmiri literature has a rich history stretching back to hundreds of years.\n"}

Dagomba is the second most common language in the north, where other Gur languages such as Mossi and Gourma are also found.\n\nThe ethnic groups of the coastal region, particularly Ewe and Gen language (or Mina) (the two major African languages in the south), constitute the bulk of the civil servants, professionals, and merchants, due in part to the former colonial administrations which provided greater infrastructure development in the south. Most of the southern peoples use these two closely related languages, which are spoken in commercial sectors throughout Togo. \n\nThe Kabye live on marginal land and traditionally have emigrated south from their home area in the Kara region to seek employment.

More colloquially, elopement is often used to refer to a marriage conducted in sudden and secretive fashion, usually involving a hurried flight away from one's place of residence together with one's beloved with the intention of getting married.\n\nToday the term \"elopement\" is colloquially used for any marriage performed in haste, with a limited public engagement period or without a public engagement period. Some couples elope because they wish to avoid objections from parents, or religious obligations. In addition, the term elopement is used in psychiatric hospitals to refer to a patient leaving the psychiatric unit without authorization.\n\nIn England, a legal prerequisite of marriage is the \"reading of the banns\"—for the three Sundays prior to the intended date of the ceremony, the names of every couple intending marriage has to be read aloud by the priest(s) of their parish(es) of residence, or the posting of a 'Notice of Intent to Marry' in the registry office for civil ceremonies. The intention of this is to prevent bigamy or other unlawful marriages by giving fair warning to anybody who might have a legal right to object. In practice, however, it also gives warning to the couples' parents, who sometimes objected on purely personal grounds. To work around this law, it is necessary to get a special licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury—or to flee somewhere the law did not apply, across the border to Gretna Green, Scotland, for instance.\n\nIn the Philippines, elopement is called \"tanan\". Tanan is a long-standing practice in Filipino culture when a woman leaves her home without her parents' permission to live a life with her partner. Usually she will elope during the nighttime hours and is awaited by her lover nearby, who then takes her away to a location not of her origin. The next morning, the distraught parents are clueless to the whereabouts of their daughter. Tanan often occurs as a result of an impending arranged marriage or in defiance to parents' dislike of a preferred suitor.\n\n"}

Scenes included villas on a suburban street where a horse-drawn carriage was driven, the set of an operetta performed in the fictional country of Krasnia, shipboard skating and assassination scenes, the sinking of the ship, a bustling gypsy wedding and a Royal ballroom.\n\nThe musical was first performed in London in 1935. In 1937 it was adapted as a film of the same name starring Mary Ellis and Otto Kruger.\n\n\"Glamorous Night\" was produced by Ivor Novello. The musical opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London on 2 May 1935 to robust ticket sales, but had a limited run due to the pre-booking of a pantomime at the theatre. It then toured in the British provinces before re-opening at the London Coliseum in May 1936 for another short run, for a total of 234 London performances. The role of Anthony Allen was played by Novello, and that of the gypsy (Militza Hajos) was played by Mary Ellis. It was directed by Leontine Sagan, with choreography by Ralph Reader. The plot echoed current events in Rumania, where the king was willing to give up his reign to marry a Romany actress, Mme.

{"id": "28919492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28919492", "title": "Grievance (labour)", "text": "Grievance (labour)\n\nA grievance is a formal complaint that is raised by an employee towards an employer within the workplace. There are many reasons as to why a grievance can be raised, and also many ways to go about dealing with such a scenario. Reasons for filing a grievance in the workplace can be as a result of, but not limited to, a breach of the terms and conditions of an employment contract, raises and promotions, or lack thereof, as well as harassment and employment discrimination.\n\nAccording to Sean C. Doyle, in his work titled, \"The Grievance Procedure: The Heart of the Collective Agreement\", the grievance process takes on certain secondary roles in countries such as Canada, United States and the United Kingdom that can include, but are not limited to, \"a mechanism for the extension of the relationship between the parties, a union tactic to pressure management for strategic purposes, a diagnostic device to uncover underlying problems in the workplace, a mechanism for individual employees or union officials to challenge management over a range of working conditions, or even a forum for the communication of information\".\n\nA grievance between an employee and employer can be dealt with either informally or formally, and sometimes both approaches are taken in search of a resolution. In the informal approach, an employee can informally bring forth a concern promptly to his or her employer. Here a discussion or similar between the two parties can result in a mutually agreed upon resolution. In the case that this step fails or is skipped altogether, a grievance can be raised formally, where formal meetings and options for appeals become available.\n\nWorkplaces that have trade union representation often file a grievance with an employer on behalf of an individual employees request. According to the \"Union of Northern Workers\", \"Grievances are filed by the union on behalf of its members. Most of the grievances filed by unions are filed on behalf of individual employees (individual grievances) or on behalf of a group of employees (group grievances). A third type of grievance is the policy grievance which deals with issues that affect all employees\".\n\nIn the majority of cases, a grievance in a workplace is filed due to a breach of labour law. Though labour law can be different from country to country, there is a general understanding of this particular laws meaning and relationship to employees and employers. According to Peter Ackers and Adrian Wilkinson in their work titled, Understanding Work and Employment: Industrial Relations in Transition, labour law involved items can include, \"the contract of employment, regulatory legislation (such as health and safety measures), the conduct of industrial disputes, and questions of trade union government\". Going further, these authors also note the concern of labour law with three relationships in particular, that include, \"the relationship between the employer and the worker (a relationship rooted in contract - the contract of employment); the relationship between the employer and the trade union (a relationship rooted in tort - interference with trade, business or employment by unlawful means); and the relationship between the trade union and the worker (a relationship rooted in contract - the contract of membership)\".\n\nThough all three relationships are very different, they are all highly connected, especially in a situation where a grievance is filed by an employee or a union.\n\nAbove all else, a grievance is a procedure that allows for peace of mind, since knowing that there is a procedure in place to challenge questionable decisions that are made by others in the workplace is available. A grievance allows for an opportunity at conflict management with ideals such as fairness and equity at its forefront. Employees are able to have their say at all levels of management, with the opportunity to escalate to an independent arbitrator if necessary.\n\nWhile there are benefits for employees, management benefits from the presence of a grievance process as well. As Sean C. Doyle states in his work titled, \"The Grievance Procedure: The Heart of the Collective Agreement\", this is due to the fact that, \"the process represents an excellent means for achieving consistency in policy formulation and application and can ensure compliance with corporate policy by middle management and supervisors since their decisions are subject to the grievance procedure and will be reviewed by their superiors\". To be more specific, the grievance process often encourages the workplace contract to be quite specific, therefore it will encompass several events that can occur on a day-to-day basis. This creates clear expectations on both the part of an employee and employer, with the hope of a quick, but fair resolution.\n\nAs for the union, a grievance procedure can act as a way to nurture trust and loyalty between employee and the union. Since a grievance is usually a process that is supported by both employee and employer, there is always an understanding that this will be the route taken for conflict resolution within the workplace. When action must be taken, the union can play a significant role in the grievance process, and for this reason, it is important that they achieve a fair settlement for their clients, who are the employees, in order to gain further support and in some cases, re-election for company union representation.\n\nThough the grievance process does provide for a structured and often fair procedure to dealing with conflicts within the workplace, there are also certain disadvantages present. In some cases, employees and employers alike can see the inclusion of a third-party arbitrator as a way in which they lose specific rights or control over the situation. Another more obvious disadvantage is the use of time and money, which are both valuable resources to an organization. Often, a grievance does take a substantial amount of time to be completed, and therefore there is plenty of time used, while costs incurred during the investigation, and in particular through the inclusion of a third-party arbitrator can quickly add up. Another common disadvantage amongst employee and employer has to do with the notion of expectation. For instance, one party may prefer a quick resolution, while another may prefer to take their time and conduct a thorough investigation.\n\nUltimately a grievance process takes the attention of both the employee and employer away from their main roles in a workplace and shifts them elsewhere, while tensions between both parties can also form, resulting in future toxic environments or feelings.\n\nGrievance procedures can differ slightly from province to province, or state to state, though the process itself is quite similar whether it occurs in Canada or the United States.\n\nMost grievance cases feature a three to four step process. In a workplace that features a union structure, grievances begin with an employee bringing forth a particular issue or issues to their direct management source (usually in writing) within a specified period following the particular infraction. The issue is then in the hands of management who now has a specific period to respond personally or escalate the issue further to a higher authority. At this point, and sometimes even prior, a union representative enters the situation (if such structure exists) on behalf of the employee. If the situation cannot be resolved in an informal manner, or the preliminary stages of a formal grievance, the case is usually brought to an independent arbitrator. Since this is in many cases a last step in the process, the decision of an arbitrator is usually seen as final. A step that must be mutually agreed upon and one that is not always usual in the process is presenting the grievance to a mediator, who can assist the two or more sides solve their disagreement without having to go to arbitration. Mediation tends to cost both sides far less in terms of finances and time as opposed to the arbitration process.\n\nAn important piece of the grievance process in Canada and the United States revolves around timelines that must be met to ensure that a grievance remains active. Time limits are not always set, but they are in most cases, and this is why this is an important factor to highlight. In Canada for instance, a grievance must be filed within twenty five days of the occurrence being reported to a secondary party. This time limit excludes weekends and holidays that would usually be paid. An employer is required to respond to a grievance within ten days of its initial receipt. In many cases, if these set time limits are not adhered to, a grievance can be nullified. It is acceptable for an employee and employer to mutually agree upon extending certain deadlines past the above noted days allowable, though it is recommended to do so in writing.\n\nThe process of a grievance in the United Kingdom is not significantly different than the process used in Canada and the United States, however, the process will be outlined below.\n\nA grievance filed by an employer or employee should be submitted in writing. The next step involves a meeting between employee and employer. It is a statutory right for an employee to be able to bring a companion, but not just anyone, there are stipulations here; the companion must be a member of the union representing the employee, fellow co-worker or similar. If an employer or employee is unsatisfied following the meeting, there will be an opportunity to appeal the decision. In some cases, an appeal is held in-house by an impartial individual who may be employed by the same organization but had no previous involvement or bias in the case.\n\nIf not done correctly, workplace dismissal and the way in which it is handled can result in a grievance being filed. This specific case highlights a case of dismissal gone wrong. In 2009, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice rewarded a wrongfully dismissed employee named John Gordon Pate $550,000 in damages for his March 1999 dismissal.\n\nMr. Pate was Chief Building Official of the Corporation of the Township of Galway-Cavendish from 1989 until December 31, 1998. The Township of Galway-Cavendish had dismissed Mr. Pate based on an issue with his handling of building permit fees. The Township went one step further and asked the OPP to look into the matter and potentially lay criminal charges. This request by the township to the provincial police was well-received and led to a four-day long criminal trial. This trial ended in the dismissal of the former employees original charges.\n\nFollowing this particular ordeal, Mr. Pate in turn sued the Township for wrongful dismissal as well as malicious prosecution. He won on both charges. In November 2013, the Ontario Court of Appeal lowered the amount of damages awarded to Mr. Pate to $450,000.\n\nThis specific case involves an employee named Patricia Wilson and her employer Solis Mexican Foods. According to the specific case subsection on the \"Cassels Brock Lawyers\" website, \"This was the first Ontario court decision to award damages under the Human Rights Code.\" She was an assistant controller with the company as of January 2010, until the date of termination. A letter dated May 19, 2011 advised Ms. Wilson that she would be terminated due to the sale of a sector of the business that made several existing positions within the company superfluous.\n\nPrior to termination, Ms. Wilson, through her doctor had requested time off of work, dated March 7, 2011, in order to heal a recurring back issue. On March 28, 2011, once again through her doctor, Ms. Wilson informed her employer that she would be able to return to work on modified duties that included 4 hour work days beginning the week of April 4, with the promise of full 8 hour days commencing by April 18. The employer found this to be unacceptable and requested further information, which was promptly provided. One final twist in the lead up to the dismissal includes an unexpected letter from Ms. Wilson's doctor, which was dated April 28, 2011, simply stating that her client would need to be off of work until June 15, 2011. The case transcripts do not provide any further communication between this last request and the time of termination.\n\nThe specific case subsection on the \"Cassels Brock Lawyers\" website outlines the decision of this case when it states that, \"The Ontario Superior Court awarded $20,000 to the employee after finding that her ongoing back problems and related requests for accommodation were a factor in the employer’s decision to terminate, despite the employer’s argument that her termination was part of a corporate reorganization.\"\n"}

{"id": "27283898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27283898", "title": "Harari people", "text": "Harari people\n\nThe Harari people (, Harari: ሐረሪ), also called Geyusu (Harari: ጌይኡሱእ) (\"People of the City\"), are an ethnic group inhabiting the Horn of Africa. Members traditionally reside in the city of Harar, situated in the Harari Region of eastern Ethiopia. They speak Harari, a member of the Ethiosemitic language group within the Afroasiatic family.\n\nThe Harla people are considered, the precursor to the Harari people. Upon the arrival of Arab Fagih Abadir in the 10th century, he was met by the Harla, Gaturi and Argobba tribes. By the thirteenth century, Hararis were one of the administrators of the Ifat Sultanate. In the fourteenth century raids on Harar town of Get (Gey) by Abyssinian Emperor Amda Seyon I, Hararis are referred to as Harla Arabs. In the sixteenth century, walls built around the city of Harar during the reign of Emir Nur, helped preserve Harari identity from being assimilated by the Oromo. According to Ulrich Braukämper, Harla-Harari semitic group were most likely active in the region prior to the Adal Sultanate's Islamic invasion of Ethiopia. During the Abyssinian-Adal war, some Harari militia settled in Gurage territory forming the Silt'e ethnic group. Hararis were furious when Muhammad Jasa decided to move the Adal Sultanate's capital from Harar to Aussa in 1577. In less than a year after its relocation\nAdal would collapse.\n\nAmong the assimilated peoples were Arab Muslims that arrived during the start of the Islamic period, as well as Argobba and other migrants that were drawn to Harar's well-developed culture. The Oromo movement have effectively split this putative ethnolinguistic block to the Lake Zway islands, Gurage territory, and Harar. Following the decline of the Adal Sultanate's ascendancy in the area, a large number of the Harari were in turn reportedly absorbed into the Oromo community. In the Emirate of Harar period, Hararis sent missionaries to convert Oromo to Islam. The loss in the crucial Battle of Chelenqo marked the end of Harar's independence in 1887. Hararis supported the designated but uncrowned Emperor of Ethiopia Iyasu V, and his presumed efforts to make Harar the capital of an African Islamic empire. Iyasu was however overthrown in 1916, and many of his Harari followers were jailed.\nDue to severe violation of Harari rights during Abyssinian rule, Hararis made several attempts to cut ties with Ethiopia and unify Hararghe with Somalia. Launching the nationalist Kulub movement linked to the Somali Youth League. These events led to the Haile Selassie government's forced displacement efforts on Hararis, to break their dominant control of Harar. A Harar Oromo proverb alludes to this occasion as: \"On that day Hararis were eliminated from earth.\" Former Mayor of Harar Bereket Selassie reported that both the Amhara and Oromo viewed Hararis with contempt. Haile Selassie's overthrow by the Derg communist regime made minor differences for the Harari, they describe it as \"little more than a transition from the frying pan into the fire\". The surviving Harari relatives of the members to the Kulub movement would join the Somali Armed Forces and some having been promoted high-ranking military officers, fought in the Ogaden War to free Harari/Somali territory from Ethiopian rule. Hararis were also involved in WSLF. After Ethiopians won the war in Ogaden, Derg soldiers began massacring civilians in Harari areas of Addis Ababa for collaborating with Somalis. Today Hararis are outnumbered in their own state by the Amhara and Oromo people. The ruling Ethiopian government ushered in 1991 has favored Hararis tremendously. They now control their Harari Region again and have been given special rights not offered to other groups in the region.\n\nSome of the Hararis themselves assert descent from Abadir Umar ar-Rida, also known as \"Fiqi Umar\", who traced his lineage to the first caliph, Abu Bakr. According to the explorer Richard Francis Burton, \"Fiqi Umar\" crossed over from the Arabian Peninsula to the Horn of Africa ten generations prior to 1854, with his six sons: Umar the Greater, Umar the Lesser, the two Abdillahs, Ahmad and Siddik. According to Hararis, they also consist of seven Harla subclans: Abogn, Adish, Awari, Gidaya, Gaturi, Hargaya, and Wargar. The Harari were previously known as \"Adere\", although this term is now considered derogatory.\n\nThe Harari people speak the Harari language, an Ethiosemitic language referred to as \"Gey Ritma\" or \"Gey Sinan\" (\"Language of the City\"). It is closely related to the eastern Gurage languages and similar to Zay and Silt'e.\n\nAfter the Egyptian conquest of Harar, numerous loanwords were additionally borrowed from Egyptian Arabic. The Harari language was historically written using the Arabic script. More recently, it has been transcribed with the Ge'ez script.\n\nThe 1994 Ethiopian census indicates that there were 21,757 Harari speakers. About 20,000 of these individuals were concentrated outside Harar, in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa.\n\nMost Harari people are bilingual in Amharic and Oromo, both of which are also Afro-Asiatic languages. According to the 1994 Ethiopian census, about 2,351 are monolingual, speaking only Harari.\n\nVirtually all Harari are Muslim. The earliest \"kabir\" or Islamic teacher in the community was Aw Sofi Yahya. He arrived in Harar in 1216 as part of Abadir's retinue. Yahya subsequently established the area's first \"Qur'an gey\" or madrasa around to the south of the city center.\n\nHararis comprise under 10% within their own city, due to ethnic cleansing by the Haile Selassie regime. Thousands of Hararis were forced to leave Harar in the 1940s. Harari people moved throughout Ethiopia, mainly to Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, establishing families and businesses. The Harari people have also spread throughout North America, mainly to Washington D.C., Atlanta, Toronto, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Memphis. Furthermore, a minority of the Harari people live in Europe in countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Great Britain. In Melbourne Australia, Harari communities such as Sây Harari Afocha are active.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39231341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39231341", "title": "Iatmul people", "text": "Iatmul people\n\nThe Iatmul are a large ethnic group of about 10,000 people inhabiting some two-dozen politically autonomous villages along the middle Sepik River in Papua New Guinea. The communities are roughly grouped according to dialect of the Iatmül language as well as sociocultural affinities. The Iatmul are best known for their art, men's houses, male initiation, elaborate totemic systems, and a famous ritual called \"naven\", first studied by Gregory Bateson in the 1930s. More recently, the Iatmul are known as a location for tourists and adventure travelers, and a prominent role in the 1988 documentary film \"Cannibal Tours\".\n\nIn Iatmul legend, the original condition of the world was a primal sea. A wind stirred waves, and land surfaced. A large pit opened, and out emerged the first generation of ancestral spirits and culture-heroes. The ancestors then embarked on a series of mythic-historic migrations. Where they trod, land appeared. Along these routes, the ancestors created the world through naming. Literally, they named all the features of the world into existence—trees, mountains, stars, winds, rains, tributaries, villages, actions, virtually everything in the world. These names are called totemic names. They are claimed by specific patrilineal groups (clans, lineages, and branches). Totemic names are magical, and form the basis for the religious system.\n\nAccording to the Iatmul, the primal pit is located near the Sawos-speaking village of Gaikarobi. After emerging from the pit, most ancestors travelled to the village of Shotmeri. From there, they dispersed throughout the region, eventually arriving in each village inhabited today.\n\nEach Iatmul community consists of clans, lineages, and \"branches.\" Membership into a group is conferred at birth through the father, what anthropologists call patrilineal descent. Every village has its own cluster of groups; no two villages consists of the exact same clans and lineages. Each group tells its own ancestral history of migrations through the region. These tales are encoded in long chains of complex polysyllabic names called \"tsagi\" that are known only to ritual specialists. When \"tsagi\" are chanted during rituals, the names evokes ancestral migrations and different places and features of the landscape created by the group's mythic ancestors during their long-ago travels.\n\nThe word \"Iatmul\" was coined by Gregory Bateson during his initial period of anthropological research among the language group in the late 1920s. In his 1932 article in the journal \"Oceania\", Bateson wrote that he \"adopted the name Iatmul as a general term for the people. But I doubt whether I am right in so doing.\" In Mindimbit village, he reported, local people referred to the entire linguistic group with the compound phrase \"Iatmul-Iambonai\". The word \"Iambon\" (pronounced Yambon) referred then, and still does, to the upper-most Iatmul-speaking village along the river. \"Iatmul\" referred only to a single, small clan. The use of the word Iatmul, then, to signify the entire group, was Bateson's convention, and it thereafter gained anthropological and wider currency. However, the term is rarely used by Iatmul speakers. In fact, Iatmul speakers rarely have reason to refer to the entire language group. The Iatmul are not a centralized tribe. They never act politically, socially, or economically as a single unit. Villages are autonomous. People tend to self-identify not as Iatmul or, as they sometimes say, Iatmoi, but in terms of their clan, lineage, village, or sometimes just the colonial-era regional term, Sepik.\n"}

{"id": "16784952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16784952", "title": "Kyariaūman", "text": "Kyariaūman\n\nA is a Japanese term for a career woman. The term refers to the type of Japanese woman, married or not, that pursues a career to make a living and for personal advancement rather than being a housewife without occupation outside the home. The term came into use when women were expected to marry and become housewives after a short period working as an \"office lady.\"\n\nThe term is used in Japan to describe the counterpart to the Japanese salaryman (サラリーマン); a career woman in Japan also works for a salary, and seeks to supplement their family's income through work or to remain independent by seeking an independent career.\n\nIn the early history of Japan, the status of women were higher as they were thought to have the special ability to communicate with spiritual or divine beings known as \"kami\". The Japanese sun deity, Amaterasu, was female and reflects the sacred role of women in traditional Japanese matriarchal society. The social status of women began to decline in the beginning of the Muromachi period (1336). Following the Muromachi age and well into the late 1800s, women still received equal treatment compared to men in many areas. They were granted freedom of marriage, love, and equal treatment in regards to work, as they worked under much the same conditions as men.\n\nWomen of the elite classes were bound by a newly reformed version of Shinto, with heavy influences of Confucianism. Under the Confucian ethic of \"three obediences\" women were expected to show subservience to their fathers as girls, to their husbands as wives, and to their children in old age. This began the traditional Japanese image of the \"Good Wife, Wise Mother\" in which women were supposed to remain as housewives after marriage, caring for the household, cooking, sewing, and being subservient to their husbands. This, however, only proved a problem for women in the working world during the Meiji era (1868–1912). Despite class distinctions being abolished, Confucian ethics had penetrated into the culture, robbing women of most of their equal status. Women on farmlands still maintained some level of freedom with work, tending the fields with their husbands and children. Throughout the modernization of Japan, women were denied many of their rights, including the right to work in jobs filled primarily by men, to be paid comparably, and to work in a system that rewarded talent over seniority and sex.\n\nDuring the Meiji era, Haru Hiratsuka took up the pen name Raicho Hiratsuka and founded the first all-women literary magazine called \"Seitō\", with a number of other like minded contributors. Seitō was published in 1911 with 134 pages at the start and only 1,000 copies were printed, but the launch of the magazine began the feminist movement in Japan. Hiratsuka herself stated in her first essay, \"In the beginning, woman was truly the sun. An authentic person. Now she is the moon, a wan and sickly moon, dependent on another, reflecting another's brilliance.\" Indicating that women had fallen from their position of power as representations of the divine and were made subservient, reflecting the grandeur of others, becoming practically invisible on their own.\n\nIn the era of Westernization, more women were becoming educated and began to demand for their legal rights. Female leaders began to emerge in various positions in limit scale. The declining workforce in the aftermath of the First World War encouraged women to march for their equal rights. Though \"Seitō\" remained active only through 1915, Hiratsuka became a powerful figure to women everywhere in Japan. \n\nOne of her most important reforms, in 1919, was the petition to revise Article 5 of the police security regulations put into law in the year 1900. This severely limited the ability for women to attend political meetings or gather political information, which, as Hiratsuka noted, put working women at a disadvantage, because being politically knowledgeable was a partial necessity to have any hope of employment in the male dominated work force (men).\n\nDuring the Second World War, there were major shortage of domestic workforce as majority of the men were drafted to join the military. Women, who had been primarily relegated to office work or more likely, bound to the home, began to seek employment to supplement their husband's military incomes. This led to a small expansion of their capabilities. The influx of working women into the manufacturing industry to aid the war effort proved invaluable to the Japanese economy. \n\nFollowing World War II, men returned home to start work again, but women were reluctant to return to being housewives. During this postwar state, Japan was in a hurry to gain economic strength to match the west and women were a vital part of the labor force. Though their roles were still limited, many favoring secretarial work as office ladies, women could work in retail, typically if their family owned stores, they could work as teachers, or in the manufacturing industry. Japanese women did manage to make a small stride forward in 1947, with the passing of the Japanese Labor Standards Law. With this in place, working women were given special treatment, restricting their ability to work overtime, on dangerous jobs, on night jobs, and allowing leave during menstruation periods. Though harmful for women seeking equal footing with men in the job world, it protected the majority of early career women who intended to marry. \n\nWhen the recession hit in the mid-70's, the government began to support women workers as a way to bolster the economy. This began the famous M-Curve, which was a graph of the working age of women. Before marriage and after their children were raised proved to be the times women sought out employment, with a dip in between the two for child rearing. This roughly formed an M when charted graphically and the M-curve became the primary reference for working ages of Japanese women to this day. Despite the apparent support of Japanese women's new found independence, part-time pay for Japanese women was only 61% of a man's wages, gradually worsening as the 70's drew on. \n\nBy the early 80's 45.8% of women aged fifteen and above were in the labor force, the women population of Japan comprising roughly 37.4% of the entire work force. During this time, unmarried women did not make up the majority of the Japanese work force. Women age 36 and above accounted for a much larger percentage. Women who were home bound during this period also used piecework at home as a way of supplementing the family's income. Though the pay for this was incredibly poor, accounting for only a bare bones 25,000 yen per month.\n\nBy the year 2000, 40.7% of the total Japanese work force were female workers, with 56.9% of those women being married, indicating the path of career woman was not just open to the single women of Japan. By the end of the 1990s, women were concentrated in light manufacturing work, such as food production, as well as tertiary industries, like retail business, restaurants, and financing companies. In Japan, the idea of a part-time worker is someone who works for a set period, with no bonuses or fringe benefits. Many employers used part-time women workers as supplementary labor with no chance of advancement and unstable job security.\n\nDespite some legislation passed in 1985 to ensure equality, both the Equal Opportunity Law, which prohibits discrimination, and the Child-Care Leave Law, which gives parents unpaid leave to tend to children, then return to their old position or a similar one, lacked any real power to drive change. No penalties were issued for companies that ignored this, meaning, only women who take on the same burden as male employees, of working full-time, with no breaks for pregnancy or child rearing, are able to have any hope of advancement. Boards of directors, public servants, and judiciary branches of work are typically closed to any career woman not willing to work full-time and overtime regularly. The largest part of the labor force are not the full-time career women, but housewives who work part-time, supplementing the household budget. In fact, the government discourages housewives from making too much money, because if housewives make a certain amount, they lose their husband's dependent allowance. \n\nThis limits the jobs women can do while married. In many instances of the Japanese work force, women who wish to receive equal pay and chances at promotion are expected to act like their salaryman counterparts. This is indicative of one of the problems women face when seeking employment in Japan. While equal in part, they still face discrimination. Many businesses lack the flexibility to offer work which fits the irregular schedules of housewives. There have been some strides forward however. The equal employment legislation of the 1980s did prohibit discrimination in the training, benefits, retirement, and dismissal, however, not in recruitment, hiring, or promotion.\n\nSince 1991, Japan has undergone a protracted recession known popularly as the Lost Decades. After the real estate boom from 1986 to 1991, also known as the bubble economy, where a strong economy resulted in strong demand for and low unemployment, the Lost Decades resulted in drastic cutbacks among Japanese employers, causing a large increase in unemployment. Despite signs of recovery in the mid-2000s, the 2008 global economic recession has protracted these issues. Among this macroeconomic situation, large changes have been occurring within the Japanese economy that has changed the role of the working woman in Japan. Radical changes in government policies and focus has resulted in increased social care and the creation of dual-sector employment, which have affected female employment and the working housewife. \n\nChallenges to the dominant male breadwinner model has led to changing social perspectives on the traditional role of the wife in providing familial care, although discrimination and stereotypes remain rampant. The creation of the double-track personnel management strategy in response to government affirmative action policies has contributed to the lack of women in management and gendered roles in the office.\n\nThe Lost Decades forced a radical change in legislation as the government was now dealing with major declines in the economy and the competitiveness of Japan in the world markets. Neoliberal trade liberalization policies resulted in increasing competitive pressures on Japanese companies, forcing many to reduce labor costs. The 1998 and 2003 revision of the Labor Standard Law and the 1999 Worker Dispatching Law allowed for easier dismissal of workers and relaxed regulations regarding hiring practices, along with the aforementioned Equal Opportunity Law. \n\nAs part-time workers, commonly known as freeters, are far less expensive than the traditional full-time lifelong worker whose wages traditionally increased with age, Japanese companies drastically increased the proportion of part-time workers to full-time workers. Among young adult workers, the percentage of full-time employees dropped from 90% in 1988 to 54% for a single, high-school educated female. Females are more significantly affected by development, as males are still able to maintain a higher ratio of full-time employment. The full-time employment rate of high-school educated males was at 78% in 2008 as compared to 75% for university educated females. As part-time workers receive lower wages, less employment protection and little benefits, female workers experience marginalization.\n\nAs decreases in job security and wages for males have negatively impacted the ability of the sole male-breadwinner family model, there is now increasing pressure for women to work outside the home in a dual-earner family model. The percentage of young women who believed that a man should work outside a home and that women should work inside dropped from 41.6% in 1997 to 27.8% in 2008, while for men the rate went from 40.7% to 34.3% respectively. Similarly, the proportion of young women who expected to work until retirement rose from 15.3% in 1987 to 24.7% in 2010, while the proportion of men who expected their wives to do so rose from 10.5% to 32.7% in the same time period. The increasing acceptance of young Japanese adults of the dual-earner model has resulted in an increase of dual-earner young households from 32.4% in 2000 to 42.8% in 2009. \n\nWomen are also delaying or avoiding marriage altogether. The mean age of first marriage rose from 24.2 in 1970 to 28.8 in 2010, while the proportion of women aged 25–29 who have not married increased from 18.1% in 1970 to 60.3% in 2010. The education levels of young women are also drastically increasing, at a rate higher than their male counterparts. 45.2% of women in 2010 progressed to university from high school, a dramatic increase from 15.2% in 1990. These changes in Japanese society have narrowed the wage gap between men and women, as wages of female 25–29 years old have reached 88% of their male counterparts in 2007, as opposed to 76% in 1981. However, a large part of this reduction in the wage gap is due to the stagnation of male wages, which was at the same levels in 2007 as in 1991.\n\nA key issue that remains is the lack of female representation in management. Of all legislators, senior officials and management, females are found in only 9% of the positions. This disparity has contributed to the larger overall gender wage gap of females earning only 66.5% of male earnings in 2002. Prevalent social opinions suggest that this disparity is due to the lack of commit of Japanese women to their jobs due to their perspectives regarding marriage, family, and children. \n\nWhile the government had imposed the Equal Opportunity Law in 1986, companies responded by creating a ‘double-track management system’ (DPM), where a career track allows for promotions but requires transfers, and a non-career track that does not require transfers but has low chances of promotion. Previously, employers often maintained a core workforce mainly consisting of male employees which was expected to work at head office and be transferred around the world, and a peripheral workforce of female employees working at local branches with restricted career advancement. \n\nUptake by females of the career track is extremely low at less than 4% in all industries. Given the strong internal labor market of Japanese companies which stipulates that senior positions are only given to those in the career track and not from sources external to the company, this has contributed to the low proportion of female managers. This DPM system is also prevalent, especially among larger firms, with 51.2% of firms with more than 5,000 employees using the system. \n\nGendered divisions exist in the workplace and are replicated by both male and female workers. Although both genders may be allocated to the same section, males were often trained and allocated towards management jobs. As a result, female workers often were not in or chose not to be in management jobs due to lack of training, experience, and opportunity. In addition, more than half of surveyed companies indicated that they were attempting to eradicate instances of sexual harassment and discriminatory practices by males towards female workers, indicating an existing environment of a male-dominated workplace.\n\nIn the 21st century, though women still face some degrees of discrimination in the Japanese job market, there have been a number of companies that both foster women's equality and reward them on a talent based system. New fields, such as banking, journalism, insurance sales, and advertising; companies in the information industry, are very appealing to women, because they reward them based on individual ability. These companies are also keen to rotate workers out every two or three years, giving women the opportunity to explore a number of different departments without job hopping, fostering trust in the company and versatility in the women workers.\n\nAside from the information industry, several foreign companies have taken an interest in Japan. The companies provide Japanese women, who have some foreign language proficiency, work in challenging fields with pay comparable to their male counterparts. Women also have a better chance of promotion to managerial positions in foreign companies and are hired based on their skills, rather than potential abilities that can be mastered through on the job training, as is popular with Japanese firms. These alternatives may often lack the job security that can be found at large Japanese companies, but they reward women based on talent rather than seniority, provide better chances for promotion, and offer a greater challenge to working women.\n\n\"Women have a mysterious power, despite not being used to their full capacity, due to their desire of marriage over lifetime employment. They do, however, often work as message carriers, or in secretarial positions that allow them to act as emotional propagandists for the company, hearing secrets of workers and internal affairs.\"\n\nThis stereotype was still prevalent, even in the 1980s. To many, women were only ephemeral creatures, working briefly before settling down for marriage, where their only real use was as window dressings or as a company's emotional propagandists. In a predominantly patriarchal society, women largely went unnoticed in the workforce, due to unfair stereotypes of their positions. Ethnographers also noticed this, stating that women have a great well of power, equal or greater to that of Japanese men, in terms of will, bravery, and psychological strength, despite being undervalued as members of the work force. Several stereotypes are prevalent in media and are often what Japanese working women are associated with.\n\nSometimes called \"ochakumi\" or tea fetchers, this job revolves around women who are specifically hired or requested to serve tea or coffee to their co-workers and executives, sometimes expected to arrive at the office early to tidy up, similarly to a housewife. This type of work was rooted in the early 1900s, when the office was a different place to work and women were expected to be supporters of men. This position is not only limited to women, however. Women in managerial positions can be served by lower ranked men in some cases.\n\nWhile comparable to geisha, these women make livings entertaining business men, often spending large amounts of their work time with them. Hostesses, however, can choose this path, rather than being sold into it, like a brothel girl from the Meiji era. This type of work borders on the sex industry, with women being paid to amuse men who eat and drink at night clubs, salons, taverns, etc. Though the hours are irregular, the pay is very good for women willing to work in this sector, some of whom even aspire to own their own private establishments. Due to the odd nature of this work, though, this type of employment is usually only sought by divorcees, young unmarried Japanese women, or married women in need of quick cash. \n\nHostesses will often play the part of a mother or housewife for male customers, caring for them, inflating their ego, and flirting with them, offering bits of flattery for tips. Depending on the size of the bar, night club, etc., there may be a large show to relax the customers; or in smaller establishments, the hostess will spend one-on-one time with her clients, gaining social ties while charging her clients for their attention. Though it can be a good source of quick money for women willing to work odd hours, normally single women with a low education, usually around the high school level, are the primary hostess candidates. They work late into the nights and sleep during the days, so these women are close to opposites of the salarymen they entertain. In the 21st century, this type of industry has drastically evolved. Pictures of kimono clad hostesses or hostesses willing to dress up in costumes for the amusement of customers have become an iconic image for tourists.\n\nOften nicknamed \"shokuba no hana\" or \"office flower,\" these women suffered discrimination due to the M-Curve. Office ladies were usually hired right after high school or junior high, with university graduates discouraged from pursuing this type of career. They were kept around the office for the youth they brought to it, hence the \"flower\" nickname. They were charged with routine, menial tasks meant to support the male workers. This type of career offered very little chance of advancement and was specifically designed so that women would leave for marriage before their thirties. Women between the ages of twenty-four and twenty-eight would often be advised to settle down as a subtle message to quit, as those years were considered the most suitable for marriage.\n\nJapanese women will sometimes be forced to take jobs after marriage to supplement their husband's income, however, some women are unable to work, because of the lack of domestic support at home. Husbands seldom help with the housework, forcing women to stay home rearing children and taking care of domestic tasks. many believe a good housewife's job is to stay at home and look after the house. Housewives may allow their husband to help in some small tasks, however, they are worried if they see their husband taking too much time to do domestic chores. Housewives believe the house is their charge and do not want their husbands accusing them of neglecting their responsibility. \n\nJapanese women overall completed 95% of unpaid housework, while among full-time workers women still completed 60% of the housework, an unparalleled proportion among OECD countries. In 2000, 84.6% of women and 88.5% of men agreed that women should still be responsible for household jobs although it is good to have employment. In 2004, 67.4% of new mothers left their previous job for their first birth.\n\nWith a rise in feminism, more cases of sexual harassment are being reported from Japanese women in the workplace and on commutes to work. Two types of sexual harassment have gain widespread fame in the workplace and are being addressed. The first revolves around a woman being fired, or demoted due to a refusal to offer sexual favors to her superior. This is called retaliatory. The second revolves around an environment that is denigrating to female workers, including sexual comments, lewd pictures, or inappropriate actions by male co-workers in the workplace. This is called environmental. Despite these being addressed, due to ambiguities in the legal framework, these types of harassment can be hard to enforce. Women are bringing it to the public's attention through attempts to speak out against the injustice, however, many remain silent, fearing they will be fired if they speak out. This hurts their performance, undermining the idea of equality in the workplace. \n\nSexual harassment can be a double edged sword in the workplace. Some women reported that men who are caught sexually harassing female co-workers are laughing stocks. Based on the Japanese idea of shame, some men, especially in large corporations, avoid sexual harassment at all costs to preserve their position. Also, the opinions of men can vary greatly from department to department. Women harassed in one department can meet with no resistance after being transferred. Men's opinions of women in Japan vary greatly, primarily due to their experiences with women. Apart from their wives, mothers, and hostesses that salarymen spend time with, men live in separate spheres than women, so many are uneducated in the best ways to act.\n\nDespite improvements to health, education, and overall employment in 21st century postwar Japan, career women suffer from a large bit of gender inequality. Japan has the largest wage gap between men and women and the smallest proportion of female managers, females enrolled in higher education, and women who hold parliamentary seats among the other industrialized nations of the world. In terms of equal wages, Japan offers women even less than their male counterparts compared to its less developed neighbors. Women in China, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam all make a higher percentage of wages than Japanese women. Japan lags far behind in terms of financial equality, despite other improvements over the years.\n\nDivorce rates have risen in Japan since the 1980s, the spread of feminism weakening the stigma that is often associated with divorce. Women in the workplace are now more capable of leading an independent life from their husbands and see divorce as an act of autonomy. Despite this, some women cannot financially afford divorce and there have been several attempts to suppress divorce rates over the years. Women without a steady income are unlikely to gain joint ownership of property and cannot acquire loans for a new home.\n\nWomen are also more likely to gain custody of the children, but have a difficult time getting the father to share in the costs of rearing them. Due to the family registration system, it is much harder for divorced women or men to remarry. In these cases, women may choose to avoid divorce for the sakes of their children, despite it being the better option. If a woman does not already have a steady income, divorce is seldom a viable option, despite younger women seeing it as the better option.\n\nFollowing World War II, Japan was left with a shortage of skilled workers and a surplus of unskilled workers. To try to make the best of this situation, the seniority system was instituted in the Japanese workplace, which still persists today. The idea of a salaryman comes from this system. With the seniority system, workers were valued for lifetime contributions to their employers, who offered wage increases and promises of promotion depending on the number of years worked. Women were not seen as wise investments in this system, due largely in part to the M-curve which showed they primarily worked before marriage, then after their children were grown, taking a large span of time in between for child rearing. Women were relegated to part-time workers, or temporary workers who could be laid off during economic down turns. \n\nEven with the seniority system, women were still vital to the work of many companies. In Tokyo, to attract more women, a semi-managerial track was adopted to work hand in hand with the seniority system. This track offered women a chance for advancement based on performance, rather than lifetime employment. Tests for promotion in this track could be grueling and the positions were limited due to the economic burden of paying a managerial salary. Many Japanese women had to come to terms with taking on heavier responsibilities as well, working late into the night, sometimes alone.\n\nIshihara Ichiko was the first Japanese woman to be appointed to an executive post; holding the position of executive director of Takashimaya department store. She was famous for her slogan, \"Think like a man, act like a lady, and work like a dog.\" Ichiko managed to rise to the top of the department store industry by working extensive overtime hours, while reporting she'd left at the designated quitting time, so the company would not have to pay her overtime. In this manner, she was able to prove her worth to the company without being an economic drain on them. She used her female perspective to boost sales in kitchenware departments; while initiating bold new ideas and change along the way. \n\nIchiko is one of the most prominent career women, working as hard, or harder, than the typical salaryman, while using her skills over seniority to advance. She was able to go far in the department store business because in the 1980s, it was realized that even if housewives didn't work, they were largely in charge of the family budget and marketing to them would be wiser than the \"For men only\" idea of business. Using a feminine perspective to appeal to female clients, while putting in the effort of working massive hours of unpaid overtime, Ichiko was able to prosper from her skill in a system based on seniority that frequently discriminated against women. While this path of career woman is much more arduous than the part-time or temp work that many women seek and offers little real promise of reward, it is a testament to the power of a career woman, to beat the system.\n\nOwner and manager of the Shokado women's bookstore in Osaka, Toyoko has been a very outspoken feminist. Toyoko is the sole owner and only worker in the bookstore, but her store has become a hub of feminist activity. In the 1980s, Toyoko and another group of feminists took the time to translate the text \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" into Japanese. She is a different breed of career woman, who is both active in the world of women's rights, but also manages to run a private business on her own, though she attributes much of her success to the feminists who frequent her store. She keeps Japanese feminist texts perpetually in stock for their convenience. To her knowledge, Toyoko's store is the only \"women's\" book store in Japan. Instead of working up the corporate ladder, Toyoko managed to strike a chord with the women of Japan and succeed as an entrepreneur.\n\nRumiko Takahashi is among the wealthiest celebrity Japanese manga artists. She began creating manga in 1978, her greatest works finding their home in the \"Shōnen Sunday\" magazine, which remains one of the most popular distributors of manga in the country. Takahashi worked with clockwork regularity in getting her manga out, garnering numerous fans, several deals for overseas publications, and contracts for many of her most popular works to be made into anime, including \"Urusei Yatsura\", \"Ranma 1/2\", and \"Inuyasha\". She worked as hard as many career women, however, instead of choosing to embark in the difficult and often discriminatory corporate world, Takahashi chose a different kind of work and to this day remains one of the wealthiest women in Japan.\n\n"}

Veregin and Elsa Viktoria Norsten in 1929, not 1933, as was later misreported. Her family moved to Edmonton, Alberta in 1948, where she completed her education at Strathcona Composite High School.\n\nIn 1950, she met Ted Hole, a young University of Alberta agriculture student. Several years later they married and moved to a farm near St. Albert, Alberta. Lois and Ted Hole ran a successful market garden business from their farm which they, along with their sons Bill and Jim, incorporated as Hole's Greenhouses & Gardens Ltd. in 1979.\n\nIn 1993 Lois Hole wrote her first book, \"Vegetable Favourites\", and went on to write five more in the \"Favourites\" series. There are currently more than 1,000,000 copies of the various books in this series in print. The series won the Educational Media Award from the Professional Plant Growers Association in 1996. In 1998, Hole's Greenhouse began publishing their own books starting with Hole's autobiographical \"I'll Never Marry a Farmer\". She also wrote several books with her son, Jim. Hole's Greenhouse has continued to publish gardening books along with a successful annual magazine, \"Lois' Spring Gardening\".\n\nShe was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 1999 and a Dame of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in 2000. In 1995, she was named Edmonton Business and Professional Woman of the Year and St. Albert's Citizen of the Year. In 2003 she was awarded the Gandhi, King, Ikeda Humanitarian Award. She was made an \"Honorary Patricia\" by the 1st Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry.\n\nDuring his wife's term in office, Ted Hole died of cancer in April 2003. Lois Hole had been diagnosed with abdominal cancer in 2002, making a public announcement the following year when she began treatment in early 2003. Her health improved, temporarily, but by late 2004, her case was terminal. Her illness prevented her from making several scheduled public appearances. She died in office at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton on 6 January 2005, aged 75.\n\nMost sources cited 1933 as Lois Hole's year of birth based on her reported age at death. However, the Edmonton Journal, the Royal Alberta United Services Institute's newsletter and the Legislature of Alberta all indicate that she was born in 1929. The Office of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta confirmed that Hole was born on 30 January 1929.\n\nThe Alberta Library Trustees Association (ALTA) established the Lois Hole Award in 2001. In November 2004, two months before Lois Hole's death, the Capital Health Authority in Edmonton announced that a new wing of the Royal Alexandra Hospital would be named the Lois Hole Hospital for Women. It opened 13 April 2010 and consolidated the women's health programs and services based at the Royal Alexandra Hospital into one building.\n\nOn 19 April 2005 the Lois Hole Centennial Provincial Park was established, becoming the 69th provincial park in Alberta. The park contains the former Big Lake Natural Area and an additional 302 hectares of Crown land, for a total of 1421 hectares. The lake makes up around 59 per cent of the park's total area.\n\nIn 2008 the Edmonton Public Library opened the Lois Hole Library in Callingwood North. It features a sculpture of Lois Hole by Danek Mozdzenski and a reading garden. In 2009, the City of St. Albert declared 14 May to be Lois Hole Day. A bronze statue designed by Barbara Paterson called \"A Legacy of Love and Learning\" was unveiled at city hall on this day.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "77936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77936", "title": "Lughnasadh", "text": "Lughnasadh\n\nLughnasadh or Lughnasa ( ) is a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of the harvest season. Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. In Modern Irish it is called , in , and in . Traditionally it is held on 1 August, or about halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox. However, in recent centuries some of the celebrations shifted to the Sundays nearest this date. Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with Samhain, Imbolc and Beltane. It corresponds to other European harvest festivals such as the Welsh and the English Lammas.\n\nLughnasadh is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and has pagan origins. The festival itself is named after the god Lugh. It involved great gatherings that included religious ceremonies, ritual athletic contests (most notably the Tailteann Games), feasting, matchmaking and trading. There were also visits to holy wells. According to folklorist Máire MacNeill, evidence shows that the religious rites included an offering of the 'first fruits', a feast of the new food and of bilberries, the sacrifice of a bull and a ritual dance-play in which Lugh seizes the harvest for mankind and defeats the powers of blight. Much of the activities would have taken place on top of hills and mountains.\n\nLughnasadh customs persisted widely until the 20th century, with the event being variously named 'Garland Sunday', 'Bilberry Sunday', 'Mountain Sunday' and 'Crom Dubh Sunday'. The custom of climbing hills and mountains at Lughnasadh has survived in some areas, although it has been re-cast as a Christian pilgrimage. The best known is the 'Reek Sunday' pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick on the last Sunday in July. A number of fairs are also believed to be survivals of Lughnasadh, for example the Puck Fair. Since the late 20th century, Celtic neopagans have observed Lughnasadh, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. In some places, elements of the festival have been revived as a cultural event.\n\nIn Old Irish (or Old Gaelic), the name was ( ). This is a combination of (the god Lugh) and (an assembly), which is unstressed when used as a suffix. Later spellings include , and .\n\nIn Modern Irish (), the spelling is , which is also the name for the month of August. The genitive case is also as in (Month of August) and (Day of Lúnasa). In Modern Scottish Gaelic (), the festival and the month are both called . In Manx (), the festival and the month are both called . The day itself may be called either or .\n\nIn Welsh (), the day is known as , originally a Latin term, the \"Calends of August\" in English. In Breton (), the day was known as , the \"Feast of August\".\n\nIn Irish mythology, the Lughnasadh festival is said to have begun by the god Lugh (modern spelling: ) as a funeral feast and athletic competition (see funeral games) in commemoration of his mother or foster-mother Tailtiu. She was said to have died of exhaustion after clearing the plains of Ireland for agriculture. Tailtiu may have been an earth goddess who represented the dying vegetation that fed mankind. The funeral games in her honour were called the or (modern spelling: ) and were held each Lughnasadh at Tailtin in what is now County Meath. According to medieval writings, kings attended this \"óenach\" and a truce was declared for its duration. It was similar to the Ancient Olympic Games and included ritual athletic and sporting contests, horse racing, music and storytelling, trading, proclaiming laws and settling legal disputes, drawing-up contracts, and matchmaking. At Tailtin, trial marriages were conducted, whereby young couples joined hands through a hole in a wooden door. The trial marriage lasted a year and a day, at which time the marriage could be made permanent or broken without consequences. A similar Lughnasadh festival, the , was held in what is now County Kildare. Carman is also believed to have been a goddess, perhaps one with a similar tale as Tailtiu. The included a food market, a livestock market, and a market for foreign traders. After the 9th century the was celebrated irregularly and it gradually died out. It was revived for a period in the 20th century as the Tailteann Games.\n\nA 15th century version of the Irish legend \"Tochmarc Emire\" (\"the Wooing of Emer\") is one of the earliest documents to record these festivities.\n\nFrom the 18th century to the mid 20th century, many accounts of Lughnasadh customs and folklore were recorded. In 1962 \"The Festival of Lughnasa\", a study of Lughnasadh by folklorist Máire MacNeill, was published. MacNeill studied surviving Lughnasadh customs and folklore as well as the earlier accounts and medieval writings about the festival. She concluded that the evidence testified to the existence of an ancient festival around 1 August that involved the following:\n\nA solemn cutting of the first of the corn of which an offering would be made to the deity by bringing it up to a high place and burying it; a meal of the new food and of bilberries of which everyone must partake; a sacrifice of a sacred bull, a feast of its flesh, with some ceremony involving its hide, and its replacement by a young bull; a ritual dance-play perhaps telling of a struggle for a goddess and a ritual fight; an installation of a [carved stone] head on top of the hill and a triumphing over it by an actor impersonating Lugh; another play representing the confinement by Lugh of the monster blight or famine; a three-day celebration presided over by the brilliant young god [Lugh] or his human representative. Finally, a ceremony indicating that the interregnum was over, and the chief god in his right place again.\n\nAccording to MacNeill, the main theme that emerges from the folklore and rituals of Lughnasadh is a struggle for the harvest between two gods. One god – usually called Crom Dubh – guards the grain as his treasure. The other god – Lugh – must seize it for mankind. Sometimes, this was portrayed as a struggle over a woman called Eithne, who represents the grain. Lugh also fights and defeats a figure representing blight. MacNeill says that these themes can be seen in earlier Irish mythology, particularly in the tale of Lugh defeating Balor, which seems to represent the overcoming of blight, drought and the scorching summer sun. In surviving folklore, Lugh is usually replaced by Saint Patrick, while Crom Dubh is a pagan chief who owns a granary or a bull and who opposes Patrick, but is overcome and converted. Crom Dubh is likely the same figure as Crom Cruach and shares some traits with the Dagda and Donn. He may be based on an underworld god like Hades and Pluto, who kidnaps the grain goddess Persephone but is forced to let her return to the world above before harvest time.\n\nMany of the customs described by MacNeill and by medieval writers were being practised into the modern era, though they were either Christianized or shorn of any pagan religious meaning. Many of Ireland's prominent mountains and hills were climbed at Lughnasadh. Some of the treks were eventually re-cast as Christian pilgrimages, the most well-known being Reek Sunday—the yearly pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick in late July. Other hilltop gatherings were secular and attended mostly by the youth. In Ireland, bilberries were gathered and there was eating, drinking, dancing, folk music, games and matchmaking, as well as athletic and sporting contests such as weight-throwing, hurling and horse racing. At some gatherings, everyone wore flowers while climbing the hill and then buried them at the summit as a sign that summer was ending. In other places, the first sheaf of the harvest was buried. There were also faction fights, whereby two groups of young men fought with sticks. In 18th-century Lothian, rival groups of young men built towers of sods topped with a flag. For days, each group tried to sabotage the other's tower, and at Lughnasadh they met each other in 'battle'. Bull sacrifices around Lughnasadh time were recorded as late as the 18th century at Cois Fharraige in Ireland (where they were offered to Crom Dubh) and at Loch Maree in Scotland (where they were offered to Saint Máel Ruba). Special meals were made with the first produce of the harvest. In the Scottish Highlands, people made a special cake called the , which may have originated as an offering to the gods.\n\nAnother custom that Lughnasadh shared with Imbolc and Beltane was visiting holy wells. Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking sunwise around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or clooties (see clootie well). Although bonfires were lit at some of the open-air gatherings in Ireland, they were rare and incidental to the celebrations.\n\nTraditionally, Lughnasadh has always been reckoned as the first day of August. In recent centuries, however, much of the gatherings and festivities associated with it shifted to the nearest Sundays – either the last Sunday in July or first Sunday in August. It is believed this is because the coming of the harvest was a busy time and the weather could be unpredictable, which meant work days were too important to give up. As Sunday would have been a day of rest anyway, it made sense to hold celebrations then. The festival may also have been affected by the shift to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nIn Ireland, some of the mountain pilgrimages have survived. By far the most popular is the Reek Sunday pilgrimage at Croagh Patrick, which attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims each year. The Catholic Church in Ireland established the custom of blessing fields at Lughnasadh.\n\nThe Puck Fair is held each year in early August in the town of Killorglin, County Kerry. It has been traced as far back as the 16th century but is believed to be a survival of a Lughnasadh festival. At the beginning of the three-day festival, a wild goat is brought into the town and crowned 'king', while a local girl is crowned 'queen'. The festival includes traditional music and dancing, a parade, arts and crafts workshops, a horse and cattle fair, and a market. It draws a great number of tourists each year.\n\nIn recent years, other towns in Ireland have begun holding yearly Lughnasa Festivals and Lughnasa Fairs. Like the Puck Fair, these often include traditional music and dancing, arts and crafts workshops, traditional storytelling, and markets. Such festivals have been held in Gweedore, Sligo, Brandon, Rathangan and a number of other places. Craggaunowen, an open-air museum in County Clare, hosts a yearly Lughnasa Festival at which historical re-enactors demonstrate elements of daily life in Gaelic Ireland. It includes displays of replica clothing, artefacts, weapons and jewellery. A similar event has been held each year at Carrickfergus Castle in County Antrim. In 2011, RTÉ aired a live television program from Craggaunowen at Lughnasa, called \"Lughnasa Live\".\n\nIn the Irish diaspora, survivals of the Lughnasadh festivities are often seen by some families still choosing August as the traditional time for family reunions and parties, though due to modern work schedules these events have sometimes been moved to adjacent secular holidays, such as the Fourth of July in the United States.\n\nThe festival is referenced in Brian Friel's play \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" (1990), which was made into a film of the same name.\n\nLughnasadh and Lughnasadh-based festivals are held by some Neopagans, especially Celtic Neopagans. However, their Lughnasadh celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible, while others base their celebrations on many sources, the Gaelic festival being only one of them.\n\nNeopagans usually celebrate Lughnasadh on 1 August in the Northern Hemisphere and 1 February in the Southern Hemisphere, often beginning their festivities at sunset the evening before. Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the summer solstice and autumn equinox (or the full moon nearest this point). In 2017, this is on 7 August in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nCeltic Reconstructionists strive to reconstruct the pre-Christian religions of the Celts. Their religious practises are based on research and historical accounts, but may be modified slightly to suit modern life. They avoid syncretism (i.e. combining practises from different cultures).\n\nCeltic Reconstructionists who follow Gaelic traditions tend to celebrate Lughnasadh at the time of \"first fruits\", or on the full moon nearest this time. In the Northeastern United States, this is often the time of the blueberry harvest, while in the Pacific Northwest the blackberries are often the festival fruit. In Celtic Reconstructionism, Lughnasadh is seen as a time to give thanks to the spirits and deities for the beginning of the harvest season, and to propitiate them with offerings and prayers not to harm the still-ripening crops. The god Lugh is honoured by many at this time, and gentle rain on the day of the festival is seen as his presence and his bestowing of blessings. Many Celtic Reconstructionists also honour the goddess Tailtiu at Lughnasadh, and may seek to keep the \"Cailleachan\" from damaging the crops, much in the way appeals are made to Lugh.\n\nWiccans use the names \"Lughnasadh\" or \"Lammas\" for the first of their autumn harvest festivals. It is one of the eight yearly \"Sabbats\" of their Wheel of the Year, following Midsummer and preceding Mabon. It is seen as one of the two most auspicious times for handfasting, the other being at Beltane. Some Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the \"corn god\" in bread, and then symbolically sacrificing and eating it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58829", "title": "Market capitalization", "text": "Market capitalization\n\nMarket capitalization (market cap) is the market value of a publicly traded company's outstanding shares. Market capitalization is equal to the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. As outstanding stock is bought and sold in public markets, capitalization could be used as an indicator of public opinion of a company's net worth and is a determining factor in some forms of stock valuation.\n\nMarket capitalization is used by the investment community in ranking the size of companies, as opposed to sales or total asset figures. It is also used in ranking the relative size of stock exchanges, being a measure of the sum of the market capitalizations of all companies listed on each stock exchange. (See List of stock exchanges.) In performing such rankings, the market capitalizations are calculated at some significant date, such as June 30 or December 31.\n\nThe total capitalization of stock markets or economic regions may be compared with other economic indicators. The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world was US$51.2 trillion in January 2007 and rose as high as US$57.5 trillion in May 2008 before dropping below US$50 trillion in August 2008 and slightly above US$40 trillion in September 2008. In 2014 and 2015, global market capitalization was US$68 trillion and US$67 trillion, respectively.\n\nMarket cap is given by the formula formula_1, where \"MC\" is the market capitalization, \"N\" is the number of shares outstanding, and \"P\" is the closing price per share.\n\nFor example, if some company has 4 million shares outstanding and the closing price per share is $20, its market cap is then $80 million. If the closing price per share rises to $21, the market cap becomes $84 million. If it drops to $19 per share, the market cap falls to $76 million. This is in contrast to mercantile pricing where purchase price, average price and sale price may differ due to transaction costs.\n\nTraditionally, companies were divided into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. The terms mega-cap and micro-cap have also since come into common use, and nano-cap is sometimes heard. Different numbers are used by different indexes; there is no official definition of, or full consensus agreement about, the exact cutoff values. The cutoffs may be defined as percentiles rather than in nominal dollars. The definitions expressed in nominal dollars need to be adjusted over decades due to inflation, population change, and overall market valuation (for example, $1 billion was a large market cap in 1950, but it is not very large now), and market caps are likely to be different country to country.\n\nMarket cap reflects only the \"equity\" value of a company. It is important to note that a firm's choice of capital structure has a significant impact on how the total value of a company is allocated between equity and debt. A more comprehensive measure is enterprise value (EV), which gives effect to outstanding debt, preferred stock, and other factors. For insurance firms, a value called the embedded value (EV) has been used.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30139035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30139035", "title": "Nationalisms in Canada", "text": "Nationalisms in Canada\n\nThere has historically been, and continues to be, several rival nationalisms in Canada. Canadians have differing cultural and political identifications which often overlap. Loyalty towards Canada is tempered by strong regional and ethnic identities, and an affinity toward a common North American culture shared with the United States.\n\nThe largest and most-apparent differences are between English and French Canada, with the federal government recognizing the Québécois as \"a nation within a united Canada\". Among the provinces, Newfoundlanders also have a strong sense of national identity, having had a period of separate nationhood before joining the Canadian Confederation. Additionally, there has been a revival of Aboriginal nationalism, identifying with a specific band or tribe or with First Nations in general.\n\nAlso common are diaspora nationalisms, with nearly every such community represented in Canada. Most Canadians see no conflict in being loyal to Canada while retaining a sense of ethnic identity and connection to the homeland. With an increasingly diverse cultural landscape in the country, some have advocated for civic nationalism based on shared citizenship and common rights.\n\nThere has long been a recognition by scholars that English and French Canada have divergent views of the nation, often referred to as the Two Solitudes, from the title of a 1945 novel.\n\nThe existence of multiple strains of nationalism within nineteenth century English-speaking Canada was first explored by historian Carl Berger in his 1971 book \"The Sense of Power\" and his article in \"The Journal of British Studies\".\n\nIn the historiography of nationalism there is significant dispute over whether true nationalism existed in pre-modern societies. Canada's aboriginal peoples were generally organized into small societies which anthropologists call bands, which were sometimes part of a larger grouping called a tribe. Occasionally several tribes would form a larger group called a confederacy (the Iroquois, Seven Nations of Canada, Huron, Blackfoot, and Plains Cree-Assiniboine were or are confederacies). None of these resembled nations as understood in Europe in terms of scale or permanence. Today these groupings are referred to as \"First Nations\", representing their historical and modern role as sources of identity for many native people.\n\nThe first Europeans to exhibit nationalism in Canada may have been the French settlers who inhabited New France. They showed a great deal of loyalty and community in the face of repeated attacks by British and Iroquois rivals during the French and Indian Wars. However, by the end of the French regime in North America, \"acadiens\" and \"canadiens\" may have already been showing signs of developing identities distinct from France.\n\nThe interrelated British ideologies of nationalism, unionism, loyalism, and imperialism arrived first in Newfoundland then the Maritimes, and finally in Central Canada with British traders who followed the British Army into these regions as each was successively won from France, ending with the Treaty of Paris (1763). They were reinforced from the 1770s to 1810s by the United Empire Loyalists: pro-British refugees fleeing the American Revolution.\n\nReactions to British and American encroachments produced movements for solidarity between native tribes across much of eastern North America during Pontiac's Rebellion of 1759 and Tecumseh's Rebellion of 1811. By the end of the War of 1812, however, natives had lost their national sovereignty across most of Eastern Canada.\n\nThe influx of British settlers into Canada helped to prompt the development of French-Canadian nationalism which was quite evident during the 1837 rebellion against British rule in Lower Canada. At the same time a few English-speakers in Upper Canada were switching from a British to a Canadian form of identity, as evidenced in the contemporaneous Upper Canada Rebellion, although this was a minority position.\n\nNot long afterwards, many English-speakers in Canada became attracted to American nationalism, in the form of annexationism, highlighted by the Montreal Annexation Manifesto of 1850.\n\nIrish nationalism in its strong form of physical force Irish republicanism was evident in Canada during the Fenian Raids of the 1860s and assassination of Thomas D'Arcy McGee in 1868.\n\nWhen the Canadian Confederation was established in 1867, British and Canadian forms of identity and political allegiance continued to coexist. In 1891 election, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, himself a Scotsman, wrapped himself in the Union Jack, swore to keep Canada British, and called proposals for freer trade with the United States \"veiled treason\".\n\nIn Western Canada, native tribes retained their autonomy from Canadian society far longer than in the east. The interaction of European and Canadian traders with Indians in the interior led to the creation of an entirely new nation, the Métis. Along with Indian allies, the Métis asserted their national rights during the two Riel Rebellions (1870 and 1885).\n\nThe project of Imperial Federation (creating a federal government for the entire British Empire), had important advocates in English Canada (the \"imperialists\") around the turn of the 20th century, but it ultimately floundered due opposition from (\"anti-imperialist\" or \"nationalist\") French-Canadian leaders such as Henri Bourassa and Wilfrid Laurier, and to indifference in Britain.\n\n\"British feeling\" in Canada was in decline following the Alaska boundary dispute in 1903, in which Britain sided with the United States' border claims over Canada's. Imperialists in Canada tried to correct this with the creation of the Empire Club of Canada that same year.\n\nNewfoundland had persistently resisted offer to join the Canadian Confederation since 1867, and so was elevated to the status of a dominion in 1907, co-equal to Canada within the British Empire. This further solidified Newfoundlander identity and added a period of separate nationhood to the later mythos of Newfoundland.\n\nBy the 1910 Canadian federal election – which again centred on trade with the United States and also the creation of a Canadian Navy separate from the British Royal Navy – Prime Minister Laurier complained that in Quebec he was called an imperialist, in Ontario a separatist, but, he protested, he was simply a Canadian.\n\nCanadian participation in the World Wars was both divisive and unifying in different ways. French Canadians resisted the implementation of conscription during the crises of 1917 and 1944, leading to an erosion of francophone identification with the Canadian federation. In contrast English Canadians, especially recent immigrants from England, rallied to join the military in large numbers out of a sense of British loyalism. They saw their experience of the war, fighting in the Canadian Corps, as \"the birth of a nation\", when Canada replaced Britain as their primary focus of loyalty.\n\nCanadian ties with Britain were loosened when Canada became fully legislatively independent of the United Kingdom by the Balfour Declaration of 1926, created its own citizenship law in 1946, and its own flag in 1965. Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, though Newfoundlander identity did not disappear.\n\nIn Quebec traditional religion- and culture-focused French-Canadian nationalism was being replaced with a new state-centred Quebecois nationalism during the Quiet Revolution, leading many to adopt the goal of Quebec's secession from the Canadian confederation. This has for the most part been a peaceful movement, aside from a string of terrorist attacks by the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) in 1969 and 1970, leading to a government crackdown in 1970.\n\nSince the 1970s, there have also been movements that have sought to turn the habitual feelings of Western alienation into a movement for Western separatism or Alberta separatism, although these movements often overlap with annexationist movements.\n\nAlso since the 1960s and 1970s there has been a revival of Aboriginal nationalism in Canada. This can take the form of identification with a specific band or tribe or with First Nations in general. Cree and Inuit nationalism in northern Quebec (which is generally mutually exclusive with Quebecois nationalism) lead to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement (1975) which was concerned with native title over northern Quebec's crown lands. However the potential fate of northern Quebec if Quebec were to secede from Canada remains a point of controversy. Inuit activism (perhaps nationalism) has led to the creation of the federal territory of Nunavut (1994) and intra-provincial territories of Nunavik (in Quebec), Nunatsiavut (in Newfoundland and Labrador), and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (in the Northwest Territories and Yukon).\n\nDiaspora nationalisms are quite common in Canada, with nearly every diaspora community in the world represented. Prior to the liberalization of Canadian immigration laws in the 1960s, the largest diaspora populations were groups with European or Near Eastern origins like Ukrainian, Irish, Azerbaijani or Armenian nationalists, and Zionists (people who support the existence of Israel). These have since been joined by groups from other continents, especially Asia, such as Punjabi Sikhs, Sri Lankan Tamils, etc.\n\nAccording to the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, Canada should be seen as a multinational country. All Canadians are members of Canada as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, and this is a community that contains many other kinds within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, and civic (the provincial and municipal governments) sorts, but also national communities, which often include or overlap with many of the other kinds. He thus recognizes the following nations within Canada: those formed by the various aboriginal First Nations, that of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47626304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47626304", "title": "Penumbra (law)", "text": "Penumbra (law)\n\nIn United States constitutional law, the penumbra includes a group of rights derived, by implication, from other rights explicitly protected in the Bill of Rights. These rights have been identified through a process of \"reasoning-by-interpolation\", where specific principles are recognized from \"general idea[s]\" that are explicitly expressed in other constitutional provisions. Although researchers have traced the origin of the term to the nineteenth century, the term first gained significant popular attention in 1965, when Justice William O. Douglas's majority opinion in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" identified a right to privacy in the penumbra of the constitution.\n\nCommentators disagree about the precise origin of the use of the term \"penumbra\" in American legal scholarship, but most believe it was first used in the late nineteenth century. Burr Henly, for example, traces the first use of the word to an 1873 law review article written by Oliver Wendell Holmes, in which he argued that it is better for new law to grow \"in the penumbra between darkness and light, than to remain in uncertainty\". Luis Sirico and Henry T. Greely, on the other hand, trace the term to Justice Stephen Johnson Field's 1871 circuit court opinion in \"Montgomery v. Bevans\", where Justice Field used the term to describe a period of time in which it was uncertain whether an individual could legally be considered deceased. Other commentators, including Glenn H. Reynolds and Brannon P. Denning, note that elements of penumbral reasoning can be found in much older cases that precede the first use of the term \"penumbra\"; they trace the origins of penumbral reasoning to United States Supreme Court cases from the early nineteenth century. For example, Reynolds and Denning describe Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" as \"the quintessential example of penumbral reasoning\".\n\nAlthough the meaning of the term has varied over time, scholars now generally agree that the term refers to a group of rights that are not explicitly stated in the constitution, but can be inferred from other enumerated rights. The definition of the term was originally derived from its primary scientific meaning, which is \"a space of partial illumination (as in an eclipse) between the perfect shadow on all sides and the full light\". By analogy, rights that exist in the constitution's penumbra can be found in the \"shadows\" of other portions constitution. Additionally, the process of identifying rights in constitutional penumbras is known as \"penumbral reasoning\". Brannon P. Denning and Glenn H. Reynolds have described this interpretive framework as the process of \"drawing logical inferences by looking at relevant parts of the Constitution as a whole and their relationship to one another.\" Glenn H. Reynolds has also characterized penumbral reasoning as a process of \"reasoning-by-interpolation\" where judges identify the full scope and extent of constitutional rights.\n\nThe term \"penumbra\" first appeared in an opinion published by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1916, and the term appeared ten more times in published opinions between 1916 and 1941. Between 1941 and the date of publication of \"Griswold v. Connecticut\", the term was used eight times by Justice William O. Douglas and four times by other Justices. Second Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Learned Hand also used the term eleven times between 1915 and 1950, usually to place emphasis on words or concepts that were ambiguous. For example, in \"Commissioner v. Ickelheimer\", Judge Hand wrote, \"[t]he colloquial words of a statute have not the fixed and artificial content of scientific symbols; they have a penumbra, a dim fringe, a connotation, for they express an attitude of will, into which it is our duty to penetrate and which we must enforce ungrudgingly when we can ascertain it, regardless of imprecision in its expression\".\n\nBefore \"Griswold\", different Supreme Court Justices would often utilize different definitions of the term in different contexts, possibly because the Justices did not understand the meaning of the word. In \"Schlesinger v. Wisconsin\", for example, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes used the term to describe rights derived by implication. He wrote, \"the law allows a penumbra to be embraced that goes beyond the outline of its object in order that the object may be secured\". Likewise, in \"Olmstead v. United States\", Justice Holmes argued that evidence obtained through wire-tapping should not be admitted at trial, and that \"the penumbra of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments covers the defendant\". However, in \"A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States\", Justice Benjamin Cardozo used the term to describe an area of uncertainty in the law. He wrote, \"[t]here is no penumbra of uncertainty obscuring judgment here. To find immediacy or directness here is to find it almost everywhere\". Additionally, in \"Coleman v. Miller\", Justice Felix Frankfurter used the term in a manner that was more closely related to its traditional definition. When arguing that a group of legislators lacked standing, he wrote, \"[n]o doubt the bounds of such legal interest have a penumbra which gives some freedom in judging fulfillment of our jurisdictional requirements\".\n\nJ. Christopher Rideout and Burr Henly note that the term achieved prominence after Justice Douglas' majority opinion in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" held that a right to privacy existed in the penumbra of the constitution. In \"Griswold\", the Supreme Court ultimately held that a Connecticut law that criminalized the use of contraception was unconstitutional. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice Douglas held that the Connecticut law violated a fundamental right to privacy. After reviewing a line of cases in which the Supreme Court identified rights not explicitly enumerated in the constitution, Justice Douglas declared that \"[t]he foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance\". Justice Douglas argued that the Court could infer a right to privacy by looking at \"zones of privacy\" protected by First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments:\n\nConsequently, Justice Douglas argued that the constitution included \"penumbral rights of privacy and repose.\" Justice Douglas also remarked that without \"peripheral rights,\" the \"specific rights\" enumerated in the constitution would be \"less secure\". According to Burr Henly, Justice Douglas' majority opinion did not use the term to identify the articulable boundaries of language and the law, as Justice Holmes had done, but rather to connect the text of the constitution to unenumerated rights.\n\nHelen Hershkoff has described penumbral reasoning as \"an important feature of American constitutional practice in cases involving individual rights and government power\", and J. Christopher Rideout notes that many scholars have defended the \"conceptual integrity\" of penumbral reasoning. Likewise, Burr Henly has described the penumbra as \"the most important\" metaphor in American constitutional jurisprudence. Other scholars, including Judge A. Raymond Randolph of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and historian David J. Garrow, also note that Justice Douglas' identification of the right to privacy in \"Griswold\" ultimately served as a doctrinal stepping-stone to \"Roe v. Wade\", where the United States Supreme Court ruled that the right to privacy protects the right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nGlenn H. Reynolds has also observed that courts routinely engage in penumbral reasoning, regardless of their location on the political spectrum. However, Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski and UCLA School of Law professor Eugene Volokh note that the use of penumbral reasoning by courts \"cuts both ways\" because it can be used to both expand individual liberties and to expand the powers of the government at the expense of individual liberty. Richard E. Levy also argued that penumbral reasoning, fundamental rights analyses, and political-process theory can justify judicial intervention on behalf of individual liberty as well as judicial intervention to advance economic interests.\n\nDespite the \"pivotal\" role that penumbral reasoning has played in American constitutional jurisprudence, the Supreme Court's use of penumbral reasoning has also generated controversy. District of Columbia Circuit Judge Robert Bork, for example, was a particularly vocal critic of Supreme Court rulings that identified rights that are not explicitly enumerated in the text of the constitution. Likewise, in his dissenting opinion in \"Griswold\", Justice Hugo Black stated his concerns with finding a right to privacy in the penumbra of the constitution and that he disagreed with the majority's attempts to \"stretch\" the Bill of Rights. Additionally, Louis J. Sirico Jr. has described the term as \"intellectually confusing\", and William J. Watkins, Jr. wrote that the penumbra of the constitution is \"a seemingly strange place to discover constitutional guarantees\". Robert J. Pushaw Jr. also described penumbral reasoning as a \"transparently fictional\" process, and Jennifer Fahnestock has cautioned that \"implicit constitutional rights\" are vulnerable to being lost \"due to their lack of permanency\".\n\n"}

When filling out the birth registration, Ernst had indicated the father was \"unacknowledged by the mother\" and that they were not together at the time. Consequently, she put \"Ernst\" as their surnames. However, Trociuk claimed they had agreed on registering the children's surnames as \"Ernst-Trociuk\" and tried to get the records changed to include his particulars.\n\nSection 3(1)(b) and 4(1)(a) of the \"Vital Statistics Act\" prevented a father from amending registrations. Trociuk applied for a declaration to have the provision struck out as unconstitutional for violating his section 15 right to equality.\n\nThe Director of Vital Statistics denied the changing of the children's surnames to include their biological father's name. Trociuk then took his case to the British Columbia Supreme Court, where it was upheld.\n\nDeschamps J, writing for a Supreme Court, allowed the appeal in favour of Trociuk. It was found that section 3 of the Act violated section 15(1) of the \"Charter\" by allowing differential treatment based on sex. The provision had the effect of excluding the father's particulars from birth registration, excluding him from choosing his child's surname, and precluding any recourse. These effects were found to be arbitrary and created significant impact on the perception of the father's dignity, and consequently violated section 15(1).\n\nOn the section 1 analysis, Deschamps J held the violation could not be saved because the law did not impair Trociuk's rights as little as reasonably possible.\n\n\n"}
