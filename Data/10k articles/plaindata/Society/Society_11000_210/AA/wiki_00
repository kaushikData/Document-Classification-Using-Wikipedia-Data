Cline and published in 2014 by Princeton University Press. The book focuses on his hypothesis for the Late Bronze Age collapse of civilization, a transition period that affected the Egyptians, Hittites, Canaanites, Cypriots, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Assyrians and Babylonians; varied heterogeneous cultures populating eight powerful and flourishing states intermingling via trade, commerce, exchange and \"cultural piggybacking\", despite \"all the difficulties of travel and time\". He presents evidence to support a \"perfect storm\" of \"multiple interconnected failures\", meaning that more than one natural and man-made cataclysm caused the disintegration and demise of an ancient civilization that incorporated \"empires and globalized peoples\". This ended the Bronze Age, and ended the Mycenaean, Minoan, Trojan, Hittite, and Babylonian cultures. Before this book, the leading hypothesis during previous decades attributed the civilization collapse mostly to Sea Peoples of unknown origin.\n\nThis book has won the following awards:\n\n\n\n"}

Only Neptune features in the plot, and his power is never destroyed. The scene was intended to symbolize the people's release into freedom without gods or idols.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the German press agency DPA said Berlin police have so far recorded no direct threat to the opera house. However, \"The New York Times\" reported that there was an anonymous threat in August against the theatre.\n\nThe cancellation sparked a great deal of debate in Europe on the issue of self-censorship and the nature of free speech in a multicultural community that includes potentially violent Muslims. On September 27, 2006, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel stated: \"I think the cancellation was a mistake. I think self-censorship does not help us against people who want to practise violence in the name of Islam ... It makes no sense to retreat.\" Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, after a government-sponsored conference with Muslim representatives held independently of the incident, told reporters that \"[t]o send a signal, we could all go to the performance together,\" and the Muslim representatives agreed that the performance should not be cancelled.\n\nOn December 18, 2006, the Berlin Opera staged Mozart's work with the newly added controversial ending scene amid mixed reactions, but no incidents (with a small security force and large foreign media contingent). Demonstrators were present outside, as well, including supporters of religious tolerance and Christian protesters (presumably relating to the inclusion of the severed head of Jesus). Various members of German government attended with German Muslim groups, with the notable exception of the central Muslim Council's general secretary, Iman Mazyek, who was quoted by Al Jazeera English as saying, \"It's part of the concept of freedom of opinion and thought that you also have the right to say you are not going.\".\n\n, director of the Deutsche Opera, said that the public's reaction to the scene was \"very civilized\".\n"}

Running from 1924-1931, it was founded by Bert Temple, an ex-soldier and silk-merchant, initially to raise £100 (equal to £ today) for the children's charities of the surgeon Sir Alfred Fripp. One of the Order's first meeting places was the Swan, Fittleworth, W. Sussex - the 'No. 0 Vat'.\n\nTemple founded the organisation in gratitude for life-saving stomach surgery by Fripp. Membership of this spoof order cost 5 shillings (equal to £ today), each member receiving a pair of silver, enamelled cuff-links and a membership booklet and card entitling them to blow froth off any member's beer \"and occasionally off non-members' beer provided they are not looking or are of a peaceful disposition\". The motto was \"Lubrication in Moderation\".\n\nThe idea was to meet regularly in pubs or clubs (\"Vats\") to enjoy \"beer, beef and baccy\", possibly a memory of the Skeleton_Army of the 1880s, and there to be fined for heinous sins, such as not wearing the cuff-links (dinners opened with the highest-ranking member, the \"Senior Blower\", giving the command \"Gentlemen, shoot your linen\" at which point all members showed their cuffs). All fines and residual membership fees to be sent to Sir Alfred and Lady Fripp for their \"Wee Waifs\" of the East End of London.\n\nIn late 1925, the editor of \"The Sporting Times\" started to publish articles on the Order's gatherings, and the idea took hold of the public imagination. The now-retired Fripp travelled around the country as guest speaker at over 200 of these Vats, and thousands clamoured to join: men (\"Blowers\"), women (\"Fairy Belles\"), their children and their dogs (\"Faithful Bow-Wows\") were all enrolled. Those who enrolled others received titles such as Blaster (25 members recruited), Tornado (100), up to Grand Typhoon (1000).\n\nFor five years the Froth Blowers extolled Britishness and \"Lubrication in Moderation\". Their song \"The More We Are Together\", an adaptation of \"Oh du lieber Augustin\" specially written by the pseudonymous Irving King, was heard everywhere.\n\nThe more we are together, together, together<br>\nThe more we are together<br>\nThe merrier we'll be.<br>\nFor your friends are my friends<br>\nAnd my friends are your friends,<br>\nAnd the more we are together<br>\nThe merrier we'll be.\nBy late 1928, 700,000 had joined, raising over £100,000 (equal to £ today) for hospital cots, outings to the country, invalid children, etc. It endowed 40 hospital cots, funded holidays for thousands of needy children, and in 1929 established a roof garden for mothers and children on the Marylebone Housing Association's first block of slum clearance flats.\n\nA plaque designed by artist and illustrator Henry Charles Innes Fripp, cousin of Arthur Fripp, was created to accompany donations of £500 (about £20,000 in today's money) to fund the costs of 50 children's hospital beds.\n\nTheir popularity was particularly upsetting to the Temperance activists who believed that it was alcohol which caused the \"wee waifs'\" suffering; not something a doctor and surgeon-to-the-King should be sponsoring. In 1927, Walter Greville of the Good Templars described it as \"the latest recruited ally of the liquor trade\", saying that \"for ridiculous vulgarity and foolish methods it took the first prize\". Sir George Hunter, speaking for the Fellowship of Freedom and Reform in 1929, called the Froth Blowers \"a disgrace to the country\".\n\nNevertheless, the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Hailsham, described it as \"a great charitable organisation\", and when Fripp died in 1930 his \"Times\" obituary said of the Froth Blowers, \"These, by their innocent mirth, assisted by a catchy tune, have contributed largely to charities, and have entertained and brightened the lives of innumerable children\".\n\nThe movement came to a natural end shortly after Fripp's death, when \"The Sporting Times\" folded and finally Bert Temple died in 1931. In that year the Ancient Order of Froth Blowers Limited went into voluntary liquidation. Residual money was used by Lady Fripp and her family to fund \"Heartsease\", a Girl Guide retreat in the grounds of the West Wickham Home of Recovery for Children with Heart Disease, a hospital which had been partially funded by Froth Blower gifts in 1927. The Ancient Order of Froth Blowers Girl Guide and Boy Scout Charity Limited still administers this site.\n\n\"A sociable and law-abiding fraternity of absorptive Britons who sedately consume and quietly enjoy with commendable regularity and frequention the truly British malted beverage as did their forbears and as Britons ever will, and be damned to all pussyfoot hornswogglers from overseas and including low brows, teetotalers and MPs and not excluding nosey parkers, mock religious busy bodies and suburban fool hens all of which are structurally solid bone from the chin up\".\n\nJohn Betjeman's poem \"The Varsity Students' Rag\" contains the line \"I started a rag in Putney at our Froth-Blowers' branch down there\".\n\nIn Dorothy Sayers's story \"The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba\", Lord Peter Wimsey describes his safe as \"the ordinary strong-room, where I keep my cash and Froth Blower's cuff-links and all that.\" In her novel \"Unnatural Death\", Lord Peter assures a nurse that \"I haven't come to sell you soap or gramophones, or to borrow money or enrol you in the Ancient Froth-blowers or anything charitable\".\n\nThe mercenary group led by Mike Hoare in an attempted 1981 coup of the Seychelles disguised itself as a drinking party calling itself The Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers.\n\nIn \"The Female of the Species\" by Sapper, the anthem is used as a means of identification by Bulldog Drummond and his chums.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29189079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29189079", "title": "Antemoro people", "text": "Antemoro people\n\nThe Antemoro (or Antaimoro) are an ethnic group of Madagascar living on the southeastern coast, mostly between Manakara and Farafangana. Numbering around 500,000, this ethnic group traces its origins back to Arab settlers who arrived from Mecca in the 15th or 16th century. Upon settling in Madagascar, these Arabs converted the Antemoro to Islam; the religion was soon abandoned in favor of traditional beliefs and practices associated with respect for the ancestors, although remnants of Islam remain in \"fady\" such as the prohibition against consuming pork. In the 16th century an Antemoro kingdom was established, supplanting the power of the earlier Zafiraminia, who also descended from Arab seafarers. \n\nThe Antemoro soon developed a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers, in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing, termed \"sorabe\", which uses the Arabic script to transcribe the Malagasy language. Antemoro \"ombiasy\" (astrologer sages) migrated throughout the island, where they practiced their arts for local communities, served as advisers to kings, and even founded new principalities. This Antemoro mobility and their creation of a network of powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among Malagasy of communities beyond their own and sparking a sense of a common Malagasy identity. The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class.\n\nToday the Antemoro remain clustered around the southeast coastal homeland, where they grow rice and coffee, produce salt, and manufacture charms. The Antemoro often leave their homeland for six to ten months out of the year or more to work as ombiasy offering charms, spells, divinations and other arcane services. Nearly every village in Madagascar has an ombiasy, and many are either Antemoro themselves or have traveled to the Antemoro homeland to receive training. The community's historic production of Antemoro paper, a flower-embedded paper traditionally used to record secret knowledge using sorabe, is another major source of income as the paper is commonly sold to tourists and exported overseas.\n\n\"Antemoro\", in the Malagasy language, means \"people of the coast\". They live on the southeastern coast, mostly between Manakara and Farafangana. The Antemoro are descendants of Muslims who settled in Madagascar in the 14th century and intermarried with the local population. In 2013 the Antemoro population was estimated at 500,000. While there are claims that link them to Arabia, other scholars argue these people are more likely linked to groups originating in the Swahili coast.\n\nThe Antemoro figure among the more recent settlers on the island of Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (\"sombili\"), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.\nAround 1550 the mounting conflict seems to have reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader's marriage to a local woman. Historical texts tie the lineage of the family's leader, Zafikazimambobe, to Anteony noble Ramarohala, who had settled there at least three generations before. Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual, and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles. Rather, these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means, and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro of the importance of local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them. Upon rising to power, the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier \"ombiasy\" (wise men) who practiced astrology and served as scribes; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed. These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct \"sombily\" (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom. They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island.\n\nUnder Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' freedom was significantly reduced and religion became a central feature of social and political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms. In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina, Tanala and Antanosy may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country.\n\nBy the early 18th century, the Antemoro had established themselves as major rice and slave exporters. Throughout the 1700s, the Antemoro were embroiled in a conflict with the Ikongo-Tanala that culminated in a bloody Tanala invasion of the eastern coastal plain. Shortly afterward, a major Antemoro leader named Andriamamohotra established an alliance and vassal relationship with the king then ruling Imerina, Andrianampoinimerina, to reestablish peace.\n\nAntemoro villages are primarily clustered in the southeastern coastal area near Vohipeno and Manakara. Society was traditionally divided into two broad categories: the \"mpanombily\" (or \"tompomenakely\"), who were nobles said to be descended from Arabs from Mecca, and the \"menakely\", composed of the working and slave classes, who were said to have descended from the local Malagasy who submitted to the Arabs' rule, or alternately from slaves that the Arabs had brought with them. The mpanombily comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara, Onjatsy, Tsimaito, Antaiony, Antalaotra, Antaisambo, Antaimahazo and others. Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities. The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans.\n\nAntemoro kings (\"andrianony\") were selected by popular decision from among the Anakara clan, originally clustered around the mouth of the Matitanana river near the town of Manakara that shares their name. Once selected, these rulers were accorded a near-sacred status. The \"fady\" they established were scrupulously observed for centuries after the ruler's death. The Anakara were responsible for safeguarding the sacred Antemoro idols and texts, spoke a secret language for communicating arcane knowledge amongst themselves, and rarely intermarried with other Antemoro clans. This clan was believed to be in communication with powerful genies (\"ziny\") and other spirits and was reputed to produce the most powerful sorcerers and astrologers on the island. They knew how to manufacture charms, cast spells, and practice geomancy using local gemstones. To maintain their distinction from other members of Antemoro society, the Anakara lived in villages sealed off by spiked wooden palisades where none could enter without permission. Rulers were further distinguished by \"fady\" forbidding them to wear shirts or hats.\n\nEach Antemoro clan was endogamous and marriage outside the clan was deeply taboo. Those who transgressed were mourned as if dead and were entirely cut off from the community.\n\nThe Antemoro adhere to the traditional spiritual beliefs and practices common throughout the island, although different Antemoro clans and families incorporate aspects of Islam to varying degrees. They commonly make and wear amulets upon which verses of the Qur'an are written using the \"sorabe\" script. Before converting to Islam in the seventh or eighth century, the Malagasy clans that later intermarried with Arabs to found the Antemoro dynasty were monotheists who believed in a creator god and numerous spirits that served as intermediaries between living beings and the creator. By the time of conversion to Islam, the creator god had been all but forgotten, with much greater focus placed on the spirits, who had been raised to the level of deities. The arrival of Arab settlers prompted large scale conversion to Islam, but the core tenets were soon lost and gave way to the honoring of ancestors and their \"fady\".\n\nArab and Islamic influences strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing included a turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes similar to those worn in many other parts of the Muslim world. \"Harefo\" reeds were woven to form mats (\"tafitsihy\") that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of \"fanto\" (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.\n\nThe Antemoro were reputed across the island for being the only ethnic group to have developed a written form of the Malagasy language, sorabe, which used Arabic script; this form of writing was largely replaced elsewhere by the Latin alphabet under the Merina monarchy in the 19th century. The Antemoro were also widely reputed in the pre-colonial period for their astrologers, who would predict the future based on lunar phases. They were known all across Madagascar and acted as advisers at the court of many Malagasy kings, including the celebrated Merina king Andrianampoinimerina, whose Antemoro astrologers advised him and taught him sorabe writing. The pan-Madagascar tradition of the ombiasy is rooted in this element of Antemoro culture. The introduction of royal \"sampy\" (idols) into the Kingdom of Imerina is likewise attributed to an Antemoro ombiasy.\n\nTaboos (\"fady\") among the Antemoro derive from ancestral traditions as well as from aspects of Islamic and Arab culture. An Antemoro taboo against dogs as unclean, although shared by Islam, actually predates the arrival of the religion on the island. The prohibition against eating pork, however, originated with the introduction of Islam. Traditionally, members of a given Antemoro clan could only eat with others of the same clan.\n\nThe death of any member of the community is mourned in the same way, regardless of social class. All community members participate in a week-long period of mourning for the deceased, during which time they are forbidden to wash or change clothing. On the eighth day, the mourning period is broken and everyone bathes and dresses in fresh attire. A female widow must continue the mourning period until the parents of the deceased declare it completed. A male widower remains shut away in his home for a period of one or two weeks, during which time the parents of the deceased send a female family member to care for him and keep him company.\nThe Antemoro speak a dialect of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. The language is traditionally written using the sorabe script, and those who master this form of writing are called \"katibo\" and are considered to possess unusual power. Sorabe writings traditionally ranged from instructional texts for teaching astrology, to historical records and other forms of documentation, and materials written using the sorabe script were considered to be sacred.\n\nMany Antemoro work as ombiasy and earn their livelihood selling their services as astrologers, sorcerers, or crafters of powerful amulets; it is common for men to travel for six to ten months out of the year. Coffee production is widespread in the Antemoro homeland and generates income for many families. Those who own little or no land often emigrate to work as agricultural laborers in the north and west. The Antemoro Ampanira clan was historically a main producer and trader of sea salt. The Antemoro are well known for their handmade paper, which is often decorated using pressed fresh flowers and leaves. Antemoro paper is a major product marketed to tourists.\n\nThe first formal school in the Kingdom of Imerina was established and run from 1800 to 1804 by two Antemoro ombiasy, Andriamahazonoro and Ratsilikaina, who taught the future King Radama I and four or five other children to read using sorabe, trained them to manufacture ink and paper, and educated them in the art of astrology and divination. Andriamahazonoro was among the party of three who served as the first ambassadors to Britain and Mauritius; he died in 1838 from \"tangena\" poison administered in a trial by ordeal during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I.\n\n"}

{"id": "14517800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14517800", "title": "Anti-nuclear movement in Australia", "text": "Anti-nuclear movement in Australia\n\nNuclear weapons testing, uranium mining and export, and nuclear power have often been the subject of public debate in Australia, and the anti-nuclear movement in Australia has a long history. Its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.\n\nSeveral groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established in the mid-1970s, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE), cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The movement suffered a setback in 1983 when the newly elected Labor Government failed to implement its stated policy of stopping uranium mining. But by the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case; CANE was disbanded in 1988.\n\nAbout 2003, proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to global warming and the Australian government began taking an interest. Anti-nuclear campaigners and some scientists in Australia argued that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs of 2015, Australia has no nuclear power stations and five uranium mines, four of which are located in South Australia. Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) is a large underground mine, Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon are in-situ leach mines and Ranger in an open pit mine in the Northern Territory. Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export. Australia has no nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered vessels.\n\nIn 1952 the Australian Government established the Rum Jungle Uranium Mine 85 kilometres south of Darwin. Local aboriginal communities were not consulted and the mine site became an environmental disaster.\n\nAlso in 1952, the Liberal Government passed legislation, the \"Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952\", which allowed the British Government access to remote parts of Australia to undertake atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. The general public were largely unaware of the risks from the testing program, stemming from official secrecy about the testing program and the remote locations of the test sites. But as the \"Ban the Bomb\" movement gathered momentum in Western societies throughout the 1950s, so too did opposition to the British tests in Australia. An opinion poll taken in 1957 showed 49 per cent of the Australian public were opposed to the tests and only 39 per cent in favour.\n\nIn 1963, Australia was one of the first signatories to a Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In 1964, Peace Marches which featured \"Ban the bomb\" placards, were held in several Australian capital cities.\n\nIn 1969, a 500 MW nuclear power plant was proposed for the Jervis Bay Territory, 200 km south of Sydney. A local opposition campaign began, and the South Coast Trades and Labour Council (covering workers in the region) announced that it would refuse to build the reactor. Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated, but in 1971 the Australian government decided not to proceed with the project, citing economic reasons.\n\nThe 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific mobilised several groups, including some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns saw it as a champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nIn 1974 and 1975 concern came to focus on uranium mining in Australia and several Friends of the Earth groups were formed. The Australian Conservation Foundation also began voicing concern about uranium mining and supporting the activities of the grass-roots organisations. Concern about the environmental effects of uranium mining was a significant factor and poor management of waste at an early uranium mine, Rum Jungle, led it to become a significant pollution problem in the 1970s. The Australian anti-nuclear movement also acquired initial impetus from notable individuals who publicly voiced nuclear concerns, such as nuclear scientists Richard Temple and Rob Robotham, and poets Dorothy Green and Judith Wright.\n\nIn 1975, Moss Cass, Minister for the Environment and Conservation, led parliamentarians and ALP branch members in expressing concerns about the effects of uranium mining. A key concern was the adverse effect that uranium mining would have on the northern Aboriginal people. Cass said: \"nuclear energy creates the most dangerous, insidious and persistent waste products, ever experienced on the planet\".\n\nThe years 1976 and 1977 saw uranium mining become a major political issue, with the Ranger Inquiry (Fox) report opening up a public debate about uranium mining. Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining (founded in 1976) and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (formed in South Australia in 1976), cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth (which came to Australia in 1975) and the Australian Conservation Foundation (formed in 1975).\n\nIn November and December 1976, 7,000 people marched through the streets of Australian cities, protesting against uranium mining. The Uranium Moratorium group was formed and it called for a five-year moratorium on uranium mining. In April 1977 the first national demonstration co-ordinated by the Uranium Moratorium brought around 15,000 demonstrators into the streets of Melbourne, 5,000 in Sydney, and smaller numbers elsewhere. A National signature campaign attracted over 250,000 signatures calling for a five-year moratorium. In August, another demonstration brought 50,000 people out nationally and the opposition to uranium mining looked like a potential political force.\n\nIn 1977, the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) passed a motion in favour of an indefinite moratorium on uranium mining, and the anti-nuclear movement acted to support the Labor Party and help it regain office. However, a setback for the movement occurred in 1982 when another ALP conference overturned its anti-uranium policy in favour of a \"one mine policy\". After the ALP won power in 1983, its 1984 National Conference voted in favour of a \"Three mine policy\". This referred to the then three existing uranium mines in Australia, Nabarlek, Ranger and Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam, and articulated ALP support for pre-existing mines and contracts, but opposition to any new mining.\n\nIn 1977-78, the West Australian Government, under the leadership of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed by the end of the century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.\n\nFrom the late 1970s, a number of agreements were signed enabling the potential peaceful export (and import) of nuclear material:\nThese International agreements created a market for Australia to mine and export uranium.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1984, the majority of what is now Kakadu National Park was created, surrounding but not including the Ranger uranium mine. Tension between mining and conservation values led to long running controversy around mining in the Park region.\n\nThe two themes for the 1980 Hiroshima Day march and rally in Sydney, sponsored by the Movement Against Uranium Mining (MAUM), were: \"Keep uranium in the ground\" and \"No to nuclear war.\" Later that year, the Sydney city council officially proclaimed Sydney nuclear-free, in an action similar to that taken by many other local councils throughout Australia.\n\nIn the 1980s, academic critics (such as Jim Falk) discussed the \"deadly connection\" between uranium mining, nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, linking Australia's nuclear policy to nuclear proliferation and the \"plutonium economy\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Australia experienced a significant growth of nuclear disarmament activism: \n\nOn Palm Sunday 1982, an estimated 100,000 Australians participated in anti-nuclear rallies in the nation's biggest cities. Growing year by year, the rallies drew 350,000 participants in 1985. The movement focused on halting Australia's uranium mining and exports, abolishing nuclear weapons, removing foreign military bases from Australia's soil, and creating a nuclear-free Pacific. Public opinion surveys found that about half of Australians opposed uranium mining and export, as well as the visits of U.S. nuclear warships, that 72 percent thought the use of nuclear weapons could never be justified, and that 80 percent favoured building a nuclear-free world. \nThe Nuclear Disarmament Party won a Senate seat in 1984, but soon faded from the political scene. The years of the Hawke-Keating ALP governments (1983–1996) were characterised by an \"uneasy standoff in the uranium debate\". The ALP acknowledged community feeling against uranium mining but was reluctant to move against the industry.\n\nThe 1986 Palm Sunday anti-nuclear rallies drew 250,000 people. In Melbourne, the seamen's union boycotted the arrival of foreign nuclear warships.\n\nAustralia's only nuclear energy education facility, the former School of Nuclear Engineering at the University of New South Wales, closed in 1986.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, and the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case. The Campaign Against Nuclear Energy disbanded itself in 1988, two years after the Chernobyl Disaster.\n\nThe government policy preventing new uranium mines continued into the 1990s, despite occasional reviews and debate. Following protest marches in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane during 1998, a proposed mine at Jabiluka was blocked.\n\nAlso in 1998, there was a proposal from an international consortium, Pangea Resources, to establish a nuclear waste dump in Western Australia. The plan, to store 20 per cent of the world's spent nuclear fuel and weapons material, was \"publicly condemned and abandoned\".\n\nIn 2000, the Ranger Uranium Mine in the Northern Territory and the Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam mine in South Australia continued to operate, but Nabarlek Uranium Mine had closed. A third uranium mine, Beverley Uranium Mine in SA, was also operating. Several advanced projects, such as Honeymoon in SA, Jabiluka in the Northern Territory and Yeelirrie in WA were on hold because of political and indigenous opposition.\nIn May 2000 there was an anti-nuclear demonstration at the Beverley Uranium Mine, which involved about 100 protesters. Ten of the protesters were mistreated by police and were later awarded more than $700,000 in damages from the South Australian government.\n\nFollowing the McClelland Royal Commission, a large clean-up was completed in outback South Australia in 2000, after nuclear testing at Maralinga during the 1950s contaminated the region. The cleanup lasted three years, and cost over A$100 million, but there was controversy over the methods used and success of the operation.\n\nOn 17 December 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of a second research reactor. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility.\n\nAs uranium prices began rising from about 2003, proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to global warming and the Australian government began taking an interest. However, in June 2005, the Senate passed a motion opposing nuclear power for Australia. Then, in November 2006, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources released a pro-nuclear report into Australia's uranium. In late 2006 and early 2007, then Prime Minister John Howard made widely reported statements in favour of nuclear power, on environmental grounds.\n\nFaced with these proposals to examine nuclear power as a possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.\n\nThe Rudd Labor government elected in 2007 opposed nuclear power for Australia. The anti-nuclear movement continues to be active in Australia, opposing expansion of existing uranium mines, lobbying against the development of nuclear power in Australia, and criticising proposals for nuclear waste disposal sites, the main candidate being Muckaty station in the Northern Territory.\n\nBy April 2009, construction had begun on South Australia's third uranium mine— the Honeymoon Uranium Mine. In October 2009, the Australian government was continuing to plan for a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory. However, there was opposition from indigenous people, the NT government, and wider NT community. In November 2009, about 100 anti-nuclear protesters assembled outside the Alice Springs parliamentary sittings, urging the Northern Territory Government not to approve a nearby uranium mine site.\n\nAs of 2016, Australia has no nuclear power stations and the former Gillard Labor government was opposed to nuclear power for Australia. Australia has three operating uranium mines at Olympic Dam (Roxby) and Beverley – both in South Australia's north – and at Ranger in the Northern Territory. Australia has no nuclear weapons. Australia operates a research reactor which produces medical radioisotopes at OPAL.\n\nAs of early April 2010, more than 200 environmentalists and indigenous people gathered in Tennant Creek to oppose a radioactive waste dump being built on Muckaty Station in the Northern Territory.\n\nWestern Australia has a significant share of the Australia's uranium reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on uranium mining was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, many companies are exploring for uranium in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company BHP Billiton, planned to develop the Yeelirrie uranium project in a 17 billion dollar project. Two other projects in Western Australia are further advanced then BHP's Yeelirrie, these being the Lake Way uranium project, which is pursued by Toro Energy, and the Lake Maitland uranium project, pursued by Mega Uranium. But it is unlikely that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low.\nAs of late 2010, there are calls for Australians to debate whether the nation should adopt nuclear power as part of its energy mix. Nuclear power is seen to be \"a divisive issue that can arouse deep passions among those for and against\".\n\nFollowing the March 2011 Fukushima nuclear emergency in Japan, where three nuclear reactors were damaged by explosions, Ian Lowe sees the nuclear power option as being risky and unworkable for Australia. Lowe says nuclear power is too expensive, with insurmountable problems associated with waste disposal and weapons proliferation. It is also not a fast enough response to address climate change. Lowe advocates renewable energy which is \"quicker, less expensive and less dangerous than nuclear\".\n\nNuclear reactors are banned in Queensland and Tasmania. Uranium mining was previously prohibited in New South Wales under the Uranium Prohibition Act of 1986, however in 2012 Premier Barry O'Farrell amended the legislation to allow prospecting and mining of uranium in that State.\n\nIn December 2011, the sale of uranium to India was a contentious issue. MPs clashed over the issue and protesters were marched from Sydney's convention centre before Prime Minister Julia Gillard's motion to remove a party ban on uranium sales to India was narrowly supported 206 votes to 185. Long-time anti-nuclear campaigner Peter Garrett MP spoke against the motion.\n\nIn March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney.\n\nA site within Muckaty Station was considered for Australia's low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste storage and disposal facility. However, the plan was withdrawn following a High Court hearing, and one of the seven clans of traditional owners of Muckaty Station, the Ngapa clan, served papers on the Northern Land Council over the way the process was handled. \n\nMore than 400 people joined a \"Lizard's Revenge march\" to the Olympic Dam site in July 2012. The anti-nuclear activists, including Elder Kevin Buzzacott, protested against the mine expansion and the uranium industry. They say the company and the government have put short-term economic gain ahead of environmental and health concerns. Organiser Nectaria Calan said police harassed protesters, demanding identification and controlling access to and from their campsite. In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that the expansion was being postponed indefinitely pending investigation of a \"new and cheaper design\".\n\nHistorically, many prospective Australian uranium mines have been constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But it is unlikely that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.\n\nIn 2013, Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported nuclear power, saying: \"nuclear power is the only proven way of generating the base load power Australia needed without producing carbon pollution\". Abbott's Coalition’s Resources and Energy policy says \"the Coalition will formalise the agreement to sell uranium to India\". In 2016 under Malcolm Turnbull, both Australian political parties opened the door for uranium exports to India, with trade potentially starting in 2017.\n\nIn 2015, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill announced that a Royal Commission would be held to investigate the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. South Australia is currently home to four of Australia's five uranium mines, and the possibility of the state developing nuclear power generation, enrichment and waste storage facilities have previously proven to be contentious issues. The Royal Commission comes at a time of economic contraction for South Australia, which is suffering from job losses in mining and manufacturing sectors. Immediately following the announcement of the Royal Commission, emeritus Prof. Ian Lowe suggested that the current inquiry risks retreading old ground already covered by several previous public inquiries and proposals for nuclear industrialisation. Lowe referred to the 2006 UMPNER review's finding that substantial government subsidies would be required to support nuclear industrial development in Australia, and the 1976-78 Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (Fox Report), which drew attention to the problems of nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear waste. On 17 April 2015, Lowe was selected as one of five members of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission Expert Advisory Committee.\n\nThe case against nuclear power and uranium mining in Australia has been concerned with the environmental, political, economic, social and cultural impacts of nuclear energy; with the shortcomings of nuclear power as an energy source; and with presenting a sustainable energy strategy. The most prominent adverse impact of nuclear power is seen to be its potential contribution towards proliferation of nuclear weapons. For example, the 1976 Ranger Inquiry report stated that \"The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry\".\n\nThe health risks associated with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. This has been the case worldwide because of accidents like the Chernobyl disaster, but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff, who are medical practitioners.\n\nThe economics of nuclear power has been a factor in anti-nuclear campaigns, with critics arguing that such power is uneconomical in Australia, particularly given the country's abundance of coal resources.\n\nAccording to the anti-nuclear movement, most of the problems with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing solution to the problem of long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.\n\nA 2009 poll conducted by the Uranium Information Centre found that Australians in the 40 to 55 years age group are the \"most trenchantly opposed to nuclear power\". This generation was raised during the Cold War, experienced the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s, witnessed the 1979 partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor in the USA, and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. It was the generation which was also subject to cultural influences including feature films such as the \"nuclear industry conspiracies\" \"The China Syndrome\" and \"Silkwood\" and the apocalyptic \"Dr Strangelove\". Younger people are \"less resistant\" to the idea of nuclear power in Australia. Analysis of opinion polls from 2012 shows a \"significant decrease in favourable views of nuclear power\" following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.\n\nIndigenous land owners have consistently opposed uranium mining and have spoken out about the adverse impact it has on their communities. The British nuclear tests at Maralinga were found to have left significant radiation hazards in land given back to the Maralinga Tjarutja people, and the issue continues to cause indigenous opposition.\n\nThere are several prominent Australians who have publicly expressed anti-nuclear views:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5647844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5647844", "title": "Atlantic Canadian English", "text": "Atlantic Canadian English\n\nAtlantic Canadian English is a class of Canadian English dialects spoken in the Atlantic provinces of Canada and is notably distinct from Standard Canadian English. Atlantic Canadian English comprises Canadian Maritime English and Newfoundland English. It is mostly influenced by British and Irish English, and some Acadian French. Atlantic Canada is the Easternmost region of Canada, comprising four provinces located on the Atlantic coast - the three Maritime provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, as well as Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the Atlantic Provinces in 2016 was about 2,300,000 on a land area of approximately half a million square kilometers, with Nova Scotia being the most populous province, and its capital, Halifax, the most populous city.\n\nCanadian English owes its very existence to important historical events, especially: the Treaty of Paris of 1763. English was first spoken in Canada in the 17th century, in seasonal fishing communities along the Atlantic coast, including the island of Newfoundland, and at fur trade posts around Hudson Bay. Treated as a marker of upper-class prestige in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th, Canadian dainty was marked by the use of some features of British English pronunciation, resulting in an accent similar to the Mid-Atlantic accent known in the United States. This accent faded in prominence following World War II, when it became stigmatized as pretentious, and is now almost never heard in contemporary Canadian life outside of archival recordings used in film, television or radio documentaries.\n\n\"The Atlas of North American English\" (2006) revealed many of the sound changes active within Atlantic Canadian English, including the fronting of and full Canadian raising. This means the diphthongs and are raised to, respectively, and before voiceless consonants like , , , , . In all Atlantic Canadian English, (the \"short \"a\" sound\") is raised before nasal consonants. This is strongly true in Nova Scotia's Sydney English specifically, which also features a merger of and (e.g. making \"haggle\" sound like \"Hagel\"). This merger, typical of Standard Canadian English as well, is not typical however of the rest of Atlantic Canadian English. Nova's Scotia's Halifax English and New Brunswick's Saint John English show a New York City-like \"æ\" split (so \"bad\" and \"bag\" have a different vowel sound than \"bat\" and \"back\"). Nova Scotia's Lunenburg English may show non-rhotic behaviour. An influence of Irish and Scottish English features is noticeable in Newfoundland English, including a fronting of ~, the cheer–chair merger, the line–loin merger, and a distinct lack of the marry–merry merger. Nova Scotia English generally has a conservative compared with other Canadian English. \n\nThe flapping of intervocalic and to an alveolar tap between vowels, as well as pronouncing it as a glottal stop , is less common in the Maritimes than elsewhere in Canada, so that \"battery\" is pronounced instead of with a glottal stop. The varied, but similar, Maritimer accents are influenced by an overwhelming majority of early Scottish and Irish immigration namely in the regions of Saint John, Miramichi, Cape Breton and parts of Halifax.\n\nThe phonology of Maritimer English has some unique features:\n\nCanadian raising affects vowels before voiceless consonants like , , , and . Vowels before voiced consonants like , , , and are usually not raised.\n\nSince Canadian Raising only occurs before the voiceless consonants /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /th/ and /s/, Canadian English distinguishes the raised and unraised vowels in pairs of words like type v. tie, write v. ride, spike v. spy, shout v. loud, south v. sound, or house v. how.\n\nThe interrogative \"right?\", raised to , is also used as an adverb, as in \"It was right foggy today!\". This sense may be influenced by Welsh word \"reit\" , which means \"very, rather, or considerably\". \"Right\" is often, though less today than before, used with this meaning in the American South, too. \"Some\" is used as an adverb as well, especially in Nova Scotia, as in \"This cake is some good!\". Another example is \"s'pose\" or \"s'poseda\" for \"suppose\" or \"supposed to\". Such expressions tend to be widely used in the rural Maritimes, but are less common in urban areas.\n\nTerminal hard consonants are often dropped from pronunciation when found in sentences. \"Ol'\" rather than \"old\", \"col'\" rather than \"cold\", \"tha'\" rather than \"that\", \"suppose'\" rather than \"supposed.\" (with the -s pronounced softly, rather than as a -z). When it is pronounced it is softly, almost imperceptibly.\n\nCommon in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, but also found in downeast Maine, is aspirated speech; i.e.,\"Yeah\" or \"No\", spoken while inhaling. (colloquial pronunciation). This speech pattern bears no particular significance, other than its unusual nature. Competitive aspirated speech has been observed, with the intensity of aspiration increasing as conversation passes from one person to the next. The speaker is generally unaware of using this technique, and will frequently deny using it, when confronted. This is often referred to as a \"Gaelic Gasp.\"\n\nIndividual words and dialects may vary between provinces, and indeed, will vary between towns. On Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia, \"mouth\" may be pronounced \"mewth\". In Newfoundland, \"Mouth\" may be pronounced as \"Mout\". Either province may also pronounce \"Look\" as simply \"Luh\", but only if the word was not used as part of a bigger sentence, such as pointing in a direction and saying \"luh!\", otherwise the letter \"k\" is pronounced, \"Look here!\". The phrase (for eating) \"get it into you\" is spoken quickly and almost as one word, \"giggit-inta-ya\". The phrase \"Go away with you\" (a phrase of disbelief) would be pronounced \"go-way-with-ya\" or \"go-wee-witch-ya\" spoken quickly as if all of one word. Having a big meal may be called \"having a big feed\" or \"having a big scoff\". Slang terms that would otherwise be considered insults in other parts of Canada are almost terms of endearment within Atlantic Canada; such as inquiring where \"shitty-arse\" is, or calling someone who works for you \"my Kunta Kinti\". Other examples are nearly endless.\n\nTerms of British origin are very much still a part of Maritime English, depending on dialects. \"Chesterfield,\" \"front room,\" \"gob\", and \"parlour\" are examples of this. Another is the use of the somewhat vulgar \"arse\" in place of the American and central and western Canadian form, \"ass\". Other examples of British terms that may be heard in the rest of Canada, but less frequently than in the Maritimes, include \"holiday\" for vacation, \"sweets\" for candy, \"Mum\" for Mom and \"cellar\" for basement. Prince Edward Islanders often use more British terms than any other Maritimers, due to the overwhelming homogeneity of the province's Scottish and Irish ethnicity. Examples include referring to the hood of a car as an \"engine bonnet\" and a barn as a \"byre.\" The latter is much more common amongst older speakers. The arse end of a car may also be referred to as the \"boot\". \"Go to the arse end of the car, lift the bonnet, and check inside the boot. Luh! I found the tire iron! Right where it's s'poseda be!\". Going for a \"ramble\" would refer to going for a long walk for pleasure. \n\nTruancy is often referred to as playing hookey, skipping, ditching, or jigging. Some Maritimers, particularly Prince Edward Islanders, will describe treacherous winter roads as \"slippy\" rather than \"slippery\". Some Maritimers will also add an /s/ to the end of \"somewhere\" and \"anywhere\", producing \"somewheres\" and \"anywheres\"\n\nThe names of meals are not always used in the same way as in other parts of the country: \"dinner\" may refer to the meal eaten at midday; \"supper\" is the evening meal; and occasionally, particularly with older speakers, \"lunch\" refers to a snack eaten outside of regular meal times (for example, a \"bed lunch\" is a bedtime snack). \"Breakfast\" is used for the morning meal, as it is elsewhere in Canada.\n\nMany terms and phrases that are derived from the region's nautical background and are often shared with Britain, Ireland and New England. Examples of this include terms such as \"reef\" in place of \"pull\" and a deckhand on a boat being referred to as a \"cork.\" A common way to describe drunkenness is to state that someone is \"three sheets to the wind,\" which is a phrase used to describe a ship swaying in the wind due to loose sheets (ropes) in the rigging. A \"jigger\" can refer to any object, \"I can't change the TV channel without the jigger!\" The phrase \"I like the cut of your jib\" (a jib is a forward sail which cuts or draws into the wind) means to understand or agree what someone is talking about in a conversation, or to approve of ones actions. It is not uncommon to hear one use the word \"downstream\" to refer to any location being a distance or direction to head to; such as \"Im heading downstream into town\". The word \"Landed\" (a boat landing on shore) can refer to arriving at a location by any means; \"I landed at my neighbours house last night\".\n\nCanadian English shows a more balanced mixture of American and British standards is spelling.\n\n"}

{"id": "47336397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47336397", "title": "Barnim Panorama", "text": "Barnim Panorama\n\nThe Barnim Panorama, owned by the municipality Wandlitz, was created in September 2013 by combining the Agrarmuseum Wandlitz and the visitor center of the Barnim Nature Park. It has the largest agricultural collection in Brandenburg and offers six themed rooms to give visitors an insight into the 200-year-old history of agriculture in Brandenburg. The museum in the quarter Wandlitz was built in 1955 and could only use provisional arrangements until 2013. Because of the growing demand for more exhibition space and better opportunities to present its collection, the quarter decided to construct a new building across the street from the original museum.\n\nIn 1955 the Heimatforscher (somebody researching his homeland, home town or region) and owner of the Meierhof Walter Blankenburg (1901-1984) from Wandlitz opened the so-called “Heimatstube”. He and his wife Margot had been collecting various commonly used items from rural households with the help of other residents over the course of several years that could now be shown for the first time raising a lot of public interest. Over time and with public funding the “Heimatstube” was expanded into a museum by repurposing two barns, a stable, and a 5,381 square foot (500m²) large auditorium gifted by the Free German Trade Union Federation was added to cope with the fast growing collection, now largely consisting of agricultural equipment and machinery. The museum staff was supported on an academic level by the Berlin State Museums.\n\nIn 1975 the museum was renamed to \"Museum der agraren Produktivkräfte\" (approximate translation: Museum of the Agricultural Workforce).\n\nThe sculpture, created by Walter Arnold, positioned in front of the multi-purpose building in the 1980s was a long-time loan to the museum from a museum in Berlin. The sculpture was given back to its original museum in Berlin in 2011.\n\nAfter the German reunification the museum would continue to exist with the financial support of the municipality Wandlitz and a newly founded booster club. In 1990 the state Brandenburg changed the museum’s name to “Agrarmuseum Wandlitz” (Agricultural Museum Wandlitz). Throughout the following years its collection has become the biggest, historic agricultural collection in Brandenburg. Until spring 2013 the total exhibition space was about 21,571 square foot (2000m²) large. One of the most noticeable exhibits is the historic “Dampfpflug” (a plough working with a steam engine), which was situated outside the museum under a separate roof. Many functional tractors and other agricultural machinery from different eras can be seen at the museum. In other areas of the exhibition, traditional craft and the historic rural household are portrayed. The exhibits of the “Heimatstube” give special insight into the history of the village and its residents.\n\nThe museum once owned a farm in the village, where different kind of potatoes were grown.\n\nThe museum is financed only by the municipality Wandlitz.\n\nThe museum had planned a new building which would replace the run-down architecture of the old one, and for a long time the museum could not build it, but in 2011 those plans were realized. In close proximity to the old museum, the municipality Wandlitz started the construction of a new complex of buildings, known as the Barnim Panorama, which would house the “Agrarmuseum Wandlitz” (Agricultural Museum Wandlitz), as well as the visitor center of the Barnim Nature Park.\n\nA foundation stone ceremony for the Barnim Panorama was held during the annual museum festival on May 15, 2011. The new complex of buildings has the same appearance as the rest of the villages’ stables, barns, and the main building, which is made from stone. The building also resembles a historic “Dreiseithof” (a square farm complex that has buildings on three of its sides). The neighboring landmarked school was integrated into the complex of buildings that form the Barnim Panorama, which is now the new headquarter of the Barnim Nature Park, and provides offices for the management of the museum.\n\nThe architects of \"Reese Lubic Woehrlin\" from Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg won the architectural design competition, and designed the new museum. In total the project cost an estimated 6.2 million €, including approximately 5 million € for the construction. The European Union and the state Brandenburg contributed with 3.7 million € in subsidies.\n\nIn 2012 local residents suggested naming the new museum after its founder Walter Blankenburg. The Cultural Affairs Director of the municipality then drafted a resolution to name the Barnim Panorama “Walter-Blankenburg-Hof” (Walter-Blankenburg-Farm), but the booster club of the museum denied the resolution because the lot was not owned by the Blankenburg family. Instead, the booster club wanted to name the whole plaza after Walter Blankenburg. Finally the municipality Wandlitz decided to name a street after Walter Blankenburg: the \"Walter-Blankenburg-Weg\".\n\nThe Barnim Panorama was officially opened on September 7, 2013. The Brandenburg Department of Construction awarded Stefan Woehrlin’s team of architects with the “Baukulturpreis” (an award from the state of Brandenburg for architects and civil engineers) on October 12, 2013. The reasons for giving the award to Stefan Woehrlin’s team especially underlined their predominant use of environmentally sustainable construction materials, and the design towards building a low-energy house with zero emissions. The awarded money of 2,500 € was gifted to the booster club and the Barnim Nature Park by the architects.\n\nWhat is especially notable are the walk-on-able map of the local area, and the large outside area with a lot of space for children to play in. The tractor collection is inside an exhibit hall made mostly from glass. Other exhibit objects were rearranged in the new museum.\n\nThe whole new building complex provides universal access.\n\nThe complete former museum now uses three stories of the new building, and the whole exposition is unified under the motto “Geformte und genutzte Landschaft” (Shaped and Formed Landscape). The foyer, a shop, as well as the exhibits “Wild Barnim” (a multimedia installation from fall 2014), “Moving Soil”, and the “Tractor herd” are situated on the bottom floor. Visitors will also find the exit to the garden and a depot containing various combine harvesters on the bottom floor. On the upper floor there are two major topics presented: “Stories from the Barnim,” and “Rural Life.” A portion of the available space is reserved only for special exhibits. Lastly there is a panoramic window that gives the visitors a view upon the Wandlitzer See (lake), and a walk-on-able map of the Barnim Nature Park which simulates a bird’s-eye view.\n\nThe Barnim Panorama is open every day (except Friday) from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The admission fee for adults is 6 € with lower prices for children, families, and groups.\n\nThis modern media presentation was created after a limited competition held by the \"“Bärlin Team Eventdesign”\" corporation, and produced in cooperation with the filmmakers \"“filmfritzen.tv”\". An infinitely looped movie is projected onto a 45 x 10 foot (14 x 3 m) large, curved surface. It shows the shaping of the Barnim landscape in impressive images. Seven different scenes are shown without the use of a commentator but rather with the sounds of nature and other self-composed sound effects. It aims to teach visitors about the Ice Age and the following melting of the glaciers as well as the adjacent formation of lakes, forests, and swamps. The multimedia installation is rounded off by special coordinated light effects.\n\n2014 - 2015: Out into the Nature (from the German: \"“Raus ins Grüne”\") deals with the early tourism in the region at the beginning of the 20th century. It especially highlights the influence of the rail road “Heidekrautbahn”, the Liepnitzsee (lake), and the Wandlitzer See (lake) as catalysts for the tourism boom that is still noticeable today.\n\n2015 - 2016: Wolf and Human – Searching for Traces in Brandenburg (from the German \"“Wolf und Mensch – auf Spurensuche in Brandenburg”\") The once very dense wolf population in Brandenburg was for the last 200 years almost nonexistent. But as the wolf population is starting to grow again and the animals are returning to their historic habitat, many questions arise about how humans and wolves can live together peacefully. The exhibition shows both historic and current aspects of their relationship and aims to provide a platform for the current public discussion.\n\n2016: Waldsiedlung Wandlitz - A Landscape of Power (from the German \"“Waldsiedlung Wandlitz - Eine Landschaft der Macht”\") aims to give an historical-critical overview of the SED history of the housing-complex used by the political leadership of the German Democratic Republic from 1958 to 1990.\n\nVisitors are getting insight into the day-to-day life of the SED officials, their families, and their security staff living inside the locked off complex. The exhibition asks about the impact of the housing-complex on the region and provides a geopraphical overview on its large walk-on-able map. It also highlights the connections between the growing media coverage of the housing-complex in the last years of the German Democratic Republic to the Peaceful Revolution of 1989. The exhibition is accompanied by multiple informative installations on the area of the former housing complex.\n\nIt was funded by the state Brandenburg and the Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship.\n\nThe first museum festival took place in 1979. It was celebrated with live music and a parade of all the exhibits, that were still in tact. The festival became an annual event that takes place in May and offers insight into traditional craft and presentations of special items from the museum’s collection to up to 2,500 visitors in the historic center of the quarter Wandlitz. Many small artisans, craftsmen, and artists, as well as voluntary associations participate in the festival.\n\nSince approximately 1983, annual summer concerts invite visitors to experience the museum in a different way. Musicians play at the museum on four different dates between June and September inside a scenic installation in the museum. In July, 2009, for example, melodies from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven could be heard by the visitors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "672077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=672077", "title": "Beur", "text": "Beur\n\nBeur (or alternatively, Rebeu) is a colloquial term to designate European-born people whose parents or grandparents are immigrants from North Africa, more specifically Maghreb. The equivalent term for a female beur is a beurette. The term \"rebeu\" is neither applicable to females nor does it have a female version.\n\nThe word beur was coined using verlan for the word \"arabe\", which means Arabic or Arab in French. Since the late 1990s, a lot of young people have used the twice-verlanised term \"rebeu\" as a synonym. This term is now the dominant term used by the younger generations (under 30). The word \"beurette\", the female version of \"beur\", is created by adding the -ette female suffix in French. In French many slang words are created by simply reversing the word in terms of spelling and then reading it out. Because of French grammar rules, the new word is usually completely different than reversing the word phonetically. The word \"beurgeois\" is derived from a combination of the words \"beur\" and \"bourgeois\".\n\nThe term is slightly familiar and not advised in formal speech with respect to etiquette though it will be used in the media. The term \"beur\" is used to refer to all the Arabs from either Maghreb or Mashreq areas of the Arab world born in France.\n\nThe term \"beur\" is of French origin, and as such was traditionally mostly used in French-speaking European countries such as France (where the term originates), Belgium, Monaco, Luxembourg and Switzerland, as well as in North Africa. Due to cultural integration between such peoples across Europe, the term is now popular in other parts of Europe with a large North African community, such as the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy.\n\nSomeone who is a North African from Europe is not necessarily a \"beur\": the term is applied to those who have a hybrid culture between their North African roots and their status as someone who was born and raised in Europe. There is a big difference between a French Moroccan and a \"beur\", for instance. There is a strong identity and solidarity between these people that exists irrespective of which North African country one comes from, nor the European country they were raised in: a French Algerian will see another French Algerian as they would a French Moroccan, a Belgium Moroccan or a Belgian Algerian. The term can apply to people of any race or religion, such as Arabs, Berbers, Pied-Noir or Jews or even Blacks who originate from North Africa.\n\nSince 1992, the BEUR.FM radio station has broadcast nationwide (106.7 FM in Paris). It specializes in North African Arab music and other genres (funk, rap, ... ) discussion, and news.\n\n\n\nOn Beur Literature:\n\n"}

A portion of the projected growth involved immigration to Australia, which proved controversial.\n\nIn 2009, Rudd stated that he was in favour of a \"big Australia\" in response to a demographic projection in the government's \"Intergenerational Report\" which showed that the population of Australia would increase from 22 million in 2010 to 35 million in 2050. A portion of the growth involved continued high rates of immigration to Australia, which proved controversial. In April 2010 Rudd appointed Tony Burke to the position of Minister for Population and asked him to develop a population policy.\n\nJulia Gillard, who ousted Rudd from office in June 2010, stated that she did not support Rudd's position shortly after taking over on the grounds that a \"big Australia\" would be unsustainable. Gillard's position was \"a sustainable Australia, not a big Australia\". The Government released a \"sustainable population strategy\" in May 2011 which did not specify a target population. In October 2011 trade minister Craig Emerson released a paper with Gillard's approval which advocated for continued rapid rates of population growth.\n\nThe omission of population targets from the 2011 Sustainable Population Strategy doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. In effect, the Strategy took as read the near doubling of Net Overseas Migration (NOM) implemented in the closing years of the Howard Government. \n\nThe official population policies and targets continued to be published elsewhere. Treasury Budget Paper No. 3 of 2011 “assumes” Net Overseas Migration (NOM) of 175,000 plus, with population growth on 1.5 per cent. The 2015 Intergenerational Report makes similar or even higher assumptions about migration and population growth than that of 2010, leading to a population of nearly 40 million by 2054-55. Under Coalition Government, Budget Paper No. 3 of 2018 “assumes” 230,000 plus for NOM and population growth of 1.6 per cent. This is one of the highest percentages in the OECD. \n\nDemographic projections released by the Queensland Centre for Population Research in 2011 found that there is a 50 per cent likelihood of Australia's population being larger than 35 million by 2050.\n\n\n"}

In 2017 Lesotho became the first African nation to grant a license for the cultivation of medical cannabis.\n\nCannabis is known as \"matekoane\" in Sesotho language.\n\nCannabis use dates back to at least the 16th century in Lesotho, when the Koena people traded cannabis to the local San tribes in exchange for land around 1550. By the 19th century, cannabis was a staple crop in the kingdom.\n\nCannabis is cultivated almost everywhere in Lesotho, including the capital, but the primary cultivation is in the central mountain zones and western foothills.\n\nIn 2017, the Lesotho Ministry of Health licensed a South African firm to grow cannabis in Lesotho for medical and scientific purposes, the first such authorized establishment in Africa.\n\nIn late 2017/early 2018, the Lesotho government licensed 5 companies to produce medical marijuana. Three of these companies have been partially, or entirely acquired by established licensed Canadian producers: \n\n\nIn one joint South African-Lesotho operation in 2006, 47 tons of cannabis were seized.

The population is enumerated every 5 years (beginning on 1970, except in 2005 where it was moved to 2007 due to budgetary constraints) and the results are used to allocate Congressional seats (congressional apportionment) and government program funding. \n\nBy virtue of Republic Act No. 10625 known as the Philippine Statistical Act of 2013, censuses in the Philippines are administered by the Philippine Statistics Authority. \n\nThe first census in the Philippines in 1591, was based on tributes collected and yielded about 666,712 people in the islands. In 1799, Friar Manuel Buzeta estimated the population count as 1,502,574. However, the first official census in the Philippines was carried out by the Spanish government pursuant to a royal decree calling for the counting of persons living as of the midnight of December 31, 1877. Based on this census, the Philippines had a population of 5,567,685 as of the reference date. This was followed by another censuses, the 1887 census that yielded a count of 5,984,727,\nThe first census conducted by the U.S. military forces took place in 1903 to fulfill Public Act 467 which was approved by the United States Philippine Commission on October 6, 1902.\n\nA four-volume description of this census was on hand some years ago at the National Archives in San Bruno, California, but the volumes appear to have since been misplaced.\nFor years between the censuses, the Philippine Statistics Authority issues estimates made using surveys and statistical systems. \n\nBased on the population census in 2015, the national population is 100,981,437 as of August 1, 2015. From 2010 to 2015, the population grew by 1.72% per year on the average.\n\nSantos said the Philippines’ population expanded from 1960 to 1970 at an annual rate of 3.01 percent.

{"id": "152565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152565", "title": "Courtesy name", "text": "Courtesy name\n\nA courtesy name (, \"zi\"), also known as a style name, is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name. This practice is a tradition in East Asian cultures, including China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.\n\nFormerly in China, the \"zi\" would replace a male's given name when he turned twenty, as a symbol of adulthood and respect. It could be given either by the parents or by the first personal teacher on the first day of family school. Females might substitute their given name for a \"zi\" upon marriage. One also may adopt a self-chosen courtesy name.\n\nIn China the popularity of the custom has declined to a large extent since the May Fourth Movement in 1919.\n\nA courtesy name is not to be confused with an art name (\"hào\", , Korean: 호), another frequently mentioned term for an alternative name in Asian culture-based context. An art name is usually associated with art and is more of a literary name or a pseudonym that is more spontaneous, compared to a courtesy name.\n\nThe \"zì\", sometimes called the \"biǎozì\"（表字）or \"courtesy name\", is a name traditionally given to Chinese males at the age of 20, marking their coming of age. It was sometimes given to females upon marriage. The practice is no longer common in modern Chinese society. According to the \"Book of Rites\", after a man reaches adulthood, it is disrespectful for others of the same generation to address him by his given name, or \"míng\". Thus, the given name was reserved for oneself and one's elders, while the zì would be used by adults of the same generation to refer to one another on formal occasions or in writing; hence the term \"courtesy name\".\n\nThe \"zì\" is mostly disyllabic, consisting of two Chinese characters, and is usually based on the meaning of the \"míng\" or given name. Yan Zhitui of the Northern Qi dynasty believed that while the purpose of the \"míng\" was to distinguish one person from another, he asserted that the \"zì\" should express the bearer's moral integrity.\n\nThe relation which often exists between a person's \"zì\" and \"míng\" may be seen in the case of Chiang Kai-shek (蔣介石), whose \"ming\" was Zhōngzhèng (中正，romanized as Chung-cheng) and \"zi\" was Jieshi (介石，romanized as Kai-shek). Thus he was also called 蔣中正 (Chiang Chung-cheng) in some contexts.\n\nAnother way to form a \"zì\" is to use the homophonic character \"zǐ\" (子) – a respectful title for a male – as the first character of the disyllabic \"zì\". Thus, for example, Gongsun Qiao's \"zì\" was Zǐchǎn (子產), and Du Fu's: Zǐměi (子美).\n\nIt is also common to construct a \"zì\" by using as the first character one which expresses the bearer's birth order among male siblings in his family. Thus Confucius, whose name was Kǒng Qiū (孔丘), was given the \"zì\" Zhòngní (仲尼), where the first character \"zhòng\" indicates that he was the second son born into his family. The characters commonly used are bó (伯) for the first, zhòng (仲) for the second, shū (叔) for the third, and jì (季) typically for the youngest, if the family consists of more than three sons. General Sun Jian's four sons, for instance, were Sun Ce (伯符, Bófú), Sun Quan (仲謀, Zhòngmóu), Sun Yi (叔弼, Shūbì) and Sun Kuang (季佐, Jìzuǒ).\n\nThe use of \"zì\" began during the Shang dynasty, and slowly developed into a system which became most widespread during the succeeding Zhou dynasty. During this period, women were also given \"zì\". The \"zì\" given to a woman was generally composed of a character indicating her birth order among female siblings and her surname. For example, Mèng Jiāng (孟姜) was the eldest daughter in the Jiāng family.\n\nPrior to the twentieth century, sinicized Koreans, Vietnamese, and Japanese were also referred to by their \"zì\". The practice was also adopted by some Mongols and Manchus after the Qing conquest of China.\n\n"}

Noted as \"one of the country’s first great independent megachurches\", it gained an international reputation for combining liturgical arts, such as dance and drama, with cutting edge . He was also known for his lifelong crusade against racism.\n\nPaulk's reputation was severely tarnished in his later years by allegations of sexual misconduct, including several illicit relationships and accusations that he had molested children.\n\nPaulk was born on May 30, 1927, in Appling County, Georgia, near Savannah, to Earl Pearly Paulk, Sr. and Addie Mae Tomberlin Paulk. His father was a minister in the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), eventually rising to assistant general overseer of the denomination. At 17, Paulk said he received a call from God to enter ministry.\n\nPaulk graduated from Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina in the 1940s, and earned his divinity degree from Emory University's Candler School of Theology, becoming the first Pentecostal to attend the historically Methodist seminary. While at Candler, he married Norma Davis, a girl who had attended his father's church.\n\nWhile attending Furman, Paulk served as an associate pastor at his father's church in Greenville. While at Candler, he was called to his first pulpit, a Church of God in Buford, Georgia; north of Atlanta. It was during this time that he began preaching against racism. Years later, he said that he was influenced by seeing his uncle shoot a black friend in the back for cutting corners while plowing cotton. Paulk's stance was not typical for his time; it had long been common for white Southern preachers to use the Bible to justify support for racial bars.\n\nIn 1952, Paulk was named pastor of Hemphill Avenue Church of God (now Mount Paran Church of God) in Atlanta just as the civil rights movement was getting underway. He was one of the few white pastors who marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. Not long after taking over at Hemphill, Paulk became a member of \"Concerned Clergy,\" an interracial group of Atlanta pastors who opposed racial segregation. The group was led by King's father, Martin Luther King, Sr., and met in the basement of the elder King's church, Ebenezer Baptist Church. During this time, he served on a committee that observed Georgia's then-segregated schools, and determined that \"separate but equal\" was a fiction.\n\nEarl Paulk said that he signed \"The Atlanta Ministers' Manifesto\", a statement prepared in the fall of 1957 by a group of 80 clergymen in Georgia, relating specifically to the violence in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in general to issues of racial integration from the point of view of Christian social responsibility., but examination of that document does not include Earl Paulk's signature. His name does, however, appear in the second Ministers' Manifesto of 1958.\n\nPaulk resigned from Hemphill in 1960. Officially, it was due to differences of opinion with Church of God leaders regarding his stance on racial integration, as well as the fact he allowed women in his church to wear jewelry (at the time, the Church of God, like many Pentecostal denominations, strongly admonished women against wearing makeup or jewelry). However, it later emerged that he'd had an extramarital affair with a woman in his church.\n\nIn 1960, Paulk founded the Gospel Harvesters Evangelistic Association with his wife, his brother Don (also a former Church of God pastor), and his sister-in-law Clariece. During its early years, the church held services at St. John's Lutheran Church in the Little Five Points section of Atlanta. It later moved to its own building in nearby Inman Park.\n\nFrom the first day, Paulk was committed to opening the doors of his church to all people, regardless of racial or economic background. Not surprisingly given his opposition to segregation, he was one of the first white pastors to open the doors of his church to blacks. This stance wasn't popular even with some members of his own church; when the first blacks set foot in the church in the early 1960s, several whites walked out in protest. In response, one of the whites who remained, Ida Williams, gave a 15-minute sermon in which she said, \"It is not the will of God that we should have prejudice.\" To this day, the church has a fairly large black membership for a church led by a white pastor.\n\nPaulk remained active in the civil rights movement during this time. For instance, at a meeting of Concerned Clergy, he was one of the pastors who blessed the first civil rights march in Selma, Alabama. Later, he and his brother picketed a produce market which sold food to blacks at inflated prices. The resulting public outcry caused the store's closure.\n\nIn 1972, the church moved to the southern part of DeKalb County and became known as Chapel Hill Harvester Church. While there, the church experienced massive growth, enlarging the building several times, having services in a tent, then moving its services into a building known as the \"K-Center.\" In 1989, the church broke ground on a large, Gothic-like building off Interstate 285 in Decatur. Dedicated in 1991, this building was known as the \"Cathedral of the Holy Spirit,\" and eventually the church changed its name to \"the Cathedral at Chapel Hill.\"\n\nThe church was famed for combining visual arts (particularly with the dance team) with a liturgical style. Under his sister Clariece, who headed the church's arts ministry for many years, it became known for its music ministry as well. Paulk, who had previous television and radio ministry experience, later expanded his media ministry and for many years his show aired on TBN. He also was a semi-regular guest on TBN's \"Praise the Lord.\"\n\nIn 1982, Paulk was ordained as a bishop in the International Communion of Charismatic Churches. His public housing ministry was named one of a \"thousand points of light\" by President George H. W. Bush. He ultimately gave up the senior pastor's title to his brother Don, but was still acknowledged as the real power.\n\nIn later years, he became one of the few mainstream Pentecostal/charismatic leaders to welcome openly gay and lesbian members.\n\nPaulk's church population numbers exploded during the 1990s; at its height it had 12,000 members. Recent scandals and changes in doctrine (see below) have significantly diminished its numbers; as of 2018 it has barely 100 members.\n\nIn August 2009, with the church property facing foreclosure, the campus was sold to another local growing church; who then allowed Chapel Hill to use their old sanctuary. In 2012, it changed its name to Spirit and Truth Sanctuary, and moved their heretical ministry to another part of Decatur.\n\nPaulk was involved with many sex scandals spanning several decades.\n\nIn 1992, six women accused Earl Paulk, Don Paulk and two other nephews who were ministers at the church, of sexual manipulation. One of them was Tricia Weeks, who had ghostwritten Paulk's autobiography. The story received considerable national coverage. Earl Paulk denied the allegations, claiming Weeks was either mentally unstable or under evil influences. However, he admitted the adulterous affair which forced him out of Hemphill Church of God 32 years earlier.\n\nIn 2001, Jessica Battle, a college student who had been part of the church’s arts ministry dance group, sued Paulk, accusing him of molesting her between the ages of 7 and 11, and later of forcing himself on her when she was 17. The suit was settled out of court in 2003 for $400,000, allegedly using money from Mona and Bobby Brewer.\n\nCindy Hall was born in 1960 and was one of the first children born into Chapel Hill Harvester. In 2003, she claimed that Paulk had convinced her into a lengthy affair that also included her having sex with Paulk's brother, Don. Hall alleges that the affair began in 1983 (in a manner very similar to Mona Brewer's a few years later) when Paulk prayed for her, then kissed her. He then would say he intended to \"make love\" to her. At one point, Paulk supposedly would tell her that they had a \"special gift of love outside holy matrimony\". The relationship became a weekly occurrence. She left the church in 2003 after being convinced that Jessica Battle was telling the truth about being molested by Paulk.\n\nHall chose not to become involved in the Brewers' lawsuit in part because of the length of time since her relationship with Paulk. Hall also claims that at Paulk’s request, she denied having sex with him, lying under oath at her deposition for the Battle case.\n\nMona Manning Brewer came to the church at the age of 19, four years after her conversion to Christianity. She was a Sunday School teacher who married Bobby Brewer, a minister at the church, in 1987. She was also featured regularly as a soloist on Paulk's television program. Brewer claimed that on September 11, 1989; Paulk felt \"'impressed of the Lord' to get to know her better\". She stopped by his office the next day, becoming a regular visitor. She alleged that a church official stated that there had been a \"word of knowledge\" claiming that she was about to enter a new relationship that would benefit her. That relationship became an extramarital affair that lasted 14 years.\n\nShe didn't break the relationship off until September 2003, years later, and didn't tell anyone until hearing about Cindy Hall. She then told her husband, who bided his time until the refinancing of the church was finished. In March 2004, Bobby Brewer angrily confronted Earl and Don Paulk at the Brewers' house, at one point hitting them both.\n\nThe Brewers eventually sued Paulk and his church on August 31, 2005, claiming Paulk misused his position to manipulate her into a sexual relationship for fourteen years and claiming Paulk owed US$400,000 for a loan Brewer issued to settle the Jessica Battle suit.\n\nPaulk denied the allegations from Brewers but his attorney acknowledged a sexual relationship between the bishop and Mona Brewer. Paulk claimed that the relationship was brief and that she was the initiator.\n\nOn Monday, March 5, 2007, at a pretrial hearing, the Brewers' lawyer wrote out a request for dismissal of the case by hand and handed it to lawyers for Paulk and the church. This was just as a ruling was about to come on a motion by Paulk's lawyers to dismiss the allegations. By dropping the case before the ruling, the Brewers left open the possibility of filing another suit with the same allegations. \"We were having difficulty even at this point getting witnesses to speak out against the acts of Bishop Paulk and the church,\" Levenson said. \"Sometimes you just have to do this.\"\n\nThe Brewers did, in fact, refile the suit with another judge. However, in February 2008, DeKalb County Judge Mark Anthony Scott threw the case into limbo when he ruled that she was \"of sound mind\" when she and Paulk began their relationship. Scott ordered the Brewers to reimburse Paulk for $1 million in legal expenses for filing a frivolous suit. Under Georgia law, the second suit they filed couldn't continue until the attorneys' fees were paid. However, in February 2009, the Georgia Court of Appeals reversed Scott's decision, citing numerous instances where Paulk himself stated under oath that he was Mona Brewer's \"spiritual adviser, minister, pastor and reverend.\"\n\nAlthough Paulk's death removed him from the suit, Mona Brewer said she fully intended to continue her suit against the church.\n\nOn October 14, 2007, Donnie Earl (D.E.) Paulk, who had become senior pastor of the church a few months earlier, informed a shocked congregation that a DNA test had revealed he was Earl Paulk's son, and not his nephew as he had believed for all his life.\n\nD.E. Paulk had been raised as the son of Don Paulk, Earl Paulk's brother. However, the test confirmed that he was the product of an illicit relationship between Earl Paulk and his sister-in-law, Clariece Paulk, who was married to Don. During the Brewer case, Earl Paulk had denied sleeping with anyone other than Mona Brewer. However, prosecutors and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation suspected he was lying, and triggered an investigation that led to a court-ordered paternity test on Donnie Earl Paulk. As a result, Paulk was charged with perjury on January 14, 2008. Two days later, Paulk pleaded guilty to the charges, for which he was sentenced to ten years probation and a thousand-dollar fine.\n\nDon Paulk later said that he has forgiven his brother, and said D.E.'s paternity \"made no difference in my love for my brother or my son.\"\n\nPaulk's daughter, Beth Bonner, appeared on WAGA in Atlanta on December 11, 2007 and apologized on behalf of her family for her father's misdeeds. She claimed to have confronted him as far back as the 1980s about his immorality. According to her, he had confessed and promised to reform, but reneged on his promise. Revelations that D.E. Paulk was her half-brother rather than her cousin had come as no surprise to her, she said.\n\nInterviewed on the same station the next day, Bonner's daughter, Penny White (née Penielle Brooke Bonner) went public with allegations, previously made only in court papers, that her grandfather Earl Paulk had sexually abused her as a child. Earl Paulk issued a statement through his lawyer denying the charge. \n\nPaulk found his theology criticized concerning accusations of promoting Dominionism and Word of Faith teaching. Before opening his doors to the gay and lesbian community, he had close ties to the Reconstructionist movement.\n\nPaulk died early on the morning of March 29, 2009, at Atlanta Medical Center after a long battle with cancer.\n\n"}

In the 1970s, she was convicted of kidnapping Patty Hearst. In 2003, she was convicted of murder in the second degree for being the shooter in a 1975 slaying that occurred while she and other SLA members were robbing a bank in California. She was sentenced to eight years in prison for the murder.\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, and raised in Clarendon Hills, Illinois, Harris was the daughter of Frederick Schwartz, an engineer, and had a middle-class upbringing. She graduated from Indiana University with a bachelor's degree in language arts.\n\nEmily and Bill Harris arrived in Berkeley, California in 1973 from Bloomington, Indiana. They came with their friends Gary Atwood and Angela Atwood. They soon joined a left-wing group that, among other things, visited prisoners in northern California. The Harrises met an escaped prisoner, Donald DeFreeze. They joined the SLA, created by Mizmoon Soltysik, Nancy Ling Perry, Joe Remiro, Russ Little, Willie Wolfe, Angela Atwood, Thero Wheeler and Camilla Hall. Emily Harris's \"nom de guerre\" was Yolanda. On November 6, the SLA committed its first public act, the assassination of popular Oakland, California school superintendent Marcus Foster. The SLA mistakenly thought Foster was behind a plan to create student identification cards for Oakland high schools. Subsequently, they kidnapped Patricia Hearst, the college student heir to the Hearst newspaper chain. \n\nEmily and Bill Harris took over the leadership of the SLA after six other SLA members died in a Los Angeles shootout with police and the house fire it triggered. After the fire, the Harrises spent over a year eluding the authorities with Hearst, and new members Kathleen Soliah, Josephine Soliah, Steven Soliah, Mike Bortin, Jim Kilgore, and Wendy Yoshimura. Hearst herself had since become a participant in SLA crimes. Yoshimura, Patty's closest friend while underground, was a fugitive for her involvement with explosives that were stored in a garage she rented. During that year the SLA committed a string of crimes, including an April 21, 1975, robbery of Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. During the robbery, 42-year-old Myrna Opsahl was shotgunned to death. Opsahl was depositing a church collection at the time. Patty Hearst stated in her 1982 autobiography \"Every Secret Thing\" that Emily was the shooter. Hearst also stated that Harris said, \"Oh, she's dead, but it doesn't really matter. She was a bourgeois pig anyway. Her husband is a doctor.\" Other SLA members had urged Harris not to bring the shotgun to the robbery, as it had accidentally discharged twice during preparations. \n\nThe Harrises were eventually arrested and served eight years in prison for the Hearst kidnapping. \nImprisoned at the California Institution for Women at Frontera, California, Emily Harris spent the first half of her term in solitary confinement. Emily learned computer programming in prison.\n\nAfter her release from prison in 1983, Harris became a computer programmer and began a successful computer consulting company. She worked at MGM Studios until her second conviction. She divorced her husband.\n\nFor over 25 years no one was charged in the Opsahl murder. The SLA wore wigs and masks during the Crocker Bank robbery, and left little evidence behind. However, with new forensics techniques, the FBI was eventually able to link shotgun pellets removed from Opsahl's body to shotgun shells found in an SLA hideout. Additional evidence mounted, and in January 2002 Harris and three other SLA members were charged with the Opsahl murder. Harris's bail was set at one million US dollars, which her supporters quickly gathered.\n\nThree former SLA members who had been granted immunity - Hearst, Steven Soliah, and Wendy Yoshimura - were set to testify for the prosecution in the Opsahl case. \n\nFacing a possible conviction, Harris and the others pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in November 2002. Harris was sentenced to eight additional years in prison; Bill Harris was sentenced to seven years and Kathleen Soliah and Michael Bortin were each sentenced to six years for their roles.\n\nEmily Harris was paroled in February 2007 after having served four years in prison.\n"}

Often referred to as \"English-speaking radio\" or \"Expat radio\" the broadcasts enables expats, vacationers and travelers to listen to radio in their native language while traveling abroad. The idea is that stations broadcast in English to popular holiday destinations such as Pattaya or the French Riviera or places with high expat communities. English language broadcasting also takes the form of military-backed radio such as the American Forces Network. However English-language radio based in foreign countries has to now compete with the introduction of internet radio and satellite technology that has increased listener's access to English-language radio based in \"home\" counties.\n\nThe first English-language radio in a foreign country transmission was thought to be in 1925 when Radio Paris broadcast from the Eiffel Tower, a show about fashion design, sponsored by Selfridges of London.\n\nWith end of World War II American and British forces began occupation of bases within regions of conquered Axis countries such as Germany and Okinawa for the enjoyment and informative power radio bring to both the troops and their families. Today traditions remain as the American Forces Network and the British Forces Broadcasting Service continue to provide English-language entertainment and information to troops stationed abroad in their respective countries or areas.\n\nNon-military English broadcasting gained momentum with the increase in globalization after World War II. As English-speaking business personnel and expat communities grew because of international trade and investment, so did the demand for English language entertainment. As the number of global English speakers has grown, demand from the local native market has grown as well. Stations that actively reach out to the local community such as International Community Radio Taipei have been on the rise.\n\nThe location of most English-language radio stations can be determined by their proximity to large populations of English speakers. Geneva, Switzerland, for example, has many English speakers and expatriates, also the Spanish coastal areas, and thus English radio broadcasts. Radio stations in places such as Baja California and Costa Rica also serve the increasing number of English speakers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3349493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3349493", "title": "Gender pay gap in the United States", "text": "Gender pay gap in the United States\n\nThe gender pay gap in the United States is the ratio of female-to-male median or average (depending on the source) yearly earnings among full-time, year-round workers.\n\nThe average woman's unadjusted annual salary has been cited as 78% to 82% of that of the average man's. However, after adjusting for choices made by male and female workers in college major, occupation, working hours, and parental leave, multiple studies find that pay rates between males and females varied by 5–6.6% or, females earning 94 cents to every dollar earned by their male counterparts. The remaining 6% of the gap has been speculated to originate from gender discrimination and a difference in ability and/or willingness to negotiate salaries.\n\nThe extent to which discrimination plays a role in explaining gender wage disparities is somewhat difficult to quantify, due to a number of potentially confounding variables. A 2010 research review by the majority staff of the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee reported that studies have consistently found unexplained pay differences even after controlling for measurable factors that are assumed to influence earnings – suggestive of unknown/unmeasurable contributing factors of which gender discrimination may be one. Other studies have found direct evidence of discrimination – for example, more jobs went to women when the applicant's sex was unknown during the hiring process.\n\nWomen's median yearly earnings (which is used by the Census Bureau to calculate its gap includes bonuses, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses weekly earnings which does not) relative to men's rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (from 60.2% to 71.6%), and less rapidly from 1990 to 2000 (from 71.6% to 73.7%) and from 2000 to 2009 (from 73.7% to 77.0%).\n\nIn 2016, women's earnings were lower than men's earnings in all states and the District of Columbia according to a survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The national female-to-male earnings ratio was 81.9%. Utah ranked lowest at 69.9% and Vermont ranked highest at 90.2%. \n\nWomen's median weekly earnings were lower than men's median weekly earnings in all industries in 2009. The industry with the largest gender pay gap was financial activities. Median weekly earnings of women employed in financial activities were 70.5% of men's median weekly earnings in that industry. Construction was the industry with the smallest gender pay gap, with women earning 92.2% of what men earned.\n\nIn 2009, women's weekly median earnings were higher than men's in only four of the 108 occupations for which sufficient data were available to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The four occupations with higher weekly median earnings for women than men were \"Other life, physical, and social science technicians\" (102.4%), \"bakers\" (104.0%), \"teacher assistants\" (104.6%), and \"dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers\" (111.1%). The four largest gender wage gaps were found in well-paying occupations such as \"Physicians and surgeons\" (64.2%), \"securities, commodities and financial services sales agents\" (64.5%), \"financial managers\" (66.6%), and \"other business operations specialists\" (66.9%).\n\nThe BLS report \"Highlights in Women's Earnings in 2003\" showed that there were only two occupations in 2003 where women's median weekly earnings exceeded men's. The two occupations were \"Packers and packagers, hand\" (101.4%) and \"Health diagnosing and treating\npractitioner support technicians\" (100.5%).\n\nIn 2009 Bloomberg News reported that the sixteen women heading companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index averaged earnings of $14.2 million in their latest fiscal years, 43 percent more than the male average. Bloomberg News also found that of the people who were S&P 500 CEOs in 2008, women got a 19 percent raise in 2009 while men took a 5 percent cut.\n\nSeveral studies of women in the legal profession reveal persistent gaps in partnership numbers at major American Law Firms. Despite the fact that women have graduated from law schools in equal numbers for over twenty years, only 16–19% of law firm partners are women.\n\nOn August 26, 2016 USAtoday reported that the Hollywood gender pay gap is wider than that for average working women and that it is worse for older women stars.\n\nWhile greater education increases women's overall earnings, education does not close the gender pay gap. Women earn less than men at all educational levels and the gender pay gap widens for persons with advanced degrees compared to people with high school education. In 2006, female high school graduates earned 69 percent of what their male counterparts earned ($29,410 for women, $42,466 for men), but women's earnings dropped to 66 percent of men's for those with advanced bachelor's degrees or more ($59,052 for women, $88,843 for men).\n\nThe earnings difference between women and men varies with age, with younger women more closely approaching pay equity than older women.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that, in 2013, female full-time workers had median weekly earnings of $706, compared to men's median weekly earnings of $860. Women aged 35 years and older earned 74% to 80% of the earnings of their male counterparts. Among younger workers, the earning differences between women and men were smaller, with women aged 16 to 24 earning 88.3% of men's earnings in the same age group ($423 and $479, respectively).\n\nAccording to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, young women in their twenties earned more than their male counterparts in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major reason for this is that women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.\n\nAccording to an analysis of Census Bureau data released by Reach Advisors in 2008, single childless women between ages 22 and 30 were earning more than their male counterparts in most United States cities, with incomes that were 8% greater than males on average. This shift is driven by the growing ranks of women who attend colleges and move on to high-earning jobs.\n\nIn the U.S., using median hourly earnings statistics (not controlling for job type differences), disparities in pay relative to white men are largest for Latina women (58% of white men's hourly earnings) and second-largest for Black women (65%), while white women have a pay gap of 82%. However, Asian women earn 87% as much as white men, making them the group of women with the smallest pay gap relative to white men.\n\nThe average woman is expected to earn $430,480 less than the average white man over a lifetime. Native American women can expect to earn $883,040 less, Black women earn $877,480 less, and Latina women earn $1,007,080 less over a lifetime. Asian American women's lifetime pay deficit is $365,440.\n\nAny given raw wage gap can be dissected into an \"explained\" part, due to differences in characteristics such as education, hours worked, work experience, and occupation, and/or an \"unexplained\" part, which is typically attributed to discrimination. This may be further explained when America takes into account that men are more likely to negotiate for higher pay. According to a study by Carnegie Mellon, when negotiating pay, 83% of men negotiated for a higher wage compared to the 58% of women who asked for more. Researchers say that women who do request either a raise or a higher starting salary are more likely than men to be penalized for those actions. Cornell University economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn stated that while the overall size of the wage gap has decreased somewhat over time, the proportion of the gap that is unexplained by human capital variables is increasing.\n\nUsing Current Population Survey (CPS) data for 1979 and 1995 and controlling for education, experience, personal characteristics, parental status, city and region, occupation, industry, government employment, and part-time status, Yale University economics professor Joseph G. Altonji and the United States Secretary of Commerce Rebecca M. Blank found that only about 27% of the gender wage gap in each year is explained by differences in such characteristics.\n\nA 1993 study of graduates of the University of Michigan Law School between 1972 and 1975 examined the gender wage gap while matching men and women for possible explanatory factors such as occupation, age, experience, education, time in the workforce, childcare, average hours worked, grades while in college, and other factors. After accounting for all that, women were paid 81.5% of what men \"with similar demographic characteristics, family situations, work hours, and work experience\" were paid.\n\nSimilarly, a comprehensive study by the staff of the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the gender wage gap can only be partially explained by human capital factors and \"work patterns.\" The GAO study, released in 2003, was based on data from 1983 through 2000 from a representative sample of Americans between the ages of 25 and 65. The researchers controlled for \"work patterns,\" including years of work experience, education, and hours of work per year, as well as differences in industry, occupation, race, marital status, and job tenure. With controls for these variables in place, the data showed that women earned, on average, 20% less than men during the entire period 1983 to 2000. In a subsequent study, GAO found that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor \"should better monitor their performance in enforcing anti-discrimination laws.\"\n\nUsing CPS data, U.S. Bureau of Labor economist Stephanie Boraas and College of William & Mary economics professor William R. Rodgers III report that only 39% of the gender pay gap is explained in 1999, controlling for percent female, schooling, experience, region, Metropolitan Statistical Area size, minority status, part-time employment, marital status, union, government employment, and industry.\n\nUsing data from longitudinal studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, researchers Judy Goldberg Dey and Catherine Hill analyzed some 9,000 college graduates from 1992–93 and more than 10,000 from 1999–2000. The researchers controlled for a multitude of variables, including: occupation, industry, hours worked per week, workplace flexibility, ability to telecommute, whether employee worked multiple jobs, months at employer, marital status, whether employee had children, and whether employee volunteered in the past year. The study found that wage inequities start early and worsen over time. \"The portion of the pay gap that remains unexplained after all other factors are taken into account is 5 percent one year after graduation and 12 percent 10 years after graduation. These unexplained gaps are evidence of discrimination, which remains a serious problem for women in the work force.\"\n\nIn a 1997 study, economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn took a set of human capital variables such as education, labor market experience, and race into account and additionally controlled for occupation, industry, and unionism. While the gender wage gap was considerably smaller when all variables were taken into account, a substantial portion of the pay gap (12%) remained unexplained.\n\nA study by John McDowell, Larry Singell and James Ziliak investigated faculty promotion on the economics profession and found that, controlling for quality of PhD training, publishing productivity, major field of specialization, current placement in a distinguished department, age and post-PhD experience, female economists were still significantly less likely to be promoted from assistant to associate and from associate to full professor—although there was also some evidence that women's promotion opportunities from associate to full professor improved in the 1980s.\n\nEconomist June O'Neill, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, found an unexplained pay gap of 8% after controlling for experience, education, and number of years on the job. Furthermore, O'Neill found that among young people who have never had a child, women's earnings approach 98 percent of men's.\n\nIn a stance rejecting discrimination, a 2009 study for the Department of Labour by the CONSAD Research Corporation concluded, \"it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men differently on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women.\" and continued \"In addition, at a practical level, the complex combination of factors that collectively determine the wages paid to different individuals makes the formulation of policy that will reliably redress any overt discrimination that does exist a task that is, at least, daunting and, more likely, unachievable. The conclusion was based largely on a study by Eric Solberg & Teresa Laughlin (1995), who found that \"occupational selection is the primary determinant of the gender wage gap\" (as opposed to discrimination) because \"any measure of earnings that excludes fringe benefits may produce misleading results as to the existence magnitude, consequence, and source of market discrimination.\" They found that the average wage rate of females was only 87.4% of the average wage rate of males; whereas, when earnings were measured by their index of total compensation (including fringe benefits), the average value of the index for females was 96.4% of the average value for males.\n\nA 2010 study by Catalyst, a nonprofit that works to expand opportunities for women in business, of male and female MBA graduates found that after controlling for career aspirations, parental status, years of experience, industry, and other variables, male graduates are more likely to be assigned jobs of higher rank and responsibility and earn, on average, $4,600 more than women in their first post-MBA jobs.This affects women's ability to pay off student loan debt since college isn't cheaper for a woman even though she can expect to make less after she earns a degree than her male peers. This results in women being in disproportionately more debt than men. This extra debt makes having less income even more debilitating as women have a harder time paying off student loan debt.\n\nA 2014 study found that the gender pay gap in the United States decreased in size significantly from 1970 to 2010, mainly because the unexplained portion of the gap decreased significantly during this period.\n\nIn 2018, economists at the University of Chicago and Stanford University, working with Uber analyzing the gender pay gap of Uber drivers demonstrated an average 7% pay gap in a context where gender discrimination was not possible and pay was not negotiated, showing the difference entirely explainable as the difference in average productivity between men and women as a result of driving styles (the average man drove faster), experience (the mean male had more experience driving with Uber than the mean female), and driver choices (men on average worked hours and locations with higher returns). The factors above explained 50%, 30%, and 20% of the variance respectively.\n\nA report in 2014 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working part-time. In the book \"Biology at Work: Rethinking Sexual Equality\", Browne writes: \"Because of the sex differences in hours worked, the hourly earnings gap [...] is a better indicator of the sexual disparity in earnings than the annual figure. Even the hourly earnings ratio does not completely capture the effects of sex differences in hours, however, because employees who work more hours also tend to earn more per hour.\"\n\nHowever, numerous studies indicate that variables such as hours worked account for only part of the gender pay gap and that the pay gap shrinks but does not disappear after controlling for all human capital variables known to affect pay. Moreover, Gary Becker argued in a 1985 article that the traditional division of labor in the family disadvantages women in the labor market as women devote substantially more time and effort to housework and have less time and effort available for performing market work. The OECD (2002) found that women work fewer hours because in the present circumstances the \"responsibilities for child-rearing and other unpaid household work are still unequally shared among partners.\"\n\nOccupational segregation refers to the way that some jobs (such as truck driver) are dominated by men, and other jobs (such as child care worker) are dominated by women. Considerable research suggests that predominantly female occupations pay less, even controlling for individual and workplace characteristics. Economists Blau and Kahn stated that women's pay compared to men's had improved because of a decrease in occupational segregation. They also argued that the gender wage difference will decline modestly and that the extent of discrimination against women in the labor market seems to be decreasing.\n\nIn 2008, a group of researchers examined occupational segregation and its implications for the salaries assigned to male- and female-typed jobs. They investigated whether participants would assign different pay to 3 types of jobs wherein the actual responsibilities and duties carried out by men and women were the same, but the job was situated in either a traditionally masculine or traditionally feminine domain. The researchers found statistically significant pay differentials between jobs defined as \"male\" and \"female,\" which suggest that gender-based discrimination, arising from occupational stereotyping and the devaluation of the work typically done by women, influences salary allocation. The results fit with contemporary theorizing about gender-based discrimination.\n\nA study showed that if a white woman in an all-male workplace moved to an all-female workplace, she would lose 7% of her wages. If a black woman did the same thing, she would lose 19% of her wages. Another study calculated that if female-dominated jobs did not pay lower wages, women's median hourly pay nationwide would go up 13.2% (men's pay would go up 1.1%, due to raises for men working in \"women's jobs\").\n\nNumerous studies indicate that the pay gap shrinks but does not disappear after controlling for occupation and a host of other human capital variables.\n\nIt has been suggested that women choose less-paying occupations because they provide flexibility to better manage work and family. Harvard economist Claudia Goldin has made this case in reviews of the literature in 2014 and 2016.\n\nA 2009 study of high school valedictorians in the U.S. found that female valedictorians were planning to have careers that had a median salary of $74,608, whereas male valedictorians were planning to have careers with a median salary of $97,734. As to why the females were less likely than the males to choose high paying careers such as surgeon and engineer, the New York Times article quoted the researcher as saying, \"The typical reason is that they are worried about combining family and career one day in the future.\"\n\nHowever, studies in 1990 by Jerry A. Jacobs and Ronnie Steinberg, as well as Jennifer Glass separately, found that male-dominated jobs actually have more flexibility and autonomy than female-dominated jobs, thus allowing a person, for example, to more easily leave work to tend to a sick child. Similarly, Heather Boushey stated that men actually have more access to workplace flexibility and that it is a \"myth that women choose less-paying occupations because they provide flexibility to better manage work and family.\"\n\nBased on data from the 1980s, economists Blau and Kahn and Wood et al. separately argue that \"free choice\" factors, while significant, have been shown in studies to leave large portions of the gender earnings gap unexplained.\n\nResearch suggests that gender stereotypes may be the driving force behind occupational segregation because they influence men and women's educational and career decisions.\n\nStudies by Michael Conway et al., David Wagner and Joseph Berger, John Williams and Deborah Best, and Susan Fiske et al. found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women at most things, as well as specific assumptions that men are better at some particular tasks (e.g., math, mechanical tasks) while women are better at others (e.g., nurturing tasks). Shelley Correll, Michael Lovaglia, Margaret Shih et al., and Claude Steele show that these gender status beliefs affect the assessments people make of their own competence at career-relevant tasks. Correll found that specific stereotypes (e.g., women have lower mathematical ability) affect women's and men's perceptions of their abilities (e.g., in math and science) such that men assess their own task ability higher than women performing at the same level. These \"biased self-assessments\" shape men and women's educational and career decisions.\n\nSimilarly, the OECD states that women's labour market behaviour \"is influenced by learned cultural and social values that may be thought to discriminate against women (and sometimes against men) by stereotyping certain work and life styles as 'male' or 'female'.\" Further, the OECD argues that women's educational choices \"may be dictated, at least in part, by their expectations that [certain] types of employment opportunities are not available to them, as well as by gender stereotypes that are prevalent in society.\"\n\nEconomist David Neumark argued that discrimination by employers tends to steer women into lower-paying occupations and men into higher-paying occupations.\n\nSeveral authors suggest that members of low-status groups are subject to negative stereotypes and attributes concerning their work-related competences. Similarly, studies suggest that members of high-status groups are more likely to receive favorable evaluations about their competence, normality, and legitimacy.\n\nDavid R. Hekman and colleagues found that men receive significantly higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.\n\nSimilarly, a study (2000) conducted by economic experts Claudia Goldin from Harvard University and Cecilia Rouse from Princeton University shows that when evaluators of applicants could see the applicant's gender they were more likely to select men. When the applicants gender could not be observed, the number of women hired significantly increased. David Neumark, a Professor of Economics at the University of California, Irvine, and colleagues (1996) found statistically significant evidence of sex discrimination against women in hiring. In an audit study, matched pairs of male and female pseudo-job seekers were given identical résumés and sent to apply for jobs as waiters and waitresses at the same set of restaurants. In high priced restaurants, a female applicant's probability of getting an interview was 35 percentage points lower than a male's and her probability of getting a job offer was 40 percentage points lower. Additional evidence suggests that customer biases in favor of men partly underlie the hiring discrimination. According to Neumark, these hiring patterns appear to have implications for sex differences in earnings, as informal survey evidence indicates that earnings are higher in high-price restaurants.\n\nOn the other hand, a 2007 study showed that for identical resumes fewer replies were sent to men compared with women (it also showed that women do worse when they have children, while men do worse when they don't). A 2015 study showed that women were preferred by a factor of 2 for academic roles in STEM subjects.\n\nIn 2006, the United States National Academy of Sciences found that women in science and engineering are hindered by bias and \"outmoded institutional structures\" in academia. The report \"Beyond Bias and Barriers\" says that extensive previous research showed a pattern of unconscious but pervasive bias, \"arbitrary and subjective\" evaluation processes and a work environment in which \"anyone lacking the work and family support traditionally provided by a 'wife' is at a serious disadvantage.\" Similarly, a 1999 report on faculty at MIT finds evidence of differential treatment of senior women and points out that it may encompass not simply differences in salary but also in space, awards, resources and responses to outside offers, \"with women receiving less despite professional accomplishments equal to those of their male colleagues.\"\n\nResearch finds that work by men is often subjectively seen as higher-quality than objectively equal or better work by women compared to how an actual scientific review panel measured scientific competence when deciding on research grants. The results showed that women scientists needed to be at least twice as accomplished as their male counterparts to receive equal credit and that among grant applicants men have statistically significant greater odds of receiving grants than equally qualified women.\n\nResearch on competence judgments has shown a pervasive tendency to devalue women's work and, in particular, prejudice against women in male-dominated roles which are presumably incongruent for women. Organizational research that investigates biases in perceptions of equivalent male and female competence has confirmed that women who enter high-status, male-dominated work settings often are evaluated more harshly and met with more hostility than equally qualified men. The \"think manager – think male\" phenomenon reflects gender stereotypes and status beliefs that associate greater status worthiness and competence with men than women. Gender status beliefs shape men's and women's assertiveness, the attention and evaluation their performances receive, and the ability attributed to them on the basis of performance. They also \"evoke a gender-differentiated double standard for attributing performance to ability, which differentially biases the way men and women assess their own competence at tasks that are career relevant, controlling for actual ability.\"\n\nAlice H. Eagly and Steven J. Karau (2002) argue that \"perceived incongruity between the female gender role and leadership roles leads to two forms of prejudice: (a) perceiving women less favorably than men as potential occupants of leadership roles and (b) evaluating behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a leader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman. One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles.\" Moreover, research suggests that when women are acknowledged to have been successful, they are less liked and more personally derogated than equivalently successful men. Assertive women who display masculine, agentic traits are viewed as violating prescriptions of feminine niceness and are penalized for violating the status order.\n\nHowever, a 2018 study analyzing the pay gap of Uber drivers showed the existence of a 7% gender disparity in hourly wages in a context where gender discrimination was impossible at the employer level (contracts and algorithms were gender blind) and where there was no evidence of discrimination at the rider level.\n\nThe economic risk and resulting costs of a woman possibly leaving jobs for a period of time or indefinitely to nurse a baby is cited by many to be a reason why women are less common in the higher paying occupations such as CEO positions and upper management. It is much easier for a man to be hired in these higher prestige jobs than to risk losing a female job holder. In a survey conducted of about 500 managers in the Slater &Gordon law firm, more than 40% of the managers agreed they generally hesitate to hire woman who fall in the age group of potentially bearing children or woman who already have children. Thomas Sowell argued in his 1984 book \"Civil Rights\" that most of pay gap is based on marital status, not a \"glass ceiling\" discrimination. Earnings for men and women of the same basic description (education, jobs, hours worked, marital status) were essentially equal. That result would not be predicted under explanatory theories of \"sexism\". However, it can be seen as a symptom of the unequal contributions made by each partner to child raising. Cathy Young cites men's and fathers' rights activists who contend that women do not allow men to take on paternal and domestic responsibilities. Many Western countries have some form of paternity leave to attempt to level the playing field in this regard. However, even in relatively gender-equal countries like Sweden, where parents are given 16 months of paid parental leave irrespective of gender, fathers take on average only 20% of the 16 months of paid parental and choose to transfer their days to their partner. In addition to maternity leave, Walter Block and Walter E. Williams have argued that marriage in and of itself, not maternity leave, in general will leave females with more household labor than the males. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that married women earn 75.5% as much as married men while women who have never married earn 94.2% of their unmarried male counterparts' earnings.\n\nOne study estimated that 10% of the convergence of the gender gap in the 1980s and 30% in the 1990s can be accounted for by the increasing availability of contraceptives.\n\nSeveral studies found a significant motherhood penalty on wages and evaluations of workplace performance and competence even after statistically controlling for education, work experience, race, whether an individual works full- or part-time, and a broad range of other human capital and occupational variables. The OECD confirmed the existing literature, in which \"a significant impact of children on women's pay is generally found in the United Kingdom and the United States.\" However, one study found a wage premium for women with very young children.\n\nStanford University professor Shelley Correll and colleagues (2007) sent out more than 1,200 fictitious résumés to employers in a large Northeastern city, and found that female applicants with children were significantly less likely to get hired and if hired would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children. This despite the fact that the qualification, workplace performances and other relevant characteristics of the fictitious job applicants were held constant and only their parental status varied. Mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers. The researchers review results from other studies and argue that the motherhood role exists in tension with the cultural understandings of the \"ideal worker\" role and this leads evaluators to expect mothers to be less competent and less committed to their job. Fathers do not experience these types of workplace disadvantages as understandings of what it means to be a good father are not seen as incompatible with understandings of what it means to be a good worker.\n\nSimilarly, Fuegen et al. found that when evaluators rated fictitious applicants for an attorney position, female applicants with children were held to a higher standard than female applicants without children. Fathers were actually held to a significantly lower standard than male non-parents. Cuddy, Fiske, and Glick show that describing a consultant as a mother leads evaluators to rate her as less competent than when she is described as not having children.\n\nResearch has also shown there to be a \"marriage premium\" for men with labor economists frequently reporting that married men earn higher wages than unmarried men, and speculating that this may be attributable to one or more of the following causes: (1) more productive men marry at greater rates (attributing the marriage premium to selection bias), (2) men become more productive following marriage (due to labor market specialization by men and domestic specialization by women), or (3) employers favor married men. Lincoln (2008) found no support for the specialization hypothesis among full-time employed workers. Some studies have suggested this premium is greater for men with children while others have shown fatherhood to have no effect on wages one way or the other.\n\nAccording to Serge Desmarais and James Curtis, the \"gender gap in pay …is related to gender differences in perceptions of pay entitlement.\" Similarly, Major et al. argue that gender differences in pay expectations play a role in perpetuating non-performance related pay differences between women and men.\n\nPerceptions of wage entitlement differ between women and men such that men are more likely to feel worthy of higher pay while women's sense of wage entitlement is depressed. Women's beliefs about their relatively lower worth and their depressed wage entitlement reflects their lower social status such that when women's status is raised, their wage entitlement raises as well. However, gender-related status manipulation has no impact on men's elevated wage entitlement. Even when men's status is lowered on a specific task (e.g., by telling them that women typically outperform men on this task), men do not reduce their self-pay and respond with elevated projections of their own competence. The usual pattern whereby men assign themselves more pay than women for comparable work might explain why men tend to initiate negotiations more than women.\n\nIn a study by psychologist Melissa Williams et al., published in 2010, study participants were given pairs of male and female first names, and asked to estimate their salaries. Men and to a lesser degree women estimated significantly higher salaries for men than women, replicating previous findings. In a subsequent study, participants were placed in the role of employer and were asked to judge what newly hired men and women deserve to earn. The researchers found that men and to a lesser extent women assign higher salaries to men than women based on automatic stereotypic associations. The researchers argue that observations of men as higher earners than women has led to a stereotype that associates men (more than women) with wealth, and that this stereotype itself may serve to perpetuate the wage gap at both conscious and nonconscious levels. For example, a male-wealth stereotype may influence an employer's initial salary offer to a male job candidate, or a female college graduate's intuitive sense about what salary she can appropriately ask for at her first job.\n\nSome studies of simulated salary negotiations have found that men on average negotiated more aggressively than women. Other studies, however, have found no gender difference in pay negotiations. A 1991 study investigating the salary negotiating behaviors and starting salary outcomes of graduating MBA students and found that women did not negotiate less than men, but women did obtain lower monetary returns from negotiation—which could have large impacts over the course of a career.\n\nSituational factors which are assumed to influence salary negotiation include:\n\nSmall et al. suggest that \"framing situations as opportunities for negotiation is particularly intimidating to women, as this language is inconsistent with norms for politeness among low-power individuals, such as women\". Their study of pay negotiations found that women were less likely than men to negotiate when the behavior was labeled as \"negotiating\" but equally likely when the behavior was labeled as \"asking\".\n\nRiley and Babcock found that women are penalized when they try to negotiate starting salaries. Male evaluators tended to rule against women who negotiated but were less likely to penalize men; female evaluators tended to penalize both men and women who negotiated, and preferred applicants who did not ask for more. The study also showed that women who applied for jobs were not as likely to be hired by male managers if they tried to ask for more money, while men who asked for a higher salary were not negatively affected.\n\nHowever, a 2018 study analyzing the pay gap of Uber drivers showed that men earned 7% more than women in a context where salaries were not negotiated.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics investigated job traits that are associated with wage premiums, and stated: \"The duties most highly valued by the marketplace are generally cognitive or supervisory in nature. Job attributes relating to interpersonal relationships do not seem to affect wages, nor do the attributes of physically demanding or dangerous jobs.\" Economists Peter Dorman and Paul Hagstrom (1998) state that \"The theoretical case for wage compensation for risk is plausible but hardly certain. If workers have utility functions in which the expected likelihood and cost of occupational hazards enter as arguments, if they are fully informed of risks, if firms possess sufficient information on worker expectations and preferences (directly or through revealed preferences), if safety is costly to provide and not a public good, and if risk is fully transacted in anonymous, perfectly competitive labor markets, then workers will receive wage premia that exactly offset the disutility of assuming greater risk of injury or death. Of course, none of these assumptions applies in full and if one or more of them is sufficiently at variance with the real world, actual compensation may be less than utility-offsetting, nonexistent, or even negative – a combination of low pay and poor working conditions.\"\n\nAn October 2012 study by the American Association of University Women found that over the course of a 35-year career, an American woman with a college degree will make about $1.2 million less than a man with the same education. Therefore, closing the pay gap by raising women's wages would have a stimulus effect that would grow the U.S. economy by at least 3% to 4%. Women currently make up 70 percent of Medicaid recipients and 80 percent of welfare recipients. Increasing women's workplace participation from its present rate of 76% to 84%, as it is in Sweden, the U.S. could add 5.1 million women to the workforce, again, 3% to 4% of the size of the U.S. economy.\n\nAccording to a report by the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee, the gender pay gap jeopardizes women's retirement security. Of the multiple sources of income Americans rely on later in life, many are directly linked to a worker's earnings over his or her career. These include Social Security benefits, based on lifetime earnings, and defined benefit pension distributions that are typically calculated using a formula based on a worker's tenure and salary during peak-earnings years. The persistent gender pay gap leaves women with less income from these sources than men. For example, older women's Social Security benefits are 71% of older men's benefits ($11,057 for women versus $15,557 for men in 2009). Incomes from public and private pensions based on women's own work were just 60% and 48% of men's pension incomes, respectively.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This law extended the statute of limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman at the end of her career found that she had been making less money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.\n\nTo help raise awareness on the pay gap, a pop-up store named \"76 is Less Than 100\" operated during the month of April 2015 in the Garfield neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The nonprofit store, which sells arts and crafts designed by women, charges men full price while women get a 24% discount to reflect the pay gap between men and women in Pennsylvania. The store made national headlines in the wake of Patricia Arquette referencing the pay gap at the 87th Academy Awards two months before. In November 2015 the operators opened a second iteration in New Orleans, titled \"66<100\" to reflect the pay gap in Louisiana.\n\nSheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, is a strong advocate of closing the gender pay gap. In her book, \"Lean In\", she urges professional women to \"lean in\" to their careers, negotiate for higher salaries to decrease the pay gap, and to find supportive partners who will actively help raise children to help lessen the motherhood penalty. She is also the founder of LeanIn.Org, which has run national social media campaigns using the hashtags #BanBossy and #LeanInTogether.\n\nOscar-winning American actress Jennifer Lawrence has also brought international attention to the gender pay gap with an essay in fellow pay gap advocate Lena Dunham's \"Lenny Letter.\" In her essay, she addresses the fact that she was paid less than her \"American Hustle\" co-stars, which was made public by the Sony hacking scandal. She largely blamed herself for having \"failed as a negotiator\" and being focused on being liked. The essay highlighted that the gender pay gap exists for every industry and all across Hollywood.\n\nHowever, these public reactions have been criticized for embodying white feminism because they do not take into account intersectionality and the increased obstacles that women of color face. Intersectional feminists often find that white feminists attempt to speak for all women when relaying their experiences of the gender pay gap, when in reality their problems are not relatable to women of color who face an additional barrier of racism.\n\n\nLegislation:\n\n"}

The monastery was therefore also known as \"Säby\", or \"Saba\" in Latin. It continued to receive rich donations from King Erik Knutsson (1210-1216), and later from other members of the aristocracy and royal circles. It was finally the owner of some 80 farms, mostly in Södermanland. At the time of the Protestant Reformation, King Gustavus Vasa appropriated the abbey in accordance with the Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden and gave it in fief to Olof Arvidsson, a bailiff in Nyköping, in 1527.

Both were abolished after protests, in 2000 and 2006 respectively.\n\nThe system of bonded labour existed in Nepal since the 18th century; following the unification of Nepal, members of the ruling elite received land grants in the Terai and were entitled to collect revenue from those who cultivated the land.\n\nThe Kamaiya system bonds males to labour, and the Kamlari system bonds females.\n\nTraditionally, people without land or work could get loans from landowners allowing them to sustain a minimum livelihood. In exchange to this, they had to live and work on the landowner's land as quasi slaves. Exorbitant debts were charged, and whole families were forced to slave labour for years and even generations, bonded by indebtedness to the landowner and bonded by unequal social relations to sell labour in lieu of the loan taken.\n\nFollowing the eradication of malaria in the Terai region in the 1950-60s, the large influx of hill migrants marginalized traditionally landowning Tharu people by occupying their lands. While the Tharus had no records of the land they were cultivating, the settlers registered the land in their name, forcing the Tharus to work as agricultural labourers. The customary practice of obtaining a \"helping hand for family business\" was gradually replaced by the forced labour system called Kamaiya, which in Tharu parlance is tantamount to hardworking hired farm labour.\nThe Kamaiya system existed in particular in western Nepal and affects especially the Tharu people and Dalits.\n\nIncreasing protests against the kamaiya system, organized by the \"Kamaiya movement\", led to its abolition in 2000. On 17 July that year, the Government of Nepal announced the Kamaiya system be banned, all Kamaiyas be freed and their debts be cancelled. Although most Kamaiya families were freed, the system has persisted. Many Kamaiyas were evicted by their former landlords and released into poverty without any support. Others received land that was unproductive.\n\nTo alleviate the poverty of the affected people – the main cause of the system – rehabilitation and distribution of land were promised to ex-Kamaiya families. To put action behind the attempts to discuss the land issue with the government, the ex-Kamaiyas started occupying land in Kailali and Bardiya districts in the winter of 2005-06. But a decade after being liberated, the freed Kamaiyas are forced to live a very difficult life as the government has still not fulfilled its promises of providing a proper rehabilitation and relief package.\n\nIn its modern form, girls and young women are sold by their parents into indentured servitude under contract for periods of one year with richer, higher-caste buyers, generally from outside their villages. \n\nSeveral activist groups including the Nepal Youth Foundation (NYF) and the Friends of Needy Children (FNC) have campaigned for abolition of the system since 2000, and worked to free kamlaris by paying off their parents' debts. On 10 September 2006, the Supreme Court of Nepal affirmed that this practice known as kamlari was illegal, and that former kamlaris were entitled to governmental compensation, education and rehabilitation. However, the interim-government of Nepal (formed during the last stage of the Nepalese Civil War following the successful April 2006 revolution against the autocratic monarchy) failed to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling, and the practice continued to exist.\n\nAnti-kamlari organisations launched new campaigns and protests to demand the government to comply, which in 2009 resulted in financial compensation for freed kamlaris. The system was still not abolished, however, and thousands of girls served forcefully for several more years. Various charitable organizations have mitigated the \"kamlari\" practice by offering grants larger than prospective masters to families who promise not to sell their daughters, as well as funds for the girls' education.\n\nThe next year the Freed Kamlari Development Forum (FKDF) was formed by former slave girls with the help of NYF and FNC. The suspicious death 12-year-old kamlari Srijana Chaudhary in March 2013 revived the movement and saw mass protests taking place to demand the practice's immediate end. After images of police hitting the protesting girls were seen in national and international media, outrage against the Nepalese government soared. In June 2013, the government finally gave in and officially abolished the kamlari system and agreed to a 10 point plan involving compensation, rehabilitation and justice for victims of abuse.\n\nDespite the 2013 official prohibition on putting girls into indentured servitude, the NYF estimated in October 2017 that hundreds of girls were still living in slave-like conditions, many in the homes of prominent politicians and businessmen.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6006557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6006557", "title": "Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)", "text": "Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)\n\nThe Kingdom of Italy (Latin: \"Regnum Italiae\" or \"Regnum Italicum\", Italian: \"Regno d'Italia\") was one of the constituent kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire, along with the kingdoms of Germany, Bohemia, and Burgundy. It comprised northern and central Italy, but excluded the Republic of Venice. Its original capital was Pavia until the 11th century.\n\nIn 773, Charlemagne, the King of the Franks, crossed the Alps to invade the Kingdom of the Lombards, which encompassed all of Italy except the Duchy of Rome and some Byzantine possessions in the south. In June 774, the kingdom collapsed and the Franks became masters of northern Italy. The southern areas remained under Lombard control as the Duchy of Benevento is changed into the rather independent Principality of Benevento. Charlemagne adopted the title \"King of the Lombards\" and in 800 was crowned \"Emperor of the Romans\" in Rome. Members of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule Italy until the deposition of Charles the Fat in 887, after which they once briefly regained the throne in 894–896. Until 961, the rule of Italy was continually contested by several aristocratic families from both within and outside the kingdom.\n\nIn 961, King Otto I of Germany, already married to Adelaide, widow of a previous king of Italy, invaded the kingdom and had himself crowned in Pavia on 25 December. He continued on to Rome, where he had himself crowned emperor on 7 February 962. The union of the crowns of Italy and Germany with that of the so-called \"Empire of the Romans\" proved stable. Burgundy was added to this union in 1032, and by the twelfth century the term \"Holy Roman Empire\" had come into use to describe it. From 961 on, the Emperor of the Romans was usually also King of Italy and Germany, although emperors sometimes appointed their heirs to rule in Italy and occasionally the Italian bishops and noblemen elected a king of their own in opposition to that of Germany. The absenteeism of the Italian monarch led to the rapid disappearance of a central government in the High Middle Ages, but the idea that Italy was a kingdom within the Empire remained and emperors frequently sought to impose their will on the evolving Italian city-states. The resulting wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines, the anti-imperialist and imperialist factions, respectively, were characteristic of Italian politics in the 12th–14th centuries. The Lombard League was the most famous example of this situation; though not a declared separatist movement, it openly challenged the emperor's claim to power.\n\nBy the 15th century, the power of the city-states was largely broken. A series of wars in Lombardy from 1423 to 1454 further reduced the number of competing states in Italy. The next forty years were relatively peaceful in Italy, but in 1494 the peninsula was invaded by France. The resulting Great Italian Wars lasted until 1559 as control of most of the Italian states passed to King Philip II of Spain. The Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. But the Spanish branch of the Habsburg dynasty—the same dynasty of which another branch provided the Emperors—continued to rule most of Italy down to the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714). After the Imperial Reform of 1495–1512, the Italian kingdom corresponded to the unencircled territories south of the Alps. Juridically the emperor maintained an interest in them as nominal king and overlord, but the \"government\" of the kingdom consisted of little more than the plenipotentiaries the emperor appointed to represent him and those governors he appointed to rule his own Italian states. The Habsburg rule in Italy came to an end with the campaigns of the French Revolutionaries in 1792–1797, when a series of client republics were set up. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by the last emperor, Francis II, after its defeat by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz.\n\nAfter the Battle of Taginae, in which the Ostrogoth king Totila was killed, the Byzantine general Narses captured Rome and besieged Cumae. Teia, the new Ostrogothic king, gathered the remnants of the Ostrogothic army and marched to relieve the siege, but in October 552 Narses ambushed him at \"Mons Lactarius\" (modern Monti Lattari) in Campania, near Mount Vesuvius and Nuceria Alfaterna. The battle lasted two days and Teia was killed in the fighting. Ostrogothic power in Italy was eliminated, but according to Roman historian Procopius of Caesarea, Narses allowed the Ostrogothic population and their Rugian allies to live peacefully in Italy under Roman sovereignty. The absence of any real authority in Italy immediately after the battle led to an invasion by the Franks and Alemanni, but they too were defeated in the battle of the Volturnus and the peninsula was, for a short time, reintegrated into the empire.\n\nThe Kings of the Lombards (, singular \"\") ruled that Germanic people from their invasion of Italy in 567–68 until the Lombardic identity became lost in the ninth and tenth centuries. After 568, the Lombard kings sometimes styled themselves Kings of Italy (). Upon the Lombard defeat at the 774 Siege of Pavia, the kingdom came under the Frankish domination of Charlemagne. The Iron Crown of Lombardy (\"Corona Ferrea\") was used for the coronation of the Lombard kings, and the kings of Italy thereafter, for centuries.\n\nThe primary sources for the Lombard kings before the Frankish conquest are the anonymous 7th-century \"Origo Gentis Langobardorum\" and the 8th-century \"Historia Langobardorum\" of Paul the Deacon. The earliest kings (the pre-Lethings) listed in the \"Origo\" are almost certainly legendary. They purportedly reigned during the Migration Period; the first ruler attested independently of Lombard tradition is Tato.\n\nThe actual control of the sovereigns of both the major areas that constitute the kingdom – \"Langobardia Major\" in the centre-north (in turn divided into a western, or Neustria, and one eastern, or Austria and Tuskia) and \"Langobardia Minor\" in the centre-south, was not constant during the two centuries of life of the kingdom. An initial phase of strong autonomy of the many constituent duchies developed over time with growing regal authority, even if the dukes' desires for autonomy were never fully achieved.\n\nThe Lombard kingdom proved to be more stable than its Ostrogothic predecessor, but in 774, on the pretext of defending the Papacy, it was conquered by the Franks under Charlemagne. They kept the Italo-Lombard realm separate from their own, but the kingdom shared in all the partitions, divisions, civil wars, and succession crises of the Carolingian Empire of which it became a part until, by the end of the ninth century, the Italian kingdom was an independent, but highly decentralised, state.\n\nThe death of the Emperor Lothair I in 855 led to his realm of Middle Francia being split among his three sons. The eldest, Louis II, inherited the Carolingian lands in Italy, which were now for the first time (save the brief rule of Charlemagne's son Pepin in the first decade of the century), ruled as a distinct unit. The kingdom included all of Italy as far south as Rome and Spoleto, but the rest of Italy to the south was under the rule of the Lombard Principality of Benevento or of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nFollowing Louis II's death without heirs, there were several decades of confusion. The Imperial crown was initially disputed among the Carolingian rulers of West Francia (France) and East Francia (Germany), with first the western king (Charles the Bald) and then the eastern (Charles the Fat) attaining the prize. Following the deposition of the latter, local nobles – Guy III of Spoleto and Berengar of Friuli – disputed over the crown, and outside intervention did not cease, with Arnulf of Eastern Francia and Louis the Blind of Provence both claiming the Imperial throne for a time. The kingdom was also beset by Arab raiding parties from Sicily and North Africa, and central authority was minimal at best.\n\nIn the 10th century, the situation hardly improved, as various Burgundian and local noblemen continued to dispute over the crown. Order was only imposed from outside, when the German king Otto I invaded Italy and seized both the Imperial and Italian thrones for himself in 962.\n\nIn 951 King Otto I of Germany had married Adelaide of Burgundy, the widow of late King Lothair II of Italy. Otto assumed the Iron Crown of Lombardy at Pavia despite his rival Margrave Berengar of Ivrea. When in 960 Berengar attacked the Papal States, King Otto, summoned by Pope John XII, conquered the Italian kingdom and on 2 February 962 had himself crowned Holy Roman Emperor at Rome. From that time on, the Kings of Italy were always also Kings of Germany, and Italy thus became a constituent kingdom of the Holy Roman Empire, along with the Kingdom of Germany (\"regnum Teutonicorum\") and – from 1032 – Burgundy. The German king (\"Rex Romanorum\") would be crowned by the Archbishop of Milan with the Iron Crown in Pavia as a prelude to the visit to Rome to be crowned Emperor by the Pope.\n\nIn general, the monarch was an absentee, spending most of his time in Germany and leaving the Kingdom of Italy with little central authority. There was also a lack of powerful landed magnates – the only notable one being the Margraviate of Tuscany, which had wide lands in Tuscany, Lombardy, and the Emilia, but which failed due to lack of heirs after the death of Matilda of Canossa in 1115. This left a power vacuum – increasingly filled by the Papacy and by the bishops, as well as by the increasingly wealthy Italian cities, which gradually came to dominate the surrounding countryside. Upon the death of Emperor Otto III in 1002, one of late Berengar's successors, Margrave Arduin of Ivrea, even succeeded in assuming the Italian crown and in defeating the Imperial forces under Duke Otto I of Carinthia. Not until 1004 could the new German King Henry II of Germany, by the aid of Bishop Leo of Vercelli, move into Italy to have himself crowned \"rex Italiae\". Arduin ranks as the last domestic \"King of Italy\" before the accession of Victor Emmanuel II in 1861.\n\nHenry's Salian successor Conrad II tried to confirm his dominion against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and other Italian aristocrats (\"seniores\"). While besieging Milan in 1037, he issued the \"Constitutio de feudis\" in order to secure the support of the \"vasvassores\" petty gentry, whose fiefs he declared hereditary. Indeed, Conrad could stable his rule, however, the Imperial supremacy in Italy remained contested.\n\nThe cities first demonstrated their increasing power during the reign of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (1152–1190), whose attempts to restore imperial authority in the peninsula led to a series of wars with the Lombard League, a league of northern Italian cities, and ultimately to a decisive victory for the League at the Battle of Legnano in 1176, which forced Frederick to recognize the autonomy of the Italian cities.\n\nFrederick's son Henry VI actually managed to extend Hohenstaufen authority in Italy by his conquest of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, which comprised Sicily and all of Southern Italy. Henry's son, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor – the first emperor since the 10th century to actually base himself in Italy – attempted to return to his father's task of restoring imperial authority in the northern Italian Kingdom, which led to fierce opposition not only from a reformed Lombard League, but also from the Popes, who had become increasingly jealous of their temporal realm in central Italy (theoretically a part of the Empire), and concerned about the hegemonic ambitions of the Hohenstaufen emperors.\n\nFrederick II's efforts to bring all of Italy under his control failed as signally as those of his grandfather, and his death in 1250 marked the effective end of the Kingdom of Italy as a genuine political unit. Conflict continued between Ghibellines (Imperial supporters) and Guelfs (Papal supporters) in the Italian cities, but these conflicts bore less and less relation to the origins of the parties in question.\n\nThe Italian campaigns of the Holy Roman Emperors decreased, but the Kingdom did not become wholly meaningless. In 1310 the Luxembourg King Henry VII of Germany with 5,000 men again crossed the Alps, moved into Milan and had himself crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, sparking a Guelph rebellion under Lord Guido della Torre. Henry restored the rule of Matteo I Visconti and proceeded to Rome, where he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by three cardinals in place of Pope Clement V in 1312. His further plans to restore the Imperial rule and to invade the Kingdom of Naples were aborted by his sudden death the next year.\n\nSuccessive emperors in the 14th and 15th centuries were bound in the struggle between the rivaling Luxembourg, Habsburg and Wittelsbach dynasties. In the conflict with Frederick the Fair, King Louis IV (reigned until 1347) had himself crowned Emperor in Rome by Antipope Nicholas V in 1328. His successor Charles IV also returned to Rome to be crowned in 1355. None of the Emperors forgot their theoretical claims to dominion as Kings of Italy. Nor did the Italians themselves forget the claims of the Emperors to universal dominion: writers like Dante Alighieri (died 1321) and Marsilius of Padua (c. 1275 – c. 1342) expressed their commitment both to the principle of universal monarchy, and to the actual pretensions of Emperors Henry VII and Louis IV, respectively.\n\nThe Imperial claims to dominion in Italy mostly manifested themselves, however, in the granting of titles to the various strongmen who had begun to establish their control over the formerly republican cities. Most notably, the Emperors gave their backing to the Visconti of Milan, and King Wenceslaus created Gian Galeazzo Visconti Duke of Milan in 1395. Other families to receive new titles from the emperors included the Gonzaga of Mantua, and the Este of Ferrara and Modena.\n\nBy the beginning of the early modern period, the Kingdom of Italy still existed but was a mere shadow. Its territory had been significantly limited – the conquests of the Republic of Venice, which considered itself independent of the Empire, in the \"domini di Terraferma\" had taken most of northeastern Italy outside the jurisdiction of the Empire, while the Popes claimed full sovereignty and independence in the Papal States in Central Italy. Nevertheless, the Emperor Charles V, owing more to his inheritance of Spain and Naples than to his position as Emperor, was able to establish his dominance in Italy to a greater extent than any Emperor since Frederick II. He drove the French from Milan, prevented an attempt by the Italian princes, with French aid, to reassert their independence in the League of Cognac, sacked Rome and brought the Medici pope Clement VII to submission, conquered Florence where he reinstalled the Medici as Dukes of Florence (and later, Grand Dukes of Tuscany), and, upon the extinction of the Sforza line in Milan, claimed the territory as an imperial fief and installed his son Philip as the new Duke.\n\nThis new Imperial dominance, however, did not remain with the Empire, in which Charles was succeeded by his brother Ferdinand, but rather was transferred by Charles to his son, who became King of Spain.\n\nNevertheless, the Imperial claims to suzerainty remained, and were actually called forth in the early 17th century when the Duchy of Mantua fell vacant in 1627. Emperor Ferdinand II used his rights as feudal overlord to prevent the heir, the French Duke of Nevers, from taking over the Duchy, leading to the War of the Mantuan Succession, a part of the much larger Thirty Years' War. In the early 18th century, during the War of the Spanish Succession, imperial claims to suzerainty were used again to seize Mantua in 1708, which was now attached by the Austrian Habsburgs to the newly conquered Duchy of Milan.\n\nThis was the last notable usage of Imperial power, as such, in Italy. The Austrians retained control of Milan and Mantua, and intermittently, other territories (notably Tuscany after 1737), but the claims to feudal overlordship had become practically meaningless. The imperial claims to Italy remained only in the secondary title of the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne to be \"Arch-Chancellor of Italy\" and in the formal adherence of Emperor and Diet to various treaties resolving the succession of various northern Italian states which were still considered to be imperial fiefs. During the French Revolutionary Wars, the Austrians were driven from Italy by Napoleon, who set up republics throughout northern Italy, and by the Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797, Emperor Francis II relinquished any claims over the territories that made up the Kingdom of Italy. The imperial reorganization carried out in 1799–1803 left no room for Imperial claims to Italy – even the Archbishop of Cologne was gone, secularized along with the other ecclesiastical princes. In 1805, while the Empire was still in existence, Napoleon, by now Emperor Napoleon I, claimed the crown of Italy for himself, putting the Iron Crown on his head at Milan on 26 May 1805. The Empire itself was abolished the next year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1809220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1809220", "title": "Reddy", "text": "Reddy\n\nReddy (also transliterated as \"Raddi\", \"Reddi\", \"Reddiar\", \"Reddappa\", \"Reddy\") is a caste that originated in India, predominantly settled in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They are classified as a forward caste.\n\nThe origin of the Reddy has been linked to the Rashtrakutas, although opinions vary. At one time they were a warrior caste and later became feudal overlords and peasant proprietors. Historically they have been the land-owning aristocracy of the villages. Traditionally, they were a diverse community of merchants and cultivators. Their prowess as rulers and warriors is well documented in Telugu history. The Reddy dynasty (1325–1448 CE) ruled coastal and central Andhra for over a hundred years.\n\nAccording to Alain Daniélou and Kenneth Hurry, the Rashtrakuta and Reddy dynasties may both have been descended from the earlier dynasty of the Rashtrikas. This common origin is by no means certain: there is evidence suggesting that the Rashtrakuta line came from the Yadavas in northern India and also that they may simply have held a common title. Either of these alternate theories might undermine the claim to a connection between them and the Reddys.\n\nThe varna designation of Reddys is a contested and complex topic. Even after the introduction of the varna concept to south India, caste boundaries in south India were not as marked as in north India, where the four-tier varna system placed the priestly Brahmins on top followed by the Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. In south India, on the other hand, there existed only three distinguishable classes, the Brahmins, the non-Brahmins and the Dalits. The two intermediate dvija varnas — the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas — did not exist.\n\nThe dominant castes of south India, such as Reddys and Nairs, held a status in society analogous to the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas of the north with the difference that religion did not sanctify them, i.e. they were not accorded the status of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas by the Brahmins in the Brahmanical varna system. Historically, land-owning castes like the Reddys have belonged to the regal ruling classes and are analogous to the Kshatriyas of the Brahmanical society.\n\nThe Brahmins, on top of the hierarchical social order, viewed the ruling castes of the south like the Reddys, Nairs and Vellalars as sat-Shudras meaning shudras of \"true being”. Sat-shudras are also known as clean shudras, upper shudras, pure or high-caste shudras. This classification and the four-tier varna concept was never accepted by the ruling castes.\n\nDuring the Kakatiya period, \"Reddi\", together with its variant \"Raddi\", was used as a status title (\"gaurava-vachakamu\"). The title broadly represented the category of village headmen irrespective of their hereditary background.\n\nThe Kakatiya prince Prola I (c. 1052 to 1076) was referred to as \"Prola Reddi\" in an inscription. After the Kakatiyas became independent rulers in their own right, various subordinate chiefs under their rule are known to have used the title Reddi. Reddy chiefs were appointed as generals and soldiers under the Kakatiyas. Some Reddys were among the feudatories of Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra. During this time, some of the Reddys carved out feudal principalities for themselves. Prominent among them were the Munagala Reddy chiefs. Two inscriptions found in the Zamindari of Munagala at Tadavayi, two miles west of Munagala—one dated 1300 CE, and the other dated 1306 CE show that the Munagala Reddy chiefs were feudatories to the Kakatiya dynasty. The inscriptions proclaim Annaya Reddy of Munagala as a chieftain of Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra.\n\nThe Reddy feudatories fought against attacks from the Delhi sultanate and defended the region from coming under the Turkic rule. Eventually, the Sultanate invaded Warangal and captured Pratapa Rudra in 1323.\n\nAfter the death of Pratapa Rudra in 1323 CE and the subsequent fall of the Kakatiya empire, some Reddy chiefs became independent rulers. Prolaya Vema Reddy proclaimed independence, establishing a \"Reddy dynasty\" based in Addanki, . He had been part of a coalition of Telugu rulers who overthrew the \"foreign\" ruler (Turkic rulers of the Delhi Sultanate).\n\nThe Reddy dynasty (1325–1448 CE) ruled coastal and central Andhra for over a hundred years.\n\nThe post-Kakatiya period saw the emergence of Vijayanagara Empire as well as the Reddy dynasty. Initially, the two kingdoms were locked up in a territorial struggle for supremacy in the coastal region of Andhra. Later, they united and became allies against their common archrivals—the Bahmani sultans and the Recherla Velamas of Rachakonda who had formed an alliance. This political alliance between Vijayanagara and the Reddy kingdom was cemented further by a matrimonial alliance. Harihara II of Vijayanagara gave his daughter in marriage to Kataya Vema Reddy’s son Kataya. The Reddy rulers exercised a policy of annexation and invasion of Kalinga (modern day Odisha). However, the suzerainty of Kalinga rulers was to be recognised. In 1443 CE, determined to put an end to the aggressions of the Reddy kingdom, the Gajapati ruler Kapilendra of Kalinga formed an alliance with the Velamas and launched an attack on the Reddy kingdom. Veerabhadra Reddy allied himself with Vijayanagara ruler Devaraya II and defeated Kapilendra. After the death of Devaraya II in 1446 CE, he was succeeded by his son, Mallikarjuna Raya. Overwhelmed by difficulties at home, Mallikarjuna Raya recalled the Vijayanagara forces from Rajahmundry. Veerabhadra Reddy died in 1448 CE. Seizing this opportunity, Kapilendra sent an army under the leadership of his son Hamvira into the Reddy kingdom, took Rajahmundry and gained control of the Reddy kingdom. The Gajapatis eventually lost control after the death of Kapilendra, and the territories of the former Reddy kingdom came under the control of the Vijayanagara Empire.\n\nLater, Reddys became the military chieftains of the Vijayanagara rulers. They along with their private armies accompanied and supported the Vijayanagara army in the conquest of new territories. These chieftains were known by the title of Poligars. The Reddy poligars were appointed to render military services in times of war, collect revenue from the populace and pay to the royal treasury. The chieftains exercised considerable autonomy in their respective provinces. The ancestors of the legendary Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy – who led an armed rebellion against the British East India company, were poligars. Reddys were historically dominant in the Rayalaseema region.\n\nOnce independent, the erstwhile chiefs of the Vijayanagara empire indulged in several internal squabbles for supremacy in their areas. This constant warring between powerful feudal warlords for fiefdoms and power manifests itself even in modern-day Rayalaseema in the form of a brutally violent phenomenon termed as “factionalism”, “factional violence” or simply “faction”.\n\nDuring this period, Reddys ruled several \"samsthanams\" (tributary estates) in the Telangana area. They ruled as vassals of Golkonda sultans. Prominent among them were Ramakrishna Reddy, Pedda Venkata Reddy and Immadi Venkata Reddy. In the 16th century, the Pangal fort situated in Mahbubnagar district of Andhra Pradesh was ruled by Veera Krishna Reddy. Immadi Venkata Reddy was recognised by the Golkonda sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah as a regular provider of military forces to the Golkonda armies. The Gadwal samsthanam situated in Mahbubnagar includes a fort built in 1710 CE by Raja Somtadari. Reddys continued to be chieftains, village policemen and tax collectors in the Telangana region, throughout the Golkonda rule.\n\nOne of most prominent figures from the community during the British period is Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy. He challenged the British and led an armed rebellion against the British East India company in 1846. He was finally captured and hanged in 1847. His uprising was one of the earlier rebellions against the British rule in India, as it was 10 years before the famous Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nReddys were the landed gentry known as the deshmukhs and part of the Nizam of Hyderabad's administration. The Reddy landlords styled themselves as \"Desais\", \"Doras\" and \"Patel\". Several Reddys were noblemen in the court of Nizam Nawabs and held many high positions in the Nizam's administrative set up. Raja Bahadur Venkatarama Reddy was made Kotwal of Hyderabad in 1920 CE during the reign of the seventh Nizam Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII. Raja Bahadur Venkatarama Reddy was the first Hindu to be made kotwal of Hyderabad as in the late 19th and early 20th century, during the Islamic rule of the Nizams, the powerful position of Kotwal was held only by Muslims. His tenure lasted almost 14 years and he commanded great respect among the public for his outstanding police administration.\n\nSeveral Reddys were at the forefront of the anti-Nizam movement. In 1941, communist leaders Raavi Narayana Reddy and Baddam Yella Reddy transformed the Andhra Mahasabha into an anti-Nizam united mass militant organisation and led an armed struggle against the Nizam's regime.\n\nSome of the prominent Reddy zamindaris/samsthanams:\n\n\nKammas and Reddys are politically dominant castes prior to the formation of Andhra Pradesh in 1956 and after. Reddys are classified as a Forward Caste in modern India's positive discrimination system. They are a politically dominant community in Andhra Pradesh, their rise having dated from the formation of the state in 1956.\n\n"}

Negative stereotypes are associated with prejudice and discrimination that continue to impact the lives of indigenous peoples.\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas are commonly called Native Americans, Alaska Natives or First Nations (in Canada). The Circumpolar peoples, often referred to by the English term Eskimo, have a distinct set of stereotypes. Eskimo itsef is an an exonym, deriving from phrases that Algonquin tribes used for their northern neighbors.\n\nIt is believed that some portrayals of natives, such as their depiction as bloodthirsty savages have disappeared. However, most portrayals are oversimplified and inaccurate; these stereotypes are found particularly in popular media which is the main source of mainstream images of Indigenous peoples world-wide.\n\nThe stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes conquest, forced displacement, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate and to assimilate them as European Americans.\n\nThe first difficulty in addressing stereotypes is the terminology to use when referring to Indigenous peoples, which is an ongoing controversy. The truly stereotype-free names would be those of individual nations. A practical reference to Indigenous peoples in general is \"Native American\" in the United States and \"First Nations\" or \"Aboriginal\" in Canada. The peoples collectively referred to as Inuit have their own unique stereotypes. The communities to which Indigenous peoples belong also have various names, typically \"nation\" or \"tribe\" in the United States, but \"comunidad\" (Spanish for \"community\") in South America.\n\nAll global terminology must be used with an awareness of the stereotype that \"Indians\" are a single people, when in fact there are hundreds of individual ethnic group, who are all native to the Americas. This type of awareness is obvious when European Americans refer to Europeans with an understanding that there are some similarities, but many differences between the peoples of an entire continent.\n\nAll of the myths about Native Americans can be understood in the context of the metanarrative of the United States, which was originally \"manifest destiny\" and has now become \"American exceptionalism\". Myths and stereotypes persist because they fit into these narratives, which Americans use to understand their own history.\n\nStereotypes may be grouped with regard to different characteristics: historical, cultural, and racial.\n\nThere are numerous distortions of history, many of which continue as stereotypes.\n\nThere is the myth that Indians are a dying race, i.e. \"The Vanishing Red Man\", when in fact census data shows an increase in the number of individuals who were American Indians and Alaska Natives or American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races.\n\nThere is an assumption that Indians lost possession of their land because they were inferior, when the reality is:\n\nOne stereotype held by non-Indians is that Indians receive special privileges that other American citizens do not. This view is based upon failure to understand the nature of the relationship between Native tribes and the Federal government of the United States. Tribes signed treaties that grant certain rights in exchange for the cession of land, therefore, many of these \"privileges\" are considered treaty obligations. So education and health care have been \"bought and paid for\" by Native ancestors.\n\nToday, Native Americans are perceived to have become wealthy due to casino revenues. Not all tribes own tribal gaming operations/establishments and many tribal groups have issues related to tribal ancestry, such as not being able to obtain paychecks unless they can not prove their tribal membership roll.\n\nThe \"purchase\" of Manhattan island from Indians is a cultural misunderstanding. In 1626 the director of the Dutch settlement, Peter Minuit, traded sixty guilders worth of goods with the Lenni Lenape, which they would have accepted as a gifts in exchange for allowing the settlers to occupy the land. Native Americans had no conception of private ownership of natural resources.\n\nThe story told by John Smith of his rescue by the daughter of Powhatan is generally agreed to be untrue. Pocahontas would have been eleven or twelve at the time, so this popular tale of the \"Indian Princess\" and the Englishman has no basis in known facts.\n\nThe Media Awareness Network of Canada (MNet) has prepared a number of statements about the portrayals of American Indians, First Nations of Canada and Alaskan Natives in the media. Westerns and documentaries have tended to portray Natives in stereotypical terms: the wise elder, the aggressive drunk, the Indian princess, the loyal sidekick, obese and impoverished. These images have become known across North America. Stereotyped issues include simplistic characterizations, romanticizing of Native culture and stereotyping by omission—showing American Indians in a historical rather than modern context.\n\nNative Americans were also portrayed as fierce warriors and braves, often appearing in school sports teams' names until such team names fell into disfavor in the later 20th century. Many school team names have been revised to reflect current sensibilities, though professional teams such as American football's Kansas City Chiefs and Washington Redskins, baseball's Atlanta Braves, and ice hockey's Chicago Blackhawks continue. Some controversial upper-level Native American team mascots such as Chief Noc-A-Homa and Chief Illiniwek have been discontinued, while some such as Chief Osceola and Renegade remain. A controversy over the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo was resolved in 2012.\n\nThere have been ongoing issues with the continuation of professional team names and mascots especially in the Washington Redskins name controversy. In 2013, President Obama and NBC sportscaster Bob Costas voiced their objection to the name. After a petition, the Trademark and Trial Appeal Board ordered the cancellation of six federal trademark registrations in 2014. The Redskins are appealing this ruling. \n\nThe use of Geronimo as the code name for Osama bin Laden in the operation that killed him is seen by some Native Americans as the continued stereotyping of Indians.\n\nThere is the outdated stereotype that American Indians and Alaskan Natives live on reservations when in fact only about 25% do, and a slight majority now live in urban areas.\n\nThere is an assumption that Indians somehow have an intuitive knowledge of their culture and history, when the degree of such knowledge varies greatly depending upon the family and community connections of each individual.\n\nNative American women are frequently sexually objectified and are often stereotyped as being promiscuous. Such misconceptions lead to murder, rape and violence against Native American women and girls by non-Native men.\n\nAn Algonquin word, the term \"squaw\" is now widely deemed offensive due to its use for hundreds of years in a derogatory context. However, there remains more than a thousand locations in the U.S. that incorporate the term in its name.\n\nBecause of the high frequency of American Indian alcoholism, a stereotype has been applied to all American Indians. As with most groups, the incidence of substance abuse is related to issues of poverty and mental distress, both of which may be, in part, the result of racial stereotyping and discrimination. Treatment for substance abuse by Native Americans is more effective when it is community-based, and addresses the issues of cultural identification.\n\nInuit, often referred to as Eskimos (which many see as derogatory), are usually depicted dressed in parkas, paddling kayaks, which the Inuit people invented, carving out trinkets, living in igloos, going fishing with a harpoon, hunting whales, traveling by sleigh and huskies, eating cod-liver oil and the men are called Nanook in reference to the documentary \"Nanook of the North\". Eskimo children may have a seal for a best friend.\n\nEskimos are sometimes shown rubbing noses together in greeting ritual, referred to as Eskimo kissing or preferably \"Inuit kissing\" in Western culture, and only loosely based on an authentic Inuit practice known as \"kunik\". They are also often depicted surrounded by polar bears, walruses and inaccurately, with penguins, which do not live in the Arctic.\n\nStereotypes harm both the victims and those that perpetuate them, with effects of the society at large. Victims suffer the emotional distress; anger, frustration, insecurity, and feelings of hopelessness. Most of all, Indian children exposed at an early age to these mainstream images internalize the stereotypes paired with the images, resulting in lower self-esteem, contributing to all of the other problems faced by Native Americans. Stereotypes become discrimination when the assumptions of being more prone to violence and alcoholism limit job opportunities. This leads directly to Indians being viewed less stable economically, making it more difficult for those that have succeeded to fully enjoy the benefits in the same way that non-Indians do, such as obtaining credit. For those that maintain them, stereotypes prevent a more accurate view of Indians and the history of the United States.\n\nResearch also demonstrates the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. Two studies examined the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot on the tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group. A study was first done at the University of Illinois, and then replicated at The College of New Jersey with the same results. Students were given a paragraph to read about Chief Illiniwek adapted from the University of Illinois' official website; while the control group was given a description of an arts center. In both studies the students exposed to the sports mascot were more likely to express stereotypical views of Asian-Americans. Although Chief Illiniwek was described only in terms of positive characteristics (as a respectful symbol, not a mascot), the stereotyping of Asian-Americans included negative characteristics, such as being \"socially inept\". This was indicative of a spreading effect; exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking.\n\nIn Alabama, at a game between the Pinson Valley High School \"Indians\" and McAdory High School, the latter team displayed a banner using a disparaging reference to the Trail of Tears for which the principal of the school apologized to Native Americans, stated that the cheerleader squad responsible would be disciplined, and that all students would be given a lesson on the actual history of the Trail of Tears. Native Americans responded that it was an example of the continuing insensitivity and stereotyping of Indians in America. A similar sign was displayed in Tennessee by the Dyersburg Trojans when they played the Jackson Northside Indians.\n\nThe effect that stereotyping has had on Indigenous women is one of the main reasons why non-Indigenous people commit violent crimes of hate towards First Nations women and girls. Because Aboriginal women have been associated with images of the \"Indian Princess\" and \"Squaw\" some non-Indigenous people believe that Aboriginal women are dirty, promiscuous, overtly sexualized, which makes these women vulnerable to violent assaults. Colonial culture has been foundation of these stereotypes creating a relationship of violence and hatred, which justifies the treatment of First Nations peoples to this day.\n\nThe mainstream media makes a lot of money making movies that play along with stereotypes; while accurate portrayals may be critically acclaimed they are not often made or widely distributed.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) made efforts to improve the portrayals of Aboriginal people in its television dramas. \"Spirit Bay\", \"The Beachcombers\", \"North of 60\" and \"The Rez\" used Native actors to portray their own people, living real lives and earning believable livelihoods in identifiable parts of the country.\n\n\"Imagining Indians\" is a 1992 documentary film produced and directed by Native American filmmaker, Victor Masayesva, Jr. (Hopi). The documentary attempts to reveal the misrepresentation of Indigenous Native American culture and tradition in Classical Hollywood films by interviews with different Indigenous Native American actors and extras from various tribes throughout the United States.\n\nReel Injun is a 2009 Canadian documentary film directed by Cree filmmaker Neil Diamond, Catherine Bainbridge, and Jeremiah Hayes that explores the portrayal of Native Americans in film. Reel Injun is illustrated with excerpts from classic and contemporary portrayals of Native people in Hollywood movies and interviews with filmmakers, actors and film historians, while director Diamond travels across the United States to visit iconic locations in motion picture as well as American Indian history.\n\nReel Injun explores many stereotypes about Natives in film, from the Noble savage to the Drunken Indian. It profiles such figures as Iron Eyes Cody, an Italian American who reinvented himself as a Native American on screen. The film also explores Hollywood's practice of using Italian Americans and American Jews to portray Indians in the movies and reveals how some Native American actors made jokes in their native tongue on screen when the director thought they were simply speaking gibberish.\n\n\"Inventing the Indian\" is a 2012 BBC documentary first broadcast on 28 October on BBC 4 exploring the stereotypical view of Native Americans in the United States in cinema and literature.\n\n\n"}

The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. \n\nDevelopers can purchase the development rights of certain parcels within a designated \"sending district\" and transfer the rights to another \"receiving district\" to increase the density of their new development. Alternatively, parcels with buildings that do not use all of their available size have \"excess\" developable capacity that can be conveyed to other parcels, possibly adjoining the first parcels. A widely-noted example of districted TDRs is the Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve. TDR programs have been implemented in over 200 U.S. communities, in several states, including Colorado, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington. Receiving districts are generally areas more suited for higher density developments and sending districts are areas with environmental, heritage or agricultural values that the county, city or town wishes to preserve.\nTDR credit banks can be used to store development rights that have been purchased if there is not yet a receiving area development identified. This mechanism is used when the time of the sale in the sending area is not concurrent with a development in the receiving area. It is also useful in communities that have the opportunity to purchase the rights from an area of high conservation interest but do not have a development that can receive higher density at the time. TDR credit banks should be operated by a third party organization that is empowered to negotiate the sale of development rights such as a non-profit organization or an agency operating within the community.\n\n"}
