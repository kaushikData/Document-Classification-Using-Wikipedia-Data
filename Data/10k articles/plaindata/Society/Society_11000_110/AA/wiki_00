Because of her role in revenge and retribution, she was usually portrayed with Nemesis, and sometimes identical to Nemesis herself, who had the epithet of Adrestia or Adrasteia. She was also believed to be another war figure, similar to her brothers Phobos and Deimos.\n\nThe union between Ares and Aphrodite produced many children: Eros (the god of love), Anteros (the god of requited love), Phobos (the god of fear), Deimos (the god of terror) and Harmonia (the goddess of harmony and concord), besides Adrestia herself.

Also called 'Araijan Kodi'. It is made of gold, silver or thick thread. The primary purpose is to measure the healthy growth of an infant by the increase of the waistline. Aranjanam can also fasten the cloth on the waist, similar to women using it to secure the folds of a sari. It is possible that some parents also believe that it will safeguard against evil spirits. Although in India, most women and many men continue to wear them as adults as well.\n\nAncient Tamil people used it, mentioned in Tolkappiyam, Sangam literature describes the usage of Araijan by the words \"வெண்ஞான்\" (Venjan - made of silver) and \"பொன்ஞான்\" (Ponjan - made of gold). A village in Tamil Nadu was named after it called 'Venjan Kondaan' meaning one who wore Silver Araijan.\n\nThin ornamental gold or silver chain worn around the midriff, under clothing. In India, it is worn by many women and men, and most children and babies.\n\nAn Aranjanam is given to babies of both genders and all religious affiliations, particularly in south India, on the 28th day after the baby's birth, as part of a ceremony called Irupathettu in which the baby is given its name, its first jewellery, eye makeup and a meal of sweet porridge.\n\nPseudo-scientific Reason\nApart from Gold / Silver the rope has a \"Thayathu\" a small capsule made of gold or silver to hold the umbilical chord dried and stored in sealed format inside it. In modern day science we call these cells as stem cells which can help in curing many disease and tissue replacements as those cells are available only during child birth and preserved for a fee in modern hospitals.\n\nThis is pseudo science because modern science has determined that these cells need to be preserved in their “alive” and “able to multiply” state in order to be used in stem cell therapy. Dried and powdered cells are of no medicinal value and are a placebo along the lines of rhinos horns which are believed to have medicinal value elsewhere.\n\nIn Kerala, This ceremony is performed on the 28th day after birth of the child, as this is the first time the nakshatram (star) of the child repeats according to the Malayalam calendar. During the ceremony, charadu (thread), one in black cotton and the other a chain in gold are intertwined and tied around the waist of the child - this is usually done by the father of the child. This thread is called 'Aranjanam'. The child's eyes are lined with mayye or kanmashi (Kohl). A black spot is placed on one cheek or asymmetrically on the forehead, to ward off the evil eyes. The father whispers the chosen Hindu name in the child's right ear three times while the left ear is covered with a betel leaf. This is then repeated with the left ear. A mixture of ghee (melted and clarified butter) and honey is given to the infant as a base for its various foods in the future.\n\n"}

In general, bow tie architectures refer to ordered and recurrent structures that often underlie complex technological or biological systems, and that are capable of conferring them a balance among efficiency, robustness and evolvability. In other words, bow ties are able to take into account a great diversity of inputs (fanning in to the knot), showing a much smaller diversity in the protocols and processes (the \"knot\") able to elaborate these inputs, and finally an extremely heterogeneous diversity of outputs (fanning out of the bowtie). These architectures thus manage a wide range of inputs through a \"core\" (knot) constituted by a limited number of elements. In such structures, inputs are conveyed into a sort of funnel, towards a \"synthesis\" core, where they can be duly organized, processed and managed by means of protocols , and from where, in turn, a variety of outputs, or responses, is propagated.\nAccording to Csete and Doyle, bow ties are able to optimally organize fluxes of mass, energy, signals in an overall structure that forcedly deals with a highly fluctuating and \"sloppy\" environment. In a biological perspective, a bow tie manages a large \"fan in\" of stimuli (input), it accounts for a \"compressed\" \"core\", and it expresses again a large \"fan out\" of possible phenotypes, metabolite products, or –more generally – reusable modules. Bow tie architectures have been observed in the structural organization at different scales of living and evolving organisms (e.g. bacterial metabolism network) as well as in technological and dynamical systems (e.g. the Internet). Bow ties seem to be able to mediate trade-offs among robustness and efficiency, at the same time assuring to the system the capability to evolve.\nConversely, the same efficient architecture may be prone and vulnerable to fragilities due to specific changes, perturbations, and focused attacks directed against the core set of modules and protocols.\nThe bow tie architecture is one of several different structures and functioning principles that living matter employs to achieve self-organization and efficient exploitation of available resources.\n"}
{"id": "18541294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541294", "title": "Bwa people", "text": "Bwa people\n\nThe Bwa or Bwaba (plural), or Bobo-Wule (Bobo-Oule), are an ethnic group indigenous to central Burkina Faso and Mali. Their population is approximately 300,000. They are known for their use of masks, made from leaves or wood, used in performative ceremonies.\n\nIn the 18th century, Bwa lands were occupied by the Bamana empire who made the Bwa pay taxes. The places left unconquered were raided by the Bamana, which led to a weakening of the Bwa social and political systems. In the 19th century, the Bamana declined and the area was dominated by the Fulani who raided and enslaved the Bwa and stole their livestock. The end of the 19th century brought French mercenaries who used the Fulani to help control the area. The Bwa traditions of storing crops for use in lean years were undermined by the crippling taxation systems of the French and they suffered further from famine from 1911–1913. The French demanded military recruits from the Bwa and in 1915, the Bwa revolted., starting the Volta-Bani War. This war lasted about a year and ended with the destruction of many Bwa villages.\n\nThe Bwa live in central Burkina Faso and south-east Mali, between Mali's Bani River and the Mouhoun River (Black Volta) in Burkina Faso. Their total population is approximately 300, 000. The major towns occupied by the Bwa are Houndé, Boni, Bagassi, Dossi and Pa.\n\nLike many of their neighbours, the Bwa are predominantly farmers, their main cash crop being cotton. They also farm millet, rice, sorghum, yams, and peanuts. Bwa villages are autonomous and they do not recognise any outside political authority. They are led by a council of male elders who make all the major decisions. Villages are structured with a cluster of mud walled buildings around a central space where livestock are guarded at night.\n\nThe Bwa speak Bwa languages, a closely related group of Gur languages of the Niger–Congo family. Some speak Jula (Dioula) for trading and communication with outsiders, and French is also used.\n\nMost Bwa still retain traditional animist beliefs. Approximately 5% are Muslim, approximately 10% are Christian and approximately 85% are animists.\n\nThe creator god of the Bwa is known as Wuro, Difini or Dobweni. He created the world by setting his creations up in balanced opposing pairs (for example male and female, domesticated and wild). \nThe Bwa have to work to maintain the balance. Wuro left the earth after being wounded by a woman pounding millet. He had three sons: Dwo (or Do), god of new life and rebirth; Soxo, god of the wilderness and Kwere, the god of lightning. Wuro sent Dwo, with his brothers, to earth as his messenger and manifestation.\n\nThe Bwa, (the northern Bwa in particular) worship Dwo as an intermediary between man and nature. The religious leader of each village is an earth priest called the \"labie\", the oldest man of the village. The congregation of Dwo is a strong cohesive force in Bwa villages. The Bwa share their Dwo religion with the neighbouring Bobo people, and probably acquired it from the Bobo centuries ago. In the late 19th century, following decades of oppression and misfortune, many southern Bwa villages abandoned the cult of Dwo and adopted the religion of their Nuna neighbours.\n\nThe Bwa are well known for their use of traditional tribal masks. The masks, made from wood and leaves, are used in traditional rituals. In particular the Southern Bwa are known for their tall plank masks, known as \"nwantantay\", and tend to use wood to make their masks. This is a result of their adoption of Nuna religion and their traditions of using wooden masks. About 1897, after a series of disasters, including the arrival of the French and their Senegalese mercenaries, the Bwa decided God had abandoned them, so they turned to their Nuna neighbors and purchased the rights to use, wear, and carve wooden masks, their costumes, and the songs and dances that go with them. The religion associated with wooden masks is focused on the spirit Lanle, whose power is manifested through the wooden masks. The northern Bwa use leaf masks more than wooden ones. These leaf masks frequently represent Dwo in religious ceremonies. The masks also represent the bush spirits including serpents, monkeys, buffalo and hawks. Mask performances generally take place in the dry season between February and May.\n\nEarly European explorers to the area called the Bwa \"Bobo\", confusing them with their neighbours the Bobo people. Although the two groups share religion and culture, they are ethnically distinct. The confusion led to alternative names for the Bwa including Bobo Oule, or Eastern Bobo. In Jula, Bobo Oule means \"Red Bobo\". This distinguishes the Bwa from the Bobo who are called the \"Black Bobo\". \n\nThe White Bobo, \"Bobo Gbe\", are also Bwa.\n\nThe southern Bwa became known by their neighbours as \"Nieniegue\" meaning \"scarred Bwa\" as a result of the tradition of scarification of their faces and bodies. This practice is no longer commonplace and so the term is also in decline.\n"}

He is credited with leading the Mexica resistance to the Spanish invasion, following the death of his kinsman Moctezuma II.\n\nCuitláhuac was the eleventh son of the ruler Axayacatl and a younger brother of Moctezuma II, the late ruler of Tenochtitlan, who died during the Spanish occupation of the city. His mother's father, also called Cuitlahuac, had been ruler of Iztapalapa, and the younger Cuitláhuac also ruled there initially. Cuitláhuac was an experienced warrior and an adviser to Moctezuma, warning him not to allow the Spaniards to enter Tenochtitlan. Hernán Cortés imprisoned both Moctezuma and Cuitláhuac. Following the massacre of Aztec elites when Cortés was away from Tenochtitlan, the Mexica besieged the Spanish and their indigenous allies. Cuitláhuac was released on the pretense to reopen the market to get food to the invaders. Moctezuma was killed under disputed circumstances, and Cuitláhuac was elected \"tlatoani\" following the flight of the Spaniards and their allies form Tenochtitlan on June 30, 1520. Some sources claim he was serving in that role even before Moctezuma's death.\n\nCuitláhuac was ritually married to Moctezuma's eldest daughter, a ten- or eleven-year-old girl, who later was called Isabel Moctezuma.\nCuitláhuac ruled just 80 days, perhaps dying from smallpox that had been introduced to the New World by the Europeans.

The National Office of Statistics of Cuba (ONE) since 1953. The most recent census was conducted in September 2012. The population of Cuba at the 2012 census was 11.1 million. The population density is 100.7 inhabitants per square kilometer, and the overall life expectancy in Cuba is 78.0 years. The population has always increased from one census to the next, with the exception of the 2011 census, when the count decreased by 10,000. Since 1950, Cuba's birth rate has surpassed its death rate; the natural growth rate of the country is positive. Cuba is in the fourth stage of demographic transition. In terms of age structure, the population is dominated (71.1%) by the 15- to 64-year-old segment. The median age of the population is 39.5, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.99 males per female.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census, Cuba's population was 11,177,743, whereas the 2012 census numbered the population at 11,167,325. The drop between the 2002 and 2012 censuses was the first drop in Cuba's population since Cuba's war of independence. This drop was due to low fertility and emigration, as during this time (fiscal years 2003-2012), 332,028 Cubans received legal permanent residence in the United States. In the last few years before the end of the wet feet, dry feet policy in January 12, 2017, the number of Cubans moving to the United States significantly outnumbered the natural increase during those years.\n\nSee Also List of cities in Cuba\n\nNº, City, Population, Province\n\nStructure of the population :\n\nStructure of the population (01.07.2013) (Estimates):\n\n--align= \"right\" left 3566178\n\nThe 2002 census figures supplied by the government claim that 65% of Cubans were white.\n\nThe ancestry of Cubans comes from many sources:\n\n\nDuring the 18th, 19th and early part of the 20th century, large waves of Spanish immigrants from Canary Islands, Catalonia, Andalusia, Galicia, and Asturias emigrated to Cuba. Between 1820 and 1898, a total of 508,455 people left Spain, and more than 750,000 Spanish immigrants left for Cuba between 1899 and 1930, with many returning to Spain.. There are 139,851 Spanish citizens living in Cuba on January, 1, 2018.\n\n\nThe Slave trade brought Africans to Cuba during its early history:\nBetween 1842 and 1873, 221,000 African slaves entered Cuba.\n\n\nPeople of the Americas:\n\nOther European people that have contributed include:\n\n\nPeople from Asia:\nBetween 1842 and 1873, 124,800 Chinese arrived.\n\n\nThere is also a small number of Jews living in Cuba.\n\nAn autosomal study from 2014 has found out the genetic average ancestry in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African and 8% Native American with different proportions depending on the self-reported ancestry (White, Mulatto or Mestizo, and Black):\n\nA 1995 study done on the population of Pinar del Rio, found that 50% of the Mt-DNA lineages (female lineages) could be traced back to Europeans, 46% to Africans and 4% to Native Americans. This figure is consistent with both the historical background of the region, and the current demographics of it.\n\nAccording to another study in 2008, the Native American contribution to present-day Cubans accounted for 33% of the maternal lineages, whereas Africa and Eurasia contributed 45% and 22% of the lineages, respectively. Haplogroup A2 is the main Native American haplogroup in Cuba (21.9% of the total sample), accounting for 67% of the Native American mtDNA gene pool. Regarding Y-chromosome haplogroups (male lineages), 78.8% of the sequences found in Cubans are of West Eurasian origin, 19.7% of African origin and 1.5% of East Asian origin. Among the West Eurasian fraction, the vast majority of individuals belong to West European haplogroup R1b. The African lineages found in Cubans have a Western (haplogroups E1, E2, E1b1a ) and Northern (E1b1b-M81 ) African origin. The \"Berber\" haplogroup E1b1b1b (E-M81), is found at a frequency of 6.1%.\n\nAccording to Fregel et al. (2009), the fact that autochthonous male North African E-M81 and female U6 lineages from the Canaries have been detected in Cuba and Iberoamerica, demonstrates that Canary Islanders with indigenous ancestors actively participated in the American colonization.\n\nSpanish is the official language of Cuba. Of all the regional variations of Spanish, Cuban Spanish is most similar to, and originates largely from, the dialect spoken in the Canary Islands. This is a consequence of Canarian migration, which in the 19th and early 20th century was heavy and continuous. There were also migrations of Galicians and Asturians as well, but they did not impact Cuban Spanish to the same degree.\n\nMuch of the typical Cuban replacements for standard Spanish vocabulary stems from Canarian lexicon. For example, ' (bus) differs from standard Spanish ' the former originated in the Canaries and is an onomatopoeia stemming from the sound of a Klaxon horn (wah-wah!). An example of Canarian usage for a Spanish word is the verb (\"to fight\"). In standard Spanish the verb would be \"\", while \"fajar\" exists as a non-reflexive verb related to the hemming of a skirt.\n\nThe second most spoken language of Cuba is Haitian Creole, used mainly by Haitian immigrants and its descendants going back since the late 18th century, of whom fled the Haitian Revolution.\n\nOther languages of Cuba are Cuban Sign Language, and English is commonly studied as a foreign language.\n\nThere are also reports of Lucumi, \"Lengua Conga\" (Kongo-based liturgical language of the Palo religion) and Bozal Spanish (an \"African\" socio-dialect of Spanish; now used only in folk religion). Historically, the Ciboney and Classic dialects of Taino and the unattested Guanahatabey were spoken.\n\nCuba has a multitude of faiths reflecting the island's diverse cultural elements. Catholicism, which was brought to the island by Spanish colonialists at the beginning of the 16th century, is the most prevalent professed faith. After the revolution, Cuba became an officially atheistic state and restricted religious practice. Since the Fourth Cuban Communist Party Congress in 1991, restrictions have been eased and, according to the National Catholic Observer, direct challenges by state institutions to the right to religion have all but disappeared, though the church still faces restrictions of written and electronic communication, and can only accept donations from state-approved funding sources. The Roman Catholic Church is made up of the Cuban Catholic Bishops' Conference (COCC), led by Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino, Cardinal Archbishop of Havana. It has eleven dioceses, 56 orders of nuns and 24 orders of priests. In January 1998, Pope John Paul II paid a historic visit to the island, invited by the Cuban government and Catholic Church.\n\nAfro-Cuban religions, a blend of native African religions and Roman Catholicism, are widely practiced in Cuba. This diversity derives from West and Central Africans who were transported to Cuba, and in effect reinvented their African religions. They did so by combining them with elements of the Catholic belief system, with a result very similar to Brazil. One of these Afro-Cuban religions is Santeria.\n\nProtestantism, introduced from the United States in the 18th century, has seen a steady increase in popularity. 300,000 Cubans belong to the island's 54 Protestant denominations. Pentecostalism has grown rapidly in recent years, and the Assemblies of God alone claims a membership of over 100,000 people. The Episcopal Church of Cuba claims 10,000 adherents.

{"id": "428932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428932", "title": "Edge of chaos", "text": "Edge of chaos\n\nThe term edge of chaos is used to denote a transition space between order and disorder that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This transition zone between the two regimes is known as the edge of chaos, a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant dynamic interplay between order and disorder.\n\nEven though the idea of the edge of chaos is abstract and unintuitive, it has many applications in such fields as ecology, business management, psychology, political science, and other domains of the social science. Physicists have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback.\n\nThe phrase \"edge of chaos\" was coined by mathematician Doyne Farmer to describe the transition phenomenon discovered by computer scientist Christopher Langton. The phrase originally refers to an area in the range of a variable, λ (lambda), which was varied while examining the behavior of a cellular automaton (CA). As λ varied, the behavior of the CA went through a phase transition of behaviors. Langton found a small area conducive to produce CAs capable of universal computation. At around the same time physicist James P. Crutchfield and others used the phrase \"onset of chaos\" to describe more or less the same concept.\n\nIn the sciences in general, the phrase has come to refer to a metaphor that some physical, biological, economic and social systems operate in a region between order and either complete randomness or chaos, where the complexity is maximal. The generality and significance of the idea, however, has since been called into question by Melanie Mitchell and others. The phrase has also been borrowed by the business community and is sometimes used inappropriately and in contexts that are far from the original scope of the meaning of the term.\n\nStuart Kauffman has studied mathematical models of evolving systems in which the rate of evolution is maximized near the edge of chaos.\n\nAdaptation plays a vital role for all living organisms and systems. All of them are constantly changing their inner properties to better fit in the current environment. The most important instruments for the adaptation are the self-adjusting parameters inherent for many natural systems. The prominent feature of systems with self-adjusting parameters is an ability to avoid chaos.The name for this phenomenon is \"Adaptation to the edge of chaos\".\n\nAdaptation to the edge of chaos refers to the idea that many complex adaptive systems seem to intuitively evolve toward a regime near the boundary between chaos and order. Physics have shown that edge of chaos is the optimal settings for control of a system. It is also an optional setting that can influence the ability of a physical system to perform primitive functions for computation.\n\nBecause of the importance of adaptation in many natural systems, adaptation to the edge of the chaos takes a prominent position in many scientific researches. Physicists demonstrated that adaptation to state at the boundary of chaos and order occurs in population of cellular automata rules which optimize the performance evolving with a genetic algorithm. Another example of this phenomenon is the self-organized criticality in avalanche and earthquake models.\n\nThe simplest model for chaotic dynamics is the logistic map. Self-adjusting logistic map dynamics exhibit adaptation to the edge of chaos. Theoretical analysis allowed prediction of the location of the narrow parameter regime near the boundary to which the system evolves.\nSelf-organized criticality\n\n"}

He helped to investigate the Syrian Civil War, 2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and the Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. He first gained mainstream media attention by identifying weapons in uploaded videos from the Syrian conflict. He is the founder of Bellingcat, a website for citizen journalists to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures.\n\nHiggins was born in Shrewsbury in January 1979. He attended Adams' Grammar School in Shropshire from 1990-95.\n\nHis previous work history includes work in finance and admin. In 2012, when Higgins began blogging the Syrian civil war, he was unemployed and spent his days taking care of his child at home; he is married to a Turkish woman. Higgins took the pseudonym Brown Moses from the Frank Zappa song \"Brown Moses\" on the album \"Thing-Fish\".\n\nHiggins' analyses of Syrian weapons, which began as a hobby out of his home in his spare time, are frequently cited by the press and human rights groups and have led to parliamentary discussion. His Brown Moses Blog began in March 2012 by covering the Syrian conflict. Higgins operates by monitoring over 450 YouTube channels daily looking for images of weapons and tracking when new types appear in the war, where, and with whom. According to \"Guardian\" reporter Matthew Weaver, Higgins has been \"hailed as something of a pioneer\" for his work. Higgins has no background or training in weapons and is entirely self-taught, saying that \"Before the Arab spring I knew no more about weapons than the average Xbox owner. I had no knowledge beyond what I'd learned from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rambo.\" Higgins does not speak or read Arabic.\n\nHiggins is credited with being among the first to report on the widespread use of improvised barrel bombs by the Syrian government, a phenomenon which has spread to other troubled nations such as Iraq to combat insurgencies and opposition forces.\n\nOther aspects of the Syrian conflict uncovered and documented by Higgins include the use of cluster bombs in 2012, which the Syrian government previously denied using; the proliferation of shoulder-launched heat-seeking missiles known as MANPADS; and the proliferation of Croatian-made weapons which was reportedly connected to the United States, a story later picked up by \"The New York Times\". He has also investigated the Syrian regime's alleged use of chemical weapons, including the Ghouta chemical attack in detail. Higgins has also performed consulting work for groups such as Human Rights Watch.<ref name=\"Bosker\" / Theodore Postol, a professor at MIT, and Richard Lloyd, a former UN weapons inspector, criticised some aspects of Higgins's work.\n\nHiggins used geolocation to publish an estimate of where the James Foley execution video was made outside Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold in north-central Syria. Higgins used visual markers in stills from the video and his interpretation of satellite images of the terrain around Raqqa.\n\nIn 2018 Higgins was a visiting research associate at the \"Centre for Science and Security Studies\" (CSSS) at the Department of War Studies at King’s College London and visiting research fellow at University of California Berkeley's Human Rights Center. In October of that year, Higgins was the subject of BBC Radio Four's programme \"Profile\".\n\nOn 15 July 2014, Higgins began a new website called Bellingcat for citizen journalists to investigate current events using open-source information such as videos, maps and pictures. Its launch was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. Bellingcat's self-taught open-source analysts include Higgins and eight volunteers.\n\nAmong its major projects, Bellingcat has investigated the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine. Its work is being considered by the Dutch police investigating the crash, and Higgins has been interviewed twice by the investigators. Bellingcat has suggested that the anti-aircraft missile that hit the plane was fired by a Russian unit, the 53rd Buk brigade, based in the city of Kursk. On 31 May 2015, Bellingcat released a report alleging among other things photo manipulation of satellite images released by the Russian Ministry of Defense. The photos concerned the location of Ukrainian Buk missile launchers around the time MH17 was shot down. Bellingcat's use of error level analysis in its report was criticized by Jens Kriese, a professional image analyst. Nevertheless, Bellingcat's findings about which field the missile was fired from were vindicated in September 2016 by the Dutch-led MH17 Joint Investigation Team.\n\nHiggins is a senior fellow in the Digital Forensic Research Lab (since 2016) and \"Future Europe Initiative\", projects run by the Atlantic Council, a leading US geopolitical strategy think-tank based in Washington, D.C. \n\nIn 2015, Higgins partnered with the Atlantic Council to co-author the report Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin's War in Ukraine which examined direct Russian military involvement in Ukraine. The report was the inspiration for the documentary Selfie Soldiers in which Vice News correspondent Simon Ostrovsky followed digital traces left by a Russian soldier named Bato Dambaev who was sent to fight in Eastern Ukraine. In June 2015 on the invitation of former Belgium Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, Higgins together with his report co-author Atlantic Council's Maks Czuperski presented Hiding in Plain Sight at the European Parliament alongside Russian opposition figure Ilya Yashin and former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov. \n\nHiggins was one of five authors of an Atlantic Council report released in 2016, “Distract, Deceive, Destroy,” on Russia’s role in Syria.\n\nHiggins has received significant praise and support from human rights groups, journalists, and non-profit organisations. \"Brown Moses is among the best out there when it comes to weapons monitoring in Syria,\" said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch. \"The New York Times\" war reporter C.J. Chivers said that fellow journalists owe a debt to Higgins' investigative reporting in Syria. \"Many people, whether they admit or not, have been relying on that blog's daily labour to cull the uncountable videos that circulate from the conflict,\" he said. Amnesty International said that the Brown Moses Blog was vital in proving the Syrian government was using ballistic missiles, information then used to send a research mission to Syria.\n\nEliot Higgins has been a subject of interest for the British and U.S. media and is described described as \"one of the world's foremost citizen journalists\" by News Limited reporter Victoria Craw. He has been profiled in print by \"The Guardian\", \"The Independent\", \"The Huffington Post\", and \"The New Yorker\". Television features have been run by Channel 4 News and CNN International. He has also been covered by non-English sources.\n\n"}

They are people who act on behalf of a narcissist to a third party, usually for an abusive purpose. The phrase has also been used to refer to people who act on behalf of a psychopath for a similar purpose. An alternative word is apaths. Abuse by proxy (or proxy abuse) is a closely related or synonymous concept.\n\nFlying monkeys are distinct from enablers. Enablers just allow or cover for the narcissist's (abuser's) own bad behavior. The phrase, originally winged monkeys, is derived from L.

The wicked witch sent them to carry out her attacks.\n\nFlying monkeys can be anyone who believes the narcissist's fake persona including the narcissist's spouse, child, friend, sibling or cousin.\n\nAccording to Atkinson, flying monkeys are usually unwittingly manipulated people who believe the smears about the victim although they may be another narcissist working in tandem.\n\nAccording to Vaknin, proxy abusers can be: \n\nThe flying monkey does the narcissist’s bidding to inflict additional torment to the target. It may consist of spying, spreading gossip, threatening, painting the narcissist as the victim (victim playing) and the target as the perpetrator (victim blaming).

Service providers may be seduced by the narcissist's charm into taking a one-sided perspective. Family members may in good faith attempt to sort out the \"problematic one\". The codependent may seek to participate in the narcissist's omnipotence, or use them as sanction for their own aggressive instincts. Alternatively, others may simply be swept up by force of personality to define the situation along the narcissist's own lines.\n\n"}

The Hawwara are purely Berber in genetics, they usually only married within their family or from other Hawwara factions across North Africa to form external alliances.

It is an occasion for the hosts to present their new home to their friends, post-moving, and for friends to give gifts to furnish the new home. House-warming parties are generally informal. Usually there are no planned activities besides a possible tour.\n\nIt is considered proper etiquette to invite guests at least a few days, or up to three weeks, in advance.\n\nGifts are customarily necessary. They usually consist of something for the new house (such as a potted plant, a vase, or a picture frame) or something to be enjoyed during the party (such as a bottle of whiskey, a bouquet of flowers, or a gift basket of foodstuffs). Bluebirds are often given in some countries as they are believed to bless the new house with happiness and good luck. Today it is also customary to provide bluebird-themed paraphernalia such as china. Pineapples and coconuts are also common housewarming gifts and the pineapple and coconuts have served as a symbol of hospitality and warm welcome through the history of the Americas.\n\nIn East Lancashire as in parts of Scotland (particularly Ayrshire and Banffshire) a frog is seen as a giver of good luck. A gift of a frog is often made as a wedding or housewarming gift for good luck and fertility.\n\nIn Germany, common gifts include gift certificates, for example from a furniture shop. Guests also usually bring something to drink or a homemade dish, such as a salad or a pie.\n\nThe term \"housewarming\" is descended literally from the act of warming a new house, in the days before central heating. Each guest would bring firewood, and build fires in all the available fireplaces, offering firewood as a gift. Aside from warming the house, this was also believed to repel evil spirits by creating a protective atmosphere of warmth. Uninhabited houses were considered targets for vagrant spirits, and therefore used to require a certain level of cleansing before a house was safe to be occupied by young children.\nThe origin is from the medieval times.\n\nA housewarming party is called a \"pendaison de crémaillère\", literally \"hanging of the chimney hook\". The expression comes from medieval times. When the construction of the house was finished, it was customary to invite all those who participated in its building to eat dinner as a vote of thanks. The food was prepared in a large pot, the temperature of which was controlled by a chimney hook, which could adjust the pot so it sat higher or lower over the fireplace. This hook was the last thing to be installed in the new house, marking the beginning of the thank you meal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55510", "title": "Indigenous peoples in Brazil", "text": "Indigenous peoples in Brazil\n\nIndigenous peoples in Brazil () or Indigenous Brazilians (), comprise a large number of distinct ethnic groups who have inhabited what is now the country of Brazil since prior to the European contact around 1500. Unlike Christopher Columbus, who thought he had reached the East Indies, the Portuguese, most notably Vasco da Gama, had already reached India via the Indian Ocean route when they reached Brazil.\n\nNevertheless, the word (\"Indians\") was by then established to designate the people of the New World and continues to be used today in the Portuguese language to designate these people, while a person from India is called in order to distinguish the two.\n\nAt the time of European contact, some of the indigenous people were traditionally mostly semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering and migrant agriculture. Many of the estimated 2,000 nations and tribes which existed in the 16th century suffered extinction as a consequence of the European settlement, and many were assimilated into the Brazilian population.\n\nThe indigenous population was largely killed by European diseases, declining from a pre-Columbian high of millions to some 300,000 (1997), grouped into 200 tribes. However, the number could be much higher if the urban indigenous populations are counted in all the Brazilian cities today. A somewhat dated linguistic survey found 188 living indigenous languages with 155,000 total speakers.\n\nOn January 18, 2007, FUNAI reported that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different uncontacted tribes in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005. With this addition, Brazil has now surpassed New Guinea as the country having the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.\n\nBrazilian indigenous people have made substantial and pervasive contributions to the world's medicine with knowledge used today by pharmaceutical corporations, material, and cultural development—such as the domestication of tobacco and cassava.\n\nIn the last IBGE census (2010), 817,000 Brazilians classified themselves as indigenous.\n\nQuestions about the original settlement of the Americas has produced a number of hypothetical models. The origins of these indigenous people are still a matter of dispute among archaeologists.\n\nAnthropological and genetic evidence indicates that most Amerindian people descended from migrant people from North Asia (Siberia) who entered the Americas across the Bering Strait or along the western coast of North America in at least three separate waves. In Brazil, particularly, most native tribes who were living in the land by 1500 are thought to be descended from the first Siberian wave of migrants, who are believed to have crossed the Bering Land Bridge at the end of the last Ice Age, between 13,000 and 17,000 years before the present. A migrant wave would have taken some time after initial entry to reach present-day Brazil, probably entering the Amazon River basin from the Northwest. (The second and third migratory waves from Siberia, which are thought to have generated the Athabaskan, Aleut, Inuit, and Yupik people, apparently did not reach farther than the southern United States and Canada, respectively).\n\nAn analysis of Amerindian Y-chromosome DNA indicates specific clustering of much of the South American population. The micro-satellite diversity and distributions of the Y lineage specific to South America indicates that certain Amerindian populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of the region.\n\nAccording to an autosomal genetic study from 2012, Native Americans descend from at least three main migrant waves from East Asia. Most of it is traced back to a single ancestral population, called 'First Americans'. However, those who speak Inuit languages from the Arctic inherited almost half of their ancestry from a second East Asian migrant wave. And those who speak Na-dene, on the other hand, inherited a tenth of their ancestry from a third migrant wave. The initial settling of the Americas was followed by a rapid expansion southwards, by the coast, with little gene flow later, especially in South America. One exception to this are the Chibcha speakers, whose ancestry comes from both North and South America.\nAnother study, focused on the mtDNA (that which is inherited only through the maternal line), revealed that the indigenous people of the Americas have their maternal ancestry traced back to a few founding lineages from East Asia, which would have arrived via the Bering strait. According to this study, it is probable that the ancestors of the Native Americans would have remained for a time in the region of the Bering Strait, after which there would have been a rapid movement of settling of the Americas, taking the founding lineages to South America.\n\nLinguistic studies have backed up genetic studies, with ancient patterns having been found between the languages spoken in Siberia and those spoken in the Americas.\n\nTwo 2015 autosomal DNA genetic studies confirmed the Siberian origins of the Natives of the Americas. However an ancient signal of shared ancestry with the Natives of Australia and Melanesia was detected among the Natives of the Amazon region. The migration coming out of Siberia would have happened 23,000 years ago.\n\nAccording to a 2016 study, focused on mtDNA lineages, \"a small population entered the Americas via a coastal route around 16.0 ka, following previous isolation in eastern Beringia for ~2.4 to 9 thousand years after separation from eastern Siberian populations. Following a rapid movement throughout the Americas, limited gene flow in South America resulted in a marked phylogeographic structure of populations, which persisted through time. All of the ancient mitochondrial lineages detected in this study were absent from modern data sets, suggesting a high extinction rate. To investigate this further, we applied a novel principal components multiple logistic regression\ntest to Bayesian serial coalescent simulations. The analysis supported a scenario in which European colonization caused a substantial loss of pre-Columbian lineages\".\n\nBrazilian native people, unlike those in Mesoamerica and the western Andes, did not keep written records or erect stone monuments, and the humid climate and acidic soil have destroyed almost all traces of their material culture, including wood and bones. Therefore, what is known about the region's history before 1500 has been inferred and reconstructed from small-scale archaeological evidence, such as ceramics and stone arrowheads.\n\nThe most conspicuous remains of these societies are very large mounds of discarded shellfish (\"sambaquis\") found in some coastal sites which were continuously inhabited for over 5,000 years; and the substantial \"black earth\" (\"terra preta\") deposits in several places along the Amazon, which are believed to be ancient garbage dumps (middens). Recent excavations of such deposits in the middle and upper course of the Amazon have uncovered remains of some very large settlements, containing tens of thousands of homes, indicating a complex social and economic structure.\n\nMarajoara culture flourished on Marajó island at the mouth of the Amazon River. Archeologists have found sophisticated pottery in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Marajó. Evidence of mound building further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks.\n\nThe extent, level of complexity, and resource interactions of the Marajoara culture have been disputed. Working in the 1950s in some of her earliest research, American Betty Meggers suggested that the society migrated from the Andes and settled on the island. Many researchers believed that the Andes were populated by Paleoindian migrants from North America who gradually moved south after being hunters on the plains.\n\nIn the 1980s, another American archeologist, Anna Curtenius Roosevelt, led excavations and geophysical surveys of the mound Teso dos Bichos. She concluded that the society that constructed the mounds originated on the island itself.\n\nThe pre-Columbian culture of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population as large as 100,000 people. The Native Americans of the Amazon rain forest may have used their method of developing and working in Terra preta to make the land suitable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support large populations and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.\n\nOn the eve of the Portuguese arrival in 1500, the coastal areas of Brazil had two major mega-groups - the \"Tupi\" (speakers of Tupi–Guarani languages), who dominated practically the entire length of the Brazilian coast, and the \"Tapuia\" (a catch-all term for non-Tupis, usually Jê language people), who resided primarily in the interior. The Portuguese arrived in the final days of a long pre-colonial struggle between Tupis and Tapuias, which had resulted in the defeat and expulsion of the Tapuias from most coastal areas.\n\nAlthough the coastal Tupi were broken down into sub-tribes, frequently hostile to each other, they were culturally and linguistically homogeneous. The fact that the early Europeans encountered practically the same people and language all along the Brazilian coast greatly simplified early communication and interaction.\n\nCoastal Sequence c. 1500 (north to south):\n\nWith the exception of the hunter-gatherer Goitacases, the coastal Tupi and Tapuia tribes were primarily agriculturalists. The subtropical Guarani cultivated maize, tropical Tupi cultivated manioc (cassava), highland Jês cultivated peanut, as the staple of their diet. Supplementary crops included beans, sweet potatoes, cará (yam), \"jerimum\" (pumpkin), and \"cumari\" (capsicum pepper).\n\nBehind these coasts, the interior of Brazil was dominated primarily by Tapuia (Jê) people, although significant sections of the interior (notably the upper reaches of the Xingu, Teles Pires and Juruena Rivers - the area now covered roughly by modern Mato Grosso state) were the original pre-migration Tupi-Guarani homelands. Besides the Tupi and Tapuia, it is common to identify two other indigenous mega-groups in the interior: the Caribs, who inhabited much of what is now northwestern Brazil, including both shores of the Amazon River up to the delta and the Nuaraque group, whose constituent tribes inhabited several areas, including most of the upper Amazon (west of what is now Manaus) and also significant pockets in modern Amapá and Roraima states.\n\nThe names by which the different Tupi tribes were recorded by Portuguese and French authors of the 16th century are poorly understood. Most do not seem to be proper names, but descriptions of relationship, usually familial - e.g. \"tupi\" means \"first father\", \"tupinambá\" means \"relatives of the ancestors\", \"tupiniquim\" means \"side-neighbors\", \"tamoio\" means \"grandfather\", \"temiminó\" means \"grandson\", \"tabajara\" means \"in-laws\" and so on. Some etymologists believe these names reflect the ordering of the migration waves of Tupi people from the interior to the coasts, e.g. first Tupi wave to reach the coast being the \"grandfathers\" (Tamoio), soon joined by the \"relatives of the ancients\" (Tupinamba), by which it could mean relatives of the Tamoio, or a Tamoio term to refer to relatives of the old Tupi back in the upper Amazon basin. The \"grandsons\" (Temiminó) might be a splinter. The \"side-neighbors\" (Tupiniquim) meant perhaps recent arrivals, still trying to jostle their way in. However, by 1870 the Tupi tribes population had declined to 250,000 indígenas and by 1890 had diminished to an approximate 100,000 tribes.\n\nWhen the Portuguese explorers first arrived in Brazil in April 1500, they found, to their astonishment, a wide coastline rich in resources, teeming with hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people living in a \"paradise\" of natural riches. Pêro Vaz de Caminha, the official scribe of Pedro Álvares Cabral, the commander of the discovery fleet which landed in the present state of Bahia, wrote a letter to the King of Portugal describing in glowing terms the beauty of the land.\n\nAt the time of European arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had as many as 2,000 nations and tribes. The indigenous people were traditionally mostly semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. For hundreds of years, the indigenous people of Brazil lived a semi-nomadic life, managing the forests to meet their needs. When the Portuguese arrived in 1500, the natives were living mainly on the coast and along the banks of major rivers. Initially, the Europeans saw native people as noble savages, and miscegenation of the population began right away. Portuguese claims of tribal warfare, cannibalism, and the pursuit of Amazonian brazilwood for its treasured red dye convinced the Portuguese that they should \"civilize\" the natives (originally, colonists called Brazil Terra de Santa Cruz, until later it acquired its name (see List of meanings of countries' names) from brazilwood). But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their North American territories, had brought diseases with them against which many Indians were helpless due to lack of immunity. Measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenza killed tens of thousands. The diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and it is likely that whole tribes were annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans.\n\nThe mutual feeling of wonderment and good relationship was to end in the succeeding years.\nThe Portuguese colonists, all males, started to have children with female Amerindians, creating a new generation of mixed-race people who spoke Indian languages (a Tupi language called Nheengatu). The children of these Portuguese men and Indian women formed the majority of the population. Groups of fierce pathfinders organized expeditions called \"bandeiras\" (flags) into the backlands to claim them for the Portuguese crown and to look for gold and precious stones.\n\nIntending to profit from the sugar trade, the Portuguese decided to plant sugar cane in Brazil, and to use indigenous slaves as the workforce, as the Spanish colonies were successfully doing. But the indigenous people were hard to capture. They were soon infected by diseases brought by the Europeans against which they had no natural immunity, and began dying in great numbers.\n\nThe Jesuit priests, who had come with the first Governor General to provide religious assistance to the colonists, but mainly to convert the Pagan people to Catholicism, took the side of the Indians and extracted a Papal bull stating that they were human and should be protected.\n\nJesuit priests such as fathers José de Anchieta and Manuel da Nóbrega studied and recorded their language and founded mixed settlements, such as São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, where colonists and Indians lived side by side, speaking the same \"Língua Geral\" (common language) and freely intermarried. They began also to establish more remote villages peopled only by \"civilized\" Indians, called \"Missions\", or reductions (see the article on the Guarani people for more details).\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, Catholic Jesuit priests, at the behest of Portugal's monarchy, had established missions throughout the country's colonies. They became protectors of the Indians and worked to both Europeanize them and convert them to Catholicism. The Jesuits provided a period of relative stability for the Indians.\n\nIn the mid-1770s, the Indians' fragile co-existence with the colonists was again threatened. Because of a complex diplomatic web between Portugal, Spain and the Vatican, the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil and the missions confiscated and sold.\n\nBy 1800, the population of Brazil had reached approximately 3.25 million, of which only 250,000 were indigenous. And for the next four decades, the Indians were largely left alone.\n\nA number of wars between several tribes, such as the Tamoio Confederation, and the Portuguese ensued, sometimes with the Indians siding with enemies of Portugal, such as the French, in the famous episode of France Antarctique in Rio de Janeiro, sometimes allying themselves to Portugal in their fight against other tribes. At approximately the same period, a German soldier, Hans Staden, was captured by the Tupinambá and released after a while. He described it in a famous book, \"Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen\" (True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-eating People in the New World, America) (1557)\n\nThere are various documented accounts of smallpox being knowingly used as a biological weapon by New Brazilian villagers that wanted to get rid of nearby Indian tribes (not always aggressive ones). The most \"classical\", according to Anthropologist, Mércio Pereira Gomes, happened in Caxias, in south Maranhão, where local farmers, wanting more land to extend their cattle farms, gave clothing owned by ill villagers (that normally would be burned to prevent further infection) to the Timbira. The clothing infected the entire tribe, and they had neither immunity nor cure. Similar things happened in other villages throughout South America.\n\nThe 1840s brought trade and wealth to the Amazon. The process for vulcanizing rubber was developed, and worldwide demand for the product skyrocketed. The best rubber trees in the world grew in the Amazon, and thousands of rubber tappers began to work the plantations. When the Indians proved to be a difficult labor force, peasants from surrounding areas were brought into the region. In a dynamic that continues to this day, the indigenous population was at constant odds with the peasants, who the Indians felt had invaded their lands in search of treasure.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Brazilian Government adopted a more humanitarian attitude and offered official protection to the indigenous people, including the establishment of the first indigenous reserves. Fortune brightened for the Indians around the turn of the 20th century when Cândido Rondon, a man of both Portuguese and Bororo ancestry, and an explorer and progressive officer in the Brazilian army, began working to gain the Indians' trust and establish peace. Rondon, who had been assigned to help bring telegraph communications into the Amazon, was a curious and natural explorer. In 1910, he helped found the \"Serviço de Proteção aos Índios - SPI\" (Service for the Protection of Indians, today the FUNAI, or \"Fundação Nacional do Índio\", National Foundation for Indians). SPI was the first federal agency charged with protecting Indians and preserving their culture. In 1914, Rondon accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on Roosevelt's famous expedition to map the Amazon and discover new species. During these travels, Rondon was appalled to see how settlers and developers treated the indigenes, and he became their lifelong friend and protector.\n\nRondon, who died in 1958, is a national hero in Brazil. The Brazilian state of Rondônia is named after him.\n\nAfter Rondon's pioneering work, the SPI was turned over to bureaucrats and military officers and its work declined after 1957. The new officials did not share Rondon's deep commitment to the Indians. SPI sought to address tribal issues by transforming the tribes into mainstream Brazilian society. The lure of reservation riches enticed cattle ranchers and settlers to continue their assault on Indians lands – and the SPI eased the way. Between 1900 and 1967, an estimated 98 indigenous tribes were wiped out.\n\nMostly due to the efforts of the Villas-Bôas brothers, Brazil's first Indian reserve, the Xingu National Park, was established by the Federal Government in 1961.\n\nDuring the social and political upheaval in the 1960s, reports of mistreatment of Indians increasingly reached Brazil's urban centers and began to affect Brazilian thinking. In 1967, following the publication of the \"Figueiredo Report\", commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior, the military government launched an investigation into SPI. It soon came to light that the SPI was corrupt and failing to protect natives, their lands, and, culture. The 5,000-page report catalogued atrocities including slavery, sexual abuse, torture, and mass murder.\nIt has been charged that agency officials, in collaboration with land speculators, were systematically slaughtering the Indians by intentionally circulating disease-laced clothes. Criminal prosecutions followed, and the SPI was disbanded. The same year the government established Fundação Nacional do Índio (\"National Indian Foundation\"), known as FUNAI which is responsible for protecting the interests, cultures, and rights of the Brazilian indigenous populations.\nSome tribes have become significantly integrated into Brazilian society. The unacculturated tribes which have been contacted by FUNAI, are supposed to be protected and accommodated within Brazilian society in varying degrees. By 1987 it was recognized that unessential contact with the tribes was causing illness and social disintegration. The uncontacted tribes are now supposed to be protected from intrusion and interference in their life style and territory.\nHowever, the exploitation of rubber and other Amazonic natural resources has led to a new cycle of invasion, expulsion, massacres and death, which continues to this day.\n\nAlso in 1964, in a seismic political shift, the Brazilian military took control of the government and abolished all existing political parties, creating a two-party system. For the next two decades, Brazil was ruled by a series of generals. The country's mantra was \"Brazil, the Country of the Future,\" which the military government used as justification for a giant push into the Amazon to exploit its resources, thereby beginning to transform Brazil into one of the leading economies of the world. Construction began on a transcontinental highway across the Amazon basin, aimed to encourage migration to the Amazon and to open up the region to more trade. With funding from World Bank, thousands of square miles of forest were cleared without regard for reservation status. After the highway projects came giant hydroelectric projects, then swaths of forest were cleared for cattle ranches. As a result, reservation lands suffered massive deforestation and flooding. The public works projects attracted very few migrants, but those few – and largely poor - settlers brought new diseases that further devastated the Indians population.\n\nThe 1988 Brazilian Constitution recognises indigenous people' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their \"traditional lands\", which are demarcated as Indigenous Territories. In practice, however, Brazil's indigenous people still face a number of external threats and challenges to their continued existence and cultural heritage. The process of demarcation is slow—often involving protracted legal battles—and FUNAI do not have sufficient resources to enforce the legal protection on indigenous land. Since the 1980s there has been a boom in the exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest for mining, logging and cattle ranching, posing a severe threat to the region's indigenous population. Settlers illegally encroaching on indigenous land continue to destroy the environment necessary for indigenous people' traditional ways of life, provoke violent confrontations and spread disease. people such as the Akuntsu and Kanoê have been brought to the brink of extinction within the last three decades. On 13 November 2012, the national indigenous people association from Brazil APIB submitted to the United Nation a human rights document that complaints about new proposed laws in Brazil that would further undermine their rights if approved.\n\nMuch of the language has been incorporated into the official Brazilian Portuguese language. For example, 'Carioca' the word used to describe people born in the city of Rio de Janeiro, is from the indigenous word for 'house of the white (people)'.\n\nThe urban rights movement is a recent development in the rights of indigenous peoples. Brazil has one of the highest income inequalities in the world, and much of that population includes indigenous tribes migrating toward urban areas both by choice and by displacement. Beyond the urban rights movement, studies have shown that the suicide risk among the indigenous population is 8.1 times higher than the non-indigenous population.\n\nMany indigenous rights movements have been created through the meeting of many indigenous tribes in urban areas. For example, in Barcelos, an indigenous rights movement arose because of \"local migratory circulation.\" This is how many alliances form to create a stronger network for mobilization. Indigenous populations also living in urban areas have struggles regarding work. They are pressured into doing cheap labor. Programs like Oxfam have been used to help indigenous people gain partnerships to begin grassroots movements. Some of their projects overlap with environmental activism as well.\n\nMany Brazilian youths are mobilizing through the increased social contact, since some indigenous tribes stay isolated while others adapt to the change. Access to education also affects these youths, and therefore, more groups are mobilizing to fight for indigenous rights.\n\nMuch of Indigenous tribes' rights parallel the environmental and territorial rights movement. Although indigenous people have gained 21% of the Brazilian Amazon as part of indigenous land, there are many issues still today that affect the sustainability of Indigenous territories today. Environmentalists and indigenous peoples have been viewed as opponents to economic growth and barriers to development due to the fact that much of the land that indigenous tribes live on could be used for development projects and more industrialization. Currently, 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to forest clearing and degradation. Deforestation for mining also affects the daily lives of indigenous tribes in Brazil. The Munduruku Indians have higher levels of mercury poisoning due to gold production in the area. Climate change is one issue that indigenous tribes attribute as a reason to keep their territory.\n\nThere are a lot of alliances between indigenous peoples and conservation organizations in the Brazilian Amazon.The A'ukre Kayapo village and the Instituto SocioAmbiental (ISA) environmental organization is a good example of one of these alliances. They focus on environmental, education and developmental rights. For example, Amazon Watch collaborates with various indigenous organizations in Brazil to fight for both territorial and environmental rights. \"Access to natural resources by indigenous and peasant communities in Brazil has been considerably less and much more insecure,\" so activists focus on more traditional conservation efforts, and expanding territorial rights for indigenous people.\n\nTerritorial rights for the indigenous populations of Brazil largely fall under socio-economic issues. There have been violent conflicts regarding rights to land between the government and the indigenous population, and political rights have done little to stop them. There have been movements of the landless (MST) that helps keep land away from the elite living in Brazil.\n\nFor complete list see List of Indigenous people in Brazil\n\n"}

The Ingush are predominantly Sunni Muslims and speak the Ingush language, a Northeast Caucasian language that is closely related to Chechen; the two form a dialect continuum. The Ingush and Chechen peoples are collectively known as the Nakh peoples, although the genetics of Ingush and the Chechen indicate a split about 13,000-17,000 Ybp.\n\nCaucas is the legendary ancestor of the Vainakh (Chechen-Ingush).\nTheir name in Georgian is \"Ghlivi/Ghlighvi\". The ancient Greek author Strabo spoke about the \"Gargars\", while American cartographer Joseph Hutchins Colton labeled the people as \"Gelians\".\n\nThe Ingush came under Russian rule in 1810, but under Soviet rule during World War II they were suspected of collaborating with the Nazis and thus, the entire population was deported to the Kazakh and Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republics. The Ingush were rehabilitated in the 1950s, after the death of Joseph Stalin, and allowed to return home in 1957, though by that time western Ingush lands had been ceded to North Ossetia.\n\nThe Ingush possess a varied culture of traditions, legends, epics, tales, songs, proverbs, and sayings. Music, songs and dance are particularly highly regarded. Popular musical instruments include the \"dachick-panderr\" (a kind of balalaika), \"kekhat ponder\" (accordion, generally played by girls), mirz ponder (a three-stringed violin), zurna (a type of oboe), tambourine, and drums.\n\nThe Ingush are predominantly Sunni Muslims of the Shāfi‘ī Madh'hab, although a Sufi minority exists.\n\nAccording to one test by Nasidze in 2003 (analyzed further in 2004), the Y-chromosome structure of the Ingush greatly resembled that of neighboring Caucasian populations (especially Chechens, their linguistic and cultural brethren).\n\nThere has been only one notable study on the Ingush Y chromosome. These following statistics should not be regarded as final, as Nasidze's test had a notably low sample data for the Ingush. However, they do give an idea of the main haplogroups of the Ingush.\n\n\nIn the mtDNA, the Ingush formed a more clearly distinct population, with distance from other populations. The closest in an analysis by Nasidze were Chechens, Kabardins and Adyghe (Circassians), but these were all much closer to other populations than they were to the Ingush.\n\n\n"}

He was the lead attorney for Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of murder in July 2011 after a trial that attracted national and international attention. Baez authored a book with Peter Golenbock about the case, \"Presumed Guilty\", which became a New York Times Best Seller.\n\nBaez was born to Puerto Rican parents in Manhattan, N.Y., and raised in the Bronx, New York, and South Florida with his three sisters by his single mother. He attended Homestead High School in Florida, but dropped out in the ninth grade. He married and became a father at age 17. After earning his General Equivalency Diploma (GED), he joined the U.S. Navy in 1986. According to his resume, he spent three years assigned in connection with NATO at Norfolk, Virginia, trained as an intelligence analyst, and held a Top Secret security clearance.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy in 1989, Baez attended Miami-Dade Community College, then transferred to Florida State University where he earned a BA. He earned his Juris Doctor degree from St. Thomas University School of Law in 1997.\n\nAfter graduating from law school in 1997, Baez was denied admission to the Florida Bar due to financial irresponsibility.\n\nUnable to practice as an attorney, he worked instead as an intern at the Miami Dade Public Defender's office and owned several companies. In 2005, the Florida Board of Bar Examiners admitted Baez after he had demonstrated that he had rehabilitated himself.\n\nAfter being granted his license, he focused primarily on criminal defense cases, including the case of Elvira Garcia, an undocumented Mexican immigrant accused of kidnapping a child that she had adopted as her own. Garcia's charges were dropped, as it turned out to be more of a civil custody matter.\n\nHe also tried the first-degree murder case of Nilton Diaz, heavily covered by the media in Orlando and Puerto Rico because the victim was the 2-year-old granddaughter of World Boxing Champion Wilfredo Vazquez. Diaz was acquitted of first and second degree murder but convicted of manslaughter and child abuse.\n\nBaez came to significant national attention when he took on the case of Casey Anthony. Time Magazine dubbed it \"the Social Media Trial of the Century\". Anthony was acquitted of the murder of her daughter, Caylee, after a trial that lasted six weeks. In a press conference on the day of the verdict, Baez said, \"While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has been for the last three years has been always to make sure that there has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple.\" He added, \"And today our system of justice has not dishonored her memory by a false conviction.\" Baez was featured on every major news network and show across the country. Baez authored a book with Peter Golenbock about the Anthony Case, \"Presumed Guilty\", which was published on July 3, 2012 and became a New York Times Best Seller. Fox News Channel commentator Geraldo Rivera referred to Baez as \"Juanie Cochran.\"\n\nAfter representing Anthony, Baez was brought on to assist attorney Chris Lejuez in representing millionaire businessman Gary Giordano in Aruba. Giordano was detained in KIA Prison for 116 days in connection with the disappearance of Robyn Gardner. Aruba's High Court released Gary Giordano on November 28, 2011. No charges were ever filed against Gary Giordano. Baez and Lejuez successfully defended an appeal filed by Aruba's Chief Prosecutor, Taco Stein.\n\nBaez defended Giordano on the American reality prime time court show \"You the Jury\", which was canceled after two episodes. Baez also defended Gerod Roth in the show.\n\nIn 2012, George Zimmerman was arrested in the shooting death of 17‑year‑old Trayvon Martin. After jail calls that were released where George Zimmerman discussed Baez, Zimmerman's friend Frank Taaffe disclosed to HLN that a \"consortium\" wanted to hire Baez to represent George Zimmerman. Zimmerman chose Mark O'Mara. Ultimately, Baez ended up representing a lead detective in the case, Chris Serino.\n\nIn October 2013, Baez was hired to defend the 12‑year-old suspect arrested in connection with the death of 12‑year-old Rebecca Sedwick, whose mother had claimed was bullied to the point where she committed suicide by jumping to her death from a silo in a cement factory. The case made national news when Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd made the first arrest in the country for cyberbullying, and gave interviews on all major media shows including the \"Today Show\" and \"Good Morning America\". Baez criticized Sheriff Judd for releasing the juveniles names and photographs setting off a battle between the sheriff and defense attorney. Sheriff Judd told the media that Baez \"a flashy lawyer from out of town should go work out a plea deal.\" In the end, all charges against his client were dropped. After winning the case, Baez told Sheriff Judd that \"He should get a lawyer and a darn good one because he's gonna need it,\" indicating that his client may sue the Sheriff. No known further legal action occurred.\n\nBaez was working with Aaron Hernandez to appeal his conviction for the murder of Odin Lloyd up until Hernandez's apparent suicide on April 19, 2017. Baez has stated publicly that he does not believe that Hernandez committed suicide and is \"determined to find the truth surrounding his untimely death\" as \"Aaron was looking forward to an opportunity for a second chance to prove his innocence.\" \n\nBaez defended Aaron Hernandez on charges related to a 2012 Boston double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in a drive-by shooting in Boston's South End on July 16, 2012. On April 14, 2017, a jury cleared Hernandez of committing the murders. \nHernandez was already serving a life term without parole for that killing. Five days after the not guilty verdict, Hernandez committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell.\n\nOn September 21, 2017, Baez announced Aaron Hernandez was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy by Dr. Ann McKee of Boston University, and that he had filed a federal lawsuit, on behalf of Hernandez' daughter, against the National Football League and the New England Patriots, seeking unspecified damages for loss of parental support. The suit alleges the league and team were aware of the dangers of repeated head injuries and refused to disclose these to Hernandez.\n\nIn June 2017, Benjamin Shaw was on vacation in Shreveport LA., when he walked into a bar called the Rockin Rodeo during which time he got into a verbal altercation which was eventually taken outside to the parking lot.

It was recorded at the same time as their first LP in the UK, \"Three Imaginary Boys\" (1979), but not included on the album. However, it was included on the band's first US album, \"Boys Don't Cry\" (1980).\n\nThis song lends two of its lines to the titles of one of The Cure's compilation albums, \"Standing on a Beach\", and to its CD/video counterpart \"Staring at the Sea\".\n\nComposer Robert Smith has said that the song \"was a short poetic attempt at condensing my impression of the key moments in \"L'Étranger\" (\"The Stranger\") by Albert Camus\". The lyrics describe a shooting on a beach, in which the Arab of the title is killed by the song's narrator; in Camus' story the protagonist, Meursault, shoots an Arab on a beach, overwhelmed by his surroundings. Meursault is condemned for his honesty about his feelings. He is considered an outsider (or \"stranger\") because \"he refuses to lie\" and \"doesn't play the game\".\n\nUpon release, \"Melody Maker\" compared the song to \"Hong Kong Garden\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees. Music critic Ian Birch wrote: \"As 'Hong Kong Garden' used a simple Oriental-styled riff to striking effect, so '[Killing An] Arab' conjures up edginess through a Moorish-flavour guitar pattern\".\n\nThe track has a controversial history, since it has often been viewed as promoting violence against Arabs. In the US, The Cure's first compilation of singles, \"Standing on a Beach\" (1986), was packaged with a sticker advising against racist usage of the song. Smith and Elektra requested that radio stations discontinue airing the song and saw the sticker as a compromise to prevent having to pull the album from sale entirely. It saw controversy again during the Persian Gulf War and following the September 11 attacks. \"Killing an Arab\" was the only single from the \"Three Imaginary Boys\" era not to be included on that album's 2004 remaster although it remains available on the albums \"Boys Don't Cry\" and \"Standing on a Beach\".\n\nThe song was revived in 2005, when the band performed the song at several European festivals. The lyrics, however, were changed from \"Killing an Arab\" to \"Kissing an Arab\". Smith added a whole new opening verse when the band performed it at the Royal Albert Hall, London on 1 April 2006 as \"Killing Another\". The \"killing another\" lyric was also used during the 2007-2008 4Tour. The band performed the song as \"Killing an Ahab\" with lyrics inspired by Herman Melville on 2011's \"Reflections\" tour.\n\nDuring live performances, the song is notably played with more energy making the song sound somewhat more anarchic and aggressive than originally recorded.\n\n\"Killing an Arab\" has been covered by Frodus on the 1995 Radiopaque compilation \"Give Me The Cure\", and again in 2004 by DJ Riton. Also, the Electric Hellfire Club copied it on their 2000 Cleopatra Records compilation \"Empathy for the Devil\". Santigold covered the song at Lollapalooza. NYC band the Reign Released a cover of it as a single in 2014 on (F.R.O.G Records) The Australian band Turpentine also covered the song as a B-Side to their single \"Filthy Little Pervert\" in protest of the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\n\n7\" single\n\n"}

Rice, 275 U.S. 78 (1927), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the exclusion on account of race of a child of Chinese ancestry from a state high school did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision effectively approved the exclusion of minority children from schools reserved for whites.\n\nIn 1924, a nine-year-old Chinese-American named Martha Lum, daughter of Gong Lum, was prohibited from attending the Rosedale Consolidated High School of the Rosedale Consolidated School District in Bolivar County, Mississippi solely because she was of Chinese descent. There was no school in the district maintained for Chinese students, and she was forced by compulsory attendance laws to attend school.\n\nA lower court granted the plaintiff's request of a writ of mandamus to force the members of the Board of Trustees to admit Martha Lum. Gong Lum's case was not that racial discrimination as such was illegal but that his daughter, being Chinese, had incorrectly been classified as \"colored\" by the authorities.\n\nSince the ruling went against them, the Board of Trustees became the plaintiff, and Lum was named the defendant in the case \"Rice v. Gong Lum\", which was heard in the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and allowed the Board of Trustees to exclude Martha Lum from the school for white children. Gong Lum appealed the state Supreme Court's ruling to the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn an opinion written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the US Supreme Court affirmed the Mississippi supreme court's ruling and thus the position of the Board of Trustees. In the unanimous opinion, Taft held that the petitioner had not shown that there were no segregated schools accessible for the education of Martha Lum in Mississippi:\n\nWe must assume, then, that there are school districts for colored children in Bolivar county, but that no colored school is within the limits of the Rosedale consolidated high school district. This is not inconsistent with there being at a place outside of that district and in a different district, a colored school which the plaintiff Martha Lum may conveniently attend.\n\nTaft further stated that given the accessibility of segregated schools, the question then was whether a person of Chinese ancestry, born in and a citizen of the United States, was denied equal protection of the law by being given the opportunity to attend a school that received \"only children of the brown, yellow or black races.\" In reference to \"Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education\", Taft concluded that the \"right and power of the state to regulate the method of providing for the education of its youth at public expense is clear.\" Additionally, Taft pointed to a number of federal and state court decisions, most prominently \"Plessy v. Ferguson\", all of which had upheld segregation in the public sphere and particularly in the realm of public education. Accordingly, Taft concluded:\n\nMost of the cases cited arose, it is true, over the establishment of separate schools as between white pupils and black pupils; but we cannot think that the question is any different, or that any different result can be reached, assuming the cases above cited to be rightly decided, where the issue is as between white pupils and the pupils of the yellow races. The decision is within the discretion of the state in regulating its public schools, and does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe judgement of the Mississippi Supreme Court was affirmed. Martha Lum was not allowed to go to the school for white children.\n\n\"Lum\" was effectively overruled by the Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), which outlawed segregation in public schools. However, an important part of the decision still stands. The power of the state to make racial distinctions in its school system, and to determine the race of its students, has not been overturned because it was not an issue in \"Brown v. Board of Education\".\n\n\n"}

It is essentially magical-religious in nature, believing disease to be caused by supernatural factors such as spells and curable by treatments based on rituals, thermal waters and herbs. Knowledge of medicinal herbs is one of the best-known elements of Mapuche medicine and is still used today.,\nOne of the most striking aspects of historical Mapuche medicine was the use of surgery as a treatment, which was developed to treat wounds and traumas suffered in the frequent battles between tribes. Fractures and dislocations of bones were treated by immobilising and covering the limbs with pastes and ointments made of medicinal herbs.\nAs in Europe, the practice of the bloodletting was also commonplace and used as a treatment for many conditions. In Mapuche culture, it was done by making small cuts with a very sharp stone called a \"guincubue\" to draw blood, then covering the cut with an astringent or herbal mix. Bloodletting was also used by parents on children to make them lighter, more agile and more capable of working and fighting, as it was thought that their blood was salty and heavy.\nHygiene was very important in Mapuche life. They were very clean and tidy, bathing every day in nearby streams or rivers, regardless of weather conditions. The bark of the Quillaja tree, which is very common in the local area, was used as soap (and is still used today in some commercial beauty products).\n\nThe Mapuche people came about as the result of the mingling of two cultures: the Moluche people, from what today is Argentina’s Pampa, with the indigenous inhabitants of the region between the Toltén and Bío Bío rivers in Chile.\nThe Mapuche had no written language and their knowledge was transmitted orally. Most of their traditions and culture, including their medical knowledge, were documented for the first time by the European conquistadors.\n\nThere were three main categories of doctors or healers in Mapuche medicine: the vileus, the ampiver and the machis.\n\nIf a patient did not recover from any of these methods, the last resort was the performance of a magic ritual called \"Machitún\". Machis also served as advisors and oracles for their community.\n\nIf a machi had tried all conventional treatments without success a machitún ceremony would be tried, where the machi communicates with the spiritual world in order to find a diagnosis and a cure.\nFor the machitún, the machi places a bunch of laurel leaves with some canelo tree leaves in the centre in the corner of a small hut called a ruka [es:ruca |(ruca)], and prepares a goat for sacrifice there. Women sang mournful songs while the machi spread tobacco smoke through the room and got ready to sacrifice the animal.\nThe goat’s heart was cut out and placed it in the canelo leaves, and then the machi simulated penetrating the patient’s abdomen in a search of the \"magic poison\". Finally, the machi played the cultrún and fell in a trance where the spirits would tell him how to treat the patient.\nOn occasion, the three kinds of doctors would meet to solve a problem in a meeting called a \"Thauman\".\nApart from the three kinds of doctors previously mentioned, there were two further kinds of surgeons. The cupove was a pathologist who would examine corpses to determine the disease and cause of death and the gutave was a surgeon expert at treating wounds, ulcers and many kinds of wounds.\n\nThere are several government programs today which aim to integrate traditional mapuche medicine with Western medicine. They look to incorporate the cultural aspects of Mapuche medicine into modern Western techniques and in this way facilitate bringing modern techniques into Mapuche communities. Examples include the \"Programa de Salud Mapuche\" (Mapuche Health Program) and the \"Mesa Local (PROMAP)\" (PROMAP Local Board). The latter aims specifically to incorporate Mapuche views on health and environmental issues into its work.\n\n"}

These people were members of the hereditary nobility and occupied positions in the government as ambassadors and ministers, the army and the priesthood. The subclasses within the \"Pipiltzin\" were: tlahtohcapilli (a tlahtoani's son), tecpilli or teucpilli (a teucli's son), tlazohpilli (son of legitimate wife), and calpanpilli (son of a concubine).\n\nChildren of the \"Pipiltzin\" were given extensive education in preparation for the role they will play in their adult life. They were sent to the \"calmecac\", which was the center for higher learning, to study the ancient wisdom as well as \"elegant forms of speech, ancient hymns, poems and historical accounts, religious doctrines, the calendar, astronomy, astrology, legal precepts and the art of the government.\" The \"Pipiltzin,\" however, helped increase social stresses which attributed to internal weaknesses that led to the Aztec Empire's downfall.\n\nAs the Aztecs began settling what would later become their homelands, an elite emerged (the \"Pipiltzin\") that claimed descent from the Toltecs, the former empire of Central Mexico. The new hereditary elite unified the clans that had been the center of Aztec life and paved the way for a conquest empire.

The community of Russian subjects/citizens in Korea has historically included not just ethnic Russians, but members of minority groups of Russia as well, such as Tatars, Poles, and, more recently, return migrants from among the \"Koryo-saram\" (ethnic Koreans whose ancestors migrated to the Russian Far East in the late 19th century) and Sakhalin Koreans.\n\nThe earliest Russian subject in Korea is believed to have been Afanasy Ivanovich Seredin-Sabatin (Афанасий Иванович Середин-Сабатин), an architect from a family of Swiss origin; he was invited to Korea from Tianjin, China in 1884 by King Gojong. Karl Ivanovich Weber became the Russian Empire's official representative in Seoul in April 1885. With the establishment of formal relations, more Russians began migrating into Korea throughout the 1890s, largely via Manchuria. At that time, the community was centred on the Russian legation, opened in 1890, and the Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Nicholas, opened in 1903, both located in Seoul's Jeongdong (located in present-day Jung-gu). The Russian community in these days was composed largely of missionaries, diplomats, and businessmen; Russia played an important role in the Korean politics of the era, and at one point, Gojong actually lived in the Russian compound, in fear of his life after the 1895 assassination of his wife Queen Min. However, with Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War, Russian influence in Korea began to wane.\n\nThe 1922 influx of Russian refugees from the fall of Vladivostok to the Red Army would completely change the face of the community. In October of that year, more than 15,000 refugees landed at Wonsan, Kangwon-do. Roughly half were quickly able to obtain onward passage to Shanghai, but the refugees who had not taken valuables with them when fleeing Vladivostok were stuck in Wonsan for the winter; they relied on charitable donations and day labour for their survival. According to William Arthur Noble, an American missionary in Korea, no more than 20% were literate; they lived either on overcrowded ships, or in barely heated customs warehouses at the docks. In the spring of 1923, the refugees began to disperse, moving on to Harbin, where there was a significant community of Russians, or even to overseas destinations in Latin America.\n\nIn February 1925, Japan finally recognised the Soviet Union, and handed over the old Russian Legation building to the new Soviet ambassador. By the late 1920s, there were only around a hundred Russians living in Seoul; former nobles and officials lived in Jeongdong, while a community of Tatars lived and worked in the markets near Namdaemun and Honmachi (modern-day Myeongdong). However, due to class divisions within the community, the two groups had little interaction with each other. George Yankovsky, the grandson of a Polish noble exiled to Siberia, also maintained a resort in Chongjin which was popular among the Russian communities of East Asia, but virtually unknown to other westerners; when the Soviets invaded North Korea, most of the Russians still living there were arrested and forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union.\n\nNew Russian communities have formed in various cities in South Korea. In Seoul, a \"Little Russia\" began to form in Jung-gu's Gwanghui-dong, near Dongdaemun, in the late 1980s. Roughly 50,000 people from post-Soviet states were estimated to live in the area in 2004, down from 70,000 several years previously due to deportations of illegal immigrants. In Busan, Russians are concentrated in the former \"Texas Town\" in Jung-gu's Jungang-dong; roughly 200 are estimated to live in the city permanently, with several hundred more on short-term visas, along with a large transient population of Russian sailors.\n\nAfter the Korean War (1950-1953), South Koreans were unfavorably disposed towards Russia because of its alliance with North Korea. Korean Orthodox believers did not want to have any relations with the Russian Orthodox Church. As a result, the Orthodox Community of South Korea found itself cut off from the rest of the Orthodox Church; that is the community did not belonging to any ecclesiastical jurisdiction.\n\nThis very serious ecclesiological problem was resolved as follows; On 25 December 1955, after the Christmas Divine Liturgy, the General Assembly of the Orthodox Community of South Korea unanimously decided to request to come under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Ecumenical Patriarchate accepted the request and, since then, the Korean Orthodox Church has remained a metropolis of the See of Constantinople.\n\nAfter the collapse of the communist regime in Russia and the Balkans in the 1990s, the first economic immigrants from Orthodox countries began to arrive in South Korea. Many of them, being strangers among strangers, were interested in finding an Orthodox church. From the beginning, they found refuge and support in the arms of the Korean Orthodox Church. The then Metropolitan Sotirios Trambas of Korea embraced them all with his love and paternal affection and slowly created the first nucleus of Slavic-speaking Orthodox faithful. He himself learned how to celebrate the Divine Liturgy in Slavonic and since 1992 in Seoul (in the chapel of the Dormition) or at the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Kapeong, where the pilgrims spent many weekend, he celebrated the Divine Liturgy for them. He also held special services for Slavic-speakers on Christmas Day and other Feast days with the old Calendar in order to give them a sense of familiarity and belonging. In 1995, during his historic first official visit to Korea, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew laid the foundation stone of the chapel of Saint Maximus the Greek.\n\nSince then the Orthodox Metropolis of Korea has undertaken the responsibility and pastoral care of all the Orthodox residing in the country as well as those who are temporary visitors and workers, such as sailors and entrepreneurs. In other words, all Orthodox believers of various nationalities (Koreans, Russians, Greeks, etc.) are “under the omophoron,” or spiritual jurisdiction and care, of the Ecumenical Patriarch. In order to provide proper pastoral care to all Orthodox in Korea, apart from the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Seoul, there is also the Chapel of St. Maximus the Greek, in which the Services and the Divine Liturgy are celebrated in Slavonic for Slavic-speakers, and occasionally in English for English speakers. Also, in the church of the Annunciation in the Busan, the chapel of Saint George is used for the celebration of the Divine Liturgy in Slavonic for Slavic-speakers who reside in and near Busan.\n\nRussians in Pyongyang have sometimes been served by Orthodox clergy sent from Vladivostok since 2002. The Church of the Life-Giving Trinity in Pyongyang was dedicated in 2006. It was built at the order of Kim Jong-il after his visit to the church of Innocent of Irkutsk in Khabarovsk.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The tribe is present in different parts of Pakistan. In Pakistan, the tribe lives in Swat, Upper Dir, Lower Dir, Bajour, Buner, Shangla, Malakand District, Dargai, Sakha Koat,Shodag, Charsadda (Hashtnagar).\n\nAccording to Khan Roshan Khan, in his book about Pashtun's history \"Tazkira\" at page-379/380 ,\"Shalmanis(Shilmanis) are \"Banu Bakhtar\"(بنو بختر) who were living in an area \"Shalman\" in Syria.These Banu Bakhtar were the land lords of areas like Shalman(شلمان), Ainab(عيناب) and Baiswad(بيسود) in Syria. \n\nSimilar to Shalman of Khyber, a city by name Shalman is also present in Gilan Province of Iran, and the fourth largest river in Iran is also named as Shalman. . These landmarks with synonym Shalman suggest that this tribe could have moved from Syria through Iran (Gilan Shalman) to current Shalman Valley in Khyber Agency near Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.\n\nKhan Roshan Khan a Pakhtun historian says that Shalmani were originally brought to Swat District by one of the famous conquerors and kings, Muhammad of Ghor, from Shalman Valley of khyber Agency in present Pakistan and Karman of today's Afghanistan. \n\nM.Saida Khan Shinwari states in his book that, Shilmani are Ghoryakhel tribe divided as Shamsher Khel, Halimzai and Kam Shilmanis and considers them to be Mohmand. He states that Shamsher Khels are related to Morcha Khel Mohmands, Halimzai to Halimzai Mohmands and Kam Shilmanis to Tarakzai Mohmands. Officially the Shilmanis are treated as a separate tribe since the Khyber Agreement of 1881. The Shilmanis are closer to Mohmands in characteristics and based on historical evidence they appear to be close kinsmen of the Mohmand.\n\nShalmani are called as \"Shalmani Momands\" by Harold Carmichael Wylly, at page-317 in his book \"From the Black Mountain to Waziristan\". \n\nSuleman Shahid suggests In his book, that Shilmani were the strongest tribe among other Pashtun tribes. Primarily they were under Swat District state and Swati King by name Sultan Pakal, but later on Mir Hinda, who was a combatant leader, occupied Hashtnagar and announced it as \"Hashtnagar State of Shalmanis\".\n\nIt is assumed by some local historians that, after centuries when Yusufzai exiled by Mughal Empire from Afghanistan, So Yusufzai tribe attacked on Shilmani tribe and took Charsada Hashtnagar from them with support of Dilazak and other allied tribes of Yusufzai and later gave to Muhammadzai (Charsadda) son of Zamand tribe. Muhammadzai were Yusufzai allies in the battle of Bajawar against the Ghoryakhel tribe and Shalmanis are sub-tribe of Momand Ghoryakhel, therefore Muhammadzai were awarded with Hashtnagar by Yusufzai after the conquest of Bajawar . Shalmani were very strong and it was unable to defeat them, in the Hashtnagar battle and it was ended after two years.\n\nHowever this local story seems to be invalid as the ancient Skha Koat landlords are still living since centuries there and this is the evidence of no foreign invasion over Shalmani tribe in Hashtnagar. If so, then in addition to Skha Koat the Shilmani of Mandani (Charsaddah), Naguman (charsaddah) and Turlandai (Nowshera) would not exist today in there villages and lands. \n\nWhen Pakistan had not yet come into being, Bacha Khan Shalmani of Sakha Kot Malakand Agency, was the prominent figure of the Shalmani tribe and was a politician. Mr. Naek Amal Khan Shalmani and Rahat Khan Shalmani belong to the family of Bacha Khan.\n\n"}

Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court case that sanctioned the imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were at least 16 years of age at the time of the crime. This decision came one year after \"Thompson v. Oklahoma\", in which the Court had held that a 15-year-old offender could not be executed because to do so would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In 2003, the Governor of Kentucky Paul E. Patton commuted the death sentence of Kevin Stanford, an action followed by the Supreme Court two years later in \"Roper v. Simmons\" overruling \"Stanford\" and holding that all juvenile offenders are exempt from the death penalty.\n\nThe case involved the shooting death of 20-year-old Barbel Poore in Jefferson County, Kentucky. Kevin Stanford committed the murder on January 7, 1981, when he was approximately 17 years and 4 months of age. Stanford and his accomplice repeatedly raped and sodomized Poore during and after their commission of a robbery at a gas station where she worked as an attendant. They then drove her to a secluded area near the station, where Stanford shot her pointblank in the face and then in the back of her head. The proceeds from the robbery were roughly 300 cartons of cigarettes, two gallons of fuel, and a small amount of cash.\n\nAfter Stanford's arrest, a Kentucky juvenile court conducted hearings to determine whether he should be transferred for trial as an adult, and, stressing the seriousness of his offenses and his long history of past delinquency, found that certification for trial as an adult to be in the best interest of Stanford and the community.\n\nStanford was convicted of murder, first-degree sodomy, first-degree robbery, and receiving stolen property, and was sentenced to death and 45 years in prison. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, rejecting Stanford's \"deman[d] that he has a constitutional right to treatment.\" Finding that the record clearly demonstrated that \"there was no program or treatment appropriate for the appellant in the juvenile justice system,\" the court held that the juvenile court did not err in certifying Stanford for trial as an adult. The court also stated that Stanford's \"age and the possibility that he might be rehabilitated were mitigating factors appropriately left to the consideration of the jury that tried him.\"\n\nOral arguments were heard 27 March 1989. Prior to the hearing, briefs of amici curiae pushing for reversal were filed by the American Baptist Churches, the Child Welfare League of America, and the West Virginia Council of Churches. Briefs supporting the affirmation of the capital sentence were filed by the Attorney General of Kentucky and a number of attorneys general from other states.\n\nIn both cases, briefs of amici curiae were put forth by the American Bar Association, the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry, the International Human Rights Group, and Amnesty International.\n\nArguments in the defense of petitioners Stanford and Wilkins (see below) were that the application of capital punishment upon defendants who were minors at the time of the offense was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nIn both \"Stanford v. Kentucky\", and the parallel case \"Wilkins v. Missouri\", the Supreme Court affirmed the capital punishments handed down in lower courts. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that neither Stanford or Wilkins asserted that the punishment was cruel or unusual at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted (common law at the time set the incapacity to commit a felony at age 14), and so both petitioners were left to argue that capital punishment for minors older than 14, was contrary to \"the evolving standards of decency\". This expanse in the review of the Eighth Amendment was not granted in this decision, and Scalia went on to cite precedent limits set in \"Gregg v. Georgia\" (1976).\n\nWe discern neither a historical nor a modern societal consensus forbidding the imposition of capital punishment on any person who murders at 16 or 17 years of age. Accordingly, we conclude that such punishment does not offend the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. [...] and to mean that as the dissent means it, i.e., that it is for \"us\" to judge, not on the basis of what we perceive the Eighth Amendment originally prohibited, or on the basis of what we perceive the society through its democratic processes now overwhelmingly disapproves, but on the basis of what we think \"proportionate\" and \"measurably contributory to acceptable goals of punishment\" -- to say and mean that, is to replace judges of the law with a committee of philosopher-kings.\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, although agreeing that no national consensus forbade the imposition of capital punishment on 16- or 17-year-old murderers, concluded that the court has a constitutional obligation to conduct proportionality analysis, (citing \"Penry v. Lynaugh\") and should consider age-based statutory classifications that are relevant to that analysis.\n\nJustice Brennan filed a dissenting opinion, in which he was joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens.\n\n"}

{"id": "18555852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18555852", "title": "Supermarket shortage", "text": "Supermarket shortage\n\nSupermarket shortages have been identified in many American urban neighborhoods, and such gaps in food access have been closely correlated with diet-related diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes.\nThe shortage began when many supermarkets left mixed-income central city neighborhoods after civil disturbances in the late 1960s and 1970s. By 1984, store openings exceeded closings nationally but the opposite held in cities and the trend continues. The reluctance of large chains to open in urban areas is termed by some activists, \"supermarket redlining.\" A second study that controlled for population and percent African American found that supermarkets in 1970 were preferred to locate in urban areas with high poverty and low income. Afterward, this trend gradually reversed direction until 1990.\n\nStudies suggest that 21 of America's largest cities experience a grocery gap characterized by fewer stores and less square footage per store. The poorest neighborhoods typically have about 55% of the grocery square footage of the best-off neighborhoods. The migration of supermarkets to the suburbs contribute to the creation of so-called food deserts. Simultaneously, there is a lower prevalence of independently owned grocery stores in low-wealth and predominantly black neighborhoods and a greater proportion of households without access to private transportation in these neighborhoods.\n\nSupermarkets generally provide food at cheaper prices than the bodegas and pharmacies that service inner-city areas. A study that compared supermarkets, neighborhood groceries, convenience stores, and health food stores in San Diego, California found that supermarkets had twice the average number of 'heart-healthy' foods compared to neighborhood grocery stores and four times the average number of such foods compared to convenience stores. Therefore, less supermarkets can mean less easy access to healthy foods, high prices for healthy foods that are available at smaller stores and health problems that result from a consequent unhealthy diet.\n\nGrocery stores typically have only 1-2% profit margins, so the difficulties involved in running an urban supermarket are often seen as too costly in an already-risky business. A combination of other factors make urban neighborhoods seem less-than-ideal for grocery store executives.\n\nUrban stores in low-income neighborhoods generally have less demand for the profitable luxury goods that are more popular in suburban stores. Also, people who shop with food stamps usually buy fewer nonperishable items like toiletries and impulse items, the things that bring stores their highest profits.\n\nInstead, urban stores must stock a variety of lower-volume items geared to multiethnic tastes. Compounding the problem, chain stores are generally unfamiliar with ethnic preferences. Chains tend to develop a formula that works for their core market, which consists of middle-class, white suburbanites.\n\nOne obstacle to supermarket growth is that developers tend to overlook the market potential of urban communities. Underserved, urban neighborhoods tend to be composed of populations with lower incomes on average, but the density of an urban environment also means that city neighborhoods tend to have more income per acre than suburban areas. Studies by the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City in Boston found that \"nearly 8 million people who live in the nation's poorest urban communities have a combined $85 billion in retail spending power, which is far greater than all of Mexico.\"\n\nPrejudices have biased marketing research and prevented supermarkets from seeing the potential of urban locations. National marketing firms have provided grocery store executives with statistics derived from flawed modeling techniques. These statistics include erroneous information about population decline, the perpetuation of stereotypes about the people who live in urban communities, and miscalculated income information.\n\nMeanwhile, media portray urban areas as poor and dependent, contributing to supermarket executives' skepticism. In fact, urban areas usually consist overwhelmingly of working households with a substantial share of middle-income people.\n\nA problem in urban and suburban stores alike, shoplifting is 6% to 8% of supermarket revenues. Fear of crime also acts as a big deterrent for investors, but some cities interested in developing new grocery stores have placed police stations near development sites in order to allay developers' fears.\n\nThe expense and scarcity of land in urban environments pose some of the greatest problems for supermarket developers. Finding sites for urban development also involves fees, complexity, length, and unpredictability.\n\nToday's suburban supermarket model requires more space than older, urban facilities can accommodate, meaning that urban supermarket development often requires the construction of new facilities. And, while suburban supermarkets are typically , urban supermarkets are only on average. This means that urban supermarkets can sell significantly fewer products than suburban stores, which contributes to fewer profits.\n\nA grocery store's 24-hour lighting \"does a lot for the sense of safety and community in the neighborhood,\" because supermarkets can be a safe haven. Citizens feel a \"dramatic change in atmosphere,\" after new supermarkets are built.\n\nIn addition, new supermarkets can be used as location of community programs—health exams, nutritional education, eye exams, voter registration, birthdays for children, Western Union wire transfers so immigrants can wire remittances, selling event tickets, having Driver’s License renewal facilities, and providing phones for discount international calls. Besides contributing to a community’s overall well-being, such services make a grocery store more appealing to urban consumers: developing the services that urban citizens desire is a crucial way to make new supermarket development work.\n\nBy engaging with local organizations, supermarkets can create a link with a community that will contribute to security, reduction in shrinkage, and provide for better selection and effectiveness of employees. Organizations (such as churches) can help in hiring decisions, and security guards can come from the community. These make security more effective, bring jobs to communities, and make customers brand-loyal. Grocery should also confer with local religious officials about religious diets.\n\nStores should also keep in mind the shopping habits of urban consumers, who often rely on monies distributed to them at the beginning of each month. Stores may want to \"staff to accommodate strong demand in the first two weeks of the month, slack purchases in the last week, and heavier traffic that purchases less per customer in general,\" according to the shopping habits of urban consumers.\n\nGrocery stores should consider developing diversity departments within supermarket administration to identify minority-owned suppliers and potential employees.\n\nRacial and wealth segregation remain prominent characteristics of US neighborhoods.. Studies suggest that predominantly black neighborhoods suffer from a greater lack of access to healthy food, although this was not always the case.\n\nOf 216 US census tracts studied, the ratio of supermarkets to residents for predominantly white areas is 1:3816 versus 1:23,582 for predominantly black neighborhoods. Only 8% of black Americans lived in a census tract with at least one supermarket; 31% of Whites live in a census tract with at least one supermarket. In fact, aside from region and economic health, studies find that proportion of blacks in the population can affect an area's likelihood of having a supermarket.\n\nMany cities and states across the US have recognized the urban supermarket gap problem and have developed plans to address the issue of food access. Additionally, the U.S. federal government established the Healthy Food Financing Initiative. The initiative provided more than $400 million in funding from the Treasury Department, USDA and Department of Health and Human Services to promote expanding access to nutritious foods, including developing and equipping grocery stores and other small retailers to sell healthful food in low-income rural and urban communities that currently lack this option.\n\nIn April 2003, Pennsylvania passed the nation's first statewide economic development initiative aimed at improving access to markets that sell healthy food in underserved rural and urban communities. The legislation devoted $100 million to agriculture projects, including the development of grocery stores and farmers' markets, and $40 million to support the development of 10 new stores in underserved communities across Pennsylvania.\n\nThe resulting Fresh Food Financing Initiative was a public-private partnership in association with The Food Trust started in 2004 with state seed funds. The program encouraged the development of new supermarkets by providing grants of up to $250,000 or loans of up to $2.5 million per store to defray the infrastructure costs of developing a new store. Up to 2009, $41.8 million in grants and loans have funded 58 stores. Success of the initiative led to the creation of similar programs in at least seven states and cities, like the New York City Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program.\n\nLike many other cities in the US, New York City faces a supermarket shortage that is closely linked to health epidemics. At the request of the Mayor’s office, the Department of City Planning studied supermarket need in the city and, in April 2008, found a widespread shortage of supermarkets. This shortage causes a lack of healthy, fair-priced food options for many New Yorkers who live in a food desert. Food access issues are partly responsible for the facts that diabetes now affects over 700,000 people in New York City, over 1.1 million New Yorkers are obese, and another 2 million are overweight.\n\nHealth problems are especially prevalent in minority communities, and statistics indicate a racial dimension to the crisis: Supermarkets in Harlem are 30% less common than on the Upper East Side, and while 20% of Upper East Side bodegas carried leafy green vegetables, only 3% of those in Harlem could say the same.\n\nThree million New Yorkers live in neighborhoods with high need for grocery stores and supermarkets. Neighborhoods such as Central and Spanish Harlem and Washington Heights in Manhattan; Bushwick, Bedford Stuyvesant, East New York and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; Corona, Jamaica and Far Rockaway in Queens; areas of the South Bronx, Williamsbridge/Wakefield and portions of Pelham Parkway in the Bronx; and St. George and Stapleton in Staten Island show the greatest need for full-line supermarkets.\n\nIn February, 2008, Speaker Christine Quinn of the City Council announced the creation of a Statewide Supermarket Commission to identify state and local policy solutions to encourage new supermarket development and prevent supermarkets from closing. The Commission was led by the Food Trust and the Food Bank for New York City, in partnership with the City’s Food Policy Coordinator and the Food Industry Alliance. Simultaneously, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500, which represents grocery store workers, is working to create healthy food options for all New Yorkers through supermarkets, Community-supported agriculture, urban agriculture, and farmers' markets.\n\nThe FRESH program attempts to increase access to full-service grocery stores in designated \"underserved\" areas with help in zoning incentives, abatements of land and building taxes for 25 years and other tax subsidies such as sales tax exemptions on building materials.\n\nIn Oakland's flatlands, the development of low-income communities, lowered real estate values, zoning restrictions, land parcel sizes and property taxes discouraged supermarkets and other full-service food retailers. Corner stores, convenience stores and liquor stores took root where commercial parcels were too small to accommodate a grocery store. Overall, supermarket penetration largely drove down the number of grocery stores in West Oakland from 137 in 1960 to 22 in 1980. By the 1990s, many supermarkets in the flatlands also closed their doors to invest in more profitable areas.\n\nBy 2005, The California Endowment and its then-$26 million initiative California FreshWorks set out to increase availability of healthy food options by investing in grocery stores in low-income and minority communities. As of 2014, about $264 million had been raised from a variety of investors.\n\nThe Illinois Fresh Food begun with a $10 million state grant was set up to finance full-service grocery stores in neighborhoods with little access to fresh foods.\n\nChicago's Retail Chicago Program is outreach program for retailers, brokers, and developers to introduce them to the many community retail development opportunities in Chicago and expedite their entry into these new markets by serving as a \"One Stop Shop\" to assist them during their site selection process.\n\nSimilar programs created after Pennsylvania's initiative include the New Jersey Food Access Initiative and Colorado Fresh Food Financing Fund ad at the city level with New Orleans Fresh Food Retailer Initiative and Cincinnati Fresh Food Financing Fund.\n\nBesides causing a lack of access to healthy foods, the urban supermarket gap also means that inner city neighborhoods lack the jobs and tax revenues that grocery stores provide.\n\nWhere supermarket developers have neglected some urban neighborhoods, city governments and non-profits can work together to market the potential of inner city areas to grocery store executives. Chicago’s planning department provided an information guide with a database of suitable land parcels to executives at a grocers’ expo in 2005.\n\nMany of Oakland’s existing food retail businesses are located within Redevelopment Areas, allowing them to qualify for redevelopment fund assistance. The Food Systems Assessment Report for Oakland suggested the creation of Food Retail Enterprise Zones, whereby food retailers that provide nutritious foods in poor neighborhoods are exempt from Oakland business taxes. It also suggested programs, like the Green Business certification program could award “Green and Healthy Oakland” certification to retail establishments that stock food or offer menu items conforming to specific criteria (fresh, nutritious, local, etc.) \n\nMarket leaders close urban stores, even if they are showing a profit, to focus on the most productive stores in the suburbs. But \"operators in second and third place in a metro area may seek to expand their core clientele outside the highly contested, white suburbs to other areas and groups, such as the mixed-income neighborhoods and ethnic clients in the central city.\" Baltimore initially attracted \"low-level\" chains and \"now, upscale, full-service stores wants to locate in areas they had previous ignored.\"\n\nExecutives’ fears of security costs may be easily abated: Rochester clinched the deal with a Tops supermarket by offering to locate a police station at the development site. Hiring locals as security guards helps decrease security issues and losses to shrinkage.\n\nDespite the widespread efforts to address supermarket shortages and food deserts, not all researchers are convinced that such areas are common. At least one medical review and a later government report have suggested that food deserts are relatively rare. Nevertheless, their purported existence continues to drive significant public health expenditures.\n"}

It is the most widely spoken variety of Romansh with 17,897 people within the Surselva District (54.8%) naming Romansh as a habitually spoken language in the Swiss census of 2000. The most closely related variety is Sutsilvan, which is spoken in the area located to the east of the district.\n\nThe name of the dialect and the Surselva District is derived from \"sur\" 'above' and \"selva\" 'forest', with the forest in question being the \"Uaul Grond\" in the area affected by the Flims Rockslide. The word \"selva\" itself has fallen out of use in modern Sursilvan, with the most common word for forest being , an Old High German loanword. \"Selva\" is only used for in a few more recent terms such as \"selvicultura\" 'forestry', \"selvicultur\" 'forest officer', or \"cavrer selvadi\" 'Long-eared owl'.\n\nSursilvan is used across most of the Surselva District, with the exception of the Walser villages of Obersaxen, Vals, St. Martin and Safiental. Outside of the Surselva District, Flims is also part of the Sursilvan dialect area. In addition, Sursilvan was previously used as the written Romansh language of parts of the Sutsilvan dialect area. When a separate Sutsilvan written language was introduced in 1944, the villages of Bonaduz, Rhäzün s, Domat/Ems and Trin retained Sursilvan as their written language. In addition, Sursilvan was previously used in the Surmiran dialect area as the language of church, but has now been replaced by Standard Surmiran and Rumantsch Grischun.\n\nMost municipalities in which Sursilvan is the traditional language still have a Romansh-speaking majority today. The exceptions are \nFlims, Laax, Schnaus, Ilanz, Castrisch, Surcuolm, and Duvin. In all of these, except for Flims, however, a majority of people reported in the 2000 Swiss census to use Romansh daily, even if only a minority named it as their language of best command. In about half of the Sursilvan villages, Romansh is the language of best command of over 70% or 80%. The highest percentage is found in Vrin with over 95%. As a daily language, it is used in nearly all municipalities by at least 70%, in about half by more than 80%, and in a third by over 90%. Overall across the Sursilvan dialect area, in the census of 2000, 70.1% named Romansh as a habitually used language, while 58.3% named it as their language of best command.\n\nSursilvan spelling mostly follows a phonemic system.\n\nSursilvan nouns distinguish two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural).\n\nNouns in -a are overwhelmingly feminine (with few exceptions such as duca 'duke'). Nouns in consonants or other vowels can be either masculine or feminine.\n\nPlurals are formed with the suffix -s. Nouns already ending in -s do not add this plural ending, but nouns in -z and -sch follow the general rule. Nominalised past participles in -au have a plural in -ai. In addition, nouns may show vowel alternations or other irregularities:\n\nIn addition to the normal plural in -s many nouns also show a collective plural in -a. These forms typically occur with natural substances (rocks, wood, plants etc.) and human body parts. Syntactically these collective plurals behave like feminine singular nouns: \"La crappa ei dira.\" 'The rocks are hard. / The rock (= material) is hard.' (with f.sg. dira 'hard' agreeing with the subject la crappa 'the rock(s)') and may best be considered as an intermediate formation between inflection and derivation (Liver 1999:132).\n\nSursilvan has both a definite and an indefinite article. These are preposed and agree with their noun in gender and number. (The indefinite article only has singular forms.) Forms may differ depending on whether the following word starts with a vowel or a consonant:\n\nThe definite article contracts with a number of prepositions:\n\nThe adjective agrees with its noun in gender and number and (as in other Romance languages) usually follows it. \n\nA peculiarity of Sursilvan is that the adjective distinguishes an attributive and a predicative form in the masculine singular:\n\n\"in um vegl\" 'an old man'<br>\n\"igl um ei vegls\" 'the man is old'\n\nThe predicative masculine singular form is morphologically identical with the masculine plural. \n\nThe ending of the masculine plural is -s. Feminine adjectives suffix -a in the singular and -as in the plural. \nThe attributive masculine singular often differs from the other forms in its vocalism. \n\n\n\n\nSursilvan literature is published among others by the Lia Rumantscha in Chur.\n\n\nThe fable The Fox and the Crow by Jean de La Fontaine in Sursilvan, as well as a translation into English, the similar-looking but noticeably different-sounding dialect Sutsilvan, and Rumantsch Grischun.\n"}

{"id": "758568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=758568", "title": "Wymysorys language", "text": "Wymysorys language\n\nWymysorys (\"Wymysiöeryś\"), also known as Vilamovian or Wilamowicean, is a variety of High German, spoken in the small town of Wilamowice, Poland (\"Wymysoü\" in Wymysorys), on the border between Silesia and Lesser Poland, near Bielsko-Biała. It is considered an endangered language. There are probably between 70 and 100 native users of Wymysorys, virtually all bilingual; the majority are elderly.\n\nIn origin, Wymysorys appears to derive from 12th-century Middle High German, with a strong influence from Low German, Dutch, Polish, Old English and perhaps Frisian. The inhabitants of Wilamowice are thought to be descendants of German, Flemish and Scottish settlers who arrived in Poland during the 13th century. However, the inhabitants of Wilamowice always denied any connections with Germany and proclaimed their Flemish origins. Although related to German, Wymysorys is not mutually intelligible with Standard German (that is the case for most other German dialects as well).\n\nWymysorys was the vernacular language of Wilamowice until 1939–1945. However, it seems it has been in decline since the late 19th century. In 1880 as many as 92% of the town's inhabitants spoke Wymysorys (1525 out of 1662), in 1890 - only 72%, in 1900 - 67%, in 1910 - 73% again. Although Wymysorys was taught in local schools (under the name of \"local variety of German\"), since 1875 the basic language of instruction in most schools in Austro-Hungarian Galicia was Polish. During World War II and the German occupation of Poland Wymysorys was openly promoted by the Nazi administration, but after the war the tables turned: local communist authorities forbade the use of Wymysorys in any form. The widespread bilingualism of the people saved most local residents from being forcibly resettled to Germany, many of them stopped teaching their children their language or even using it in daily life. Although the ban was lifted after 1956, Wymysorys has been gradually replaced by Polish, especially amongst the younger generation. \n\nActing on a proposal by Tymoteusz Król, the Library of Congress added the Wymysorys language to the register of languages on July 18, 2007. It was also registered in the International Organization for Standardization, where it received the \"wym\" ISO 639-3 code. In a 2009 UNESCO report Wymysorys has been reported as \"severely endangered\" and nearly extinct. \n\nWymysorys was the language of the poetry of Florian Biesik, during the 19th century.\n\nSome new revitalization efforts have been started within the first decade of the 21st century, led by speaker Tymoteusz Król, whose efforts include private lessons with a group of pupils as well as compiling language records, standardizing written orthography and compiling the first ever dictionary of Wymysorys. Additionally, a new project called The Wymysiöeryśy Akademyj – Accademia Wilamowicziana or WA-AW was established under the \"Artes Liberales\" program at the University of Warsaw with the intention of creating a unified scholastic body for the study of the Wymysorys language.\n\nWymysorys has been for centuries mostly a spoken language. It was not until the times of Florian Biesik, the first author of major literary works in the language, that a need for a separate version of a Latin alphabet arose. Biesik wrote most of his works in plain Polish alphabet, which he considered better-suited for the phonetics of his language. In recent times Józef Gara (1929–2013), another author of works in the local language, devised a distinct Wymysorys alphabet, consisting of 34 letters derived from the Latin script and mostly based on Polish as well:\nWilamowicean orthography includes the digraph \"AO\", which is treated as a separate letter.\n\nA sample of Wymysorys words with German, Dutch and English translations.
