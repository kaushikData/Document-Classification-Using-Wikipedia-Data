They form one of the two major branches of the Wazir tribe, with the other being the Utmanzai of North Waziristan Agency, Pakistan. The common ancestor of the Ahmadzai and Utmanzai is Wazir, who is also ancestor to the Mehsuds who have since taken a distinct and divergent path. Through Wazir, the tribes trace their origins to Karlanri and thence to the founder of the Pashtun lineage, Qais Abdur Rashid. Ahmad was a son of Wazir.\n\nThe tribe are Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi sect, although not particularly strict in observance of their religious beliefs. It is possible that some have come under the influence of the Deobandi sect, followers of which have in recent years become active in areas where the tribe lives.\n\nThe Ahmadzai wazirs were originally settled on the border between Birmal Valley area of modern-day Afghanistan and North Waziristan, Pakistan. Today, they inhabit Pakistan and are primarily a pastoral community that earn a living from the rearing of sheep. Many Ahmadzai migrate between areas according to the seasons. The majority are found in Bannu District and around one-third live in the South Waziristan Agency, a Federally Administered Tribal Area of Pakistan.

{"id": "95135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95135", "title": "Amharic", "text": "Amharic\n\nAmharic ( or ; Amharic: , \"\", ) is one of the Ethiopian Semitic languages, which are a subgrouping within the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic languages. It is spoken as a first language by the Amharas and as a lingua franca by other populations residing in major cities and towns of Ethiopia. The language serves as the official working language of Ethiopia, and is also the official or working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system. With 21,811,600 total speakers as of 2007, including around 4,000,000 L2 speakers, Amharic is the second-most commonly spoken Semitic language in the world, after Arabic.\n\nAmharic is written left-to-right using a system that grew out of the Ge'ez script, called, in Ethiopian Semitic languages, \"Fidäl\" (), \"writing system\", \"letter\", or \"character\" or \"abugida\" (), from the first four symbols, which gave rise to the modern linguistic term abugida.\n\nThere is no agreed way of romanising Amharic into Latin script. The Amharic examples in the sections below use one system that is common, though not universal, among linguists specialising in Ethiopian Semitic languages.\n\nIt has been the working language of courts, language of trade and everyday communications, the military, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church since the late 12th century and remains the official language of Ethiopia today. As of the 2007 census, Amharic is spoken by 21.6 million native speakers in Ethiopia and 4 million secondary speakers in Ethiopia. Additionally, 3 million emigrants outside of Ethiopia speak the language. Most of the Ethiopian Jewish communities in Ethiopia and Israel speak Amharic. In Washington DC, Amharic became one of the six non-English languages in the Language Access Act of 2004, which allows government services and education in Amharic. Furthermore, Amharic is considered a holy language by the Rastafari religion and is widely used among its followers worldwide. It is the most widely spoken language in the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe Amharic ejective consonants correspond to the Proto-Semitic \"emphatic consonants\", usually transcribed with a dot below the letter. The consonant and vowel tables give these symbols in parentheses where they differ from the standard IPA symbols.\n\nThe Amharic script is an abugida, and the graphemes of the Amharic writing system are called \"fidel\". Each character represents a consonant+vowel sequence, but the basic shape of each character is determined by the consonant, which is modified for the vowel. Some consonant phonemes are written by more than one series of characters: , , , and (the last one has \"four\" distinct letter forms). This is because these \"fidel\" originally represented distinct sounds, but phonological changes merged them. The citation form for each series is the consonant+\"ä\" form, i.e. the first column of the \"fidel\". The Amharic script is included in Unicode, and glyphs are included in fonts available with major operating systems.\n\nAs in most other Ethiopian Semitic languages, gemination is contrastive in Amharic. That is, consonant length can distinguish words from one another; for example, \"alä\" 'he said', \"allä\" 'there is'; \"yǝmätall\" 'he hits', \"yǝmmättall\" 'he is hit'. Gemination is not indicated in Amharic orthography, but Amharic readers typically do not find this to be a problem. This property of the writing system is analogous to the vowels of Arabic and Hebrew or the tones of many Bantu languages, which are not normally indicated in writing. Ethiopian novelist Haddis Alemayehu, who was an advocate of Amharic orthography reform, indicated gemination in his novel \"Fǝqǝr Ǝskä Mäqabǝr\" by placing a dot above the characters whose consonants were geminated, but this practice is rare.\n\nPunctuation includes the following:\n\n\nOne may construct simple Amharic sentences by using a subject and a predicate. Here are a few simple sentences:\n\nIn most languages, there is a small number of basic distinctions of person, number, and often gender that play a role within the grammar of the language. The distinctions within the basic set of independent personal pronouns can be seen in English \"I\", Amharic '; English \"she\", Amharic '. In Amharic, as in other Semitic languages, the same distinctions appear in three other places in their grammar.\n\nAll Amharic verbs agree with their subjects; that is, the person, number, and (in the second- and third-person singular) gender of the subject of the verb are marked by suffixes or prefixes on the verb. Because the affixes that signal subject agreement vary greatly with the particular verb tense/aspect/mood, they are normally not considered to be pronouns and are discussed elsewhere in this article under verb conjugation.\nAmharic verbs often have additional morphology that indicates the person, number, and (second- and third-person singular) gender of the object of the verb.\n\nWhile morphemes such as \"-at\" in this example are sometimes described as signaling object agreement, analogous to subject agreement, they are more often thought of as object pronoun suffixes because, unlike the markers of subject agreement, they do not vary significantly with the tense/aspect/mood of the verb. For arguments of the verb other than the subject or the object, there are two separate sets of related suffixes, one with a benefactive meaning (\"to\", \"for\"), the other with an adversative or locative meaning (\"against\", \"to the detriment of\", \"on\", \"at\").\n\nMorphemes such as \"-llat\" and \"-bbat\" in these examples will be referred to in this article as prepositional object pronoun suffixes because they correspond to prepositional phrases such as \"for her\" and \"on her\", to distinguish them from the direct object pronoun suffixes such as \"-at\" 'her'.\nAmharic has a further set of morphemes that are suffixed to nouns, signalling possession: \"bet\" 'house', \"bete\", \"my house\", ; \"betwa\", \"her house\".\n\nIn each of these four aspects of the grammar, independent pronouns, subject–verb agreement, object pronoun suffixes, and possessive suffixes, Amharic distinguishes eight combinations of person, number, and gender. For first person, there is a two-way distinction between singular (\"I\") and plural (\"we\"), whereas for second and third persons, there is a distinction between singular and plural and within the singular a further distinction between masculine and feminine (\"you m. sg.\", \"you f. sg.\", \"you pl.\", \"he\", \"she\", \"they\").\n\nAmharic is a pro-drop language: neutral sentences in which no element is emphasized normally omit independent pronouns: ' 'he's Ethiopian', ' 'I invited her'. The Amharic words that translate \"he\", \"I\", and \"her\" do not appear in these sentences as independent words. However, in such cases, the person, number, and (second- or third-person singular) gender of the subject and object are marked on the verb. When the subject or object in such sentences is emphasized, an independent pronoun is used: ' 'he's Ethiopian', ' 'I invited her', \" 'I invited her'.\n\nThe table below shows alternatives for many of the forms.\nThe choice depends on what precedes the form in question, usually whether this is a vowel or a consonant, for example, for the first-person singular possessive suffix, ' 'my country', ' 'my body'.\n\nWithin second- and third-person singular, there are two additional polite independent pronouns, for reference to people to whom the speaker wishes to show respect. This usage is an example of the so-called T–V distinction that is made in many languages. The polite pronouns in Amharic are \"ǝrswo\" 'you (sg. polite)'. and \"ǝssaččäw\" 's/he (polite)'. Although these forms are singular semantically—they refer to one person—they correspond to third-person plural elsewhere in the grammar, as is common in other T–V systems. For the possessive pronouns, however, the polite 2nd person has the special suffix \"-wo\" 'your sg. pol.'\n\nFor possessive pronouns (\"mine\", \"yours\", etc.), Amharic adds the independent pronouns to the preposition ' 'of': ' 'mine', ' 'yours m. sg.', 'yours f. sg.', ' 'hers', etc.\n\nFor reflexive pronouns ('myself', 'yourself', etc.), Amharic adds the possessive suffixes to the noun \"ras\" 'head': \"rase\" 'myself', \"raswa\" 'herself', etc.\n\nLike English, Amharic makes a two-way distinction between near ('this, these') and far ('that, those') demonstrative expressions (pronouns, adjectives, adverbs). Besides number, as in English, Amharic also distinguishes masculine and feminine gender in the singular.\n\nThere are also separate demonstratives for formal reference, comparable to the formal personal pronouns: \"ǝññih\" 'this, these (formal)' and \"ǝnniya\" 'that, those (formal)'.\n\nThe singular pronouns have combining forms beginning with \"zz\" instead of \"y\" when they follow a preposition: \"sǝläzzih\" 'because of this; therefore', \"ǝndäzziya\" 'like that'. Note that the plural demonstratives, like the second and third person plural personal pronouns, are formed by adding the plural prefix \"ǝnnä-\" to the singular masculine forms.\n\nAmharic nouns can be primary or derived. A noun like ' 'foot, leg' is primary, and a noun like ' 'pedestrian' is a derived noun.\n\nAmharic nouns can have a masculine or feminine gender. There are several ways to express gender. An example is the old suffix \"-t\" for femininity. This suffix is no longer productive and is limited to certain patterns and some isolated nouns. Nouns and adjectives ending in \"-awi\" usually take the suffix \"-t\" to form the feminine form, e.g. \"ityop̣p̣ya-(a)wi\" 'Ethiopian (m.)' vs. \"ityop̣p̣ya-wi-t\" 'Ethiopian (f.)'; \"sämay-awi\" 'heavenly (m.)' vs. \"sämay-awi-t\" 'heavenly (f.)'. This suffix also occurs in nouns and adjective based on the pattern ', e.g. ' 'king' vs. ' 'queen' and ' 'holy (m.)' vs. \"\" 'holy (f.)'.\n\nSome nouns and adjectives take a feminine marker \"-it\": ' 'child, boy' vs. ' 'girl'; \"bäg\" 'sheep, ram' vs. \"bäg-it\" 'ewe'; ' 'senior, elder (m.)' vs. ' 'old woman'; \"t'ot'a\" 'monkey' vs. \"t'ot'-it\" 'monkey (f.)'. Some nouns have this feminine marker without having a masculine opposite, e.g. \"\" 'spider', \"azur-it\" 'whirlpool, eddy'. There are, however, also nouns having this \"-it\" suffix that are treated as masculine: \"säraw-it\" 'army', \"nägar-it\" 'big drum'.\n\nThe feminine gender is not only used to indicate biological gender, but may also be used to express smallness, e.g. \"bet-it-u\" 'the little house' (lit. house--). The feminine marker can also serve to express tenderness or sympathy.\n\nAmharic has special words that can be used to indicate the gender of people and animals. For people, \"wänd\" is used for masculinity and \"set\" for femininity, e.g. \"wänd lǝǧ\" 'boy', \"set lǝǧ\" 'girl'; \"wänd hakim\" 'physician, doctor (m.)', \"set hakim\" 'physician, doctor (f.)'.\n\nFor animals, the words \"täbat\", \"awra\", or \"wänd\" (less usual) can be used to indicate masculine gender, and \"\" or \"set\" to indicate feminine gender. Examples: \"täbat t'ǝǧa\" 'calf (m.)'; \"awra doro\" 'cock (rooster)'; \"set doro\" 'hen'.\n\nThe plural suffix ' is used to express plurality of nouns. Some morphophonological alternations occur depending on the final consonant or vowel. For nouns ending in a consonant, plain ' is used: \"bet\" 'house' becomes ' 'houses'. For nouns ending in a back vowel (-a, -o, -u), the suffix takes the form ', e.g. ' 'dog', ' 'dogs'; \"käbäro\" 'drum', ' 'drums'. Nouns that end in a front vowel pluralize using ' or ', e.g. ' 'scholar', ' or ' 'scholars'. Another possibility for nouns ending in a vowel is to delete the vowel and use plain ', as in ' 'dogs'.\n\nBesides using the normal external plural (\"-očč\"), nouns and adjectives can be pluralized by way of reduplicating one of the \"radicals\". For example, \"wäyzäro\" 'lady' can take the normal plural, yielding ', but ' 'ladies' is also found (Leslau 1995:173).\n\nSome kinship-terms have two plural forms with a slightly different meaning. For example, ' 'brother' can be pluralized as ' 'brothers' but also as ' 'brothers of each other'. Likewise, ' 'sister' can be pluralized as ' ('sisters'), but also as ' 'sisters of each other'.\n\nIn compound words, the plural marker is suffixed to the second noun: ' 'church' (lit. house of Christian) becomes ' 'churches'.\n\nAmsalu Aklilu has pointed out that Amharic has inherited a large number of old plural forms directly from Classical Ethiopic (Ge'ez) (Leslau 1995:172). There are basically two archaic pluralising strategies, called external and internal plural. The external plural consists of adding the suffix \"-an\" (usually masculine) or \"-at\" (usually feminine) to the singular form. The internal plural employs vowel quality or apophony to pluralize words, similar to English \"man\" vs. \"men\" and \"goose\" vs. \"geese\". Sometimes combinations of the two systems are found. The archaic plural forms are sometimes used to form new plurals, but this is only considered grammatical in more established cases.\n\n\nIf a noun is definite or \"specified\", this is expressed by a suffix, the \"article\", which is -\"u\" or -\"w\" for masculine singular nouns and -\"wa\", -\"itwa\" or -\"ätwa\" for feminine singular nouns. For example:\nIn singular forms, this article distinguishes between the male and female gender; in plural forms this distinction is absent, and all definites are marked with -\"u\", e.g. bet-očč-u 'houses', gäräd-očč-u 'maids'. As in the plural, morphophonological alternations occur depending on the final consonant or vowel.\nAmharic has an accusative marker, -\"(ə)n\". Its use is related to the definiteness of the object, thus Amharic shows differential object marking. In general, if the object is definite, possessed, or a proper noun, the accusative must be used (Leslau 1995: pp. 181 ff.).\n\nThe accusative suffix is usually placed after the first word of the noun phrase:\n\nAmharic has various ways to derive nouns from other words or other nouns. One way of nominalising consists of a form of \"vowel agreement\" (similar vowels on similar places) inside the three-radical structures typical of Semitic languages. For example:\nThere are also several nominalising suffixes.\n\nAs in other Semitic languages, Amharic verbs use a combination of prefixes and suffixes to indicate the subject, distinguishing 3 persons, two numbers, and (in all persons except first-person and \"honorific\" pronouns) two genders.\n\nAlong with the infinitive and the present participle, the gerund is one of three non-finite verb forms. The infinitive is a nominalized verb, the present participle expresses incomplete action, and the gerund expresses completed action, e.g. \"\" bälto \"wädä gäbäya hedä\" 'Ali, having eaten lunch, went to the market'.\nThere are several usages of the gerund depending on its morpho-syntactic features.\n\nThe gerund functions as the head of a subordinate clause (see the example above). There may be more than one gerund in one sentence.\nThe gerund is used to form the following tense forms:\n\nThe gerund can be used as an adverb:\nalfo alfo \" 'Sometimes he laughs'. (From ማለፍ 'to pass'; lit. \"passing passing\")\n' dägmo ' 'I also want to come'. (From መድገም 'to repeat'; lit. \"I, repeating, want to come\")\n\nAdjectives are words or constructions used to qualify nouns. Adjectives in Amharic can be formed in several ways: they can be based on nominal patterns, or derived from nouns, verbs and other parts of speech. Adjectives can be nominalized by way of suffixing the nominal article (see Nouns above). Amharic has few primary adjectives. Some examples are ' 'kind, generous', ' 'mute, dumb, silent', \" 'yellow'.\n\nThe adjective and the noun together are called the 'adjective noun complex'. In Amharic, the adjective precedes the noun, with the verb last; e.g. ' 'a bad master'; ' (lit. big house he-built) 'he built a big house'.\n\nIf the adjective noun complex is definite, the definite article is suffixed to the adjective and not to the noun, e.g. ' (lit. big- house) 'the big house'. In a possessive construction, the adjective takes the definite article, and the noun takes the pronominal possessive suffix, e.g. ' (lit. big- house-my) \"my big house\".\n\nWhen enumerating adjectives using ' 'and', both adjectives take the definite article: ' (lit. pretty--and intelligent- girl came) \"the pretty and intelligent girl came\". In the case of an indefinite plural adjective noun complex, the noun is plural and the adjective may be used in singular or in plural form. Thus, 'diligent students' can be rendered ' (lit. diligent student-) or ' (lit. diligent- student-).\n\nNot much has been published about Amharic dialect differences. All dialects are mutually intelligible, but certain minor variations are noted.\n\nMittwoch described a form of Amharic spoken by the descendants of Weyto language speakers,\nbut it was likely not a dialect of Amharic so much as the result of incomplete language learning as the community shifted languages from Weyto to Amharic.\n\nThere is a growing body of literature in Amharic in many genres. This literature includes government proclamations and records, educational books, religious material, novels, poetry, proverb collections, dictionaries (monolingual and bilingual), technical manuals, medical topics, etc. The Holy Bible was first translated into Amharic by Abu Rumi in the early 19th century, but other translations of the Bible into Amharic have been done since. The most famous Amharic novel is \"Fiqir Iske Meqabir\" (transliterated various ways) by Haddis Alemayehu (1909–2003), translated into English by Sisay Ayenew with the title \"Love unto Crypt\", published in 2005 ().\n\nThe word \"Rastafari\" comes from \"Ras Täfäri\", the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie, composed of the Amharic words \"Ras\" (literally \"Head\", an Ethiopian title equivalent to duke) and Haile Selassie's pre-regnal name, Tafari.\n\nMany Rastafarians learn Amharic as a second language, as they consider it to be sacred. After Haile Selassie's 1966 visit to Jamaica, study circles in Amharic were organized in Jamaica as part of the ongoing exploration of Pan-African identity and culture. Various reggae artists in the 1970s, including Ras Michael, Lincoln Thompson and Misty in Roots, have sung in Amharic, thus bringing the language to a wider audience. The Abyssinians, a reggae group, have also used Amharic, most notably in the song \"Satta Massagana\". The title was believed to mean \"give thanks\"; however, this phrase means \"he thanked\" or \"he praised\", as ' means \"he gave\", and ' \"thanks\" or \"praise\". The correct way to say \"give thanks\" in Amharic is one word, \"misgana\". The word \"satta\" has become a common expression in the Rastafari dialect of English, Iyaric, meaning \"to sit down and partake\".\n\nAmharic is supported on most major Linux distributions, including Fedora and Ubuntu.\n\nThe Amharic script is included in Unicode, in the Ethiopic block (U+1200 – U+137F). Nyala font is included on Windows 7 (see YouTube video) and Vista (Amharic Language Interface Pack) to display and edit using the Amharic Script. In February 2010, Microsoft released its Windows Vista operating system in Amharic, enabling Amharic speakers to use its operating system in their language.\n\nGoogle has added Amharic to its Language Tools which allows typing Amharic Script online without an Amharic Keyboard. Since 2004 Wikipedia has Amharic language Wiki that uses Ethiopic (Ge'ez) script. In 2015 an Ethiopic rendering method for computers using a keystroke for the default and a maximum of two keystrokes for the rest of the glyphs was granted a patent by the U.S. government. In 2017 an Ethiopic rendering method for smartphones and iPad using a keystroke for the default and a maximum of two keystrokes for the rest of the glyphs was granted a patent by the U.S. government.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12952628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12952628", "title": "Atacama people", "text": "Atacama people\n\nThe Atacama people, known as atacameños or atacamas in Spanish and kunzas, Likan-antai or Likanantaí in English, are an indigenous people from the Atacama Desert and altiplano region in the north of Chile and Argentina and southern Bolivia.\n\nAccording to the Argentinean Census in 2010, 13,936 people identified as first-generation Atacameño in Argentina, while Chile was home to 21,015 Atacameño people as of 2002.\n\nThe origins of Atacameño culture can be traced back to 500 AD. The Tiwanaku people were the first known conquerers. At the start of the 15th century, the Atacameño were conquered by the Inca Topa Inca Yupanqui, who introduced a new social order, the Inca sun cult and various customs including coca leaves. The Inca regime constructed roads from the Salar de Atacama to what is now north east Argentina.\n\nIn 1535, the first Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area and it was finally annexed under Spanish control in 1556. In the 18th century, the Atacameño Tomás Paniri joined the uprisings led by the Peruvian Túpac Amaru II and the Bolivian Túpac Katari. In 1824, the region became part of Bolivia and in 1883 fell into Chilean hands. In 2007, the Atacameño population was estimated at 21,015 people.\n\nThe Atacameños protected their villages with strong stone walls known as \"pukara\", a Quechua word. They also developed ceramic crafts, copper work (using copper extracted from Chuquicamata) and gold work. Many of the historic villages still exist today with the same names, including Quitor, Chiu-Chiu, Lasana, Turi, Topayín, Susques, Calama, Toconao, Antofagasta de la Sierra, and one of the most important settlements in the region, San Pedro de Atacama.\n\nThe original language of the Atacameños was the recently extinct language of kunza.\n\nThe Atacameño were lamini herders who made best use of the scarce water and sparse terrain by using their livestock - llama and alpaca - both as pack animals and for their meat, hide and wool.\n\nLike many other Andean peoples, the Atacameño created a terraced agriculture to prevent water run-off. They grew various crops, including pumpkins, zucchini, chili, beans, tobacco, melon, corn, and, above all, potatoes and quinoa. They fertilised the crops with guano from seabirds, which they transported inland on llama. They also ate meat from their livestock and bought fish and shellfish from coastal peoples in return for \"ch'arki\", a dried, salted meat they produced.\n\nThe first period, between the years of 400 AD and 900 AD, saw the Atacameño produce pink glazed pottery, including anthropomorphic jugs, as well as golden jewelry and cups.\n\nDuring the second period, between 900 AD and 1200 AD, black glaze pottery was used, showing the influence of Tiwanaku culture. Artifacts included tablets for inhaling hallucinogens from the Huilco tree and San Pedro cactus, with carved images of human figurines, condors and religious objects.\n\nIn the third period, from 1200 AD to 1500 AD, shows the influence of the Inca civilization with the construction of stone “pukara” fortresses.\n\nSmoking hallucinogenic substances was a central part of Atacameño religious culture.smoking ceremonies were believed to bring humans closer to the gods, allowing the smoker to take on the power of birds, cats or snakes. Finely carved tablets were used to hold the drug, which was then inhaled using wooden or bone tubes. The Atacameños also adopted the Inca sun cult and constructed altars in high places, especially on Licancabur volcano, which was considered sacred and the home of their many gods. They believed in life after death and buried their dead with all the necessary belongings they would need for the journey.\n\nSan Pedro de Atacama was the Atacameños primary oasis settlement and the centre of their cultural development. Today, tourism is its main economic activity along with agriculture.\n\nThe R.P. Gustavo Le Paige Archeological Museum, located in San Pedro de Atacama, holds much of the historical and archeological remains of the Atacameño people. It was founded by the Belgian Jesuit priest Gustavo Le Paige, who moved to San Pedro in 1955 and became fascinated with Atacameño culture. Over the years he collected a wide range of artifacts from ancient burial sites, workshops and settlements, housing them in the museum which bears his name, which he founded in 1963. The collection now contains mummies and more than 380,000 pieces of ceramics, textiles and metallic artifacts.\n\nAtacameño communities currently living in Argentina include:\n\n\n\n\n\nAtacameño communities currently living in Chile include:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30861351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30861351", "title": "Australian Aboriginal kinship", "text": "Australian Aboriginal kinship\n\nAustralian Aboriginal kinship are the systems of law governing social interaction, particularly marriage, in traditional Australian Aboriginal cultures. It is an integral part of the culture of every Aboriginal group across Australia.\n\nSubsection systems are a unique social structure that divide all of Australian Aboriginal society into a number of groups, each of which combines particular sets of kin. In Central Australian Aboriginal English vernacular, subsections are widely known as \"skins\". Each subsection is given a name that can be used to refer to individual members of that group. Skin is passed down by a person's parents to their children.\n\nThe name of the groups can vary. There are systems with two such groupings (these are known as 'moieties' in kinship studies), systems with four (sections), six and eight (subsection systems). Some language groups extend this by having distinct male and female forms, giving a total of sixteen skin names, for example the Pintupi (listed below) and Warlpiri. While membership in skin groups is ideally based on blood relations, Australian Aboriginal subsection systems are classificatory, meaning that even people who are not actual blood relations are assigned to a subsection. They are also universal, meaning that every member of the society is assigned a position in the system.\n\nSubsection systems are found in Aboriginal societies across much of Central, Western and Northern Australia. On the basis of detailed analysis and comparison of the various subsection systems and their terminologies, and in particular the apparent prefix /j-/ for male and /n-/ for female, it has been identified as a social innovation originally from the Daly River region of the Northern Territory, which then spread rapidly southwards to other groups.\n\nThe Yolŋu people of north-eastern Arnhem Land divide society (and much of the natural world) into two moieties: \"Dhuwa\" and \"Yirritja\". Each of these is represented by people of a number of different groups (each with their own lands, languages and philosophies) through their hereditary estates – so many things are either \"Yirritja\" or \"Dhuwa\":\n\nFish, stone, river, sea etc., belongs to one or the other moiety. Things that are not either Dhuwa or Yirritja are called \"wakinŋu\". Yolŋu also have a kinship system with eight subsections (four Dhuwa and four Yirritja which is what creates moiety).\n\nThe Gamilaraay language group from New South Wales have a four section system.\n\nThe Martuthunira language group from the Pilbara region of Western Australia have a four section system. (The spelling l.y indicates that the letters represent two distinct phonemes, and are not a digraph).\n\nSimilar systems are found across most language groups in the Pilbara, though with some variation in the forms of the names. For example, speakers of Ngarla use \"Milangka\" where Martuthunira use \"Pal.yarri\".\n\nThe Alyawarre language group from Central Australia also have a four section system, but use different terms from the Martuthunira.\n\nThe Lardil of Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria have eight subsection groups, shown here with some of their totems:\n\nEach Lardil person belongs to one of these groups. Their paternal grandfather's subsection determines their own; so a Balyarriny man or woman will have a Balyarriny grandfather. Members of each group may only marry members of one other, specified, group.\n\nOnce a person's subsection group is known, their relationship to any other Lardil can be determined. A Ngarrijbalangi is a 'father' to a Bangariny, a 'father-in-law' to a Yakimarr and a 'son' to another Bangariny, either in a social sense or purely through linearship.\n\nThe mechanics of the Lardil skin system means that generations of males cycle back and forth between two subsections. \"Ngarrijbalangi\" is father to \"Bangariny\" and \"Bangariny\" is father to \"Ngarrijbalangi\" and similarly for the three other pairs of subsections. Generations of women, however, cycle through four subsections before arriving back at the starting point. This means that a woman has the same subsection name as her (matrilineal) great-great-grandmother.\n\nThe Pintupi of the Western Desert also have an eight subsection system, made more complex by distinct forms for male and female subsection names; male forms begin with \"Tj\", the female forms with \"N\". The Warlpiri system is almost the same:\n\nThe Kunwinjku of Western Arnhem Land have a similar system; male forms begin with \"Na\", the female forms with \"Ngal\":\n\nEach person therefore has a patrimoiety and a matrimoiety, a father's and a mother's subsection group.\n\nOutsiders who have significant interaction with such groups may be given a 'skin name', commonly based on the people they have interacted with and the types of interaction.\n\nThe variety of English used by many Australian Aboriginal people employs kinship terms in ways that are based on their equivalents in Australian Aboriginal languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3430097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3430097", "title": "Bicolano people", "text": "Bicolano people\n\nThe Bicolanos are the fifth-largest Filipino ethnolinguistic group. Their indigenous region is commonly considered to be Bicolandia, a region composing part of the Bicol Peninsula and neighbouring islands of south-east Luzon.\n\nThe Bicolano people are largely an agricultural and rural people, producing rice, coconuts, and hemp. Nearly all of them are Roman Catholics. Their language is closely related to others of the central Philippines, all of which belong to the Austronesian\n(Malayo-Polynesian) family of languages.\n\nAccording to a folk epic entitled Ibalong, the people of the region were formerly called Ibalong or Ibalnong, a name believed to have been derived from Gat Ibal who ruled Sawangan (now Legazpi City) in ancient times. Ibalong used to mean the \"people of Ibal\"; eventually, this was shortened to Ibalon. The word Bikol, which replaced Ibalon, was originally \"bikod\" (meaning \"meandering\"), a word which supposedly described the principal river of that area.\n\nArchaeological diggings, dating back to as early as the Neolithic, and accidental findings resulting from the mining industry, road-building and railway projects in the region, reveal that the Bicol mainland is a rich storehouse of ceramic artefacts. Burial cave findings also point to the pre-Hispanic practice of using burial jars.\n\nThe Spanish influence in Bicol resulted mainly from the efforts of Augustinian and Franciscan Spanish missionaries. Through the Franciscans, the annual feast of the Virgin of Peñafrancia, the Patroness for Bicolandia, was started. Father Miguel Robles asked a local artist to carve a replica of the statue of the Virgin in Salamanca; now, the statue is celebrated through an annual fluvial parade in Naga City.\nBicolanos actively participated in the national resistance to the American and Japanese occupations through two well known leaders who rose up in arms: Simeón Ola and Governor Wenceslao Q. Vinzons.\n\nBicolanos live in the southeastern peninsula of Luzon, now containing the provinces of Albay, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Catanduanes, Sorsogon and Masbate (although the majority of Masbate's population are Visayans). Many Bicolanos also live in the province of Quezon.\n\nBicolanos number about 5,900,700. They are descended from Austronesian-speaking immigrants who came from Taiwan during the Iron Age. Many Bicolanos also have Chinese, and Spanish admixtures. Most of the townsfolk have small traces of each heritage while their language is referred to as Bicol or Bicolano. The Bicolano language is very fragmented, and its dialects are mutually incomprehensible to speakers of other Bicolano dialects. The majority of the Bicolano people are devout Roman Catholics and Catholic Mass is celebrated daily in many churches in the Bicol Region.\n\nThe Bicolano cuisine is primarily noted for the prominent use of chili peppers and \"gata\" (coconut milk) in its food. A classic example is the \"gulay na lada\", known outside the region as Bicol Express, a well-loved dish using \"siling labuyo\" (native small chillies) and the aforementioned \"gata\". Meals are generally rich in carbohydrates and viands of vegetables, fish, and meat are cooked in various ways. Bicolanos almost always cook their vegetables in coconut milk; for meat recipes such as pochero, adobo, and tapa. A special meat dish is the dinuguan. Fishes that serve as common viand are mackerel and anchovy; in Lake Buhi, the sinarapan or \"tabyos\" (known as the smallest fish in the world) is common.\n\nCopra processing and abacá stripping are generally done by hand. Fishing is also an important industry and fish supply is normally plentiful during the months of May through September. Organized or big-time fishing makes use of costly nets and motor-powered and electric-lighted boats or launches called \"palakaya\" or \"basnigan\". Individual fishermen, on the other hand, commonly use two types of nets – the \"basnig\" and the \"pangki\" as well as the \"chinchoro\", \"buliche\", and \"sarap\". In Lake Buhi, the \"sarap\" and \"sumbiling\" are used; the small fishes caught through the former is the sinarapan. The \"bunuan\" (corral) of the \"inangcla\", \"sakag\", \"sibi-sibid\" and \"sakag\" types are common. The \"banwit\", two kinds of which are the \"og-og\" and \"kitang\", are also used. Mining and the manufacture of various items from abaca are important industries. The former started when the Spaniards discovered the Paracale mines in Camarines Norte.\n\nCoconut and abacá are two dollar-earning products that are grown in the coastal valleys hillsides or slopes of several fertile volcanoes respectively. The Bicol River basin or rice granary provide the peasants rice, corn, and root crops for food and small cash surplus when crops evade the dreaded frequent typhoons. For land preparation, carabao-drawn plough and harrow are generally used; sickles are used for cutting rice stalks, threshing is done either by stepping on or beating the rice straws with \"basbas\" and cleaning is done with the use of the \"nigo\" (winnowing basket).\n\nLike their other neighbouring regions, Bicolanas are also expected to lend a hand in household work. They are even anticipated to offer assistance after being married. On the other hand, Bicolano men are expected to assume the role of becoming the primary source of income and financial support of his family. Close family ties and religiosity are important traits for survival in the typhoon-prone physical environment. Some persisting traditional practices are the \"pamalay\", \"pantomina\" and \"tigsikan\". Beliefs on god, the soul and life after death are strongly held by the people. Related to these, there are annual rituals like the \"pabasa\", \"tanggal\", \"fiestas\" and \"flores de mayo\". Side by side with these are held beliefs on spiritual beings as the \"tawo sa lipod\", \"duwende\", \"onglo\", \"tambaluslos\", \"kalag\", \"katambay\", \"aswang\" and \"mangkukulam\".\n\nOn the whole, the value system of the Bicolanos shows the influence of Spanish religious doctrines and American materialism merged with traditional animistic beliefs. Consequently it is a multi-cultural system which evolved through the years to accommodate the realities of the erratic regional climatic conditions in a varied geographical setting. Such traits can be gleaned from numerous folk tales and folk songs that abound, the most known of which is the . The heroic stories reflect such traits as kindness, a determination to conquer evil forces, resourcefulness and courage. The folk song come in the form of \"awit\", \"sinamlampati\", \"panayokyok\", \"panambitan\", \"hatol\", \"pag-omaw\", \"rawit-dawit\" and children’s song and chants.\n\nTo suit the tropical climate, Bicolanos use light material for their houses; others now have bungalows to withstand the impact of strong typhoons. Light, western styled clothes are predominantly used now. The typical Bicolano wears light, western styled clothes similar to the Filipinos in urban centres. Seldom, if ever, are there Bicolanos weaving \"sinamy\" or piña for clothing as in the past; \"sinamy\" is reserved now for pillow cases, mosquito nets, fishing nets, bags and other decorative items.\nBicolanos observe an annual festival in honour of the Virgin of Peñafrancia every third Sunday of September. The towns of Naga comes alive. During the celebration, a jostling crowd of all-male devotees carries the image of the Virgin on their shoulders to the cathedral, while shouting \"Viva La Virgin!\" For the next seven days people, mostly Bicolanos, come for an annual visit light candles and kisses the image of the Virgin. To the Bicolanos, this affair is religious and cultural, as well. Every night, shows are held at the plaza the year's biggest cockfights take place, bicycle races are held and the river, a lively boat race precedes the fluvial procession. At noon of the third Saturday of the month, the devotees carry the Image on their shoulders preceded to the packed waterfront. The image is boarded onto the barge and the procession begins. With much splashing back to the old chapel until next year's celebration.\n\nPrior to Spanish colonization, the Bikolano people believed in an indigenous pantheon of deities. These deities were honoured in feasts and everyday life ways. Among the most notable of these deities of Ibalon (present Bicol Region) are:\n\n\n"}

Bobo is also a shortened name of the second-largest city in Burkina Faso, Bobo-Dioulasso.\n\nIn much of the literature on African art, the group that lives in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso is called Bobo-Fing, literally \"black Bobo\". These people call themselves Bobo and speak the Bobo language, a Mande language. The Bambara people also call another ethnic group \"Bobo\", the Bobo-Oule/Wule, more precisely called the Bwa. While the Bwa (Bobo-Oule) are a Gur people, speaking Gur languages (the Bwa languages), the true Bobo (Bobo Madare, Bobo Fing) are a Mande people.\n\nThe Bobo number about 110,000 people, with the great majority in Burkina Faso. The major Bobo community in the south is Bobo-Dioulasso, the second-largest city of Burkina Faso and the old French colonial capital. Further north are large towns, including and Kouka, with Boura in the extreme north in Mali.\n\nThe Bobo are far from homogeneous. They are an ancient aggregation of several peoples who have assembled around a number of core clans that do not preserve any oral traditions of immigration into the area. Their language and culture are more closely related to those of their Mandé neighbours to the north and west, the Bamana (as well as the Minianka, also known as Mamara Senoufo, and a Gur people) than to their Voltaic neighbours the Gurunsi and Mossi, but they should be thought of as a southern extension of the Mandé people who live in what is now Burkina Faso, rather than an intrusive Mandé group that has recently penetrated the region. Although over 41% of Bobo lineages claim a foreign origin, they also say that they are autochthonous.\n\nFarming among the Bobo is of primary importance. Agricultural activity is not merely a way of providing for subsistence among the Bobo, it is the essential component of their day-to-day existence. The major food crops are red sorghum, pearl millet, yams, and maize. They also cultivate cotton, which is sold to textile mills in Koudougou. The imposition of colonial rule and the construction of these mills led to the disintegration of the local co-operative labor systems, which had served to bond the members of Bobo society together.\n\nThe Bobo lineage is the fundamental social building-block. The Bobo are an inherently decentralized group of people. The concept of placing political power in the hands of an individual is foreign to the Bobo. Each village is organized according to the relationship among individual patriline. The lineage unites all descendants of a common ancestor, called the \"wakoma\", a word whose stem, wa-, is a contraction of the Bobo word for house \"wasa\". The Bobo lineage comprises the people who live in a common house. The head of a lineage is called the wakoma or father of the lineage. He may also be called the sapro, which is the term for ancestors. As among other peoples in Burkina, each clan has a totem, so that when a Bobo introduces himself he gives his given name, then his clan name, followed by the totem that he respects.\n\nThe creator god is called Wuro. He cannot be described and is not represented by sculptures. Bobo cosmogony describes the creation of the world by Wuro and the ordering of his creations. He is responsible for the ordering of all things in the world into opposing pairs: man/spirits, male/female, village/bush, culture/nature and so on.\nThe balances between forces as they were created by Wuro are precarious, and it is easy for men to throw the forces out of balance. Farming, for instance, can unbalance the precarious equilibrium between culture/nature and village/bush when the crops are gathered in the bush and brought into the village.\nFor the Bobo people there are two important epochs. The time of Wuro, when the universe was created and the historical time, when Wuro gave man his son Dwo.\n\n\n"}

His schools, famine relief centers, and medical service transformed care in the region.\n\nBorn and raised in Easington in County Durham, England, Thompson attended the College of Islington for brief medical training and was later accepted as a missionary by the Church Mission Society. He was deployed to Kherwara, India, where he spent nearly 20 years living and working, ultimately dedicating his life to the plight of the Bhils.\n\nAs a doctor, teacher, reverend and philanthropist, Thompson worked to treat cholera, leprosy, the Bubonic plague, ophthalmia, malaria, rheumatism and fever. During his medical missionary career, Thompson laid the foundation for later medical missions in the Bhil region by establishing primary schools, dispensaries, relief centers and orphanages, pioneering Christianity to the Bhils, and training several Bhils in medicine. Besides his medical work, Thompson was also interested in diminishing the communication gap between the Bhils and the Europeans, which eventually led him to publish the first grammar and vocabulary book in the Bhili language as well as a prayer book.\n\nReverend Charles Stewart Thompson was born on 17 August 1851, in Easington in County Durham, England, as the fourth of six children. Thompson grew up in a middle class environment. His father, George Thompson, was a farmer, and his mother, Elizabeth Thompson, was a stay-at-home mother. His family was in the evangelical wing of the Anglican Church and attended their local village church, the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, on Sundays.\n\nAfter three years of training at the College of Islington in London, he was accepted as a missionary by the Church Mission Society (CMS). In June 1880, he was ordained as a deacon and in October 1880, he was ordained as a priest.\n\nThompson was not married when he left for the Bhil mission and never married.\n\nIn 1880, then age 29, Charles Stewart Thompson left England in response to an urgent invitation from Bishop Edward Bickersteth, the Vicar of Christ Church, Hempstead, at the time. An urgent request from Mrs. Rundall, daughter of Bishop Bickersteth, had been sent for a missionary after Rundall saw the poor conditions of the Bhils. With a £1000 donation from Bishop Bickersteth, Thompson was sent by the Church Mission Society (CMS) of England to head a new missionary station in Kherwara. He first stayed in Udaipur under Dr. James Shepard of the Rajputana Presbyterian Mission in order to learn Hindi, and a year later, moved to Kherwara, a small village in Rajasthan 80 kilometers south of Udaipur, on 27 November 1880 to officially begin his mission.\n\nCharles Thompson's mission was to establish the first Anglican mission to the Bhils, a \"primitive tribe\" inhabiting this Indian region.\n\nHowever, he soon learned that this would be no easy task. The relationship between the already present British doctors there and the Bhils was quite poor. When the British had arrived, they had introduced a new system of medicine known as \"Angreji Dawa\" (English medicine) to the Bhils. They had believed that the Bhil's primitive beliefs in regard to health and healing would disappear once they realized the superiority of English medicine. However, the Bhils continued to strongly support their beliefs in the supernatural origins of disease. The Bhils perceived surgery as attempted murder—one of the British army doctors was so desperate to have patients that he offered financial compensation to induce Bhils to come to his practice and resorted to carrying out operations without proper consent. Word quickly spread of how English doctors were violating the bodies and lives (physical and spiritual) of the Bhils, and this led to a complete loss of trust in Europeans and rejection of English medicine.\n\nThompson had planned to use his medical work as a way of connecting with the Bhils in order to further his religious message. He had taken rudimentary medical training in England and in his time in Udaipur, he had observed Dr. James Shepard in his medical work just for this purpose. This clearly did not go to plan, as he was viewed with similar suspicions from the Bhils. When he went into the village, the Bhils hid and fled out of fear.\n\nIn addition to this lack of trust in European medicine, a major Bhil revolt occurred in March 1881 due to census operations being carried out, making Thompson's mission even more difficult to carry out. The Bhils saw the counting of their people as a bad omen, understanding that this counting would open the door to greater surveillance and control, which also implied higher taxes. In response to this revolt, the army of Mewar marched through the rebellious villages and slaughtered the Bhils and burned their homes down, worsening the reputation of the Europeans to the Bhils.\n\nHowever, Thompson was not easily deferred. On 7 November 1881, a Bhil approached Thompson in his bungalow, asking for treatment for his deafness. The next day, Thompson visited a nearby Bhil village. It was not easy convincing the Bhils to allow him to treat them because at first, they refused to come anywhere near Thompson. But his breakthrough occurred when a helped named Masih Charan joined Thompson and acted as his interpreter. Charan and Thompson decided to focus on Obri, a village 5 kilometers from Kherwara. Every day, they would set up a makeshift clinic under a shady tree and this proved successful. News spread of how Thompson's remedies were effective, and soon Thompson was visiting every village within a 7 kilometer radius of Kherwara. He would start his day at 7 in the morning and end it in the evening. His plan of using medicine to connect with the Bhils was a success.\n\nFor 16 years, until 1896, he traveled, often alone, to villages and treated the Bhils' complaints on the spot. Thompson did not record the number of patients that he treated or their specific afflictions \"for fear of raising silly suspicions in the Bheel’s dark mind\" that he was trying to injure or perform rituals on them. Throughout his travels, Thompson established several hospitals and dispensaries—notable ones being those in Kherwara and Lusadiya. Here, Thompson did what no other doctor had accomplished before him: he set the scene for a new kind of British doctor, the medical missionary, and opened the Bhils' eyes to the benefits of \"Agreji Dawa (English medicine).\"\n\nThompson established 12 schools in total. He raised money amongst the local native noblemen in order to establish two mission schools in Kherwara, eight outstations northeast of Kherwara (some of which were a rest-house and schoolhouse in Bilaria, a two-roomed house and schoolhouse in Lusaria, a rest-house and schoolhouse in Kotra), a school in Lusadia and a school in Biladiya. Thompson also published the first grammar and vocabulary book, Rudiments of the Bhili Language (1895), in the Bhil dialect.\n\nThompson's first establishments were in Kherwara. He had collected material to build a school and dispensary there. The mission school was initially run by a catechist, Masih Charan, the same interpreter who helped Thompson make his breakthrough in Obri. Of the 7 Bhil pupils that were the school's first students, 3 dropped out. However, the remaining four went on to become very promising. One became the schoolmaster and the second Thompson's medical assistant. This second pupil, a young man, sometimes accompanied Thompson on his travels to Bhil villages. Initially illiterate, the young man not only learned medicine, but also was able to learn enough to read the New Testament. The third pupil became Thompson's house servant and the last became the mission errand runner.\n\nThompson's mission school grew when other young Bhils joined, hearing about the success of the first pupils. The school received R.s. 2.8.0 a month for food and clothing. To accompany this mission school, Thompson also opened a school for girls.\n\nBy the end of 1884, Thompson established 8 more outstations, north east of Kherwara. In November 1884, Reverend G. Litchfield, deployed by the Church Mission Society to the Bhil mission after seeing Thompson's success, arrived and handled Thompson's work in Kherwara and the outstations, as Thompson traveled south and west, hoping to expand and open outstations there. In 1886, Litchfield stated that four to five hundred Bhils came each month for medical treatment.\n\nUnder Thompson's guidance, Litchfield improved the infrastructure in Kherwara by building a new dispensary, a schoolhouse and a home for the Christian master and the twenty Bhil men who would be trained to run schools and dispense medicine at the outstations. By 1899, there were seven Bhil masters and assistant masters working in the mission schools.\n\nThompson focused on the village of Lusadiya in particular, feeling that the Bhils there would be more open to the message of Christianity. In May 1886, Thompson arrived in Lusadiya. According to an interview with Surjibhai Timothibhai Suvera in Lucidia, Christians in Lusadiya can still remember when Thompson arrived and pitched his tent under a large banyan tree. Surjibhai's grandfather was a convert of Thompson's.\n\nBy December, Thompson had established a school building and hospital in Lusadiya. 45 young boys were registered to attend the school. The Lusadiya mission school was a success. When the chief minister of Idar visited, he was greatly impressed by the schoolmaster and the Bhil pupils. He was amazed by the pronunciation, accents and fluency of the young scholars. The minister even suggested that Thompson open a school for girls.\n\nIn April 1887, Thompson established a school, dispensary and mission house in the village of Biladiya.\n\nReverend Charles Stewart Thompson held strong beliefs in individual conversion. He advocated personal faith, moral self cleansing, and Bible study. Before accepting anyone as a convert, he had very strict criteria and tests the would-be convert needed to pass before baptism. First, they needed to prove that they conformed to the social and cultural values of the missionaries. For example, males promised to never have more than one wife. They had to agree to accept European medicine and renounce their previous beliefs in Bhil treatment. The would-be convert also needed to prove that they were self-sufficient. This way, any Bhils who wanted to convert simply for food or a job were eliminated. These tough demands meant that it would be many years until Thompson baptized his first Bhil.\n\nIn 1882, Charles Stewart Thompson began to translate the Gospel for the Bhils, in order to help them understand the Christian message. It was said that many of his Bhil pupils in his mission schools were Christian at heart. However, none had the courage to be baptized, fearing social ostracism.\n\nCharles Stewart Thompson achieved his first convert on 15 December 1889, almost a decade after his arrival. The first converts were an older man named Sukha Damor, his wife Hirki, and their four children. Sukha had accompanied Thompson on a few of his tours and had actually helped Thompson make his initial contact with the Kherwara villages back in November 1881. Sukha had been told by his fellow Bhils and friends that if he converted, he would be disowned, but he was firm in his Christian beliefs and sought baptism anyway.\n\nAfter Sukha's baptism, others soon followed. Another notable convert was Premji Hurji Patel, who was in fact a pupil at one of Thompson's mission schools in Kherwara. His family strongly objected his conversion and even tried to poison him. Premji was baptized in 1890 and became a lay preacher of the Bhil mission.\n\nBy 1895, Thompson had converted 24 Bhils. Eventually, he pioneered Christianity in the Sabarkantha district, in Lusadiya, Biladiya, Ghoradar, Sarasu, Kotra and Baulia.\n\nAfter fifteen and a half years of service, Thompson took furlough in 1896. While in England, he desperately attempted to persuade the Church Mission Society to send more doctors and nurses to the mission. He claimed that thousands of Bhils were dying in need of medical aid. “Nowhere, perhaps, in the world would a healing hand touch a greater sore.” — Charles Stewart Thompson to the Church Mission Society\n\nThompson returned from Britain to India in November 1899 once he heard about the terrible Chappania Famine afflicting the Bhils region. He volunteered to take on the task of famine-relief and ultimately laid down his life to that cause.\n\nWhen Thompson returned, he found that the missionary who had been left in charge, Arthur Outram, was sick with malaria and the authorities of the Mewar state had provided close to no relief for the famine. Thompson took matters into his own hands. He ordered sheds to be built to house the Bhils, started food kitchens, opened a girls’ orphanage and ordered grain from Northern India. By December 1899, about 50 Bhils were under Thompson's care in Kherwara, most of which were children.\n\nOnce he saw that the village of Kherwara was provided for, Thompson appointed Outram in charge and he toured other outstations in order to provide the same relief measures there. When he arrived at other villages, he found that many of the Bhil men had fled, leaving only women and children. He noted that everywhere he went, he was surrounded by masses of starving children.\n\nBy mid-January, Thompson had set up seven relief centers, feeding over 700 Bhili children and some adults. The children were also attending the mission schools. For example, in Kotada, the mission school's population had increased from 3 to 51 in a few weeks. Thompson also opened an orphanage in Biladiya.\n\nHe helped alleviate the Bhils of their starvation and disease by converting his primary day schools into relief centers. He also opened 6 children's kitchens that provided food for over 700 Bhili children and some adults.\n\nBy April 1900, he had opened 15 relief centers in total and was feeding 5500 children, twice daily, that without his efforts would have been either dead or starving. He planned to open 5 more kitchens, which never occurred due to his untimely death. Thompson became a voice for the Bhils, demanding relief and government aid on their behalf.\n\nCharles Stewart Thompson died at age 48 on 19 May 1900, during his efforts to relieve the famine-stricken Bhils from their suffering. He had fallen ill from cholera and in an effort to get him to European aid, Bhil people carried Thompson for 9 hours on the road to Kherwara. He passed away under a tree at noon and was buried at Kanbai, 12 miles from Kherwara.\n\nCharles Stewart Thompson's death, while tragic, became a source of inspiration for the Bhil mission. He was acclaimed as the founding father who had laid down his life for the salvation of the Bhil. Inspired by Thompson's self-sacrifice, many volunteers came forward to help with the Bhil mission. Reverend E. P. Herbert, who had replaced Thompson during his furlough, returned once more. Mr. J.C. Harrison of the Gond Mission also volunteered to take up the task of famine relief. Four clergymen and A.H. Bull, a female missionary who eventually ran the girl's orphanage in Kherwara, offered their services as well.\n\nIn addition to his 12 elementary schools, dispensaries, relief centers and orphanages, there now exists a school named in Thompson's memory, The Thompson Memorial School, in Kherwara.\n"}

The Chinese Argentine community is one of the fastest growing communities in Argentina. As of 2010, the community was made up of 120,000 people.\n\nSince the 20th century, the Chinese in Argentina came in three waves. The first wave of immigrants came from small coastal towns between 1914–1949. The second wave of immigrants arrived from Taiwan in the 1980s and over the years, they have become accustomed to the porteño lifestyle. A considerable number of people from Hong Kong and the southern coastal region of China immigrated during the second wave. The third wave came in the 1990s, hailing mostly from China, mostly from the less developed province of Fujian. This group is filled with young drifters who came often through the illegal smuggling route originating in China's Fujian Province. However, many of the small supermarkets that are present in many neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires come from the community present during the third wave of immigration. \n\nRecently, there has been a fourth and newer wave of Chinese immigration who are mostly ambitious and educated members of China’s growing middle-class who are looking to find their place in China’s growing economy. Young employees of Chinese companies have recently arrived to work for at least two years. Today, many Chinese Argentines usually run \"supermercados chinos\" (Chinese supermarkets), which dominate the second tier of grocery stores in Buenos Aires. \"Tintorerías\" (Dry Cleaners) for laundry are also a common Chinese-run business.\n\nSince the Argentine economic crisis, many small Chinese-owned businesses have faced significant crime. Robberies are frequent, with one Chinese supermarket reportedly robbed up to 14 times in one year. Also, stories of family members shot at gunpoint in their store are not uncommon. Also, tensions have arisen with other immigrant groups as well.\n\nIn June 2006, the union of truck drivers began a boycott of Chinese-owned stores. This was due to an alleged gun-related incident between a driver and a store owner, which involved illegal firearms. Shortages in stores were reported due to a lack of deliveries until the boycott was officially lifted the following month.\n\nBuenos Aires' Chinatown is a largely commercial section two blocks long in the barrio of Belgrano, Buenos Aires. This neighborhood contains several Chinese restaurants, grocery stores, and a Buddhist temple. It is the heart of the Chinese community in Argentina. The neighborhood began to develop in the 1980s when newly arrived Taiwanese and Chinese immigrants settled in this area. The neighborhood is also known for its Chinese New Year celebrations.\n\n\n"}

Reid.\nReid, a sometime commentator for National Public Radio, lived with his wife, son, and two daughters in Japan for five years as Tokyo bureau chief for the Washington Post. This book draws on his experiences during that time. He argues that the Asian Dragon economies have built modern industrial societies featuring the safest streets, the best schools, and the most stable families in the world. Reid credits this success to the ethical values of Chinese philosopher Confucius, who taught the value of \"ren\" (harmony) and the Ethic of Reciprocity.\n\nUpon arriving, he reported, he and his family found themselves \"smack in the middle of a fundamental shift in world history—a basic realignment of global stature and political power... we found ourselves in the Asian century.\" They found that Asian societies dealt more successfully with issues of crime, drug use, family, education, and equality of wealth.\n\nThe reviews welcomed the book but carried on a discussion of the issues behind it. Kirkus Reviews found it a \"readable if superficial analysis of the moral basis of east Asian society.\" In the \"Washington Post\", China scholar Judith Shapiro drew on her own experience living in China to discuss Reid's emphasis on social values over individualism. Frank Gibney, a long-time Japan Hand, lauded Reid for focusing on Confucian values, but thought his view too rosy: Japan is a land where \"conformity is inbred -- no need to be enforced -- and where the ethics of social relationships become a binding morality from which there is almost no escape.\" The Japanese electorate, Gibney held, \"sold its collective soul to a corrupt, faction-ridden political party, backed by a decadent father-knows-best bureaucracy that has yet to grasp the virtues of real free enterprise.\" Another reviewer wrote that the \"so-called social miracle is a glossy caricature—psychologically, culturally,and statistically—of the very people he hopes to defend.\" It would be nice to think, he continued, that Japanese society \"thrives on an immutable culture built on loyalty, civility, and the value of a stable, hardworking community.\" But Reid neglects political structure and historical situation; the Japan that he saw was produced by war, the American Occupation, and postwar consensus building, not Confucius.\n\n"}

The large Kosovar diaspora which had built up in Western Europe during the 1990s combined with the political instability created ideal conditions for Kosovo to become \"Europe's crime hub\"; well into the 2000s, Kosovo remained associated with both ethnic conflict and organized crime.\nA Kosovo Police service has been built up under UN administration beginning in 1999, reaching its operational force of 7,000 officers in 2004, and further expanded to 9,000 by 2010.\nThe deplorable crime rate led to an additional deployment of civilian law enforcement resources of the European Union to Kosovo under the name of European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo in 2008.\nOriginally scheduled for two years, the duration of the deployment was extended twice, as of September 2012 scheduled to last until 2014.\n\nAccording to the \"Kosovo 2012 Crime and Safety Report\" by the US Department of State (intended as an advisory to US nationals travellin abroad),\n\nThe number of reported murders rose 80% from 136 in 2000 to 245 in 2001. The number of reported arsons rose 140% from 218 to 523 over the same period.\nThe number of noted serious crimes increased between 1999 and 2000.\nDuring the 2000s, it has been \"starting to resemble the same patterns of other European cities\".\n\nUNMIK pointed out that the rise in reported incidents might simply correspond to an increased confidence in the police force (i.e., more reports) rather than more actual crime.\nAccording to the UNODC, by 2008, murder rates in Kosovo had dropped by 75% in five years.\n\nResidual landmines and other unexploded ordnance remain in Kosovo, although all roads and tracks have been cleared. Caution when travelling in remote areas is advisable.\n\nEven though stabilization started later, in Kosovo, statistics are able to show that violent and organised crime in Kosovo is in a steady decline. According to Council of Europe Organised Crime Situation Report, 82% of all the organised crime investigations in Kosovo, up until 2005, involved trafficking in human beings. The other major 15% were investigations on extortion.\n\nIn 2005 the U.N Drug report has stated that organised crime in Kosovo controlled the heroin market in the region. The 2007 report identified them as new developers of the importation and distribution of South American cocaine within the region.\n\nThere are several institutions that are battling organized crime including EULEX, KFOR, and Kosovo Police. Currently, the main organised crime activity operates in north Kosovo.\n\nKosovo is extremely vulnerable to organised crime and thus to money laundering. In 2000, international agencies estimated that the Kosovo drug mafia was supplying up to 40% of the heroin sold in Europe and North America. Due to the 1997 unrest in Albania and the Kosovo War in 1998–1999 ethnic Albanian traffickers enjoyed a competitive advantage, which has been eroding as the region stabilises.\nAccording to a 2008 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, overall, ethnic Albanians, not only from Kosovo, supply 10 to 20% of the heroin in Western Europe, and the traffic has been declining.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, there were 175.84 kg of Heroin seized, 17.34 kg of Cocaine seized and a total of 286.89 kg of Cannabis seized. Out of the three main smuggling paths for Europe, Kosovo is in only one of the chains. It acts as one of the transit countries between Afghanistan and Italy.\n\nIncreasing amounts of heroin smuggled are retained in Kosovo for use by local clients. The year 2007 marked a slight increase in the street price of heroin (from EUR 21 to EUR 25 per 1 gram), but the price remained the same, with no increase, in 2008. The typical purity level of street heroin is about 1%. The table below shows seizures of Heroin from 2007-2010.\n\nCocaine seems to arrive in Kosovo through postal deliveries or couriers from Serbia and/or South American countries, which are traditionally known for their cocaine production. It is first sent to Italy or Greece and usually in small quantities. The price for 1 gram of cocaine varied from EUR 45 to EUR 65 in 2007 and from EUR 50 to EUR 70 in 2008. The table below shows seizures of Cocaine from 2007-2010.\n\nCannabis is the only narcotic plant that is cultivated widely in Kosovo, for domestic use primarily. According to the Kosovo Police, during the 2007–10 periods, the cultivation of cannabis was spread in most parts of the country’s territory. The table below shows seizures of cannabis from 2007-2010.\nOrgan theft in Kosovo (sometimes also known as the \"yellow house\" case) refers to alleged organ harvesting and killing of an indeterminate number of \"disappeared\" people. Various sources estimate that the number of victims ranges from a \"handful\", up to 50, and between 24 and 100. The victims are believed to be mostly ethnic Serbian men from Kosovo, allegedly killed by perpetrators with strong links to elements of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in 1999. By 2011, about 1,900 \"disappeared\" people (about two-thirds of them ethnic Albanians) still remained missing from the Kosovo conflict.\n\nIn 2010, a report by Swiss prosecutor Dick Marty to the Council of Europe (CoE) uncovered \"credible, convergent indications\" of an illegal trade in human organs going back over a decade, including the deaths of a \"handful\" of Serb captives allegedly killed for this purpose. On 25 January 2011, the report was endorsed by the CoE, which called for a full and serious investigation. Since the issuance of the report, however, senior sources in the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) and many members of the European Parliament have expressed serious doubts regarding the report and its foundations, believing Marty failed to provide \"any evidence\" concerning the allegations. A EULEX special investigation was launched in August 2011.\n\nKosovo is no longer a transit place or market for illegal weapons smuggling.\nFrom 1999 until 2005, 15,432 illegal guns have been seized or collected from civilians in Kosovo.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, the aftermath of the war resulted in an increase in the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation. According to the IOM data, in 2000–2004, Kosovo was consistently ranked fourth or fifth among the countries of Southeastern Europe by number of human trafficking victims, after Albania, Moldova, Romania and sometimes Bulgaria.\n\nKosovo Police () is the police law enforcement agency of the Republic of Kosovo. The Police Force was initially formed in 1999, where the first candidates began training on 6 September. The first generation of police officers consisted of 176 members.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that \"Kosovo probably has the highest concentration of security personnel in the world\". In 2008, there were a total of 26,233 security personnel, with 8,834 of them being Kosovo Police Officers.\n\nAs of 2013, the Police Force of Kosovo has a total of 51 stations across Kosovo, divided into 6 regions, which are: Priština, Peja, Mitrovica, Prizren, Gjilan and Ferizaj.\n\nDistinguishing between crimes as such and ethnically motivated crimes is difficult. Because of that, there are no reliable figures concerning inter-ethnic crime. Another major problem in exploring these crimes is the inconsistency between UNMIK data and the Kosovo Police.\n\nThere is a lot of tension between Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Albanians in the North, in the region Mitrovica. The Bridge that links the south part of the city with the north part of the city has become a stage for violence between the two ethnic groups. Such incidents as violence against the two ethnic groups are not as common in other parts of Kosovo.\n\n"}
{"id": "95250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95250", "title": "Development of the human body", "text": "Development of the human body\n\nHuman development is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the ovary of a female is penetrated by sperm. The egg then lodges in the uterus, where an embryo and later fetus develop until birth. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through childhood, adolescence, and through adulthood to senility, and are referred to as the process of ageing.\n\nDevelopment before birth, or prenatal development () is the process in which an embryo and later fetus develops during gestation. Prenatal development starts with fertilization, the first stage in embryogenesis which continues in fetal development until birth.\n\nFertilization occurs when the sperm successfully enters the ovum's membrane. The chromosomes of the sperm combine with those of the egg to form a single cell, called a zygote, and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences. The germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization, through the development of the early embryo, up until implantation. The germinal stage is over at about 10 days of gestation.\n\nThe zygote contains a full complement of genetic material and develops into the embryo. Briefly, embryonic developments have four stages: the morula stage, the blastula stage, the gastrula stage, and the neurula stage. Prior to implantation, the embryo remains in a protein shell, the zona pellucida, and undergoes a series of cell divisions, called mitosis. A week after fertilization the embryo still has not grown in size, but hatches from the zona pellucida and adheres to the lining of the mother's uterus. This induces a decidual reaction, wherein the uterine cells proliferate and surround the embryo thus causing it to become embedded within the uterine tissue. The embryo, meanwhile, proliferates and develops both into embryonic and extra-embryonic tissue, the latter forming the fetal membranes and the placenta. In humans, the embryo is referred to as a fetus in the later stages of prenatal development. The transition from embryo to fetus is arbitrarily defined as occurring 8 weeks after fertilization. In comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a set of progressively developing internal organs. A nearly identical process occurs in other species.\n\nHuman embryogenesis refers to the development and formation of the human embryo. It is characterised by the process of cell division and cellular differentiation of the embryo that occurs during the early stages of development. In biological terms, human development entails growth from a one-celled zygote to an adult human being. Fertilisation occurs when the sperm cell successfully enters and fuses with an egg cell (ovum). The genetic material of the sperm and egg then combine to form a single cell called a zygote and the germinal stage of prenatal development commences. Embryogenesis covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus.\nThe germinal stage refers to the time from fertilization through the development of the early embryo until implantation is completed in the uterus. The germinal stage takes around 10 days. During this stage, the zygote begins to divide, in a process called cleavage. A blastocyst is then formed and implanted in the uterus. Embryogenesis continues with the next stage of gastrulation, when the three germ layers of the embryo form in a process called histogenesis, and the processes of neurulation and organogenesis follow.\n\nIn comparison to the embryo, the fetus has more recognizable external features and a more complete set of developing organs. The entire process of embryogenesis involves coordinated spatial and temporal changes in gene expression, cell growth and cellular differentiation. A nearly identical process occurs in other species, especially among chordates.\n\nA fetus is a stage in the human development considered to begin nine weeks after fertilization. In biological terms, however, prenatal development is a continuum, with many defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. A fetus is also characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final location.\n\nThe fetus and embryo develop within the uterus, an organ that sits within the pelvis of the mother. The process the mother experiences whilst carrying the fetus or embryo is referred to as pregnancy. The placenta connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, thermo-regulation, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply; to fight against internal infection; and to produce hormones which support pregnancy. The placenta provides oxygen and nutrients to growing fetuses and removes waste products from the fetus's blood. The placenta attaches to the wall of the uterus, and the fetus's umbilical cord develops from the placenta. These organs connect the mother and the fetus. Placentas are a defining characteristic of placental mammals, but are also found in marsupials and some non-mammals with varying levels of development. The homology of such structures in various viviparous organisms is debatable, and in invertebrates such as Arthropoda, is analogous at best.\n\nChildhood is the age span ranging from birth to adolescence. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of toddlerhood (learning to walk), early childhood (play age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty through post-puberty). Various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation.\n\n\nThe Tanner stages can be used to approximately judge a child's age based on physical development.\n\nPuberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.\n\nOn average, girls begin puberty around ages 10–11 and end puberty around 15–17; boys begin around ages 11–12 and end around 16–17. The major landmark of puberty for females is menarche, the onset of menstruation, which occurs on average between ages 12 and 13; for males, it is the first ejaculation, which occurs on average at age 13. In the 21st century, the average age at which children, especially girls, reach puberty is lower compared to the 19th century, when it was 15 for girls and 16 for boys. This can be due to any number of factors, including improved nutrition resulting in rapid body growth, increased weight and fat deposition, or exposure to endocrine disruptors such as xenoestrogens, which can at times be due to food consumption or other environmental factors. Puberty which starts earlier than usual is known as precocious puberty, and puberty which starts later than usual is known as delayed puberty.\n\nNotable among the morphologic changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of secondary sex characteristics, the \"filling in\" of the child's body; from girl to woman, from boy to man.\n\nBiologically, an adult is a human or other organism that has reached sexual maturity. In human context, the term \"adult\" additionally has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. In contrast to a \"minor\", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. The typical age of attaining adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.\n\nHuman adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult.\n\nDevelopment of human organs and organ systems begins in the embryo and continues throughout the human lifespan.\n\n"}

Most of these South and Southeast Asian migrants travel willingly to Oman with the expectation of employment in domestic service or as low-skilled workers in the country’s construction, agriculture, or service sectors. Some of them subsequently face conditions indicative of forced labor, such as the withholding of passports and other restrictions on movement, non-payment of wages, long working hours without food or rest, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. Labor recruitment agencies and their sub-agents in migrants’ original communities in South Asia, as well as labor brokers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and Iran, may deceive workers into accepting work that in some instances constitutes forced labor. Many of these agencies provide false contracts for employment either with fictitious employers or at fictitious wages, charge workers high recruitment fees (often exceeding $1,000) at high rates of interest, and urge workers to enter Oman on tourist visas. Oman is also a destination and transit country for women from China, India, Morocco, Eastern Europe, and South Asia who may be forced into commercial sexual exploitation, generally by nationals of their own countries. Male Pakistani laborers, and others from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and East Asia, transit Oman en route to the UAE; some of these migrant workers are exploited in situations of forced labor upon reaching their destination.\n\nThe Government of Oman does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government’s prosecution and conviction of trafficking offenders under its anti-trafficking legislation demonstrated an increased commitment to combating trafficking during the reporting period. Omani authorities continued to lack comprehensive procedures to proactively identify trafficking victims among undocumented migrants and women in prostitution.\n\nU.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2 Watchlist\" in 2017.\n\nThe Omani government made clear progress in its law enforcement efforts against sex trafficking over the last year. Royal Decree No. 126/2008, the Law Combating Human Trafficking, prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of three to 15 years’ imprisonment, in addition to financial penalties. These punishments are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes. A legally enforceable circular prohibits employers’ withholding of migrant workers’ passports, a practice contributing to forced labor; the circular, however, does not specify penalties for noncompliance, and this practice continues to be widespread.\n\nThe Government of Oman indicted nine Omanis and 13 foreigners for trafficking in seven cases during the reporting period. Oman convicted one Omani for labor trafficking and another Omani for involuntary manslaughter after forcing an expatriate to work on a fishing vessel. The victim was pushed from the boat, hit his head, and drowned; the case was awaiting final sentencing. The remaining six cases involved trafficking for sexual exploitation; two of these cases were still in progress. Of the four cases completed, nine people were convicted of trafficking and given sentences ranging from two years’ imprisonment, to seven years’ imprisonment with a fine of $26,000. Five people were convicted of trafficking related crimes, and one person was acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\nIn February 2010, the Royal Oman Police conducted a week-long seminar for police, public prosecutors, and judges led by a counter-trafficking expert. The seminar promoted awareness on trafficking and included sessions on victim identification. The Police Academy, public prosecution training center, and police officers’ institute trained government officials on human trafficking; this training was incorporated into the initial police training curriculum.\n\nThe Government of Oman made some progress protecting victims of human trafficking. Overall, the government continued to lack formal procedures to proactively identify victims of trafficking among all vulnerable groups, including migrants detained for immigration violations and women in prostitution. Omani authorities made some efforts, however, to identify victims among particular groups. For example, Ministry of Manpower (MOM) representatives interviewed all employees who ran away from sponsors to determine if they experienced a labor violation, and the MOM had a mechanism in place to identify trafficking victims as part of inspections of private companies. Immigration officials also interviewed all migrant workers leaving Oman to determine if there were outstanding labor complaints. However, it is unknown how many victims were identified using these methods.\n\nThe government placed identified trafficking victims into government-run shelter facilities. The country continued to lack permanent shelter facilities to provide protection services to both labor and sex trafficking victims.\n\nHowever, during the reporting period, the government provided shelter, legal and medical assistance, and psychological care to 21 identified sex trafficking victims at a small shelter in Muscat, and rented villas in other areas of Oman. The government encourages potential trafficking victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of crimes against them. Due to a lack of comprehensive victim identification procedures, Oman may not have ensured expatriates subjected to forced labor and prostitution were not inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked. Government officials indicated the government paid for airfare and spending money for the victims to return home if they wished at the completion of legal procedures. One hundred and sixty MOM labor inspectors received ILO training on victim identification during inspections of private companies.\n\nThe government made some progress in preventing human trafficking. Oman published amendments via Royal Decree 63/2009 to Omani Labor Law 35/2003 in November 2009. While the amendments are meant to combat illegal “free” visas which may contribute to human trafficking, they did not loosen the restrictions on expatriate workers working for anyone other than their sponsor. The amendments also provided further protections to employees who are unfairly terminated.\n\nIn 2009, MOM’s labor inspectorate inspected 2,226 business establishments representing 36 percent of expatriate workers in Oman. Education on human trafficking took place at 41 percent of the visited sites. Oman continued to distribute brochures in multiple languages highlighting the rights and services to which workers are legally entitled to source country embassies and to new migrant laborers at airports, recruitment agencies, and in their places of work. Other brochures in multiple languages were distributed, summarizing the trafficking law and providing detailed information on how to report a trafficking crime and the types of assistance available to victims. The National Committee to Combat Human Trafficking (NCCHT) met regularly during the reporting period. In October 2009, the NCCHT launched a website, which received over 25,000 visits a month, and provided information on pertinent legislation, tools for identifying trafficking victims, and a method for reporting trafficking cases to the relevant authorities. The NCCHT also launched a trafficking-specific hotline; it received ten calls, primarily related to labor law violations. It also published Oman`s National Plan to Combat Human Trafficking. The government continued its public awareness campaign, which included placement of at least one article or editorial each week in the press about trafficking, press interviews on trafficking, and six hours of radio and two hours of TV on national stations addressing trafficking issues. In April 2010, Oman released its first anti-human trafficking report, which included details on prosecutions, victim care, prevention efforts, and public awareness efforts. The government recently issued a decision to gender segregate massage facilities not associated with hotels; such standalone businesses are often a front for prostitution.\n\nTwelve senior officials from the Government of Oman attended a two-day anti-trafficking workshop led by the ILO in October 2009. In April 2010, the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD) conducted training, in conjunction with UNSAFE, on preventing child trafficking. MoSD also worked with the Oman Women’s Associations to conduct lectures for Omani women on the human trafficking law, with an emphasis on domestic servants. Two members of the NCCHT attended the UNODC conference in Geneva and also attended a conference on trafficking held in Qatar.\n\n"}

{"id": "1301049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1301049", "title": "James Ruse Agricultural High School", "text": "James Ruse Agricultural High School\n\nJames Ruse Agricultural High School (colloquially known as Ruse) is one of four New South Wales Government agricultural high schools. It is a selective, co-educational public high school located at Carlingford, New South Wales, Australia. The school is especially noted for its academic excellence, ranking 1st out of all New South Wales high schools in 2017 for the 27th consecutive year since 1991, as well as 1st in the national government NAPLAN tests across Australia since establishment.\n\nThere are currently approximately 841 students enrolled at James Ruse in Years 7 through to 12. James Ruse is an academically selective high school; admission to James Ruse in Year 7 is only through the Selective High Schools Test, which is open to all Year 6 NSW students. A small number of students from other high schools are accepted in year 9, 10 and 11, through application made directly to the school. Of the student population, around 95% are from a non-English-speaking background, predominantly Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian and Sri Lankan student language groups.\n\nIn 1949 the main part of the school grounds was purchased by the NSW Government for the purpose of Agricultural Education. The school that commenced on this site in 1956 was an annexe of Carlingford District Rural School with Charles Mullavey as the Master in Charge. At that time the school consisted of a wooden five room classroom block, a small staff-room and ablution facilities. By the start of 1958 the school was independent of Carlingford District Rural School and was called the \"Carlingford Junior Agricultural High School\" (reflecting that students could only undertake the first three years of secondary education at the school).\n\nIn 1959 the name of the school was changed to \"Carlingford Agricultural High School\" (to reflect its new full high school status - although there were no actual Fourth and Fifth Year classes at that time). The first Headmaster, James C. Hoskin, and his Deputy Headmaster, Charles Mullavey, commenced duties at the start of that year and in April, the name of the school changed again - this time to \"James Ruse Agricultural High School\".\n\nWhen James Hoskin was studying Agriculture at University, he had become interested in James Ruse due to his significance in the early development of agriculture in Australia, and also because \"both Ruse and I [Hoskin] are of Cornish extraction\". Mr Hoskin questioned the name of the school (Carlingford Agricultural High School) as the school was not serving just the Carlingford area. In April 1959, Mr. Hoskin put forward a proposal to the NSW Department of Education outlining two new names for the school: \"Sydney Agricultural High School\" and \"Ruse Agricultural High School\"; eventually, the Department agreed to a modification of the latter. The school was named to honour prominent late farmer James Ruse.\n\nHoskin soon became synonymous with the school, as he served as headmaster until his retirement at age of 65 in 1978. During this time, the school became established as one of the few public schools that were selective; initially because of its agricultural speciality, then for its reputation as a quality school. For his efforts, Hoskin was awarded the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977 and the Order of Australia for Services to Education in 1990.\n\nThe first group of students to complete the full five years of secondary education at the new high school sat for the Leaving Certificate in 1961. Most of these boys were part of the initial enrolment of 1st Year pupils at the Felton Rd. site, in 1957. James Ruse AHS was originally a boys only school, but gradually became co-educational after an initial intake of 24 female students into Year 11 in 1977.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, James Ruse has undergone an extensive building works program funded by both parents of students and the State and Federal Governments. 1997 saw the completion of Stage 1 of this program (encompassing a new Library block and English classrooms which replaced the old Anderson building, a new block containing Art and HSIE classrooms, the integration of the existing Powe block and the former library into a science block, and the installation of an elevator in the Perrau block to improve wheelchair accessibility).\n\nIn 2000, Stage 2 of the program began with the first building (a 180-seat lecture theatre) completed in early 2001. The Schofield block became part of the program in 2002 after the building was damaged by fires. During the next two years the old Technology Block and the Francis block were demolished due to a white ant infestation, with both blocks being rebuilt and refurnished in 2004. The final stage of the works were underway at the time of the departure of Principal Michael Quinlan, who retired in 2006 after having been Principal since 1992. These developments (including a new music block) continued with the guidance of the new principal, Ms Larissa Treskin.\n\nSix Principals have served at James Ruse Agricultural High School:\n\nJames Ruse Agricultural High School is especially noted for its excellent academic achievements and competitiveness, as well as a near perfect record of all students gaining university admission, especially in medicine, law and science. The school has outperformed every high school in New South Wales in the past 20 years in public university entrance examinations, known in the state as the Higher School Certificate, with a median Universities Admission Index (UAI) of 99.55 in 2004, and 99.20 in 2005 and 2006. \n\nJames Ruse Agricultural High School can be noted for its strong participation in extracurricular and competitive activities, as listed below. In addition, the school has a high level of participation in volunteering and fundraising activities, including World's Greatest Shave and the 40 Hour Famine, and is closely linked with Interact and Amnesty International . Many students have received awards for outstanding participation in community service.\n\nThe school also holds annual sporting carnivals, including the Swimming, Cross-Country and Athletics Carnivals, where students can compete for participation in wider regional competitions, from Zone and Area carnivals to the CHS (Combined High Schools) competition for the top school teams and competitors in NSW. \nJames Ruse participates in a variety of tournaments and competitions with schools in surrounding areas. These include the following activities.\nThere are also many competitive sporting teams, where students compete against other schools in the area, state, or country. Some teams have had the opportunity to compete against sporting teams from overseas.\n\nThe following ensembles offer musical training, and some groups perform at both school and public assemblies. Larger ensembles tour NSW annually to perform throughout the state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school's Student Representative Council was inaugurated in 1960, making it among the first high schools in New South Wales to have such a body. Each year, each roll class elects a Class Captain and Vice-Captain who represent it on the SRC. Larger extracurricular organisations are also entitled to a representative. The SRC as a whole elect a student executive, which consists of a President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary, and Minutes Secretary, by a system first inaugurated in 1990. Through the SRC, students have a one-third representation on the school steering committees (along with parents and staff), and also play a major role in decision-making processes relating to curriculum, building plans, and resource allocation. This group is led by 5 year 11 student executives.\n\nThe first cadet unit in James Ruse AHS was established in 1961, and JRAHSACU usually has a strength of 90 to 140 cadets. JRAHSACU is currently made up of 3 platoons and 2 recruit platoons. The unit conducts a field expedition every term, with a strong emphasis on navigation and hiking. Weekend unit bivouacs are held every term, and 10-day unit-held annual camps offer cadets an intense and exotic hiking adventure. Cadets receive training in: \nThroughout its history, the JRAHSACU has been actively involved in community events, including Hyde Park Memorial Parade, RSL Services, services at local primary schools, and parades in the city. JRAHSACU was awarded the high honour of parading the Duke of Edinburgh's Banner in 2011. The unit participates in annual field exercises held to battalion or brigade (statewide) levels, and has many cadets participate in the annual national Adventure Training Award. An enthusiasm for Cadets continues to exist at rising levels, and the unit has been awarded with numerous formal commendations, unit medals, and Unit Efficiency awards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school teaches agriculture as a compulsory subject from years 7 to 10. Formerly it was also compulsory in Year 11 (with students taking an accelerated version of the HSC course to allow completion within one year). However, following the introduction of a new HSC curriculum by the Board of Studies in 2001, the school made Year 11 optional (with the decision supported by a survey amongst students). Agriculture is a significant part of the school's curriculum, with students undergoing study of the subject both on and off-site, where students study and visit agricultural enterprises both in the Greater Sydney region, with visits to regional horticultural farming enterprises such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show and farms in Bathurst and in Gloucester. There is also great involvement in with other agricultural schools, with the school linked with Yanco Agricultural High School, and previous Head Teacher of Agriculture, Lisle Brown, being the co-author of the \"Dynamic Agriculture\" textbook series, which is extensively used in agriculture in Australian schools.\n\nThe school leases approximately ten hectares of land from the neighbouring electricity sub-station for use in practical agriculture lessons. The farm land is situated north of the general school buildings, extending north to Lynch Close and east to Jenkins Road. The farm is arranged to include a vegetable garden, a classroom, a glasshouse and nursery, a greenhouse, an orchard, experimental plots, an area for field crops and a livestock section, among others. It also contains some riparian land which is currently being monitored and undergoing rehabilitation to its native state by the Streamwatch group (currently working as part of Sydney Water Streamwatch).\n\nA significant amount of the farm land is set aside for student plots. Part of practical agriculture lessons involves students growing and maintaining their own crops, and a practical mark worth 10% of their yearly mark is awarded at the end of term. Mature crops in the students' assigned plots of land are then the students' to take home. In addition to its use for educational purposes, the farm also supplies a wide variety of agricultural produce including: Cattle - Angus stud, paraded annually at the Castle Hill Show by the Cattle Group, and sold at Camden Sales yard; Sheep - First-cross Ewes & Prime Lambs; Eggs - Free-range eggs; Poultry Meat - Broilers raised and sold onsite, Oranges - Washington Navel; Peaches - Flordagold and Sherman's Red varieties; Sweet Corn - Shimmer variety; James Ruse Gold Rose - A privately crossbred rose variety the rights were donated to the school in 1999 in celebration of its 40 years of teaching; Apiary - Honey sold on-site in jars; and Macadamia Nuts. Various groups of students have been set up to look after these, such as the Poultry Squad and a Weather Watcher group to maintain farm records. In the past, the farm also housed Merino and Border Leicester sheep, named the Sharlea Sheep. It was replaced by the Aquaculture venture, silver perch and a crayfish growing system. Now some students also participate in making peach jam and sorbet after the peach harvest.\n\nThe school is situated in Carlingford, a suburb of North-Western Sydney. Its main entrance is located on the southwest corner of the school, with a number of smaller entrances on its southern and western boundaries. The campus is built around a main quadrangle, another cluster of buildings around a smaller quadrangle, with an oval, sporting facilities and the farm to the north of these.\n\nBarrengarry House, the school's main administration block is located near the southwest entrance of the school, adjoining the Senior Common Room and the Library and housing the offices of the principal, deputy principals, head teacher of administration and the administration staff on the lower floor, and the counsellor's office, uniform shop and function rooms on the upper floor. It was originally the home and property of the Felton family, and was built in 1885, with the architect thought to have been Charles Slatyer. The block adjoins a roadway of the same name, both of which are named after the Feltons' estate.\n\nMore commonly known as the \"school hall\", the J.C. Hoskin Auditorium, named after the school's founding principal (see history above), is used as a multi-purpose facility. Along with holding important school assemblies, concerts and the school musical, the hall is also used for examinations (primarily government and senior exams) and it was used for PE classes in the past—this function was largely removed with the construction of the school's new gymnasium in 2017. Ceremonies which celebrate the school's highest achievers are also held annually in the Auditorium.\n\nThe Library Block (or \"L-Block\") was built in 1997 and opened by then NSW Premier Bob Carr as part of the school's building works program, to provide a larger, and more modern and well-equipped library to replace the smaller Shearman Block (now the school's Music block). The block is a two-storey building, with the library occupying the top floor and English classrooms and offices on the bottom floor.\n\nThe Technology Block (or \"T-Block\") is a recent addition to the school campus along with the new Canteen Block, with construction finished in 2005. The wing is a two-storey building with a mix of classrooms, workshops and modern computer labs, and overlooks the gymnasium on its northern side.\n\nThe Cameron Block (or \"C-Block\") is a three-storey building with a variety of classrooms, science labs, computer rooms and lockers. It is also home to the Mathematics Department and is located on one of the edges of the Main Quadrangle. There is also a Drama Room which contains a stage, a hobbit hole with costumes and some other drama-related objects. The topic of Multiple-Disciplinary Communications (MDC) is also frequently taught within the drama room.\n\nThe Powe Block (or \"P-Block\") is a two-storey building connecting L-Block and C-Block which houses most (but not all) of the school's laboratories. Most science lessons are held in this building and the science faculty staff room is located on the first floor. The second storey was constructed in 2012.\n\nF-Block is a single storey building with two rooms that houses agriculture lessons.\n\nBishop Block is a 2 storey building adjacent to the canteen sales. The bottom floor is used as a sports equipment storeroom and the second floor is a single classroom often used for Latin or Japanese classes.\n\nThe JRAHS Gymnasium began construction in late 2016 and opened in 2017. Its lengthy history dates back to the early 2000s and was a subject of comedy within the school community, as one of the longest running jokes used by Prefects/SRC and online 'memes'. Much of the jokes have ceased with the completion and opening of the gymnasium in 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20314797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20314797", "title": "Jivaroan peoples", "text": "Jivaroan peoples\n\nJivaroan peoples refers to groups of indigenous peoples in the headwaters of the Marañon River and its tributaries, in northern Peru and eastern Ecuador. They speak one of the language family of the same name.\n\nThe Jivaro people are famous for their head-hunting raids and shrinking the heads. These raids usually occur once a year in one particular Jivaro neighborhood. The raiding parties usually only attack one homestead per raid, killing the men, spearing the older women to death, and taking younger women as brides.\n\nJivaro also engage in hunting activities. These activities usually involve a husband and wife hunting with a blow gun and poisoned dart, dabbed with the poisonous plant curare, which stops the heartbeat of the animal. Jivaro usually hunt for monkeys and birds, but they do not rely on hunting as their primary food source.\n\nThe principal groups are:\n\nSome have also named the following:\n\nMoreover, the Shiwiar are a group of Achuar speakers living along the Corrientes River, next to Quechua speakers; many Shiwiar also speak this other, unrelated, language.\n\nThe Jivaroan worldview is built upon the idea that both animate and inanimate objects hold souls that cannot be seen by our common eyes. These souls contain power, or karáram, that the Jivaroan people believe can be contained and harnessed within one’s self. Harner talks about these souls, called \"arutam\":“A person is not born with an \"arutam\" soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is considered to be so important to an adult male’s survival that a boy’s parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. By repeatedly killing, one can continually accumulate power through the replacement of old \"arutam\" souls with new ones. This “trade-in” mechanism is an important feature because, when a person has had the same \"arutam\" soul for four or five years, it tends to leave its sleeping possessor to wander nightly through the forest. Sooner or later, while it is thus drifting through the trees, another Jivaro will “steal” it. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to obtain a new soul before the old one begins nocturnal wanderings. This felt need encourages the individual to participate in a killing expedition every few years.”Killing becomes a vital part of the Jivaro culture. Men are only marriageable after becoming hunters within their communities. The more one kills, the more power one has, granting one immunity of death. Violence is a huge part of Jivaroan culture in respect to this type of soul belief. Harner talks about the main systems of belief within the Jivaroan communities: “Jivaro souls beliefs constitute one of four major autonomous systems of verbalized thought so far noted in their culture. The other three are the systems of crop fairy (\"nungui\") beliefs, and kinship system. Since belief in one system is not explicitly based upon belief in another, an adequate understanding of Jivaro soul beliefs can be achieved without recourse to the beliefs regarding nunui, witchcraft, or kinship.”\n\nThe Jivaroan people have a polytheistic religion. The Jivaro god, Tsungi, is the god of shamanism, and the Jivaro goddess, \"Nungüi\", refers to mother earth. \"Nungüi\" is described as being a short and heavy-set woman, dressed in a black dress. According to Jivaro belief; if \"Nungüi\" dances in a woman's garden, it will be productive during the harvest season. Living deep underground, she emerges at night to dance in the gardens. Women sing to \"Nungui\" to ask her to protect the gardens, and they carefully weed the gardens daily to appease her. Jivaro believe in a protective spirit that comes to them through spirit visions. This spirit, known as \"Arutam\" is thought to protect them from injury, disease, and death. The Jivaroan gods and goddesses are deeply tied to nature. There are different creators and gods that explain the origins of man and animal, the occurrence of natural events and relationships that exist in daily life. Their creation myths support their violent culture as “it is dominated by a series of battles among the gods and an essential duality of where people are the victims.” Among the deities are spirits that are known to provide wisdom and protection to the person they are tied to. Some commonly seen animals are the anaconda, \"pangi\", and the giant butterfly \"wampang\". These animals can assist shamans in healing or bewitching people. Through the Jivaroan worldview, it is believed that sickness and death are caused by attacks on one’s spirit by malevolent shamans. The healing shamans will hold \"ayahuasca\" ceremonies and perform different rituals to counteract the work done by witchcraft.\n\nHeadhunting\n\nSee: Shrunken Head\n\nJivaro Gardening\n\nUnlike many other cultures, the Jivaro cultures place more emphasis on gardening (horticulture) than they do on hunting. This is due to the unpredictable nature of hunting in the Amazonian region, where the Jivaro call home. As a result, a ritualistic approach to gardening sprouted from the Jivaro cultures.\n\nDespite the reliable, elaborate system of horticultural development the Jivaro have developed, they still believe the act to be “…as fraught with uncertainty as hunting” as Michael Brown stated in a paper titled, “Aguaruna Jivaro Gardening Magic in Alto Rio Mayo, Peru.” He then went on to say that in order, “To encourage the growth of their cultivated plants they sing magical gardening songs, perform a set of ritual acts when planting a new garden, and observe certain taboos connected with garden work.” Much like similar beliefs and rituals associated with hunting, the Jivaro believe that spirits reside in the plants and they need to be encouraged to grow by various songs, chants, and dances.\n\nDue to the belief of spirits residing in the plants, the garden is regarded as a place of great spiritual significance. Like the inside of a temple, the garden is a place where one receives sanctuary.\n\n\"It is one of the few places where a woman can go alone without attracting curiosity and suspicion. It offers privacy from prying eyes and ears and is therefore the site of a certain amount of intra- and extra-marital sexual activity\" (Brown, 171)\nAyahuasca ceremonies play a large role in the Jivaro culture. These ceremonies are used for healing practices usually directed toward enchanting spirits. Here, Bradley C. Bennett makes note of these healing practices,\"During Healing Ceremony, only shaman and patient drink Natem and will participate in the singing and chanting while the shaman will perform different actions to the patients body thought to heal the spirit.\"The shaman goes about relieving the patient of any harmful spirits that may be attacking his or her body. The Jivaro also believe in an act of what may be considered telling the future or telling time. Bennett makes another note of the Jivaro and their ayahuasca ceremonies, where a Jivaro will hire a shaman tell tell of far away friends and family.\"The Jivaro shamans, Under the influence of ayahuasca, often believe that they are seeing distant relatives or sweethearts. These distant persons apparently have to be individuals with whom the shaman is already acquainted, so that he can \"know whom to look for.\" Also it is normally necessary for the shaman to be already acquainted with the distant locale and the route to get there, and preferably he should know the appearance and location of the house of the person being sought.\" The Jivaro have been practicing these ceremonies for hundreds of years, keeping them held close to their roots. The ceremonies of the ayahuasca brew continue to be practiced this day.\n\nThe Shuar believe that the first being, Tensak, casts a spiritual dart that to curse or heal a person. Bennett recorded that the Tensak \"exists in a higher plane of existence that can be seen when in the shaman state.\" Bennett also observed that, as a shaman works to heal spirits and counter bewitching shamans he will consume Banisteriopsis caapi, tobacco and alcohol to help enhance and fuel his trip from the Natem.\n\nAnthropologists have recognized these languages as distinct peoples, but have called attention to two confounding factors. The first has to do with nomenclature: Jivaroan language speakers typically identify themselves either by their language's word for person (\"shuar\") or by the name of the river on which they live. Consequently, historical sources record either one name for all, or a plethora names of many small Jivaroan tribes, each the name of a different river.\n\nThe second reason has to do with social organization. Prior to Ecuadorian or Peruvian colonization and Christian missionization in the 20th century, the principal unit of Jivaroan social organization was the polygynous matrilocal household or cluster of matrilocally-organized households. Notably, although Jivaroans shared the same language and culture, each household or cluster of matrilocally organized households were politically and economically autonomous. Thus, in 1938 Matthew Stirling commented that:\n\nHe also said that:\nPrior to colonization and the presence of Christian missionaries, Jivaroan speakers were not organized into any stable and clearly bounded polities or ethnic groups.\n\nIn response to European colonization and missionization, Jivaroan speakers have formed nucleated settlements that are organized into political federations: the Federación Interprovincial de Centros Shuar and the Nacionalidad Achuar de Ecuador in Ecuador, and the Organización Central de Comunidades Aguarunas del Alto Marañon and the Consejo Aguaruna y Huambisa in Peru.\n\nThe word \"Jivaro\" is likely a corruption of the indigenous word, Shuar. During the Spanish colonial period, \"Jivaros\" were viewed as the antithesis of civilized. The word Jíbaro thus entered the Spanish language; in Ecuador it is highly pejorative and signifies \"savage\"; outside of Ecuador, especially in Mexico and Puerto Rico, it has come to mean \"rustic.\"\n"}
{"id": "615208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615208", "title": "Karen people", "text": "Karen people\n\nThe Karen, Kayin, Kariang or Yang people ( , , ; \"Per Ploan Poe\" or \"Ploan\" in Pwo Karen and \"Pwa Ka Nyaw\" or \"Kanyaw\" in Sgaw Karen; ) or ) refer to a number of individual Sino-Tibetan language-speaking ethnic groups, many of which do not share a common language or culture. These Karen groups reside primarily in Kayin State, southern and southeastern Myanmar. The Karen make up approximately seven percent of the total Burmese population with approximately five million people. A large number of Karen have migrated to Thailand, having settled mostly on the Thailand–Myanmar border.\n\nThe Karen groups as a whole are often confused with the Padaung tribe, best known for the neck rings worn by their women, but they are just one sub-group of Red Karens (Karenni), one of the tribes of Kayah in Kayah State, Myanmar.\n\nSome of the Karen, led primarily by the Karen National Union (KNU), have waged a war against the central Burmese government since early-1949. The aim of the KNU at first was independence. Since 1976 the armed group has called for a federal system rather than an independent Karen State. In Thailand, they are usually known as ; 'Karen', while in Myanmar, there are known as \"Kayin\".\n\nKaren legends refer to a \"river of running sand\" which ancestors reputedly crossed. Many Karen think this refers to the Gobi Desert, although they have lived in Myanmar for centuries. The Karen constitute the third largest ethnic population in Myanmar, after the Bamars and Shans.\n\n\"Karen\" refers to a heterogeneous lot of ethnic groups that do not share a common language, culture, religion, or material characteristics. A pan-Karen ethnic identity is a relatively modern creation, established in the 19th century with the conversion of some Karen to Christianity and shaped by various British colonial policies and practices and the introduction of Christianity.\n\n\"Karen\" is an Anglicisation of the Burmese word \"Kayin\" (), whose etymology is unclear. The word, which was originally a derogatory term referring to non-Buddhist ethnic groups, may have come from the Mon language, or is a corruption of \"Kanyan\", the name of a vanished civilization.\n\nIn pre-colonial times, the low-lying Burmese and Mon-speaking kingdoms recognised two general categories of Karen, the \"Talaing Kayin\" (), generally lowlanders who were recognised as the \"original settlers\" and essential to Mon court life, and the \"Karen\" (), highlanders who were subordinated or assimilated by the Bamar.\n\nThe Karen people live mostly in the hills bordering the eastern mountainous region and Irrawaddy delta of Myanmar, primarily in Kayin State (formerly Karen State), with some in Kayah State, southern Shan State, Ayeyarwady Region, Tanintharyi Region, Bago Division and in northern and western Thailand.\n\nThe total number of Karen is difficult to estimate. The last reliable census of Myanmar was conducted in 1931. A 2006 VOA article cites an estimate of seven million in Myanmar. There are another 400,000 Karen in Thailand, where they are by far the largest of the hill tribes.\n\nSome Karen have left the refugee camps in Thailand to resettle elsewhere, including in North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia. In 2011, the Karen diaspora population was estimated to be approximately 67,000.\n\nFollowing British victories in the three Anglo-Burmese wars, Myanmar was annexed as a province of British India in 1886. Baptist missionaries introduced Christianity to Myanmar beginning in 1830, and they were successful in converting many Karen. Christian Karens were favoured by the British colonial authorities and were given opportunities not available to the Burmese ethnic majority, including military recruitment and seats in the legislature. Some Christian Karens began asserting an identity apart from their non-Christian counterparts, and many became leaders of Karen ethno-nationalist organisations, including the Karen National Union.\n\nIn 1881 the Karen National Associations (KNA) was founded by western-educated Christian Karens to represent Karen interests with the British. Despite its Christian leadership, the KNA sought to unite all Karens of different regional and religious backgrounds into one organisation. They argued at the 1917 Montagu–Chelmsford hearings in India that Myanmar was not \"yet in a fit state for self-government\". Three years later, after submitting a criticism of the 1920 Craddock Reforms, they won 5 (and later 12) seats in the Legislative Council of 130 (expanded to 132) members. The majority Buddhist Karens were not organised until 1939 with the formation of a Buddhist KNA.\nIn 1938 the British colonial administration recognised Karen New Year as a public holiday.\n\nDuring World War II, when the Japanese occupied the region, long-term tensions between the Karen and Burma turned into open fighting. As a consequence, many villages were destroyed and massacres committed by both the Japanese and the Burma Independence Army (BIA) troops who helped the Japanese invade the country. Among the victims were a pre-war Cabinet minister, Saw Pe Tha, and his family. A government report later claimed the \"excesses of the BIA\" and \"the loyalty of the Karens towards the British\" as the reasons for these attacks. The intervention by Colonel Suzuki Keiji, the Japanese commander of the BIA, after meeting a Karen delegation led by Saw Tha Din, appears to have prevented further atrocities.\n\nThe Karen people aspired to have the regions where they formed the majority turned into a subdivision or \"state\" within Myanmar similar to what the Shan, Kachin and Chin peoples had been given. A goodwill mission led by Saw Tha Din and Saw Ba U Gyi to London in August 1946 failed to receive any encouragement from the British government for any separatist demands.\n\nIn January 1947 a delegation of representatives of the Governor's Executive Council headed by Aung San was invited to London to negotiate for the Aung San–Attlee Treaty, none of the ethnic minority groups was included by the British government. The following month at the Panglong Conference, when an agreement was signed between Aung San as head of the interim Burmese government and the Shan, Kachin and Chin leaders, the Karen were present only as observers; the Mon and Arakanese were also absent.\n\nThe British promised to consider the case of the Karen after the war. While the situation of the Karen was discussed, nothing practical was done before the British left Myanmar. The 1947 Constitution, drawn without Karen participation due to their boycott of the elections to the Constituent Assembly, also failed to address the Karen question specifically and clearly, leaving it to be discussed only after independence. The Shan and Karenni states were given the right to secession after 10 years, the Kachin their own state, and the Chin a special division. The Mon and Arakanese of Ministerial Myanmar were not given any consideration.\n\nIn early February 1947, the Karen National Union (KNU) was formed at a Karen Congress attended by 700 delegates from the Karen National Associations, both Baptist and Buddhist (KNA - founded 1881), the Karen Central Organisation (KCO) and its youth wing, the Karen Youth Organisation (KYO), at Vinton Memorial Hall in Yangon. The meeting called for a Karen state with a seaboard, an increased number of seats (25%) in the Constituent Assembly, a new ethnic census, and a continuance of Karen units in the armed forces. The deadline of 3 March passed without a reply from the British government, and Saw Ba U Gyi, the president of the KNU, resigned from the Governor's Executive Council the next day.\nAfter the war ended, Myanmar was granted independence in January 1948, and the Karen, led by the KNU, attempted to co-exist peacefully with the Burman ethnic majority. Karen people held leading positions in both the government and the army. In the fall of 1948, the Burmese government, led by U Nu, began raising and arming irregular political militias known as \"Sitwundan\". These militias were under the command of Major Gen. Ne Win and outside the control of the regular army. In January 1949, some of these militias went on a rampage through Karen communities.\n\nThe Karen National Union has maintained its structure and purpose from the 1950s onward. The KNU acts as a governmental presence for the Karen people, offering basic social services for those affected by the insurgency, such as Karen refugees or internally displaced Karen. These services include building school systems, providing medical services, regulating trade and commerce, and providing security through the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), the KNU's army.\n\nIn late January 1949, the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Smith Dun, a Karen, was removed from office and imprisoned. He was replaced by the Burmese nationalist Ne Win. Simultaneously a commission was looking into the Karen problem and this commission was about to report their findings to the Burmese government. The findings of the report were overshadowed by this political shift at the top of the Burmese government. The Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO), formed in July 1947, then rose up in an insurgency against the government. They were helped by the defections of the Karen Rifles and the Union Military Police (UMP) units which had been successfully deployed in suppressing the earlier Burmese Communist rebellions, and came close to capturing Yangon itself. The most notable was the Battle of Insein, nine miles from Yangon, where they held out in a 112-day siege till late May 1949.\n\nYears later, the Karen had become the largest of 20 minority groups participating in an insurgency against the military dictatorship in Yangon. During the 1980s, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) fighting force numbered approximately 20,000. After an uprising of the people of Myanmar in 1988, known as the 8888 Uprising, the KNLA had accepted those demonstrators in their bases along the border. The dictatorship expanded the army and launched a series of major offensives against the KNLA. By 2006, the KNLA's strength had shrunk to less than 4,000, opposing what is now a 400,000-man Burmese army. However, the political arm of the KNLA - the KNU - continued efforts to resolve the conflict through political means.\n\nThe conflict continues , with a new KNU headquarters in Mu Aye Pu, on the Burmese–Thai border. In 2004, the BBC, citing aid agencies, estimates that up to 200,000 Karen have been driven from their homes during decades of war, with 160,000 more refugees from Myanmar, mostly Karen, living in refugee camps on the Thai side of the border. The largest camp is the one in Mae La, Tak province, Thailand, where about 50,000 Karen refugees are hosted.\n\nReports as recently as February 2010, state that the Burmese army continues to burn Karen villages, displacing thousands of people.\nMany Karen, including people such as former KNU secretary Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan and his daughter, Zoya Phan, have accused the military government of Myanmar of ethnic cleansing. The U.S. State Department has also cited the Burmese government for suppression of religious freedom.\n\nA 2005 \"New York Times\" article on a report by Guy Horton into depredations by the Myanmar Army against the Karen and other groups in eastern Myanmar stated:\n\nUsing victims' statements, photographs, maps and film, and advised by legal counsel to the UN tribunal on the former Yugoslavia, he purports to have documented slave labour, systematic rape, the conscription of child soldiers, massacres and the deliberate destruction of villages, food sources and medical services.\n\nThroughout the insurgency, hundreds of thousands of Karen fled to refugee camps while many others (numbers unknown) were internally displaced persons within the Karen state. The refugees were concentrated in camps along the Thailand-Myanmar border. According to refugee accounts, the camps suffered from overcrowding, disease, and periodic attacks by the Myanmar army.\n\nAround 400,000 Karen people are without housing, and 128,000 are living in camps on the Thailand-Burma border. According to BMC, \"79% of refugees living in these camps are Karen ethnicity.\" Their lives are restricted in the camps because they usually cannot go out, and the Thai police might arrest them if they do. Employment for the Karen refugees is scarce and risky. Former refugee Hla Wah said, \"No jobs ... So if adults wanted to work, they had to leave quietly without getting caught by Thai police.\" Wah is a Karen refugee who lived in a camp where she went to school and helped her family because her parents sought to go out to work, but they earned little money. Wah suffered from malnutrition because her parents did not have money to buy food for her nine siblings.\n\nBeginning in 2000, the Karen started resettling in the United States and Canada. Many Karen have problems fitting in and adjusting to the new country. \"90% of the Karen refugees reported no knowledge of English or French on arrival.\" Moreover, the Karen have also resettled in the U.S. In 2011-2012, the population was growing fast in Nebraska. The Karen have also resettled in Southern California and central New York.\n\nMu Aye is a young Karen woman who has resettled in San Diego, CA. Aye said, \"After growing up in a place like I did, I wanted to become a nurse. I wanted to help sick people..travel to refugee camps in Thailand and care for people who cannot afford medication.\" Additionally, Eh De Gray, who graduated from San Diego's Crawford High School, wants to go back to the camps and share his knowledge with the school children. Gray said, \"I want to share my knowledge and experiences with them.\"\n\nIn 2014, Ler Htoo was sworn in after graduating from the St. Paul Police Academy in Minnesota, a state in which an estimated 8,500 Karen live, as the first Karen police officer in the United States.\n\nDuring 1994 and 1995, dissenters from the Buddhist minority in the KNLA formed a splinter group of the KNU called the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), and went over to the side of the military junta. As a note, the DKBA split themselves from the KNU due to the KNLA's weak central power. Additionally, the mostly Pwo-speaking Buddhist Karen of the DKBA felt a tension with the KNU, whose leadership consisted for the most part of Sgaw-speaking Christians. The split is believed to have led to the fall of the KNU headquarters at Manerplaw in January 1995.\n\nThere is a population of 2500 Karen in India, mostly restricted to Mayabunder Tehsil of North Andaman in Andaman and Nicobar union Territory of India. Almost all majority of them are Baptist Protestant Christians. They retain their language to intercommunicate within community, but use Hindi as a second language to communicate with non-Karen neighbours.\n\nThe Karen languages, members of the Tibeto-Burman group of the Sino-Tibetan language family, consist of three mutually unintelligible branches: Sgaw, Eastern Pwo, and Western Pwo.\nThe Karen languages are almost unique among the Tibeto-Burman languages in having a subject–verb–object word order; other than Karen and Bai, Tibeto-Burman languages feature a subject–object–verb order. This anomaly is likely due to the influence of neighboring Mon and Tai languages.\n\nThe majority of Karens are Theravada Buddhists who also practice animism, while approximately 15 percent are Christian. Lowland Pwo-speaking Karens tend to be more orthodox Buddhists, whereas highland Sgaw-speaking Karens tend to be heterodox Buddhists who profess strong animist beliefs.\n\nKaren animism is defined by a belief in ကလၤ \"k’lar\" (soul), thirty-seven spirits that embody every individual. Misfortune and sickness are believed to be caused by \"k’lar\" that wander away, and death occurs when all thirty-seven \"klar\" leave the body.\n\nKaren Buddhists are the most numerous of the Karens and account for around 65 percent of the total Karen population. The Buddhist influence came from the Mon who were dominant in Lower Burma until the middle of the 18th century. Buddhist Karen are found mainly in Karen State, Mon State, Yangon, Bago and Tanintharyi Region. There are Buddhist monasteries in most Karen villages, and the monastery is the centre of community life. Merit-making activities, such as alms giving, are central to Karen Buddhist life.\n\nBuddhism was brought to Pwo-speaking Karens in the late-1700s, and the Yedagon Monastery atop Mount Zwegabin became the leading center of Karen language Buddhist literature. Many millennial sects were founded throughout the 1800s, led by Karen Buddhist \"minlaung\" rebels. Two sects, Telakhon (or Telaku) and Leke, were founded in the 1860s. The Tekalu sect, founded in Kyaing and considered a Buddhist sect, is a mixture of spirit worship, Karen customs and worship of the future Buddha Metteyya. The Leke sect was founded on the western banks of the Thanlwin River, and is no longer associated with Buddhism (as followers do not venerate Buddhist monks). Followers believe that the future Buddha will return to Earth if they maintain their moral practices (following the Dhamma and precepts), and they practice vegetarianism, hold Saturday services and construct distinct pagodas. Several Buddhist socioreligious movements, both orthodox and heterodox, have arisen in the past century. \"Duwae\", a type of pagoda worship, with animistic origins, is also practiced.\n\nThere are several prominent Karen Buddhist monks, including Thuzana (S'gaw) and Zagara, who was conferred the \"Agga Maha Saddammajotika\" title by the Burmese government in 2004. The Karen of Thailand have their own religion.\n\nTha Byu, the first convert to Christianity in 1828, was baptised by Rev. George Boardman, an associate of Adoniram Judson, founder of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society. Today there are Christians belonging to the Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. Some of the largest Protestant denominations are Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists. \n\nAlongside \"orthodox\" Christianity, some of those who identify themselves as Christian also have syncretised elements of animism with Christianity. The Karen of the Irrawaddy delta are mostly Christians, whereas Buddhists tend to be found mainly in Kayin state and surrounding regions. An estimated 15-20 percent of Karen identify themselves as Christian today and about 90 percent of Karen people in the US are Christians.\n\nThe Karen Baptist Convention (KBC) was established in 1913. Its headquarters is in Yangon with 20 member associations throughout Myanmar. The KBC operates the KBC Charity Hospital in Insein, Yangon. The KBC also operates the Karen Baptist Theological Seminary in Insein. The seminary runs a theology program as well as a secular degree program (Liberal Arts Programme) to fulfill young Karens' intellectual and vocational needs. The Pwo Karen Baptist Convention is in Ahlone, Yangon and also operates the Pwo Karen Theological Seminary. There are other schools for Karen people in Myanmar, such as Paku Divinity School in Taungoo, Kothabyu Bible School in Pathein, and Yangon Home Mission School. The Thailand Karen Baptist Convention is in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventists have built several schools in the Karen refugee camps in Thailand to convert the Karen people. Eden Valley Academy in Tak and Karen Adventist Academy in Mae Hong Son are the two largest Seventh-day Adventist Karen schools.\n\nCrop rotation agriculture has been a part of Karen culture for at least several hundred years.\n\nKaren New Year is one of the major holidays that the Karen people celebrate. The date of Karen New Year day varies because the Karen people use the lunar calendar.\n\nKaren Wrist Tying is an important Karen holiday. This holiday observed in the month of August.\n\nA species of gecko, \"Hemidactylus karenorum\", is named in honor of the Karen people.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This vacuum was one of the first evacuated systems, predating the more well known Vacutainer. Its primary use was to test for syphilis and typhoid fever.\n\nEssentially, the Keidel vacuum consists of a sealed ampule with or without a culture medium. Connected to the ampule was a short rubber tube with a needle at the end, using a small glass tube as a cap. The insertion of the needle into the vein crushes the ampule, thus creating a vacuum and forcing blood into the container. Typically, a prominent vein in the forearm such as the median cubital vein would suffice, although the Keidel vacuum can take blood for any prominent peripheral vein. This concept did not become popular until during World War II, when quick and efficient first aid care was necessary in the battle field. As a result, the vacutainer became the forefront device used for blood collection.\n\n\n"}

There is no requirement for other nominated candidates to re-register, a new candidate may be nominated by the party of the deceased and any of the other candidates may at this point withdraw from the election, but independent candidates and candidates for other parties cannot be nominated.\n\nAccording to the Electoral Commission, if the deceased candidate was standing as an independent, the election continues as normal. The Speaker of the House of Commons seeking re-election is treated effectively as if he were standing for a party, except that in this case other candidates may be nominated by any party or as independents as the proceedings begin afresh.\n\nUnder all circumstances the deposit will be returned to the estate of the deceased candidate. In the unlikely event that a deceased independent candidate wins, the election is re-held with no new candidates and all deposits are returned.

{"id": "34833541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34833541", "title": "Non-material culture", "text": "Non-material culture\n\nCulture consists of both material culture and non-material culture. Thoughts or ideas that make up a culture are called the non-material culture. In contrast to material culture, non-material culture does not include any physical objects or artifacts. Examples of non-material culture include any ideas, beliefs, values, norms that may help shape society.\n\nLanguage and culture are closely tied together and can affect one another. One example of culture shaping language is the case of the Pirahã people. Their lack of words for numbers makes it impossible for them to have complex mathematical systems in their culture. This could be a result of their cultural requirements: because they have no need for extensive mathematics, there would be no need for them to form number words. The formation of American slang can also serve as a reflection of culture and has changed as American culture developed. For example, as people began speaking out in defense of homosexuality in the 1960s, vulgar language and slang became more acceptable to use and began to be included in dictionaries.\n\nThe theory based on the works of Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf holds that language actually limits and shapes how people see the world around them. This theory of linguistic relativity would indicate that language alters and restricts the formation of language.\n\nIn his 1973 book, \"The Interpretation of Cultures\", anthropologist Clifford Geertz refers to culture as \"a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes toward life,\" expressing the importance he placed on symbols in culture. Just like language, symbols form as a culture grows. People in a particular society attribute meaning to specific objects, and that imbued meaning transforms that object into a widely recognized symbol in that society. There can be symbols that cross cultural boundaries. For example, a cross is a universal symbol of Christianity, and is so universally known due to the prevalence of Christianity in different cultures. Though the first stop sign first appeared in Michigan in the United States, the physical attributes are so well known in many different cultures due to its use in so many different countries. Some symbols meaning only to a particular cultures. In American culture, a white picket fence is a widely recognized symbol for a successful and happy suburban life.\n\nThe culture that an individual is part of influences several aspects of that individual, including behavior. Through socialization, an individual will learn the values and norms inherent in their society and, in most cases, will behave according to those values and norms. Behavior is important because it can convey the values of a society. For example, in Japanese culture, which depends on the \"fundamental relatedness of individuals\" it is important to fit in with those around you and maintain harmonious personal relationships. Individuals in Japanese culture behave to avoid exclusion from society, putting flexibility, empathy, and self-restraint above expression of personal thoughts and opinions. \n\nBehavior can also influence a culture. This can be seen in the caste system in India. In higher caste levels, it is customary for an individual to follow Sanskritic customs. Those in the lower caste levels take on this behavior in order to move up in the caste system. This type of behavior has had an influence on Indian culture: the numerous lower caste individuals participating in Sanskritic customs helped spread those customs all throughout India.\n\n"}

It is believed that ancestors watch over their progeny to stop them from doing mischief. For instance, an Ogugu man can not be a party to premeditated murder. He would be 'arrested' by Ibegwu. He would be struck by some mysterious ailment, the cure to which is a public confession and performance of the necessary rituals for cleansing.

Some have argued that if a man has the liberty to flirt, a woman should also have the same right. They are predominantly subsistence farmers.\nIbegwu culture is all encompassing to a woman.

The earliest written account of pre-Imperial Mali was in the 9th century by Ahmad al-Yaqubi in his Kitab al-Buldan. In al-Bakri's reference of the Western Sudan written in 1068, he names two countries \"Daw\" and \"Malal\" located near the Niger and close to gold-fields, which are likely to be the core of the eventual Empire of Mali. Al-Bakri goes on to describe how the unnamed ruler of the kingdom was converted to Islam by a merchant when he witnessed the miraculous shower of rain that ended a drought. This event occurred at least one generation preceding 1068, since al-Bakri noted that the ruler's descendants and his nobles kept Islam, even though the common people were not converted. Ibn Khaldun, a North African historian living in Egypt interviewed shaykh Uthman, who was the faqih of Ghana and described as wide and learned. Uthman provided information on the past kings, presumably from oral tradition current in his day (1394), and named the first Muslim king Barmandana. In al-Idrisi's account of 1154, he noted that the two towns of Daw and Malal had four days' travel between them, located in a river valley that joins the Nile (by which he meant the Niger). Malal was described as a \"small town, like a large village without a surrounding wall, built on an unassailable hill of red earth.\"\n\nIn 1965 and beyond a Polish archaeological team excavated at Niani, reputed to be the ancient capital of Mali. They discovered remains of buildings and other artefacts that showed a fairly intensive occupation of the site since the sixth century CE, though the site could not be classified as urban until much later, perhaps the fourteenth century. At its height, Niani comprised a number of densely occupied clusters scattered over the countryside, including a remarkable number of iron-producing sites, pointing to the town as a major industrial centre. There are also evidences of an Islamic presence, supporting the idea that there was a Muslim or commercial town and a royal town, as well as other sites. These excavations provided the strongest support for the traditional claim that a state of some complexity pre-existed the imperial period in Mali's history.\n\nSome of what historians have written about pre-Imperial Mali is based on oral tradition collected since the late nineteenth century. Much of the tradition focuses on the \"Epic of Sunjata\" a series of tales about early Mali that griots assemble into longer versions. There are several of these versions in print, the most famous of which is that of D. T. Niane, thanks to its lively narrative style and early translation into other languages. Niane's work, however, is not a literal translation of an original oral discourse, though it is surely largely based on tales told by a certain Mamadou Kouyate of Keyla. Rather, it is a reworking in literary form of Kouyate's tales. More literal versions of the tradition have since been published in French, English and Mandinka versions.\n\nAccording to these traditions, the Mandinka kingdoms of Mali or Manden had already existed several centuries before Sundiata’s unification as a small state just to the south of the Soninké empire of Wagadou, better known as the Ghana Empire. This area was composed of mountains, savannah and forest providing ideal protection and resources for the population of hunters. Those not living in the mountains formed small city-states such as Toron, Ka-Ba and Niani. The Keita dynasty from which nearly every Mali emperor came traces its lineage back to Bilal, the faithful muezzin of Islam’s prophet Muhammad. Another detailed episode was told that instead of one there is three Bilal sons that departing to Manden and founding the country of Manden there, where the eldest became the first ruler\n\nIt was common practice during the Middle Ages for both Christian and Muslim rulers to tie their bloodline back to a pivotal figure in their faith’s history. Oral chroniclers have preserved a list of each Keita ruler from Lawalo (one of Bilal’s seven sons whom settled in Mali) to Maghan Kon Fatta (father of Sundiata Keita).\n\nThe French colonial administrator and historian Maurice Delafosse was one of the earliest Western historians to attempt a comprehensive history of the region in his book \"Haut-Sénégal-Niger\" (1912) produced a fairly detailed and exact chronology of Mali. However, he never explained how he arrived at the dates he presented there, or elsewhere, and indeed, the primary sources on which he relied did not give clear indications of chronology at that level of detail. Scholars since then, while occasionally noting the issue, have accepted this chronology and it is thus widely reported and repeated. There is little question that it is approximately correct, since the Arabic materials are fairly abundant and give a number of clues, but it would be wrong to repeat this chronology as being confirmed by original material.\n\nAccording to modern traditions, during the height of Ghana's power, the land of Manden became one of its provinces, though the contemporary evidence of al-Bakri does not support such a large extent for Ghana's rule. According to traditions, the Manden city-state of Ka-ba (present-day Kangaba) served as the capital and name of this province. From at least the beginning of the 11th century, Mandinka kings probably known as faamas ruled Manden from Ka-ba \n\nModern oral traditions maintain that after the fall of Ghana the Kangaba province, splintered into twelve kingdoms with their own maghan (meaning prince) or faama. Manden was split in half with the Dodougou territory to the northeast and the Kri territory to the southwest. The tiny kingdom of Niani was one of several in the Kri area of Manden. Archaeological work places Niani, which later writers named as the capital of the country, in this region.\n\nAccording to traditions current in the fourteenth century and reported to the historian ibn Khaldun by the faqih of Ghana, shaykh Uthman in 1394, the Almoravid movement weakened Ghana, to the extent that \"the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away, and they were overcome by the Susu, a neighboring people of the Sudan, who subjugated and absorbed them.\" Traditions in Mali related that the Soso attacked and took over Mali as well, and the ruler of the Soso, Sumaouro Kanté took over the land.\n\nThe tradition of the final emergence of Mali as an imperial power was also first revealed by shaykh Uthman, when he told ibn Khaldun that Mali emerged following its defeat of the Soso. \"Their greatest king, he who overcame the Susu, conquered their country and seized their power from their hands, was named Mari Jata.\" The story of the rise of Sundiata (or Sunjata), as he is known modern tradition is still the most widely recited tradition among Mandinka speaking people, a group of stories concerning his reign known as the Epic of Sundiata. While there are many versions of the story, most agree that he was the son of Niani’s faama, Nare Fa (also known as Maghan Kon Fatta meaning the handsome prince). Sundiata’s mother was Maghan Kon Fatta’s second wife, Sogolon Kédjou. She was a hunchback from the land of Do, south of Mali. The child of this marriage received the first name of his mother (Sogolon) and the surname of his father (Djata). Combined in the rapidly spoken language of the Mandinka, the names formed Sondjata or Sundjata. The anglicized version of this name, Sundiata, is also popular. According to shaykh Uthman in 1394 as reported by ibn Khaldun, the name was \"Mari, which in their language means 'prince of the royal line' and Jata, which means 'lion.'\" \n\nSundiata was prophesied to become a great conqueror. To his parent's dread, the prince did not have a promising start. Sundiata, according to the oral traditions, did not walk until he was seven years old. However, once Sundiata did gain use of his legs he grew strong and very respected. Sadly for Sundiata, this did not occur before his father died. Despite the faama of Niani’s wishes to respect the prophecy and put Sundiata on the throne, the son from his first wife Sassouma Bérété was crowned instead. As soon as Sassouma’s son Dankaran Touman took the throne, he and his mother forced the increasingly popular Sundiata into exile along with his mother and two sisters. Before Dankaran Touman and his mother could enjoy their unimpeded power, King Soumaoro set his sights on Niani forcing Dankaran to flee to Kissidougou.\n\nAfter many years in exile, first at the court of Wagadou and then at Mema, Sundiata was sought out by a Niani delegation and begged to combat the Sosso and free the kingdoms of Manden forever.\n\nReturning with the combined armies of Mema, Wagadou and all the rebellious Mandinka city-states, Sundiata led a revolt against the Kaniaga Kingdom around 1234. The combined forces of northern and southern Manden defeated the Sosso army at the Battle of Kirina (then known as \"Krina\") in approximately 1235. This victory resulted in the fall of the Kaniaga kingdom and the rise of the Mali Empire. After the victory, King Soumaoro disappeared, and the Mandinka stormed the last of the Sosso cities. Maghan Sundiata was declared “faama of faamas” and received the title “mansa”, which translates roughly to emperor. At the age of 18, he gained authority over all the twelve kingdoms in an alliance known as the Manden Kurufa. He was crowned under the throne name Mari Djata becoming the first Mandinka emperor.\n\nThe Mali Empire was the second in a wave of successive states forged in the Sahel characterized by stronger and stronger centralization. Whereas the Ghana Empire had very little centralization outside of the edicts of its emperor, the Mali Empire would emerge as West Africa’s first federalized state with sweeping laws that were more or less uniform over an area roughly the size of Western Europe. This trend of centralization would be adopted and further developed by the Songhai during Mali’s decline as well as Bamana, Wolof and Fula states thereafter.\n\nThe Manden Kurufa founded by Mari Djata I was composed of the “three freely allied states” of Mali, Mema and Wagadou plus the Twelve Doors of Mali. It is important to remember that Mali, in this sense, strictly refers to the city-state of Niani.\n\nMema was a powerful city-state near the bend of the Niger River outside of Manden. It was allied to Sundiata throughout his campaign against Kaniaga. Its faama (sometimes referred to as a mansa in oral traditions) was allowed to keep his crown and not prostrate before Sundiata, because of the latter’s exile at that court. \n\nWagadou, another land outside of Manden, was also allowed to keep its monarch. The Ghana (\"warrior-king\") of Wagadou received the same benefits as Mema and for the same reasons.\n\nThe twelve doors of Mali were a coalition of conquered or allied territories, mostly within Manden, with sworn allegiance to Sundiata and his descendants. Upon stabbing their spears into the ground before Sundiata’s throne, each of the twelve kings relinquished their kingdom to the Keita dynasty. In return for their submission, they became “farbas” a combination of the Mandinka words “farin” and “ba\" (great farin). Farin was a general term for northern commander at the time. These farbas would rule their old kingdoms in the name of the mansa with most of the authority they held prior to joining the Manden Kurufa.\n\nImmediately after being crowned mansa, Mari Djata instituted a universal constitution for all subjects of his new state called the Kouroukan Fouga. At a site just outside the town of Kangaba, he formalised the government and established the Gbara or Great Assembly.\n\nThe Gbara or Great Assembly would serve as the Mandinka deliberative body until the collapse of the Manden Kurufa in 1645. Its first meeting, at the famous Kouroukan Fouga (Division of the World), had 29 clan delegates presided over by a belen-tigui (master of ceremony). The final incarnation of the Gbara, according to the surviving traditions of northern Guinea, held 32 positions occupied by 28 clans.\n\nThe Kouroukan Fouga also put in place social and economic reforms including prohibitions on the maltreatment of prisoners and slaves, installing women in government circles and placing a system of banter between clans which clearly stated who could say what about in who. Also, Sundiata divided the lands amongst the people assuring everyone had a place in the empire and fixed exchange rates for common products. \n\nAnother crucial fact established at the \"Kouroukan Fouga\" was the supremacy of Manden over all realms controlled by or allied to the federation including Wagadou and Mema. All future mansas would have to be chosen from the Keita clan, and the city-state of Niani (in present-day Guinea) would become the federal capital. Mansa Mari Djata returned to and rebuilt the capital of Niani, which had been destroyed by Soumaoro in his absence, and made it the most important center of trade in West Africa for the next 200 years.\n\nMansa Mari Djata’s reign saw the conquest and or annexation of several key locals in the Mali Empire. When the campaigning was done, his empire extended 1,000 miles east to west with those borders being the bends of the Senegal and Niger Rivers respectively. After unifying Manden, he added the Wangara goldfields making them the southern border. The northern commercial towns of Oualata and Audaghost were also conquered and became part of the new state’s northern border. Wagadou and Mema became junior partners in the realm and part of the imperial nucleus. The lands of Bambougou, Jalo (Fouta Djallon), and Kaabu were added into Mali by Fakoli Koroma, Fran Kamara, and Tiramakhan Traore, respectively. \n\nWhen Mari Djata I dies, as the result of either drowning in the Sankarani river or an errant arrow in a celebration, he had a standing army and control over the coveted trans-Saharan trade routes.\n"}

The Phillimore Edition is synoptic, placing its translation alongside a facsimile of Farley's edition, and is published in a separate volume for each county.\nThe Phillimore translation did not, however supersede the VCH one as the most authoritative.\n\nThe Alecto Editions are a series of high-quality bibliophile facsimiles published 1985–1992, with a new English translation in two separate volumes. The Alecto editorial board produced a corrected and standardized translation based on the VCH text. Penguin Books reprinted the Alecto Editions translation in a single volume published in hardback in 2002 and in paperback in 2003.\n\nA digital edition of manuscript facsimile images alongside the text of the Phillimore translation was published as the \"Domesday Explorer\" on CD-ROM in 2000, publicly accessible as an online database since 2008.\n\nDomesday Book was an item of great interest to the antiquarian movement of the 18th century. This was the age of the county history, with many accounts of the English shires being published at this time, and Domesday Book, as a property record of early date that happened to be arranged by county, was a major source for the medieval history of all the counties encompassed by the survey.\n\nThe reconstituted Society of Antiquaries of London, founded in 1717 by Humfrey Wanley, John Bagford and John Talman, made it part of its mission to work towards the publication of a wide variety of ancient records, including Domesday. The Society struggled to achieve its aims, however, being afflicted by its members' limited resources and sheer lack of enthusiasm.,\n\nNevertheless, after the purchase of a Royal Charter in 1751, the possibility of publishing Domesday became more realistic. In 1756 Philip Carteret Webb read a paper to the Society emphasising the great value of Domesday Book, and by implication the urgent need for a published edition: this paper was printed by the printing press of William Bowyer. The following year, in response to Webb's request, members reported back to the Society regarding existing printed and MS transcripts from Domesday Book, with the intention of compiling material that might be of assistance in the task of compiling an edition. This effort did not bear fruit.\n\nIn 1767, however, for reasons that may be connected to this renewal of interest in Domesday Book, plans were set in motion for the publication of a complete, scholarly edition of Domesday: this coincided with a programme of publication of other public records, including the Parliament Rolls.\n\nIn March 1767 Charles Morton (1716–1799), a librarian at the British Museum, was put in charge of the scheme; a fact which caused resentment towards him from Abraham Farley, a deputy chamberlain of the Exchequer who for many years had controlled access to Domesday Book in its repository at the Chapter House, Westminster, and furthermore had been involved in the recent Parliament Rolls printing operation. In 1768 Farley complained to the Treasury that he, not Morton, should be in charge of the project, while Morton, for his part, complained that he was being obstructed in his work by the staff at the Chapter House.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, had become concerned at the spiralling cost estimates – Morton indicated in 1770 that to continue would cost £4,525 on top of the £2,810 he had already spent. At this point, Farley was remembered, and he became co-editor of the work. Farley and Morton's rivalry precluded an enduring, constructive relationship, and after 1774 Farley was effectively in sole charge.\n\nFarley pursued the task with a single-minded devotion born of long involvement with the public records, and Domesday Book in particular. One of his closest associates during the project was the printer John Nichols, inheritor of William Bowyer's London printing press, who in 1773 had developed the special \"record type\" typeface that was used in the published edition to represent as closely as possible the script in Domesday Book itself. Ultimately, Farley's edition of Domesday was completed by 15 March 1783.\n\nAlthough of a high standard, Farley's work lacked supplementary material and indices. In 1800, therefore, the Record Commission ordered the printing of indexes to Farley's work. These were compiled under the direction of Sir Henry Ellis and published in 1816, together with an edition of four \"satellite surveys\" – the Exon Domesday, the \"Liber Winton\", the \"Inquisito Eliensis\" and the Boldon Book.\n\nThe circulation of Farley's edition was so limited that it could not be truly accounted a work that significantly increased public access to Domesday Book. That was to take place only in 1861, with the production of the first photozincographic facsimile edition of Domesday.\n\nThe driving force behind the project was Colonel Henry James, the Director General at the Ordnance Survey. The process involved the transferring of a photograph onto zinc or stone, which could then be used directly for printing or, alternatively, onto the waxed surface of a copper plate where the image formed a guide for engraving. It was a system that enabled facsimile reproduction en masse and thus, following a meeting with William Ewart Gladstone in 1859, in which James was allegedly asked by the then-Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether he \"knew of any process by which some of our ancient manuscripts in the Record Office could be copied\", James emphasised the superiority of this process over other reproductions, such as lithography, which used heavy and brittle stone blocks and claimed that the process would be ideal for making cheap facsimile copies of Domesday Book.\n\nIn a letter to the assistant Secretary to the Treasury, George Hamilton in October 1860, James outlined the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book as an estimated £1575 for 500 copies or, alternatively, £3. 3s. per copy. James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimating the cost of 500 copies to be £11. 2s. 4d. On 14 January 1861, James was granted permission to photo-zincograph the Cornwall fragment of Domesday Book as a Treasury-funded experiment to determine the success of the process and, consequently, by 1863 the Ordnance Survey had photozincographed Domesday Book in its entirety, publishing it in 32 county volumes. Two colours (red and black) were used, replicating those used in the original manuscript.\n\nThe general public were excited about the invention of photozincography. Newspapers such as the \"Photographic News\" reported on the events surrounding the invention and even supplied their readers with an example of a document which had undergone the process.\n\nThe \"Victoria County History\" (VCH) was founded in 1899 as a project to publish an encyclopaedic history of each of the historic counties of England to a uniform plan. From the outset, it was intended that this plan should include English translations of the relevant county sections of the Domesday Book, with a scholarly introduction and a map. \n\nJ. H. Round was appointed editor for the Domesday sections. He translated the texts and wrote the introductions for Hampshire (published 1900), Worcestershire (1901), Northamptonshire (1902), and Essex (1903); wrote the introductions for Hertfordshire (1902), Surrey (1902), Bedfordshire (1904), Warwickshire (1904), Buckinghamshire (1905), Somerset (1906), Berkshire (1907), and Herefordshire (1908), though the translations were by others; and he oversaw work on Cumberland (by J. Wilson, published 1901), Derbyshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1905), Sussex (by L. F. Salzman, published 1905), Devon (by O. J. Reichel, published 1906), Lancashire (by William Farrer, published 1906), Norfolk (by Charles Johnson, published 1906), Nottinghamshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1906), Leicestershire (by Frank Stenton, published 1907), Rutland (by Frank Stenton, published 1908), and Shropshire (translation by C. H. Drinkwater, introduction by James Tait, published 1908). Round also began a translation of Domesday for Lincolnshire, but this remained unfinished.\n\nRound retired from the project in 1908, but the VCH subsequently published translations of Domesday for Suffolk (translation anonymous, introduction by B.A. Lees, published 1911); Yorkshire (by William Farrer, published 1912); Cornwall (translation by T. Taylor, introduction by L. F. Salzman, published 1924); Huntingdonshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1926); Kent (translation by F. W. Ragg, introduction by N. Neilson, published 1932); Cambridgeshire (translation by J. Otway-Ruthven, introduction by L. F. Salzman, published 1938); Oxfordshire (by Frank Stenton, published 1939); Wiltshire (by R. R. Darlington, published 1955); Staffordshire (by C. F. Slade, published 1958); Dorset (translation by A. Williams, introduction by Ralph Pugh, published 1968); and Middlesex (by T. G. Pinder, published 1969).\n\nIndependently of the VCH, translations were published for Cheshire by James Tait for the Chetham Society in 1916; for Lincolnshire by C.W. Foster and T. Longley for the Lincoln Record Society in 1924 (reprinted 1976); for the East Riding of Yorkshire by A.B. Wilson-Barkworth in 1925; and for Staffordshire by H.M. Fraser in 1936.\nThis left only Gloucestershire without a published 20th-century translation.\n\nThe Phillimore Edition is a parallel-text Latin and English edition of Great Domesday Book, published in the 1970s by the local-history specialist publishers Phillimore & Co under the general editorship of John Morris. Each county occupies a separate volume. \n\nThe Latin text, printed on the left-hand pages, is a facsimile of Farley's edition; the translation, on the right-hand pages, was prepared by a team of volunteers, who (to ensure uniformity) worked within standardised guidelines for syntax, punctuation and the rendering of proper names and technical terms. Each volume includes notes, tables of tenants' names and place-names, and a map. \n\nUniform with the edition, a one-volume \"Guide\" to Domesday Book by Rex Welldon Finn was published in 1973. \n\nAlthough the Phillimore edition rapidly became the most readily accessible and widely used version of Domesday Book, scholars criticised the translation for over-simplifying complex historical concepts: David Bates, for example, described it as \"unconvincingly and unhelpfully 'modern'\".\n\nPublished between 1985 and 1992, the Alecto Edition is the most complete facsimile of Domesday Book to date. There are three types of Alecto edition, the \"Penny Edition\", the Millennium Edition and the Domesday Book Studies edition. It has been called an \"indecently exact facsimile\" by Professor Geoffrey Martin, then Keeper of Public Records and custodian of the original Domesday. \n\nThis edition was accompanied by a volume of indices, a two-volume English translation and a box set of Ordnance Survey Maps with the Domesday sites overlaid on the modern maps. \n\nIn order to produce this extremely high quality reproduction, the original Domesday Book was unbound to allow each page to be photographed. The camera used for this process was the same size as a Ford Fiesta, and for security reasons was only operated in a sealed cage.\n\nThe Penny Edition was printed on a specialist paper made from cotton from the American Deep South to give something of the same weight and feel as the parchment of the original. These pages were then bound between sheets of 15th-century oak set with a silver penny of William I and another 1986 Elizabeth II penny minted specially for the occasion. Because of the vast expense involved each copy of the Penny Edition cost £5750 and only 250 were produced. The later Millennium Edition used the same high quality images and paper was bound into two volumes of calfskin in the style of the 12th-century binding. This edition was limited to 450 copies at a cost of £6750 for Greater Domesday and £5750 for Little Domesday.\n\nThe Library Version of Domesday used the same paper as the Penny and Millennium versions but was bound in a linen cover and boxed to provide durability. This edition came with indices, translations and maps.\n\nThe Alecto Historical Editions translation, published in two companion volumes to the facsimile, was intended to supersede the VCH translation, which, although of high quality, suffers from inconsistencies due to its publication history being spread out over more than 80 years. The editorial board, consisting of Ann Williams (editor-in-chief), G. H. Martin (general editor), J. C. Holt, Henry R. Loyn, Elizabeth Hallam-Smith (Assistant Keeper of Public Records), and Sarah Tyacke (Keeper of Public Records, the National Archives) produced a rigorously standardized and corrected translation based on the VCH text. \n\nPenguin Books reproduced the Alecto translation in a single volume, published in 2002 in hardback and in 2003 in paperback, with an introduction by G. H. Martin. It is the first edition to omit the Latin text entirely, and the first single-volume edition of the translated text. The paperback was originally priced at £25.\n\n\nThe Domesday Explorer was developed by John Palmer of University of Hull and his son Matthew Palmer as a private project beginning 1986 and using Microsoft Access, later turned into a publicly funded project, receiving a grant of £250,000 from the British Arts and Humanities Research Council. It was published on CD-ROM in 2000, and eventually made publicly accessible online \nby the University of Essex in 2008.\nThe database includes high-resolution manuscript images, the text of the Phillimore translation (ed. John Morris), geographic information for interactive mapping of searches, stock charts of all reported livestock and statistics reports on each county of the survey. These were produced by Palmer using the work of previous Domesday experts such as Ellis, Maitland and Finn. \n\nThere are two main suppliers of commercial copies of Domesday, \n\n"}
{"id": "15941865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15941865", "title": "Qingjing Jing", "text": "Qingjing Jing\n\nThe Qingjing Jing () is an anonymous Tang Dynasty Daoist classic that combines philosophical themes from the \"Dao De Jing\" with the logical presentation of Buddhist texts and a literary form reminiscent of the \"Heart Sutra\". It instructs students of the Dao to practice the elimination of desire in order to cultivate spiritual purity and stillness.\n\nThe \"Qingjing jing\" title combines \"qing\" \"pure; clean; clear; fresh; cool; distinct; clarified; quiet; peaceful\", \"jing\" \"still; motionless; static; silent; quiet; peaceful; calm; tranquil\", and \"jing\" \"(fabric) warp; scripture; canon; classic\".\n\nThe first Chinese character \"qing\" 淸 has the \"water\" radical 氵 and a \"qing\" 青 \"green\" phonetic element. The second character \"jing\" 靜 has the \"green\" radical 青 and a \"zheng\" 爭 \"struggle\" phonetic, and was anciently a variant Chinese character for \"jing\" \"clean; pure; complete; only\", which has the \"water\" radical and this \"zheng\" phonetic. \"Qingjing\" could interchangeably be written 清靜 or 清淨, for instance, the Daoist concept \"qingjing wuwei\" 清靜無為 or 清凈無為 \"quiet and non-action; discard all desires and worries from one's mind\". Chinese Buddhism used \"qingjing\" 清淨 to translate Sanskrit \"parishuddhi\" or Pali \"vishuddhi\" \"complete purification; free from defilement\" (cf. \"vishudda\"). Kunio Miura explains,\nWhereas Chinese Buddhism always used the compound \"qingjing\" 清淨 (clarity and purity) rather than \"qingjing\" 清靜 (clarity and quiescence), Taoism uses both interchangeably. When \"qingjing\" 清淨 (clarity and purity) is used, however, there is ample room for considering a Buddhist influence. (2007:800)\nIn Standard Chinese usage, \"qingjing\" 清靜 means \"quiet; tranquil; serene (surroundings, etc.)\" and \"qingjing\" 清淨 means \"tranquil; clean and pure; (Buddhism) purified of defiling illusion, not bothered by material concerns\".\n\nEnglish translations of the \"Qingjing jing\" title include:\n\nThe \"Qingjing Jing\" is a short, mostly-versified text comprising some 390 Chinese characters in 90 verses. It is widely read, has numerous commentaries, and is considered one of the most important texts in the Daoist religion.\n\nTwo passages of the \"Qingjing Jing\" are attributed to Laozi, with the honorific \"Lord Lao\" (老君, see Three Pure Ones). This has led many traditional sources to attribute authorship of the entire text to Laozi, so the text exists under a variety of honorific titles that link it to him. Scholars believe the received text dates from around the middle Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE).\n\nThe oldest extant commentary is by Du Guangting (杜光庭, 850-933 CE), a prolific editor of Daoist texts during the late Tang and Five Dynasties period. Du says prior to being written down by Ge Xuan (164-244 CE), the \"Qingjing Jing\" was orally transmitted for generations, supposedly going back to the mythical Queen Mother of the West.\n\nThe \"Daozang\" \"Daoist Canon\" includes eight \"Qingjing jing\" editions with variant titles. The basic text (CT 620) is the \"Qingjing miaojing\" (清靜妙經 \"Wondrous Scripture of Clarity and Stillness\") or \"Taishang Laojun shuo chang qingjing miaojing\" (太上老君說常清靜妙經 \"Wondrous Scripture of Constant Clarity and Stillness, as Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao\"). Commentaries include those entitled \"Qingjing jingzhu\" (清靜經注, CT 755-760) and \"Qingjing jing songzhu\" (清靜經頌注, CT 974).\n\nA slightly longer (and \"possibly earlier\", Kohn 2007:800) version of approximately 600 characters is the \"Qingjing xinjing\" (清靜心經 \"Heart Scripture of Clarity and Stillness\") or \"Taishang Laojun qingjing xinjing\" (太上老君清靜心經 \"Heart Scripture of Clarity and Stillness, as Spoken by the Most High Lord Lao\", CT 1169).\n\nDuring the Song Dynasty (960-1260 CE), the \"Qingjing Jing\" became popular within the Southern Lineage \"Complete Perfection\" or Quanzhen School and was interpreted in context with \"neidan\" Chinese internal alchemy. For instance, the seventh Quanzhen master Sun Bu'er 孙不二 took Qingjing sanren 清靜散人 \"Vagabond of Clarity and Quiescence\" as her sobriquet and established the Qingjing Sect (Miura 2007:800). Modern Quanzhen Daoists consider the \"Qingjing jing\" a central scripture and regularly chant it in \"songjing\" (誦經, \"reciting scriptural passages; ritual recitation\"). Kohn explains.\nThe text serves to inspire the active practitioner and believer. It provides an easy handle on the realization of the Tao within the religious life. It is an exhortation to purity and meditation, a warning against bad thoughts and deviant desires. Pious Taoists know this short and rhythmic text by heart. (1993:25) \n\nAlthough brief, the \"Qingjing Jing\" is philosophically complex. It synthesizes Daoist and Buddhist theories of psychology, cosmology, ontology, and teleology.\n\nThe \"Qingjing Jing\" is described by Komjathy.\nAn anonymous text probably dating from the 9th century, this is one of a group of Tang-dynasty (618-907) works that could be labeled \"Clarity-and-Stillness\" literature. Emerging under the influence of Buddhist insight meditation (\"vipaśyanā\") and expressing a form of wisdom (\"zhi\" 智) based on the practice of observation (\"guan\" 觀), the text combines the worldview of the \"Daode jing\" 道德經 (Scripture on the Dao and Inner Power) with the practice of Daoist observation and the structure (as well as some content) of the Buddhist \"Panruo xinjing\" 般若心經 (Heart Sutra of Perfect Wisdom; T. 250-57). It emphasizes the dual cultivation of clarity/purity (\"qing\" 清) and \"stillness/tranquility\" (\"jing\" 靜). (2004:47-8) \nThese Daoist keywords are \"guan\" \"scrutiny; careful observation; insight meditation; contemplation\", \"qing\" \"clarity; purity; cleanliness\", and \"jing\" \"stillness; quiet; calm; tranquility\". The \"Daodejing\" (45, tr. Mair 1990:13) is the locus classicus for \"qingjing\": \"Bustling about vanquishes cold, Standing still vanquishes heat. Pure and still, one can put things right everywhere under heaven.\"\n\nKohn summarizes the \"Qingjing jing\".\nThe text first describes the nature of the Dao as divided into Yin and Yang, clear and turbid (\"qing\" 清 and \"zhuo\" 濁), moving and quiescent (\"dong\" 動 and \"jing\" 靜), and stresses the importance of the mind in the creation of desires and worldly entanglements. It recommends the practice of observation to counteract this, i.e., the observation of other beings, the self, and the mind, which results in the realization that none of these really exists. The practitioner has reached the observation of emptiness (\"kongguan\" 空觀). The latter part of the work reverses direction and outlines the decline from pure spirit to falling into hell: spirit (\"shen\" 神) develops consciousness or mind (\"xin\" 心), and mind develops greed and attachment toward the myriad beings. Greed then leads to involvement, illusory imagining, and erroneous ways, which trap beings in the chain of rebirth, and they sink deeper into the quagmire of desire, causes them to fall into hell. (2007:801) \n\nThe \"Qingjing jing\" has been translated into English by Balfour (1894:70-73), Legge (1891 2:247-54), and Kohn (1993:24-29). Wong(1992) translated the Shuijingzi (水精子) commentary.\n\nThe following versions of the opening section (verses 1-8 and 9-13, reformatted for consistency) illustrate the translational range. \nLâo the Master said, The Great Tâo has no bodily form, but It produced and nourishes heaven and earth. The Great Tâo has no passions, but It causes the sun and moon to revolve as they do. The Great Tâo has no name, but It effects the growth and maintenance of all things. I do not know its name, but I make an effort, and call It the Tâo. <br>\nNow, the Tâo (shows itself in two forms); the Pure and the Turbid, and has (the two conditions of) Motion and Rest. Heaven is pure and earth is turbid; heaven moves and earth is at rest. The masculine is pure and the feminine is turbid; the masculine moves and the feminine is still. The radical (Purity) descended, and the (turbid) issue flowed abroad; and thus all things were produced. The pure is the source of the turbid, and motion is the foundation of rest. If man could always be pure and still, heaven and earth would both revert (to non-existence). (tr. Legge 1891:249-250) \nThe Great Tao has no form; It brings forth and raises heaven and earth. The Great Tao has no feelings; It regulates the course of the sun and the moon. The Great Tao has no name; It raises and nourishes the myriad beings. I do not know its name – So I call it Tao. <br> \nThe Tao can be pure or turbid; moving or tranquil. Heaven is pure, earth is turbid; Heaven is moving, earth is tranquil. The male is moving, the female is tranquil. Descending from the origin, Flowing toward the end, The myriad beings are being born. Purity – the source of turbidity, Movement – the root of tranquility. Always be pure and tranquil; Heaven and earth Return to the primordial. (tr. Kohn 1993:25) \n\n\n"}

In the recent years, scores of Burmese women seeking employment have entered the country. Different resources cite the number of these women to be in the thousands.\n\nAccording to community leaders and social scientists, there are over 1.6 million Bengalis and up to 400,000 Rohingyas living in Karachi. There are numerous Burmese housing colonies that can be found throughout Karachi. Traditionally, cultural similarities of the Rohingya people to those of Bengalis has enabled easier communication and interaction of the Burmese in Karachi with the Bengali community. Their native Rohingya language furthermore has dialect familiarities especially with the Bangladeshi natives hailing from Chittagong, who speak a somewhat indistinct Chittagonian language. As a result of the great inter-ethnic engagement, the Burmese people in Pakistan have a special reputation for being found in areas only that traditionally also contain a Bengali population. With more stringent control and difficulty in traversing borders the Burmese have now started travelling east to countries closer to Burma such as Thailand, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Malaysia.

It was situated on the eastern bank of Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico, to the northeast of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. The site of pre-Columbian Texcoco is now subsumed by the modern Mexican \"municipio\" of Texcoco and its major settlement, the city formally known as Texcoco de Mora. It also lies within the greater metropolitan area of Mexico City.\n\nPre-Columbian Texcoco is most noted for its membership in the Aztec Triple Alliance. At the time of the Spanish conquest of Mexico, it was one of the largest and most prestigious cities in central Mexico, second only to the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. A survey of Mesoamerican cities estimated that pre-conquest Texcoco had a population of 24,000 and occupied an area of 450 hectares.\n\nThe people of \"Tetzcohco\" were called \"Tetzcocatl\" (singular) or \"Tetzcocah\" (plural).\n\nTexcoco was founded in the 12th century, on the eastern shore of Lake Texcoco, probably by the Chichimecs. In or about 1337, the Acolhua, with Tepanec help, expelled Chichimecs from Texcoco and Texcoco became the Acolhua capital city, taking over that role from Coatlinchan.\n\nIn 1418, Ixtlilxochitl I, the \"tlatoani\" (ruler) of Texcoco, was dethroned by Tezozomoc of Azcapotzalco. Ten years later, in 1428, Ixtlilxochitl's son, Nezahualcoyotl allied with the Mexica to defeat Tezozomoc's son and successor, Maxtla. Texcoco and the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan, with the Tepanecs of Tlacopan, subsequently formalized their association as the Triple Alliance. However this was an uneven alliance as Tlacopan entered the battle against Azcapotzalco late. Texcoco thereby became the second-most important city in the eventual Aztec empire, by agreement receiving two-fifths of the tribute collected while Tlacopan received one-fifth.\n\nTexcoco was known as a center of learning within the empire, and had a famed library including books from older Mesoamerican civilizations.\n\nErected by the hill of Texcotzingo, the royal residence had aqueducts, baths, gardens, stairways and over 300 separate chambers.\n\nThe palace gardens were a vast botanical collection that included plants from not only the growing Aztec Empire but also the most remote corners of Mesoamerica. Remnants of the gardens still exist to this day and have recently been studied by a team of Discovery Channel scientists, who were able to demonstrate by means of modeling and computer simulation that the layout of the site had been carefully planned to be in alignment with astronomical events, with an emphasis on Venus, and not simply aligned with the cardinal directions as previously assumed.\n\nThe water used to irrigate the gardens was obtained from the springs beyond the mountains to the east of Texcoco. The water was channeled through canals carved into the rock. In certain areas, rock staircases were used as waterfalls. After clearing the mountains, the canals continued downhill to a point a short distance from Texcotzingo. There the path to the city was blocked a deep canyon that ran from north to south. Nezahualcoyotl ordered that the gap be filled with tons of rocks and stones, thus creating one of the earliest major aqueducts in the New World.\nThe whole hill of Texcotzingo was also served by this canal system and converted by his designers into a sacred place for the rain god Tláloc, complete with waterfalls, exotic animals and birds.\n\nOn the summit of the mountain he constructed a shrine to the god, laid out in hanging gardens reached by an airy flight of five hundred and twenty marble steps, a significant number, since according to Aztec mythology the gods have the choice to destroy humanity once every 52 years.\n\nXolotl was said to be the founder of Texcoco in 1115 AD and reigned until 1232. He was followed by Nopaltzin (1232–1263), Tlotzin (1263–1298), Quinatzin (1298–1357), Techotlalazin (1357–1409), Ixlilxochitl (1409–1418), Nezahualcoyotl (1420–1472), Nezahualpilli (1472–1516), Cacama (1517–1519), Coanchochtzin (1520–1521), and Don Fernando Ixtlilxochitl (1521–1531).\n\nNezahualcoyotl (1403–1473) was a noted poet, philosopher, and patron of the arts. He also had a large botanical and zoological garden, with specimens of plants and animals from throughout the empire and from the more distant lands with which the Empire traded.\n\nNezahualcoyotl's son Nezahualpilli (1464–1515) continued the tradition of patronizing the arts.\n\nIn 1520 the troops of Hernán Cortés occupied the city and killed Cacamatzin, Nezahualpilli's son and the last independent \"tlatoani\", installing Ixtlilxochitl II as a puppet ruler. Cortés made Texcoco his base and employed Texcoco warriors in the Siege of Tenochtitlan.\n\nA descendant of the royal line, Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl was an official during the colonial era and served as governor of Texcoco.\n\nFrom 1827 to 1830, Texcoco was the capital of the State of Mexico.\n\n\n"}

The artwork - an environmental piece consisting of granite block designs among a landscape - cost $40,000 to create in 1985.\n\n\"Untitled\" is a large-scale outdoor piece, covering some on a parcel nested between Alewife Brook Parkway (MA-2/US-3/MA-16), the main station entrance, and the massive 5-story parking garage. An elongated artificial pond is surrounded by a grassy area with trees and decorative pavers, intended to be a \"usable space for MBTA commuters and community residents\" while also serving as part of the drainage system necessary for the large concrete garage structure. Like several other works from the Arts on the Line project, \"Untitled\" includes stone monoliths. Arranged around one corner of the work, the large granite bollards are arranged mostly horizontally and vertical save for one angled block resting upon two others. The blocks were designed to be durable, lasting as long as 75 years, as per City of Cambridge public art standards applied to the project.\n\n\"Untitled\" incorporates various elements of Fleischner's artistic style. Fleischner was primarily known at the time as an environmental sculptor who had created installations like \"The Maze\", an outdoor metal labyrinth at University of Massachusetts Amherst, and \"Untitled\" was intended as environmentally beneficial to the station area as well as merely artistic. Other works of his also include monolithic, rectangular granite components as parts of large-scale sculptures.\n\n\"Untitled\" was created as a part of the MBTA and the Cambridge Arts Council's Arts on the Line program. This first of its kind program was devised to bring art into the MBTA's planned Northwest Extension of the Red Line subway stations in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and became a model for similar drives for public art across the country. This installation was one of 20 artworks created for this program, out of over 400 proposals submitted by artists for artworks spread out across five different newly created subway stations. The first 20 artworks, including this one, were completed with a total cost of $695,000 USD, or one-half of one percent of the total construction cost of the Red Line Northwest Extension. \"Untitled\" was funded by a $40,000 grant in 1980 from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nMany artworks in the project produced friction between artists and architects, and \"Untitled\" was no exception. Harry Ellenzweig, who designed the brutalist station and parking garage, wanted the planned trees removed from Fleischner's design. Pallas Lombardi, who directed much of the Arts on the Line project and served as a liaison with the Cambridge City Council, recalled in a 1987 article that \"Harry insisted that Richard not plant trees along the garage, saying bus exhaust would kill them, but I think perhaps he didn't want trees hiding his beautiful garage.\" However, the artwork as finally built includes a row of trees along a footpath running around the pond. \"Untitled\" opened to the public on or shortly after March 30, 1985, when Alewife station opened.\n\nMBTA - Red Line Art Collection\n"}

{"id": "39662613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39662613", "title": "Women in Mexico", "text": "Women in Mexico\n\nThe status of women in Mexico has changed significantly over time. Until the twentieth century, Mexico was an overwhelmingly rural country, with rural women's status defined within the context of the family and local community. With urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century, following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire, cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages. Roman Catholicism in Mexico has shaped societal attitudes about women's social role, emphasizing the role of women as nurturers of the family, with the Virgin Mary as a model. Marianismo has been an ideal, with women's role as being within the family under the authority of men. In the twentieth century, Mexican women made great strides towards a more equal legal and social status. In 1953 women in Mexico were granted the right to vote in national elections.\n\nUrban women in Mexico worked in factories, the earliest being the tobacco factories set up in major Mexican cities as part of the lucrative tobacco monopoly. Women ran a variety of enterprises in the colonial era, with the widows of elite businessmen continuing to run the family business. In the prehispanic and colonial periods, non-elite women were small-scale sellers in markets. In the late nineteenth century, as Mexico allowed foreign investment in industrial enterprises, women found increased opportunities to work outside the home. Women can now be seen working in factories, portable food carts, and owning their own business. “In 1910, women made up 14% of the workforce, by 2008 they were 38%”.\n\nMexican women face discrimination and at times harassment from the men exercising machismo against them. Although women in Mexico are making great advances, they are faced with the traditional expectation of being the head of the household. Researcher Margarita Valdés noted that while there are few inequities imposed by law or policy in Mexico, gender inequalities perpetuated by social structures and Mexican cultural expectations limit the capabilities of Mexican women.\n\nAs of 2014, Mexico has the 16th highest female homicide rate in the world.\n\nThe Mayan civilization was initially established during the Pre-Classic period (c. 2000 BC to 250 AD). According to the consensus chronology of Mesoamerica, many Mayan cities reached their highest state of development during the Classical period (c. 250 to 900 AD), and continued throughout the post-Classical period until the arrival of the Spanish in 1519 AD. Women within Mayan society were limited in regards to status, marriage, and inheritance. In all pre-Columbian societies, marriage was the ideal state for women beyond the age of puberty. Noble women were often married to the rulers of neighboring kingdoms, thus creating dynastic alliances \n\nAlthough the majority of these women had few political responsibilities, they were vital to the political fabric of the state. Elite women enjoyed a high status within their society and were sometimes rulers of city states. Among a handful of female rulers were Lady Ahpo-Katum of Piedras Negras and Lady Apho-He of Palenque. Although women had little political influence, Mayan glyph data include many scenes with a female participating in various public activities and genealogies trace male rulers' right to power through female members of their family.\n\nWomen could not own or inherit land. They owned what could be termed feminine goods which included household objects, domestic animals, beehives, and their own clothing. Women could bequeath their property, but it was gender specific and was usually not of much value.\n\nThe word 'Aztec' refers to certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Náhuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the 1300 A.D. to 1500 A.D. Women within Aztec society were groomed from birth to be wives and mothers and to produce tribute goods that each household owed. Each girl was given small spindles and shuttles to symbolize her future role in household production. Her umbilical cord was buried near the fireplace of her house in the hope that she would be a good keeper of the home.\n\nGrowing up, unmarried girls were expected to be virgins and were closely chaperoned to ensure their virginity stayed intact until their marriage. Girls were married soon after reaching puberty as marriage was the ideal state for women. It is estimated that as many as ninety-five percent of indigenous women were married. Couples were expected to stay together, however Aztec society did recognize divorce, with each partner retaining their own property brought into the marriage after divorce.\n\nSimilar to Mayan society, Aztec noblewomen had little choice in their marriage as it was a matter of state policy to create alliances. In regards to inheritance and property rights, Aztec women were severely limited. Although women were allowed to inherit property, their rights to it were more to usage rights. Property given to children was much freeing where it could be bequeathed or sold.\n\nWhen the Spanish conquistadores arrived in Mexico, they needed help to conquer the land. Although often overlooked in the history of the conquest, individual women facilitated the defeat of the powerful Aztec Empire. Women possessed knowledge of the land and the local language. One of the most notable women who assisted Hernán Cortés during the conquest period of Mexico was Doña Marina, or Malinche, who knew both the Nahuatl and Mayan language and later learned Spanish.\n\nBorn a Nahua, or an Aztec, Marina was sold into slavery by her own people to the Mayans and eventually was given to Cortés as a payment of tribute. To Cortés, Doña Marina was a valuable asset in overthrowing the Aztec empire based in Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City) and was always seen at his side, even during battles with the Aztecs and Mayans.\n\nMalinche had become the translator and the mistress of Hernán Cortés. No matter how useful Doña Marina was to Cortés, he was “reluctant to give Doña Marina credit, referring to her as ‘my interpreter, who is an Indian woman’”. During the conquest women were viewed as objects that could be exploited by men to gain a higher standing in society. Malinche was considered a spoil of conquest to the males surrounding her and originally intended to sexually please the soldiers.\n\nJust like Malinche, many women were offered to the conquistadors as an offering because both cultures viewed females as objects to be presented to others. Since few women traveled to the New World, native females were considered a treasure that needed to be Christianized. It is believed that there were ulterior motives in the Christianization of indigenous individuals, especially women. Conquistadores were quick to convert the women and distribute them amongst themselves.\n\nThe division of social classes was essential and such divisions were expressed through the attire worn by individuals. Elite and upper class women could afford expensive textiles imported from Spain. Due to the strong system of racial hierarchy, known as the \"sistema de castas\", women tended to dress in accordance with their level of wealth and racial status. The racial hierarchy divided society first through separating the \"República de Españoles\", which was the Hispanic sphere encompassing Spaniards, (Españoles) both peninsular- and American-born; \"Negros\" (Africans); \"Mulatos\" (mixed Negro and Español); \"Mestizos\" (mixed Español and Indian); and offspring of further mixed-race pairings. Regardless of the social status of Indian women, she would dress in compliance with Indian customs. Wealthy females were able to purchase superior materials for clothing.\n\nThe importance placed upon social class caused purity of blood to become a factor in regards to marriage. Women were affected by these policies as it was required for both men and women to submit documents proving their blood purity. European men sought elite Mexican women to marry and have children with, in order to retain or gain a higher status in society. Problems that occurred with providing documentation in blood purity are that males were the ones who were called as a witness. Women rarely were able to defend their purity and had to rely on men from the community.\n\nRegardless of social class, women in eighteenth century Mexico City usually married for the first time between the ages of 17 and 27, with a median age of 20.5 years. Women were inclined to marry individuals belonging to the same social group as their fathers.\n\nEducation for women was surrounded by religion. Individuals believed that girls should be educated enough to read the bible and religious devotionals, but should not be taught to write. When girls were provided with an education, they would live in convents and be instructed by nuns, with education being significantly limited. Of all the women who sought entry into Mexico City's convent of Corpus Christi, only 10 percent of elite Indian women had a formal education.\n\nThe Mexican War of Independence was an armed conflict between the Mexican people and Spain. It began with the Grito de Dolores on September 16 of 1810 and officially ended on September 27 of 1821 when army forces marched into Mexico City. Independence affected women in both positive and negatives ways. Prior to the independence, women were only allowed to act as their children's guardians until the age of seven in cases of separation of widowhood. Post-independence laws allowed women to serve as guardians until the age of majority. Women continued to occupy domestic service positions although economic instability led to many households ending employment of domestic servants.\n\nThe Mexican revolution began in 1910 with an uprising led by Francisco I. Madero against the longstanding regime of Porfirio Diaz. The military phase is generally considered to have lasted through 1920. Most often it is the case that women involved in war are overlooked. Although the revolution is attributed to men, it is important to note the dedication and participation women contributed, just as much as their male counterparts. Poor mestiza and indigenous women had a strong presence in the revolutionary conflict becoming camp followers often referred to in Mexico as soldaderas.\n\nMost often, these women followed the army when a male relative joined and provided essential services such as food preparation, tending to the wounded, mending clothing, burying the dead, and retrieval of items from the battlefield. Women involved in the revolution were just as laden if not more so than men, carrying food, cooking supplies, and bedding. Many soldaderas took their children with them, often because their husband had joined or been conscripted into the army. In 1914, a count of Pancho Villa’s forces included 4,557 male soldiers, 1,256 soldaderas, and 554 children many of whom were babies or toddlers strapped to their mother’s backs. Many women picked up arms and joined in combat alongside men, often when a male comrade, their husband or brother had fallen.\n\nThere were also many cases of women who fought in the revolution disguised as men, however most returned to female identities once the conflict had ended. The lasting impacts of the revolution have proved mixed at best. The revolution promised reforms and greater rights for women to one extent or another, but failed to live up to its promises. Thousands of women fought in the battles and provided necessary services to the armies, however their contributions have largely been forgotten and viewed as merely supportive.\n\nThere had been agitation for women's suffrage in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, and both Francisco Madero and Venustiano Carranza were sympathetic to women's issues, both having female private secretaries who influenced their thinking on the matter. Carranza's secretary Hermila Galindo was an important feminist activist, who in collaboration with others founded a feminist magazine \"La Mujer Moderna\" that folded in 1919, but until then advocated for women's rights. Mexican feminist Andrea Villarreal was active agitating against the Díaz regime in the Mexican Liberal Party and was involved with \"La Mujer Moderna\", until it ceased publication. She was known as the \"Mexican Joan of Arc\" and was a woman represented in U.S. artist Judy Chicago's dinner party.\n\nCarranza made changes in family and marital law with long-lasting consequences. In December 1914, he issued a decree that allowed for divorce under certain circumstances. His initial decree was then expanded when he became president in 1916, which in addition to divorce \"gave women the right to alimony and to the management of property, and other similar rights.\"\n\nAs of 2014, Mexico has the 16th highest rate of homicides committed against women in the world. This rate has been on the rise since 2007.\n\nAccording to the 2013 Human Rights Watch, many women do not seek out legal redress after being victims of domestic violence and sexual assault because \"the severity of punishments for some sexual offenses are contingent on the \"chastity\" of the victim and \"those who do report them are generally met with suspicion, apathy, and disrespect.\"\n\nAccording to a 1997 study by Kaja Finkler, domestic abuse \"is embedded in gender and marital relations fostered in Mexican women's dependence on their spouses for subsistence and for self-esteem, sustained by ideologies of romantic love, by family structure and residential arrangements.\"\n\nMexican women are at risk for HIV infection because they often are unable to negotiate condom use. According to published research by Olivarrieta and Sotelo (1996) and others, the prevalence of domestic violence against women in Mexican marital relationships varies at between 30 and 60 percent of relationships. In this context, requesting condom use with a stable partner is perceived as a sign of infidelity and asking to use a condom can result in domestic violence.\n\nIn Mexico City, the area of Iztapalapa has the highest rates of rape, violence against women, and domestic violence in the capital.\n\nGender violence is more prevalent in regions along the Mexico-US border and in areas of high drug trading activity and drug violence. The phenomenon of the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez involves the violent deaths of hundreds of women and girls since 1993 in the northern Mexican region of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, a border city across the Rio Grande from the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas. As of February 2005, the number of murdered women in Ciudad Juarez since 1993 is estimated to be more than 370.\n\nEven as late as the 1960s, the use of contraceptives was prohibited by civil law, but there were private clinics where elite women could access care.\n\nSurging birthrates in Mexico in the 1960s and 70s became a political issue, particularly as agriculture was less productive and Mexico was no longer self-sufficient in food. As Mexico became more urban and industrialized, the government formulated and implemented family planning policies in the 1970s and 80s that aimed at educating Mexicans about the advantages of controlling fertility. A key component of the educational campaign was the creation of telenovelas (soap operas) that conveyed the government's message about the virtues of family planning. Mexico pioneered the use of soap operas to shape public attitudes on sensitive issues in a format both accessible and enjoyable to a wide range of viewers. Mexico's success in reducing the increase of its population has been the subject of scholarly study.\n\nContraception is still a big issue for Mexican women with a population of 107 million. It is the second most populated nation in Latin America. The population trend is even expected to grow in size in a little over thirty years. With a population that keeps increasing it was the first nation in 1973 to establish a family planning program. It is called MEXFAM (The Mexican Family Planning Association); the program has been recorded to have decreased Mexican households from 7.2 children to 2.4 in 1999.\n\nIn spite of these promising numbers contraceptive use in rural areas is still far lower than that of urban areas. Approximately 25% of Mexican women live in rural areas, and of that, only 44% of those use birth control, and their fertility rate, 4.7%, is almost twice that of urban women.” Mexico was even able to incorporate a sexual education program in the schools to educate on contraception, but with many young girls living in rural areas, they are usually not able to attend.\n\nThere are still persisting inequalities between levels of sexual experience between females and males. In a recent national survey of Mexican youth, 22% of men and 11% of women of the age 16 had admitted to having experienced sexual intercourse. However, these rates for both men and women remain fairly low due to the cultural perception that it is inappropriate to engage in intercourse before marriage. This shared cultural belief stems from the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church which has had great influence over Latin American cultures.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5591387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5591387", "title": "Zafar Bangash", "text": "Zafar Bangash\n\nZafar Bangash (Urdu: ظفر بنگش) is a noted Islamic movement journalist and commentator in Toronto, Canada. Bangash is Director of the Institute of Contemporary Islamic Thought (ICIT), and president of the Islamic Society of York Region, a suburb of Toronto. He is Imam at the Islamic Society of York Region's Mosque and community centre in Richmond Hill, Ontario. He is a former editor of \"Crescent International\" newsmagazine, and a Trustee and formerly assistant director of the Muslim Institute, London, where he worked with Dr Kalim Siddiqui (1931–1996), the founder of the Muslim Institute and Leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain. Bangash is also co-founder of the Muslim Unity Group.\n\nHe is best known for his commentaries current affairs while editor of \"Crescent International\". Though he stepped down as editor since joining the ICIT, he continues as a columnist and contributor to \"Crescent\".\n\nIn 2007, as a spokesperson for the Muslim Unity Group in Toronto, Bangash appeared with other Muslim leaders at a Toronto press conference calling for the Ontario government and Toronto District School Board to address the problem of increased harassment of Muslims and racial minorities since 9-11.\n\nHe was the keynote speaker at a 2007 Marxist conference in Toronto prompting Bangash critic Tarek Fatah of the liberal Muslim Canadian Congress to comment \"For atheists, considered worthy of the death penalty by Islamists, to team up with their ultimate opponents in attacking Canadian civic society, demonstrates the fundamental bankruptcy of these two political ideologies.\" Bangash justified his collaboration with secular leftists saying \"The issues of justice, inequality and poverty are common themes we can work together on. They are concerns of conscience.\"\n\nBangash was the focus of controversy when his association with a planned mosque in Newmarket, Ontario was used as a rallying point by opponents attempting to convince the municipality to rescind zoning approval for the building. A group called \"Concerned Citizens Against Terror for Citizens of Newmarket\" led by Ron Banerjee of the Canadian Hindu Advocacy and Meir Weinstein of the Jewish Defence League organised protests and a public meeting against the mosque's construction. Banerjee claimed that Bangash himself posed a \"clear and present danger to the safety and security\" of the country. The protest group was accused by one community member of not being members of the community and coming in from outside for the purpose of \"stirring the pot\". Mosque leaders have said that while Bangash is president of the Islamic Society of York Region to which the new mosque belongs, he is not the mosque's imam and has no direct involvement with the facility.\n\nIn June 2007, the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF) honoured Bangash at a gala dinner for his \"unwavering\" support of Palestine. CAF President Khaled Mouammar also defended Bangash, stating that \"he is a man of dignity\" and that \"he has no blood on his hands like those Israeli war criminals who come to Canada and are received by our politicians, like Ariel Sharon.\"\nOn 14 February 2010, at a conference entitled \"Media War on Islam,\" Bangash stated the \"Israeli-owned\" International Consultants on Targeted Security runs security at Amsterdam airport, and therefore \"the Israelis are in control of security,\" and thus allowed Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to board a Detroit-bound plane with concealed explosives.\n\nBangash is a staunch supporter of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran and has called for Islamic revolutions in other countries, stating that \"Muslims must strive to overthrow the oppressive systems in their societies through Islamic revolutions, and not by participating in fraudulent elections organized by the elites operating through various political parties that actually divide the people.\" Tarek Fatah describes him as the \"unofficial spokesperson for the Iranian regime in Canada.\" However, Bangash has denied being an advocate of creating an Islamic theocracy telling the \"Toronto Star\" \"I am suggesting not necessarily an Iranian-style theocracy but I am advocating that people in the Muslim world should get rid of their corrupt regimes in the same way as the people of Iran got rid of the corrupt regime of the shah, of course.\"\n\nIn December 2009 following the presidential election protests in Iran, Bangash wrote an article in \"Crescent International\" in which he denied the alleged fraud in the Iranian elections and called the protesters a \"small and rowdy mob\" who wanted to \"destroy the Islamic system of government\" in Iran\n\nIn 2004, the Toronto District School Board proposed the introduction of \"anti-homophobia education\" at a downtown Toronto school. Bangash supported the right of Muslim parents to exclude their children from classes discussing families with same-sex parents. \"We don't want our children subject to that kind of thinking. It's very clear in our belief that marriage is between a man and a woman. It goes against the core beliefs of Muslims; our understanding springs directly from the Qur'an,\" said Bangash.\n\nBangash opposes the United States, calling it \"the greediest, most exploitative, most manipulative, most hypocritical and most ruthless power that the world has ever known.\" He has also written that \"unless the US and Israel realise that their murderous policies, far from cowing the Muslims, will only intensify hatred for them, there will be peace neither in the Muslim world nor for the US and its zionist surrogate, Israel.\"\n\nIn an interview with on the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Bangash stated that:\n\"the imam's [Ayatollah Khomeini] designation of the U.S. as a great Satan was very precise. It emerged from a very careful study and understanding of the behaviour of the United States government and its policies down the generations...It has perpetrated over there [in Iraq] under the guise of delivering democracy and freedom when tens of thousands if not hundred of thousands of innocent people have been murdered in cold blood similar crimes are being perpetrated in Palestine by the US support of the Zionist occupiers of Palestine... It is an evil power that it needs to be dealt with and it needs to be continued and put in its place.\"\nHe told the \"National Post\" that he believes that the US government knew of Osama bin Laden's plans to launch the 9/11 attacks in advance and allowed them to occur to provide a pretext for attacking Afghanistan.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Islam Times\" in October 2010, Bangash stated that \"There is little doubt that the US is in terminal decline. Financially it is bankrupt and living on borrowed money. Its military has been defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan and stretched to the limit...Politically, the US is virtually in a state of civil war.\" He further stated that \"As the US and the West suffer defeat at the hands of Muslims in such places as Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and elsewhere, they will become more oppressive toward Muslims living in their midst.\" He also stated that the decline of the United States \"offers a great opportunity for Muslims to reclaim the high moral ground in global politics and lead errant humanity to its salvation.\"\n\nIn August 2012, Bangash spoke at an Al-Quds Day protest held outside the American Consulate in Toronto, where he stated (to cheers of \"Allahu Akbar\"):\n\nAt a protest outside the American consulate in Toronto on 22 September 2012, Bangash praised the crowd, stating that \"You fulfilled your duty today and you delivered a slap on the face of our enemies whether they are in the United States or the Zionist state of Israel.\"\n\nIn an article published in 2001, Banagash rejected the idea of a two-state solution or a power-sharing arrangement between Jews and Palestinians. He referred to Israelis as \"thieves and bandits from Europe and America\" and should go \"back where they came from:the US, Canada Europe, Russia, or whoever is willing to take them in.\" Bangash has also stated that \"Zionist thugs will have to vacate every inch of Palestine if there is to be justice (and therefore peace) in that tortured land.\" At the Toronto Peace & Justice Conference in March 2006, Bangash gave a speech in which he stated that \"for the state of Israel, peace would mean when all the Palestinians have been put into the graveyard, six feet down.\"\n\nOn the question of suicide bombing, Bangash told the \"Vancouver Sun\" that he opposes the targeting of innocent civilians. He argues that suicide bombing is an act of desperation by a people who do not have the tanks, aircraft and advanced weaponry – \"it's the Israelis who have them, they are using them, and people under occupation have the right under international law to resist their occupiers.\" He also claimed that suicide bombers usually attack military targets.\n\nAt an Al-Quds Day Rally at Queen's Park in August 2011, Bangash stated that \"This black man in the White House, Barack Obama... He would rather have Americans starve to death but he cannot say no to the Zionist parasitical state...That is what makes them racists, that is what makes them inhuman, that is what makes them barbarians.\" In the same speech, Bangash expressed his vision that Israel will cease to exist and will be replaced by an Islamic regime, stating that:\n“Allah willing, I see that day when we, the Muslims, will march on Palestine and liberate Palestine for all the people in the world. For the Jewish people, for the Christian people and for the Muslim people, and under Islamic law they will all be living as equal citizens.”\n\nAt an Al-Quds Day rally held in August 2013, Bangash stated that Queen's Park has become a \"Zionist occupied territory\" and that charged that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne \"are leading Canada in the wrong direction.\" Bangash also called for the rally's participants to \"continue to speak for the Palestinians under oppression\" until \"all of Palestine is liberated from Zionist occupation\" and predicted that \"Zionism will be eternally shamed.\"\n\nBangash was active in protests against the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war and at one point elicited cheers when he announced the number of Israeli soldiers killed by Hezbollah forces during the conflict.\n\nBangash has criticised the Taliban and Osama bin Laden by saying their strategy was \"the most stupid approach to take because you cannot convince the U.S. by attacking the U.S. You cannot force the U.S. to change its policies; you have to change your own situation in Muslim countries.\" He has also criticised Bin Laden's call for \"jihad\" against the West saying \"An individual cannot issue a jihad... Only highly qualified scholars respected through the Muslim world can do that, not somebody sitting on some mountain.\"\n\nBangash has spoken at rallies which oppose Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan and call for a national referendum on Canada's continued participation in the war.\n\nBangash told the \"Toronto Star\" that when his Richmond Hill mosque opened, he and his congregation \"went out of our way to contact the neighbours, contact the churches, Jewish groups, all kinds of people. We have invited to this centre United Church ministers to come and speak, Mennonite pastors to come and speak.\" In 2005, the mosque held a service in which every member of the congregation was asked to bring someone who was non-Muslim. Speaking to reporter Michael Valpy, Bangash said that the mosque was packed and that \"The congregation was thrilled by the result\". Following the 9-11 attacks a Mennonite pastor, Gordon Alton, contacted the mosque. Bangash, in his words, \"stretched the rules of Islam\" to the limit and asked Alton to preach at the mosque. \"I think never in history had that been done before,\" Bangash said, \"but I felt we needed to return [his] gesture.\"\n\nPeter Leibovitch, who is Jewish and a long-time friend of Bangash, has defended him against his critics saying \"we live in a free society and have the right to different positions,\" adding that many in the Jewish community don't support decisions made by the Israeli government. \"And a lot of Jews are not happy with (U.S. President) George Bush's new militarism... Zafar Bangash doesn't agree with American foreign policy nor do millions of Canadians. I didn't know it's a crime not to agree with George Bush.\"\n\n\n"}
