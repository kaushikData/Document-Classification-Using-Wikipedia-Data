The schools implicated in the initial announcement were Arizona, Auburn, Louisville, Miami, Oklahoma State, South Carolina, and Southern California (USC).\n\nThe investigation has since spread beyond the individuals and teams initially implicated. Shortly afterwards, multiple media reports indicated that the Elite Youth Basketball League, the grassroots basketball division of Nike, was served with a subpoena by federal investigators. While Nike was not named in the initial documents, one of the 10 individuals arrested on September 26 was a former Nike executive who was working for Adidas when he was arrested.\n\nOn February 23, 2018, Yahoo! Sports published a report, based on \"hundreds of pages of documents\" obtained by the FBI from two agents and an agency implicated in the investigation, that named more than a dozen additional schools and over 25 current and former players as having been potentially implicated in the scandal. Still later, on April 10, Southern District prosecutors added extra criminal counts to the indictment of Gatto, with the added counts specifically naming Kansas and North Carolina State as well as Louisville and Miami.\n\nThe discovery of corruption in basketball stemmed from an investigation of Pittsburgh-based financial planner Marty Blazer by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2016, the SEC charged Blazer with wire fraud and accused him of embezzling over $2 million from several professional athletes to invest in movie projects and finance Ponzi schemes. As part of a plea agreement with the Southern District U.S. Attorney's office, he agreed to become an FBI informant, and would later plead guilty to reduced charges.\n\nEmanuel \"Book\" Richardson, an Arizona assistant since 2009, was among the individuals arrested and indicted in 2017. He was alleged to have met with agent Christian Dawkins and others in June 2017, agreeing to accept a $5,000 bribe to steer Arizona players to Dawkins' sports management company, and was also charged with accepting an additional $15,000 in bribes and paying at least one recruit to commit to the university. Richardson was suspended on September 26, the day after his arrest, and formally fired on January 23, 2018.\n\nArizona lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class in the wake of the initial allegations. Five-star point guard Jahvon Quinerly reopened his recruitment in October, and eventually signed with Villanova. Nassir Little, also a Five-star recruit, cited the investigation as his reason for deciding against attending Arizona. On a wiretap that was played during the trial Merl Code claims that Arizona offered $150,000 for Little.\n\nChuck Person, a former Auburn basketball star who went on to a long National Basketball Association career before going into coaching, was alleged by the FBI to have received over $90,000 in bribes from Rashan Michel, a former NBA and Southeastern Conference referee who ran a custom tailoring shop in Atlanta that had many professional athletes as clients. Person was accused of paying nearly $20,000 to the families of two Auburn recruits. Auburn suspended Person without pay shortly after his arrest. Person was indicted by a federal grand jury and subsequently fired by Auburn on November 7, 2017. In the wake of the indictments, the university retained an outside law firm to launch an internal investigation into the program.\n\nBefore Auburn's exhibition game on November 2, 2017, the school announced that it would hold players Austin Wiley and Danjel Purifoy out of games indefinitely due to eligibility concerns raised over the FBI investigation. They would both be held out of commission throughout the rest of the season, though they returned to playing again after the conclusion of that season.\n\nOn November 8, ESPN reported that head coach Bruce Pearl was refusing to cooperate with the school's internal investigation, and that university officials notified him that his refusal could lead to his firing. The university had been unable to determine whether Pearl had been involved in any violations of law or NCAA rules because the FBI had seized his computers and cell phones as part of its investigation.\n\nOn the same day that the initial arrests were announced, E. J. Montgomery, a highly-touted forward in the 2018 recruiting class who had verbally committed to Auburn in September 2016, announced he would reopen his recruitment. Montgomery would ultimately commit to Kentucky in April 2018.\n\nLouisville was not named directly in the court documents, but the documents mentioned a \"University-6\" that was \"a public research university located in Kentucky\" with \"approximately 22,640 students and over 7,000 faculty and staff members\", and fielding \"approximately 21 varsity sports teams in NCAA Division I competition.\" The state has only two public research universities—the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville—and the details cited in the documents match only Louisville. Gregory Postel, Louisville's interim president, confirmed hours after the FBI announcements that the school was indeed \"University-6\". At the time of the announcement, the Louisville men's basketball program was facing major NCAA sanctions stemming from an earlier sex scandal, which included vacating the 2013 national championship. The NCAA upheld those sanctions on February 20, 2018.\n\nThe documents also alluded to two Louisville coaches, identified only as \"Coach-1\" and \"Coach-2\", and a recruit who signed with Louisville identified as \"Player-10\". The documents allege that the coaches were involved in a scheme by which a \"Company-1\", later identified as Adidas, would funnel $100,000 to the family of \"Player-10\" in exchange for him coming to Louisville. About a month before the scandal broke, Louisville, which has been Adidas' flagship college athletic program since 2016, signed a 10-year, $160 million extension to its then-current apparel contract with the company. The documents indicate that Brad Augustine, a youth basketball coach in Florida who was among the individuals arrested, said the following about \"Coach-2\":No one swings a bigger dick than Coach-2 at Company-1. . . . All [Coach-2] has to do is pick up the phone and call somebody [and say], 'These are my guys.' [And then] they're taking care of us. The day after the complaints were unsealed, CBS News, followed by many other media outlets, reported that \"Coach-2\" was Louisville head coach Rick Pitino. Shortly thereafter, media outlets identified \"Player-10\" as Brian Bowen, a top recruit who had unexpectedly signed with Louisville on June 3, 2017.\n\nAs a result of the scandal, on September 27, 2017, Louisville placed Pitino on unpaid administrative leave and athletic director Tom Jurich on paid administrative leave. Bowen was suspended from the team and withheld from all team activities. In addition, two five-star high school recruits who had verbally committed to join the Louisville program in 2018–19, Anfernee Simons and Courtney Ramey, rescinded their commitments and reopened their recruitment. Simons would try his luck with entering the 2018 NBA Draft as a high school postgraduate. The Cardinals lost a third recruit on October 4 when David Johnson, a guard from the local Trinity High School who was rated as a top-50 prospect in the recruiting class of 2019 and had verbally committed to Louisville, rescinded his commitment (Johnson would re-commit to Louisville a year later.) Two other five-star prospects for 2018 who had placed Louisville within their final choices, Moses Brown and Romeo Langford removed the Cardinals from their lists in the wake of the scandal.\n\nOn October 6 the University of Louisville placed associate head coach Kenny Johnson and assistant coach Jordan Fair on paid administrative leave, and Fair would be fired by Louisville on October 11.\n\nThe Louisville athletics board officially voted to fire Pitino on October 16. Two days later, the university's board of trustees voted 10–3 to fire Jurich with cause.\n\nOn November 8, the Southern District unsealed a new set of indictments against eight of the 10 individuals initially charged. On the same day, NBC News reported that these new documents directly linked Pitino to the alleged scheme to pay Bowen's family. The documents allege that Pitino met in July 2017 with Christian Dawkins, an agent who was formally indicted in both September and November. During that meeting, Dawkins was said to have asked Pitino to call Gatto and request the $100,000 payment to Bowen's family, and Pitino reportedly agreed to make the call to Gatto. The FBI revealed that phone records indicated that Pitino called Gatto three times before Bowen committed to Louisville.\n\nThe April 2018 indictments specifically charge Dawkins and Adidas consultant Merl Code with conspiring with Gatto to commit wire fraud and pay the aforementioned $100,000 to Bowen's family.\n\nLike Louisville, the University of Miami was not directly identified in the court documents, but UM president Julio Frenk confirmed on September 27 that the school was the institution described in said documents as \"University-7\". The confirmation came the day after the attorney for UM head coach Jim Larrañaga said that the coach was unaware of any impropriety in the program. The documents allege that a UM coach identified only as \"Coach-3\" requested that Gatto arrange a $150,000 payment from Adidas to the family of a top high school player identified as \"Player-12\" in an attempt to keep him from signing with a \"University-4\" that was sponsored by a rival apparel company. This alleged $150,000 payment was also included in the April 2018 indictments.\n\nLamont Evans, at the time an assistant at Oklahoma State, was one of the four coaches arrested on September 26. He was accused of taking at least $22,000 in bribes from two financial advisors, one of whom was acting as an FBI informant. The alleged bribes were offered over a five-year period that included Evans' former tenure as an assistant at South Carolina. Oklahoma State fired Evans on September 28.\n\nOklahoma State lost one potential recruit due to the scandal. On the same day Evans was fired, Antwann Jones, a guard ranked by ESPN as one of the top 50 players in the recruiting class of 2018, rescinded a verbal commitment he had made to the program less than two weeks earlier.\n\nIn the aftermath of the announcement of the FBI investigation, Alabama director of basketball operations Kobie Baker resigned following an internal investigation into the program. This resignation came after the school uncovered that Baker had accepted bribes to steer one of Alabama's incoming freshman players toward financial advisor Rashan Michel. Baker allegedly accepted a $5,000 payment for arranging a meeting between Michel and the father of the player, and an additional $10,000 for helping to steer the player toward Michel.\n\nBefore Alabama's exhibition game on November 6, 2017, the school announced that freshman point guard Collin Sexton would not play that game due to eligibility concerns. Sexton would later be cleared to play for Alabama starting with their November 14 game against Lipscomb.\n\nOn September 26, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against USC assistant coach Tony Bland. The charges allege that Bland and others allegedly received benefits from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services. Following the announcement, USC placed Bland on administrative leave and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation of the matter. After playing in only a few games in the 2017-18 season, on January 15, 2018, sophomore point guard De'Anthony Melton was indefinitely suspended as a result of the investigation. Melton would later remove himself from the university on February 21, 2018, in order to enter the 2018 NBA Draft and begin training for it early, where he was selected 46th by the Houston Rockets and was later traded to the Phoenix Suns on August 31 before the upcoming NBA season began.\n\nOn February 23, 2018, FBI wiretaps reportedly showed that head coach Sean Miller had discussed with Dawkins about paying Deandre Ayton $100,000 to facilitate Ayton's commitment to the University of Arizona, with the monetary situation being dealt with directly to him. If he were implicated in this case, it would have potentially hurt Ayton's chances of finishing out the rest of his season with Arizona, as well as result in him entering the 2018 NBA draft earlier than anticipated, similar to that of De'Anthony Melton. The following day, Miller notified the team that he would not coach in that night's game against Oregon, with associate coach Lorenzo Romar coaching the team instead and Ayton being allowed to play for Arizona that game. However, Ayton and his family have maintained they did not earn any monetary benefits to attend Arizona, with further information suggesting that Miller's calls to Dawkins were related to the recruitment of another player instead. This ultimately led to Ayton being cleared to finish out the season with Arizona. On March 1, Miller made his first public comments since the reporting on the wiretaps, in which he unequivocally denied any involvement in payments to players. ESPN reported that Miller would coach the team that night against Stanford, with Miller confirmed to remain the coach for Arizona throughout the rest of this season, as well as a bit further beyond that.\n\nArizona, which had already lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class after the initial allegations, initially lost its remaining two 2018 recruits after the new revelations. Power forward Shareef O'Neal, son of Hall of Fame player Shaquille O'Neal and rated as a top-30 prospect, announced on February 24 that he was rescinding a commitment he had made in April 2017 to play at Arizona. Because the younger O'Neal signed a nonbinding financial aid agreement instead of a formal letter of intent, he did not need a release from Arizona to choose a new destination, and he would commit to UCLA three days later. Arizona's only remaining recruit at the time in the 2018 class, point guard Brandon Williams, also did not sign a letter of intent, giving him the option to reopen his recruitment, and he chose to do so on March 2. However, unlike Shareef O'Neal, Williams decided to recommit to Arizona on May 5, 2018.\n\nAccording to the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports, former NC State and current NBA player Dennis Smith Jr. had received $43,500 from ASM Sports, an agency run by reported cooperating government witness Andy Miller, before enrolling at the school. Another document said that Smith had received over $70,000 in loans, with the document also including notes about \"how to recoup the money\" after Smith chose not to sign with ASM Sports.\n\nThe April 2018 indictments specifically charge that Gatto was involved in a scheme to funnel $40,000 to Smith's family in October 2015 in exchange for signing with NC State. Adidas had a well-established relationship with both Smith and NC State, as Smith was playing for an Adidas-sponsored AAU team at the time, and NC State was then (as now) an Adidas-backed program. The indictment also claimed that an NC State coach identified only as \"Coach-4\" was the conduit for this payment. Smith would sign a financial aid agreement with the school in December of that year.\n\nThe ASM documents also claim that current NBA player Isaiah Whitehead received at least $26,000 from ASM while at Seton Hall. He signed with ASM after leaving for the 2017 NBA draft, but later moved to Roc Nation.\n\nFormer LSU player Tim Quarterman allegedly received at least $16,000 from ASM while at the school.\n\nDiamond Stone, who played at Maryland in the 2015–16 season, allegedly received over $14,000 from ASM. The school launched an internal investigation into possible ties with the scandal, with head coach Mark Turgeon denying that he or any of his staff members had any involvement with the agency.\n\nThe April 2018 indictments peripherally linked Maryland and its current apparel provider, Under Armour, to the scandal in a completely separate context, although neither was explicitly named in those documents. The FBI alleged that Gatto and a co-conspirator identified in the documents as \"CC-3\" agreed to make payments to the guardian of a 2017 recruit who was identified by media as Silvio De Sousa. According to the documents, the guardian told \"CC-3\" that he had received illicit payments from individuals connected with Under Armour in exchange for De Sousa's commitment to Maryland. The guardian also indicated that De Sousa preferred to go to Kansas, but that he would need to repay the illicit payments to facilitate the player's wishes. Gatto and \"CC-3\" then allegedly paid the guardian $20,000. De Sousa, who had been considered by most recruiting experts as a virtual lock to attend Maryland, committed to Kansas on August 30, 2017. It should also be noted that shortly after the 2018 indictments were unsealed, De Sousa's guardian denied accepting any illicit payments.\n\nA spreadsheet in the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports listed a $12,000 payment to a prospect identified as \"BAM\". A later note in the document identifies this individual as Bam Adebayo, who played only one season at Kentucky in 2016–17. Other documents claim that Adebayo received $36,500 in loans. Additionally, then-current Wildcats player Kevin Knox was listed among several players who had met or dined with Dawkins, or whose families had done so.\n\nMarkelle Fultz, who played a season at Washington before leaving to become the top pick in the 2017 NBA draft, allegedly received $10,000 from ASM.\n\nMelton would ultimately not be the only USC player implicated. The ASM documents claim that two other current USC players, or individuals closely associated with them, had received payments from the company.\n\nKyle Kuzma, a 2017 first-round NBA draft pick, was listed in the ASM documents as having received $9,500 from the agency while at Utah.\n\nFormer Xavier star Edmond Sumner and his father reportedly received at least $7,000 in advances from ASM during the younger Sumner's college career.\n\nAfter being withheld from play by Louisville amid questions regarding his eligibility stemming from the original revelations, Brian Bowen withdrew from the school and eventually enrolled at South Carolina, though he would not be eligible to play for the Gamecocks' basketball program until January 2019. However, the ASM documents raise more questions about his NCAA eligibility, allegedly listing at least $7,000 in benefits to him and his family during his high school career. That would result in him later rescinding his collegiate entry altogether, instead opting to begin a professional basketball career early, starting with the Sydney Kings in Australia. In addition, P. J. Dozier, a star on South Carolina's 2017 Final Four team, was alleged to have received over $6,000 while at the school.\n\nThe mother of former Kansas (KU) star Josh Jackson, Apples Jones, reportedly received $2,700 from ASM during Jackson's college career.\n\nThe April 2018 indictments raised more serious issues surrounding the Kansas program, which is also sponsored by Adidas. Gatto and the coach of an Adidas-sponsored AAU team were alleged to have given at least $90,000 to the mother of a KU recruit between October 2016 and November 2017 in exchange for the player's commitment to the school. Sources close to the investigation told Yahoo! Sports that this player was Billy Preston, who committed to KU in November 2016 and enrolled at the school in 2017. He played in two exhibition games, but the school did not allow him to play during the beginning 2017–18 season and then left school after questions were raised about his ownership of a car which he was driving at the time of an auto accident. Another member of KU's 2017 recruiting class, Silvio De Sousa, was linked to illicit payments in the 2018 indictments. He also was held out of the beginng 2017–18 season while the school worked with the NCAA to determine his eligibility. In January the NCAA declared him eligible and he became a key reserve during the Jayhawks' Final Four run.\n\nThen-current Texas player Eric Davis Jr. allegedly received $1,500 from ASM. Texas held him out of the team's February 24 game against Oklahoma State. In addition, former Longhorns player Prince Ibeh was found in Dawkins' list of players and/or families who had met with or dined with Dawkins while in high school or college.\n\nThen-current San Diego State player Malik Pope allegedly received $1,400 from ASM. Pope was withheld from the team's February 24 game against San Jose State while the school launched an internal investigation into the allegations. San Diego State cleared Pope to play prior to the Aztecs' February 27 game against Boise State, determining that there was no credible evidence that Pope had received any impermissible benefits.\n\nFormer Clemson star Jaron Blossomgame reportedly received a payment of $1,100 while at the school.\n\nThe ASM documents allege that former Wichita State star Fred VanVleet received at least $1,000 while playing for the school.\n\nThe mother of then-current Michigan State star Miles Bridges reportedly received several hundred dollars in advances from ASM. An internal Michigan State investigation found that allegations that Bridges' mother had received about $400 in cash from Dawkins were false, but confirmed that Dawkins had paid slightly over $70 for a dinner with Bridges family members (though without the player present). Bridges was temporarily ruled ineligible because of the dinner, but his eligibility was restored on February 24, just in time to play for the Spartans' regular season finale at Wisconsin. Bridges made a $40 contribution (the approximate value of his family members' meals at the Dawkins meeting) to a charity of his choice as part of the reinstatement process.\n\nThe ASM documents also indicated that several players, or their family members, had either met or dined with Dawkins while the players were in high school or college. According to a lawyer involved with NCAA compliance issues who was interviewed in the Yahoo! Sports report, merely meeting with an agent is not an NCAA violation, but if the agent pays for a player's or family member's meal, the meal can be considered an \"extra benefit\" under NCAA rules. In addition to the aforementioned Knox and Ibeh, the following then-current and former NCAA players were listed in the ASM documents in this context:\n\n"}

It may be a bankable movie star, a major recording artist, international sports star, social media personality, film director, mogul, or an international TV broadcaster.\n\nThe A-list is part of a larger guide called \"The Hot List\" that has become an industry-standard guide in Hollywood. James Ulmer, the creater of \"The Hot List\", has also developed a \"Hot List of Directors\". The Ulmer scale categorizes the lists into A+, A, B+, B, C, and D listings.\n\nIn popular usage outside the film industry, an \"A-list celebrity\" is any person with an admired or desirable social status. Even socialites with popular press coverage and elite associations have been termed as \"A-list\" celebrities. Similarly, less popular persons and current teen idols are referred to as \"B-list\" – and the ones with lesser fame \"C-list\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" interpreted C-list celebrity as \"that guy (or sometimes that girl), the easy-to-remember but hard-to-name character actor\".\n\n\"D-list\" (or sometimes Z-list) is for a person whose celebrity is so obscure that they are generally only known for appearances as so-called celebrities on panel game shows and reality television. In the late 20th century, D-listers were largely ignored by the entertainment news industry; for example, Paul Lynde, by this point in his career best known for being on the daytime game show \"Hollywood Squares\", went largely unnoticed by the supermarket tabloids, and his homosexuality (which would have drawn scandal for bigger celebrities) went largely unreported. Kathy Griffin, a U.S. comedian who became widely known for her frequent appearances on such programs, used the term in a tongue-in-cheek manner for her 2005 TV special \"The D-List\" and her 2005 TV series \"\". It is also the lowest rating used by U.S. journalist James Ulmer for his Ulmer Scale which ranks the bankability of 1,400 movie actors worldwide. Other successive letters of the alphabet beyond D, such as \"E-list\" or \"Z-list\", are sometimes used for exaggeration or comic effect but effectively have the same meaning as D-list; to the extent that there is a difference, letters further down the alphabet would indicate decreasing levels of fame (for example, regional celebrities such as local news anchors, community theatre actors, or at the bottom of the chain, common persons with no claim to fame whatsoever).\n\nIn the \"\" game, the player's goal is to increase their fame and reputation, starting on the E-list and rising to the A-list.\n\n"}

He belonged to the Qasimid family, descendants of Muhammad, who dominated the Zaidi imamate of Yemen in 1597-1962.\n\nAl-Husayn bin al-Qasim was a son of Imam al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim. At the end of his father's reign, he entertained contacts with the rebellious tribesmen of Hashid and Bakil. However, the rebellion died down and there seem to have been no further consequences for his illoyal conduct. When al-Mutawakkil al-Qasim died some months later, in 1727, al-Husayn went to San'a where, after his father's funeral, he laid claim to the imamate and took the title al-Mansur al-Husayn. He was opposed by another claimant, an-Nasir Muhammad, who was supported by the Hashid and Bakil, and by the lord of Kawkaban. Al-Mansur al-Husayn II retained control over San'a but found reason to pay allegiance to an-Nasir Muhammad. Somewhat later, new trouble flared up. Al-Mansur al-Husayn II was successful in routing his opponent's forces and captured the latter's sons. In about 1729 an-Nasir Muhammad appeared at the court of al-Mansur al-Husayn and submitted. That left the Zaidi state in the hands of al-Mansur al-Husayn II.\n\nThese days witnessed economic changes detrimental to the power of the Zaidi state. Coffee had hitherto been almost solely produced in Yemen, and the rising prices provided great incomes for the country. However, in 1723 coffee began to be imported to Europe from Java, and in the 1740s from the West Indies. The losses of revenue were accompanied by loss of territory. In 1731 the imam's agents in the Aden area were murdered by a chief in Lahej, Fadl bin Ali al-Abdali. When al-Mansur al-Husayn II sent tribesmen to deal with al-Abdali, he took refuge in Yafa. There he persuaded the local sultan to help him driving the imam's forces from Aden and Lahej. From this date (or, in another version, from 1728) the South Yemeni Sultanate of Lahej managed its independence from the Zaidi state. Al-Mansur al-Husayn II was also opposed by his brother Ahmad, who governed Ta'izz and kept the revenues for himself.\n\nIn 1738 a serious crises occurred in the relations between the Zaidi government and the French traders in Mocha. The governor in Mocha had the habit of purchasing goods from foreigners and, instead of paying, promise to deduct future duties. When a debt of 82,000 dollars had accumulated, the French East India Company demanded the governor to pay. As the governor refused, the city was besieged. After a severe reverse, the governor was forced to liquidate the debt. A new treaty was signed, where the duties were lowered. The imam was displeased with the conduct of the governor, who was subsequently recalled. The imam died in 1748, and was succeeded by his son al-Mahdi Abbas.\n\n"}

Depending on the system of collaboration, individuals may also provide feedback or vote on whether an article is newsworthy. A single collaborative news story, therefore, may encompass multiple authors, varying articles, and ranged perspectives.\n\nProfessional and amateur reporters may work together to develop collaborative news articles, or mainstream media sites may gather amateur blog posts to complement reporting.\n\nCollaborative journalists either contribute directly to stories, sometimes through a wiki-style collaboration platform, or build upon the story externally, often through personal blogs. Collaborative journalists develop or examine a story one piece at a time. This contrasts the deadline and completion-centered nature of traditional media. A story is built upon continually, and a popular story may receive daily updates. Through combined authorship, collaborative journalism is thought by some to offer an increased independence of thought and experience unavailable to traditional media.\n\nSuccessful collaborative journalism projects require a participatory community with respect for content. Ross Mayfield, CEO of SocialText, has commented on wiki-style collaborative journalism:\n\n\"Most user-generated content isn't content, but conversation. Cultivating community is a decided practice. It boils down to the social contract you make with your readers-turned-writers. If they trust that their effort and words will be appropriated appropriately, while providing social incentives for participation, it can very well work.\"\n\nCollaborative journalism emerged through the internet in the early 2000s, and developed gradually through various online outlets. As examples, Wikinews was founded in 2003, and NewsVine in 2005.\n\nThe Panama Papers project may be the largest example of a journalistic consortium to date. It began sometime in 2015 (date?) when Bastian Obermayer, an investigative reporter with the south German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, was contacted by an anonymous source and offered the trove of 11.5 million electronic documents from Mossack Fonseca, the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm detailing a web of secret offshore deals and loans worth billions of dollars, and details of tax avoidance designs in numerous countries. The newspaper's editors decided they could not handle the massive volume of information alone and initiated a collaborative journalistic consortium including more than 140 journalists and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, a project of the nonprofit Center for Public Integrity.\n\nThe European Investigative Collaborations (EIC) working with \"over 60 journalists in 14 countries\" published a \"series of articles called \"Football Leaks\"—the \"largest leak in sports history\". \"Football Leaks\" \"led to the prosecution of football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and coach Jose Mourinho.\" EIC was established in the fall of 2015 with founding members that include \"Der Spiegel\", \"El Mundo\", \"Médiapart\", the Romanian Centre for Investigative Journalism (CRJI), and \"Le Soir\".\n\n\n\"Link journalism\", a phrase coined by Scott Karp in 2008, is \"a form of collaborative journalism in which a news story's writer provides external links within the story to reporting or other sources on the web.\" These links are meant to complement, enhance, or add context to the original reporting. Jeff Jarvis, from the Graduate School of Journalism's new media program at the City University of New York, has said that link journalism creates a \"new architecture of news.\"\n\nCollaborative journalism has been implemented in several different ways. Wikinews, the \"free-content online news source,\" lets any user edit or create a news story, similar in style to Wikipedia. Several mainstream news sites have adopted a collaborative journalism approach toward news, through use of news aggregation. The Washington Post has developed a political site which links to related content from other news sites. NBC links to local newspapers, radio broadcasts, online videos, and blogs on its local television stations' sites. The sites do not separate articles written by NBC staff and links to outside sources.\nThe New York Times has introduced a \"Times Extra\" website feature which acts posts links to outside news sites. Commenting on the launch of \"Times Extra\", Marc Frons, CTO for Digital Operations at the New York Times, said:\n\n“In the past, I think many news organizations were afraid to link to other Web sites out of fear that they might be sending people to an unreliable source or that their readers would never return. But those fears were largely misplaced and we’ve seen a much more open policy when it comes to pointing readers at useful content elsewhere on the Web.\"\nOther sites exhibit collaborative journalism through aggregation. On the site NewsVine, for example, wire stories from the Associated Press complement user-generated stories and blog posts. Reddit and other news aggregation sites may also act as collaborative journalism sites, depending on where content originates.\n\nDue to the increase in collaborative journalism, several organizations have begun to offer grants or awards for these types of projects. For example, Online Journalism Awards (launched in May 2000) added a new award category for collaborations and partnerships. Clean Energy Wire offers grants for collaborative journalism projects on the topic of energy or the climate. The annual Hostwriter Prize awards money to support pitches and published collaborative projects by journalists.\n\nCollaborative journalism has received some criticism:\n"}

{"id": "1309150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1309150", "title": "Death by boiling", "text": "Death by boiling\n\nDeath by boiling is a method of execution in which a person is killed by being immersed in a boiling liquid. While not as common as other methods of execution, boiling to death has been used in many parts of Europe and Asia.\nExecutions of this type were often carried out using a large vessel such as a cauldron or a sealed kettle that was filled with a liquid such as water, oil, tar, or tallow, and a hook and pulley system.\n\nIn England, the 9th statute passed in 1531 (the 22nd year of the reign of King Henry VIII) made boiling alive the prescriptive form of capital punishment for murder committed by poisoning, which by the same Act was defined as High Treason. This arose from an incident in which the Bishop of Rochester's cook, Richard Roose, gave several people poisoned porridge, resulting in two deaths in February 1531. A partial confession having been extracted by torture, the sentence was thus imposed by attainder and without benefit of clergy. A contemporary chronicle reports the following:\n\nBoiling to death was employed again in 1542 for a woman, Margaret Davy, who had also used poison. During the reign of Edward VI, in 1547, the 1531 act was repealed.\n\nScotland has several traditions of persons boiled to death. For example, in 1222, with the consent of Jon Haraldsson, the \"Bloody Earl\" of Orkney, the bishop of Caithness Adam of Melrose and a monk named Surlo, are said to have been boiled to death by angry husbandmen over the bishop's aggressive means of collecting tithes. Alexander II is said to have executed upwards to eighty persons as a punishment for the crime, and the earl fled his lands. According to the Melrose Chronicle, Adam of Melrose was \"burned alive\", rather than boiled, and Alexander III executed up to 400. William de Soules, a nobleman involved in a conspiracy against Robert the Bruce, was reputed to be a sorcerer consorting with evil spirits, and was boiled alive in 1321 at Ninestane Rig. Around 1420, Melville, the sheriff of the Mearns and laird of Glenbervie, who was resented for his strictness, was apprehended by some other nobles and thrown into the kettle. The nobles are said each to have taken a spoonful of the brew afterwards.\n\nBoiling as an execution method was also used for counterfeiters, swindlers and coin forgers during the Middle Ages.\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, for example, being boiled to death in oil is recorded for coin forgers and extremely grave murderers. In 1392, a man was boiled alive in Nuremberg for having raped and murdered his own mother. Coin forgers were boiled to death in 1452 in Danzig and in 1471 in Stralsund. Even as late as in 1687, a man was boiled to death in oil in Bremen for having been of valuable help to some coin forgers who had escaped justice.\n\nIn the Dutch town of Deventer, the kettle that was used for boiling criminals to death can still be seen.\n\nIn 16th-century Japan, the semi-legendary Japanese bandit Ishikawa Goemon was boiled alive in a large iron kettle-shaped bathtub. His public execution, which might have included his entire family, was done after he failed to kill warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\n\nIn 1675, a Sikh martyr, called Bhai Dayala, was boiled to death in Delhi after he refused to accept Islam. He was put into a cauldron full of cold water which was then heated to boiling point. Sikh scriptures record that Dayala recited the Japji of Guru Nanak and the Sukhmani of Guru Arjan as he died.\n\nThe government of Uzbekistan under Islam Karimov has been alleged to have boiled suspected terrorists.\n\nIn a 2004 document from US Department of State, the following is written:Former ISIS commander Abu Abboud al-Raqqawi referred to ISIS' brutal execution methods, among others, boiling prisoners alive in engine oil:\n\nEarly reports of cannibals from islands in the Pacific, such as Fiji or Papua New Guinea, killing western Christian missionaries were assumed to involve some form of boiling alive. This became a fertile ground for film makers and especially cartoonists, whose clichéd depiction of tourists or missionaries sitting restrained in a large cauldron above a wood fire and surrounded by bone-nosed tribesmen was a staple of popular magazines and film for decades. Examples include the dream sequence in the movie \"Bagdad Café\".\n\n"}

The incident has since become legendary.\n\nThe story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless (becoming \"rōnin\") after their \"daimyō\" (feudal lord) Asano Naganori was compelled to perform \"seppuku\" (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named Kira Yoshinaka, whose title was \"Kōzuke no suke\". After waiting and planning for a year, the \"rōnin\" avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. In turn, they were themselves obliged to commit \"seppuku\" for committing the crime of murder. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the Meiji era, in which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.\n\nFictionalized accounts of the tale of the Forty-seven Rōnin are known as \"Chūshingura.\" The story was popularized in numerous plays, including \"bunraku\" and \"kabuki\". Because of the censorship laws of the shogunate in the \"Genroku\" era, which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some , the first \"Chūshingura\" was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the \"Chūshingura\" survive.\n\nThe \"bakufu\"'s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years later in the late 18th century, when Japanologist Isaac Titsingh first recorded the story of the forty-seven \"rōnin\" as one of the significant events of the \"Genroku\" era. To this day, the story continues to be popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, Sengakuji Temple, where Asano Naganori and the \"rōnin\" are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.\n\nThe event is known in Japan as the , sometimes also referred to as the \"Akō vendetta\". The participants in the revenge are called the or in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the \"Forty-seven Rōnin\" or \"Forty-seven leaderless samurai\" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the .\n\nFor many years, the version of events retold by A. B. Mitford in \"Tales of Old Japan\" (1871) was considered authoritative. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the West. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the Forty-seven Rōnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned. Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.\n\nWhether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:\nMitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as \"proofs\" authenticating the factual basis of his story. These documents were:\n\nIn 1701, two \"daimyōs\", Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori, the young \"daimyō\" of the Akō Domain (a small fiefdom in western Honshū), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the Tsuwano Domain, were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of the Emperor at Edo Castle, during their \"sankin-kōtai\" service to the \"shōgun\".\n\nThese \"daimyō\" names are not fictional, nor is there any question that something actually happened in . What is commonly called \"the Akō incident\" was an actual event.\n\nAsano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi's shogunate. He became upset at them, allegedly either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly moral Confucian. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific \"bakufu\" duties, offence was taken.\n\nInitially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.\n\nHowever, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the \"Matsu no Ōrōka\", the main grand corridor that interconnects the \"Shiro-shoin\" (白書院) and the \"Ōhiroma\" of the \"Honmaru Goten\" (本丸御殿) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.\n\nKira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the \"shōgun\"s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a katana, was completely forbidden in Edo Castle. The \"daimyō\" of Akō had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by \"seppuku\". Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made \"rōnin\" (leaderless).\n\nThis news was carried to Ōishi Kuranosuke Yoshio, Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with \"bakufu\" orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.\n\nOf Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader Ōishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.\n\nKira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The \"rōnin\" saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.\n\nŌishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.\n\nOne day, as Ōishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A Satsuma man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai—by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour—that he abused and insulted Ōishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.\n\nNot too long after, Ōishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the \"rōnin\" took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.\n\nŌishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly Ichiriki Chaya), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. Ōishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid Ōishi of his spies.\n\nKira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his \"retirement\", he then reluctantly let down his guard.\n\nThe rest of the faithful \"rōnin\" now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to Ōishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.\n\nAfter two years, when Ōishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard, and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.\n\nIn , early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, Ōishi and the other \"rōnin\" attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by Ōishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, Ōishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.\n\nOnce Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death. All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which Ōishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.\n\nŌishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there. He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the \"rōnin\" climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge (katakiuchi, 敵討ち). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.\n\nAfter posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, Ōishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but Ōishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.\n\nKira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.\n\nEventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the \"rōnin\" killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but Ōishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.\n\nA renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.\n\nHe refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The \"rōnin\" gathered, and Ōishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira—as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.\n\nAt that, Ōishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. Ōishi indicated he personally would act as a \"kaishakunin\" (\"second\", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.\n\nHowever, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, Ōishi ordered the other \"rōnin\" to pin him down, and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger.\n\nThey then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.\n\nOne of the \"rōnin\", the \"ashigaru\" Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Akō and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the \"rōnin\" turned themselves in.)\n\nAs day was now breaking, they quickly carried Kira's head from his residence to their lord's grave in Sengaku-ji temple, marching about ten kilometers across the city, causing a great stir on the way. The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.\n\nOn arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 \"rōnin\" (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different \"daimyō\".\n\nDuring this time, two friends of Kira came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.\n\nThe shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the \"shōgun\" received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the \"rōnin\". As expected, the \"rōnin\" were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the \"shōgun\" finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit \"seppuku\" instead of having them executed as criminals. It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion. Ōishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed \"seppuku\".\n\nEach of the 46 \"rōnin\" killed himself in . This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the \"forty-six rōnin\"; this refers to the group put to death by the \"shōgun\", while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh \"rōnin\", identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the \"shōgun\" (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades. The assailants who died by \"seppuku\" were subsequently interred on the grounds of Sengaku-ji, in front of the tomb of their master.\n\nThe clothes and arms they wore are still preserved in the temple to this day, along with the drum and whistle; their armor was all home-made, as they had not wanted to arouse suspicion by purchasing any.\n\nThe tombs became a place of great veneration, and people flocked there to pray. The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era. One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on Ōishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that Ōishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the \"rōnin\".\n\nThough the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and finding a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven \"rōnin\" cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the \"rōnin\" had been sentenced to their honorable end.\n\nAsano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original.\n\nBelow are the names of the 47 \"rōnin\" in the following form: family name - pseudonym (\"kemyō\") - real name (\"imina\"). Alternative readings are listed in italics.\nThe \"rōnin\" spent more than 14 months waiting for the \"right time\" for their revenge. It was Yamamoto Tsunetomo, author of the \"Hagakure\", who asked the well known question: \"What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?\" His answer was that the forty-seven \"rōnin\" would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards—bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the \"rōnin\" to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The \"rōnin\" would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time—but this was unimportant.\n\nŌishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.\n\nThe tragedy of the Forty-seven Rōnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.\n\nImmediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the \"rōnin\" had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.\n\nThe incident immediately inspired a succession of \"kabuki\" and \"bunraku\" plays; the first, \"The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga\", appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in Osaka and Kyoto, farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as Manila, to spread the story to the rest of Asia.\n\nThe most successful of the adaptations was a \"bunraku\" puppet play called \"Kanadehon Chūshingura\" (now simply called \"Chūshingura\", or \"Treasury of Loyal Retainers\"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a \"kabuki\" play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.\n\nIn the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of \"shōgun\" Ashikaga Takauji. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became Kō no Moronao and Ōishi became Ōboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the \"rōnin\" were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the \"rōnin\" dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).\n\nThe story was turned into an opera, \"Chūshingura\", by Shigeaki Saegusa in 1997.\n\nThe play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan, the earliest starring Onoe Matsunosuke. The film's release date is questioned, but placed between 1910 and 1917. It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying \"benshi\" narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director Kenji Mizoguchi, who would later direct \"Ugetsu\", to make \"Genroku Chūshingura\". They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar \"rekishi geki\" (\"historical drama\") of \"The Loyal 47 Ronin\". Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source \"Mayama Chūshingura\", a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.\n\nThe 1962 film version directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, \"\", is most familiar to Western audiences. In it, Toshirō Mifune appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series \"Daichūshingura\" as Ōishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic \"Swords of Vengeance\" (\"Akō-jō danzetsu\").\n\nMany Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as \"Daichūshingura\" and the more recent NHK Taiga drama \"Genroku Ryōran\", recount the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the \"Chūshingura,\" while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, \"gaiden\" dramatize events and characters not in the \"Chūshingura\". Kon Ichikawa directed another version in 1994. In 2004, Mitsumasa Saitō directed a 9-episode mini-series starring Ken Matsudaira, who also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the \"Chūshingura\" entitled \"Genroku Ryōran\". In Hirokazu Koreeda's 2006 film \"Hana yori mo nao\", the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin story were used as backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.\n\nMost recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie, titled \"47 Ronin\", released on December 25, 2013, and then again into a more stylized version titled \"Last Knights\", released April 3, 2015.\n\nThe Forty-seven Rōnin is one of the most popular themes in woodblock prints, or \"ukiyo-e\" and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors. One book on subjects depicted in woodblock prints devotes no fewer than seven chapters to the history of the appearance of this theme in woodblocks. Among the artists who produced prints on this subject are Utamaro, Toyokuni, Hokusai, Kunisada, Hiroshige, and Yoshitoshi. However, probably the most widely known woodblocks in the genre are those of Kuniyoshi, who produced at least eleven separate complete series on this subject, along with more than twenty triptychs.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "954420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=954420", "title": "Generation Jones", "text": "Generation Jones\n\nGeneration Jones is a term coined by the author Jonathan Pontell to describe those born from approximately 1954 to 1964, while other sources place the start point at 1956 or 1957. This group is essentially the latter half of the baby boomers to the first years of Generation X. Unlike older baby boomers, most of Generation Jones did not grow up with World War II veterans as fathers, and for them there was no compulsory military service and no defining political cause, as opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War had been for older boomers. \n\nThe name \"Generation Jones\" has several connotations, including a large anonymous generation, a \"keeping up with the Joneses\" competitiveness and the slang word \"jones\" or \"jonesing\", meaning a yearning or craving. It is said that Jonesers were given huge expectations as children in the 1960s, and then confronted with a different reality as they came of age during a long period of mass unemployment and when de-industrialization arrived full force in the mid-late 1970s and 1980s, leaving them with a certain unrequited \"jonesing\" quality for the more prosperous days of the past. \n\nThe generation is noted for coming of age after a huge swath of their older brothers and sisters in the earlier portion of the baby boomer population had come immediately preceding them; thus, many Generation Jones members complain that there was a paucity of resources and privileges available to them that were seemingly abundant to those older boomers born earlier. Therefore, there is a certain level of bitterness about and a \"jonesing\" for the level of freedom and affluence granted to older boomers but denied to their generation.\n\nThe term has enjoyed some currency in political and cultural commentary, including during the 2008 United States presidential election, where Generation Jonesers Barack Obama and Sarah Palin were on presidential tickets.\n\nGeneration Jones has been covered and discussed in newspapers and magazines and on TV and radio shows. Pontell has appeared on TV networks such as CNN, MSNBC, and BBC, discussing the cultural, political, and economic implications of this generation's emergence.\n\nIn the business world, Generation Jones has become a part of the strategic planning of many companies and industries, particularly in the context of targeting Jonesers through marketing efforts. Carat UK, a European media buying agency, has done extensive research into Generation Jones consumers.\n\nPolitically, Generation Jones has emerged as a crucial voting segment in Western elections. In the U.S. 2006 congressional and 2004 presidential elections, and the 2005 U.K. elections, Generation Jones's electoral role was widely described as pivotal by the media and political pollsters. In the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Generation Jones was again seen as a key electoral segment because of the high degree to which its members were swing voters during the election cycle. Influential journalists, like Clarence Page and Peter Fenn, singled out Generation Jones voters as crucial in the final weeks of the campaign.\nNumerous studies have been done by political pollsters and publications analyzing the voting behavior of GenJonesers.\n\nThe election to the presidency of Barack Obama, born in 1961, plus Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, born 1964, focused more attention on Generation Jones. Many journalists, publications, and experts — including Jonathan Alter (\"Newsweek\"), David Brooks (\"The New York Times\") and Karen Tumulty (\"Time\") — have characterized Obama as a member of Generation Jones.\n\nKey characteristics assigned to members are pessimism, distrust of government, and general cynicism.\n\n\n"}

It can be viewed in contrast to a market failure, which is an economic inefficiency that results from the free market itself, and can potentially be corrected through government regulation. The idea of government failure is associated with the policy argument that, even if particular markets may not meet the standard conditions of perfect competition required to ensure social optimality, government intervention may make matters worse rather than better.\n\nAs with a market failure, a government failure is not a failure to bring a particular or favored solution into existence but is rather a problem which prevents an efficient outcome. The problem to be solved need not be a market failure; governments may act to create inefficiencies even when an efficient market solution is possible.\n\nGovernment failure (by definition) does not occur when government action creates winners and losers, making some people better off and others worse off than they would be without governmental regulation. It occurs only when governmental action creates an inefficient outcome, where efficiency would otherwise exist. A defining feature of government failure is where it would be possible for everyone to be better off (a Pareto improvement) under a different regulatory environment. \n\nExamples of government failure include regulatory capture and regulatory arbitrage. Government failure may arise because of unanticipated consequences of a government intervention, or because an inefficient outcome is more politically feasible than a Pareto improvement to it. Government failure can be on both the demand side and the supply side. Demand-side failures include preference-revelation problems and the illogics of voting and collective behaviour. Supply-side failures largely result from principal–agent problem. Also Every other intervention of the government into the market ever was a failure and created ineficiency.\n\nThe phrase \"government failure\" emerged as a term of art in the early 1960s with the rise of intellectual and political criticism of government regulations. Building on the premise that the only legitimate rationale for government regulation was market failure, economists advanced new theories arguing that government interventions in markets were costly and tend to fail. \n\nAn early use of \"government failure\" was by Ronald Coase (1964) in comparing an actual and ideal system of industrial regulation:\n\nRoland McKean used the term in 1965 to suggest limitations on an invisible-hand notion of government behavior. More formal and general analysis followed in such areas as development economics, ecological economics, political science, political economy, public choice theory, and transaction-cost economics.\n\nCrowding out is the displacement of private sector investment by way of higher interest rates, when the government expands its borrowing to finance increased expenditure or tax cuts in excess of revenue. Government spending is also said to crowd out private spending by individuals.\n\nRegulatory arbitrage is a regulated institution's taking advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) risk and the regulatory position.\n\nRegulatory capture is the co-opting of regulatory agencies by members of or the entire regulated industry. Rent seeking and rational ignorance are two of the mechanisms which allow this to happen.\n\nRegulatory risk is the risk faced by private-sector firms that regulatory changes will hurt their business.\n\nAlexander Hamilton of the World Bank Institute argued in 2013 that rent extraction positively correlates with government size even in stable democracies with high income, robust rule of law mechanisms, transparency, and media freedom.\n\n"}

It is first attested in the Homeric epics but it is unlikely to have referred to any particular nation, but rather, to people of African descent in general. The Greek community in Ethiopia is first attested by the presence of craftsmen and sailors in the 18th century (1740) in what was then Abyssinia, who played a part in the commerce between the country and Europe. The explorer James Bruce reported that a number of Greek refugees from Smyrna arrived in Gondar during the reign of the Emperor Iyasu II, who included twelve silversmiths, whom the emperor put to work producing a variety of items for both his court and the churches of Gondar.\n\nThe community saw its heyday in the early part of the 20th century with the establishment of the Holy Metropolis of Axum by the Patriarchate of Alexandria in 1908 and of the Greek organizations in Addis Ababa (1918) and Dire Dawa (1921).\n\nIn the post-war period the community grew to 3,000 persons. It suffered during the revolution that overthrew Haile Selassie in 1974, when the hostility of the Derg towards all foreign communities drastically reduced its size to the current population of about 500.\n\nToday there is still a Greek school located in the capital as well as a Greek Orthodox church in the same city (St. Froumendios). The school has about 120 students, many of whom receive scholarships to continue their studies in Greece.

To conceal their identity they referred to themselves as \"Portuguese\" or \"Spanish\" and practiced their religion secretly. At the time of the British conquest of the island in 1655, General Venables recorded the presence of many \"Portuguese\" in Jamaica. The Jews were allowed to remain after the conquest and began to practice their religion openly. They were granted British citizenship by Cromwell and this was confirmed in 1660 by King Charles. They attained full political rights in 1831. The status of British citizenship enabled ownership of property by the Jews. \n\nJamaica's Jewish population was never large. However, their contribution to the economic and commercial life of the nation has been significant.\n\nIt was formerly believed that only 200 people were religiously practising Jews in Jamaica and that most Jews had migrated out of Jamaica. A recent study has now estimated that nearly 424,000 Jamaicans are descendants of Jewish (Sephardic) immigrants to Jamaica from Portugal and Spain from 1494 to the present, either by birth or ancestry. Jewish documents, gravestones written in Hebrew and recent DNA testing have proven this. While many are non-practicing, it is recorded that over 20,000 Jamaicans religiously identify as Jews. \n\nCommon Jewish surnames in Jamaica are Abrahams, Alexander, Isaacs, Levy, Marish, Lindo, Lyon, Sangster, Myers, Da Silva, De Souza, De Cohen, De Leon, DeMercado, Barrett, Babb, Magnus, Codner, DeCosta, Henriques and Rodriques. \n\nThe Chabad-Lubavitch movement opened a branch in Jamaica in 2014 servicing locals as well as a welcome centre for international visitors.\n\nThe BBC BackaBush Institute, first built in 1885, was the only synagogue in the country until 2014 when Chabad opened a second synagogue in Montego Bay. The congregation has their own siddur, blending together Spanish-Portuguese tradition and British Liberal and American Reform liturgy. The Hillel Academy, a private school founded by the Jewish community, today is non-denominational but still serves as a meeting place for the children of the Jewish community. A Jamaican Jewish Heritage Center opened in 2006 in celebration of 350 years of Jews living in Jamaica. At least 21 Jewish cemeteries also exist in the country.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first successful breakout from Texan death row since Raymond Hamilton was broken out by Bonnie and Clyde on January 16, 1934.\n\nMartin Gurule was a Latino who was raised by his father and grandmother. His mother died shortly before his first birthday. He attended W. B. Ray High School in Corpus Christi and cared for intellectually disabled patients at Corpus Christi State School, an institution run by the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. His 23-year-old girlfriend, Malisa Smith, worked on the checkout at the U & I restaurant in Corpus Christi.\n\nOn October 12, 1992, Gurule entered U & I late at night and fatally shot restaurant co-owner Mike Piperis and employee Anthony Staton. Gurule claimed that Piperis had ordered him to come to the restaurant that night because Piperis wanted to discuss an accusation of Gurule committing tax evasion. Then, Gurule claimed, Piperis attacked him and Gurule used his firearm in self-defense.\n\nInvestigators contradicted Gurule's version of events. They alleged that Staton was sitting on a chair when he was shot in the back of the head. Piperis was found kneeling against a chair in front of an open safe, and had also been shot in the back of the head. It was also discovered that Gurule's girlfriend, Malisa Smith, had been fired from her job at the restaurant in the week before the killings. The prosecution alleged that Gurule and Smith had jointly planned to rob the restaurant. It was also noted that Gurule had convictions dating back to 1986 for credit card fraud, theft and two robberies. Nueces County District Attorney Carlos Valdéz called the killings a \"crime that had had been building up over several years\".\n\nIn July 1993, Martin Gurule was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death, while Smith was sentenced to 25 years in jail. Gurule was transferred to the Elis Unit in an unincorporated area of Walker County. It is the only unit in Texas that has death row for male inmates. Gurule was selected for the Work Capable Program, together with around 150 other death row inmates. This was a trial program that allowed selected death row inmates to move relatively freely outside their cells, to have contact with other non-death row inmates and to carry out supervised work within the prison. His appeal against the death penalty was denied a year before his escape.\n\nDuring a Thanksgiving dinner on November 26, 1998, Martin Gurule and six other death row inmates hid in a recreation room. Prior to leaving their cells for the dinner, they had placed cushions and sheets in their beds in such a way that the guards would not suspect anything was amiss. They also darkened their prison uniforms with marker pens so that they would be less visible at night. After the cells were locked for the night, they broke through a door to the recreational yard and then through a separating fence. Once they reached the main prison yard, they scaled the roof of a building and waited for complete darkness.\n\nShortly after midnight, guards at a post spotted the escapees climbing, immediately raising the alarm and opening fire. At this point, all six of Gurule's co-escapees surrendered, but Gurule ran approximately 100 ft over an open piece of land, scaled a barbed-wire fence, ran another 70 ft across a clearing, scaled a second barbed-wire fence and disappeared into the darkness outside the prison boundary, despite the guards firing 18 shots at him.\n\nMore than 500 officers from surrounding towns, cities and counties took part in the manhunt, which was supported by sniffer dogs, boats and helicopters. Governor George W. Bush additionally called in the Texas Rangers and announced a 5,000-dollar reward for information leading to Gurule's capture.\n\nSeven days later, two fishermen found Gurule's body in a tributary of the Trinity River near Huntsville. Gurule was wearing several layers of clothing and rolled up newspapers and cardboard to protect him while scaling the prison's barbed-wire fences. The autopsy revealed that he had sustained a gunshot in the back, causing him to drown in the river. His time of death was backdated to November 27, meaning that he died on the night of his escape. Investigators believe that he jumped into the river to remove traces that could allow sniffer dogs to locate him, and then drowned due to the severity of his gunshot wound preventing him from being able to get out of the river.\n\nAs a direct result of Gurule's escape, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice relocated its death row in March 1999 to the Terrell Unit (now renamed the Allan B. Polunsky Unit), in West Livingston, Polk County. The Work Capable Program was discontinued.\n\n"}

{"id": "320340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320340", "title": "Needle exchange programme", "text": "Needle exchange programme\n\nA needle and syringe programme (NSP), syringe-exchange programme (SEP), or needle exchange program (NEP) is a social service that allows injecting drug users (IDUs) to obtain hypodermic needles and associated paraphernalia at little or no cost. It is based on the philosophy of harm reduction that attempts to reduce the risk factors for diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. While NSPs provide most or all equipment free of charge, exchange programmes require service users to return used syringes to receive an equal number of new syringes.\n\nA comprehensive 2004 study by the World Health Organization (WHO) found a \"compelling case that NSPs substantially and cost effectively reduce the spread of HIV among IDUs and do so without evidence of exacerbating injecting drug use at either the individual or societal level.\" WHO's findings have also been supported by the American Medical Association (AMA), which in 2000 adopted a position strongly supporting NSPs when combined with addiction counseling.\n\nNeedle-exchange programmes can be traced back to informal activities undertaken during the 1970s. The idea is likely to have been rediscovered in multiple locations. The first government-approved initiative (Netherlands) was undertaken in the early to mid-1980s, followed closely by other initiatives. While the initial programme was motivated by an outbreak of hepatitis B, the AIDS pandemic motivated the rapid adoption of these programmes around the world.\n\nHarm reduction begins with the assumption that it is not reasonable to assume that individuals make healthy decisions. Advocates hold that those trapped in dangerous behaviors are often unable and/or unwilling to break free of them, and should at least be enabled to continue these behaviors in a less harmful manner. A tendency in the medical profession has been to treat drug dependency as a chronic illness like diabetes, hypertension and asthma, to be treated, evaluated and even insured in like manner. Treating drug dependency as an illness absolves drug users of responsibility for their condition.\n\nNEPs typically support the health and well-being of people who use drugs through awareness, education, and empowerment; for example, programs in Australia use the community development (CD) discipline as a basis for their work. NEPs treat recreational drug use as a health issue and neither condemn nor condone the practice. Some US states ordinarily require a prescription to buy needles and syringes, as they are considered drug paraphernalia rather than medical equipment. NEPs provide access in such areas.\n\nNational District Attorneys Association (NDAA)'s view is that denial of human agency offends common sense as well as criminal statutes, in that adults are responsible for their actions. Where individual decisions impact public health and welfare, criminal sanctions are appropriate and necessary. Catholic Church doctrine asserts that harm reduction protocols treat persons as objects not in control of their own actions and gives the impression that certain types of irresponsible behavior have no moral content.\nFormer US President George W. Bush wrote: \"Drug use in America, especially among children, increased dramatically under the Clinton-Gore Administration, and needle exchange programs signal nothing but abdication, that these dangers are here to stay. Children deserve a clear, unmixed message that there are right choices in life and wrong choices in life, that we are responsible for our actions, and that using drugs will destroy your life.\"\n\nIt is estimated that the average annual cost of HIV care per person in the United States is US$15,745. Those with advanced HIV had an annual estimated cost of US$40,678. Depending on when infection is detected and when the treatment process begins, it is estimated that, as of November 2006, the total lifetime healthcare costs of HIV care are between US$303,000 and $619,000.\n\n\nIn addition to sterile needles, syringe-exchange programmes typically offer services such as HIV and Hepatitis C testing; alcohol swabs; bleach water and normal saline (often as eye drops); aluminium \"cookers\"; citric acid powder (an imperative agent that enables heroin to dissolve in water); containers for needles and many other items. A survey conducted by Beth Israel Medical Center in New York city and the North American Syringe Exchange Network, among 126 surveyed SEPs that 77% provided material abuse therapy, 72% provided voluntary counselling and HIV testing, and more than two-thirds provided supplies such as bleach, alcohol pads and male and female condoms.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), around 1/5 of all new HIV infections and the vast majority of Hepatitis C infections are the result of injection drug use.\n\nNeedle-exchange programmes are supported by the CDC and the National Institute of Health. The NIH estimates that in the United States, between fifteen and twenty percent of injection drug users have HIV and at least seventy percent have hepatitis C.\n\nProponents of harm reduction argue that the provision of a needle exchange provides a social benefit in reducing health costs and also provides a safe means to dispose of used syringes. For example, in the United Kingdom, proponents of SEPs assert that, along with other programs, they have reduced the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users. These supposed benefits have led to an expansion of these programmes in most jurisdictions that have introduced them, increasing geographical coverage and operating hours. Vending machines that automatically dispense injecting equipment \"packs\" have been successfully introduced.\n\nAnother advantage cited by program supporters is that SEPs protect both users and their support network such as attenders, sexual partners, children or neighbours. SEPs can also have an indirect influence to control transmission risks. Nurses are important for spreading knowledge about HIV among users. These programmes provide physical protection from HIV and facilitate education by teaching users about blood-borne pathogens as well as how to protect themselves and others.\n\nOther promoted benefits of these programmes include providing a first point of contact for formal drug treatment, access to health and counselling service referrals, the provision of up-to-date information about safe injecting practices, access to contraception and sexual health services and providing a means for data collection from users about their behaviour and/or drug use patterns. SEP outlets in some settings offer basic primary health care. These are known as 'targeted primary health care outlets', because they primarily target people who inject drugs and/or 'low-threshold health care outlets', because they reduce common barriers to health care from the conventional health care outlets. Clients frequently visit SEP outlets for help accessing sterile injecting equipment. These visits are used opportunistically to offer other health care services.\n\nA clinical trial of needle exchange found that needle exchange did not cause an increase in drug injection. These findings were endorsed by then United States Surgeon General Davis Satcher, then Director of the National Institutes of Health Harold Varmus and then Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala.\n\nThese services can take on a wide range of configurations:\n\n\nCountries where these programmes exist include: Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Iran and the United States. In the United States such programmes may not receive federal funding, but this ban was briefly lifted in 2009 before being re-instated in 2010.\n\nThe Melbourne, Australia inner-city suburbs of Richmond and Abbotsford are locations in which the use and dealing of heroin has been concentrated. The Burnet Institute research organisation completed the 2013 'North Richmond Public Injecting Impact Study' in collaboration with the Yarra Drug and Health Forum and North Richmond Community Health Centre and recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment due to the ongoing \"widespread, frequent and highly visible\" nature of illicit drug use in the areas. Between 2010 and 2012 a four-fold increase in the levels of inappropriately discarded injecting equipment was documented for the two suburbs. In the surrounding City of Yarra, an average of 1,550 syringes per month were collected from public syringe disposal bins in 2012. Paul Dietze stated, \"We have tried different measures and the problem persists, so it's time to change our approach\".\n\nOn 28 May 2013, the Burnet Institute stated that it recommended 24-hour access to sterile injecting equipment in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray after the area's drug culture continued to grow after more than ten years of intense law enforcement efforts. The Institute's research concluded that public injecting behaviour is frequent in the area and injecting paraphernalia has been found in carparks, parks, footpaths and drives. Furthermore, people who inject drugs have broken into syringe disposal bins to reuse discarded equipment.\n\nThe British public body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), introduced a recommendation in April 2014 due to an increase in the number of young people who inject steroids at UK needle exchanges. NICE previously published needle exchange guidelines in 2009, in which needle and syringe services were not advised for people under 18, but the organisation's director Professor Mike Kelly explained that a \"completely different group\" of people were presenting at programs. In the updated guidance, NICE recommended the provision of specialist services for “rapidly increasing numbers of steroid users”, and that needles should be provided to people under the age of 18—a first for NICE—following reports of 15-year-old steroid injectors seeking to develop their muscles.\n\nAs of 2011, at least 221 programs operated in the US. Most (91%) were legally authorized to operate; 38.2% were managed by their local health authorities.\n\nMore than 36 million syringes were distributed annually, mostly through large urban programs operating a stationary site. More generally, US NEPs distribute syringes through a variety of methods including mobile vans, delivery services and backpack/pedestrian routes that include secondary (peer-to-peer) exchange. \"Estimates of the annual number of syringes required to meet the single-use standard run in the range of 1 billion.\"\n\nThe use of federal funds for needle-exchange programs was banned in 1988, but this ban was overturned in 2009. In the time before the federal funding ban was re-instated in 2011, at least three programs were able to obtain federal funds and two thirds reported planning to pursue such funding. A 1997 study estimated that while the funding ban was in effect, it \"may have led to HIV infection among thousands of IDUs, their sexual partners, and their children.\" US NEPs continue to be funded through a mixture of state and local government funds, supplemented by private donations. The funding ban was effectively lifted for every aspect of the exchanges except the needles themselves in the omnibus spending bill passed in December 2015 and signed by President Obama. This change was first suggested by Kentucky Republicans Hal Rogers and Mitch McConnell, according to their spokespeople.\n\nMany states criminalized needle possession without a prescription, arresting people as they left private needle exchange facilities. In jurisdictions where syringe-prescription status presented a legal barrier, physician-based prescription programs showed promise. Epidemiological research demonstrating that syringe access programs are both effective and cost-effective helped to change state and local NEP-operation laws, as well as the status of syringe possession more broadly. As of 2006, 48 states authorized needle exchange in some form or allowed the purchase of sterile syringes without a prescription at pharmacies.\n\nBy 2012, legal syringe exchange programs existed in at least 35 states. In some settings, syringe possession and purchase is decriminalized, while in others, authorized NEP clients are exempt from certain drug paraphernalia laws. However, despite the legal changes, gaps between the formal law and environment mean that many programs continue to face law enforcement interference and covert programs continue to exist within the U.S.\n\nColorado allows covert syringe exchange programs to operate. Current Colorado laws leave room for interpretation over the requirement of a prescription to purchase syringes. Based on such laws, the majority of pharmacies do not sell syringes without a prescription and police arrest people who possess syringes without a prescription. Volunteer-run groups such as The Works (Boulder) and The Underground Syringe Exchange of Denver (the USED) operate covertly to avoid prosecution and are entirely funded by donations. Due to the illegal nature of the organization, the USED website specifies that new clients must be referred in order to exchange syringes. According to The Works website, between January 2012 and March 2012, the group received over 45,000 dirty needles and distributed around 45,200 sterile syringes.\n\nRemoval of legal barriers to the operation of NEPs and other syringe access initiatives has been identified as an important part of a comprehensive approach to reducing HIV transmission among IDUs. Legal barriers include both \"law on the books\" and \"law on the streets,\" i.e., the actual practices of law enforcement officers, which may or may not reflect relevant law. Changes in syringe and drug control policy can be ineffective in reducing such barriers if police continue to treat syringe possession as a crime or participation in NEP as evidence of criminal activity.\n\nAlthough most US NEPs operate legally, many report some form of police interference. In a 2009 national survey of 111 US NEP managers, 43% reported at least monthly client harassment, 31% at least monthly unauthorized confiscation of clients’ syringes, 12% at least monthly client arrest en route to or from NEP and 26% uninvited police appearances at program sites at least every 6 months. In multivariate modeling, legal status of the program (operating legally vs illegally) and jurisdiction’s syringe regulation environment were not associated with frequency of police interference. This finding confirms a substantial gap between law and law enforcement.\n\nA detailed 2011 analysis of NEP client experiences in Los Angeles suggested that as many as 7% of clients report negative encounters with security officers in any given month. Given that syringes are not prohibited in the jurisdiction and their confiscation can only occur as part of an otherwise authorized arrest, almost 40% of those who reported syringe confiscation were not arrested. This raises concerns about extrajudicial confiscation of personal property. Approximately 25% of the encounters detailed by respondents involved private security personnel, rather than local police.\n\nSimilar findings have emerged internationally. For example, despite instituting laws protecting syringe access and possession and adopting NEPs, IDUs and sex workers in Mexico’s Northern Border regions report frequent syringe confiscation by law enforcement personnel. In this region as well as elsewhere, reports of syringe confiscation are correlated with increases in risky behaviors, such as groin injecting, public injection and utilization of pharmacies. These practices translate to risk for HIV and other blood-borne diseases.\n\nNEPs serving predominantly IDUs of color may be almost 4 times more likely to report frequent client arrest en route to or from the program and almost 4 times more likely to report unauthorized syringe confiscation. A 2005 study in Philadelphia found that African-Americans accessing the city's legally operated exchange decreased at more than twice the rate of white individuals after the initiation of a police anti-drug operation. These and other findings illustrate a possible mechanism by which racial disparities in law enforcement can translate into disparities in HIV transmission. Notably, the majority (56%) of respondents reported not documenting adverse police events; those who did were 2.92 times more likely to report unauthorized syringe confiscation. These findings suggest that systematic surveillance and interventions are needed to address police interference.\n\nPolice interference with legal NEP operations may be partially explained by training defects. A study of police officers in an urban police department four years after the decriminalization of syringe purchase and possession in the US state of Rhode Island suggested that up to a third of police officers were not aware that the law had changed. This knowledge gap parallels other areas of public health law, underscoring pervasive gaps in dissemination.\n\nEven police officers with accurate knowledge of the law, however, reported intention to confiscate syringes from drug users as a way to address problematic substance abuse. Police also reported anxiety about accidental needle sticks and acquiring communicable diseases from IDUs, but were not trained or equipped to deal with this occupational risk; this anxiety was intertwined with negative attitudes towards syringe access initiatives.\n\nUS NEPs have successfully trained police, especially when framed as addressing police occupational safety and human resources concerns. Preliminary evidence also suggests that training can shift police knowledge and attitudes regarding NEPs specifically and public health-based approaches towards problematic drug use in general.\n\nAccording to a 2011 survey, 20% of US NEPs reported training police during the previous year. Covered topics included the public health rationale behind NEPs (71%), police occupational health (67%), needle stick injury (62%), NEPs’ legal status (57%), and harm reduction philosophy (67%). On average, training was seen as moderately effective, but only four programs reported conducting any formal evaluation. Assistance with training police was identified by 72% of respondents as the key to improving police relations.\n\nOrganizations ranging from the NIH, CDC, the American Bar Association, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the World Health Organization and many others endorsed low-threshold programs including needle exchange.\n\nNeedle exchange programs have faced opposition on both political and moral grounds. Advocacy groups including the National District Attorneys Association (NDAA), Drug Watch International, The Heritage Foundation, Drug Free Australia, and so forth, religious organizations such as the Catholic Church, and many individuals in important policy-making positions have united to oppose these programs.\n\nIn the United States NEP programs have proliferated, despite lack of public acceptance. Internationally, needle exchange is widely accepted.\n\nNeedle exchanges have achieved acceptance by some churches and other religious groups, as the House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Presbyterian Church and the Society of Christian Ethics.\n\nTwo 2010 ‘reviews of reviews’ by a team originally led by Norah Palmateer that examined systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the topic found insufficient evidence that NSP prevents transmission of the Hepatitis C virus, tentative evidence that it prevents transmission of HIV, and sufficient evidence that it reduces self-reported risky injecting behaviour. In a comment Palmateer warned politicians not to use her team's review of reviews as a justification to close existing programs or to hinder the introduction of new needle-exchange schemes. The weak evidence on the programs' disease prevention effectiveness is due to inherent design limitations of the reviewed primary studies and should not be interpreted as the programs lacking preventive effects.\n\nThe second of the Palmateer team's 'review of reviews' scrutinised 10 previous formal reviews of needle exchange studies, and after critical appraisal only four reviews were considered rigorous enough to meet the inclusion criteria. Those were done by the teams of Gibson (2001), Wodak and Cooney (2004), Tilson (2007) and Käll (2007). The Palmateer team judged that their conclusion in favour of NSP effectiveness was not consistent with the results from the HIV studies they reviewed.\n\nThe Wodak and Cooney review had, from 11 studies of what they determined as demonstrating acceptable rigour, found 6 that were positive regarding the effectiveness of NSPs in preventing HIV, 3 that were negative and 2 inconclusive. However a review by Käll \"et al.\" disagreed with the Wodak and Cooney review, reclassifying the studies on NSP effectiveness to 3 positive, 3 negative and 5 inconclusive. The US Institute of Medicine evaluated the conflicting evidence of both Drs Wodak and Käll in their Geneva session and concluded that although multicomponent HIV prevention programs that include needle and syringe exchange reduced intermediate HIV risk behavior, evidence regarding the effect of needle and syringe exchange alone on HIV incidence was limited and inconclusive, given \"myriad design and methodological issues noted in the majority of studies.\" Four studies that associated needle exchange with reduced HIV prevalence failed to establish a causal link, because they were designed as population studies rather than assessing individuals.<br>\nNEPs successfully serve as one component of HIV prevention strategies. Multi-component HIV prevention programs that include NSE reduce drug-related HIV risk behaviors and enhance the impact of harm reduction services.\n\nTilson (2007) concluded that only comprehensive packages of services in multi-component prevention programs can be effective in reducing drug-related HIV risks. In such packages, it is unclear what the relative contribution of needle exchange may be to reductions in risk behavior and HIV incidence.\n\nMultiple examples can be cited showing the relative ineffectiveness of needle exchange programs alone in stopping the spread of blood-borne disease. Many needle exchange programs do not make any serious effort to treat drug addiction. For example, David Noffs of the Life Education Center wrote, \"I have visited sites around Chicago where people who request info on quitting their habit are given a single sheet on how to go cold turkey -- hardly effective treatment or counseling.\"\n\nA 2013 systematic review found support for the use of NEPs to prevent and treat HIV and HCV infection. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found evidence that NEPs were effective in reducing HIV transmission among injection drug users, but that other harm reduction programs have probably also contributed to the decrease in HIV incidence. NEPs appear to be as effective in low- and middle-income countries as in high-income ones.\n\nLemon and Shah presented a 2013 paper at the International Congress of Psychiatrists that highlighted lack of training for needle exchange workers and also showed the workers performing a range of tasks beyond contractual obligations, for which they had little support or training. It also showed how needle exchange workers were a common first contact for distressed drug users. Perhaps the most concerning finding was that workers were not legally allowed to provide Naloxone should it be needed.\n\n\n\nAs of 2011, CDC estimated that every HIV infection prevented through a needle exchange program saves an estimated US$178,000+. Separately it reported an overall 30 percent or more reduction in HIV cases among IDUs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42051454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42051454", "title": "Night Wolves", "text": "Night Wolves\n\nThe Night Wolves () are a Russian motorcycle club.\n\nThe club began forming out of a mixture of rock music fans and motorcycle enthusiasts who held then-illegal rock concerts in Moscow (see Censorship in the Soviet Union) as far back as 1983. By 1989 the club was consolidated as an informal motorcycle group bearing the name \"Night Wolves\", during the Perestroika era of the Soviet Union. It became the first official bike club in the USSR. As of the beginning of 2018, the Night Wolves now have chapters in Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Australia, Slovakia, Belarus, Philippines, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Czech Republic and Macedonia. Alexander Zaldostanov (also known as The Surgeon) became the leader of the club in 1989.\n\nThe club runs multiple rock clubs and arranges many rock concerts in Russia. It also runs several tattoo parlors and is one of the founders of the annual International Moscow Tattoo Convention. In 1995, they launched a clothing line, \"Wolf Wear,\" and established the \"Wolf Engineering\" custom shop subsidiary. It has gathered mechanics and general motorcycle enthusiasts from all across Russia, runs several motorcycle repair and custom shops and also developed the Wolf-Ural (Волк-Урал) motorcycle together with the manufacturer IMZ-Ural. They usually ride Harley-Davidsons. Another subsidiary is the racing team \"Wolf Racing\" which was created in 2001 and participates in and organizes various events in Russia.\n\nA member of the Night Wolves, Valery Bely, was shot and killed in a dispute with a rival biker club, Three Roads, in November 2012. The head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, joined the group in August 2014. In May 2015, Zaldostanov inaugurated the group's Chechen branch in Grozny and named Kadyrov its honorary leader.\n\nThe Night Wolves set up a compound in Slovakia near Bratislava, not far from the Czech border, housing old tanks and armored vehicles.\n\nThe club has long taken an interest in the political and social life of Russia, engaging in youth social issues, forging close links to the Kremlin and establishing a friendship with President Putin. They also contributed to the breaking away of Crimea by patrolling the streets of the peninsula with unmarked soldiers sent from Russia and fought for the pro-Russian side in the Donbass war. They are involved with the Russian Orthodox Church and make a motorcycle pilgrimage to holy Russian Orthodox sites several times a year.\n\nThe club has close ties to Vladimir Putin and a generally Russian nationalist sentiment. Putin has described them as his \"friends\" and appeared at their rallies, riding a Harley-Davidson trike. Yale University historian Timothy Snyder believes it serves \"as a paramilitary and propaganda arm of the Putin regime.\"\n\nThe Night Wolves are funded by the Kremlin, receiving \"several hundred million rubles a year\" according to a report in 2013. In May 2015, Alexei Navalny claimed that the Russian government had given 56 million rubles to the group in the preceding year and a half. In October 2015, Night Wolves received a donation of 12,000,000 rubles from the Russian government to 'build a \"Patriot\" youth center in Sevastopol in Crimea'.\n\nMembers of the Night Wolves have fought on the side of pro-Russian militants during the Crimean Crisis and war in Donbass. They blockaded the main routes into Sevastopol and participated in attacks on a natural gas facility and the naval headquarters in the city. In April 2015, Agence France-Presse stated that Alexei Vereshchyagin had fought against Ukrainian government forces in Luhansk.\n\nTheir August 2014 show in Sevastopol, supporting the annexation of Crimea by Russia and depicting Ukraine as a country controlled by \"fascists\", was attended by an estimated 100,000 people and broadcast by Russian state television.\n\nDuring their New Year's shows for children, the Night Wolves portrayed the West as conspiring to destroy Russia. In a January 2015 interview with \"RIA Novosti\", Zaldostanov stated that \"When the kids come to us, we don't cut costs on special effects or efforts to convey to the children a feeling of true drive and danger.\"\n\nCanada added Zaldostanov to its sanctions list in February 2015. The Night Wolves were included in June 2015.\n\nIn 2015, when the Night Wolves were planning to celebrate the \"Victory Day\" — victory over the Nazi Germany in the \"Great Patriotic War\" — on May 9 with a trip from Moscow to Berlin, the government of Poland refused them entry due to the club members' active support of Putin, and Germany cancelled the bikers' Schengen visas. On their way to Berlin, despite visa issues, Night Wolves commemorated the deaths of Polish officers murdered by NKVD in Katyn by lighting candles in their name on 26 April, although Night Wolves and their leader are outspoken supporters of Joseph Stalin, who ordered the murders.\n\nA Polish motocyclists' organization calling itself the \"Katyń Motocycle Raid\" (KMR) criticized the ban and said that Night Wolves already made two such trips in the past, and Polish public opinion was divided on the decision, with 38.7% supporting it and 28.5% opposing. After the ban, the KMR declared that it would light candles on the graves of fallen Red Army soldiers in the name of the Night Wolves. Families of the Katyń massacre's victims stated that they did not wish to be associated with the KMR.\n\nBikers who wanted to enter Germany at the Berlin Schönefeld International Airport were denied entry. On 6 May, one member, who was trying to enter Germany by ship from Helsinki to Travemünde, was deported to Finland.\n\nIn December 2014, the United States announced sanctions against the Night Wolves due to their involvement in attacks on a gas distribution station in Strikolkove and the Ukrainian naval headquarters in Sevastopol, and recruitment of fighters for the war in Donbass.\n\nAccording to Peter Pomerantsev, the Night Wolves admire Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator and one of the three main Allied leaders of World War II. On their ride to Berlin for a rally marking the anniversary of the end of World War II in 2015, they displayed red flags with portraits of Stalin and shouted World War II-era Red Army oath \"For the Motherland! For Stalin!\" According to Alexei Magister, the president of a biker club linked to the Night Wolves, \" We are not harming anyone, we are just honouring the memory of those who fell to destroy Fascism\".\n\nOn their ride to Berlin in 2015, the Night Wolves paid homage at the Russia's memorial to Polish prisoners of war killed in the Katyn massacre by the NKVD on Stalin's and Beria's orders in 1940.\n\nIn January 2015, the group's leader, the Ukraine-born Alexander Zaldostanov, expressed support for a Russian Anti-Maidan movement which said it was ready to use violence to stop anti-government protesters.\n\nIn an interview, Zaldostanov said \"For the first time we showed resistance to the global Satanism, the growing savagery of Western Europe, the rush to consumerism that denies all spirituality, the destruction of traditional values, all this homosexual talk, this American democracy.\"\nAndrei Bobrovsky, the leader of the Night Wolves ride from Moscow to Berlin, told \"Sputnik\" (the Russian government-controlled news agency) in May 2016, \"The Slovaks received us very well. It seems that we [Russians] and them [Slovaks] are soul mates. We're not only Slavs, but we're also very similar in the way we think.\"\n\nIn an interview with Finnish journalist Juha Portaankorva in 2016, Zaldostanov said \"I would love Finland to stay a good neighbor of Russia. I would love the Finns to trust Russia more than America.\"\n\nIn January 2015, Zaldostanov suggested that \"Death to faggots\" could be an alternate name for the Russian anti-Maidan movement. At a February 2015 \"Anti-Maidan\" rally in Moscow organized by Zaldostanov, popular slogans included \"We don't need Western ideology and gay parades!\"\n\nAccording to some of the Night Wolves, a prospective member must be male, from a former Soviet country, invited by an existing member, and must participate in club events for two years before becoming a member.\n\nThe Night Wolves claim not to discriminate on religious grounds. The Night Wolves are openly homophobic and do not allow gay men to join the club; women are also not allowed to join.\n\nThe Night Wolves have over 7000 members, including Ramzan Kadyrov, the Head of the Chechen Republic.\n\nThere is a Night Wolves Macedonia.\n\nIn the very beginning. the Night Wolves were often in conflict with other biking clubs. Yevgeny Vorobyev, the leader of the Three Roads, accused them of becoming too politicised. But since the club openly rejected the 1%'er status and has shown other motorcycle clubs they are nothing like the true 1% outlaw gangs that more often than not hold deep criminal ties, the Night Wolves have gained worldwide respect and support from other biker clubs.

The proximity of Nupe to the Yoruba Igbomina people in the south and to the Yoruba Oyo people in the southwest led to cross-fertilization of cultural influences through trade and conflicts over the centuries. It is said that the famous Yoruba oba or king, Shango (also known as Jakuta) who was once an Alaafin of Oyo before being deified following his death, was the son of a Nupe (Tapa) woman.\n\nMany Nupe were converted to Islam at the end of the eighteenth century by Mallam Dendo, a wandering preacher, and were incorporated into the Fulani Empire established by the Jihad led by Usman dan Fodio after 1806.\n\nHowever, the traditions of Nupe were retained, hence the ruler of Nupe is the Etsu Nupe rather than being called Emir. The city of Bida fell to the colonialist British forces in 1897, the Etsu Abubakar was deposed and replaced by the more pliable Muhammadu (Vandeleur 1898). During the reign of Muhammadu, a Prince named Jimada moved to Patigi, northeast of Bida (not to be confused with near-identically spelt Pategi, southwest of Bida, on the southern and opposite bank of the Niger River) protesting against being ruled by a Fulani (Vandeleur 1898). Now Jimada’s descendants are fighting for the post of Etsu Nupe claiming to be the only existing pure Nupe ruling family.\nThe present Etsu Nupe is Yahaya Abubakar.\n\nMore detail on the history of the Nupe kingdoms can be found in Burdon (1909), Nadel (1942), Hogben & Kirk-Greene (1966:261-282) and Mason (1981).\n\nThere are probably about 3.5 million Nupes, principally in Niger State, although a small but growing diaspora of Nupe can be found in Knowle in the West Midlands of England. The Nupe language is also spoken in Kwara and Kogi States. They are primarily Muslims, with a few Christians and followers of African Traditional Religion. The Nupe people have several local, traditional rulers. The Etsu Nupe (Bida) is not Nupe and is actually part of the Fula tribe but they came to rule the Bida in the 1806. They have no present capital, although they were originally based at Rabah and only moved to Bida in the nineteenth century.\n\nThe Nupe people have various traditions. Much of their culture was diluted by the Usman Dan Fodio jihad of the 19th century, but they still hold on to some of their culture which is very similar to that of ancient Egypt. Many Nupe people often have tribal scars on their faces (similar to an old Yoruba tradition), some to identify their prestige and the family of which they belong as well as for protection, as well as jewelry adornment. But these traditions are dying out in certain areas.\nTheir art is often abstract. They are well known for their wooden stools with patterns carved onto the surface.\n\nThe Nupe were described in detail by the ethnographer Siegfried Nadel, whose book, \"Black Byzantium\", remains an anthropological classic.\n\n"}

{"id": "509190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=509190", "title": "Public Opinion (book)", "text": "Public Opinion (book)\n\nPublic Opinion is a book by Walter Lippmann, published in 1922. It is a critical assessment of functional democratic government, especially of the irrational and often self-serving social perceptions that influence individual behavior and prevent optimal societal cohesion. The detailed descriptions of the cognitive limitations people face in comprehending their sociopolitical and cultural environments, leading them to apply an evolving catalogue of general stereotypes to a complex reality, rendered \"Public Opinion\" a seminal text in the fields of media studies, political science, and social psychology.\n\nThe introduction describes man's inability to interpret the world: \"The real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance\" between people and their environment. People construct a pseudo-environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged mental image of the world, and to a degree, everyone's pseudo-environment is a fiction. People \"live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones.\"\n\nHuman behavior is stimulated by the person's pseudo-environment and then is acted upon in the real world. Some of the general implications of the interactions among one's psychology, environment, and the mass communications media are highlighted.\n\nBy definition, pertinent facts are never provided completely and accurately; by necessity they are arranged to portray a certain, subjective interpretation of an event. Those who are most familiar with the greatest amount of facts regarding a certain environment, construct a pseudo-environment that aligns with their own 'stereotypes' and convey this to the public, knowingly or not, to suit their own private needs. This is inescapable human nature. Propaganda is inherently impossible without a barrier of censorship between the event and the public. As a consequence, the mass communication media, by their very nature as vehicles for informational transmission, are essentially vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nThe blame for that perceptual parallax falls not upon the mass media technology (print, radio, cinema, or, inferentially, television) or logistical concerns but upon certain members of society who attend to life with little intellectual engagement. That causes the following:\n\n\nWhen properly deployed in the public interest, the manufacture of consent is useful and necessary for a cohesive society, because, in many cases, \"the common interests\" of the public are not obvious except upon careful analysis of the collected data, a critical intellectual exercise in which most people are uninterested or are incapable of doing. Therefore, most people must have the world summarized for them by the well-informed, and will then act accordingly.\n\nThe political élite are members of the class of people who are incapable of accurately understanding, by themselves, the complex \"unseen environment\" wherein the public affairs of the modern state occur; thus, Lippmann proposes that a professional, \"specialized class\" collect and analyze data, and present their conclusions to the society's decision makers, who, in their turn, use the \"art of persuasion\" to inform the public about the decisions and circumstances affecting them.\n\n\"Public Opinion\" proposes that the increased power of propaganda and the specialized knowledge required for effective political decisions have rendered the traditional notion of democracy impossible. The phrase \"manufacture of consent\" was introduced, which the public intellectuals Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman used as the title of their book \"\" (1988).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31596356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31596356", "title": "Social division of labor", "text": "Social division of labor\n\nSocial division of labor, one of the two aspects of the division of labor, is the social structural foundation of the specialized commodity production divided between industries, firms, and occupations of workers, or the \"technical\" division of tasks. Prior to centralized manufacturing, individuals specialized in the production of one product, trading their final product for final products made by other individuals. This can refer to specialized trades within a community, such as master sewers, blacksmiths, farmers, etc., or also the specializations of whole communities in contact with each other, such as one community making clothes, one making tools, and another producing food, which they exchange. Social division of labor greatly increases productivity, because individuals can produce the product in which they have a comparative advantage, and trade it to the individuals who cannot efficiently produce it for the products they need. The social division of labor creates exchange market and prices, by comparing the cost and time of making each product.\n\nSocial division of labor can be advantageous; however, too much specialization can be disadvantageous due to three main reasons. If a community specializes on a product too much, the community will become dependent on the success of their product and will endure an economic disaster if their product becomes replaced or goes extinct. For example, if bananas go extinct or grow under bad seasonal conditions in a country such as Ecuador, the economy will suffer along with the whole community. Another case in which too much specialization could backfire is if all communities relied on one community to produce a certain product, because then the community would have a monopoly on that product and would have the ability to withhold production for their own greater benefit. A final problem is that individual workers who specialize in highly specific occupational skill-sets are vulnerable to economic reorganization associated with volatile 'product cycles' and developments of new industries where representation in union constituencies may change (e.g., financial services) over older, outsourced or automated ones (e.g., weaving). Marxists argue that capitalism, and modes of production in general, change through revolutions in the means of production, which produce unemployed workers over-specializing in niche occupations, and hence, cannot enter the labour force to solve spiraling unemployment problems when these disappear.\n\n"}

{"id": "38489101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38489101", "title": "South Asian people in Ireland", "text": "South Asian people in Ireland\n\nSouth Asian people in Ireland are residents or citizens of Ireland who are of South Asian background or ancestry. There has been an important and well-established community of people of South Asian descent in Ireland for many decades. Non-Chinese Asian people (the category which mainly includes South Asian people) were reported to be the fastest growing ethnic group in Ireland in the 2011 census. Some of these people self-identify as being fully Irish, while others prefer to identify with their original country of ancestry.\n\nThere is great variation in how much the South Asian people are integrated into Irish society. Many people of South Asian descent are well-integrated and embrace the culture of Ireland. Many children of South Asian descent are born in Ireland or have come to Ireland at a very young age, and therefore learn the Irish language in schools (which is compulsory to children who have been living in the country before the age of 7). There are South Asian people who are up to 2nd and 3rd generation Irish-born. However, many South Asian people still maintain their ancestral customs and languages, and therefore many religious festivals (such as Diwali) are well-known and accepted within Ireland.\n\nAs the Irish government does not collect detailed data on ethnicity in Ireland, population estimates vary, and non-Chinese Asian people are generally grouped in one category rather than groups based on people from individual South Asian countries. Estimates say that people of South Asian ethnicity make up around 1 to 3% of Ireland's population. The Irish-India Council estimates that there are approximately 91,520 Indian-born people in Ireland.\n\nSome of the first South Asians to settle in Ireland came as doctors in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Ireland has long had a shortage of doctors and nurses, partially due to the emigration of native doctors, and therefore hires many foreign medical staff. Most of the foreign medical staff come from India and Pakistan. This is probably due to the large numbers of medical graduates in those countries who are attracted to Ireland by its use of the English language, living standards, salaries, opportunities and new lives in Europe and the Western world.\n\nWhile South Asian doctors continue to come to Ireland, over the recent years (especially during the Celtic Tiger, a period of major economic boom in Ireland), a significant number of other non-medical South Asians have come to live in Ireland, seeking labour, opportunities, better standards of living and money to support their families at home. These people may be skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled and have varying knowledge of the English language. Thousands of South Asians work in construction, business, industry, pharmaceuticals, e-commerce, management and education in Ireland. There are hundreds of Indian restaurants and Kebab shops that are entirely South Asian-owned and run in nearly all of Ireland's major urban centres.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest within students from South Asian countries or South Asian background to undertake third level education in Ireland. Some of these students decide to stay on and work in Ireland after they graduate. Many of Ireland's major third level institutions, most notably Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin City University, Dublin Institute of Technology, National University of Ireland, Galway and National College of Ireland have a substantial number of students of South Asian descent. The Irish government wants to double the number of overseas students in Irish universities by 2015, and has shortlisted India as one of the key areas for bringing in foreign students.\n\nMany of the South Asian people that come to Ireland do not come directly from their South Asian countries and instead from other countries such as South Africa, the United Kingdom or the United States.\n\nThese figures are based on the 2011 census figures. As the Irish government does not take detailed statistics based on race and ethnicity, these figures may not be exactly accurate and should therefore only be taken as an indicator.\n\nThis table gives a brief indication of the religions followed by the people of South Asian descent in Ireland. These were the figures from the 2011 census. There are numerous Islamic centres and mosques and many Hindu temples in Ireland, although as with most Irish the most-confessed faith by South Asians is Catholicism.\n\nSouth Asians are diverse in their cultures and speak different languages as well. Many South Asian people are well-integrated into Irish society and embrace the culture of Ireland. However, the presence of South Asian people in Ireland has noticeably affected many aspects of Irish life. Festivals such as Diwali and Eid al-Fitr are celebrated every year in Ireland by South Asian people and native Irish people alike. There are many different organisations in Ireland that promote South Asian events in Ireland.\n\nEvery year, there is a large Diwali celebration in Dublin, with fireworks demonstrations, performances from well-known Indian musicians, traditional dancing from different parts of India, art, children's activities and a wide range of Indian cuisine and merchandising stalls selling traditional jewellery, clothing, Henna, etc. The use of fireworks are generally restricted in Ireland, but the government makes an exception due to the importance of the festival to the Hindu people. There are also such gatherings during the festival of Holi. The Ireland India Council, a voluntary council made to serve the needs and business relations of the Indian people in Ireland, organises many events and gatherings on a regular basis.\n\nSome South Asians have also been influenced by parts of Irish culture. For example, every year in Ireland many South Asian people participate in the annual St Patrick's Day parades throughout the country. The Sligo parade is one example that has regular participation from the local Riverstown Cricket Club, mainly represented by people of Pakistani origin. In Dublin, Indian people are known to have regular involvement. Also, there is a huge interest in Indian cuisine within Ireland. There are many Indian restaurants in Ireland, some are even being set up run by native Irish people.\n\nSouth Asians have also influenced sport in Ireland. There are numerous cricket clubs throughout the country that are run by South Asians or have large South Asian involvement and participation. One example is Riverstown Cricket Club in Sligo. This club also promotes cultural events such as parties for Eid-ul-Fittr.\n\nThere have been very few cases of problems experienced by the South Asian people in Ireland, and in general the South Asian people live happily alongside the native Irish population. However, a few known cases are noted here.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, there was an increase of attacks against Sikhs, in response many Irish Sikhs decided to remove their turbans and cut their hair as they were being mistaken for being Muslim.\n\nThe most prominent case is the death of Savita Halappanavar, a woman of Indian origin from Galway, who died aged 27 after being refused an abortion. She was reportedly refused abortion because of the fact that Ireland is \"a Catholic country\". This led to protests outside the Irish embassies in New Delhi, London, Berlin and Brussels, as well as protests from local communities in Ireland. The Indian Minister for External Affairs, Salman Khurshid, summoned the Indian ambassador to Ireland, Debashish Chakravarti, to India for deliberations over the issue.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20900142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20900142", "title": "Stereotypes of Jews", "text": "Stereotypes of Jews\n\nStereotypes of Jews are generalized representations of Jews, often caricatured and of a prejudiced and antisemitic nature. The Jewish diaspora have been stereotyped for over 2,000 years as scapegoats for a multitude of societal problems such as: Jews always acting with unforgiving hostility towards the Christians, Jews religious rituals thought to have specifically undermined the church and state, and Jews' habitual assassinations of Christians as their most extreme deeds. Antisemitism continued throughout the centuries and reached a climax in the Third Reich during World War II. Modern day Jews are still stereotyped as greedy, nit-picky, stingy misers and are often depicted in caricatures, comics, and propaganda posters counting money or collecting diamonds. Early films such as \"Cohen's Advertising Scheme\" (1904, silent) stereotyped Jews as \"scheming merchants\".\n\nCommon objects, phrases and traditions used to emphasize or ridicule Jewishness include bagels, playing violin, klezmer, undergoing circumcision, \"kvetching\", haggling and uttering various Yiddish phrases like \"mazel tov\", \"shalom\", and \"oy vey\". Other Jewish stereotypes are the rabbi, the complaining and guilt-inflicting Jewish mother, often along with a meek and nerdy nice Jewish boy, and the spoiled and materialistic Jewish-American princess.\nIn caricatures and cartoons, Jews are usually depicted as having large hook-noses, dark beady eyes with drooping eyelids. Exaggerated or grotesque Jewish facial features were a staple theme in Nazi propaganda and, less frequently, in Soviet propaganda. The \"Star Wars\" character Watto has been likened to traditional antisemitic caricatures.\n\nThe idea of the large or aquiline \"Jewish nose\" remains one of the most prevalent and defining features to characterize someone as a Jew. This widespread stereotype can be traced back to the 13th century, according to art historian Sara Lipton. While the depiction of the hooked-nose originated in the 13th century, it had an uprooting in European imagery many centuries later. The earliest record of anti-Jewish caricature is a detailed doodle depicted in the upper margin of the Exchequer Receipt Roll (English royal tax record) in 1233. It shows three demented looking Jews inside a castle as well as a Jew in the middle of the castle with a large nose. The fictional character Jew Süss resorted to rhinoplasty in an attempt to conceal his Jewishness, and the literary work \"The Operated Jew\" revolves around a similar plot of cosmetic surgery as a \"cure\" for Jewishness.\n\nIn European culture, prior to the 20th century, red hair was commonly identified as the distinguishing negative Jewish trait. This stereotype probably originated because red hair is a recessive trait that tends to find higher expression in highly endogamous populations, such as in Jewish communities where Jews were forbidden from marrying outsiders. Red hair was especially closely linked with Judas Iscariot, who was commonly shown with red hair to identify him as Jewish. During the Spanish Inquisition, all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews. Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair. In Medieval European lore, \"Red Jews\" were a semi-fictional group of red-haired Jews, although this tale has obscure origins.\n\nIn part due to their Middle Eastern ethnic origins, Jews tend to be portrayed as swarthy and hairy, sometimes associated with a curly hair texture known as a \"Jewfro\". There is a brown, edible woodland fungus, \"Auricularia cornea\", commonly referred to as \"Hairy Jew's ear\".\n\nJews have often been stereotyped as greedy and miserly. This originates in the Middle Ages, when the Church forbade Christians to lend money while charging interest (a practice called usury, although the word later took on the meaning of charging excessive interest). Jews were legally restricted to occupations as usurers, usually to Christians, and thus many went into money-lending. This led to, through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the association of Jews with greedy practices.\nPublications like \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" and literature such as William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\" and Charles Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\" reinforced the stereotype of the crooked Jew. Dickens later expressed regret for his portrayal of Fagin in the novel, and toned down references to his Jewishness. Furthermore, the character of Mr. Riah in his later novel \"Our Mutual Friend\" is a kindly Jewish creditor, and may have been created as an apology for Fagin. Lesser references in \"Arabian Nights\", \"The Three Musketeers\", and even \"Hans Brinker\" are examples of the prevalence of this negative perception.\nSome, such as Paul Volcker, suggest that the stereotype has decreased in prevalence in the United States. A telephone poll of 1747 American adults conducted by the Anti-Defamation League in 2009 found that 18% believed that \"Jews have too much power in the business world\", 13% that \"Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get what they want\", and 12% that \"Jews are not just as honest as other businesspeople\".\n\nJewish frugality, thriftiness, and greed are among the typical themes in jokes about Jews, even by Jews themselves.\n\nA common stereotype is that the Jews answer a question with a question. It is used in Jewish humor and in ordinary literature when it is required to paint a character as a \"typical Jew\".\n\nNegative stereotypes of Jewish women can appear in popular culture.\nStereotypes of Jewish mothers and Jewish-American Princesses are well-known and pervasive stereotypes of Jewish women.\n\nLa belle juive (the beautiful Jewess) was a 19th-century literary stereotype. A figure that is often associated with having and causing sexual lust, temptation and sin. Her personality traits could be portrayed either positively or negatively. The typical appearance of the belle juive included long, thick, dark hair, large dark eyes, an olive skin tone, and a languid expression. An example of this stereotype is Rebecca in Sir Walter Scott's \"Ivanhoe\". Another example is Miriam in Nathaniel Hawthorne's romance \"The Marble Faun\".\n\nThe Jewish mother or Jewish wife stereotype is a common stereotype and stock character used by Jewish and non-Jewish comedians, television and film writers, actors, and authors in the United States. The stereotype generally involves a nagging, loud, highly-talkative, overprotective, smothering, and overbearing mother or wife, who persists in interfering in her children's lives long after they have become adults and who is excellent at making her children feel guilty for actions that may have caused her to suffer. The Jewish mother stereotype can also involve a loving and overly proud mother who is highly defensive about her children in front of others. Like Italian mother stereotypes, Jewish mother characters are often shown cooking for the family, urging loved ones to eat more, and taking great pride in their food. Feeding a loved one is characterized as an extension of the desire to mother those around her. Lisa Aronson Fontes describes the stereotype as one of \"endless caretaking and boundless self-sacrifice\" by a mother who demonstrates her love by \"constant overfeeding and unremitting solicitude about every aspect of her children's and husband's welfare[s]\".\n\nA possible origin of this stereotype is anthropologist Margaret Mead's research into the European shtetl, financed by the American Jewish Committee. Although her interviews at Columbia University, with 128 European-born Jews, disclosed a wide variety of family structures and experiences, the publications resulting from this study and the many citations in the popular media resulted in the Jewish mother stereotype: a woman intensely loving but controlling to the point of smothering and attempting to engender enormous guilt in her children via the endless suffering she professes to have experienced on their behalf. The Jewish mother stereotype, then, has origins in the American Jewish community, with predecessors coming from Eastern European ghettos. In Israel, with its diversity of diasporic backgrounds and where most mothers are Jewish, the same stereotypical mother is known as the Polish mother (\"ima polania\").\n\nComedian Jackie Mason describes stereotypical Jewish mothers as parents who have become so expert in the art of needling their children that they have honorary degrees in \"Jewish Acupuncture\". Rappoport observes that jokes about the stereotype have less basis in anti-Semitism than they have in gender stereotyping. Helmreich agrees, observing that the attributes of a Jewish mother—overprotection, pushiness, aggression, and guilt-inducement—could equally well be ascribed to mothers of other ethnicities, from Italians through Blacks to Puerto Ricans.\n\nThe association of this otherwise \"gender\" stereotype with Jewish mothers in particular, is, according to Helmreich, because of the importance that is traditionally placed by Judaism on the home and the family, and on the role of the mother within that family. Judaism, as exemplified by the Bible (e.g. the Woman of Valor) and elsewhere, ennobles motherhood, and associates mothers with virtue. This ennoblement was further increased by poverty and hardship of Eastern European Jews immigrating into the United States (during the period 1881–1924, when one of the largest waves of such immigration occurred), where the requirements of hard work by the parents were passed on to children via guilt: \"We work so hard so that \"you\" can be happy.\" Other aspects of the stereotype are rooted in those immigrant Jewish parents' drive for their children to succeed, resulting in a push for perfection and a continual dissatisfaction with anything less: \"So you got a B? That could have been an A there.\" Hartman observes that the root of the stereotype is in the self-sacrifice of first-generation immigrants, unable to take full advantage of American education themselves, and the consequent transference of their aspirations, to success and social status, from themselves to their children. A Jewish mother obtains vicarious social status from the achievements of her children, where she is unable to achieve such status herself.\n\nOne of the earliest Jewish mother figures in American popular culture was Molly Goldberg, portrayed by Gertrude Berg, in the situation comedy \"The Goldbergs\" on radio from 1929 to 1949 and television from 1949 to 1955. But the stereotype as it came to be understood in the 20th century was exemplified by other literary figures. These include Rose Morgenstern from Herman Wouk's 1955 novel \"Marjorie Morningstar\", Mrs Patimkin from \"Goodbye, Columbus\" by Philip Roth, and Sophie Ginsky Portnoy from \"Portnoy's Complaint\" also by Roth. Sylvia Barack Fishman's characterization of Marjorie Morningstar and Sophie Portnoy is that they are each \"a forceful Jewish woman who tries to control her life and the events around her\", who is \"intelligent, articulate, and aggressive\", who does not passively accept life but tries to shape events, friends, and families, to match their visions of an ideal world.\n\nThe Jewish mother became one of two stock female Jewish characters in literature in the 20th century, the other being the Jewish-American princess. The focus of the stereotype was different than its precursors, too. Jewish writers had previously employed a stereotype of an overbearing matron, but its focus had always been not the woman, but the ineffectual man whom she dominated, out of necessity. The focus of the Jewish mother stereotype that arose was based in a shift in economic circumstances of American Jews during the 20th century. American Jews were no longer struggling first generation immigrants, living in impoverished neighborhoods. The \"soldier woman\" work ethos of Jewish women, and the levels of anxiety and dramatization of their lives, was seen as unduly excessive for lifestyles that had (for middle-class Jews) become far more secure and suburban by the middle of the century. Jewish literature came to focus upon the differences between Jewish women and what Jews saw as being the various idealized views of American women, the \"blonde bombshell\", the \"sex kitten\", or the sweet docile \"apple-pie\" blonde who always supported her man. In contrast, Jewish writers viewed the still articulate and intelligent Jewish woman as being, by comparison, pushy, unrefined, and unattractive.\n\nFishman describes the Jewish mother stereotype used by male Jewish writers as \"a grotesque mirror image of the proverbial Woman of Valor\". A Jewish mother was a woman who had her own ideas about life, who attempted to conquer her sons and her husband, and who used food, hygiene, and guilt as her weapons. Like Helmreich, Fishman observes that while it began as a universal \"gender\" stereotype, exemplified by Erik Erikson's critique of \"Momism\" in 1950 and Philip Wylie's blast, in his 1942 \"Generation of Vipers\", against \"dear old Mom\" tying all of male America to her apron strings, it quickly became highly associated with Jewish mothers in particular, in part because the idea became a staple of Jewish American fiction.\n\nThis stereotype enjoyed a mixed reception in the mid-20th century. In her 1967 essay \"In Defense of the Jewish Mother\", Zena Smith Blau defended the stereotype, asserting that the ends, inculcating virtues that resulted in success, justified the means, control through love and guilt. Being tied to mamma kept Jewish boys away from \"[g]entile friends, particularly those from poor, immigrant families with rural origins in which parents did not value education\". One example of the stereotype, as it had developed by the 1970s, was the character of Ida Morgenstern, mother of Rhoda Morgenstern, who first appeared in a recurring role on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", and later as a regular on its spinoff \"Rhoda\".\n\nAccording to Alisa Lebow, in the late 20th century and 21st century the stereotype of the Jewish mother has \"gone missing\" from movies. She observes that there appears to have been no conscious effort on the part of screenwriters or film-makers to rewrite or change the stereotype, in pursuance of some revisionist agenda, but that it has simply fallen back a generation. Despite this, the concept of the Jewish mother while declining in film can still be seen in popular culture. One use of the Jewish mother stereotype-trope can be seen in the popular television program \"The Big Bang Theory\", which premiered in 2007, and was played by the character of Howard Wolowitz's mother who is only heard as a voice character. Mrs. Wolowitz is loud, overbearing, and over-protective of her son. In the television show \"South Park\", Sheila Broflovski, mother of main character Kyle Broflovski, is Jewish and represents a caricature of the stereotypes associated with her ethnicity and role, such as speaking loudly and with a Long Island accent and being overprotective of her son.\n\nJewish-American princess (JAP) is a pejorative stereotype that portrays some Jewish women as spoiled brats, implying materialism and selfishness, attributed to a pampered or wealthy background. This stereotype of American Jewish women has been portrayed frequently in contemporary US media since the mid-20th century. \"JAPs\" are portrayed as used to privilege, materialistic, and neurotic. An example of the humorous use of this stereotype appears in the song \"Jewish Princess\" on the Frank Zappa album \"Sheik Yerbouti\". Female Jewish comedians such as Sarah Silverman have also satirized the stereotype, as did filmmaker Robert Townsend in his comedy \"B*A*P*S\" (see also Black American Princess for more information on this related pejorative stereotype).\n\nAccording to Machacek and Wilcox, the stereotype of the Jewish-American Princess did not emerge until after World War II and is \"peculiar to the U.S. scene\". In 1987, the American Jewish Committee held a conference on \"Current Stereotypes of Jewish Women\" which argued that such jokes \"represent a resurgence of sexist and anti-Semitic invective masking a \"scrim of misogyny.'\"\n\nThe stereotype was partly a construct of, and popularized by, some post-war Jewish male writers, notably Herman Wouk in his 1955 novel \"Marjorie Morningstar\" and Philip Roth in his 1959 novel \"Goodbye, Columbus\", featuring protagonists who fit the stereotype.\n\nThe term \"JAP\" and the associated stereotype gained attention beginning in the 1970s with the publication of several non-fiction articles such as Barbara Meyer's \"Cosmopolitan\" article \"Sex and the Jewish Girl\" and the 1971 cover article in \"New York\" magazine by Julie Baumgold, \"The Persistence of the Jewish Princess\". \"JAP\" jokes became prevalent in the late 1970s and early 1980s. According to Riv-Ellen Prell, the JAP stereotype's rise to prominence in the 1970s resulted from pressures on the Jewish middle class to maintain a visibly affluent lifestyle as post-war affluence declined. The concept was the butt of jokes and spoofed by many, including Jews.\n\nThe stereotypical subject, as described in these sources, is over-indulged by her parents with attention and money, resulting in the princess having both unrealistic expectations and guilt, accompanied by skill in the manipulation of guilt in others, resulting in a deficient love life. The stereotype has been described as \"a sexually repressive, self-centered, materialistic and lazy female,\" who is \"spoiled, overly-concerned with appearance, and indifferent to sex\", the last being her most notable trait. The stereotype also portrays relationships with weak men who are easily controlled and are willing to spend large amounts of money and energy to recreate the dynamic she had during her upbringing. These men tend to be completely content with catering to her endless needs for food, material possessions, and attention.\n\nThe stereotype is often, though not always, the basis for jokes both inside and outside the Jewish community. Frank Zappa was accused of antisemitism for his song \"Jewish Princess\", a charge which he repeatedly denied on the basis that he did not invent the concept and that women who fit the stereotype existed. In recent years, attempts have been made by some Jewish women to re-appropriate the term \"JAP\" and incorporate it as part of a cultural identity. It has also been criticized for its sexist basis, and for pejoratively branding young adult Jewish-American women as spoiled and materialistic. Concerns about incidents of the JAP stereotype being used pejoratively at colleges and universities have been noted in newspapers, magazines and academic journals. \nThe American television show \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\", created by Rachel Bloom, features a parody song that can be seen as both satirizing and embracing this trope. \"JAP Battle\" is featured in Season 1 's \"Josh and I Go to Los Angeles!\". Rachel Bloom, and her character Rebecca Bunch, are both Jewish.\n\nThe concept of the \"Jewish lawyer\" is a stereotype of Jews, which depicts Jews and Jewish lawyers as clever, greedy, exploitative, dishonest, and as engaging in moral turpitude and excessive legalism. Ted Merwin writes that in the United States the stereotype became popular in the mid-to-late 20th century when Jews started entering the legal profession. Jews entered the U.S. legal profession decades before the middle of the 20th century – by the time of the Great Depression, many Jews had already established themselves as lawyers.\n\nThe stock character of the Jewish lawyer appears frequently in popular culture. Jay Michaelson writes in \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" that the character of Maurice Levy, in the drama series \"The Wire\", played by Michael Kostroff, is stereotypical, with a \"New York accent and the quintessential pale skin, brown hair and Ashkenazic nose of the typical American Jew\".\n\nThis stereotyping is parodied in \"Breaking Bad\" and its spinoff series \"Better Call Saul\", where the character Saul Goodman is an Irish-American lawyer who pretends to be Jewish-American for his clients, believing that it makes him appear more competent as a lawyer.\n\nThe nice Jewish boy is a stereotype of Jewish masculinity that circulates within the American Jewish community, as well as in mainstream American culture. In Israel and the parts of the diaspora which have received heavy exposure to the American media that deploy the representation, the stereotype has gained popular recognition to a lesser extent.\n\nThe qualities ascribed to the nice Jewish boy are derived from the Ashkenazic ideal of אײדלקײַט (\"eydlkayt\", either \"nobility\" or \"delicateness\" in Yiddish). According to Daniel Boyarin's \"Unheroic Conduct\" (University of California Press, 1997), \"eydlkayt\" embraces the studiousness, gentleness and sensitivity said to distinguish the Talmudic scholar and make him an attractive marriage partner.\n\nThe resistance that a Jewish male may launch against this image in his quest to become a \"regular guy\" has found its place in Jewish American literature. Norman Podhoretz, the former editor of \"Commentary\", made the following comment about Norman Mailer's literary and \"extracurricular\" activities:He spent his entire life trying to extirpate what he himself called the 'nice Jewish boy' from his soul, which is one of the reasons he has done so many outrageous things and gotten into trouble, including with the police. It's part of trying to overcome that lifelong terror of being a sissy.For Philip Roth's semi-autobiographical avatar Alex Portnoy, neither the nice Jewish boy nor his more aggressively masculine counterparts (the churlish Jewboy, the \"all-American\" ice hockey player) prove to be acceptable identities to attain. The ceaseless floundering between the two fuels \"Portnoy's Complaint.\"\n\nMartin Marger writes \"A set of distinct and consistent negative stereotypes, some of which can be traced as far back as the Middle Ages in Europe, has been applied to Jews.\" Antisemitic canards such as the blood libel appeared in the 12th century and were associated with attacks and massacres against Jews.\n\nThe portrayal of Jews as historic enemies of Christianity and Christendom constitutes the most damaging anti-Jewish stereotype reflected in the literature of the late tenth through early twelfth centuries. Jews were often depicted as satanic consorts, or as devils themselves and \"incarnation[s] of absolute evil.\" Physically, Jews were portrayed as menacing, hirsute, with boils, warts and other deformities, and sometimes with horns, cloven hoofs and tails. Such imagery was used centuries later in Nazi propaganda of the 1930s and 1940s. This propaganda leaned on Jewish stereotypes to explain the claim that the Jewish people belong to an \"inferior\" race.\n\nAlthough Jews had not been particularly associated with moneylending in antiquity, a stereotype of them acting in this capacity was developed beginning in the 11th century. Jonathan Frankel notes that this stereotype, though obviously an exaggeration, had a solid basis in reality. While not all Jews were moneylenders, the Catholic Church's prohibition of usury meant that Jews were the main representatives of the trade.\n\nDavid Schneider writes \"Three large clusters of traits are part of the Jewish stereotype (Wuthnow, 1982). First, Jews are seen as being powerful and manipulative. Second, they are accused of dividing their loyalties between the United States and Israel. A third set of traits concerns Jewish materialistic values, aggressiveness, clannishness.\"\n\nAbout one-third of Europe’s Jewish population emigrated in the nineteenth and early decades of twentieth century. About 80 percent of those emigrants chose America. Although there is no doubt that Europe’s depiction of the Jews influenced the United States, there were no immense massacres, pogroms, or legal restrictions on the Jews. Based on the fact that America is made up of immigrants, American Jewry identity is described as \"fluid, negotiable, and highly voluntary.\" Within the first Jewish communities, the colonies gave the Jews the chance to live openly as Jews. The attitude towards Jews in the eyes of the colonial authorities was that they carried several assets for business. Most Jews settled in port cities and thrived in trade by relying on family and community ties for negotiating. Peddling, specifically, improved the image of Jews in the eyes of the early Americans that allowed them into their homes, fed them food, and sometimes let them stay the night in their home. Peddling gave the chance to shed outward appearance stereotypes. Commentators noted they often wore a waistcoat and tie, with a top hat on their heads. For they understood a customer would be less likely to open their door to a shabby, dirty man, than a man in elegant dress.\n\nFrom 1914 to 1918, World War I shaped the identity and attitudes of American Jews for the better, yet is overshadowed by the devastation and tragedy of World War II. For the first time, American Jews were seen as major philanthropists, which is now a central part of American Judaism. The stereotype of being greedy and miserly seemed to be challenged. Aid was provided to Jews overseas by a new organization, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee. By the end of the war, the Joint raised more than $16.5 million, which is equivalent to about $260 million today.\n\nHowever, attitudes towards the Jews change after World War I; from 1920-1940, America saw the peak years of American antisemitism. Many left-wing Jews showed sympathy toward, or even supported, the Russian Revolution. Jews were impressed by the Soviet’s commitment to giving Jews equal civil, political, and national rights, which fueled the Jewish plots conspiracy theories. This era in American history is called the Red Scare. Movements of restricting immigration, such as the Immigration Act of 1924, often had individuals express suspicion and hatred on the Jews. In the intellectual context, social scientists were asking questions like, \"Will the Jews ever Lose their Racial Identity?\" and, \"Are the Jews an Inferior Race?\" In 1938, according to opinion polls, about 50 percent of Americans had low opinions of Jews. Americans still believed the Jews to be untrustworthy and dishonest. Many hoped that the racial stereotypes would disappear if the Jews worked to mold themselves. Massive amount of efforts was put towards Jewish charities, especially for new immigrants, in response to antisemitism in America.\n\nThe twenty years following World War II are considered the American Jewry \"golden age\" because of the triumph of \"prosperity and affluence, suburbanization and acceptance, the triumph of political and cultural liberalism, and the expansiveness of unlimited possibilities.\" The Jews increased participation in typical American culture such as movies, public entertainment, advertising, and organized sports, baseball in particular. More recently, benign stereotypes of Jews have been found to be more prevalent than images of an overtly antisemitic nature. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), released nationwide telephone surveys to analyse American beliefs on the Jews. The league concluded that in 2007, 15% of Americans, nearly 35 million adults, hold \"unquestionably anti-Semitic\" views about Jews. More than one quarter, 27% of Americans believe Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus. The number of African-Americans with strong anti-Semitic beliefs remain high and stable since 1992, with today at 32%. On a more positive note, many Americans have positive views towards the Jews on ethics and family. About 65% of Americans believe the Jews had a \"special commitment to social justice and civil rights.\" About 79% of Americans believe the Jews put an \"emphasis on the importance of family life.\"\n\nJewish stereotypes in literature have evolved over the centuries. According to Louis Harap, nearly all European writers prior to the twentieth century projected the Jewish stereotype in their works. Harap cites Gotthold Lessing's \"Nathan the Wise\" (1779) as the first time that Jews were portrayed in the arts as \"human beings, with human possibilities and characteristics.\" Harap writes that the persistence of the Jewish stereotype over the centuries suggests to some that \"the treatment of the Jew in literature was completely static and was essentially unaffected by the changes in the Jewish situation in society as that society itself changed.\" He contrasts the opposing views presented in the two most comprehensive studies of the Jew in English literature, one by Montagu Frank Modder and the other by Edgar Rosenberg. Modder asserts that writers invariably \"reflect the attitude of contemporary society in their presentation of the Jewish character, and that the portrayal changes with the economic and social changes of each decade.\" In opposition to Modder's \"historical rationale\", Rosenberg warns that such a perspective \"is apt to slight the massive durability of a stereotype\". Harap suggests that the recurrence of the Jewish stereotype in literature is itself one indicator of the continued presence of anti-Semitism amongst the readers of that literature.\n\nAlthough Jews were expelled from England in 1290, stereotypes were so ingrained and so durable that they persisted in English society as evidenced by presentations in English literature, drama, and the visual arts during the almost four-hundred-year period when there were virtually no Jews present in the British Isles. Some of the most famous stereotypes come from English literature; these include characters such as Shylock, Fagin and Svengali. Negative stereotypes of Jews were still employed by prominent twentieth-century non-Jewish writers such as Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene.\n\nUntil the 20th century, the characterization of Jews in American literature was largely based upon the stereotypes employed in English literature.\nAlthough Jewish stereotypes first appeared in works by non-Jewish writers, after World War II it was often Jewish American writers themselves who evoked such fixed images. The prevalence of anti-Semitic stereotypes in the works of such authors has sometimes been interpreted as an expression of self-hatred; however, Jewish American authors have also used these negative stereotypes in order to refute them.\n\n\"Jewface\" was a vaudeville act that became popular among Eastern European Jews who immigrated to the United States in the 1880s. The name plays off of the term \"blackface,\" and the act featured performers enacting Jewish stereotypes, wearing large putty noses, long beards, and tattered clothing, and speaking in a Yiddish dialect. Early portrayals were done by non-Jews, but Jews soon began to produce their own \"Jewface\" acts. By the early 20th century, almost all the \"Jewface\" actors, managers, agents, and audience members were Jewish. \"Jewface\" featured Jewish dialect music, written by Tin Pan Alley songwriters. These vaudeville acts were controversial at the time. In 1909 a prominent Reform rabbi said that comedy like this was \"the cause of greater prejudice against the Jews as a class than all other causes combined,\" and that same year the Central Conference of American Rabbis denounced this type of comedy.\n\n\"Jewface: Yiddish Dialect Songs of Tin Pan Alley\" was an exhibit at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research from November 2015 to June 2016. The exhibit, curated by Eddy Portnoy, was focused on the sheet music of this comedy and used Jody Rosen’s sheet music collection.\n\nResearch on voting in the United States has shown that stereotypes play a crucial role in voter’s decision making on both a conscious and subconscious level. Jewish political candidates are stereotyped as liberal. Since becoming heavily involved in politics and the electoral process in the 1930s, Jewish leaders and voters have taken liberal stances on a number of issues. From there the stereotype grew and is now assumed even though not always accurate. An example of this took place in the 2000 presidential election where Joseph Lieberman was Al Gore's Vice Presidential running mate. He was labeled a liberal even though he described himself as \"pro-business, pro-trade and pro-economic growth.\" Although he had taken moderate and conservative positions on numerous issues, the stereotype defined him to many voters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34085365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34085365", "title": "The Seven Queens of Sindh", "text": "The Seven Queens of Sindh\n\nSeven Queens, (basically, Seven Heroic Women) () [pronunciation ( sat-a soor-myoon); meaning (ست means 'Seven'; while سورميون means 'Heroic Women')] is a name commonly referred to the seven female characters that appear in the poetry of great Sindhi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai in his book \"Shah Jo Risalo\". They are: Marui (مارئي), Moomal (مومل), Sasui (سسئي), Noori (نوري), Sohni (سهڻي), Lilan (ليلان) and Sorath (سورٺ). These seven female characters, which the poet picked from history to convey his poetic message, have remained cultural icons in the history of Sindh for their bravery, passion, loyalty, commitment and character strength.\n\nMarui's character portrays love for the land, its people, her commitment with her traditions, her stance before a tyrant king, Umar (عمر) or as some say (Amar—امر). Moomal's character portrays an image of a passionate soul, brimming with love for her beloved, Rano (راڻو) and suffers at the altar of separation and rejection but does not surrender. Sasui is a daunting lady, who takes a debilitating journey of mountainous tracks to find her beloved, Punhoon (پنهون). Noori is a fisher-woman who enchants the king Tamachi (تماچي) and turns out to be one of the most romantic characters in Sindhi literature like Moomal and Suhni. Sohni is a daring soul, who, in order to meet her beloved Mehar (ميهار) overlooks the hyper waves of the Indus River and keeps meeting her beloved on the far bank of the river and one night falls victim to the river waves and dies. Lilan loses her king (husband) Chanesar for an obscenely expensive necklace and undergoes travails of an unbearable separation to regain her status and character; while Sorath is a loving soul, full of passion and care about her beloved.\n\nShah Abdul Latif had structured his poetry book, \"Ganj\", commonly known as \"Shah Jo Risalo\", in a form that suggested he intended to convey his message to the world through his verse. Among many of intentions behind his poetry, one of his major inclinations was towards highlighting the marginalized populace of the country, especially women. Accordingly, he chose these seven women or () or Seven Queens (basically, Seven Heroic Women) of the Sindhi folktales as protagonists in his stories. These tragic romantic tales are \"Umar Marvi\", \"Momal Rano\", \"Sohni Mehar\", \"Lilan Chanesar\", \"Noori Jam Tamachi\", \"Sassui Punhun\" and \"Sorath Rai Diyach\".\n\nThese heroic women have a considerable influence on all the literature written in Pakistan (Sindhi, Urdu, Balochi, Pashto, Siraiki, Punjabi) and particularly Sindhi literature in India, Moomal and Suhni being the prominent ones. From the texts of these folktales, and especially Latif's poetry, the role of these very women would appear to dominate the role of men as their counterparts. In Umar-Marvi, if only Latif's poetry is analysed, less space is dedicated to Umar's role, most of the story/narration refers to difficulties Marvi undergoes as a result of her abduction by the King Umar in the south-eastern part of Sindh. In Moomal-Rano, Moomal's role overwhelms everything else including Rano's character. Sasui-Punhoon is predominantly the story of Sasui's struggle to find her beloved husband who left her, apparently, for good. Only a little chunk is dedicated to Punhoon in this story. Noori-Jam Tamachi is predominantly the romantic tale from Noori's context. Tamachi is just like a source to help substantiate Noori's perspective. Suhni-Mehar is again the story of Suhni's anxiety and trouble she takes to meet Mehar. Mehar is not more than a figment of reference. In Lilan-Chanesar, again the supposed protagonist is Lilan. However, in Sorath-Rai Diyach, Sorath, unlike the characters in the aforementioned tales, dominates the story in the spirit not the material (space given to her in the text).\n\nThus, the story of each of these Seven Heroic Women (ست سورميون), little or more, one or the other way, relates to the cultural milieu and substance of the evolutionary process of the peoples living in the regions of old India and current Pakistan.\n"}

The embroidery, which has a fine finish, appears like a woven cloth but is made with use of red and black threads with a white cotton cloth background. Both sides of the embroidered fabric are usable and the Toda people are proud of this heritage. Both men and women adorn themselves with the embroidered cloaks and shawls.\n\nThis handicraft product is listed as a geographically tagged product and is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India. It was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under the title Toda Embroidery\" and recorded at GI Application number 135 under Class 24, Class 25, and Class 26 as Textiles and Textile Goods, clothing, and Embroidery, respectively, in March 2013. A certificate of the GI registration was formally presented to the community leaders in June 2013. This was first initiated in 2008 and the agencies who supported this registration are the Toda Nalavaazhvu Sangam, Keystone Foundation, and Poompuhar.\n\nThis art heritage is practiced by the Toda tribals based in the Nilgiris (literally meaning 'neelam', the \"Blue Hills\") located in an elevation range of .\n\nThe Todas (also known by names such as Tudas, Tudavans, and Todar) who make this embroidery live as one small community, population of 1,600 spread over 69 settlements, and about 400 of them are stated to be engaged in the embroidery work) in the Nilgiri Hills in the higher elevations of the Niligiri plateau, in Tamil Nadu. Apart from their vocation as herdsmen of buffaloes and cultivation in the grass lands, they are also involved in the tradition of making many handicrafts items which includes traditional black and red embroidery practiced by the women of the community; the embroidery is usually made on their cloaks called \"pootkhul(zh)y\" which is draped by both their men and women.\n\nMurray Emeneau, a well known linguist of the Toda language, had referred to nine Toda embroidery designs in his paper published in 1937. There are earlier mention in the ancient ethnographic documents of the Toda women working on this art form in the western region of the Nilgiri plateau.\n\nThe local terms used to describe the embroidery work are 'kuty' or 'awtty' meaning \"stitching\" and 'kutyvoy' meaning the embroidered piece. The materials used in this work are roughly woven white cloth, woolen black and red threads with use occasionally of blue threads and manufactured needles. The designs developed relate to nature and the daily cycle of life.\nThe fabric used is coarse bleached half white cotton cloth with bands; the woven bands on the fabric consist of two bands, one in red and one band in black, spaced at six inches. Embroidery is limited to the space within the bands and is done by using a single stitch darning needle. It is not done within an embroidery frame but is done by counting the warp and welf on the fabric which has uniform structure by the reverse stitch method. To bring out a rich texture in the embroidered fabric, during the process of needle stitching, a small amount of tuft is deliberately allowed to bulge. Geometric pattern is achieved by counting the warp and welf in the cloth used for embroidery.\n\nThough their favorite study is related floral landscape, the patterns used in Toda embroidery do not cover many floral motifs but generally cover celestial bodies (like Sun and Moon), reptiles, animals, and horns of buffaloes, made in crimson and black colours. Rabbit ears are a constant depiction on the boundary of the embroidered cloth. Another common design in the form of black triangles in a box design is done in honour of their first priest. Women who do embroidery consider their work as a \"tribute to Nature\". A dead body is always wrapped in an embroidered fabric with traditional designs and then buried. However, coloured stripes are used in fabrics of daily use. As a traditional garment, it is worn by both men and women at all ceremonial occasions and also at funerals. Elderly people of the community wear this cloth daily.\n\nThe inspecting agency to over see the quality of embroidery is the Textile Committee of the Ministry of Textiles of the Government of India.\n"}
{"id": "14463693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14463693", "title": "Winslow Carlton", "text": "Winslow Carlton\n\nWinslow Carlton (1907 – December 6, 1994) was an American businessman and organizer of cooperatives.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard University in 1929, Carlton began work with the Federal Relief Administration, where he worked with self-help cooperatives in California. In this context he was assigned by the Roosevelt Administration to lead a successful project to determine whether it was feasible to develop an alternative mutual self-help economy, in part based on barter, to the conventional economy in which many people were homeless and starving in spite of having skills and being ready to work. In 1935, Carlton married Margaret Gillies, the national director of the Self-Help Cooperative Service. Upton Sinclair used Carlton as the model for his protagonist in his 1936 novel, \"Co-op: a Novel of Living Together\". As in many historical novels, some of the motives attributed by the author to the protagonist were not those of the real person, a source of frustration for Carlton.\n\nIn 1938, Carlton founded Group Health Insurance, the first community based, non-profit insurance plan. Later it expanded to include the first dental insurance plan and the first mental health insurance plan. He later founded Health Insurance Plan of New York City, a non-profit insurance plan for city employees, the first HMO in the Eastern United States, and second in the United States as a whole. In the political domain, Carlton worked on Medicare/Medicaid legislation with Senator Jacob Javitz.\n\nCarlton was a founding partner along with Alfred Jones in AW Jones, the first hedge fund. Modern hedge funds are based on different principles than this early fund, but they use the same term to describe themselves as organizations. AW Jones at the time was based on economic principles of \"hedging\" one's financial commitments with countervailing commitments in a way that led to optimized expected profit.\n\nCarlton was on the board of Henry Street Settlement House internal Henry Street Settlement in New York City from 1931 on, was President, Chairman of the Board and director until 1978. He was founder and chairman in New York of Mobilization for Youth, which became a national model for anti-poverty programs for the inner city.\n\nCarlton was also a founder in Washington, D.C. of the Foundation for Cooperative Housing which established cooperatives so that lower income working people could afford homes of their own. With the help of Congress, FCH established a revolving fund that covered the capital costs of establishing housing. People who were selected joined a cooperative that owned the housing, paying their costs of membership over time. This proved to be a particularly successful model because co-op members were highly motivated to succeed in their lives once they had a homestead to protect and build upon, and because the approach cost the government nothing once the revolving fund had been established.\n\nIn the final decade of his life, Winslow Carlton co-founded and served as president of Selcore Labs, where a new a-cellular pertussis vaccine was developed and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. With its name changed to NAVAC North American Vaccine Company, the company went public and was later acquired by Baxter.\n\nCarlton died of cancer at his home in Woods Hole, Massachusetts on December 6, 1994.\n"}

In recent history, major events of the 20th century, such as the Division of Korea and later the 1990s North Korean famine have played an important role in shaping sex relations.\n\nBefore 1945, in North Korea, women had very few rights. They were expected to give birth to male heirs and rear for them; to assure the continuation of the family line. Women had few opportunities to participate in the social, economic, or political life of society. In traditional Korean society, academic education was not considered important for women, and only a few received formal education. In the 19th century, it was Christian missionaries who established girls' schools, thus allowing young Korean females to obtain a modern education. There were a few exceptions to these limitations. For example, female shamans were called on to cure illnesses by driving away evil spirits, to pray for rain during droughts, or to perform divination and fortune-telling.\n\nThe social status and roles of women were radically changed after 1945. On July 30, 1946, authorities north of the thirty-eighth parallel passed a Sex Equality Law. The 1972 constitution asserted that \"women hold equal social status and rights with men.\" The 1990 constitution stipulates that the state creates various conditions for the advancement of women in society. In principle, North Korean law supports sexual equality.\n\nMany challenges remained however. Although the new regime brought women more equal participation in the labor force outside the home and more access to education, women continued to be considered inferior to men. An example is the strong son preference, and the burden put on women to do most housework, and the different sex roles confirmed by the practice of separating boys and girls at both the elementary and higher middle-school levels. Some aspects of school curricula for boys and girls also are different, with greater emphasis on physical education for boys and on home economics for girls. However, in the four-year university system, women majoring in medicine, biology, and foreign languages and literature seem especially numerous.\n\nNorth Korea remains a highly patriarchal society, and the women's role in the family sphere and in the public sphere has changed several times from the end of World War II to this day. After the war, women were enrolled in the socialist economy in large numbers, and played a major role in the rebuilding of the country. But as the economy improved in later decades, women were less needed in the workforce, and a move towards more traditional roles emerged.\n\nState employees were given rations and most families could survive on that. But during the North Korean famine of the 1990s, these rations, known as the Public Distribution System, dried up and families had to look elsewhere for financial support. Men, even though they are not receiving payment, are still required to attend their government jobs. The cash-strapped government relies heavily on the free labor they get from men and it is unlikely to discontinue this practice anytime soon.\n\nFor men to be free from work, they actually must pay their employer between 20 and 30 times their monthly salary, allowing them to take on other, more profitable jobs, such as repair work. This payment is required even if one is unable to afford food to eat, otherwise they are punished with jail time. The current involvement of women in the labor market is uncertain, because of the unregulated grey economy informal market economic system which has proliferated since the famine. According to Human Rights Watch, women traders in the informal sector are vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation, and \"implementation of rules and regulations over market operations are arbitrary and government officials can demand bribes and sexually harass and coerce women with impunity.\"\n\nThe evils of North Korea are well-chronicled from its political prison camps to the needless and preventable starvation deaths of between 450,000 and 2 million people. That latter estimate comes from an exhaustive report by a U.N. Commission of Inquiry, which found the North Korean government responsible for “crimes against humanity, arising from ‘policies established at the highest level of State,’\"including “extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.”\n\nWhat is less well-known is that North Korea’s women — particularly those on the low rungs of the \"songbun\" system, which categorizes North Koreans by their fealty to the regime — who suffer the most. Many are forced into prostitution by extreme poverty. Due to the unavailability of medical care and drugs, some have turned to opium in the false hope that it can prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Thousands more flee to China as refugees and fall prey to traffickers.\n\nWomen also suffer the worst cruelties in North Korea’s prison camps. A woman named Kim Hye-sook told the U.N. Commission that “the women who worked in the mines of Political Prison Camp No. 18 feared assignment to the night shift, because guards and prisoners preyed on them on their way to and from work and rape them.” Another witness “reported that the guards of Camp No. 18 were especially targeting teenage girls.” A former guard told of “how the camp authorities made female inmates available for sexual abuse to a very senior official who regularly visited the camp,” and that “after the official raped the women, the victims were killed.” A former guard at Camp 16 told Amnesty International that “several women inmates disappeared after they had been raped by officials,” and concluded “that they had been executed secretly.” Indeed, the Commission found violence against women to be pervasive in North Korean society:\n\n\"318. Witnesses have testified that violence against women is not limited to the home, and that it is common to see women being beaten and sexually assaulted in public. Officials are not only increasingly engaging in corruption in order to support their low or non-existent salaries, they are also exacting penalties and punishment in the form of sexual abuse and violence as there is no fear of punishment. As more women assume the responsibility for feeding their families due to the dire economic and food situation, more women are traversing through and lingering in public spaces, selling and transporting their goods. The male dominated state, agents who police the marketplace, inspectors on trains and soldiers are increasingly committing acts of sexual assault on women in public spaces. The Commission received testimony that while rape of minors is severely punished in the DPRK, the rape of adults is not really considered a crime.\"\n\nKim Hwa Suk is a woman who graduated from middle school and decided to work in the fields as a farmer in Pyongyang, she gradually rose to position of responsibility as her talent and dedication became known after she became a leader of youth work team, she attended university after graduating, she became chairperson of her cooperative's management board. Kim was also chosen as a deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly. Media in North Korea made a big propaganda for her and tried to show her as a role model for every North Korean woman.\n\nRi Chun-hee is the most famous woman in North Korea. She's the only lady North Korea trusts to deliver the most important propaganda\n\nShe has appeared on television screens around the world whenever the secretive nation wants to boast about its latest achievements.\n\nAlthough the 69-year-old was believed to be in semi-retirement, the veteran news anchor was wheeled out again lately by the country's dictator Kim Jung Un to claim that North Korea had carried out hydrogen bomb tests.\n\nHong Un-jong is a North Korean artistic gymnast. She is the 2008 Olympics champion and 2014 World Champion on Vault.\n\nWon Ok-Im is a North Korean Judoka. She won a bronze medal in the half-middleweight category at the 2006 Asian games, having defeated Battugs Tumenod of Mongolia in the bronze medal match. She also won a bronze medal at 2008 Beijing Olympics. She currently resides in Pyongyang.\n\nThe great famine of the 1990s changed the North Korean society deeply that the world is still trying to understand the width and the depth of that change. During and after the famine, millions of North Koreans grasped at any survival strategy necessary to feed themselves. Those who did not change, and whom the state did not feed, died. For thousands of North Korean women, prostitution was the survival strategy of last way to feed themselves, and often, their children.\n\nIn Kim Il Sung’s North Korea, the sex trade was invisible to the outside world. That began to change when Chinese traffickers and johns forced thousands of female famine refugees into the sex trade. By the end of the great famine, prostitution had become stealthily ubiquitous inside North Korea. It also became more organized and more predatory, with state officials playing a growing role in its patronage and protection.\n\nIn Hamheung in 2008, a number of high-ranking party officials were accused of patronizing a tea house that also sold sex, and for protecting it against police interference. In Hyesan in 2009, the manager of a state-run inn frequently patronized by central party officials was arrested for pimping women and girls, some in their mid-teens. North Korea’s 2009 currency “reform” drove more women into the sex trade. By 2010, prostitution in Chongjin had been organized by “couple managers” who matched customers, often soldiers, with sex workers, often female university students, and sometimes women who had become dependent on drugs. In 2014, the manager of a North Korean factory in China was accused of pimping out female factory workers.\n\nThe reports do not suggest that the state has consciously chosen to tolerate or profit from the sex trade as a matter of policy. The security forces periodically crack down on the sex trade, but inevitably, when corrupt authorities attempt to police a profitable trade, the authorities begin to see that trade as just another way to supplement their pay. More fundamentally, in a society where officials are the law, where enforcement is arbitrary, and where the state profits from trade at least indirectly, it can be hard to tell the difference between corruption and state policy. Today, the \"Daily NK\" reports that prostitution is increasingly run by well-connected businessmen and protected by the officials they’re connected with.\n\nThe role of state officials in organizing and profiting from the sex trade is repellant, but still not as repellant as the state’s role in creating the conditions that force women into prostitution to begin with. Women who ought to be doctors should not be sex workers. Of North Korea’s many tragedies, there may be none greater than all the human potential destroyed by its unjust and unequal political system.\n\nA North Korean defector informed Ha Tae-kyung, a lawmaker of the Saenuri Party and publisher specializing in North Korea, that were approximately 500 prostitutes in their city, which has a population of 400,000.\n\n“If [we] depend on the simple arithmetic calculation and put North Korean population as 20 million, we can assume that there should be about 25,000 prostitutes in North Korea,” Ha told Sieff.\n\n\n"}

Still, inequality and discrimination persist. Polygamy and forced marriage are illegal but still occur. Enforcement of the law against rape, the punishment for which can be up to five years in prison, is hampered by corruption, ineffective police work, and fear of social stigma. Police incompetence results in most sexual offenses being reduced to misdemeanors. Domestic violence is widespread, with penalties of up to 3 years in prison, but women are reluctant to report cases and authorities are reluctant to intervene in what are generally considered private matters.\n\nFemale genital mutilation has been described as “the worst substantial human rights violation in Benin.” About 13 percent of women and girls have been subjected to it (over 70 percent in some regions and tribes), but the law against it is rarely enforced. Prostitution, especially child prostitution, is also common, with the clients often being sex tourists. Sexual harassment is also common, with many female students being abused by their teachers. Although it is a criminal offense punishable by up to two years in prison, enforcement is slack. Local customs which are unfavorable to women no longer have the force of law in Benin, where women enjoy equal rights under the constitution, including in matters related to marriage and inheritance. Still, they experience a great deal of social and employment discrimination owing to traditional attitudes about sex roles, and have a much harder time obtaining credit and when widowed do not have the right to manage their own property. Women in rural areas play subordinate roles and do a great deal of hard labor.\n\nWomen who have experienced discrimination or abuse can seek assistance from Women in Law and Development-Benin, the Female Jurists Association of Benin (AFJB), and the Women's Justice and Empowerment Initiative through Care International's Empower Project. A 2012 U.S. report commended Benin for establishing the National Council for the Promotion of Gender Equity and Equality.\n"}

They acted as allies of the Congo Free State authorities of the King of the Belgians, while trading in ivory, rubber and slaves.\nIn 1899 they were sent out by the colonial administration to collect taxes. They massacred many villagers, causing an international outcry.\n\nAccording to the missionary William Henry Sheppard, the Zappo Zap people all had tattoed faces and had filed their teeth to sharp points. They dressed only in two minute pieces of palm fiber cloth.\nThey were armed with long spears and with poisonous and steel arrows. Their iron weapons gave them an advantage in warfare, and when armed with guns the advantage was decisive.\nThe Songa people, to whom the Zappo Zaps belonged, also used battle axes (kasuyu or zappozap).\n\nThe Zappo Zaps worked as mercenaries for whoever was in power. They had been engaged in slave raiding long before the Europeans arrived, burning villages, partly eating bodies and selling hundreds of slaves to the Arabs each year in exchange for guns, ammunition and other manufactured goods.\nThe Zappo Zaps did not restrict their cannibalism to ceremonial occasions, as in other cultures. Instead they hunted humans for food even when other game was plentiful. They considered human flesh a delicacy, and ate all parts of the body, even brains and eyeballs. They fried the meat in the same way as bacon.\n\nIn March 1883 Hermann Wissmann, the first European traveller in the region, gave the name \"Zappo Zap\" to a leader known as Nsapu Nsapu who ruled over the town of Mpengie, part of the Ben'Eki kingdom.\nThis was a settlement with more than a thousand people, many of them slave warriors, to the east of the Sankuru River between Kabinda and Lusambo.\nThe group were thriving through slave raiding and trading with caravans from the Arab and Swahili towns on the Lualaba River to the east and from Bihe in Angola to the southwest.\n\nIn 1883 Zappo Zap felt strong enough to challenge the king of the Ben'Eki, leading to a civil war that drew in all the slavers of the region. In 1886, he was forced to retreat to a location near Lusambo, where he built an impressive station. In 1887 he lost a battle on the right bank of the Sankuru and was forced to cross the river with his 3,000 followers. He met the Congo Free State commander Paul Le Marinel near Lusambo, with Chief Mukenge Kalamba of the Lulua, both retreating westward from the Lualaba.\n\nWhen Herman Wissman met Zappo Zap in 1887 he was dressed with a turban, shirt and pants in the Arab fashion. The missionary Lapsley, who met Zappo Zap's son later, said he had a cloth tied about his head and was clothed from shoulder to knee. Lapsley gave Zappo Zap a gift of brass wire and cloth, and received some young slaves in return. Lapsley appreciated the gift, later releasing the slaves and educating them at the Luebo mission.\nZappo Zap died in 1888 and was succeeded by his son, who also came to be known as Zappo Zap, and who moved with all his people to settle near the Luluabourg post in 1889.\nThe second Zappo Zap died in 1894. His brother succeeded him and took the name Zappo Zap, which had become the title of the leader of the Zappo Zap people.\n\nIn some ways, the Zappo Zaps seemed civilized to the missionaries.\nThey wore western-style clothing, lived in square houses and could speak both English and French.\nOn the other hand, with their plucked eyebrows and eyelashes, filed teeth and traditions of slaving and cannibalism they were stereotypes of the Western view of African savages.\nLapsley said the Zappo Zaps were \"magnificent men and handsome women, and carry themselves quite as an aristocracy\". However, he was disturbed by the way in which small girls danced lasciviously in imitation of older women.\n\nThe Zappo Zap settlement near Luluabourg prospered and the Zappo Zaps became the main allies of King Leopold's forces in Kasai. In 1890 they helped drive Kalamba away from Luluabourg, in 1891 they defeated two Angolan caravans that threatened the post from the south and in April 1895 they again repelled Kalamba from the post. In July 1895 they helped put down a rebellion by the Luluabourg garrison.\nThe Zappo Zaps provided mistresses to most of the Europeans, gaining further influence in the process.\nThey became the owners of large commercial plantations operated by slave labour and engaged in the slave trade to a small extent, which the authorities chose to ignore. But their main commercial activity was the ivory and rubber trade, bringing their goods to the trading centers at Lusambo, Luebo and Bena Makima.\n\nIn 1899 the commander of Luluabourg, Dufour, decided to demand rubber from the people of the Kuba Kingdom in payment of taxes. He asked Zappo Zap to provide the force needed. Zappo Zap delegated the job to his ally Mulumba Nkusu.\nAbout 500 warriors armed with guns went to the Pyang region of the Kuba Kingdom where they built a stockade. They summoned the local chiefs and demanded sixty slaves as well as herds of goats, baskets of food and 2,500 balls of rubber. When the chiefs refused to pay this huge tribute the stockade gate was closed and the chiefs were massacred. The Zappo Zaps then killed, looted and burned villages throughout the Pyang country.\nAt least fourteen villages were destroyed, and many people fled to the bush in the middle of the rainy season.\nThe Reverend William Henry Sheppard was sent from the Southern Presbyterian mission at Luebo to investigate.\nSheppard's journal of 14–15 September 1899 describes how he pretended to be friendly and through asking casual questions of Mulumba Nkusu, whom he knew, obtained the story of what had happened and was shown the remains.\n\nHe saw evidence of cannibalism, counted eighty-one right hands that had been cut off and were being dried before being taken to show the State officers what the Zappo Zaps had achieved and found sixty women confined in a pen.\nThe missionaries protested, and to their surprise the Free State officials responded, ordering the release of the women prisoners and the arrest of M'lumba. M'lumba was also puzzled at being arrested, saying he had only done what was asked of him.\n\nIn January 1900 a member of the Executive Committee for Foreign Missions acknowledged receiving reports and letters about the Zappo Zap atrocities from the missionaries, but reminded the mission of \"the necessity of the utmost caution, in making representations regarding these matters to those in authority, or in publishing them to the world, to observe all proper deference to 'the powers that be,' and to avoid anything that might give any color to a charge of doing or saying things inconsistent with its purely spiritual and non-political character\".\n\nHowever, in January 1900 the New York Times published a report giving Sheppard's findings. It detailed the atrocities in the Bena Kamba country and said that the Zappo Zaps were acting for the Congo Free State.\nIt went on \"They are sent out to collect rubber, ivory, slaves and goats as tribute from the people, and can then plunder, burn and kill for their own amusement and gain\".\nThe massacre caused an uproar against Dufour and the Congo Free State.\nWhen Mark Twain published his \"King Leopold's Soliloquy\" five years later, he mentioned Sheppard by name and referred to his account of the massacre.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle mentioned the Zappo Zap in his 1909 book \"The Crime of the Congo\", but said they were forced to extract rubber for King Leopold's forces or they would in turn suffer punishment.\n\nDespite the help the Zappo Zaps had given, it was not until 1910 that Leopold's successors, the Belgian Congolese colonial authorities, had brought the Kuba Kingdom under control and established a military post in the royal capital.\nThe state stopped using the Zappo Zap as auxiliaries and they lost their special position, particularly after the Belgian State took over the colony in 1908.\nThe Songye today are known for metallic decoration on wooden statuary. The Zappo Zap are considered to be the most skillful smiths of the Songye, the most skillful in the DRC and perhaps in Africa.\n\n"}
