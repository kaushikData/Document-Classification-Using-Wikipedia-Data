Thousands of Chinese people including many children had been forced to work as slaves in illegal brickyards, and were tortured by the owners of the brickyards. As of June 2007, approximately 550 people have been rescued from such situations.\n\nShanxi is located in the Loess Plateau in northern China which is known for its rich clay deposits which are easier and cheaper to mine than coal. Through corrupt relationships with officials, slave \"bosses\" opened illegal brickyards. Due to a scarcity of labor in Shanxi, some factories outsourced production to middlemen who recruited workers from other provinces, making huge profits for the bosses. For example, in one notorious case, it was reported that Wang Bingbing, the son of Wang Dongyi, a secretary of a local CCP branch, was the owner of a brickyard located in Hongdong County, Linfen. The owner outsourced the brickyard to Heng Tinghan, who was from Henan. The brickyard produces 10,000 bricks per day. The market price for 10,000 bricks is about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan; the owner, however, paid only 360 yuan to Heng per 10,000 bricks produced. Wang Bingbing and Heng Tinghan, along with three other employees, including Heng's son, were later charged with a variety of crimes including murder, illegal detention, and forced labor.\n\nThe existence of illegal brickyards was first reported to authorities in 1998. On 1 May, Chen Jianjiao, a representative of the Shanxi People's Congress, received a telephone call from a laborer who had escaped from an illegal brickyard. The escaped man also wrote to the chairman of the Shanxi People's Congress. As a result, slave rescue operations were carried out by provincial government authorities without notifying local officials. Over 150 slaves, three of them child laborers, were freed from these illegal brickyards. Chen Jianjiao himself was responsible for helping to free hundreds of them.\n\nThere have been continuing reports of cruelty committed at these illegal brickyards since 2004. On 7 May 2007, Henan TV Metro Channel reported the case of five minors around sixteen years old who had disappeared from the environs of Zhengzhou Railway Station. Having heard of earlier instances of child laborers being kidnapped for brickyards in Shanxi, their parents suspected their children might be found there. Two months later these five were among fifty minors from Henan who were found at an illegal brickyard. Human traffickers had sold them to brickyards for 500 Yuan each. Later in 2011, it was found that the practice had not abated, as disabled men in Zhengzhou were still being kidnapped and forced to labor in the brickyards. The scandal was only uncovered following an undercover investigation.\n\nOn 10 May, reporters from Henan Television, accompanied by two parents, visited the sites of some illegal brickyards in Shanxi undercover. Reporters later visited many illegal brickyards in Yuncheng and Jincheng. The conditions they found were clearly those of slavery.\n\nConcealed camera revealed that the local police refused to take action to rescue the slaves. Later the reporters were allowed into the illegal brickyards with the company of the local police. Concealed camera showed the police keeping them from rescuing children who were not from Henan which showed obvious local government protection for the illegal brickyards.\n\nThe brickyard owners had purchased laborers from human traffickers to use as slaves. Many of the slaves were sold for CNY300 to CNY400 including delivery. The slaves included children as young as eight years old and teenagers. Moreover, brickyard owners hired guards and wolfdogs to watch their slaves. These slaves were forced to work over sixteen hours every day and any mistakes were punished by brutal torture.\n\nOne teenager who was rescued from an illegal brickyard said that, during his slavery, he had been taken to another brickyard by his boss to watch another slave being fed to a meat grinder.\n\nAs the scandal received immediate media attention, it also caught the eyes of the country's major leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. Governor Yu Youjun of Shanxi province offered an unprecedented self-criticism, took responsibility, and tendered his resignation on 30 August. He was replaced by Meng Xuenong, an official who had been sacked as Beijing mayor after the SARS outbreak.\n\nIn June and July 2007, 570 people in Shanxi and Henan were freed by the Chinese government. Of those rescued, sixty-nine of them were children. In response, the Chinese government assembled a force of 35,000 police to check northern Chinese brickyards for slaves, sent dozens of brickyard supervisors to prison, punished ninety-five low level officials in Shanxi province for dereliction of duty, and sacked twenty-four. One brickyard foreman, Heng Tinghan, was sentenced to life in prison, and an employee of his, Zhao Tanbing, earned the death penalty for killing a mentally handicapped slave. However, no senior officials were held accountable.\n\nA group of lawyers from Guangdong created the \"Blue Ribbon Campaign\" on the internet to promote awareness of the situation of children who are kidnapped and taken to these brickyards.\n\nAlthough over 500 slaves were rescued in 2007, the practice has never been stopped. In May 2012, 8 people aged between 12 and 22 were reported as missing, with 6 missing within the previous 12 months near Xinyun Cold Storage, Jincheng Town, Yunnan Province. Seven of the eight families reported their missing children to the police. The police only responded to one report and went to inspect the site once. The 8 missing are suspected to have been sold to illegal brickyards.\n\n\n"}

She privately distributed the document to three friends. In mid-September 2010, during Homecoming weekend, one of these friends decided to forward it onward, and the document went viral. In the faux thesis, titled \"An education beyond the classroom: excelling in the realm of horizontal academics\", Owen ranked her partners based on her criteria for performance.\n\nThe bulk of the controversy surrounded whether she invaded her partners' rights to privacy, and whether the subjects of Owen's faux thesis have a right to sue, as was done in the case of Jessica Cutler when Cutler published details of her sex life on a blog. It also raised questions as to whether double standards exist if the reaction would have been the same had the faux thesis been written by a male. The faux dissertation attracted additional attention because some of the men whom Owen ranked were from the lacrosse team, and there was an unrelated sex controversy surrounding the team a few years prior.\n\nAbout a month after the faux thesis made headlines, the Duke University History Department held a forum about the long term implications of the faux thesis. A few months after that, \"The Atlantic\" published an article discussing this incident in the context of Duke's culture as well as binge drinking by women.\n\nKaren Owen, the author of the faux thesis, grew up in Branford, Connecticut and graduated from Branford High School in 2006. She won a scholarship to attend Duke and was a very avid sports fan during her time there.\n\nAfter her faux dissertation went viral, Owen deleted, closed down, or blocked access to her social networking sites. She stated \"that fraternities 'make lists like this all the time.'\" She also expressed deep regret over the incident, saying that she would have \"never intentionally hurt the people that [were] mentioned [in the faux thesis].\"\n\n\n"}

By promoting public awareness on such issues as homophobia, coming out and HIV/STI prevention, AGLA sought to prepare the ground for the movement in favor of LGBT rights in Armenia.\n\nIn August 2003, President Robert Kocharyan ratified Armenia's new penal code which removes the former anti-gay article 116.\n\nIn late 2004, Armen Avetisyan, leader of Armenian Aryan Union (AAU), an ultra-nationalist Armenian political party, announced that some senior Armenian officials were gay. That prompted heated debates in parliament that were broadcast over the public TV channel. Some members of Armenian Parliament stated that any member found to be gay should resign.\n\nAGLA France organized a protest to denounce the AAU's homophobic campaign and the denigration of gays by Armenian lawmakers and media outlets. AGLA France also picketed in front of the Armenian embassy in Paris. The association also wrote an open letter to the President of Armenia that was published a few days later in the newspaper \"Haykakan Zhamanak\".\n\nIn 2005, AGLA France invited two young men from Armenia to participate in ILGA-Europe's annual conference which was held in Paris. A year later Menq/WFCE, the first gay-operated NGO to fight HIV/AIDS, was registered in Yerevan.\n\nIn 2006, two members of AGLA France celebrated an informal wedding ceremony in the Etchmiadzin Cathedral (Holy See of the Armenian Apostolic Church). An article published in the newspaper \"168 Zham\" (168 Hours) about this improvised marriage provoked a scandal and indignation at local conservative media outlets and among politicians and religious officials.\n\nAGLA France ceased its activities in 2007.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27476080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27476080", "title": "Baluch (Uttar Pradesh)", "text": "Baluch (Uttar Pradesh)\n\nThe Baloch is a Muslim community found in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. They are descended from Baloch tribesmen who settled in this region of North India in the late Middle Ages. The community use the surname Khan, and are often known as Khan Baloch.\n\nIn the 16th century, some of the Baloch moved into Sindh (where they are known as the Sindhi Baloch) and also into Punjab.\n\nMir Jalal Khan was one of the Baloch historical rulers, and from his four sons‚Äî Rind, Lashari, Hooth and Korai spring the four main Baloch tribes. The Jatoi are the children of Jato, Jalal Khan's daughter. These main sections are now divided into innumerable septs. Historically, in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the term Baloch denoted any Muslim camel-man. The word has come to be associated with the care of camels, because the Baloch settlers of the Western plains have taken to the grazing and breeding of camels rather than to husbandry.\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century the Brahuis, with the help of Turks, took advantage of the Balochis weakness after the Rind-Lashari war which lasted for 30 years and had driven them out of the Kalat valley. Yielding to pressure they moved eastward into the Sulaiman Mountains, drove out the Pashtuns, and settled along the banks of the Indus. According to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, Professor at University of Karachi, the Balochis migrated from Balochistan during the Little Ice Age and settled in Sindh and Punjab. The Little Ice Age is conventionally defined as a period extending from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, or alternatively, from about 1300 to about 1850. Although climatologists and historians working with local records no longer expect to agree on either the start or end dates of this period, which varied according to local conditions. According to Professor Baloch, the climate of Balochistan was very cold and the region was inhabitable during the winter so the Baloch people migrated in waves and settled in Sindh and Punjab. The three Baloch adventurers Ismail Khan, Fatteh Khan, and Ghazi Khan, founded the three Dehras (encampments) that bear their names, and established themselves as independent rulers of the Lower Derajat and Muzaffargarh, which they and their descendants held for nearly 300 years. The three brothers founded the settlements of Dera Ghazi Khan, Dera Ismail Khan and Darya Khan. Thence the southern Balochis gradually spread into the valleys of the Indus, Chenab, and Sutlej, and in 1555 a large body of Balochis, under their great leader Mir Chakar, accompanied the Emperor Humayun into India. It is probable that many of the Baloch settlements, in North India (Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh), were founded by Humayun's soldiers. Mir Chakar settled in Sahiwal and his tomb still exists at Satgarha, where he founded a military colony of Rinds.\n\nNow the most important Baloch colonies in Uttar Pradesh are those of Amirnagar, Faridnagar, Ghaziabad, Garhi Abdullah Khan(Kachhi Garhi), Garhi Pukhta(Pakki Garhi), Jasoi and Baghra in Muzaffarnagar District they all villages were rewarded by Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb to four brothers Sher Khan, Amir Khan, Bairam khan,Hashim Khan and their sister's husband Abdullah Khan they all were from Baloch families. They settled in the district during the rule of the Aurangzeb, and rose to prominence as the Mughal Empire disintegrated. Another two prominent Baloch families were those of Tajpuri and Jhajhar, in Bulandshahr District. The Tajpuri Baloch are descended from Nahar Khan, who is said to have from Seistan during the rule of Alauddin Khalji. Nahar Khan was latter appointed governor of Deccan, and his son Sardar Khan founded a settlement in Ganaura Shaikh, and the family rose to some prominence during the rule of the Aurangzeb. While the Jhajhar family claim descent from Syed Mohammad Khan, a Leghari Baloch, who was granted a jagir by the Mughal Emperor Humayun. They played a key role in the post-Mughal history of the Doab region, but began to decline with the rise of British power in the 19th century.\n\nTufail Ahmed Khan Baloch migrated from India to Pakistan after the independence in 1947. He helped many others Muslim refugees from India to settle in Pakistan. Presently many Tajpuri Baloch are settled in Karachi, Hyderabad, Lahore, Islamabad, and different parts of Pakistan.\n\nThe Baloch of Haryana emigrated to Pakistan at the time of independence in 1947. The Baloch now speak Urdu and the Khari Boli dialect, and are found in the Doab region of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Balochs of Rohilkhand accompanied Hafiz Rahmat Khan, Rohilla conqueror. They have now been assimilated into the Rohilla community, and lost their distinct Baloch identity. The Rohilkhand Baloch belong mainly to the Magsi, Leghari and Mazari tribes. These Baloch are found mainly in the districts of Bareilly, Badaun, Bijnor, Shahjahanpur and Moradabad.\n\nThere is also a single settlement of Baloch in Lucknow District, at Baluchgarhi. These Baloch are descendants of mercenaries brought by the Nawabs of A\nwadh.\n\nThe Baloch of North India are now altogether separated from the Baloch tribes of Balochistan and tribal divisions are no longer important. They are found in the districts of Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshar and Aligarh. Their customs are similar to those of the neighbouring Muslim communities such as the Jhojha and Ranghar. The Baloch reside in mixed Muslim villages, occupying their own quarters, and are largely small and medium-sized farmers, with a small number being landless agricultural labourers. Their most important settlements are in several villages in and around the town of Baghra in Muzaffarnagar District. A second cluster of Baloch villages exist in Bulandshahr District, where there are several villages near the towns of Jhajhar and Chanderu. In addition, the town of Faridnagar in Ghaziabad District is home to an important colony of Baloch. They marry with other Muslim communities and some members are endogamous, marrying within close kin, and like other North Indian Muslim communities. The Baloch practice both cross cousin and parallel cousin marriages. They speak both Urdu and Khari Boli, the local dialect in the Doab region of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Baloch are almost entirely Sunni Hanafi Muslims, and like other Doab Muslim communities have been influenced by the Deobandi reformist movement. They have no formal community association, although most villages with Baloch do have traditional associations, known as panchayats. These panchayats exercise social control, and are deal with intra community disputes.\n\nThe Baloch of Balochgarhi in Lucknow District considers themselves simply as a sub-group of the Pathan, with whom they intermarry. They speak the Awadhi dialect, as well as standard Urdu. The community are mainly small and medium-sized farmers, although historically many were employed by the state police. They have no connection with the Baloch of the Doab. There are also small number of Baloch colonies in Sitapur, Kheri and Hardoi. Many of the Awadh Baloch are Shia.\n\n"}

These are domesticated animals that have been bred - or plant species cultivated - for particular traits and features by Basque people in the Basque Country.\n\nSome, such as the Alano Espa√±ol, are not originally Basque but have only survived in the Basque Country.\n\nThe \"Azpi Gorri\" is a breed of goat found in the Gorbeia region between √Ålava and Biscay, the Encartaciones, Anboto and Aramotz in Biscay. With less than 100 animals, it is considered an endangered rare breed.\n\nThe Basco-b√©arnaise (also encountered under the name \"Vasca Carranzana\") is a sheep breed from the Northern Basque Country and B√©arn. Its characteristics are long, white wool, curved horns, weighing up to 80¬†kg. It is mainly a dairy sheep and the milk (7.42% fat content, 5.39% proteins) is used to make the AOC Ossau-Iraty cheese.\n\nThe Basque pig, also called \"Pie Noir du Pays basque\", \"Euskal Xerria\" or \"Xuri eta beltza\", is an indigenous breed of the Basque Country, standardized in France in 1921, and today endangered.\n\nThe Basque Shepherd Dog (\"pastor vasco\" in Spanish, \"artzain txakurra\" in Basque) is a dog breed common throughout the Basque Country.\n\nThe Betizu is a cattle breed characterised as being agile, with a large head and a rectangular profile.\n\nThe Enkarterriko Asto or is the smallest Iberian donkey breed with males weighing between 170¬†kg to 210¬†kg and females 140‚Äì190¬†kg and not much taller than 120¬†cm.\n\nThe Euskal Antzara is the Basque breed of domestic goose. It is raised for both meat and eggs. Ganders weigh geese about less. The eggs are white and weigh at least \n\nThe Euskal Oiloa is the chicken breed of the Basque Country. It has five varieties: Beltza (black), Gorria, Lepasoila (naked-necked), Marraduna and Zilarra. At the end of 2013 a population of 10,872 birds was reported, all from the Pa√≠s Vasco.\n\nThe Latxa (), also encountered as \"lacha\" in the Spanish spelling is a Basque dairy sheep. They are mostly bred in Biscay, Gipuzkoa and Navarre for their milk which is used in the production of Idiaz√°bal and Roncal cheeses.\n\nA medium to small sheep with a fairly coarse wool.\n\nThe Pottoka () is an ancient but endangered breed of mountain horse. They are small horses with a large head, small ears, short neck, long back, shaggy mane and small hooves. Originally these roamed the Basque Pyrenees in a semi-feral state but today many are stabled.\n\nThe Pyrenean Mountain Dog (\"Pirinioetako mendiko zakurra\" in Basque) is a large breed of dog used as a livestock guardian dog.\n\nThe Alavan pinto bean is a type of common bean.\n\nApple growing has a long history in the Basque Country, in particular for use in making Basque cider. The earliest written records on cider making and drinking go back to the 11th and 12th century, the very first being a record of Sancho III of Navarre sending an envoy to the Monastery of Leire in 1014 who mentions apples and cider-making. The other is the circa 1134 diary of the pilgrim Aymeric Picaud included in the \"Codex Calixtinus\" who mentions the Basques being notable for growing apples and drinking cider. The 16th century inquisitor Pierre de Lancre also refers to the Basque Country as \"the land of the apple\". \n\nMany varieties exist and are used for making cider. Azkue's dictionary alone, which was printed in 1905, lists more than 80 Basque varieties of apples. Depending on the desired character of the finished cider, different varieties and proportions of apple varieties are used. Some common varieties include:\n\n\nA variety of mild peppers with AOC certification, grown in the Northern Basque Country in the Espelette area.\n\nPelua cherries are an early Basque black cherry cultivar.\n\nXapata () cherries are a variety of black cherry with a very short fruiting season, lasting only a few weeks around June. They are cultivates mainly in the area around the Lapurdian town of Itxassou.\n\nSeveral breeds of animals are common both in the Basque Country and other regions straddling the Pyrenees.\n\nThe Pirenaica is a breed of cattle found in the Basque Country, Aragon and Catalonia. There were more than 4000 Pirenaicas in the Basque Autonomous Community in 1995 and the breed is not considered endangered.\n\n"}
{"id": "3738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3738", "title": "Basque language", "text": "Basque language\n\nBasque (; ) is a language spoken in the Basque Country, a region that straddles the westernmost Pyrenees in adjacent parts of northern Spain and southwestern France. Linguistically, Basque is unrelated to the other languages of Europe and is a language isolate to any other known living language. The Basques are indigenous to, and primarily inhabit, the Basque Country. The Basque language is spoken by 28.4% (751,500) of Basques in all territories. Of these, 93.2% (700,300) are in the Spanish area of the Basque Country and the remaining 6.8% (51,200) are in the French portion.\n\nNative speakers live in a contiguous area that includes parts of four Spanish provinces and the three \"ancient provinces\" in France. Gipuzkoa, most of Biscay, a few municipalities of √Ålava, and the northern area of Navarre formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language. By contrast, most of √Ålava, the western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish, either because Basque was replaced by Spanish over the centuries, in some areas (most of √Ålava and central Navarre), or because it was possibly never spoken there, in other areas (parts of the Enkarterri and southeastern Navarre).\n\nUnder Restorationist and Francoist Spain, public use of Basque was frowned upon, often regarded as a sign of separatism; this applied especially to those regions that did not support Franco's uprising (such as Biscay or Gipuzkoa). Overall, in the 1960s and later, the trend reversed and education and publishing in Basque began to flourish. As a part of this process, a standardised form of the Basque language, called Euskara Batua, was developed by the Euskaltzaindia in the late 1960s.\nBesides its standardised version, the five historic Basque dialects are Biscayan, Gipuzkoan, and Upper Navarrese in Spain, and Navarrese‚ÄìLapurdian and Souletin in France. They take their names from the historic Basque provinces, but the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries. Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used‚Äîand easily understood by all Basque speakers‚Äîin formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today. In both Spain and France, the use of Basque for education varies from region to region and from school to school.\n\nA language isolate, Basque is believed to be one of the few surviving pre-Indo-European languages in Europe, and is the only one in Western Europe. The origin of the Basques and of their languages is not conclusively known, though the most accepted current theory is that early forms of Basque developed before the arrival of Indo-European languages in the area, including the Romance languages that geographically surround the Basque-speaking region. Basque has adopted a good deal of its vocabulary from the Romance languages, and Basque speakers have in turn lent their own words to Romance speakers.\n\nThe Basque alphabet uses the Latin script.\n\nIn Basque, the name of the language is officially \"Euskara\" (alongside various dialect forms).\n\nIn French, the language is normally called \"basque\", though in recent times \"euskara\" has become common. Spanish has a greater variety of names for the language. Today, it is most commonly referred to as \"el vasco\", \"la lengua vasca\", or \"el euskera\". Both terms, \"vasco\" and \"basque\", are inherited from Latin ethnonym \"Vascones\", which in turn goes back to the Greek term Œø·ΩêŒ±œÉŒ∫œéŒΩŒøœÖœÇ (\"ouask≈çnous\"), an ethnonym used by Strabo in his \"Geographica\" (23 CE, Book III).\n\nThe Spanish term \"Vascuence\", derived from Latin \"vasconƒ≠ce\", has acquired negative connotations over the centuries and is not well-liked amongst Basque speakers generally. Its use is documented at least as far back as the 14th century when a law passed in Huesca in 1349 stated that \"Item nuyl corridor nonsia usado que faga mercader√≠a ninguna que compre nin venda entre ningunas personas, faulando en algaravia nin en abraych nin en basquen√ß: et qui lo fara pague por coto XXX sol\"‚Äîessentially penalising the use of Arabic, Hebrew, or Basque in marketplaces with a fine of 30 sols (the equivalent of 30 sheep).\n\nBasque is geographically surrounded by Romance languages but is a language isolate unrelated to them, and indeed, to any other language in the world. It is the last remaining descendant of one of the pre-Indo-European languages of Western Europe, the others being extinct outright. Consequently, its prehistory may not be reconstructible by means of the traditional comparative method except by applying it to differences between dialects within the language. Little is known of its origins, but an early form of the Basque language likely was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages to the area.\n\nAuthors such as Miguel de Unamuno and Louis Lucien Bonaparte have noted that the words for \"knife\" (\"aizto\"), \"axe\" (\"aizkora\"), and \"hoe\" (\"aitzur\") derive from the word for \"stone\" (\"haitz\"), and have therefore concluded that the language dates to prehistoric Europe when those tools were made of stone. Others find this unlikely: see the \"aizkora\" controversy.\n\nLatin inscriptions in Gallia Aquitania preserve a number of words with cognates in the reconstructed proto-Basque language, for instance, the personal names \"Nescato\" and \"Cison\" (\"neskato\" and \"gizon\" mean \"young girl\" and \"man\", respectively in modern Basque). This language is generally referred to as Aquitanian and is assumed to have been spoken in the area before the Roman Republic's conquests in the western Pyrenees. Some authors even argue for late Basquisation, that the language moved westward during Late Antiquity after the fall of the Western Roman Empire into the northern part of Hispania into what is now Basque Country.\n\nRoman neglect of this area allowed Aquitanian to survive while the Iberian and Tartessian languages became extinct. Through the long contact with Romance languages, Basque adopted a sizable number of Romance words. Initially the source was Latin, later Gascon (a branch of Occitan) in the northeast, Navarro-Aragonese in the southeast and Spanish in the southwest.\n\nThe statistical improbability and chronological difficulty of linking Basque with its Indo-European neighbors in Europe has inspired many scholars to search for its possible relatives elsewhere. Besides many pseudoscientific comparisons, the appearance of long-range linguistics gave rise to several attempts to connect Basque with geographically very distant language families. Almost all hypotheses concerning the origin of Basque are controversial, and the suggested evidence is not generally accepted by most linguists. Some of these hypothetical connections are:\n\nThe region where Basque is spoken has become smaller over centuries, especially at the northern, southern, and eastern borders. Nothing is known about the limits of this region in ancient times, but on the basis of toponyms and epigraphs, it seems that in the beginning of the Common Era it stretched to the river Garonne in the north (including the southwestern part of present-day France); at least to the Val d'Aran in the east (now a Gascon-speaking part of Catalonia), including lands on both sides of the Pyrenees; the southern and western boundaries are not clear at all.\n\nThe Reconquista temporarily counteracted this contracting tendency when the Christian lords called on Northern Iberian peoples‚ÄîBasques, Asturians, and \"Franks\"‚Äîto colonise the new conquests. The Basque language became the main everyday language, while other languages like Spanish, Gascon, French, or Latin were preferred for the administration and high education.\n\nBy the 16th century, the Basque-speaking area was reduced basically to the present-day seven provinces of the Basque Country, excluding the southern part of Navarre, the southwestern part of √Ålava, and the western part of Biscay, and including some parts of B√©arn.\n\nIn 1807, Basque was still spoken in the northern half of √Ålava‚Äîincluding its capital city Vitoria-Gasteiz‚Äîand a vast area in central Navarre, but in these two provinces, Basque experienced a rapid decline that pushed its border northwards. In the French Basque Country, Basque was still spoken in all the territory except in Bayonne and some villages around, and including some bordering towns in B√©arn.\n\nIn the 20th century, however, the rise of Basque nationalism spurred increased interest in the language as a sign of ethnic identity, and with the establishment of autonomous governments in the Southern Basque Country, it has recently made a modest comeback. In the Spanish part, Basque-language schools for children and Basque-teaching centres for adults have brought the language to areas such as Enkarterri and the Ribera d'Ebre in Navarre, where it is not known if it has ever been spoken before; and in the French Basque Country, these schools and centres have almost stopped the decline of the language.\n\nHistorically, Latin or Romance languages have been the official languages in this region. However, Basque was explicitly recognised in some areas. For instance, the \"fuero\" or charter of the Basque-colonised Ojacastro (now in La Rioja) allowed the inhabitants to use Basque in legal processes in the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 states in Article 3 that the Spanish language is the official language of the nation, but allows autonomous communities to provide a co-official language status for the other languages of Spain. Consequently, the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Autonomous Community establishes Basque as the co-official language of the autonomous community. The Statute of Navarre establishes Spanish as the official language of Navarre, but grants co-official status to the Basque language in the Basque-speaking areas of northern Navarre. Basque has no official status in the French Basque Country and French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. However, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is permitted (with translation), as Basque is officially recognised on the other side of the border.\n\nThe positions of the various existing governments differ with regard to the promotion of Basque in areas where Basque is commonly spoken. The language has official status in those territories that are within the Basque Autonomous Community, where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre. The \"Ley del Vascuence\" (\"Law of Basque\"), seen as contentious by many Basques, but considered fitting Navarra's linguistic and cultural diversity by some of the main political parties of Navarre, divides Navarre into three language areas: Basque-speaking, non-Basque-speaking, and mixed. Support for the language and the linguistic rights of citizens vary, depending on the area. Others consider it unfair, since the rights of Basque speakers differ greatly depending on the place they live.\n\nThe 2006 sociolinguistic survey of all Basque-speaking territories showed that in 2006, of all people aged 16 and above:\n\nTaken together, in 2006, of a total population of 2,589,600 (1,850,500 in the Autonomous Community, 230,200 in the Northern Provinces and 508,900 in Navarre), 665,800 spoke Basque (aged 16 and above). This amounts to 25.7% Basque bilinguals overall, 15.4% passive speakers, and 58.9% non-speakers. Compared to the 1991 figures, this represents an overall increase of 137,000, from 528,500 (from a population of 2,371,100) 15 years previously.\n\nThe 2011 figures show an increase of some 64,000 speakers compared to the 2006 figures to 714,136, with significant increases in the Autonomous Community, but a slight drop in the Northern Basque Country to 51,100, overall amounting to an increase to 27% of all inhabitants of Basque provinces (2,648,998 in total).\n\nBasque is used as a language of commerce both in the Basque Country and in locations around the world where Basques immigrated throughout history.\n\nThe modern Basque dialects show a high degree of dialectal divergence, sometimes making cross-dialect communication difficult. This is especially true in the case of Biscayan and Souletin, which are regarded as the most divergent Basque dialects.\n\nModern Basque dialectology distinguishes five dialects:\n\nThese dialects are divided in 11 subdialects, and 24 minor varieties among them.\nAccording to Koldo Zuazo, the Biscayan dialect or \"Western\" is the most widespread dialect, with around 300,000 speakers out of a total of around 660,000 speakers. This dialect is divided in two minor subdialects: the Western Biscayan and Eastern Biscayan, plus transitional dialects.\n\nAlthough the influence of the neighbouring Romance languages on the Basque language (especially the lexicon, but also to some degree Basque phonology and grammar) has been much more extensive, it is usually assumed that there has been some feedback from Basque into these languages as well. In particular Gascon and Aragonese, and to a lesser degree Spanish are thought to have received this influence in the past. In the case of Aragonese and Gascon, this would have been through substrate interference following language shift from Aquitanian or Basque to a Romance language, affecting all levels of the language, including place names around the Pyrenees.\n\nAlthough a number of words of alleged Basque origin in the Spanish language are circulated (e.g. \"anchoa\" 'anchovies', \"bizarro\" 'dashing, gallant, spirited', \"cachorro\" 'puppy', etc.), most of these have more easily explicable Romance etymologies or not particularly convincing derivations from Basque. Ignoring cultural terms, there is one strong loanword candidate, \"ezker\", long considered the source of the Pyrennean and Iberian Romance words for \"left (side)\" (', ', \"\"). The lack of initial in Gascon could arguably be due to a Basque influence but this issue is under-researched.\n\nThe other most commonly claimed substrate influences:\n\nThe first two features are common, widespread developments in many Romance (and non-Romance) languages. The change of to occurred historically only in a limited area (Gascony and Old Castile) that corresponds almost exactly to areas where heavy Basque bilingualism is assumed, and as a result has been widely postulated (and equally strongly disputed). Substrate theories are often difficult to prove (especially in the case of phonetically plausible changes like to ). As a result, although many arguments have been made on both sides, the debate largely comes down to the a priori tendency on the part of particular linguists to accept or reject substrate arguments.\n\nExamples of arguments against the substrate theory, and possible responses:\n\nBeyond these arguments, a number of nomadic groups of Castile are also said to use or have used Basque words in their jargon, such as the gacer√≠a in Segovia, the minga√±a, the Galician fala dos arxinas and the Asturian X√≠riga.\n\nPart of the Romani community in the Basque Country speaks Erromintxela, which is a rare mixed language, with a Kalderash Romani vocabulary and Basque grammar.\n\nA number of Basque-based or Basque-influenced pidgins have existed. In the 16th century, Basque sailors used a Basque‚ÄìIcelandic pidgin in their contacts with Iceland. The Algonquian‚ÄìBasque pidgin arose from contact between Basque whalers and the Algonquian peoples in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and Strait of Belle Isle.\n\nBasque is an ergative‚Äìabsolutive language. The subject of an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the direct object of a transitive verb. The subject of the transitive verb is marked differently, with the ergative case (shown by the suffix \"-k\"). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.\n\nThe auxiliary verb, which accompanies most main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but with any direct object and the indirect object present. Among European languages, this polypersonal agreement is found only in Basque, some languages of the Caucasus, Mordvinic languages, Hungarian, and Maltese (all non-Indo-European). The ergative‚Äìabsolutive alignment is also rare among European languages‚Äîoccurring only in some languages of the Caucasus‚Äîbut not infrequent worldwide.\n\nConsider the phrase:\n\n\"Martin-ek\" is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending \"-k\" (with an epenthetic \"-e-\"). \"Egunkariak\" has an \"-ak\" ending, which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is \"erosten dizkit\", in which \"erosten\" is a kind of gerund (\"buying\") and the auxiliary \"dizkit\" means \"he/she (does) them for me\". This \"dizkit\" can be split like this:\n\nThe phrase \"you buy the newspapers for me\" would translate as:\n\nThe auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue and means 'you pl. (do) them for me'\n\nThe pronoun \"zuek\" 'you (plural)' has the same form both in the nominative or absolutive case (the subject of an intransitive sentence or direct object of a transitive sentence) and in the ergative case (the subject of a transitive sentence). In spoken Basque, the auxiliary verb is never dropped even if it is redundant, e.g. \"dizkidazue\" in \"zuek niri egunkariak erosten dizkidazue\" 'you (pl.) are buying the newspapers for me'. However, the pronouns are almost always dropped, e.g. \"zuek\" in \"egunkariak erosten dizkidazue\" 'you (pl.) are buying the newspapers for me'. The pronouns are used only to show emphasis: \"egunkariak zuek erosten dizkidazue\" 'it is you (pl.) who buys the newspapers for me', or \"egunkariak niri erosten dizkidazue\" 'it is me for whom you buy the newspapers'.\n\nModern Basque dialects allow for the conjugation of about fifteen verbs, called synthetic verbs, some only in literary contexts. These can be put in the present and past tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, in three tenses in the conditional and potential moods, and in one tense in the imperative. Each verb that can be taken intransitively has a \"nor\" (absolutive) paradigm and possibly a \"nor-nori\" (absolutive‚Äìdative) paradigm, as in the sentence \"Aititeri txapela erori zaio\" (\"The hat fell from grandfather['s head]\"). Each verb that can be taken transitively uses those two paradigms for antipassive-voice contexts in which no agent is mentioned (notice that Basque lacks a passive voice, and displays instead an antipassive voice paradigm), and also has a \"nor-nork\" (absolutive‚Äìergative) paradigm and possibly a \"nor-nori-nork\" (absolutive‚Äìdative‚Äìergative) paradigm. The last would entail the \"dizkidazue\" example above. In each paradigm, each constituent noun can take on any of eight persons, five singular and three plural, with the exception of \"nor-nori-nork\" in which the absolutive can only be third person singular or plural. The most ubiquitous auxiliary, \"izan,\" can be used in any of these paradigms, depending on the nature of the main verb.\n\nThere are more persons in the singular (5) than in the plural (3) for synthetic (or filamentous) verbs because of the two familiar persons‚Äîinformal masculine and feminine second person singular. The pronoun \"hi\" is used for both of them, but where the masculine form of the verb uses a \"-k\", the feminine uses an \"-n.\" This is a property rarely found in Indo-European languages. The entire paradigm of the verb is further augmented by inflecting for \"listener\" (the allocutive) even if the verb contains no second person constituent. If the situation calls for the familiar masculine, the form is augmented and modified accordingly. Likewise for the familiar feminine.\nNotice that this nearly multiplies the number of possible forms by three. Still, the restriction on contexts in which these forms may be used is strong, since all participants in the conversation must be friends of the same sex, and not too far apart in age. Some dialects dispense with the familiar forms entirely. Note, however, that the formal second person singular conjugates in parallel to the other plural forms, perhaps indicating that it was originally the second person plural, later came to be used as a formal singular, and then later still the modern second person plural was formulated as an innovation.\n\nAll the other verbs in Basque are called periphrastic, behaving much like a participle would in English. These have only three forms in total, called aspects: perfect (various suffixes), habitual (suffix \"-t[z]en\"), and future/potential (suffix. \"-ko/-go\"). Verbs of Latinate origin in Basque, as well as many other verbs, have a suffix \"-tu\" in the perfect, adapted from the Latin perfect passive \"-tus\" suffix. The synthetic verbs also have periphrastic forms, for use in perfects and in simple tenses in which they are deponent.\n\nWithin a verb phrase, the periphrastic verb comes first, followed by the auxiliary.\n\nA Basque noun-phrase is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number (indefinite, definite singular, definite plural, and definite close plural: \"euskaldun\" [Basque speaker], \"euskalduna\" [the Basque speaker, a Basque speaker], \"euskaldunak\" [Basque speakers, the Basque speakers], and \"euskaldunok\" [we Basque speakers, those Basque speakers]). These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again. It has been estimated that, with two levels of recursion, a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms.\n\nWhen we use cases with a proper name \"Mikel\" (Michael)\n\nWithin a noun phrase, modifying adjectives follow the noun. As an example of a Basque noun phrase, \"etxe zaharrean\" \"in the old house\" is morphologically analysed as follows by Agirre et al.\n\nBasic syntactic construction is subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb (unlike Spanish, French or English where a subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject construction is more common). The order of the phrases within a sentence can be changed with thematic purposes, whereas the order of the words within a phrase is usually rigid. As a matter of fact, Basque phrase order is topic‚Äìfocus, meaning that in neutral sentences (such as sentences to inform someone of a fact or event) the topic is stated first, then the focus. In such sentences, the verb phrase comes at the end. In brief, the focus directly precedes the verb phrase. This rule is also applied in questions, for instance, \"What is this?\" can be translated as \"Zer da hau?\" or \"Hau zer da?\", but in both cases the question tag \"zer\" immediately precedes the verb \"da\". This rule is so important in Basque that, even in grammatical descriptions of Basque in other languages, the Basque word \"galdegai\" (focus) is used.\n\nIn negative sentences, the order changes. Since the negative particle \"ez\" must always directly precede the auxiliary, the topic most often comes beforehand, and the rest of the sentence follows. This includes the periphrastic, if there is one: \"Aitak frantsesa irakasten du,\" \"Father teaches French,\" in the negative becomes \"Aitak ez du frantsesa irakasten,\" in which \"irakasten\" (\"teaching\") is separated from its auxiliary and placed at the end.\n\nThe Basque language features five vowels: , , , and (the same that are found in Spanish, Asturian and Aragonese). In the Zuberoan dialect, extra phonemes are featured:\n\nBasque has a distinction between laminal and apical articulation for the alveolar fricatives and affricates. With the laminal alveolar fricative , the friction occurs across the blade of the tongue, the tongue tip pointing toward the lower teeth. This is the usual in most European languages. It is written with an orthographic . By contrast, the voiceless apicoalveolar fricative is written ; the tip of the tongue points toward the upper teeth and friction occurs at the tip (apex). For example, \"zu\" \"you\" (singular, respectful) is distinguished from \"su\" \"fire\". The affricate counterparts are written and . So, \"etzi\" \"the day after tomorrow\" is distinguished from \"etsi\" \"to give up\"; \"atzo\" \"yesterday\" is distinguished from \"atso\" \"old woman\".\n\nIn the westernmost parts of the Basque country, only the apical and the alveolar affricate are used.\n\nBasque also features postalveolar sibilants (, written , and , written ), sounding like English \"sh\" and \"ch\".\n\nThere are two palatal stops, voiced and unvoiced, as well as a palatal nasal and a palatal lateral (the palatal stops are not present in all dialects). These and the postalveolar sounds are typical of diminutives, which are used frequently in child language and motherese (mainly to show affection rather than size). For example, \"tanta\" \"drop\" vs. \"ttantta\" \"droplet\". A few common words, such as \"txakur\" \"dog\", use palatal sounds even though in current usage they have lost the diminutive sense; the corresponding non-palatal forms now acquiring an augmentative or pejorative sense: \"zakur\"‚Äî\"big dog\". Many Basque dialects exhibit a derived palatalisation effect, in which coronal onset consonants change into the palatal counterpart after the high front vowel . For example, the in \"egin\" \"to act\" becomes palatal in southern and western dialects when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added: = \"the action\", = \"doing\".\nThe letter has a variety of realisations according to the regional dialect: , as pronounced from west to east in south Bizkaia and coastal Lapurdi, central Bizkaia, east Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa, south Navarre, inland Lapurdi and Low Navarre, and Zuberoa, respectively.\nThe letter is silent in the Southern dialects, but pronounced (although vanishing) in the Northern ones. Unified Basque spells it except when it is predictable, in a position following a consonant.\n\nUnless they are recent loanwords (e.g. \"Ruanda\" (Rwanda), \"radar\" ... ), words may not have initial . In older loans, initial \"r-\" took a prosthetic \"e-\", resulting in \"err-\" (\"Erroma\" \"Rome\", \"Errusia\" \"Russia\"), more rarely \"irr-\" (for example \"irratia\" \"radio\", \"irrisa\" \"rice\").\n\nBasque features great dialectal variation in accentuation, from a weak pitch accent in the western dialects to a marked stress in central and eastern dialects, with varying patterns of stress placement. Stress is in general not distinctive (and for historical comparisons not very useful); there are, however, a few instances where stress is phonemic, serving to distinguish between a few pairs of stress-marked words and between some grammatical forms (mainly plurals from other forms), e.g. \"bas√≥√†\" (\"the forest\", absolutive case) vs. \"b√°so√†\" (\"the glass\", absolutive case; an adoption from Spanish \"vaso\"); \"bas√≥√†k\" (\"the forest\", ergative case) vs. \"b√°so√†k\" (\"the glass\", ergative case) vs. \"b√°soak\" (\"the forests\" or \"the glasses\", absolutive case).\n\nGiven its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard orthography and Euskaltzaindia (the Academy of the Basque Language) provides only general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a syntagma, and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable.\n\nThis scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality that differentiates its sound from the prosodical patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable). Some \"Euskaldun berriak\" (\"new Basque-speakers\", i.e. second-language Basque-speakers) with Spanish as their first language tend to carry the prosodical patterns of Spanish into their pronunciation of Basque, e.g. pronouncing \"nire ama\" (\"my mum\") as \"nire √°ma\" (‚Äì ‚Äì ¬¥ ‚Äì), instead of as \"nir√© am√†\" (‚Äì ¬¥ ‚Äì `).\n\nThe combining forms of nominals in final vary across the regions of the Basque Country. The can stay unchanged, be lowered to an , or it can be lost. Loss is most common in the east, while lowering is most common in the west. For instance, \"buru\", \"head\", has the combining forms \"buru-\" and \"bur-\", as in \"buruko\", \"cap\", and \"burko\", \"pillow\", whereas \"katu\", \"cat\", has the combining form \"kata-\", as in \"katakume\", \"kitten\". Michelena suggests that the lowering to is generalised from cases of Romance borrowings in Basque that retained Romance stem alternations, such as \"kantu\", \"song\" with combining form \"kanta-\", borrowed from Romance \"canto\", \"canta-\".\n\nThrough contact with neighbouring peoples, Basque has adopted many words from Latin, Spanish, and Gascon, among other languages. There are a considerable number of Latin loans (sometimes obscured by being subject to Basque phonology and grammar for centuries), for example: \"lore\" (\"flower\", from \"florem\"), \"errota\" (\"mill\", from \"rotam\", \"[mill] wheel\"), \"gela\" (\"room\", from \"cellam\"), \"gauza\" (\"thing\", from \"causa\").\n\nBasque is written using the Latin script including \"√±\" and sometimes \"√ß\" and \"√º\". Basque does not use \"Cc, Qq, Vv, Ww, Yy \" for words that have some tradition in this language; nevertheless, the Basque alphabet (established by Euskaltzaindia) does include them for loanwords:\n\nThe phonetically meaningful digraphs \"dd, ll, rr, ts, tt, tx, tz\" are treated as pairs of letters.\n\nAll letters and digraphs represent unique phonemes. The main exception is when \"l\" and \"n\" are preceded by \"i\", that in most dialects palatalises their sound into and , even if these are not written. Hence, \"Ikurri√±a\" can also be written \"Ikurrina\" without changing the sound, whereas the proper name \"Ainhoa\" requires the mute \"h\" to break the palatalisation of the \"n\".\n\n\"H\" is mute in most regions, but it is pronounced in many places in the northeast, the main reason for its existence in the Basque alphabet.\nIts acceptance was a matter of contention during the standardisation process because the speakers of the most extended dialects had to learn where to place these h's, silent for them.\nIn Sabino Arana's (1865‚Äì1903) alphabet, digraphs and were replaced with \"ƒ∫\" and \"≈ï\", respectively.\n\nA typically Basque style of lettering is sometimes used for inscriptions.\nIt derives from the work of stone and wood carvers and is characterised by thick serifs.\n\nBasque millers traditionally employed a separate number system of unknown origin. In this system the symbols are arranged either along a vertical line or horizontally. On the vertical line the single digits and fractions are usually off to one side, usually at the top. When used horizontally, the smallest units are usually on the right and the largest on the left.\n\nThe system is, as is the Basque system of counting in general, vigesimal. Although the system is in theory capable of indicating numbers above 100, most recorded examples do not go above 100 in general. Fractions are relatively common, especially .\n\nThe exact systems used vary from area to area but generally follow the same principle with 5 usually being a diagonal line or a curve off the vertical line (a V shape is used when writing a 5 horizontally). Units of ten are usually a horizontal line through the vertical. The twenties are based on a circle with intersecting lines. This system is no longer in general use but is occasionally employed for decorative purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Another 56,785 have Croatian citizenship.\n\nSince 1993, Croatian organizations are appointing their representatives to the Council for National Minorities of the Austrian government.\n\nBurgenland Croats began to emigrate from Lika, Krbava, Kordun, Banovina, Moslavina, Western Bosnia and Gorski Kotar. These areas were occupied by the Turks in the 16th century during the Turkish wars (1533-1584). The refugee Croats were given land and independent ecclesiastical rights by the Austrian King Ferdinand I, because many of their villages had been pillaged by the Turks. This gave the Croats a safe place to live while providing Austria with a buffer zone between Vienna and the Ottoman Empire to the south and east.\n\nThe first wave of emigration came in the 1530s, after the Turks destroyed almost all the settlements between the river Una and the mountain Velebit, along with the land between the river Kupa and the mountain range Kapela. In the second wave of emigration in the 1540s, many Croats left Slavonia. The third and last wave of emigration, came in the 1750s and 1760s.\n\nBurgenland Croats emigrated not only because of the fear of Turkish attacks, but also because they were searching for jobs and better life opportunities.\n\nThe emigration went mainly to the north, but also across the Adriatic Sea to Italy, where Molise Croats can be found today.\n\nThe Burgenland Croats developed their own orthography during the counter-reformation, however, assimilation soon followed with the language being banned from use in churches and schools.\n\nAfter falling under Hungarian rule in the Dual Monarchy, liberal laws regarding ethnicity enabled them to rekindle their language and heritage. However, when a 1900 census revealed that only 18.8% of the population of Burgenland spoke Hungarian, severe policies of Magyarization were implemented, revoking many individual and community rights. The Burgenland Croats were also persecuted by Austro-German nationalists after World War I, and by the Nazis during World War II. During this time, they tried to assimilate the Burgenland Croats.\n\nThe Croats gained minority status in the Austrian Treaty of Independence of 1955. Since then, they and their culture have undergone something of a renaissance, with the language being taught at schools and spoken in Church, wherever there is a large enough minority.\n\nDespite many languages that surround them Burgenland Croats, preserved their Croatian language and its dialects from all the Croatian regions that they originated from. The Burgenland Croatian language, as well as the general Croatian standard language, combines the Chakavian, Shtokavianm and Kajkavian dialect. But unlike the Croatian standard language, which is mostly based on the most widespread Shtokavian dialect, the Burgenland variant of the Croatian language is based on the Chakavian dialect. Burgenland Croatian includes phrases no longer used in standard Croatian, as well as certain phrases and words taken from German and Hungarian. Names are often written according to Hungarian orthography, due to the Magyarisation policies during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Almost all Burgenland Croats are fluent in German.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918, the area in which the Burgenland Croats lived was divided between Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. After 1921, most of these areas became part of Austria, which established a new province of Burgenland, which later gave the Burgenland identifier to these Croats. In 1922, Austria founded the \"Apostolic administration of Burgenland,\" and began to abolish bilingual schools, by introducing the German language to all primary schools. This process was temporarily stopped after \"The National Education Act\", that allowed the work of the Croatian elementary schools, was adopted. After Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, this law was abolished. In 1955, the \"Austrian State Treaty\" was signed. It gave permission to the Burgenland Croats to use the Croatian language in education, judiciary, and public administration. With the adoption of the \"Law on National Minorities\" in 1976, use of the Croatian language in public life become limited. After a constitutional complaint was heeded in 1987, parts of the law were changed and the Croatian language was introduced as an official in 6 out of 7 districts of Burgenland.\n\nNewspapers of the Burgenland Croats are: \"Crikveni glasnik\" (Church Gazett), 1946; \"Na≈°e selo\" (Our village), 1947; \"Na≈° tjednik\" (Our weekly), 1947; \"Na≈°a domovina\" (Our homeland), 1952; \"Glas\" (Voice), 1957; \"Novi glas\" (New Voice), 1969; \"Put\" (Way), 1981).\n\nThe beginnings of literacy are linked to: Klimpu≈°ki misal (Klimpu≈°ki Missal) (1501), S. Consul Histrianus and Anton Dalmatin's Postila (Fasting) (1568), Du≈°evne pesne (Spiritual songs) (1609), and Grgur Mekiniƒá Pythiraeus's Druge knjige du≈°evnih pesan (Other books of the Spiritual songs) (1611). By the mid-19th century, Burgenland Croatian literature had a predominantly religious character and was intended mostly for peasants. The main writers were priests and nuns. In the second half of the 19th century, teachers begin to write, thanks to that many school textbooks and calendars were written.\n\nMost popular Burgeland Croat writer are: J. Mulih (1694‚Äì1754), Godefrid Palkoviƒá (1714‚Äì78), L. Bogoviƒá (1719‚Äì89), E. M. Kragel (1725‚Äì88), M. La√°b (cca. 1746‚Äì1823), J. Ficko (1772‚Äì1843), M. Drobiliƒá (1808‚Äì91), T. Jordan (1815‚Äì93), G. Glavaniƒá (1833‚Äì72), M. Nakoviƒá (1840‚Äì1900), I. Mu≈°koviƒá (1848‚Äì1930), M. Boreniƒá (1850‚Äì1939), Ivan ƒåukoviƒá (1865‚Äì1944), P. Jandri≈°eviƒá (1879‚Äì1938), I.

This voting is done either with or without the consent of the absent deputies.\n\nOther names for this phenomenon are \"vote in the dark\", \"truant voting\", \"multiple voting\", \"vote for himself and for the other guy\", \"piano voting\", \"pianism\".\n\nThe participants of \"button pushing\" are –ú–†s - \"button pushers\" who vote alien card, as well as those that provide for voting card or duplicate card to \"button pusher\".\n\nThe \"button pushing\" is one of the manifestations of political corruption and the crisis of parliamentarism in Ukraine.\n\nThe term \"button pusher\" emerged in the early 2000s in a journalistic environment for designation MPs who vote for their colleagues.\n\nIf unable to attend the legislature personally, a deputy might give his or her personal voting card to a fellow deputy. Alternately, duplicate cards might be issued without the knowledge of their supposed \"owner\".\n\nIf voting for a neighbor, the \"button pusher\" inserts the card for the e-voting system \"Rada\" received from the missing deputy of the card, preferably not getting up, openly or secretly (hand covering newspapers, magazines, or other method) pushes the button to vote for or against the measure.\n\nIf voting for several deputies, the pusher moves from one seat to the next with multiple voting cards and pushes the buttons the same way. One such button pusher was found to have voted on average for 9.8 missing persons. Often when the absolute majority of 226 deputies was required, the button pushers were responsible for 35-40 votes.\n\nWith the \"button pushing\" voting the Verkhovna Rada adopted:\n\nOn the criminal nature of voting for another in the Ukrainian parliament by the analysis of provisions which regulated the legislative procedure.\nPersonal vote required by the Constitution of Ukraine, Article 84: \"Voting at meetings of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine made deputy of Ukraine in person\".\n\nThe presence and direct participation in meetings of the deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine is not a matter of free decision MPs, and under paragraph 3 first part of the 24th article of the law \"\"About the Status of the People's Deputy of Ukraine\" - is his duty.\n\nDecember 6, 2012 the Parliament of Ukraine amended the Regulation (Article 37), which require MPs to register in person to attend meetings of Parliament, to vote and to do it in person. According to the law, before the opening of each session of Parliament shall be registered MPs personally based identification MP and handwritten signatures. In the boardroom deputy recorded through the e-voting system \"Rada\", so that rules out the registration deputy in his stead another person.\n\nIn addition, the European Court of Human Rights in January 2013 decision in the case \"Alexander Volkov v. Ukraine,\" in which the judge found that the vote in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in violation of the established procedure against European standards.\n\nHowever, today the legislation also provides liability for card use another MP (including duplicate) for registration and voting by electronic system (voting for someone else's card), as well as unauthorized intervention in the electronic voting system of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and issuance of duplicate voting cards without the consent of the MP.\n\nThe peak of \"button pushing\" was reached in the sixth convocation at the initiative and organizational support leadership factions ruling majority - Party of Regions and Communist Party of Ukraine. Tactics were quick voting when the current favorable government decisions taken quickly, without discussion or almost without discussion, often in the evening or at night by pressing of the team of \"button pushers\" in 35-40 MPs. Party of Regions faction leadership commits MPs to vote for other members. Before the vote, the responsible persons of the faction of the Party of Regions deputies dealt another card. Defending the practice of non personal voting, representatives of the ruling majority called it \"delegation of authority\". Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine together against criminal liability for \"button pushing\".\n\nFrom the earliest days of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine at the 7th convocation opposition faction in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine - \"Batkivshchyna\", the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, VO \"Svoboda\", made a series of coordinated measures to cease \"button pushing\" by the faction of the Party of Regions.\n\nFebruary 5, 2013, deputies from the opposition blocked the rostrum. A representative of the \"UDAR\" came to the session in the red sweater with the words \"Vote personally\".\n\nFaction VO \"Svoboda\" filed a bill on criminalizing voting for others in the legislature. This document provides penalties deputies who vote this way of imprisonment from 5 to 8 years.\n\nMP, member of the \"Batkivshchyna\" Yuri Odarchenko sued suit against Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine with the requirement to enter personal vote and cancel resolutions passed in violation of the regulations. MP calls implement electronic voting, which makes it impossible to register and vote one deputy instead of another, and to recognize the illegal and cancel the acts of the Verkhovna Rada, which were adopted in the period from December 13, 2012 to January 11, 2013 Lawsuit filed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Ukraine, February 5, 2013.\n\nThere have been many votings, during which mostly MPs of RPA voted instead of other MPs.\n\n"}

Taxi scams are common in Indonesia, in which fake taxis are passed off as real ones. Foreign travellers often get fooled by this trickery, and end up getting robbed by the con-man operating the fake taxi. Violent crime is another growing issue in the country. Pirated and counterfeit merchandise can be easily found in most parts of Indonesia.\n\nProstitution, interpreted as a \"crime against decency/morality\", is illegal in Indonesia. Nevertheless, the practice still is widespread, tolerated and regulated. Prostitution is most visibly manifested in Indonesia‚Äôs brothel complexes, or \"lokalisasi\", which are found throughout the country. These brothels are managed under local government regulations. During or after raids by the police, the prostitutes are able to bribe the law enforcers and be released from custody; this has led to police raids being called \"nothing more than an income source for public order officers\".\n\nUNICEF estimates that 30 percent of the female prostitutes in Indonesia are below 18 years of age. The International Labour Organization (ILO) puts the total number of child prostitutes in Jakarta at 5,000; according to the Jakarta city government, this is concentrated in Prumpung (North Jakarta), Grogol (West Jakarta) Tanah Abang (Central Jakarta), Block M (South Jakarta), as well as Jatinegara and Ciracas (both East Jakarta). Child sex tourism is a problem, especially on the resort islands of Bali and Batam.\n\nCorruption is a known and increasing issue in Indonesia. There are two key areas in the public sector in which corruption in Indonesia can be found. These are the justice and civil service sectors. While hard data on corruption is difficult to collect, corruption in Indonesia is clearly seen through public opinion, collated through surveys as well as observation of how each system runs. Corruption is regarded as a huge expense to the Indonesian government. The Indonesian police force is known to go overboard and there have been reports of assaults against demonstrators in the country. The misuse of ferocity has been panned by the London-based Amnesty International.\n\nIndonesia has put to death a handful of individuals convicted of the crime of murder. Watching porn is against the law, with effect of March 2008.\n\nCrime is segmented into two broad classifications: \"Crimes\" and \"Offenses\". There are a few methods to punish one for crime; this includes imprisonment and fine. The death penalty executed by a firing squad is available and very frequently used, as a deterrent against crime. They say that this gives the firing squad some practice. This has raised concerns from bodies like Amnesty International.\n\n"}

{"id": "11929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11929", "title": "Demographics of Germany", "text": "Demographics of Germany\n\nThe demography of Germany is monitored by the \"Statistisches Bundesamt\" (Federal Statistical Office of Germany). According to the first census since reunification, Germany's population was 82,790,700 (31 September 2017), making it the sixteenth-most populous country in the world and the most populous in the European Union. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.59 in 2016 (the highest value since 1972) and in 2011, was even estimated at 1.6 after accounting for the fact that older women contribute more to the number of births than in previous statistic models, and total fertility rates increased in younger generations. In 2008, fertility was related to educational achievement (women with lower levels of education were having more children than women who had completed higher education). In 2011, this was no longer true for Eastern Germany where higher educated women now had a somewhat higher fertility rate compared to the rest of the population. Persons who said they had no religion tend to have fewer children than those who identify as Christians, and studies also found that amongst Christians; the more conservative ones had more children compared to the more liberal ones. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is legal in Germany, with an age limit set at forty years. As of 2006, 55.7% of Germans age 18 and over were married. According to the 2008-2010 German Community Survey 3-Year Estimates, 51.5% of males and 47.7% of females over the age of 15 were married. The separation rate was 6 per 10 marriages.\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund lists Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, behind the United States. More than 16,000,000 people are descended from immigrants (first and second generation, including mixed heritage and ethnic German repatriates and their descendants). 96.1% of those reside in western Germany and Berlin. About 7,000,000 of them are foreign residents, which is defined as those not having German citizenship. The largest ethnic group of non-German origin are the Turkish. Since the 1960s, West and later reunified Germany has been attracting immigrants primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Turkey, many of whom (or their children) acquired German citizenship over time. While most of these immigrants initially arrived as guest workers, Germany has also been a prime destination for refugees who have applied for asylum in Germany, in part because the German constitution long had a clause guaranteeing political asylum as a human right, but restrictions over the years have since limited the scope.\n\nGermany has one of the world's highest levels of education, technological development, and economic productivity. Since the end of World War II, the number of students entering university has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools are among the world's best. With a per capita PPP income of about $41,370 in 2012, Germany is a broadly middle-class society. However, there has been a strong increase in the number of children living in poverty. Whereas in 1965, one in 75 children was on the welfare rolls. By 2007, one child in 6 was on the welfare rolls, although these children live in relative poverty, but not necessarily in absolute poverty. Germans are typically very well-travelled people, with millions travelling overseas each year. The social welfare system provides for universal health care, unemployment compensation, child benefits and other social programmes. Due to Germany's ageing population and struggling economy, the welfare system came under a lot of strain in the 1990s. This led the government to adopt a wide-ranging programme of belt-tightening reforms, Agenda 2010, including the labour market reforms known as Hartz I - IV.\n\nThe contemporary demographics of Germany are also measured by a series of full censuses, with the most recent held in 1987. Since reunification, German authorities rely on a \"micro census\".\n\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.\n\nSources: Our World In Data and the United Nations.\n\n1875-1950\n\n1950-2015\n\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\n\nPopulation statistics since 1900. Territorial changes of Germany occurred in 1918/1919, 1921/1922, 1945/1946 and in 1990.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the World War II border shifts and expulsions, the Germans from Central and Eastern Europe and the former eastern territories moved westward to post-war Germany. During the partition of Germany, many Germans from East Germany fled to West Germany for political and also economic reasons. Since Germany's reunification, there are ongoing migrations from the eastern \"New L√§nder\" to the western \"Old L√§nder\" for economic reasons.\n\nThe federal republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths when it came to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.\nFertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was only one of the reasons. Women in the GDR had fewer \"biographic options\", young motherhood was expected of them. State funded costfree childcare was available to all mothers.\n\nNote: Berlin is included into East Germany for the year 2002 and 2008. Source: Kreyenfeld (2002); Kreyenfeld et al. (2010); HFD Germany (2010)\n\nAbout 1.7 million people have left the new federal states since the fall of the Berlin Wall, or 12% of the population, a disproportionately high number of them were women under 35.\n\nAfter 1990, the total fertility rate (TFR) in the East dropped to 0.772 in 1994. This has been attributed to the fact that there was a \"demographic shock\" (people not only had fewer children, they also were less likely to marry or divorce after the end of the GDR) the biographic options of the citizens of the former GDR had increased. Young motherhood seemed to be less attractive and the age of the first birth rose sharply.\n\nIn the following years, the TFR in the East Germany started rising again, surpassing 1.0 in 1997 and 1.3 in 2004, reaching the West's TFR in 2007 (1.37). In 2010, the East's fertility rate (1.459) clearly exceeded that of the West (1.385), while Germany's overall TFR has risen to 1.393, the highest value since 1990 - which was still far below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 and the birth rates seen under communism. In 2016, the TFR of East Germany was 1.64, while TFR in the West ‚Äì 1.60.\n\nBetween 1989 and 2009, about 2,000 schools closed because of a scarcity of children.\n\nIn some regions the number of women between the ages of 20 and 30 has dropped by more than 30%. In 2004, in the age group 18-29 (statistically important for starting families) there were only 90 women for every 100 men in the new federal states (including Berlin).\n\nUntil 2007 family politics in the federal republic was compensatory, which means that poor families received more family benefits (such as the \"Erziehungsgeld\") than rich ones. In 2007 the so-called \"Elterngeld\" was introduced. According to Christoph Butterwegge the Elterngeld was meant to \"motivate highly educated women to have more children\", the poor on the other hand were disadvantaged by the Elterngeld, receiving now fewer child benefits than the middle classes. The very well-off (who earn more than 250.000 Euro per annum) and those on welfare receive no Elterngeld payments.\n\nIn 2013 the following most recent developments were noticed:\n\n\nIn the new federal states the birth rate of college educated women is now higher than that of those without college degrees. Differences in value priorities and the better availability of childcare in the eastern states are discussed as a possible reason.\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.\n\n\nDemographic statistics according to the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most childbirths in Germany happen within marriage, a growing number of children are born out-of-wedlock. In 2010 the out-of-wedlock-rate was 33%, more than twice of what it was in 1990.\n\nThe Mikrozensus done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German woman aged 40 to 75 had, was closely linked to her educational achievement.\nIn Western Germany the most educated women were the most likely to be childless. 26% of those groups stated they were childless, while 16% of those having an intermediate education, and 11% of those having compulsory education, stated the same.\nIn Eastern Germany however, 9% of the most educated women of that age group and 7% of those who had an intermediary education were childless, while 12% of those having only compulsory education were childless.\n\nThe reason for that east-western difference is that the GDR had an \"educated mother scheme\" and actively tried to encourage first births among the more educated. It did so by propagandizing the opinion that every educated woman should \"present at least one child to socialism\" and also by financially rewarding its more educated citizen to become parents. The government especially tried to persuade students to become parents while still in college and it was quite successful in doing so. In 1986 38% of all women, who were about to graduate from college, were mothers of at least one child and additional 14% were pregnant and 43% of all men, who were about to graduate from college, were fathers of at least one child. There was a sharp decline in the birth rate and especially in the birth rate of the educated after the fall of the Berlin wall. Nowadays, 5% of those about to graduate from college are parents.\n\nThe more educated a Western German mother aged 40 to 75 was in 2008, the less likely she was to have a big family.\n\nThe same was true for a mother living in Eastern Germany in 2008.\n\nA study done in 2005 in the western German state of Nordrhein-Westfalen by the HDZ revealed that childlessness was especially widespread among scientists. It showed that 78% of the women scientists and 71% of the male scientists working in that state were childless.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office defines persons with a migrant background as all persons who migrated to the present area of the Federal Republic of Germany after 1949, plus all foreign nationals born in Germany and all persons born in Germany as German nationals with at least one parent who migrated to Germany or was born in Germany as a foreign national. The figures presented here are based on this definition only.\n\nIn 2010, 2.3 million families with children under 18 years were living in Germany, in which at least one parent had foreign roots. They represented 29% of the total of 8.1 million families with minor children. Compared with 2005¬†‚Äì the year when the microcensus started to collect detailed information on the population with a migrant background¬†‚Äì the proportion of migrant families has risen by 2 percentage points. In 2015, 36% children under 5 years old had migrant background.(number includes ethnic German repatriates)\n\nMost of the families with a migrant background live in the western part of Germany. In 2010, the proportion of migrant families in all families was 32% in the former territory of the Federal Republic. This figure was more than double that in the new L√§nder (incl. Berlin) where it stood at 15%.\n\nFamilies with a migrant background more often have three or more minor children in the household than families without a migrant background. In 2010, about 15% of the families with a migrant background contained three or more minor children, as compared with just 9% of the families without a migrant background.\n\nIn 2009, 3.0 million of the persons of immigrant background had Turkish roots, 2.9 million had their roots in the successor states of the Soviet Union (including a large number of Russian-speaking ethnic Germans), 1.5 million had their roots in the successor states of Yugoslavia including 200.000 Albanians and 1.5 million had Polish roots.\n\nIn 2008, 18.4% of Germans of any age group and 30% of German children had at least one parent born abroad. Median age for Germans with at least one parent born abroad was 33.8 years, while that for Germans, who had two parents born in Germany was 44.6 years.\n\nGermany is home to the third-highest number of international migrants worldwide after the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\n, the population by background was as follows:\n\nFour other sizable groups of people are referred to as \"national minorities\" (\"nationale Minderheiten\") because they have lived in their respective regions for centuries: Danes, Frisians, Roma and Sinti, and Sorbs. There is a Danish minority (about 50,000, according to government sources) in the northern-most state of Schleswig-Holstein. Eastern and Northern Frisians live at Schleswig-Holstein's western coast, and in the north-western part of Lower Saxony. They are part of a wider community (Frisia) stretching from Germany to the northern Netherlands. The Sorbs, a Slavic people with about 60,000 members (according to government sources), are in the Lusatia region of Saxony and Brandenburg. They are the last remnants of the Slavs that lived in central and eastern Germany since the 7th century to have kept their traditions and not been completely integrated into the wider German nation.\n\nUntil World War II the Poles were recognized as one of the national minorities. In 1924 the Union of Poles in Germany had initiated cooperation between all national minorities in Germany under the umbrella organization Association of National Minorities in Germany. Some of the union members wanted the Polish communities in easternmost Germany (now Poland) to join the newly established Polish nation after World War I. Even before the German invasion of Poland, leading anti-Nazi members of the Polish minority were deported to concentration camps; some were executed at the Pia≈õnica murder site. Minority rights for Poles in Germany were revoked by Hermann G√∂ring's World War II decree of 27 February 1940, and their property was confiscated.\n\nAfter the war ended, the German government did not re-implement national minority rights for ethnic Poles. The reason for this is that the areas of Germany which formerly had a native Polish minority were annexed to Poland and the Soviet Union, while almost all of the native German populations (formerly the ethnic majority) in these areas subsequently fled or were expelled by force. With the mixed German-Polish territories now lost, the German government subsequently regarded ethnic Poles residing in what remained of Germany as immigrants, just like any other ethnic population with a recent history of arrival. In contrast, Germans living in Poland are recognized as national minority and have granted seats in Polish Parliament. It must be said, however, that an overwhelming number of Germans in Poland have centuries-old historical ties to the lands they now inhabit, whether from living in territory that once belonged to the German state, or from centuries-old communities. In contrast, most Poles in present-day Germany are recent immigrants, though there are some communities which have been present since the 19th and perhaps even the 18th centuries. Despite protests by some in the older Polish-German communities, and despite Germany being now a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, Germany has so far refused to re-implement minority rights for ethnic Poles, based on the fact that almost all areas of historically mixed German-Polish heritage (where the minority rights formerly existed) are no longer part of Germany and because the vast majority of ethnic Poles now residing in Germany are recent immigrants.\n\nRoma people have been in Germany since the Middle Ages. They were persecuted by the Nazis, and thousands of Roma living in Germany were killed by the Nazi regime. Nowadays, they are spread all over Germany, mostly living in major cities. It is difficult to estimate their exact number, as the German government counts them as \"persons without migrant background\" in their statistics. There are also many assimilated Sinti and Roma. A vague figure given by the German Department of the Interior is about 70,000. In the late 1990s, many Roma moved to Germany from Kosovo. In contrast to the old-established Roma population, the majority of them do not have German citizenship, they are classified as immigrants or refugees.\n\nAfter World War II, 14 million ethnic Germans were expelled from the eastern territories of Germany and homelands outside the former German Empire. The accommodation and integration of these \"Heimatvertriebene\" in the remaining part of Germany, in which many cities and millions of apartments had been destroyed, was a major effort in the post-war occupation zones and later states of Germany.\n\nSince the 1960s, ethnic Germans from the People's Republic of Poland and Soviet Union (especially from Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine), have come to Germany. During the time of Perestroika, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of immigrants increased heavily. Some of these immigrants are of mixed ancestry. During the 10-year period between 1987 and 2001, a total of 1,981,732 ethnic Germans from the FSU immigrated to Germany, along with more than a million of their non-German relatives. After 1997, however ethnic Slavs or those belonging to Slavic-Germanic mixed origins outnumbered these with only Germanic descent amongst the immigrants. The total number of people currently living in Germany having FSU connection is around 4 to 4.5 million (Including Germans, Slavs, Jews and those of mixed origins), out of that more than 50% is of German descent.\n\nGermany now has Europe's third-largest Jewish population. In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total inflow to more than 100,000 since 1991. Jews have a voice in German public life through the Central Council of Jews in Germany (Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland). Some Jews from the former Soviet Union are of mixed heritage.\n\nIn 2000 there were also around 300,000‚Äì500,000 Afro-Germans (those who have German citizenship) and 150,000+ African nationals. Most of them live in Berlin and Hamburg. Numerous persons from Tunisia and Morocco live in Germany. While they are considered members of a minority group, for the most part, they do not considers themselves \"Afro-Germans,\" nor are most of them perceived as such by the German people. However, Germany does not keep any statistics regarding ethnicity or race. Hence, the exact number of Germans of African descent is unknown.\n\nGermany's biggest East Asian minority are the Vietnamese people in Germany. About 40,000 Vietnamese live in Berlin and surroundings. Also there are about 20,000 to 25,000 Japanese people residing in Germany. Some South Asian and Southeast Asian immigration has taken place. Nearly 50,000 Indians live in Germany. As of 2008, there were 68,000 Filipino residents and an unknown number of Indonesians residing in Germany.\n\nNumerous descendants of the so-called \"Gastarbeiter\" live in Germany. The \"Gastarbeiter\" mostly came from Chile, Greece, southern Italy, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia.\nAlso included were Vietnam, Mongolia, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba when the former East Germany existed until reunification in 1990. The (socialist) German Democratic Republic (East Germany) however had their guest-workers stay in single-sex dormitories. Female guest workers had to sign contracts saying that they were not allowed to fall pregnant during their stay. If they fell pregnant nevertheless they faced forced abortion or deportation. This is one of the reasons why the vast majority of ethnic minorities today lives in western Germany and also one of the reasons why minorities such as the Vietnamese have the most unusual population pyramid, with nearly all second-generation Vietnamese Germans born after 1989.\n\n, the numbers of selected groups of resident foreign nationals (non-naturalized residents) in Germany were as follows:\n\nThis list does not include foreigners with German nationality and foreign nationals without resident status.\nThe most common Y chromosome haplogroups among German males are Haplogroup R1b, followed by Haplogroup I1, and Haplogroup R1a.\n\nWith an estimated more than 81.8¬†million inhabitants in late 2011, Germany is the most populous country in the European Union and ranks as the 16th largest country in the world in terms of population. Its population density stands at 229.4 inhabitants per square kilometer.\n\nGermany comprises sixteen states that are collectively referred to as \"L√§nder\". Due to differences in size and population the subdivision of these states varies, especially between city-states (\"Stadtstaaten\") and states with larger territories (\"Fl√§chenl√§nder\"). For regional administrative purposes five states, namely Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony, consist of a total of 22 Government Districts (\"Regierungsbezirke\"). As of 2009 Germany is divided into 403 districts (\"Kreise\") on municipal level, these consist of 301 rural districts and 102 urban districts.\n\nGermany officially has eleven metropolitan regions. In 2005, Germany had 82 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nOver ten million people living in Germany today were born outside of Germany; equivalent to 12% of the German population. Most immigrants come from other European countries, particularly from Turkey, Russia, Poland and Italy. Germany is the second-most popular destination for immigrants in the world after the United States. The German Government has been keen to encourage immigration over the past fifty years.\n\nGermany had signed special visa agreements with several countries in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within the country. During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the governments of Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and Spain to help Germany overcome its severe labour shortage.\n\nAs of 2012, the largest sources of net immigration to Germany are other European countries, most importantly Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Spain, and Greece; notably, in the case of Turkey, German Turks moving to Turkey slightly outnumber new immigrants.\n\nIn 2015, there were 476,649 asylum applications.\n\nResponsibility for educational oversight in Germany lies primarily with the individual federated states. Since the 1960s, a reform movement has attempted to unify secondary education into a \"Gesamtschule\" (comprehensive school); several West German states later simplified their school systems to two or three tiers. A system of apprenticeship called \"Duale Ausbildung\" (\"dual education\") allows pupils in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run vocational school.\n\nOptional kindergarten education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which school attendance is compulsory for at least nine years. Primary education usually lasts for four years and public schools are not stratified at this stage. In contrast, secondary education includes three traditional types of schools focused on different levels of academic ability: the \"Gymnasium\" enrols the most academically promising children and prepares students for university studies; the \"Realschule\" for intermediate students lasts six years; the \"Hauptschule\" prepares pupils for vocational education.\n\nIn addition Germany has a comprehensive school known as the \"Gesamtschule\". While some German schools such as the Gymnasium and the Realschule have rather strict entrance requirements, the Gesamtschule does not have such requirements. They offer college preparatory classes for the students who are doing well, general education classes for average students, and remedial courses for those who aren't doing that well. In most cases students attending a Gesamtschule may graduate with the Hauptschulabschluss, the Realschulabschluss or the Abitur depending on how well they did in school.\nThe percentage of students attending a Gesamtschule varies by Bundesland. In 2007 the State of Brandenburg more than 50% of all students attended a Gesamtschule, while in the State of Bavaria less than 1% did.\n\nThe general entrance requirement for university is Abitur, a qualification normally based on continuous assessment during the last few years at school and final examinations; however there are a number of exceptions, and precise requirements vary, depending on the state, the university and the subject. Germany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2008, six of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 18 of the top 200. Nearly all German universities are public institutions, tuition fees in the range of ‚Ç¨500 were introduced in some states after 2006, but quickly abolished again until 2014.\n\n\"Percentage of jobholders holding Hauptschulabschluss, Realschulabschluss or Abitur in Germany\"\n\nOver 99% of those of age 15 and above are estimated to be able to read and write. However, a growing number of inhabitants are functionally illiterate. The young are much more likely to be functionally illiterate than the old. According to a study done by the University of Bremen in coorporation with the \"Bundesverband Alphabetisierung e.V.\", 10% of youngsters living in Germany are functionally illiterate and one quarter are able to understand only basic level texts. Illiteracy rates of youngsters vary by ethnic group and parents' socioeconomic class.\n\n, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 42%, followed by malignant tumours, at 25%.\n, about 82,000 Germans had been infected with HIV/AIDS and 26,000 had died from the disease (cumulatively, since 1982).\nAccording to a 2005 survey, 27% of German adults are smokers.\nA 2009 study shows Germany is near the median in terms of overweight and obese people in Europe.\n\nThe national constitutions of 1919 and 1949 guarantee freedom of faith and religion; earlier, these freedoms were mentioned only in state constitutions. The modern constitution of 1949 also states that no one may be discriminated against due to their faith or religious opinions. A state church does not exist in Germany (see Freedom of religion in Germany).\nAccording to a 1990s poll by \"Der Spiegel\", 45% of Germans believe in God, and a quarter in Jesus Christ. According to the Eurobarometer Poll 2010, 44% of German citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", 25% responded that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and 27% responded that \"they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force\". 4% gave no response.\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Germany, comprising an estimated 57.9% of the country's population. \n\nIslam is the second largest religion in Germany, with an estimated 6.1% of the population according to a 2017 Pew Research Survey. Germany has the second largest Muslim population in Europe, at nearly 5 million, and is expected to grow significantly in the coming decades.\n\nSmaller religious groups (less than 1%) include Judaism, Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\nThe two largest churches, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), have lost significant number of adherents. In 2016 the Catholic Church accounted for 28.5% and the Evangelical Church for 26.5% of the population. Other Christian churches and groups summed up to 3.3% with estimations for the Orthodox Church between 1.3% and 1.9%.\nSince the reunification of Germany, the number of non-religious people has grown and an estimated 36.2% of the country's population are not affiliated with any church or religion.\n\nThe other religions make up to less than 1% of the population. Buddhism has around 200,000 adherents (0.2%), Judaism has around 200.000 adherents (0.2%), Hinduism 90,000 (0.1%), Sikhism 75,000 (0.1%) and Yazidis religion (45,000-60,000). All other religious communities in Germany have fewer than 50,000 (<0.1%) adherents.\nProtestantism is concentrated in the north and east and Roman Catholicism is concentrated in the south and west. According to the last nationwide census, Protestantism is more widespread among the population with German citizenship; there are slightly more Catholics total because of the Catholic immigrant population (including such groups as Poles and Italians). The former Pope, Benedict XVI, was born in Bavaria. Non-religious people, including atheists and agnostics, might make up as many as 55% of the total population, and are especially numerous in the former East Germany and major metropolitan areas.\n\nOf the roughly 4 million Muslims, most are Sunnis and Alevites from Turkey, but there are a small number of Shi'ites and other denominations. 1.3% of the country's overall population declare themselves Orthodox Christians, with Serbs, Greeks, Montenegrins, Ukrainians and Russians being the most numerous. Germany has Europe's third-largest Jewish population (after France and the United Kingdom). In 2004, twice as many Jews from former Soviet republics settled in Germany as in Israel, bringing the total Jewish population to more than 200,000, compared to 30,000 prior to German reunification. Large cities with significant Jewish populations include Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich. Around 250,000 active Buddhists live in Germany; 50% of them are Asian immigrants.\n\nCensus results were as follows:\n\n\nGerman is the only official and most widely spoken language. Standard German is understood throughout the country.\n\nDanish, Low German, Low Rhenish, the Sorbian languages (Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian), and the two Frisian languages, Saterfrisian and North Frisian, are officially recognized and protected as minority languages by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in their respective regions. With speakers of Romany living in all parts of Germany, the federal government has promised to take action to protect the language. Until now, only Hesse has followed Berlin's announcement, and agreed on implementing concrete measures to support Romany speakers.\n\nImplementation of the Charter is poor. The monitoring reports on charter implementation in Germany show many provisions unfulfilled. \n\nGerman dialects ‚Äì some quite distinct from the standard language ‚Äì are used in everyday speech, especially in rural regions. Many dialects, for example the Upper German varieties, are to some degree cultivated as symbols of regional identity and have their own literature, theaters and some TV programming. While speaking a dialect outside its native region might be frowned upon, in their native regions some dialects can be spoken by all social classes. . Nevertheless, partly due to the prevalence of Standard German in media, the use of dialects has declined over the past century, especially in the younger population.\n\nThe social status of different German dialects can vary greatly. The Alemannic and Bavarian dialects of the south are positively valued by their speakers and can be used in almost all social circumstances. The Saxonian and Thuringian dialects have less prestige and are subject to derision. While Bavarian and Alemannic have kept much of their distinctiveness, the Middle German dialects, which are closer to Standard German, have lost some of their distinctive lexical and grammatical features and tend to be only pronunciation variants of Standard German.\n\nLow Saxon is officially recognized as a language on its own, but despite this fact, there's little official action taken on fostering the language. Historically one third of Germany's territory and population was Low Saxon speaking. No data was ever collected on the actual number of speakers, but today the number of speakers ranges around 5 million persons. Despite this relatively high number of speakers there is very little coverage in the media (mostly on NDR TV, no regular programming) and very little education in or on the language. The language is not fixed as part of the school curriculum and Low Saxon is used as a medium of instruction in one school only in the whole Germany (as a \"model project\" in primary school sided by education in Standard German). As a consequence the younger generation refused to adopt the native language of their parents. Language prevalence dropped from more than 90% (depending on the exact region) in the 1930s to less than 5% today. This accounts for a massive intergenerational gap in language use. Older people regularly use the language and take private initiative to maintain the language, but the lack of innovative potential of the younger generation hinders language maintenance. The language too has an own literature (around 150 published books every year) and there are many theatres (mostly lay stages, but some professional ones, like for example Ohnsorg-Theater).\n\nUse of Low Saxon is mainly restricted to use among acquaintances, like family members, neighbours and friends. A meeting of a village council can be held almost completely in Low Saxon if all participants know each other (as long as written protocols are written in Standard German), but a single foreigner can make the whole switching to Standard German.\n\nThe Low Saxon dialects are different in their status too. There's a north-south gradient in language maintenance. The Southern dialects of Westfalian, Eastfalian and Brandenburgish have had much stronger speaker losses, than the northern coastal dialects of Northern Low Saxon. While Eastfalian has lost speakers to Standard German, Westfalian has lost speakers to Standard German and Standard German based regiolect of the Rhine-Ruhr area. Brandenburgish speakers mostly switched to the Standard German-based regiolect of Berlin. Brandenburgish is almost completely replaced by the Berlin regiolect. Northern Low Saxon speakers switched mostly to pure Standard German.\n\nEnglish is the most common foreign language and almost universally taught by the secondary level; it is also taught at elementary level in some states. Other commonly-taught languages are French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian. Dutch is taught in states bordering the Netherlands, and Polish in the eastern states bordering Poland. Latin and Ancient Greek are part of the classical education syllabus offered in many secondary schools.\n\nAccording to a 2004 survey, two-thirds of Germany's citizens have at least basic knowledge of English. About 20% consider themselves to be competent speakers of French, followed by speakers of Russian (7%), Italian (6.1%), and Spanish (5.6%). The relatively high number of Russian speakers is a result of massive immigration from the former Soviet Union to Germany for almost 10 consecutive years, plus its having been learned in school by many older former East Germans.\n\n"}

{"id": "347511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=347511", "title": "Estonians", "text": "Estonians\n\nEstonians () are a Finnic ethnic group native to Estonia who speak the Estonian language.\n\nEstonia was first inhabited about 10,000 years ago, just after the Baltic ice lake had retreated from Estonia. While it is not certain what languages were spoken by the first settlers, it is often maintained that speakers of early Uralic languages related to modern Estonian had arrived in what is now Estonia by about 5,000 years ago. Living in the same area for more than 5,000 years would put the ancestors of Estonians among the oldest permanent inhabitants in Europe. On the other hand, some recent linguistic estimations suggest that Finno-Ugrian language arrived around the Baltic Sea considerably later, perhaps during the Early Bronze Age (ca. 1800 BCE).\n\nThe oldest known endonym of the Estonians is . \"Eesti\", the modern endonym of Estonia, is thought to be derived from the word \"Aestii\", the name given by the ancient Germanic people to the Baltic people living northeast of the Vistula River. The Roman historian Tacitus in 98 AD was the first to mention the \"\"Aestii\" people, and early Scandinavians called the land south of the Gulf of Finland \"Eistland\" ( is also the current word in Icelandic for Estonia), and the people \"eistr\"\". Proto-Estonians (as well as other speakers of the Finnish language group) were also called \"Chuds\" () in Old East Slavic chronicles.\n\nThe Estonian language belongs to the Finnic branch of the Uralic family of languages, as does the Finnish language. The first known book in Estonian was printed in 1525, while the oldest known examples of written Estonian originate in 13th-century chronicles.\n\nAlthough Estonian national consciousness spread in the course of the 19th century during the Estonian national awakening, some degree of ethnic awareness preceded this development. By the 18th century the self-denomination spread among Estonians along with the older . Anton thor Helle's translation of the Bible into Estonian appeared in 1739, and the number of books and brochures published in Estonian increased from 18 in the 1750s to 54 in the 1790s. By the end of the century more than a half of adult peasants could read. The first university-educated intellectuals identifying themselves as Estonians, including Friedrich Robert Faehlmann (1798‚Äì1850), Kristjan Jaak Peterson (1801‚Äì1822) and Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald (1803‚Äì1882), appeared in the 1820s. The ruling elites had remained predominantly German in language and culture since the conquest of the early 13th century. Garlieb Merkel (1769‚Äì1850), a Baltic-German Estophile, became the first author to treat the Estonians as a nationality equal to others; he became a source of inspiration for the Estonian national movement, modelled on Baltic German cultural world before the middle of the 19th century. However, in the middle of the century, the Estonians became more ambitious and started leaning toward the Finns as a successful model of national movement and, to some extent, toward the neighbouring Latvian national movement. By the end of 1860 the Estonians became unwilling to reconcile with German cultural and political hegemony. Before the attempts at Russification in the 1880s, their view of Imperial Russia remained positive.\n\nEstonians have strong ties to the Nordic countries stemming from important cultural and religious influences gained over centuries during Scandinavian and German rule and settlement. Indeed, Estonians consider themselves Nordic rather than Baltic, in particular because of close ethnic and linguistic affinities with the Finns.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Tartu (1920) recognised Estonia's 1918 independence from Russia, ethnic Estonians residing in Russia gained the option of opting for Estonian citizenship (those who opted were called \"optandid\" - 'optants') and returning to their fatherland. An estimated 40,000 Estonians lived in Russia in 1920. In sum, 37,578 people moved from Soviet Russia to Estonia (1920‚Äì1923).\n\nDuring World War II, when Estonia was invaded by the Soviet Army in 1944, large numbers of Estonians fled their homeland on ships or smaller boats over the Baltic Sea. Many refugees who survived the risky sea voyage to Sweden or Germany later moved from there to Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States or Australia. Some of these refugees and their descendants returned to Estonia after the nation regained its independence in 1991.\n\nOver the years of independence, increasing numbers of Estonians have chosen to work abroad, primarily in Finland, but also in other European countries (mostly in the UK, Benelux, Sweden, and Germany), making Estonia the country with the highest emigration rate in Europe. This is at least partly due to the easy access to oscillating migration to Finland.\n\nRecognising the problems arising from both low birth rate and high emigration, the country has launched various measures to both increase the birth rate and to lure migrant Estonians back to Estonia. Former president Toomas Hendrik Ilves has lent his support to the campaign \"Talendid koju!\" (\"Bringing talents home!\") which aims to coordinate and promote the return of Estonians who have particular skills needed in Estonia.\n\nOne of the largest permanent Estonian community outside Estonia is in Canada with about 24,000 people (according to some sources up to 50,000 people). In the late 1940s and early 1950s, about 17,000 arrived in Canada. Toronto is the city with the largest population of Estonians outside of Estonia. The first Estonian World Festival was held in Toronto in 1972. Some notable Estonian Canadians include Endel Tulving, Elmar Tamp√µld, Alison Pill, Uno Prii and Andreas Vaikla.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21088818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21088818", "title": "Gender separation in Judaism", "text": "Gender separation in Judaism\n\nIn Judaism, especially in Orthodox tradition, there are a number of settings in which men and women are kept separate in order to conform with various elements of halakha and to prevent men and women from mingling. Other forms of Judaism rarely separate genders any more than secular western society.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons in Judaism that are used to justify gender separation to varying degrees.\n\nIn Pirkei Avot 1:5, Yosi ben Yochanan says that a man who spends too much time talking to women, even his wife, neglects the study of Torah and will inherit gehinnom.\n\nChapter 152 of Kitzur Shulchan Aruch details a series of laws forbidding interaction between persons of the opposite sex who are not married or closely related. Some of the prohibitions include physical contact, isolation with members of the opposite sex, staring at women or any of their body parts or attire, or conversation for pleasure.\n\nDuring prayer services in Orthodox synagogues, seating is always separate. A mechitza is used to divide the men and women, and often to block the view from one section to the other.\n\nThe first mention of a Mechitza is in the context of the second temple itself, the temple contained an inner court and a Women's court. Separation was first instituted just for the once-a-year celebration of the annual ‚ÄúWater-Drawing Ceremony,‚Äù \"sim·∏•at beit hashoevah\", held on the second night of the autumn Sukkot festival. However, women regularly entered the Beit Hamikdash Holy area at all other times just as any Israelite man could to bring their personal sacrifices.\n\nSeparation of men and women also was established later within the Rabbinic Law, which established daily communal prayers binding to men only, and the central area of the synagogue was only allowed to be occupied by men as well. However during the early modern period, Moshe Rosman noted that, women began attending synagogue more often, which reflected on the changes to synagogue architecture. Changes that occurred to synagogue architecture included, the construction of the \"weibershule\"-separate rooms in which women conducted their own prayers, also \"erzot nashim\"‚Äì separate women's section in the synagogue, in which women prayer leaders mediated between the main services and the women's prayers, in a manner again very much determined by the initiatives of women. Today, some more liberal Orthodox congregations have enacted innovations allowing women a greater sense of participation, as long as they remain on their side of the Mechitza. Mechitza, are not only found in synagogues during prayer services, but in other aspects of Jewish life such as festivities, like weddings, lectures, concerts, and bar mitzvahs.\n\nConservative, Reform, and other types of synagogues generally do not have separate seating.\n\nWhile during the late 19th century, no formal segregation of men and women was to be found at the Wall, conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the World Union for Progressive Judaism were denied the right to host a mixed-gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the gender segregation customary at Orthodox places of worship. In recent years the Western Wall in Jerusalem has become a site of conflict and contention between liberal and feminist Jews. The Western Wall has been defended by the orthodox faith for generations, which is why many of the patriarchal traditions have been maintained such as gender segregation. Many orthodox Jews believe that in order to keep the sanctity of the wall proper gender roles must be adhered. Eventually a mechitza was set up at the wall to maintain and enforce gender separation, this caused conflict between the ultra orthodox Jews and the Arabs. The mechitza that was installed during the mid twentieth century it has a men's section and then a women's section which is half the size of the men's section. The progressives responded to these actions by the orthodox sector, by claiming that \"the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.\" In 1988, Women of the Wall launched a campaign for recognition of women's right to pray at the Wall in their fashion. Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were initially banned from holding services at the site. In response to the repeated arrests of women, including Anat Hoffman, trying to exercise their freedom of religion, the Jewish Agency observed 'the urgent need to reach a permanent solution and make the Western Wall once again a symbol of unity among the Jewish people, and not one of discord and strife.\" The Israeli high court finally affirmed in 2000 the right to have women pray at the wall according to their custom whether it be Reformed, Conservative, or Orthodox. This new law included the right for women to be able to pray aloud, read from the Torah, and wear a tallitot, the supreme court also recognized that the wall was \"owned\" by the orthodox sector, but felt that women had the right to pray how they wish. After the supreme court ruled upon this some ultra orthodox Jewish men tried to petition the court to criminalize women who read from the Torah, wore a tallitot, or blow shofar at the Wall. In 2003 this petition was looked at by the Israeli court and the court appealed the previously passed bill, the reasoning behind the repeal was because women praying at the wall would be a threat to public safety. The courts decision to once again limit women's rights at the Wall came from a place of fear, that if they did not limit their rights that there would be an uprising by the ultra orthodox sector. \n\nWomen of the Wall has also protested the fact that at Hanukkah every year a giant menorah is erected in the men‚Äôs section of the Western Wall and each night of the eight nights of the festival, male rabbis and male politicians are honored, while women are kept at a distance, where they are barely able to see the ceremony. At the Women of the Wall ceremony, women brought their personal menorahs. They invited Jews around the world to light a candle for WoW on the third night of Hanukkah. Western Wall rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, accused WoW of ulterior motives of trying to change the customs at the Wall. Responding to Rabinowitz' accusation, Anat Hoffman noted: \"Rabinowitz has never invited Women of the Wall or any other women to participate in the ceremonies or to be honored with the lighting of a candle at the Kotel on Hanukkah, despite the fact that women are obligated equally to men in this religious act.‚Äù In 2014 the personal menorahs the women brought to the Kotel were initially confiscated, but they were returned when police were called. \n\nAt many Orthodox weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs, seating at the ceremony and often the reception is separate, sometimes with a mechitza.\n\nIn Orthodox Judaism, many believe that men and women should not swim together. The laws prohibiting mixed bathing are derived from the laws of tzniut. This is due to concerns that bathing suits are inherently immodest, and do not meet \"tzniut\" requirements. In particular, a woman who comes dressed in a bathing suit to a pool is appearing publicly not meeting the requirements of tzniut, and a man who comes to a pool where women are dressed in bathing suits will inevitably see women dressed in this manner. Indeed, many pools within Jewish communities have separate hours for male and female swimming to accommodate those who follow this law.\n\nSome women following the laws of tzniut will wear a long T-shirt style dress over their bathing suit that meets tzniut requirements, considering this to be sufficient for swimming in the presence of men. Men, though, are more strict about the presence of immodestly-dressed women, due to concerns over the possibility of arousal.\n\nConservative, Reform, and other forms of Judaism do not have any restrictions on mixed swimming. Some Modern Orthodox Jews will also participate in mixed swimming.\n\nSome ultra-Orthodox communities enforce or attempt to enforce gender segregation on sidewalks. In New Square, N.Y., signs remain posted telling women to abide by modesty rules, and streets are strictly separated by gender, with women on the opposite side as men. In the Mea Shearim section of Jerusalem, some ultra-Orthodox Jews have also tried to segregate sidewalks.\n\nAt Kiryas Joel, a Hasidic community in New York, a public park was opened that included separate sections for boys and girls, with a great distance between. Rabbi Gedalia Segdin, the town's treasurer, announced the park would be under the scrutiny of the town \"Modesty Committee\" to ensure gender segregation. Yiddish signs distributed throughout the park making sure everyone kept to their specified section. Civil rights organizations protested gender segregation in a public space in New York.\n\nOrthodox Jews do not participate in mixed dancing, since dancing in most forms involves some contact between dancers.\n\nIn 2013, the Rabbinical Court of the Ashkenazi Community in the ultra-Orthodox settlement of Beitar Illit ruled against Zumba (a type of dance fitness) classes, although they were held with a female instructor and all-female participants. The Court said in part, \"both in form and manner, the activity [Zumba] is entirely at odds with both the ways of the Torah and the holiness of Israel, as are the songs associated to it.\" \n\nSome followers of Haredi Judaism have taken on the practice of separate seating while traveling. These range from abstaining to sitting adjacent to a member of the opposite sex, to having separate vehicles altogether.\n\nWhen Haredi have attempted to enforce gender segregation on public transportation such as buses and airlines, conflict with anti-discrimination laws have sometimes ensued. There have been complaints by airline passengers such as Renee Rabinowitz who have been subjected to Orthodox male passengers attempting to impose gender segregation on flights. The New York Times interviewed Anat Hoffman on the phenomenon on ultra-Orthodox males asking female passengers on airlines to move. IRAC had started a campaign urging women not to give up their seats. El Al airlines has future plans to fly single-gender flights for Haredi Jews following this practice. In 2017, the Jerusalem Magistrates Court ruled that employees of airlines could not request female passengers change their seats just because men wish them to.\n\nDuring the 1990s, members of the ultra Jewish orthodox sector began making requests for public transport services be compatible with what they claimed was the character of their community in Israel. This entailed the segregation of men and women on public transportation such as buses. When this movement first began private transport services emerged and began to cater to the Orthodox Jewish requests.Due to these new bus lines a new committee was instituted in the Ministry of Transportation and the committee was led by Nachum Langenthal. The Langenthal committee decided that segregation was to be voluntary and could be adhered by the ultra orthodox Jews, but it was not to be enforced. Though on city run buses it was not enforced the private buses could enforce these segregation rules, these buses were called mehadrin bus lines.\n\nBy 2010 there were approximately fifty public bus services designated as mehadrin, although this represented a small portion of the total public buses it allowed for tensions to grow between the orthodox community and the rest of the population. Private bus lines were established all across Israel which caused more issues to arise especially as sometimes that would be the only form of transportation in the area. Mehadrin bus lines became more prevalent in areas that had a high concentration of ultra orthodox communities. Due to the segregation rules the status of women became a direct issue in the Israeli community. Not only did the rest of the public have issues about the mehadrin buses, but because they were the only form of transportation in some communities the orthodox community began having issues with the overcrowding of the buses. When many of the buses became overcrowded, enforcing the segregation rules became harder and many of the ultra orthodox men complained about having to touch passengers of the opposite sex. \n\nWhen the mehadrin buses became more popular the Israeli women's network petitioned the high court arguing that the segregation policy on mehadrin lines discriminated against women.The Israeli Supreme Court denied the application of the Israel Women's Network on the grounds that the gender segregation on buses was supported by the religious community and should be respected. After the denial of the Israeli women's network, modesty guards began to appear on the buses, some super ultra orthodox men thought that they were responsible for enforcing the segregation rules and took it upon themselves to do so. In some cases women were forced off the bus or subjected to physical or verbal abuse when passengers were not appropriately dressed, or sitting near the front of the bus. Although a myriad of protests occurred to stop the segregation it was defended by many. The bus segregation was defended by rabbinic leaders and some members of the ultra-Orthodox community as intrinsic to the ultra-Orthodox way of life.\n\n"}

Whelchel's book recommends using only \"tiny\" amounts of hot sauce, and lists alternatives such as lemon juice or vinegar. \n\nThe practice had also been suggested in a 2001 article in \"Today's Christian Woman\" magazine, where only \"a drop\" is suggested, and alternative substances are listed.\n\nWhile these publications are credited with popularizing hot saucing, the practice is believed to come from Southern United States culture, where it is well-known among pediatricians, psychologists and child welfare professionals.\n\nIf a child is allergic to any of the ingredients in a hot sauce, it can cause swelling of the child's tongue and esophagus, presenting a choking hazard. \n\n"}

{"id": "30481435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30481435", "title": "Land grabbing", "text": "Land grabbing\n\nLand grabbing is the contentious issue of large-scale land acquisitions: the buying or leasing of large pieces of land by domestic and transnational companies, governments, and individuals. While used broadly throughout history, land grabbing as used in the 21st century primarily refers to large-scale land acquisitions following the 2007‚Äì08 world food price crisis. Obtaining water resources is usually critical to the land acquisitions, so it has also led to an associated trend of water grabbing. By prompting food security fears within the developed world and new found economic opportunities for agricultural investors, the food price crisis caused a dramatic spike in large-scale agricultural investments, primarily foreign, in the Global South for the purpose of industrial food and biofuels production. Although hailed by investors, economists and some developing countries as a new pathway towards agricultural development, investment in land in the 21st century has been criticized by some non-governmental organizations and commentators as having a negative impact on local communities. International law is implicated when attempting to regulate these transactions.\n\nThe term \"land grabbing\" is defined as very large-scale land acquisitions, either buying or leasing. The size of the land deal is multiples of or and thus much larger than in the past. The term is itself controversial. In 2011, Borras, Hall and others wrote that \"the phrase 'global land grab' has become a catch-all to describe and analyze the current trend towards scale (trans)national commercial land transactions.\" Ruth Hall wrote elsewhere that the \"term 'land grabbing', while effective as activist terminology, obscures vast differences in the legality, structure, and outcomes of commercial land deals and deflects attention from the roles of domestic elites and governments as partners, intermediaries, and beneficiaries.\"\n\nIn Portuguese, Land Grabbing is translated as \"grilagem\": \"Much is said about grilagem and the term may be curious ... document aged by the action of insects ... However, for those who live in the interior of the country, the expression effectively reveals a dark, heavy, violent meaning, involving abuses and arbitrary actions against the former occupants, occasionally with forced loss of possession by the taking of land \" The term grilagem applies to irregular procedures and / or illegal private landholding with violence in the countryside, exploitation of wealth, environmental damage and the threat to sovereignty, given their gigantic proportions.\n\nThe Overseas Development Institute reported in January 2013, that with limited data available in general and existing data associated with NGOs interested in generating media attention in particular, the scale of global land trade may have been exaggerated. They found the figures below provide a variety of estimates, all in the tens of millions of hectares.\n\nMost seem to arrive at a ballpark of 20-60 million hectares. Given that total global farmland takes up just over 4 billion hectares, these acquisitions could equate to around 1 per cent of global farmland. However, in practice, land acquired may not have previously been used as farmland, it may be covered by forests, which also equate to about 4 billion hectares worldwide, so transnational land acquisitions may have a significant role in ongoing deforestation.\n\nThe researchers thought that a sizeable number of deals remain questionable in terms of size and whether they have been finalised and implemented. The land database often relies on one or two media sources and may not track whether the investments take place, or whether the full quantity reported takes place. For example, a number of deals in the GRAIN database appear to have stalled including -\n\nThe researchers claim these are only those that have been checked, and already amount to nearly 10 per cent of the GRAIN database transnational land acquisitions. Deals are reported that use the estimate of the full extent of land that the firm expects to use. For example,\n\nThe researchers found that in terms of value of transnational land acquisitions, it is even harder to come across figures. Media reports usually just give information on the area and not on the value of the land transaction. Investment estimates, rather than the price of purchase are occasionally given\n\nThey found a number of reports in land databases are not acquisitions, but are long-term leases, where a fee is paid or a certain proportion of the produce goes to domestic markets. For example:\n\nThe estimated value has been calculated for IFPRI‚Äôs 2009 data to be 15 to 20 million hectares of farmland in developing countries, worth about $20 billion-$30 billion.\n\nResearchers discovered global investment funds are reported to have sizeable funds available for transnational land investments.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty around the value of transnational land acquisitions, particularly given leasing arrangements. Given the quantity of land and the size of investment funds operating in the area, it is likely that the value will be in the tens of billions of dollars.\n\nResearchers used the Land Portal‚Äôs Land Matrix database of 49 billion hectares of land deals, and found that Asia is a big centre of activity with Indonesia and Malaysia counting for a quarter of international deals by hectares. India contributes a further 10 per cent of land deals. The majority of investment is in the production of palm oil and other biofuels.\n\nThey determined that the Land Portal also reports investments made by investors within their home country and after stripping these out found only 26 million hectares of transnational land acquisitions which strips out a lot of the Asian investments. The largest destination countries include\nThey found the reason seems to be biofuels expansion with exceptions in Sudan and Ethiopia, which sees a trend towards growth of food from Middle Eastern and Indian investors. Represented in the media as the norm they seem to be more the exception.\n\nThe researchers found a mixed picture in terms of the origins of investors. According to the Land Portal, the United Kingdom is the biggest country of origin followed by the United States, India, the UAE, South Africa, Canada and Malaysia, with China a much smaller player. The GRAIN database says:\nBoth the Land Portal and the GRAIN database show that the UK and the US are major players in transnational land acquisitions. This is agribusiness firms, as well as investment funds, investing mostly in sugar cane, jatropha or palm oil. This trend has clearly been driven by the biofuels targets in the EU and US, and greater vertical integration in agribusiness in general.\n\nThe smaller trend is the picture of Middle Eastern investors or State-backed Chinese investments. While the UAE has done some significant deals by size, some driven by food deals, with Saudi Arabia a smaller number, this is not the dominant trend. While this aspect of land trade has gathered lots of media attention, it is not by any means a comprehensive story.\n\nOther estimates of the scope of land acquisition, published in September 2010 by the World Bank, showed that over or in large-scale farmland acquisitions or negotiations were announced between October 2008 and August 2009 alone, with two-thirds of demanded land concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the World Bank‚Äôs 464 examined acquisitions, only 203 included land area in their reports, implying that the actual total land covered could more than double the World Bank‚Äôs reported 46 million ha. The most recent estimate of the scale, based on evidence presented in April 2011 at an international conference convened by the Land Deal Politics Initiative, estimated the area of land deals at over 80 million ha.\n\nOf these deals, the median size is , with one-quarter over 200,000 ha and one-quarter under 10,000 ha. 37% of projects deal with food crops, 21% with cash crops, and 21% with biofuels. This points to the vast diversity of investors and projects involved with land acquisitions: the land sizes, crop types, and investors involved vary wildly between agreements. Of these projects, 30% were still in an exploratory stage, with 70% approved but in varying stages of development. 18% had not started yet, 30% were in initial development stages, and 21% had started farming. The strikingly low proportion of projects that had initiated farming signifies the difficulties inherent in large-scale agricultural production in the developing world.\n\nInvestment in land often takes the form of long-term leases, as opposed to outright purchases, of land. These leases often range between 25 and 99 years. Such leases are usually undertaken between national or district governments and investors. Because the majority of land in Africa is categorized as ‚Äúnon-private\" as a result of government policies on public land ownership and a lack of active titling, governments own or control most of the land that is available for purchase or lease. Purchases are much less common than leases due to a number of countries‚Äô constitutional bans on outright sales of land to foreigners.\n\nThe methods surrounding the negotiation, approval, and follow-up of contracts between investors and governments have attracted significant criticism for their opacity and complexity. The negotiation and approval processes have been closed in most cases, with little public disclosure both during and after the finalization of a deal. The approval process, in particular, can be cumbersome: It varies from approval by a simple district-level office to approval by multiple national-level government offices and is very subjective and discretionary. In Ethiopia, companies must first obtain an investment license from the central government, identify appropriate land on the district level and negotiate with local leaders, then develop a contract with the regional investment office. Afterwards, the government will undertake a project feasibility study and capital verification process, and finally a lease agreement will be signed and land will be transferred to the investor. In Tanzania, even though the Tanzania Investment Centre facilitates investments, an investor must obtain approval from the TIC, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Lands and Housing Development, and the Ministry of Environment, among which communication is oftentimes intermittent.\n\nOne common thread among governments has been the theme of development: Target governments tout the benefits of agricultural development, job creation, cash crop production, and infrastructure provision as drivers towards economic development and eventually modernization. Many companies have promised to build irrigation, roads, and in some cases hospitals and schools to carry out their investment projects. In return for a below-market-rate $10/ha annual payment for land, Saudi Star promised \"to bring clinics, schools, better roads and electricity supplies to Gambella.‚Äù Governments also count new job creation as a significant feature of land acquisitions.\n\nThe issue of agricultural development is a significant driving factor, within the larger umbrella of development, in target governments' agreement to investment by outsiders. The Ethiopian government's acceptance of cash crop-based land acquisitions reflects its belief that switching to cash crop production would be even more beneficial for food security than having local farmers produce crops by themselves. Implicit in the characterization of African agriculture as \"underdeveloped\" is the rejection of local communities' traditional methods of harvesting as an inadequate form of food production.\n\nOn a smaller scale, some deals can be traced to a personal stake in the project or possibly due to corruption or rent-seeking. Given the ad hoc, decentralized, and unorganized approval processes across countries for such transactions, the potential for lapses in governance and openings for corruption are extremely high. In many countries, the World Bank has noted that investors are often better off learning how to navigate the bureaucracies and potentially pay off corrupt officers of governments rather than developing viable, sustainable business plans.\n\nSince 2010 Brazil enforces in a stricter way a long-existing law that limits the size of farmland properties foreigners may purchase, having halted a large part of projected foreign land purchases.\n\nIn Argentina, as of September 2011, a projected law is discussed in parliament that would restrict the size of land foreign entities can acquire to 1000 hectare.\n\nInvestors can be generally broken down into three types: agribusinesses, governments, and speculative investors. Governments and companies in Gulf States have been very prominent along with East Asian companies. Many European- and American-owned investment vehicles and agricultural producers have initiated investments as well. These actors have been motivated by a number of factors, including cheap land, potential for improving agricultural production, and rising food and biofuel prices. Building on these motivations, investments can be broken down into three main categories: food, biofuel, and speculative investment. Forestry also contributes to a significant amount of large-scale land acquisition, as do several other processes: Zoomers mentions drivers such as the creation of protected areas and nature reserves, residential migration, large-scale tourist complexes and the creation of Special Economic Zones, particularly in Asian countries.\n\nFood-driven investments, which comprise roughly 37% of land investments worldwide, are undertaken primarily by two sets of actors: agribusinesses trying to expand their holdings and react to market incentives, and government-backed investments, especially from the Gulf states, as a result of fears surrounding national food security.\n\nAgricultural sector companies most often view investment in land as an opportunity to leverage their significant monetary resources and market access to take advantage of underused land, diversify their holdings, and vertically integrate their production systems. The World Bank identifies three areas in which multinational companies can leverage economies of scale: access to cheap international rather than domestic financial markets, risk-reducing diversification of holdings, and greater ability to address infrastructural roadblocks. In the past few decades, multinationals have shied away from direct involvement in relatively unprofitable primary production, instead focusing on inputs and processing and distribution. When the food price crisis hit, risk was transferred from primary production to the price-sensitive processing and distribution fields, and returns became concentrated in primary production. This has incentivized agribusinesses to vertically integrate to reduce supplier risk that has been heightened by the ongoing food price volatility. These companies hold mixed attitudes towards food imports and exports: While some concentrate on food exports, others focus on domestic markets first.\n\nWhile company-originated investments have originated from a wide range of countries, government-backed investments have originated primarily from the food-insecure Gulf States. Examples of such government-backed investments include the government of Qatar‚Äôs attempt to secure land in the Tana River Delta and the Saudi government's King Abdullah Initiative. Additionally, sovereign wealth funds acting as the investments arms of governments have initiated a number of agreements in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the population of the Gulf states is set to double from 30 million in 2000 to 60 million in 2030, their reliance on food imports is set to increase from the current level of 60% of consumption. The director general of the Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development echoed the sentiment of many Gulf leaders in proclaiming, ‚Äúthe whole Arab World needs of cereal, sugar, fodder and other essential foodstuffs could be met by Sudan alone.‚Äù\n\nBiofuel production, currently comprising 21% of total land investments, has played a significant, if at times unclear, role. The use and popularity of biofuels has grown over the past decade, corresponding with rising oil prices and increased environmental awareness. The total area under biofuel crops more than doubled between 2004 and 2008, expanding to 36 million ha by 2008. This rise in popularity culminated in EU Directive 2009/28/EC in April 2009, which set 10% mandatory targets for renewable energy use, primarily biofuels, out of the total consumption of fuel for transport, by 2020. Taken as a whole, the rise in biofuels popularity, while perhaps beneficial for the environment, sparked a chain reaction by making biofuels production a more attractive than food production and drawing land away from food to biofuel production.\n\nThe effect of the rise in popularity in biofuels was two-fold: first, demand for land for biofuel production became a primary driver of land sales in Sub-Saharan Africa; second, demand for biofuels production crowded out supply of traditional food crops worldwide. By crowding out food crops and forcing conversion of existing food-producing land to biofuels, biofuels production had a direct impact on the food supply/demand balance and consequently the food price crisis. One researcher from the IFPRI estimated that biofuels had accounted for 30 percent of the increase in weighted average grain prices.\n\nLarge-scale investments in land since 2007 have been scrutinized by civil society organizations, researchers, and other organizations because of issues such as land insecurity, local consultation and compensation for land, displacement of local peoples, employment of local people, the process of negotiations between investors and governments, and the environmental consequences of large-scale agriculture. These issues have contributed to critics' characterization of much large-scale investment since 2007 as \"land grabbing,\" irrespective of differences in the types of investments and the ultimate impact that investments have on local populations.\n\nOne of the major issues is land tenure: In a 2003 study, the World Bank estimated that only between 2 and 10 percent of total land in Africa is formally tenured. Much of the lack of private ownership is due to government ownership of land as a function of national policy, and also because of complicated procedures for registration of land and a perception by communities that customary systems are sufficient. World Bank researchers have found that there existed a strong negative statistical link between land tenure recognition and prospective land acquisitions, with a smaller yet still significant relationship for implemented projects as well. They concluded that ‚Äúlower recognition of land rights increased a country‚Äôs attractiveness for land acquisition,‚Äù implying that companies have actively sought out areas with low land recognition rights for investment.\n\nWhile commonly required by law in many host countries, the consultation process between investors and local populations have been criticized for not adequately informing communities of their rights, negotiating powers, and entitlements within land transactions.\n\nConsultations have been found extremely problematic due to the fact that they often reach just village chiefs but neglect common villagers and disenfranchised groups. World Bank researchers noted that ‚Äúa key finding from case studies is that communities were rarely aware of their rights and, even in cases where they were, lacked the ability to interact with investors or to explore ways to use their land more productively.‚Äù When consultations were even conducted, they often did not produce written agreements and were found to be superficial, glossing over environmental and social issues. In Ghana and elsewhere, chiefs often negotiated directly with investors without the input from other villagers, taking it upon themselves to sell common land or village land on their own. Moreover, investors often had obtained approval for their projects before beginning consultations, and lacked any contractual obligation to carry out promises made to villagers.\n\nThere is a knowledge gap between investors and local populations regarding the land acquisition process, the legal enforceability of promises made by investors, and other issues. The inability of villagers to see and study the laws and regulations around land sales severely deteriorates communities‚Äô agency in consultations. When consultations do occur with communities, some take place in spans of only two to three months, casting doubt on whether such short time frames can be considered as adequate consultation for such large, wide-reaching, and impactful events.\n\nAn additional concern with consultations is that women and underrepresented populations are often left outside during the process. Large-scale projects in Mozambique rarely included women in consultations and never presented official reports and documents for authorization by women. This holds true when women are the primary workers on the land that is to be leased out to companies. Meanwhile, pastoralists and internally displaced people were oftentimes intentionally excluded from negotiations, as investors tried to delegitimize their claims on land. This led to a lack of awareness on the part of these vulnerable groups until lease agreements have already been signed to transfer land. This oversight in consultations further disenfranchises previously overlooked communities and worsens power inequities in local villages.\n\nAnother criticism of investment in land is the potential for large-scale displacement of local peoples without adequate compensation, in either land or money. These displacements often result in resettlement in marginal lands, loss of livelihoods especially in the case of pastoralists, gender-specific erosion of social networks. Villagers were most often compensated as according to national guidelines for loss of land, loss of improvements over time on the land, and sometimes future harvests. However, compensation guidelines vary significantly between countries and depending on the types of projects undertaken. One study by the IIED concluded that guidelines for compensation given to displaced villagers in Ethiopia and Ghana was insufficient to restore livelihoods lost through dislocation.\n\nThere are a number of issues with the process of relocating locals to other areas where land is less fertile. In the process of relocation, often changed or lost are historical methods of farming, existing social ties, sources of income, and livelihoods. This holds drastic impacts especially in the case of women, who rely greatly upon such informal relationships.\n\nWhen not displaced, the conversion of local farmers into laborers holds numerous negative consequences for local populations. Most deals are based on the eventual formation of plantation-style farming, whereupon the investing company will own the land and employ locals as laborers in large-scale agricultural plots. The number of jobs created varies greatly dependent on commodity type and style of farming planned. In spite of this volatility, guarantees of job creation are rarely, if ever, addressed in contracts. This fact, combined with the intrinsic incentives towards mechanization in plantation-style production, can lead to much lower employment than originally planned for. When employed, locals are often paid little: In investments by Karuturi Global in Ethiopia, workers are paid on average under $2 a day, with a minimum wage of 8 birr, or $0.48, per day, both of which are under the World Bank poverty limit of $2 per day.\n\nIn addition to the lack of coordination between ministries, there is a wide knowledge gap between government-level offices and investors, leading to a rushed and superficial investment review. Many government agencies initially overwhelmed by the deluge of investment proposals failed to properly screen out non-viable proposals. Due to the knowledge gaps between government agencies and investors, ‚Äúin most countries it is implicitly presumed that investors will have the right incentive and be the best qualified to assess economic viability,‚Äù leading to a lack of reporting requirements or monitoring arrangements, key information on land uses and value of the investment, and checks on economic viability. The Sudanese government has been noted as having paid minimal attention to existing land rights and neglecting to conduct any economic analysis on potential projects. In addition, many countries, including Cambodia, Congo, Sudan, and Ghana, have neglected to catalog and file even general geographical descriptions of land allocation boundaries.\n\nOne addition to many contracts between governments and investors is a Stabilisation Clause, which insulates investors from the effect of changed governmental regulations. Such clauses severely restrict the government‚Äôs ability to change any regulations that would have a negative economic impact on the investment. While advantageous for businesses, these stabilization clauses would severely hinder the ability of governments to address possible social and/or environmental concerns that become apparent after the beginning of the project.\n\nLand investment has been criticized for its implicit endorsement of large-scale industrial agriculture, which relies heavily on costly machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, over smallholder agriculture. As foreign investors begin to develop the land, they will, for the most part, start a shift towards large-scale agriculture to improve upon existing ‚Äúunproductive‚Äù agricultural methods. The threat of the conversion of much of Africa‚Äôs land to such large-scale agriculture has provoked a severe pushback from many civil society organizations such as GRAIN, La Via Campesina, and other lobbyists for small-scale agriculture.\n\nForeign investors, through large-scale agriculture, increase the effectiveness of underused resources of land, labor, and water, while further providing additional market connections, large-scale infrastructure development, and provision of seeds, fertilizers, and technology. Proposed increases in production quantity, as touted by investors and hosts, are exemplified by Ethiopia‚Äôs Abera Deressa, who claims that ‚Äúforeign investors should help boost agricultural output by as much as 40%‚Äù throughout Ethiopia. However, large-scale mechanized agricultural production often entails the use of fertilizers and intensive farming techniques that have been criticized by numerous civil society actors as extremely ecologically detrimental and environmentally harmful over the long run. Over time, such intensive farming threatens to degrade the quality of topsoil and damage local waterways and ecosystems. As such, civil society actors have widely accused land investors for promoting ‚Äúnot agricultural development, much less rural development, but simply agribusiness development.‚Äù This trend towards large-scale agriculture that overrides local knowledge and sustainable local farming runs directly counter to the recent IAASTD report, backed by the FAO, UNDP, World Bank, and others, that to increase food security over the long term, sustainable peasant agriculture must be encouraged and supported.\n\nForeign investment in land has been criticized by many civil society actors and individuals as a new realization of neocolonialism, signifying a renewed economic imperialism of developed over developing nations. Critics have pointed to the acquisitions of large tracts of land for economic profit, with little perceived benefit for local populations or target nations as a whole, as a renewal of the economically exploitative practices of the colonial period.\n\nA 2013 report found no available literature giving recommendations for how the UK could change its laws and regulations to require UK companies investing in land in developing countries to report relevant data.\n\nThe researcher looks at a literature review by Global Witness, the Oakland Institute, and the International Land Coalition from 2012 which states that there is little sustained focus on the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises.\n\nThe researcher found most available literature and policy on transparency in land investment focusing on:\n\nHe found this focus was confirmed by a range of other documents reviewing address international efforts to promote responsible investment in agriculture and recommended the International Working Group paper\nand Smaller & Mann.\nThe researcher mentions a report by the International Institute for Sustainable Development stating a ‚Äòsignificant lack of concrete and verifiable‚Äô empirically-based policy and legal work on the issue of foreign investment in agricultural land\n\nThe researcher saw Smaller and Mann note that in many host states like the UK ‚Äòthere is either no, or insufficient or unclear domestic law concerning land rights, water rights, pollution controls for intensive agriculture, human health, worker protection and so on.\n\nThe researcher did find that international law framework provides hard rights for foreign investors with two primary sources of international law relating to this issue: international contracts, which are commercial in nature; and international treaty law on investment, with both bodies acting on a commercial perspective and focusing on economic interests of foreign investors, rather than social or environmental dimensions\n\nHe discussed the UN‚Äôs Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights which address the extraterritorial obligations of states over overseas business enterprises and finds the principles do not provide any detailed discussion of the UK case, or of timeframes and costs.\n\nThe researcher studied a report by Global Witness, the Oakland Institute and the International Land Coalition which identifies four key entry points for improving transparency in large-scale land acquisition:\n\nHe found the report stresses that ‚Äòfurther analysis is needed to identify the benefits and opportunities of each entry point, as well as potential limitations, challenges, and risks around future campaigns which would need to be addressed from the start‚Äô and notes that as of early 2013 there is a gap between the extent to which individual states fulfill their obligations to regulate businesses overseas, and ‚Äòthe extent to which such regulations cover transparency and information disclosure‚Äô\n\nThe researcher found that the UN‚Äôs Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, written by the former UN Special Representative to the Secretary General for Business and Human Rights, Professor John Ruggie provide some discussion of how business enterprises need to undertake human rights due diligence suggesting that states ‚Äòshould set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations‚Äô and notes that ‚Äòat present States are not generally required under international human rights law to regulate the extraterritorial activities of businesses domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction.\n\nHe claims that they are not generally prohibited from doing so either, provided there is a recognised jurisdictional basis‚Äô and says the report notes that some states have introduced domestic measures with extraterritorial implications. ‚ÄòExamples include requirements on ‚Äúparent‚Äù companies to report on the global operations of the entire enterprise; multilateral soft-law instruments such as the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; and performance standards required by institutions that support overseas investments.\n\nThe researcher found other approaches amount to direct extraterritorial legislation and enforcement including criminal regimes that allow for prosecutions based on the nationality of the perpetrator no matter where the offence occurs‚Äô\n\nHe read that the UN‚Äôs Guiding Principles propose that ‚Äòcontracts should always be publicly disclosed when the public interest is impacted; namely cases where the project presents either large-scale or significant social, economic, or environmental risks or opportunities, or involves the depletion of renewable or non-renewable natural resources‚Äô\n\nHe found Global Witness et al. state that governments and businesses often claim that confidentiality is necessarily to protect commercially sensitive information contained in investment contracts.\n\nThe researcher states that the Global Witness et al. paper details a number of international instruments that ‚Äòcreate obligations and responsibilities throughout all stages of decision-making around large-scale land investments‚Äô, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nHe found several thematic binding agreements also examined in the report: the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity and the 1994 Convention to Combat Desertification.\n\nThe UK encourages companies to abide by OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises which provide voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct for multinational corporations operating in or from countries adhering to the OECD Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises, including detailed guidance concerning information disclosure. However they do not, provide any specific recommendations on land.\n\nThe researcher read the Global Witness et al. report also finds that ‚Äòa number of instruments offer companies the opportunity to associate themselves with a set of principles or goals that demonstrate corporate social responsibility‚Äô but most of these are largely ‚Äòdeclarative‚Äô.\n\nOverall, he summaries that the report notes that although these various instruments ‚Äòrecognise secrecy and lack of access to information to be a problem, they give almost no detail as to how it should be tackled in practice, nor do any mandatory provisions yet exist to ensure such an implicit aspiration is met‚Äô\n\nIn a joint research project between the FAO, IIED, and IFAD, Cotula et al. found that the majority of host countries lacked basic data on the size, nature, and location of land acquisitions through land registries or other public sources, and that ‚Äúresearchers needed to make multiple contacts‚Ä¶to access even superficial and incomplete information.‚Äù The World Bank‚Äôs own lack of land size information on over half of the reported land grabs that it researched points to the difficulties inherent in gaining access to and researching individual land acquisitions.\n\nThe European project EJOLT (Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade) is building a global map of land grabbing, with the aim to make an interactive online map on this and many other environmental justice issue by 2013. The project also produces in-depth resources on land grabbing, such as this video on land grabbing in Ethiopia.\n\nIn Madagascar, the anger among the population about land sales led to violent protests. The South Korean corporation Daewoo was in the process of negotiations with the Malagasy government for the purchase of 1.3 million hectares, half of all agricultural land, to produce corn and palm oil. This investment, while one of many pursued in Madagascar, attracted considerable attention there and led to protests against the government.\n\nIn Sudan, numerous large-scale land acquisitions have taken place in spite of the country's unresolved political and security situation. One of the most prominent, involving a former GRAPE partner named Ilip Cybourg, garnered attention by playing in \"Rolling Stone\". Ilip, who is planning to invest in 800,000 ha of land in partnership with many of Sudan's top civilian officials, attracted criticism with his remarks (regarding Africa and land grabbing) that \"the whole place is like one big sewer ‚Äî and I'm like a plumber.\"\n\nList of land grabbings in hectares of involved EU countries in non-EU countries according to EU Land Matrix Data of 2016.\n\n"}

He credits David Landes and Harold Farberman as his mentors.\n\nBotstein became the youngest (or possibly second youngest) college president in U.S. history at age 23, serving from 1970 to 1975 at the now-defunct Franconia College, after which he was named president of Bard College.\nAs music director of the American Symphony Orchestra, Botstein emerged as a significant proponent of \"thematic programming,\" which attempts to assemble concert programs having a common theme grounded in literature, music history, or art. He also focused the ASO's programming on the performance of infrequently-performed works by major composers and the best examples of works by lesser-known composers, with a particular emphasis on U.S. premiere performances, many of which have been recorded by the ASO for the first time. In addition to the orchestra's main concert series at Carnegie Hall, Botstein inaugurated the Bard Music Festival with the participation of the ASO, a summer series which focuses on one composer each summer for an intensive series of concerts, lectures, and panel discussions. He also presents a series called \"Classics Declassified,\" devoting each program to a piece from the standard orchestral repertory. Botstein lectures about the piece for about an hour, using the orchestra to provide illustrations for his talk, then performs the entire piece, then opens the floor to questions from the audience directed at him and at members of the orchestra. This series, originally presented at Columbia University's Miller Theater, proved so popular that it was moved to Symphony Space for the 2007‚Äì2008 season. He also inaugurated an important series of recordings of neglected masterpieces with the Telarc label, using the ASO and a variety of European orchestras. In addition to his work with the ASO and JSO, Botstein has performed as a guest conductor with, among many others, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, New York City Opera, Los Angeles Philharmonic, BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, and NDR Symphony Orchestra. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called 2013's Los Angeles Philharmonic performance under Botstein \"the all-around most compelling performance of anything I've heard all summer at the Bowl.\" In fall 2013, Botstein also conducted the Sinf√≥nica Juvenil de Caracas in Venezuela and Japan, making him the first non-Venezuelan conductor invited by El Sistema to conduct on a tour. Many live recordings of his performances, including the prestigious operas performed every summer during the Bard SummerScape festival, are widely available on compact disc and on Internet sites such as iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify.\n\nBotstein's many books, essays, and articles on music and culture have earned him a reputation as a leading musicologist. His essays in the Princeton University Press series of books devoted to composers featured during the annual Bard Music Festival exemplify his efforts to address the complex social, political, and artistic influences and context of his subject. Of his recent essay in this series, on Jean Sibelius, the \"Times Literary Supplement\" wrote that Sibelius's \"critical reputation is epitomized by Leon Botstein.\" He has also written extensively about music and culture in 19th-century Vienna, Jewish European culture, and modernism. His book \"Judentum und Modernit√§t: Essays zur Rolle der Juden in der deutschen und √∂sterreichischen Kultur, 1848‚Äì1938\" was written in German and has been translated into Russian.\n\nBotstein's unique position as a leading music scholar, performer, and founder and coartistic director of the Bard Music Festival has enabled him to have an extraordinary impact on both music scholarship and performance. As the \"Wall Street Journal\"'s Barrymore Laurence Scherer observes, \"the Bard Music Festival‚Ä¶no longer needs an introduction. Under the provocative guidance of the conductor-scholar Leon Botstein, it has long been one of the most intellectually stimulating of all American summer festivals and frequently is one of the most musically satisfying. Each year, through discussions by major scholars and illustrative concerts often programmed to overflowing, Bard audiences have investigated the oeuvre of a major composer in the context of the society, politics, literature, art and music of his times.\"\n\nLeon Botstein is represented by Primavera Consulting.\n\nBotstein is the brother of biologist David Botstein and husband of art historian Barbara Haskell. Both of Botstein's parents were physicians.\n\n\nBotstein became Bard College's 14th and current president in 1975. Botstein, who is also Bard's Leon Levy Professor in the Arts and Humanities, has been a pioneer in linking the liberal arts and higher education to public secondary schools. In 1979, Botstein oversaw Bard's acquisition of Bard College at Simon's Rock, the oldest early college entrance program and the only accredited four-year early college to date. Along with administrators from Simon's Rock, he was instrumental in the founding of New York City's Bard High School Early College in 2001. During Botstein's 40-year tenure, one of the longest in the nation, Bard has established eight graduate schools, the Bard College Conservatory of Music, and the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College. With the purchase of the Montgomery Place estate to the south of the college in 2016, Bard's campus consists of nearly 1,000 park-like acres in the Hudson River Valley.\n\nBotstein has greatly extended Bard's reach internationally, leading the creation of new programs on several continents. In partnership with Saint Petersburg State University, Bard established in 1997 the first liberal arts college program in Russia, Smolny College, which offers dual degrees from Saint Petersburg State University and Bard. In 1998, the Institute for International Liberal Education (IILE) was formed at Bard to advance the theory and practice of international liberal arts education. Bard's other international programs include the Al-Quds Bard Partnership, a collaboration in Jerusalem between Bard College and Al-Quds University that was established in 2008 to improve the Palestinian education system; the International Human Rights Exchange (IHRE); the Program in International Education (PIE); Bard College Berlin: A Liberal Arts University; and joint programs with American University of Central Asia and Central European University.\n\nBotstein has also led Bard to become a regional and national leader in art and culture. In 1990, Bard opened the Center for Curatorial Studies and Art in Contemporary Culture, which includes the Hessel Museum of Art. In 1993, Bard opened the Bard Graduate Center: Decorative Arts, Design History, Material Culture in Manhattan. In 2003, the college opened the Frank Gehry-designed Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College, which houses two theaters, as well as dance and theater studios that provide rehearsal space for undergraduates. The Fisher Center is the home of the Bard Music Festival as well as Bard SummerScape, an annual festival of music, film, dance, and drama.\n\nIn February 2009, Botstein was accused by Joel Kovel of terminating Kovel from his position as professor at Bard in retaliation for the latter's political views, an accusation which Botstein denied.\n\nBotstein's written work includes \"Jefferson's Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture\", in which he argues that high school-level education after the tenth grade should be abolished in favor of a national early college system, as well as several other books in the fields of musicology and education. He is editor of The Musical Quarterly and a frequent contributor to periodicals focusing on music and education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some of these films are targeted at adults as well as teenagers. Teen films have been a trope of the cinema industry that started with Twilight. At this time, the film industry saw a greater market for teens with more disposable income and therefore more money to spend on leisure activities, largely going to films. Because of the boom in teen viewers, drive-in movie theaters were also very popular. However, even the silent era had teen films. Recently, online streaming services such as Netflix have created a resurgence in the \"tween\" and teenage-oriented film.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50871484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50871484", "title": "Literature in the other languages of Britain", "text": "Literature in the other languages of Britain\n\nIn addition to English, literature has been written in a wide variety of other languages in Britain, that is the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands (the Isle of Man and the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, but are closely associated with it, being British Crown Dependencies). This includes literature in Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Latin, Cornish, Anglo-Norman, Guern√©siais, J√®rriais, Manx, and Irish (but only in Northern Ireland after 1922). Literature in Anglo-Saxon (Old English) is treated as English literature and literature in Scots as Scottish literature.\n\nThe nature of British identity has changed over time. The island that contains England, Scotland, and Wales has been known as Britain from the time of the Roman Pliny the Elder (c. AD 23‚Äì79). Though the original inhabitants spoke mainly various Celtic languages, English as the national language had its beginnings with the Anglo-Saxon invasion of c.450 A.D.\n\nThe various constituent parts of the present United Kingdom joined at different times. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1542, and it was not until 1707 with a treaty between England and Scotland, that the Kingdom of England became the Kingdom of Great Britain. This merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Until fairly recent times Celtic languages were spoken in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland, and still survive, especially in parts of Wales\n\nSubsequently the impact of Irish nationalism led to the partition of the island of Ireland in 1921, which means that literature of the Republic of Ireland is not British, although literature from Northern Ireland, is both Irish and British. More recently the relationship between England and Wales and Scotland, has changed, through the establishment of parliaments in both those countries, in addition to the British parliament in London.\n\nLatin literature, mostly ecclesiastical, continued to be written in the centuries following the withdrawal of the Roman Empire at the beginning of the fifth-century, including Chronicles by Bede (672/3‚Äì735), \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\", and Gildas (c. 500‚Äì570), \"De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae\". \n\nVarious Celtic languages were spoken by many of British people at this time and among the most important written works that have survived are \"Y Gododdin\" i and the Mabinogion. \"Y Gododdin\" is a medieval Welsh poem consisting of a series of elegies to the men of the Britonnic kingdom of Gododdin and its allies who, according to the conventional interpretation, died fighting the Angles of Deira and Bernicia at a place named \"Catraeth\" in c. AD 600. It is traditionally ascribed to the bard Aneirin, and survives only in one manuscript, known as the Book of Aneirin. The name Mabinogion is a convenient label for a collection eleven prose stories collated from two medieval Welsh manuscripts known as the White book of Rhydderch (\"Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch\") (c. 1350) and the Red Book of Hergest (\"Llyfr Coch Hergest\") (1382‚Äì1410). They are written in Middle Welsh, the common literary language between the end of the eleventh century and the fourteenth century. They include the four tales that form Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi (\"The Four Branches of the Mabinogi\"). The tales draw on pre-Christian Celtic mythology, international folktale motifs, and early medieval historical traditions.\n\nFrom the 8th to the 15th centuries, Vikings and Norse settlers and their descendents colonised parts of what is now modern Scotland. Some Old Norse poetry survives relating to this period, including the \"Orkneyinga saga\" an historical narrative of the history of the Orkney Islands, from their capture by the Norwegian king in the ninth century onwards until about 1200.\n\nFollowing the Norman conquest in 1066, the Norman language became the language of England's nobility. During the whole of the 12th century the Anglo-Norman language (the variety of Norman used in England) shared with Latin the distinction of being the literary language of England, and it was in use at the court until the 14th century. It was not until the reign of Henry VII that English became the native tongue of the kings of England.\n\nWorks were still written in Latin and include Gerald of Wales's late-12th-century book on his beloved Wales, \"Itinerarium Cambriae\", and following the Norman Conquest of 1066, Anglo-Norman literature developed in the Anglo-Norman realm introducing literary trends from Continental Europe, such as the \"chanson de geste\". However, the indigenous development of Anglo-Norman literature was precocious in comparison to continental O√Øl literature.\n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth was one of the major figures in the development of British history and the popularity for the tales of King Arthur. He is best known for his chronicle \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (History of the Kings of Britain) of 1136, which spread Celtic motifs to a wider audience. Wace (c. 1110 ‚Äì after 1174), who wrote in Norman-French, is the earliest known poet from Jersey, also developed the Arthurian legend.) At the end of the 12th century, Layamon in \"Brut\" adapted Wace to make the first English language work to use the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. \n\nEarly English Jewish literature developed after the Norman Conquest with Jewish settlement in England. Berechiah ha-Nakdan is known chiefly as the author of a 13th-century set of over a hundred fables, called \"Mishle Shualim\", (Fox Fables). The development of Jewish literature in mediaeval England ended with the Edict of Expulsion of 1290.\n\nThe multilingual nature of the audience for literature in the 14th century can be illustrated by the example of John Gower (c. 1330 ‚Äì October 1408). A contemporary of William Langland and a personal friend of Geoffrey Chaucer, Gower is remembered primarily for three major works, the \"Mirroir de l'Omme\", \"Vox Clamantis\", and \"Confessio Amantis\", three long poems written in Anglo-Norman, Latin and, Middle English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes.\n\nDafydd ap Gwilym (c. 1315/1320 ‚Äì c. 1350/1370), is widely regarded as the leading Welsh poet and amongst the great poets of Europe in the Middle Ages. His main themes are love and nature. The influence of the ideas of courtly love, found in the troubadour poetry of Proven√ßal, was a significant influence on his poetry.\n\nMajor Scottish writers from the 15th century include Henrysoun, Dunbar, Douglas and Lyndsay, wrote in Middle Scots, often simply called English, the dominant language of Scotland.\n\nIn the Cornish language \"Passhyon agan Arloedh\" (\"The Passion of our Lord\"), a poem of 259 eight-line verses written in 1375, is one of the earliest surviving works of Cornish literature. The most important work of literature surviving from the Middle Cornish period is \"An Ordinale Kernewek\" (\"The Cornish Ordinalia\"), a 9000-line religious drama composed around the year 1400. Three plays in Cornish known as the Ordinalia have survived from this period.\n\nThe spread of printing affected the transmission of literature across Britain and Ireland. The first book printed in English, William Caxton's own translation of \"Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye\", was printed abroad in 1473, to be followed by the establishment of the first printing press in England in 1474. The establishment of a printing press in Scotland under royal patent from James IV in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature. The first printing press in Ireland followed later in 1551. Although the first book in Welsh to be printed was produced by John Prise in 1546, restrictions on printing meant that only clandestine presses, such as that of Robert Gwyn who published \"Y Drych Cristionogawl\" in 1586/1587, could operate in Wales until 1695. The first legal printing press to be set up in Wales was in 1718 by Isaac Carter. The first printed work in Manx dates from 1707: a translation of a Prayer Book catechism in English by Bishop Thomas Wilson. Printing arrived even later in other parts of Britain and Ireland: the first printing press in Jersey was set up by Mathieu Alexandre in 1784. The earliest datable text in Manx (preserved in 18th-century manuscripts), a poetic history of the Isle of Man from the introduction of Christianity, dates to the 16th century at the latest.\n\nThe reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England (1558‚Äì1603) and of King James I (1603‚Äì162) (James VI of Scotland), saw the development of Britishness in literature. In anticipation of James VI's expected inheritance of the English throne, court masques in England were already developing the new literary imagery of a united \"Great Britain\", sometimes delving into Roman and Celtic sources. William Camden's \"Britannia\", a county by county description of Great Britain and Ireland, was an influential work of chorography: a study relating landscape, geography, antiquarianism, and history. Britannia came to be viewed as the personification of Britain, in imagery that developed during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe Renaissance in Wales was marked by humanism and scholarship. The Welsh language, its grammar and lexicography, was studied for the first time and biblical studies flourished. Welsh writers such as John Owen and William Vaughan wrote in Latin or English to communicate their ideas outside Wales, but the humanists were unsuccessful in opening the established practices of professional Welsh poets to Renaissance influences. From the Reformation until the 19th century most literature in the Welsh language was religious in character. Morgan Llwyd's \"Llyfr y Tri Aderyn\" (\"The Book of the Three Birds\") (1653) took the form of a dialogue between an eagle (representing secular authority, particularly Cromwell); a dove (representing the Puritans); and a raven (representing the Anglican establishment).\n\nAt the Reformation, the translation of liturgy and Bible into vernacular languages provided new literary models. The \"Book of Common Prayer\" and the \"Authorized King James Version\" of the Bible have been hugely influential. The King James Bible, one of the biggest translation projects in the history of English up to this time, was started in 1604 and completed in 1611. \n\nThe earliest surviving examples of Cornish prose are \"Pregothow Treger\" (The Tregear Homilies), a set of 66 sermons translated from English by John Tregear 1555‚Äì1557.\n\nIn 1567 William Salesbury's Welsh translations of the New Testament and Book of Common prayer were published. William Morgan's translation of the whole Bible followed in 1588 and remained the standard Welsh Bible until well into the 20th century.\n\nThe first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by Nicholas Walsh, Bishop of Ossory, continued by John Kearney (Treasurer of St Patrick's, Dublin), his assistant, and Dr. Nehemiah Donellan, Archbishop of Tuam, and finally completed by William O'Domhnuill (William Daniell, Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602. The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by William Bedell (1571‚Äì1642), Bishop of Kilmore, who completed his translation within the reign of Charles the First. However, it was not published until 1685, in a revised version by Narcissus Marsh (1638‚Äì1713), Archbishop of Dublin.\n\nThe \"Book of Common Order\" was translated into Scottish Gaelic by S√©on Carsuel (John Carswell), Bishop of the Isles, and printed in 1567. This is considered the first printed book in Scottish Gaelic though the language resembles classical Irish. The Irish translation of the Bible dating from the Elizabethan period was in use in Scotland until the Bible was translated into Scottish Gaelic. James Kirkwood (1650‚Äì1709) promoted Gaelic education and attempted to provide a version of William Bedell's Bible translations into Irish, edited by his friend Robert Kirk (1644‚Äì1692), which failed, though he did succeed in publishing a Psalter in Gaelic (1684).\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer was translated into French by Jerseyman Jean Durel, later Dean of Windsor, and published for use in the Channel Islands in 1663 as Anglicanism was established as the state religion after the Stuart Restoration.\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer and Bible were translated into Manx in the 17th and 18th centuries. The printing of \"prayers for the poor families\" was projected by Thomas Wilson in a memorandum of Whit-Sunday 1699, but was not carried out until 30 May 1707, the date of issue of his \"Principles and Duties of Christianity ... in English and Manks, with short and plain directions and prayers\", 1707. This was the first book published in Manx, and is often styled the \"Manx Catechism\". \"The Gospel of St. Matthew\" was translated, with the help of his vicars-general in 1722 and published in 1748 under the sponsorship of his successor as bishop, Mark Hildesley. The remaining Gospels and the Acts were also translated into Manx under his supervision, but not published. Hildesley printed the New Testament and the Book of Common Prayer, translated, under his direction, by the clergy of the diocese, and the Old Testament was finished and transcribed in December 1772, at the time of the bishop's death. The Manx Bible established a standard for written Manx. A tradition of Manx \"carvals\", religious songs or carols, developed. Religious literature was common, but secular writing much rarer.\n\nTranslations of parts of the Bible into Cornish have existed since the 17th century. The early works involved the translation of individual passages, chapters or books of the Bible\n\nLatin continued in use as a language of learning, long after the Reformation had established the vernacular as the liturgical language. In Scotland, Latin as a literary language thrived into the 17th century as Scottish writers writing in Latin were able to engage with their audiences on an equal basis in a prestige language without feeling hampered by their less confident handling of English.\n\n\"Utopia\" is a work of fiction and political philosophy by Thomas More (1478‚Äì1535) published in 1516. The book, written in Latin, is a frame narrative primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious, social and political customs. \"New Atlantis\" is a utopian novel by Sir Francis Bacon (1561‚Äì1626), published in Latin (as \"Nova Atlantis\") in 1624 and in English in 1627. In this work, Bacon portrayed a vision of the future of human discovery and knowledge, expressing his aspirations and ideals for humankind. The novel depicts the creation of a utopian land where \"generosity and enlightenment, dignity and splendour, piety and public spirit\" are the commonly held qualities of the inhabitants of the mythical Bensalem. The plan and organisation of his ideal college, Salomon's House (or Solomon's House), envisioned the modern research university in both applied and pure sciences.\n\nScotsman George Buchanan (1506‚Äì1582) was the Renaissance writer from Britain (and Ireland) who had the greatest international reputation, being considered the finest Latin poet since classical times. As he wrote mostly in Latin, his works travelled across Europe as did he himself. His Latin paraphrases of the Hebrew Psalms (composed while Buchanan was imprisoned by the Inquisition in Portugal) remained in print for centuries and were used into the 19th century for the purposes of studying Latin\nAmongst English poets who wrote poems in Latin in the 17th century were George Herbert (1593‚Äì1633) (who also wrote poems in Greek), and John Milton (1608‚Äì74).\n\nPhilosopher Thomas Hobbes' \"Elementa Philosophica de Cive\" (1642‚Äì1658) was in Latin. However, things were changing and by about 1700 the growing movement for the use of national languages (already found earlier in literature and the Protestant religious movement) had reached academia, and an example of the transition is Isaac Newton's writing career, which began in New Latin and ended in English: \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" in Latin \"Opticks\", 1704, in English.\n\nIain Lom (c. 1624 ‚Äì c. 1710) was a Royalist Scottish Gaelic poet appointed poet laureate in Scotland by Charles II at the Restoration. He delivered a eulogy for the coronation, and remained loyal to the Stuarts after 1688, opposing the Williamites and later, in his vituperative \"Oran an Aghaidh an Aonaidh\", the 1707 Union of the Parliaments. \n\n\"C√≠n Lae U√≠ Mheall√°in\" is an account of the Irish Confederate Wars which \"reflected the Ulster Catholic point of view\" written by Tarlach √ì Meall√°in. \n\nNicholas Boson (1624‚Äì1708) wrote three significant texts in Cornish, \"Nebbaz gerriau dro tho Carnoack\" (A Few Words about Cornish) between 1675 and 1708; \"Jowan Chy-an-Horth, py, An try foynt a skyans\" (John of Chyannor, or, The three points of wisdom), published by Edward Lhuyd in 1707, though written earlier; and \"The Dutchess of Cornwall's Progress\", partly in English, now known only in fragments. The first two are the only known surviving Cornish prose texts from the 17th century.\n\nIn Scotland, after the 17th century, anglicisation increased, though Lowland Scots was still spoken by the vast majority of the population, and Scottish Gaelic by a minority. At the time, many of the oral ballads from the borders and the North East were written down. The 17th century probably also saw the composition in Orkney of the only original literary work in the Norn language, a ballad called \"Hildina\". Writers of the period include Robert Sempill (c. 1595 ‚Äì 1665), Lady Wardlaw and Lady Grizel Baillie.\n\nThe Union of the Parliaments of Scotland and England in 1707 to form a single Kingdom of Great Britain and the creation of a joint state by the Acts of Union had little impact on the literature of England nor on national consciousness among English writers. The situation in Scotland was different: the desire to maintain a cultural identity while partaking of the advantages offered by the English literary market and English literary standard language led to what has been described as the \"invention of British literature\" by Scottish writers. English writers, if they considered Britain at all, tended to assume it was merely England writ large; Scottish writers were more clearly aware of the new state as a \"cultural amalgam comprising more than just England\".\n\nEllis Wynne's \"Gweledigaetheu y Bardd Cwsc\" ('Visions of the Sleeping Bard'), first published in London in 1703, is regarded as a Welsh language classic. It is generally said that no better model exists of such 'pure' idiomatic Welsh, before writers had become influenced by English style and method.\n\nA mover in the classical revival of Welsh literature in the 18th century was Lewis Morris, one of the founders in 1751 of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, a Welsh literary society in London‚Äîat that time the most important centre of Welsh publishing. He set out to counter the trend among patrons of Welsh literature to turn towards English culture. He attempted to recreate a classic school of Welsh poetry with his support for Goronwy Owen and other Augustans. Goronwy Owen's plans for a Miltonic epic were never achieved, but influenced the aims of eisteddfodau competitions through the 19th century.\n\nThe Scottish Gaelic Enlightenment figure Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair compiled the first secular book in Scottish Gaelic to be printed: \"Leabhar a Theagasc Ainminnin\" (1741), a Gaelic-English glossary. The second secular book in Scottish Gaelic to be published was his poetry collection \"Ais-Eiridh na Sean Ch√°noin Albannaich\" (The Resurrection of the Ancient Scottish Language). Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair was the most overtly nationalist poet in Gaelic of the 18th century. He was influenced by James Thomson's \"The Seasons\" as well as by Gaelic \"village poets\" such as Iain Mac Fhearchair (John MacCodrum). As part of the oral literature of the Highlands, few of the works of such village poets were published at the time, although some have been collected since.\n\nScottish Gaelic poets produced laments on the Jacobite defeats of 1715 and 1745. Mairghread nighean Lachlainn and Catriona Nic Fhearghais are among woman poets who reflected on the crushing effects on traditional Gaelic culture of the aftermath of the Jacobite uprisings. A consequent sense of desolation pervaded the works of Scottish Gaelic writers such as Dughall Bochanan which mirrored many of the themes of the graveyard poets writing in England. A legacy of Jacobite verse was later compiled (and adapted) by James Hogg in his \"Jacobite Reliques\" (1819).\n\nIn the Scots-speaking areas of Ulster there was traditionally a considerable demand for the work of Scottish poets, often in locally printed editions. These included Alexander Montgomerie's \"The Cherrie and the Slae\" in 1700, over a decade later an edition of poems by Sir David Lindsay, and nine printings of Allan Ramsay's \"The Gentle shepherd\" between 1743 and 1793.\n\nThe Welsh novel in English starts with \"\"The Adventures and Vagaries of Twm Shon Catti\" (1828) by T. J. Ll. Prichard, and novelists following him developed two important genres: the industrial novel and the rural romance. Serial fiction in Welsh had been appearing from 1822 onwards, but the work to be recognisable as the first novel in Welsh was William Ellis Jones' 1830 \"Y Bardd, neu y Meudwy Cymreig\"\". This was a moralistic work, as were many of the productions of the time. The first major novelist in the Welsh language was Daniel Owen (1836‚Äì1895), author of works such as \"Rhys Lewis\" (1885) and \"Enoc Huws\" (1891).\n\nThe first novel in Scottish Gaelic was John MacCormick's \"D√πn-√Äluinn, no an t-Oighre 'na Dh√¨obarach\", which was serialised in the \"People's Journal\" in 1910, before publication in book form in 1912. The publication of a second Scottish Gaelic novel, \"An t-Ogha M√≤r\" by Angus Robertson, followed within a year.\n\nPhilippe Le Sueur Mourant's J√®rriais tales of Bram Bilo, an innocent abroad in Paris, were an immediate success in Jersey in 1889 and went through a number of reprintings.\n\nEwen MacLachlan (Gaelic: Eoghan MacLachlainn) (1775‚Äì1822) was a Scots poet of this period who translated the first eight books of Homer's Iliad into Scottish Gaelic. He also composed and published his own \"Gaelic Attempts in Verse\" (1807) and \"Metrical Effusions\" (1816), and contributed greatly to the 1828 Gaelic‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary.\n\nDenys Corbet published collections of Guern√©siais poems \"Les Feuilles de la For√™t\" (1871) and \"Les Ch√†nts du dra√Øn rimeux\" (1884), and also brought out an annual poetry anthology 1874‚Äì1877, similar to Augustus Asplet Le Gros's annual in Jersey 1868‚Äì1875. \nIncreased literacy in rural and outlying areas and wider access to publishing through, for example, local newspapers encouraged regional literary development as the 19th century progressed. Some writers in lesser-used languages and dialects of the islands gained a literary following outside their native regions, for example William Barnes (1801‚Äì86) in Dorset, George M√©tivier (1790‚Äì1881) in Guernsey and Robert Pipon Marett (1820‚Äì84) in Jersey. \n\nGeorge M√©tivier published \"Rimes Guernesiaises\", a collection of poems in Guern√©siais and French in 1831 and \"Fantaisies Guernesiaises\" in 1866. M√©tivier's poems had first appeared in newspapers from 1813 onward, but he spent time in Scotland in his youth where he became familiar with the Scots literary tradition although he was also influenced by Occitan literature. The first printed anthology of J√®rriais poetry, \"Rimes Jersiaises\", was published in 1865.\n\nThe so-called \"Cranken Rhyme\" produced by John Davey of Boswednack, one of the last people with some traditional knowledge of the language, may be the last piece of traditional Cornish literature.\n\nJohn Ceiriog Hughes desired to restore simplicity of diction and emotional sincerity and do for Welsh poetry what Wordsworth and Coleridge did for English poetry.\n\nEdward Faragher (1831‚Äì1908) has been considered the last important native writer of Manx. He wrote poetry, reminiscences of his life as a fisherman, and translations of selected Aesop's Fables.\n\nThe development of Irish literary culture was encouraged in the late 19th and early 20th century by the Irish Literary Revival (see also The Celtic Revival), which was supported by William Butler Yeats (1865‚Äì1939), Augusta, Lady Gregory, and John Millington Synge. The Revival stimulated a new appreciation of traditional Irish literature. This was a nationalist movement that also encouraged the creation of works written in the spirit of Irish, as distinct from British culture. While drama was an important component of this movement, it also included prose and poetry.\n\nD√≤mhnall Ruadh Chor√πna was a Scottish Gaelic poet who served in the First World War, and as a war poet described the use of poison gas in his poem \"√íran a' Phuinnsuin\" (\"Song of the Poison\"), but is perhaps most widely known for his love poem \"An Eala Bh√†n\" (\"The White Swan\"). Welsh poet Hedd Wyn, who was killed in World War I although producing comparatively few war poems as such, was later the subject of an Oscar-nominated Welsh film. \"In Parenthesis\", an epic poem by David Jones first published in 1937, is a notable work of the literature of the First World War, that was influenced by Welsh traditions, despite Jones being born in England. Poetry reflecting life on the home-front was also published; Guern√©siais writer Thomas Henry Mahy's collection \"Dires et Pens√©es du Courtil Poussin\", published in 1922, contained some of his observational poems published in \"La Gazette de Guernesey\" during the war.\n\nIn the late 19th century and early twentieth-century, Welsh literature began to reflect the way the Welsh language was increasingly becoming a political symbol. Two important literary nationalists were Saunders Lewis (1893‚Äì1985) and Kate Roberts (1891‚Äì1985), both of whom began publishing in the 1920s. Kate Roberts' and Saunders Lewis's careers continued after World War II and they both were among the foremost Welsh-language authors of the twentieth century.\n\nThe year 1922 marked a significant change in the relationship between Great Britain and Ireland, with the setting up of the Irish Free State in the predominantly Catholic South, while the predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom. Nationalist movements in Britain, especially in Wales and Scotland, also significantly influenced writers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Referenda held in Wales and in Scotland eventually resulted in the establishment of a form of self-government in both countries.\n\nThe Scottish Gaelic Renaissance (Scottish Gaelic: \"Ath-Bhe√≤thachadh na G√†idhlig\") is a continuing movement concerning the revival of the Scottish Gaelic language. Although the Scottish Gaelic language had been facing gradual decline in the number of speakers since the late 19th century, the number of young fluent Gaelic speakers is rising due to Gaelic-medium education. The movement has its origins in the Scottish Renaissance, especially in the work of Sorley MacLean, George Campbell Hay, Derick Thomson and Iain Crichton Smith. Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig is sometimes seen as being a product of this renaissance. Although many of the products of the Renaissance are in poetry, or in traditional music, many such as MacLean and Iain Crichton Smith, and more recently Aonghas MacNeacail have blended these with modern international styles.\n\nContemporary writers in Scottish Gaelic include Aonghas MacNeacail, and Angus Peter Campbell who, besides two Scottish Gaelic poetry collections, has produced two Gaelic novels: \"An Oidhche Mus Do Sheol Sinn\" (2003) and \"L√† a' Deanamh Sgeil Do L√†\" (2004). A collection of short stories \"P'tites Lures Guern√©siaises\" (in Guern√©siais with parallel English translation) by various writers was published in 2006. In March 2006 Brian Stowell's \"Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley\" (\"The vampire murders\") was published‚Äîthe first full-length novel in Manx. There is some production of modern literature in Irish in Northern Ireland. Performance poet Gear√≥id Mac Lochlainn exploits the creative possibilities for poetry of \"creolised Irish\" in Belfast speech.\n\nThe theatrical landscape has been reconfigured, moving from a single national theatre at the end of the twentieth-century to four as a result of the devolution of cultural policy.\n\nWith the revival of Cornish there have been newer works written in the language. The first full translation of the Bible into Cornish was published in 2011.\n\n"}

Most of Malaysian Telugus today are 4th or 5th generation who migrated during the colonial period. While most of current Malaysian Telugu ancestors originated from what is now Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (then known as Madras state), substantial number of them originated from area of Orissa and Bengal state. While most Telugus come to Malaysia as labourers, some were professionals and traders who arrived as refugees. In 1930s anti Indian riots in Burma results in large number of ethnic Telugus fleeing from Burma either back to India, Thailand or Malaya. Another wave of Telugu migration from Burma occurs during world war two, when Japanese invaded Burma.\n\nIn recent years new wave of migration of Telugu speaking population from India results in some rejuvenation of Telugu linguistic interest in Malaysia.\nIn 1981 the World Second Telugu Conference was held in Kuala Lumpur. Telugu Association of Malaysia, a non profit NGO serves as representative of Malaysian Telugus and is platform for Telugus to voice their opinions. The Telugu Association was first formed in the region of Lower Perak District in Malaysia on 17 July 1955, under the banner of Malaya Andhra Sangamu and officially registered on 17 February 1956. On 16 December 1963 it was renamed as Malaysia Andhra Sangamu. The association name evolved from 1983 onwards as Telugu Association of Malaysia (TAM) which is also known as Malaysia Telugu Sangamu. The association is formally registered and operates under the banner of as Persatuan Telugu Malaysia in Bahasa Malaysia.\n\nTelugus along with other Indians from the east coast of India and the Bengal Bay arrived to the shores of ancient \"Suvarnabhumi\" (referring to Malay Peninsula and Lower Burma, meaning \"Land of Gold\" in Telugu language) and other parts of Southeast Asia. Indians from Godavari basin arrived in ancient Malay peninsular, trading and settling down, thus influencing local customs and culture. \"Sejarah Melayu\" addressed India as Benua Keling and Indians as \"Keling\", a word taken from Kalinga, an ancient Indian kingdom which is likely the source of Indian influence over Southeast Asia. Kalinga is located at the northern part of Andhra Pradesh covering Godavari basin and the southern part of Orissa and people of this region now speak either Telugu or Oriya. \n\nThe current population of Malaysian Telugus are mostly third and fourth generation Telugus who descended from indentured laborers under the kangani system who arrived in the 19th and early 20th century. Some also paid their own passage after the Kangani system ended in the early 20th century. Most of the Telugus migrants to the Malay peninsula during the colonial era were from northern coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh, often recruited by \"maistries\" or \"kanganis\" (foremen) from the Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam regions, with some from the East Godavari and Chittoor regions. The migrants usually shared the same neighbourhood background, blood ties or caste connections. Telugus who arrived during British colonial era were mainly non-Brahmin middle-ranking or low caste Hindus from the Kamma and Reddy to the untouchables, and included the Gavara, Kapu, and Velama, with some from the Chakali, Mangali (barber) and others castes. While the Indian immigrants in the early period were predominantly men, the Telugus were more willing to bring with them their womenfolk. The Telugus were most commonly found in the rubber and coconut plantations in Perak (such as Telok Anson), Johor, and Kedah.\n\nAs the Telugus formed only a small minority of Indians in British Malaya with Tamils the great majority, they weren't particularly visible as a group and thus their identity was subsumed into the larger group of South Indians. They were referred to as Klings or Madrasis used as general terms for South Indians. In 1955, the Malaya Andhra Sanghamu (later Malaysia Andhra Sanghamu) was formed to support the Telugu community, foster their culture and promote their language.\n\nMore recently, an increasing number of Telugu expatriates have arrived from India.\n\nThe Malaysian Telugus form the third largest group of Indians in Malaysia. In British Malaya they formed around 4% of the Indian population. As the early Telugu migrants tended to bring their womenfolk with them, they had the highest sex ratio among Indian migrants with 1.5 males to 1 female according to the 1921 census. The Telugu population is estimated to be 118,000 in 2018.\n\nTelugu language is the native language of Malaysian Telugus, It is the world's most spoken Dravidian and it comes under the category of \"South Central Dravidian\" language family. Until late 1980s there were few primary Telugu medium schools. These schools were poorly maintained and there were support by the estate owners only. The last of Telugu school were closed in 1990 due to socioeconomic reasons and urbanization of Telugu people .There was no Indian political party in Malaysia to voice out Telugu people concerns. Some Telugus (along with other Indian minority groups) also had start adopting and assimilating into the majority Tamil language and culture due to tamil dominance. There was resurgence in learning Telugu language following political and financial support from the Malaysian government .There was a increase in students enrollment in Telugu classes conducted by Telugu Association of Malaysia with partial financial support from government of Malaysia. Today there are more than 5000 new generation of students who can read and write in Telugu language.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5000516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5000516", "title": "Mommy track", "text": "Mommy track\n\nA mommy track is a path in a woman's life that puts priority to being a mother. It can also specifically refer to work arrangements for women in the workforce that facilitate motherhood, such as flexible hours, but at the same time usually provides fewer opportunities for career advancement. References to the mommy track often go along with being a housewife, \"opting out\" of the workforce, temporarily or even permanently. Women following the mommy track may be contrasted to career women who prioritize their careers more than having children.\n\nWriter Jennifer A. Kingson introduced the term \"mommy track\" in an August 8, 1988, article in The New York Times, in which she described the career hurdles faced by law firm associates who sacrificed advancement potential once they had children.\n\nFelice Schwartz‚Äôs 1989 article in the \"Harvard Business Journal\" is sometimes called the first discussion of the mommy track phenomenon. Schwartz claims in the article that while ‚Äúthe cost of employing women in management is greater than the cost of employing men,‚Äù this greater cost is due primarily to gendered expectations of the workplace and women‚Äôs duties in raising children. Schwartz wrote:\nSchwartz's assertions generated widespread publicity and a new conversation about women in the workplace. \"The New York Times,\" having coined the term in 1988, described \"mommy track\" in greater detail in a March 8, 1989 article, \"Mommy Career Track Sets Off Furor\" which discussed Schwartz's article and the response to it in the public sphere. The article described the mommy track as a phenomenon \"in which women with family responsibilities are shunted into dead-end, lower-paying jobs.\"\n\nAcross different pay levels and socioeconomic groups, women‚Äôs earnings tend to plateau after giving birth. Even when controlling for variables, on average mothers in all groups earn lower wages than non-mothers. Beyond this general drop in earnings, though, there are significant differences in mothers‚Äô wage gaps between high-earning women and low-earning women.\n\nHigh-earning women appear to bear much higher costs of childbirth than low-earning women. In the US, choosing to have children will force a woman to give up 21 to 33 percent of her lifetime earnings, a loss that could cost up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ten years after having children, a highly skilled woman with children remains at a pay level 24% lower than non-mothers even when time out of the workforce is taken into account. This group of women also seems to face greater discrimination within the workplace; only 16% of all law firm partners are women, a discrepancy absent from lower-skilled professions. Higher-skilled women tend to have flatter wage-earning trajectories than their low-skilled counterparts after giving birth, primarily seen in a lack of wage growth.\n\nLow-earning women who have children are sacrificing about 10 to 14 percent of their total lifetime earnings. Even ten years after having children, a mother in the US in this income bracket earns wages that are about 12% lower than non-mother, low-skilled women. This group of mothers tends to experience a one-time fall in pay immediately after childbirth of about 6%, but after that initial fall the wage gap between women with children and those without does not continue to grow over time.\n\nA theory frequently cited for why mothers earning lower wages than other women that is the fact that mothers tend to spend fewer hours in the workplace than non-mothers. A report in 2014 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working part-time. Part-time work and flextime or more flexible arrangements are seen as hallmarks of the mommy track, since they point to women not being in the workplace full-time. However, this is changing as more people‚Äîmen and women alike‚Äîchoose more flexible work arrangements that allow for more free time.\n\nIn the years since the women‚Äôs liberation movement and second-wave feminism, gender roles have become more complicated and less dogmatic. Despite this, the modern ideal of ‚Äúintensive parenting,‚Äù first described by Sharon Hays, ensures that mothers continue to take primary responsibility for raising children due to the engrained social norm that women are better nurturers. This is one of the reasons that while both men and women report having increased trouble with their work-life balance after having a baby, women are the only ones whose hours working decrease as a response to this conflict. Moreover, women who cannot afford to pay someone else to take care of domestic work are faced with the double burden of working outside of the home while continuing to complete the majority of domestic work in the home.\n\nAnother cultural influence on mothers' decreased presence in the workforce is gender discrimination within the U.S. tax code. Since domestic labor in one‚Äôs own home is unpaid and untaxed, and women continue to do a majority of domestic labor as a result of societal norms, in many households it may seem less expensive for a woman to take care of this labor than to go to work and pay someone else to cook, clean, and care for children. The tax code also sees men as the primary earners and women as secondary earners, so men benefit from joint filing while women‚Äôs earnings are frequently subject to higher taxation.\n\nMany feminists saw the idea of the mommy track as divisive to women and therefore one that could have a detrimental effect to the feminist cause. Since Schwartz‚Äôs initial article proposed sorting women into two categories based on their devotion to careers, some saw this as a division between women that both forced them into narrow categories and ignored any existing differences between men.\n\nThere is also an ongoing discussion of whether the wage gap that results from a mommy track is any sort of societal discrimination against women, or basically an effect of mothers choosing to spend more time away from work.\n\nIn a 2005 study, in the US, it has been estimated that 31% of working mothers left the workplace (for an average of 2.2 years), most often precipitated by the birth of the second child. As of 2015, the US was one of only three countries in the world (the other two being Papua New Guinea and Suriname) that does not have laws that require employers to provide paid maternity leave.\n\nJapan‚Äôs social norms, like those of the U.S., help to cause many women to move into part-time work upon having children. However, unlike the U.S., Japanese mothers rarely return to full-time work after having children. Even more so than other developed countries, Japan has an especially high proportion of women who work part-time, and a majority of those women are mothers. Common business practices in Japan further penalize mothers who may have taken leave from the workplace at some point, due to companies choosing to only recruit directly from universities and setting upper limits on age for full-time positions.\n\nIn the Netherlands women have entered the workforce relatively recently. Throughout much of the 20th century, women faced many legal and social obstacles preventing them from working. Although in the late 1950s, the Netherlands made important legal changes, such as removing the marriage bar and the marital power of the husband, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved - prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband's opinion prevailed over the wife's regarding issues such as decisions on children's education and the domicile of the family, reflecting the traditional structure of the society.\nAlso, according to \"The Economist\", \"[Dutch] politics was dominated by Christian values until the 1980s\", which meant that Dutch women were slower to enter into the workforce. In the early 1980s, the Commission of the European Communities report \"Women in the European Community\" found that \"it is in the Netherlands (17.6%) and in Ireland (13.6%) that we see the smallest numbers of married women working and the least acceptance of this phenomenon by the general public\". (pg 14). From the 1980s onwards, the numbers of women entering the workplace have increased, but most of the women work part time. In 2012, 76.9% of employed women worked part-time, well above the European Union average of 32.1%.\n\nThe UK has less working mothers than many other Western countries. Lack of sufficient childcare and social stigma against working mothers have been cited as reasons. In general, women in the UK have one of the highest rate of part-time work in Europe. A report by OECD which looked at the OECD members, as well as at other countries from inside and outside Europe, found that only the Netherlands and Switzerland had a higher percentage of women working part-time. Women in the UK face one of the worst motherhood penalties among Western countries: \"[mothers] find significant motherhood wage penalties in several Continental Northern European countries (Austria, the Netherlands and Germany) and Anglophone countries (Canada, the UK and the US)\". The European Council, in a recommendation to the UK (which is non-binding), has criticized the UK because \"The difference in the share of part-time work between women (42,6 % in 2013) and men (13,2 % in 2013) is one of the highest in the Union. The percentage of women who are inactive or work part-time due to personal and family responsibilities (12,5 %) was almost twice as high as the EU average (6,3 %) in 2013...[e]ven if supply in the childcare system has increased recently, the availability of affordable, high-quality, full-time childcare remains a key issue.\"\n\nIn the Nordic countries, marriage and having children have far greater effects on women than on men, partly due to the expectation that women will continue unpaid domestic labor. However, the Nordic countries have worked to make the dual-earner household the norm, with nationalized childcare, parental leave, and flexible working hours making it possible for women to continue to work. According to a 2007 UNICEF report, in Sweden, although parents are given 12 months of parental leave time that can be divided between the two as each couple sees best, gender norms continue to have an effect: mandated maternity leave combined with Sweden allowing women to reduce work hours after giving birth means that nearly half of mothers in dual-income families work less than full-time. Although women in Nordic countries have a high overall labour participation, there is a strong segregation by gender with women being often found in certain work sectors, which have a working culture adapted to family life, with flexible hours and offers of part-time jobs, and men working in other sectors. According to the Nordic Information on Gender \"The gender-segregated labour market is a main reason why women are more likely to work part time in the Nordic countries than elsewhere in Europe\". However, this part-time work culture does not extend to Finland, where for historical reasons there was a shortage of labour in the country, which increased the need for women to work full time - as such, the part-time culture of the other Nordic countries was never established in Finland. Finland has a longer tradition of mothers working, compared to the other Nordic countries: in 1978, 73% of Finnish mothers of 0 - 6 year olds were employed, compared to 69% of Swedish and only 48% of Norwegian.\nAs of 2014, Sweden's employment rate for women was the highest in the EU28, and was only slightly below that of men (73% female rate vs. 76.5% male rate). This compared with the EU28 rate of 58.8% female vs 69% male.\n\n\nPolicies:\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n"}

A mursm√§cka was a female construction worker with the task to hand mortar during construction work. The profession is recorded from at least 1691 (though it is not confirmed by name until the 1830s) and discontinued in 1922. This was a very hard but common work for a poor uneducated woman during the 19th century, particularly in Stockholm. In July 1888, the Mursm√§cka of Stockholm performed a great strike action which attracted considerable attention in contemporary Sweden.\n\nIt is unknown when the profession was first practiced. The first illustration of female construction workers in Sweden are from 1691, and they are frequently mentioned in the payrolls in the 18th century. The name Mursm√§cka is first recorded in the 1830s, when they were apparently already long established as a regular part of a construction site work force. During the 19th century, they were common in all cities in Sweden, especially in Stockholm, where there was a building boom in the latter half of that century.\n\nTheir task was to manufacture the mortar, during the work and carry it to the bricklayers. The work was very hard, badly reputed and, though the salary was possible to live on, it was very low. According to an investigation from 1897, most of the women active in the profession were uneducated destitute unmarried women, often unmarried mothers. As they were very little construction work during winter time, the mursm√§ckas, just as their male colleagues, were forced to live on other work, in their case often charring.\n\nIn 1888, the mursm√§ckas launched a strike in Stockholm to raise their salary. This attracted a great deal of attention because of their gender, and the newspapers called it The Women's Strike. They succeeded and their salary was raised, though it was lowered again just a few years later. Mursm√§ckas became members of the Bricklayers' Union after it was founded in 1897. In 1904, a new work regulation was enforced in which an entire construction work team was paid according to how much they could work, which in effect meant that they could raise their salaries and split it among them if they could keep up a high work speed. The consequence was that the male workers became less willing to include women in their teams, as they doubted that they could keep the same work speed as their male colleagues, which because of the new regulation would affect the income of the whole team. This meant that the mursm√§ckas had to start to compete with male rivals performing the same tasks as they in the work team.\n\nDuring World War I, no buildings were erected, and when the war was over and there was a great deal of people unemployed, male workers were favored over females and the task previously belonging to women in construction work teams were given to men, thereby ending the profession of mursm√§cka. The last mursm√§cka retired in 1922.\n\n"}

The ultimate causes and mechanisms of sexual orientation development in humans remain unclear and many theories are speculative and controversial. However, advances in neuroscience explain and illustrate characteristics linked to sexual orientation. Studies have explored structural neural-correlates, functional and/or cognitive relationships, and developmental theories relating to sexual orientation in humans.\n\nMany theories concerning the development of sexual orientation involve fetal neural development, with proposed models illustrating prenatal hormone exposure, maternal immunity, and developmental instability. Other proposed factors include genetic control of sexual orientation. No conclusive evidence has been shown that environmental or learned effects are responsible for the development of non-heterosexual orientation.\n\nAs of 2005, sexual dimorphisms in the brain and behavior among vertebrates were accounted for by the influence of gonadal steroidal androgens as demonstrated in animal models over the prior few few decades. The prenatal androgen model of homosexuality describes the neuro-developmental effects of fetal exposure to these hormones. In 1985, Geschwind and Galaburda proposed that homosexual men are exposed to high androgen levels early in development and proposed that temporal and local variations in androgen exposure to a fetus's developing brain is a factor in the pathways determining homosexuality. This led scientists to look for somatic markers for prenatal hormonal exposure that could be easily, and non-invasively, explored in otherwise endocrinologically normal populations. Various somatic markers (including 2D:4D finger ratios, auditory evoked potentials, fingerprint patterns and eye-blink patterns) have since been found to show variation based on sexual orientation in healthy adult individuals.\n\nOther evidence supporting the role of testosterone and prenatal hormones in sexual orientation development include observations of male subjects with cloacal exstrophy who were sex-assigned as female during birth only later to declare themselves male. This supports the theory that the prenatal testosterone surge is crucial for gender identity development.

The term typically describes a class of the rich who have been able to maintain their wealth over multiple generations, often referring to perceived members of the \"de facto\" aristocracy in societies that historically lack an officially established aristocratic class (such as the US).\n\n\"Wealth\"‚Äîassets held by an individual or by a household‚Äîprovides an important dimension of social stratification because it can pass from generation to generation, ensuring that a family's offspring will remain financially stable. Families with \"old money\" use accumulated assets or savings to bridge interruptions in income, thus guarding against downward social mobility.\n\nOld Money was typically associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (\"WASP\") status.\n\n\"Old money\" applies to those of the upper class whose wealth separates them from lower social classes. According to anthropologist W. Lloyd Warner, the upper class in the United States during the 1930s was divided into the upper-upper and the lower-upper classes. The lower-upper were those that did not come from traditionally wealthy families. They earned their money from investments and business like John D. Rockefeller, whose father was a traveling peddler, rather than inheritance. In contrast to the \"nouveau riche\", the upper-upper class were families viewed as \"quasi-aristocratic\" and \"high-society\". These families had been rich and prominent in American politics for generations in many cases since before the Revolution when their ancestors had accumulated fortunes as members of the elite planter class, or as merchants, slave traders, ship owners, or fur traders. In many cases, especially in Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas the source of these families wealth were vast tracts of land granted to their ancestors by the Crown and or acquired by headright during the colonial period. These families sometimes known as American gentry produced several Founding Fathers of the United States and a number of early U.S. Presidents including George Washington, who with an estimated net worth of $525 million (in 2016 dollars) due to his vast holdings of land and slaves, was the wealthiest man to hold the office prior to the election of billionaire Donald Trump in 2016. \n\nDuring the early 20th century, the upper-upper class were seen as more prestigious than the nouveau riche.During the late 19th century and early 20th century the nouveau rich flaunted their wealth by building Gilded Age mansions that emulated the palaces of European royalty while old money was more conservative. American \"Old money\" families tend to adhere to various Mainline Protestant denominations; Episcopalians and Presbyterians are most prevalent. \n\nSome families with \"old money\" include:\n\n\n\nAlthough many \"old money\" individuals do not rank as high on the list of Forbes 400 richest Americans as they once did, their wealth continues to grow. Many families increased their holdings by investment strategies such as the pooling of resources. For example, the Rockefeller family's estimated net worth of $1 billion in the 1930s grew to $8.5 billion by 2000‚Äîthat is, not adjusted for inflation. In 60 years, four of the richest families in the United States increased their combined $2‚Äì4 billion in 1937 to $38 billion without holding large shares in emerging industries. When adjusted for inflation, the actual dollar wealth of many of these families has shrunk since the 30s.\n\nFrom a private wealth manager's perspective, \"old money\" can be classified into two: active \"old money\" and passive \"old money\". The former includes inheritors who, despite the inherited wealth at their disposal or that which they can access in the future, choose to pursue their own career or set up their own businesses. Paris Hilton and Sir Stelios Iaonnou are examples of this category. On the other hand, passive \"old money\" are those who are the idle rich or those who are not wealth producers. \n\n\"Old money\" contrasts with the \"nouveau riche\" and \"parvenus\". These fall under the category \"new money\" (those not from traditionally wealthy families). \n\nEconomists assert that the largest transfer of wealth will be as the older generation leaves wealth to the baby boomers. Inheritance has been estimated to make up 6% of the US GDP each year. The current generation is wealthier than any generation before. This increase in wealth and inheritance indicates a rise of \"old money\" in American families. Stephen Haseler argues that America is becoming an inheritance culture in which much economic opportunity is from family inheritance and not personal achievement.\n\nThe Rothschild family, as an example, established finance houses across Europe from the 18th century and was ennobled by the Habsburg Emperor and Queen Victoria. Throughout the 19th century, they controlled the largest fortune in the world, in today's terms many hundreds of billions. The family has, at least to some extent, maintained its wealth for over two centuries. The Rothschilds were not, however, considered \"old money\" by their British counterparts. In Britain, the term generally exclusively refers to the landed gentry, usually the aristocracy and nobility who traditionally live off the land inherited paternally. The British concept is analogous to good lineage and it is not uncommon to find someone with \"old money\" who is actually poor or insolvent. By 2001, however, those belonging to this category - the aristocratic landowners - are still part of the wealthiest list in the United Kingdom. For instance, the Duke of Westminster, by way of his Grosvenor estate, owns large swaths of properties in London that include 200 acres of Belgravia and 100 acres of Mayfair. There is also the case of Viscount Portman, who is the owner of 100 acres of land north of Oxford Street.\n\nIn France, the \"200 families\" controlled much of the nation's wealth after 1815. The \"200\" is based on the policy that of the 40,000 shareholders of the Bank of France, only 200 were allowed to attend the annual meeting and they cast all the votes. Out of a nation of 27 million people, only 80,000 to 90,000 were allowed to vote in 1820, and the richest one-fourth of them had two votes.\n\nThe ITV television series \"Downton Abbey\" frequently contrasts the differences between Old Money and New Money in Britain during the early 20th century. Notably between the newspaperman Sir Richard Carlisle and the heiress Lady Mary Crawley, the distinction being the aggression of the \"parvenu\" Sir Richard and the \"noblesse oblige\" of the Crawleys.\n\nPerhaps the greatest literary critique of the tension between Old Money and New Money can be found in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\". The characters in possession of old money represented by the \"Tom Buchanan\" family (Tom and Daisy), get away with (literally) murder; while those with new money, represented by Gatsby himself, are alternately embraced and scorned by other characters in the book. Fitzgerald vastly critiques people in possession of old money through his narrator Nick Carraway: \"‚ÄúThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.‚Äù\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37271778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37271778", "title": "Operation Yewtree", "text": "Operation Yewtree\n\nOperation Yewtree is a police investigation into sexual abuse allegations, predominantly the abuse of children, against the British media personality Jimmy Savile and others. The investigation, led by the Metropolitan Police Service, started in October 2012. After a period of assessment it became a full criminal investigation, involving inquiries into living people, notably other celebrities, as well as Savile.\n\nThe report of the investigations into the activities of Savile himself was published, as \"Giving Victims a Voice\", in January 2013. Operation Yewtree continued as an investigation into others, some but not all linked with Savile. By October 2015, 19 people had been arrested by Operation Yewtree; seven of these arrests led to convictions. The \"Yewtree effect\" has been credited for an increase in the number of reported sex crimes, while the operation also sparked a debate on police procedure and rights of those accused of sex crimes.\n\nAn ITV documentary, \"Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile\", researched and presented by former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, was broadcast on 3 October 2012, almost a year after Savile's death. The programme contained several allegations by women who said that, as teenagers, they had been sexually abused by radio and television personality Jimmy Savile, who had gained access to them through the television programmes he had presented and his charity work. Following the broadcast, many other people came forward to make allegations about Savile's conduct towards young people, including sexual abuse that had taken place on BBC premises and in hospitals to which Savile had access.\n\nOn 4 October 2012, the Metropolitan Police said it would take the national lead in a process of assessing the allegations. The assessment was undertaken by the Serious Case Team of the service's Child Abuse Investigation Command, led by Detective Superintendent David Gray working closely with the BBC. The police said, \"Our priority will be to ensure a proportionate and consistent policing response putting the victims at the heart of our enquiries\", and that \"it is not an investigation at this stage\".\n\nThe Metropolitan Police announced on 9 October that the inquiry into the allegations would be called \"Operation Yewtree\", and would be undertaken jointly with the NSPCC. The police had formally recorded eight allegations against Savile, but announced they were following 120 lines of inquiry, covering up to 25 victims of abuse, mainly girls aged between 13 and 16. The allegations covered four decades, from 1959 until the 1980s, and were on \"a national scale\". Commander Peter Spindler, head of specialist crime investigations, said, \"At this stage it is quite clear from what women are telling us that Savile was a predatory sex offender.\"\n\n\"Yewtree\" was chosen from a list of names which are intended to be neutral and unrelated to each particular case. This system, dating back to the 1980s, is used for operations which are started to handle specific crimes, as opposed to more general, pro-active operations with names connected to their intent.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation on 19 October 2012 as, in addition to the historic allegations of child sex abuse by Savile, there were \"lines of inquiry involving living people that require formal investigation\". The criminal investigations within Operation Yewtree were led by Detective Chief Superintendent Keith Niven, head of the Metropolitan Police's child abuse investigation command, and by December 2012, 30 officers were involved with the case. In saying that the operation was \"dealing with alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale\" and that it \"empowered a staggering number of victims to come forward to report the sexual exploitation which occurred during their childhood\", Commander Peter Spindler said that: \"We are dealing with a major criminal investigation. This is a watershed moment for child abuse investigations and Yewtree will be a landmark investigation.\" The operation follows three strands: allegations against Savile, allegations against Savile and others, and allegations just involving others. On 11 December, the Metropolitan Police stated that the investigation of the abuse undertaken by Savile had been completed and the report into his alleged offending, \"Giving Victims a Voice\", was released in January 2013.\n\nThe investigation into \"others\" continued after the Savile investigation concluded. In May 2013, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"at least 69 police officers and staff members\" were involved in the operation and that many of the suspects were celebrities. The operation passed files to South Yorkshire Police in the investigation of Cliff Richard, and passed files to North Yorkshire Police in the investigation of Jimmy Tarbuck. Neither case resulted in charges. In June 2016, after child abuse allegations regarding Clement Freud were made public, it was reported that Operation Yewtree had been passed information about Freud in 2012 when two alleged victims made accusations to the NSPCC. A December 2015 freedom of information disclosure revealed that Scotland Yard spent ¬£2.2m a year on Operation Yewtree.\n\nThe joint report prepared by the Metropolitan Police Service and the NSPCC, \"Giving Victims a Voice\", was published in January 2013, and marked the end of investigations under Operation Yewtree into Savile alone. It reported that sex offences were committed by Savile on 450 people (328 being children at the time), across England and Scotland, with allegations also made in Jersey. The vast majority of offences occurred in his home town of Leeds and in London, his main place of work.\n\nAllegations associating Savile with abuse at Jersey children's home Haut de la Garenne were made in 2008, during Savile's lifetime. He commenced legal action against \"The Sun\" newspaper in response; Savile's lawyer said \"The reported events are the antithesis of everything Sir James has worked tirelessly to prevent\". No action was taken against Savile at this time.\n\nThe victims were \"mainly not known to each other\". His youngest victim was aged , the oldest 47. Most were aged 1316, with 73% being under 18 and the majority being minors. The attacks included 18 girls and 10 boys under the age of 10, and were mostly against young girls aged under 16.\n\nThe offences were mostly opportunistic, although child grooming was involved in some cases. The first and final known offences were in 1955 and 2009 respectively. The period containing most frequent offending was between 1966 and 1976 (when he was aged 4050), coinciding with his \"peak [celebrity] status\". The most frequent offending was during 1975 and 1976 with each year having 15 offences recorded in it.\n\nMost allegations had not previously been reported to authorities, with victims stating reasons of fear of disbelief or distrust of the judicial system. At least seven allegations of sexual assault made to police during Savile's lifetime were not linked. The CPS said prosecutions \"might have been possible\" in connection with allegations made to Surrey Police between 2007 and 2009.\n\nSavile's celebrity status meant that he was considered to have been \"hiding in plain sight\". Operation Yewtree's senior investigating officer, DSI David Gray, said Savile used \"Jim'll Fix It\" \"as a vehicle to gain access to victims\".\n\nApproximately 600 people had provided information at the time of the publication of the Savile report, \"Giving Victims a Voice\", of which 450 related to Savile. A total of 214 criminal offences were formally recorded across 28 police forces. The NSPCC described Savile as \"one of the most prolific sex offenders in its 129-year history\". The BBC restated a \"sincere apology to the victims\".\n\nDuring Operation Yewtree, several other high-profile British public figures were investigated for sexual offences. These included television and radio presenter Stuart Hall, who was convicted of 15 counts of indecent assault, ITV Granada weatherman Fred Talbot, who was jailed after being found guilty of sexually assaulting two schoolboys, and DJ and friend of Savile, Ray Teret, who was found guilty of seven rapes and eleven indecent assaults and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. \"Coronation Street\" actors William Roache and Michael Le Vell were both separately found not guilty of all charges made against them, and DJ Neil Fox was acquitted of several charges.\n\nAlthough these allegations, investigations and prosecutions were not directly connected to Operation Yewtree, they were linked in public imagination. In particular, Roache's defence argued that Operation Yewtree had created an atmosphere in which allegations of sexual abuse against celebrities were more likely to be taken to prosecution, while several other commentators speculated that the decision in particular to prosecute Roache and Le Vell may have been influenced by the high profile of Yewtree. These cases, combined with Operation Yewtree, were credited for an increase in the reporting of sexual offences during 2013.\n\nIn response to a large increase of complainants coming forward in the summer of 2014 in the wake of the Savile scandal, Operation Hydrant, a new operation into historic child sex abuse allegations was launched by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). As of 20 May 2015, 1433 suspects - including 261 of \"public prominence\" (135 from TV, film or radio) and 666 from institutions (including 154 from schools, 75 from children's homes, 40 from religious institutions and 14 medical establishments) - have been identified. Operation Hydrant is not responsible for conducting independent investigations; it gathers information from other inquiries, including Operation Yewtree.\n\nOperation Ravine is an investigation by Surrey Police into alleged sexual abuse connected to the Walton Hop disco. A previous investigation into the Walton Hop disco, Operation Arundel, resulted in the convictions of Chris Denning and music mogul Jonathan King for child sex offences in the early 2000s. In January 2014, Merseyside Police carried out an independent review of Operation Arundel and related materials were shared with Operation Yewtree. On 10 September 2015, three men were arrested as part of Operation Ravine, including Jonathan King. Denning was charged with 6 offences stemming from the investigation on 7 June 2016, and he pleaded guilty to 21 offences on 22 August 2016. On 7 October, Denning was sentenced to 13 years for these additional offences. King stood trial in June 2018 but the jury was discharged for legal reasons. On 6 August 2018, King received an apology for the collapse of the trial, with Judge Deborah Taylor saying that Surrey Police had made \"numerous, repeated and compounded\" errors during the investigation, describing the situation as a \"debacle\".\n\nIn response to some having labelled Operation Yewtree a \"witch-hunt\", Joan Smith of \"The Guardian\" stated that the conviction of Max Clifford vindicated the operation, and Martin Evans of \"The Daily Telegraph\" said that despite several high-profile failures, Rolf Harris' conviction vindicated it. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe denied claims of a witch-hunt, commenting that the alternative would be to ignore allegations. Paul Gambaccini, who was arrested and bailed repeatedly for a year before being told he would face no further action, testified before the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee on 3 March 2015. He told MPs he was the victim of a witch-hunt and that he was used as human \"fly paper\" to encourage other people to come forward and make allegations against him. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders denied the allegations. In a November 2015 debate organized by the NSPCC on whether investigations into historic sexual abuse had turned into \"media witch-hunts\", former Metropolitan Police commander Peter Spindler said that police \"got some things wrong\" and that they \"didn't have sufficient resources in place.\"\n\nIn an article for \"The Spectator\", Rod Liddle criticised the handling of these cases by police, especially in the case of Freddie Starr, who was arrested four times and bailed nine times before being told he would not be charged, claiming: \"the way the police have conducted the process is hugely unfair\". In the aftermath of Cliff Richard's August 2014 property search, human rights barrister Geoffrey Robertson wrote in \"The Independent\" that the long delays before announcing charges amounted to \"outrageous treatment\", adding: \"This has been one of the most intolerable features of other high-profile arrests for 'historic' offences, namely the inability of police and prosecutors to deliver Magna Carta‚Äôs truly historic promise that justice will not be delayed.\" After others, including Jim Davidson and Gambaccini, were left on bail for many months before being told they would not face charges, then-Home Secretary Theresa May proposed that bail time be limited to 28 days. The 28-day limit came into effect in April 2017.\n\nAt a Labour Party conference in July 2014, comedian and friend of Gambaccini Stephen Fry criticised the operation, pointing out that fewer than half of those accused at the time had been found guilty, and called for tougher laws to prevent false sex abuse allegations. MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of unrelated sexual assault charges, has called for individuals to receive anonymity until charged.\n\nRosie Millard criticized the operation after Dave Lee Travis was convicted on one count of indecent assault for groping a woman's breast for 15 seconds in 1995, saying: \"one has to ask whether the Operation Yewtree fervour, fuelled no doubt by the frustration that one of Britain‚Äôs sickest and most evil perverts died before he could come to justice, has simply gone a bit crazy. If we started jailing every man who has ever squeezed a breast, there would be no time for any other sort of case in our courts, and our prisons would be the size of a small city.\" Carole Malone claimed the case against Travis was a \"witch-hunt\", adding \"if police spent more of their limited time and resources hunting dangerous sex criminals ‚Äì and less on celebrity gropers ‚Äì the world would be a safer place.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", the failed Metropolitan Police investigation, Operation Midland, was \"forged by the experience of the Jimmy Savile scandal, and the subsequent Operation Yewtree inquiry\"; in particular, the use of a high-profile press conference to get additional victims to come forward to corroborate each other‚Äôs stories. In February 2016, the late Irish Supreme Court Judge Adrian Hardiman criticised the methods used by Operation Yewtree, particularly the treatment of Paul Gambaccini, as well as the investigations of Cliff Richard and the Midland cases of Leon Brittan and Edwin Bramall, for what he described as the radical undermining of the presumption of innocence. A report by Sir Richard Henriques into the Metropolitan Police's sexual abuse investigations was critical of the handling of Operation Midland but reserved praise for Operation Yewtree. Gambaccini, Bramall and Harvey Proctor, who had been investigated by Operation Midland, sued the Metropolitan Police for ¬£3m in February 2017. In November 2018, Gambaccini reached an out-of-court settlement with the Crown Prosecution Service and received an undisclosed amount in damages.\n\nOperation Yewtree was the inspiration for a drama, \"National Treasure\", starring Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and Andrea Riseborough. Coltrane played Paul Finchley, a fictional light-entertainment performer accused of rape, Walters played Finchley's wife Marie, and Riseborough played their daughter Danielle (\"Dee\"). The four-part series, by The Forge, was broadcast September‚ÄìOctober 2016 on Channel 4.\n\n\n"}

The news report argued that sexual abuse in seven different churches around the United States were all connected to First Baptist Church of Hammond and its Pastor, Jack Hyles. Hyles called the program \"poor journalism\" and organized a national campaign to respond.\n\nThe news report aired a six-part series stemming from child sexual abuse allegations against deacon Mark Foeller and associate pastor Timothy Leonard (a graduate of Hyles-Anderson College, an unaccredited institution), of North Sharon Baptist Church near Ann Arbor.\" Leonard, \"North Sharon's associate pastor and a graduate of Hyles Anderson College of Schererville, was charged in Michigan with first- and second-degree sexual assault of children.\" The \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" noted \"the news report found seven U.S. churches - all with ties to Jack Hyles, it said - involved in sex scandals.\" Thus, the TV station noted alleged child molestations at a church \"appeared to be part of a pattern among 'churches that follow the teachings and philosophy' of Hyles, First Baptist and its related Hyles-Anderson College of Crown Point, Indiana\"\n\nThe mini-series \"showed footage during its report of [Hyles] brandishing a rifle from the pulpit\", along with \"people with guns and walkie-talkies patrolling the outside of the church at times.\" Additionally \"the station also recapped a sermon in 1990 in which Hyles pretended to pour poison into a glass and asked an associate pastor, Johnny Colsten, to drink from it. Colsten said he would.\" Furthermore, \"The WJBK report said the sermon has the 'ring of Jonestown' to it‚Äîthe mass suicide in Guyana in 1978 by followers of cult leader Jim Jones.\" In fact \"WJBK also reported that Hyles, though never claiming to be God, has convinced a lot of people he is the next best thing to Him.\"\n\nThe report also described the links of \"a deacon at First Baptist, A.V. Ballenger, [who] was found guilty of one count of child molestation dating from 1991.\" Also discussed in the news report was the comments Hyles made to the parents of the girl molested by Ballenger. The \"Chicago Tribune\" in a 1991 article reported that Hyles was sued for $1 million by the parents of the girl molested by Ballenger. The paper reported the \"lawsuit claims Hyles and the church had not fulfilled their obligation to ensure that children were protected from harm during Sunday school.\" This stemmed from their mentioning the molestation to Hyles who then promised to \"investigate\". After two months of nothing being done, the parents went to the police. Furthermore, \"the suit, filed last week, claims the minister told the child's parents that Ballenger 'just liked little girls,' and, 'You don't have a case.'\" Hyles and the church settled out of court. Ballenger was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nThe Detroit news program was not the only one to study if there was a connection between deacon Ballenger at Hyles' church and the North Sharon associate pastor, who graduated from Hyles-Anderson College. The prosecuting attorney for Washtenaw County, Michigan went to the Ballenger trial \"to watch, listen to testimony and observe similarities between this case and other cases involving a rural church [in] Michigan.\"\n\nOn May 14, 1993 \"the FBI was asked to look into allegations minors were taken from Michigan to Northwest Indiana by employees or officials of North Sharon Baptist Church near Ann Arbor for events sponsored by Hammond First Baptist Church.\" The FBI concluded, \"there is insufficient evidence to probe allegations.\" On Friday, May 19, 1993 Sgt. Charles Hedinger, a Hammond police detective, described the Hyles investigation as \"open-ended.\"\n\nJack Hyles said that he welcomed an investigation by the police and he attended a meeting with city officials to discuss it. Hyles emerged from the meeting saying that there was no investigation. Confirmation of this came on Wednesday, May 24, 1993, the Chief of Police detectives, Capt. Bill Conner was quoted in the \"Tribune\" saying that, \"There is no investigation of the First Baptist Church of Hammond or Jack Hyles\". On June 1, 1993 The Lake County, Indiana prosecutor's office stated that it did not have any cases involving Hyles or the First Baptist Church of Hammond.On the same day, the Hammond Police Department reaffirmed the statement it made the previous month when it confirmed that there was no investigation of Hyles or the church.\n\nHyles told his congregation that WJBK's news anchorman was fired and 12 sponsors had dropped the evening news, but Mort Meisner, news director for WJBK, said neither of those statements were true.\n\nOn May 19, 1993, \"The Times of Northwest Indiana\" ran a story entitled \"Baptism by innuendo\", which criticized WJBK-TV's reporting. The \"Times\" wrote, \"If one were to take the insinuations of Detroit television station WJBK-TV seriously, one could get the impression that the First Baptist Church of Hammond is a sex-crime factory and that its pastors school in Hammond and the affiliated Hyles Anderson College in Schererville are institutions where people minor in molestation.\" The Times also suggested that the May ratings period, which is traditionally known for such similar sensationalized stories, was not a good enough excuse to make up for the poor journalism the stories displayed, concluding that the stories were \"a monstrous overreach\". The Times went on to say: \"There is no large institution of any kind where some wrongdoers cannot be found. First Baptist and its affiliated institutions are no exception.

Physical and psychological dependence are sometimes classified as a facet or component of addiction, such as in the DSM-IV-TR; however, some drugs which produce dependence syndromes do not produce addiction, and vice versa, in humans. Addiction and psychological dependence are both mediated through reinforcement, a form of operant conditioning, but are associated with different forms of reinforcement. Addiction is a compulsion for rewarding stimuli that is mediated through positive reinforcement. Psychological dependence, which is mediated through negative reinforcement, involves a desire to use a drug or perform a behavior to avoid the unpleasant withdrawal syndrome that results from cessation of exposure to it.\n\nPsychological dependence develops through consistent and frequent exposure to a stimulus. Behaviors which can produce observable psychological withdrawal symptoms (i.e., cause psychological dependence) include physical exercise, shopping, sex and self-stimulation using pornography, and eating food with high sugar or fat content, among others. Behavioral therapy is typically employed to help individuals overcome psychological dependence upon drugs or maladaptive behaviors that produce psychological dependence.\n\n"}

It was directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The screenplay was by Robert Ardrey, adapted by George Froeschel from the novel \"Quentin Durward\" by Sir Walter Scott.\n\nIt was the third in an unofficial trilogy made by the same director and producer and starring Robert Taylor. The first two were \"Ivanhoe\" (1952) and \"Knights of the Round Table\" (1953). All three were made at MGM's British Studios at Elstree, near London. The film had the distinction of a soundtrack composed by studio music mainstay Bronislau Kaper rather than Miklos Rozsa, who was busy on other projects at the time the film was ready for scoring.\n\nIt was the first big-budget film for the British actress Kay Kendall, and it featured a large contingent of distinguished British players, including Robert Morley.\n\nIn 1465, honorable but penniless Scottish knight Quentin Durward (Robert Taylor) agrees to go to France to find out if the beautiful young heiress, Isabelle, Countess of Marcroy (Kay Kendall), would be a suitable wife for his aged uncle (that is, if she is as rich as is claimed). The marriage has been arranged by Charles, Duke of Burgundy (Alec Clunes) for his ward to cement an alliance with Scotland, but she wants nothing to do with it, so she runs away and seeks the protection of Charles' great rival, Louis XI (Robert Morley), King of France. Quentin pursues and manages to foil an attempted robbery by brigands under the command of Count William de La Marck (Duncan Lamont), though Isabelle continues on her way unaware of her protector's identity.\n\nNearing the court of King Louis, Quentin tries, but fails, to save the life of a gypsy. However, the dead man's brother, Hayraddin (George Cole), is grateful for his efforts. Louis, who had ordered the man's hanging as a Burgundian spy, and distrusts such honest men as Quentin, orders him to leave France. However, the Scotsman is not easily deterred. He sneaks into the heavily guarded castle and awakens the King in his bed with a dagger at his throat. Louis is impressed and enlists Quentin in his service.\n\nUpon the unexpected arrival of Count Phillip de Creville (Marius Goring), a Burgundian ambassador seeking Isabelle, Louis orders Quentin to guard her and to keep her presence secret. During the time they spend together, she and Quentin begin to fall in love.\n\nHaving lied about Isabelle being there, Louis commands her to depart. She tells him that she will seek sanctuary with an old friend, the Bishop of Liege (Harcourt Williams). Louis concocts a plan to have De la Marck kidnap and forcibly marry Isabelle to keep her strategically important lands out of Burgundian hands. He has Hayraddin, who is a spy in his employ, take the information and a large bribe to De la Marck. Louis provides Isabelle with a detailed itinerary (the better for De la Marck to find her). He also lends her a few guards, including Quentin, so that when they are killed, it will divert any suspicion away from him. Hayraddin is also sent as a guide. However, when he discovers that Quentin is to be one of the victims, he warns the Scotsman. The three manage to escape the trap and reach Li√®ge, though Quentin is wounded.\n\nWhen he has recovered, he finally tells Isabelle of his obligation to his uncle, which prevents him from courting her himself, and leaves. De la Marck attacks the castle, captures Isabelle, and kills the bishop when he refuses to marry them. Hearing the sounds of battle, Quentin rescues his love. He slays De la Marck in an unusual duel involving the combatants in the burning bell tower, swinging from the ropes used to ring the church bells.\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Burgundy arrests Louis when he comes to continue peace negotiations, accusing him of orchestrating the murder of the bishop. However, Quentin arrives and exonerates the King, providing as proof De la Marck's severed head. Out of gratitude (and in France's best interests), Louis tricks Charles into letting Isabelle decide whom she will marry. Quentin has received news that his uncle has died, so he is free to follow his heart.\n\n\nIn 1951, MGM filmed an adaptation of \"Ivanhoe\" by Sir Walter Scott in Britain, starring Robert Taylor and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The studio was so pleased with the results that even before the film was released they were looking at a follow up for Taylor, and \"Quentin Durward\" was suggested. The project became a certainty when \"Ivanhoe\" became one of the biggest hits of Taylor's career. He was scheduled to make the film after completing \"Knights of the Round Table\".\n\nProducer Berman thought that audiences would accept romance if it was presented \"at face value, on a pure basis, as a clean unsmutty kind of thing and without sexy overtones. I haven't got any rules to lay down for successful pictures, but one fact is sure today - people want something besides words, beside conversation pieces from the screen. Once in a while you have a 'Streetcar', in which all the actors talk their fool heads off, and it's a hit anyway, but for myself I'm committed to pictures with action and scenic and pictorial scope.\"\n\nA number of female stars were mentioned as possibles to appear opposite Taylor, including Deborah Kerr, Elizabeth Taylor, Ann Blyth and Grace Kelly. For a time, Robert Taylor's busy schedule saw Stewart Granger emerge as a contender to replace him but Taylor ended up playing the part. Grace Kelly turned down the film and Kay Kendall was given the part.\n\nBosley Crowther gave the film a poor review in \"The New York Times\", writing, \"it lacks for excitement when ... the intrigues of France's Louis XI and the Duke of Burgundy are placed upon the screen in such lengthy and ponderous complexity that they exhaust and befuddle the mind.\" \"The times when this heavily stuffed contrivance does have a tendency to move are when Mr. Taylor is working to get himself out of jams ... And the big terminal fight ... swinging on bell-ropes ... is pretty good.\"\n\nIn contrast with \"Ivanhoe\" and \"Knights of the Round Table\" the film did not perform well at the box office - according to MGM records it made $658,000 in the US and Canada and $1,517,000 elsewhere resulting in a $1,226,000 loss.\n\n\n\n"}

In its application, transition management seeks to bring together multiple viewpoints and multiple approaches in a 'transition arena'. Participants are invited to structure their shared problems with the current system and develop shared visions and goals which are then tested for practicality through the use of experimentation, learning and reflexivity. The model is often discussed in reference to sustainable development and the possible use of the model as a method for change.\n\nKey principles to transition management as a form of governance:\n\n\nThere have been numerous societal transitions in the past, studied examples include the transition from horse-drawn carriage to motorised cars and the change from physical telegraphy to the electric telephone. There are a number of theories that muse over how transition management evolved into being. One school of thought identifies the sociological aspect of transition as deeply rooted within population dynamics and the evolution of society from high birth rate/high death rate to low birth rate/low death rate. Other theorists consider that transition management has its basis within systems theory and the co-evolution of social and technical factors within the system. Most agree that the shift in the political landscape, from a centralised government to a more liberal, market-based structure has allowed new forms of bottom-up governance styles to rise to prominence and a break from dominant approaches. The most notable use of Transition Management can be established through its development into a practical tool by the Dutch Government to manage the radical transformation of their energy systems in the early 2000s. It was introduced into national policy in the Netherlands in the fourth National Environmental Policy Plan based on a report by Jan Rotmans, Rene Kemp, Frank Geels, Geert Verbong and Marjolein van Asselt.\n\nTransition management is an approach for tackling the complex issue of sustainable development. Sustainable development in itself is a dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-level problem that is in a constant state of flux. Critics consider that the current political system is insufficiently equipped to deal with the complexity of the issue and that incremental changes will not address the fundamental system failures that underpin the issue. As an alternative to traditional politics, Transition Management will seek to steer development in a more sustainable direction by identifying and fundamentally restructuring the unsustainable systems that underpin our society. The goal of transition management is geared towards enabling, facilitating and guiding the social, technical and political transformations required by embedded societal systems to bring about sustainability. The need for such a model of governance has arisen through the persistence of problems which have developed to span multi-actors, multi-levels and multi-domains. The inherent complexity of society (from the difference of perspectives, norms and values) added to the intricacy of modern-day issues requires a new form of governance. Therefore, transition management recognises the need to address this problem on the multiple levels and dimensions in which it manifests. The approach seeks to widen participation by encouraging bottom-up approaches that are supported in a top-down manner. The synergy gained from utilising transition management to provide a novel approach to the complex issue of Sustainable Development could be essential if progress is to be made on the issue.\n\nUnlike traditional forms of regulation that use command and control techniques, transition management does not seek to control the uncertainties of change but steer, indirectly influence and redirect the choices of actors towards sustainability. In the long-term, transition management will seek to completely transform the system through the process of creative destruction, much of the literature considers that only the radical rebuilding of our society's systems will be able to transcend the stable lock-in to unsustainable systems which has been systematically reinforced by aspects of the landscape and regime levels.\nMost literature recognises that there are three separate levels that transition management must work within; Landscape, Regime and Niche:.\n\n\nThese processes occur within the wider political, cultural and economic background termed the socio-technical landscape. The landscape is an external backdrop to the interplay of actors at the regime and niche level. Changes can occur in the landscape but much more slowly than regime level. One such change is the increase in environmental awareness. This socio-cultural process is leading to pressure on numerous regimes (aviation, agriculture etc.) whilst providing openings for new technologies to establish themselves.\n\n\nTechnological regimes are defined as a set of rules embedded in an engineering community's institutions and infrastructure which shape technological innovations. Geels expanded the focus from engineers to include a wider of range of social groups such as policy makers, financiers and suppliers. This web of inter-linking actors, following a set of rules was termed 'socio-technical regime', in effect, the established practices of a given system. Drawing on evolutionary economics; socio-technical regimes act as a selection and retention mechanism, filtering out the unsuccessful while incorporating more worthy innovations into the existing regime. The regime sits at the meso-level, sandwiched between the micro-level of the niche and the macro-level of the landscape. Change occurs at the regime level incrementally and is geared to achieving optimization. Radical change is potentially threatening to the vested interests of the established regime. The inertia of key industries is seen as an explanation of the difficulties in achieving transitions to sustainability.\n\n\nRadical innovations occur in niches, which act as safe environments in which breakthrough developments can grow, sheltered from the selection process that occurs at regime level. A regime may host a range of niches which generate innovations to challenge the status-quo. The military is seen as a primary niche for major technologies of the last century, supporting the development of radio, aircraft, computers and the internet. The framework of support provided can be financial (most early ventures being commercially unviable); establishing learning processes and facilitating the social networks that lead to growth.\n\nMulti-level Perspective\nGeels presents the interplay between regime, niche and landscape concepts as a multi-level perspective depicting technological transitions. The model is heuristic rather than ontological, and is an aid to better understand the process.\n\nFigure 1: A Dynamic multi-level perspective on Technological transition at: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0420240602001.png\nGeels and Schot: 2007\n\nOngoing processes at the regime and landscape level present 'windows of opportunity' for new technologies to exploit and become established. These breakthroughs tend to occur gradually through niche-accumulation. As innovations are used in multiple applications they build until achieving a critical mass. The model proposed by Geels shows how the success of a new technology requires developments across all levels to support the processes occurring within the niche (figure 1). Such an alignment is the basis of a regime shift.\n\nEach level has its own set of actors that interact in different ways, broadly they can be defined into the following categories:\n\n\nPower within the transition process is distributed rather than being top-down in nature; every actor plays a part in shaping the transition. This distributed power enables the process of mutual adaptation towards collective goals and the emergence of self-organised socio-technical 'trajectories'. However, power is not necessarily evenly distributed; relationships and the power of actors within any system are always mixed which gives rise to different forms of interaction and transition. Transition management seeks to exploit this opportunity by involving a wide selection of participants within the process. There are also a number of other important reasons for widening the participation of actors within governance. Firstly, most actors will have different preferences, a small group of actors, even if representative, will fail to identify one vision that will be accepted by everybody. By engaging all actors a plurality of visions that share common factors can be established and provide the basis for the next step. Furthermore, the use of widened participation is likely to attract stronger support and therefore less resistance to the transition. In order to fully transform the landscape level, the underpinning socio-political values and beliefs will also need to be radically rewritten, without the full involvement of society, this may be susceptible to failure. Finally it has also been considered that the heterogeneity of society allows for collective learning which spurs the development of innovations through exploration at the niche level.\n\nKemp \"et al.\" put forward a framework for identifying the different type of activities of which transition management attempts to align. These activities are broadly divided into, strategic, tactical and operational and each activity has its own actors, agendas and strategies which co-evolve.\n\nStrategic activities encompass the process of vision development; the collective action of goal and norm setting through discussion and the formulation of long-term goals. Strategic activities will lead to changes in the 'culture' of the societal system at the landscape level. The focus of this activity is long-term in scale (30 years/generations) and directed towards transition at the landscape level and the system as a whole.\n\nTactical activities relate to the interaction between actors that steers development of both institutions in the landscape level and socio-technical structures (practices, regulations, technology) at the regime level. Tactical activities focus on interpreting the visions created by strategic activities into the regime level and into the various networks, organisations and institutions involved. Tactical activities will also seek to identify the barriers that may be encountered (such as regulation, economic conditions) when interpreting these visions into the regime level. At this stage, actors that have the ability to make changes are recruited to translate the transition vision into their own agendas.\n\nFinally the operational activities constitute the process of learning by doing through experimentation and implementation at the niche level. It has a much short time span of 0‚Äì5 years and is focused on the radical innovation that will transform \"societal, technological, institutional, and behavioural practices\" that will in turn filter up and transform structures, culture and routines in the regime and landscape levels (Ibid).\n\nA further activity can be considered which establishes the process of assessment and evaluation of societal change. One can observe that reflexive activities can be both embedded within policy and regulation but also as a function of society and the evaluation of policies through the media and internet (ibid).\n\nThere are number of key aspects that differentiate transition management from other forms of governance, these differences are most apparent due to the model's prescriptive nature. With the concept still being quite fresh and only a handful of case studies to draw from the methodology is still under debate. However, most literature (See References - Loorbach 2007, Kemp, Meadowcroft 2009, Kemp and Loorbach 2003, Foxon \"et al.\" 2009) constitutes the following methodology:\n\nA problem becomes apparent to actors throughout the levels and domains; the first step involves defining the key parameters of the problem then characterising the existing regime and landscape pressures. Differences in interpretation, perceived pressures, opinions and preference ensues the construction of a plurality of visions and solutions for consideration. A 'basket of objectives' is created which express the shared visions and goals of the actors. The visions outlined are long term in nature most commonly spanning at least one generation if not more and are used to inform short-term objectives. These visions can be expressed in a number of ways; more common forms include the use of pathways, scenarios and blueprints. As an example, if the problem of the unsustainable nature of our oil-dependent nation is presented, visions that may be put forward that constitute a carbon-neutral future include; the hydrogen economy, the all-electric society and the transition to global energy infrastructure to facilitate the maximisation of renewable energy.\nAlthough each vision will require different socio-technical changes they will all seek to broadly ensure the same goals are met, for example a low or no carbon economy and a secure and reliable supply.\n\nOnce the pathways have been created short-term 'interim' objectives can be formed through Backcasting (as illustrated by the purple lines in the diagram) and actors within the niche level have the opportunity to form innovative solutions to the problem that may contribute to one of more of the pathways. Transition management will seek to identify those niches that will likely destabilise the regime level and contribute the most to its transformation. Once identified these niche opportunities can be supported by regime changes such as new policy implementation that provide new funding opportunities. In addition to deliberative steering of such choices, pressure can also filter down from the landscape level in the form of market forces which may also steer transition. Experiments within the niche level form a series of 'development rounds' which provide information to decision makers regarding the viability of different options. The information provided by the development rounds is evaluated and if the options are considered to be viable the solution is rolled out primarily on a small scale. Evaluative information can also be used to inform the overall vision created (as illustrated in red in the diagram). Eventually the development of options snowball down a particular pathway and a full system transition takes place. Not all development and transition time-scales are consistent within and between the different levels, actors and domains; some change much more quickly than others. In particular, the landscape level is much slower to change than the regime or niche levels; this has led to the concept being labelled as chaotic and non-linear in nature.\n\nAlthough being less apparent than the Dutch energy transformation, it appears that there is an increasing pressure for theorists to establish frameworks to guide a similar transition within the UK. The UK energy sector is an example of a socio-technical subsystem that exhibits strong lock-in, socially, politically and technically. The technical domain exhibits a strongly centralised infrastructure facilitated by a distribution network, socially speaking the UK energy system is heavily relied upon to provide welfare and enable economic activity. A number of landscape and regime pressures have emerged which impact on the system, primarily related to security of supply and the issue of climate change. The system has also come under pressure from the landscape level in the form of volatile market prices and the impact of the credit crunch. Meanwhile, development at the niche level has continued to build significant levels of alternative technologies and system possibilities through innovation such as offshore wind, wave and tidal power.\n\nAt the regime level, institutions such as the European Investment Bank are beginning to provide funding to facilitate the resources required to advance such niche technology. Furthermore, policies such as that of the Renewables Obligation channels funding from the energy industry to support the niche space and development. As per the method, a number of visions are currently being explored, including smart infrastructure, renewable energy alternatives and the viability of hydrogen. The UK Government uses the Renewable Obligation to 'steer' innovators towards particular solutions. More Renewable Obligation Certificates are awarded to those technologies that are pre-demonstration such as tidal and wave power, while developed technologies such as onshore wind receive less.\n\nHowever, although there are a number of indicators that suggest the transition management model of governance could emerge within the sector, (including in-depth literature outlining the methodology and possible pathways) the UK Government's current pathway (embodied in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan) does not appear to embody the radical transformation required by transition management. Instead of seeking radical socio-technical transformation, the plan seeks to incrementally improve the system by seeking behavioural changes such as energy efficiency and technical changes by enhancing the contribution of renewables. Without radical infrastructure change the UK risks locking-out a number of promising possible alternatives and may significantly increase the cost of transformation in the future when the need for fundamental systems change becomes more apparent as the current system becomes less able to meet demand.\n\n"}

Joseph Estrada, et al., 26558 Sandiganbayan, September 12, 2007) took place between 2001 and 2007 at the Sandiganbayan. Estrada, popularly called Erap, was ousted from office in 2001 during a popular uprising in Metro Manila after an aborted impeachment trial in which he was charged with plunder and perjury. Soon after his ouster, the same charges were filed against him at the Sandiganbayan.\n\nAfter a lengthy trial, the Sandiganbayan ruled Estrada not guilty of perjury while ruling him as guilty of plunder and sentenced him to reclusi√≥n perpetua. All of his co-accused were acquitted.\n\nA few months after the January 2001 popular uprising that ousted Estrada, the Philippine Ombudsman filed two charges at the Sandiganbayan on April 4, 2001; one for plunder and the other for perjury.\nThe plunder case consisted of four separate charges: acceptance of 545 million pesos from proceeds of jueteng, an illegal gambling game; misappropriation of 130 million pesos in excise taxes from tobacco; receiving a 189.7-million-peso commission from the sale of the shares of Belle Corporation, a real-estate firm; and owning some 3.2 billion pesos in a bank account under the name \"Jose Velarde\".\nThe minor charge of perjury is for Estrada under-reporting his assets in his 1999 statement of assets, liabilities and net worth and for the illegal use of an alias, namely for the Jose Velarde bank account.\n\nEstrada's son, Jinggoy Estrada, an incumbent senator, and Edward Serapio, his personal lawyer were his co-accused. Also charged were Charlie Ang, Yolanda Ricaforte, Alma Alfaro, Eleuterio Tan, Delia Rajas, and Jaime Dichaves, who was later added.\n\nThe plunder charge was based upon a complaint filed before the ombudsman by Dante Jimenez, human rights lawyer Romeo Capulong, trial lawyer Leonard de Vera, 1971 Constitutional Convention delegate Ramon A. Gonzales, lawyers Antonio T. Carpio and Dennis B. Funa. One complaint was docketed as OMB-0-00-1756 (Romeo T. Capulong, Leonard de Vera and Dennis B. Funa v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada et al.; see Victor Tan Uy v. Office of the Ombudsman et al., G.R. No. 156399-400, June 27, 2008). On January 22, 2001, two days after his implied resignation from office, President Estrada was ordered by the ombudsman to file his counter-affidavit in answer to the complaints. Finding probable cause, the complaint would be filed as Criminal Case No. 26558.\n\nThe Philippine government's prosecution team was led by Special Prosecutor Dennis Villa-Ignacio and other government lawyers. Their case against Joseph Estrada was based on the following:\n\nFormer President Joseph Estrada's defense panel, led by Atty. Estelito Mendoza, and composed of former Supreme Court justices and other celebrated Philippine lawyers based their defense on the following points:\n\nPresident Estrada recalls the Arroyos plotting with the civil society and the military in January 2000, to take over a year later; \nThe House of Representatives impeaching him without debate and voting; \nThe Senate blue-ribbon committee not hearing him out; \nThe Impeachment Court not citing for contempt the losers in a democratic debate and voting; \nand the Supreme Court conniving with the elite to swear in then-Vice-President Gloria Arroyo at noon of January 20, 2001, \n-(Manila Times, September 30, 2007)\n\n1. The whole process is against the constitution.\na) the legal possibility of removing a sitting president is by impeachment.\nPaguia, one of Estrada's lawyers, argues\nformer President Estrada was not convicted and removed by the Senate acting as an Impeachment Court, therefore it is unconstitutional to subject him to the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan. \n-(Manila Times, September 14, 2007)\n\nb) the Supreme Court relied on a biblical, not constitutional passage, with President Estrada still in the Palace\n\nc) the same Court created a special division for President Estrada (not done in the case of the Marcoses and the cronies and the military).\n\nd) Actually, the plot to oust President Estrada was planned by the then-Vice president Arroyo, who met with some political and religious leaders calling for a what she called \"Transition Government\" under her rule.\n\n2. The Sandiganbayan did not find him guilty of stealing a single centavo of public money. (Manila Times, September 30, 2007)\n\nLead counsel Estelito Mendoza insisted there is no evidence Estrada received bribe money from jueteng lords. There was also no evidence he received commission money or checks from the Belle transactions.\nThe one who admitted to receiving bribe money from gambling lords was former governor Chavit Singson of Ilocos Sur. But he was not charged as a co-conspirator. He ran for senator in May 2007 but lost.\n\n3. Fabrication of evidence:\nManrique, a former action officer of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC), narrated in his affidavit how he, sometime in the last week of October 2001, was contacted by a lawyer(State Prosecutor Dennis Villa-Ignacio) who represented himself as a member of the prosecution team in the Estrada cases.\n\nManrique said the lawyer convinced him to file another perjury case against the deposed president since the original case filed\nby the Ombudsman was deemed to be weak and insufficient in evidence.\nThe lawyer added Manrique‚Äôs complaint against Estrada had to be antedated to make it appear that even before the Ombudsman had filed his own case,\n\n4. Saguisag, one of Estrada‚Äòs lawyers said the defense will base its legal argument on the prosecution‚Äôs failure to indicate in the information that Estrada had received jueteng money ‚Äúby reason of his public office,‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere was no allegation that it was received by reason of his public office. That‚Äôs one of the elements of plunder,‚Äù (inquirer, September 2007)\n\n5. The Sandigan special graft court has an image problem. It is not perceived as being impartial or independent or even fair.\nReynato Puno has one of the worst trust ratings for a public figure.\n\nInitial reports of the nature of the conviction pronounced Estrada guilty of the PHP 545 million jueteng case and the Belle Corporation case, while the other two charges were dropped.\n\nThe sentence of reclusi√≥n perpetua also includes the return to the government of the over PHP 200 million Erap Muslim Youth foundation and PHP 189 million Jose Velarde monies, the penalty of civil interdiction, and perpetual absolute exclusion from public office.\n\nThe Court has also ordered the arrest of all the other co-defendants in the case.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Joseph Estrada was acquitted of perjury but found guilty of plunder and sentenced to reclusion perpetua with the accessory penalties of perpetual disqualification from public office and forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, Sandiganbayan's Presiding Justice Teresita De Castro and two other magistrates unanimously acquitted his son, Senator Jinggoy Estrada, and a lawyer Edward Serapio of plunder charges. The Fallo of the 262-page Decision declared the forfeiture in favor of the government: P542.701 million (bank accounts including interest), P189 million (Jose Velarde accounts including interest) and the Boracay mansion in New Manila, Quezon City.\n\nOnly the fallo or dispositive part of two judgments were read (resulting to only 15 minutes judicial proceedings). During the reading of the judgment, witnesses said Joseph Estrada cried; his wife, Luisa Ejercito Estrada, Jackie Ejercito Lopez, San Juan Mayor Joseph Victor \"JV\" Ejercito, (Estrada's son with Guia Gomez), other family members and mistresses (including, Laarni Enriquez) all wept during the promulgation by the clerk.\n\nEstrada's lawyer Estelito Mendoza stated that Estrada will file a motion for reconsideration (before September 27) of the 262-page Judgment and then appeal the verdict to the High Tribunal. The Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it will support a presidential pardon for Estrada. Jinggoy Estrada said \"The people will receive this with moral outrage and disgust. The time of reckoning will come. That time may not be too far now. This verdict is intended to legitimize the occupancy of an illegal tenant in Malacanang.\"\n\nEstrada, in Filipino \"barong tagalog\" (pineapple fibre dress shirt and cream trousers) with his trademark wristband stated that \"I thought the role of justice would prevail here but really it's a kangaroo court.\" President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo stated that the court's decision must be accepted: \"We hope and pray that the rule of law will prevail.\" Estrada's counsel Rene A.V. Saguisag issued the statement:\"It's victors' justice. It's ruling class justice. The special division (of the court) was programmed to convict. We never had a chance.\" Estrada will appeal the verdict and would be under automatic review at the Supreme Court of the Philippines.\n\nEstrada told AFP that he was resigned for the latest drama in his presidency: \"last and best performance of my life.\" The prosecution's lead counsel Dennis Villa-Ignacio proudly asserted: \"It shows that our judicial system really works. This is the last chance for the state to show that we can do it, that we can charge, prosecute and convict a public official regardless of his stature.\"\n\nJoseph Estrada rose from obscurity to having been top Filipino film star, then hit the mark, by claiming the presidency until destiny sent him to jail. He stated to AFP \"I feel depressed, but it's my style not to show it.\" Before the release of the fatalistic judgment, he warned that he prevent his fans from making street protests.\n\nEstrada returned to his villa in Tanay, Rizal (driven on from a golf cart), to the helicopter) The court permitted him to return to his villa, \"until further orders\".\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. embassy stated that the arrival of the USS \"Chung-Hoon\" and USS \"Milius\", missile destroyers was a \"goodwill visit\" to strengthen the ties between the U.S. and the Philippines.\n\nOn September 26, 2007, Joseph Estrada appealed by filing a 63-page motion for reconsideration of the Sandiganbayan judgment penned by Teresita de Castro (submitting 5 legal grounds). Estrada alleged that the court erred \"when it convicted him by acquitting his alleged co-conspirators.\"\n\nOn October 5, 2007, the Sandiganbayan's Special Division ruled to have set for October 19, oral argument (instead of a defense reply) on Joseph Estrada‚Äôs motion for reconsideration. Estrada asked court permission to attend the hearing, since it ordered the prosecution to file comment before October 11.\n\nOn October 22, 2007, Acting Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera stated that Joseph Estrada is seeking a \"full, free, and unconditional pardon\" from President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Estrada's lawyer Jose Flaminiano wrote Arroyo: \"The time has come to end President Estrada's fight for justice and vindication before the courts. Today [Monday], we filed a withdrawal of his Motion for Reconsideration.\" Estrada, 70, stressed the \"delicate condition\" of his mother in asking for pardon.\n\nOn October 25, 2007, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo granted executive clemency to Joseph Estrada based on the recommendation by the Department of Justice. Acting Executive Secretary and Press Secretary Ignacio R. Bunye quoted the signed order: \"In view hereof in pursuant of the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant Executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\"\nBunye noted that Estrada committed in his application not to seek public office, and he would be free from his Tanay resthouse on October 26, noon. On October 26, 2007, after almost seven years of detention, Joseph Estrada was finally released after the Sandiganbayan promulgated the resolution.\n\nOn September 14, 2007, chief presidential legal counsel Sergio Antonio Apostol officially stated that Sandiganbayan Justices Teresita de Castro, Diosdado Peralta and Francisco Villaruz Jr. should decline Judicial and Bar Council nomination and await other vacancies to ease pressure on President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo: \"Para hindi na maipit ang Presidente (In order to spare the President from pressure), they should withdraw their nomination. Parang iyong nangyari kay Justice (Gregory) Ong (Remember what happened in Justice Gregory S. Ong‚Äôs case) ...It‚Äôs a sacrifice on her part..Hindi niya maiwanan (ang posisyon) (She cannot leave the Sandiganbayan) because of the case of Joseph Estrada - Erap (Estrada‚Äôs nickname).\" In the aftermath of the verdict, De Castro, Villaruz and Peralta are now at the receiving end of two unsolicited advices from key officials. Senate of the Philippines Majority Leader Francis Pangilinan, ex-officio member, Judicial and Bar Council stated that the three Sandiganbayan justices \"should have the delicadeza [gentleness] not to accept a promotion to the highest tribunal to dispel any suspicion that they pronounced Mr. Estrada guilty expecting a reward from Palace ... We do not want to see a cloud of suspicion over the appointees to the Supreme Court. They should always be above suspicion.\"\n\nOn November 5, 2007, Senator Jinggoy Estrada, in a privileged speech vowed to block the appointment to the Supreme Court of Sandiganbayan Justices Teresita De Castro and Francisco Villaruz, Jr. (who convicted his father - President Joseph Estrada). Jinggoy said that: \"Such a promotion would seem like a reward in exchange for the guilty verdict against the deposed President. We are convinced, then and now, that the special court created to exclusively try the case of President Estrada was established precisely to convict him, which is what exactly happened.\" Also, Joseph Estrada opposed court seizure of his assets, stating that: \"These properties are mine. I acquired them way back when I was still a movie actor.\"\n\nOn December 4, Sandiganbayan Special Division chairperson Teresita de Castro was appointed as the new associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.\n\nOn January 10, 2008, Edgardo Urieta, Sandiganbayan chief of the Sheriff and Security Services Office released the two-page report (based on thirteen-page Banco de Oro to the Sandiganbayan Special Division) which discovered intact due to the 2001 levy by BIR distraint - P 1.107 billion ($1 = P 41) account of Joseph Estrada: P500 million - \"promissory note and chattel mortgage\"; 450 million shares of Waterfront Philippines valued at P 427.5 million; and 300 million shares of Wellex Industries worth P 84 million; cash deposits in a common trust fund investment account of P 95.76 million.\n\nThe Philippine government, through Presidential Spokesperson Ignacio Bunye has issued a statement to the effect of the government's respect and deference to the authority of the Sandiganbayan, and the hope that this \"sad\" episode in the country's history will not \"permanently distract\" the country from peace and progress.\n\nPresident Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo canceled a scheduled attendance at a gathering of business leaders in Makati City that afternoon due to security reasons. President Arroyo was scheduled to drop by the Philippine Mid-Year Economic Briefing which was to be held 1:30 p.m. at the Rizal Ballroom of the Makati Shangri-La Hotel.\n\nThe Philippine Stock Exchange recovered from a two-day slump, closing at 3,307.60 points, up by 1.21%. The Philippine peso moderately strengthened against the US dollar.\n\n\n\n"}

The Turkish community began to settle in the region in the 15th century under Ottoman rule, however many Turks emigrated to Turkey when Bosnia and Herzegovina came under Austro-Hungarian rule.\n\nWhen the Ottoman Empire conquered the Bosnian kingdom in 1463, a significant Turkish community arrived in the region. The Turkish community grew steadily throughout the Ottoman rule of Bosnia; however, after the Ottomans were defeated in the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì13), the majority of Turks, along with other Muslims living in the region, left their homes and migrated to Turkey as \"Muhacirs\" (Muslim refugees from non-Muslim countries).\n\nIn 2003 the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the Law on the Protection of Rights of Members of National Minorities. According to the Law, the Turkish minority's cultural, religious, educational, social, economic, and political freedoms are protected by the State.\n\nThe Turkish language is officially recognized as a minority language of Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, under Article 2, paragraph 2, of the 2010 ratification.\n\nAccording to the 2013 census, 1,233 people (817 males, 416 females), 887 of whom lived in the Sarajevo Canton, declared Turkish as their mother tongue whereas 1,108 (738 males, 370 females), 970 of whom lived in the Sarajevo Canton, declared themselves as ethnic Turks. \n\nThe Turkish minority practice the Sunni branch of Islam but tend to be highly secular.\n\nTurkish community in Bosnia is well provided, due to historical strong bond between both countries.\n\nAccording to the 1991 population census 267 Turks were living in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the 2013 Bosnian census gave a number of 1,108, almost all in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1,097 people). More than eighty percent of all Turks in Bosnia and Herzegovina live in the capital Sarajevo (887 people).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35970426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35970426", "title": "Yemenite Children Affair", "text": "Yemenite Children Affair\n\nThe Yemenite Children Affair () refers to the disappearance of between 1500 and 5000 babies and toddlers of new immigrants to the newly founded state of Israel from 1948 to 1954. The majority of immigrants were from Yemen, with considerable numbers coming from Iraq, Morocco, Tunisia and the Balkans. According to low estimates, one in eight children of Yemenite families disappeared. Hundreds of documented statements made over the years by the parents of these infants allege that their children were removed from them. No death certificates were issued, nor did parents receive any information from Israeli and Jewish organizations as to what had happened to their infants. \n\nWidespread accusations continue that the infants were given or sold to childless Holocaust survivors in a covert systematic operation. Conclusions reached by three separate official commissions set up to investigate the issue unanimously found that the majority of the children were buried having died from diseases. DNA paternity testing has been able to confirm that, in some cases, adopted children trying to track down their biological parents were born to Yemenite families who had been informed that their children had died. Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described the issue as ‚Äòan open wound that continues to bleed‚Äô for the many families not knowing what happened to the children who disappeared.\n\nThe Yemenite community was well established in Ottoman and then British Mandate Palestine by the turn of the century. The State of Israel was created in 1948 and almost immediately began to receive refugees who included both several hundred thousand Holocaust survivors and Jews who had become refugees as a result of the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, which resulted in about 700,000 new immigrants from the Muslim world. \n\nConsequently, the population of Israel rose from 800,000 to two million between 1948 and 1958. During this period, food, clothes, and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the Austerity Period. Between 1948‚Äì1970, approximately 1,151,029 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel. Many arrived as penniless refugees and were housed in temporary camps known as \"ma'abarot\"; by 1952, over 200,000 immigrants were living in these tent cities.\n\nMany of the complaints have common characteristics:\n\nThe mystery surrounding the disappearance of these children has led to the claim that while many children were recorded as having died, in fact they were either kidnapped or were adopted by rich Ashkenazi Jews in Israel or abroad. The affair has been widely covered in the Israeli media through the decades, and so far four official investigating committees have been established to investigate the claims. The committees have investigated many hundreds of cases, and determined that the vast majority of children actually died and only in a minority cases they did not find enough evidence to determine what really happened.\n\nThe peak of the public outcry on the matter occurred in 1994 when Yemenite Rabbi Uzi Meshulam established an \"armed sect\" of radical Yemenite Jews in his garden, who barricaded themselves in his home and violently resisted Israeli law enforcement while demanding that the Israeli government establish a State Commission of Inquiry to examine the matter.\n\nSince the 1960s, the Yemenite children affair has repeatedly been the subject of public debate every few years. As a result, through the years three formal inquiry committees and one public inquiry committee were established to investigate the matter and to expose the truth on this issue.\n\nIn 1967, the Bahlul-Minkowski Committee was established. After examining 342 cases of disappearances, the committee determined that in 316 of these cases the children died for certain, and that in 2 instances the children were adopted; the other 24 cases were inconclusive.\n\nThe Israeli government led by Yitzhak Shamir established a commission headed by Justice Moshe Shalgi which lasted four years. This committee received new evidence on 301 children, and determined that in 65 of these cases their fate was unknown. It determined that in all the other cases the children did die. The report was met with dissatisfaction by some Knesset members with David Mena saying, 'The report doesn't reflect the real picture of the Yemenite children's disappearance.' Knesset member and chair of the interior committee, Dov Shilanski, who had overseen testimony given said, ‚ÄòI personally believe, in contradiction to the Shalgi report, that there were more than a few cases of kidnapping of Yemenite babies.‚Äô\n\nIn 1995, immediately after publication of the Shalgi Committee's conclusions, and following a public uproar, the Kedmi Commission was established. Its conclusions were published in 2001. It found that in the state‚Äôs first 6 years, as many as 5000 children may have disappeared. Hundreds of thousands of documents relevant to testimonies and evidence were placed under lock for 70 years and will not be available to the public until 2071. The committee examined more than 800 cases, and did not manage to reach absolute conclusions in 56 of these cases. The committee determined that in 750 cases the children actually died.\n\nIn June 2016, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Tzachi Hanegbi, a government minister, to re-examine the evidence in the three previous inquiries. Netanyahu said it would \"right an historic wrong\", and marked a new era of transparency. The government opened up nearly all of the archives of the inquiries putting them online. \n\nDisturbing revelations followed in a special Knesset committee about medical experiments that had been carried out on the Yemenite children. Prior testimony given under oath during the previous inquiries revealed that many children had died as a consequence of medical negligence. Further testimony revealed that four undernourished babies died after being administered an experimental protein injection. Violating Jewish tradition, post-mortem examinations were carried out on children who were then buried in mass graves. Children's hearts were removed in some cases and given to US doctors researching the near absence of heart disease found in Yemen.\n\nIn 2016 after having re-examined evidence given to a commission of inquiry in the late 1990s, Cabinet Minister Tzachi Hanegbi told Israeli TV: \"They took the children and gave them away. I don't know where.\" The minister admitted that at least \"hundreds\" of children were taken without their parent‚Äôs consent, marking the first time such a public admission had been made by a government official.\n\nAfter the issue resurfaced, a \"Haaretz\" investigation found that dozens of Ashkenazi children vanished in a manner similar to the way the Yemenite children did.\n\nOn 23 January 2018, after staging a mass demonstration in Petach-Tikvah, Yemenite families of children believed to have been abducted were given permission by the State Attorney's Office to exhume 18 graves said to be those of their missing loved ones. Their hope is that, by exhuming their bodies for DNA testing, if the graves should prove to be empty or that the genetic findings do not match those of their siblings, it would give undisputed evidence of a cover-up in the disappearance of these children.\n\n\n"}
