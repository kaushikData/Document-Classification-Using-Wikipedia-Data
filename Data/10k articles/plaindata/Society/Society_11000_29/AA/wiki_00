Although eventually ascribed to former members of Nadhim Kzar's (chief of the Directorate of General Security) police force, at the time there was widespread fear amongst the Baghdad population about the nature of the crimes.\n\nAbu Tubar has achieved the title \"hatchet man\" in early 1970s. His real name is حاتم كاظم هضم (Hatem Kazem Hathom); born 1932 in the city of Babylon, Hilla in Iraq. He is known as the man who brought fear and terror to the civilians of Iraq. He has a reputation of murdering families by chopping them with his hatchet. He usually begins his crimes with a strange phone call, usually when the victim is alone at home. The call consists of useless conversation, threatening, and cursing. After the phone call, there is a knock on the door, after which the crime begins.\n\nThe citizens of Iraq at the time became worried and very fearful. People in Baghdad became more cautious; they became very protective. Individuals no longer went out alone, began to trim any trees and bushes around the neighbourhood to have a clear view of any potential hiding areas, and added more lights to keep them on all night for security. Being used to the safe environment in Iraq, these acts of Abu Tubar created tension and anxiety, which paralyzed the country. People began to create curfews for themselves and locked their homes more regularly. Television programs began to give safety instructions to viewers and so did call-in shows to train the citizens what to do if they saw him or any suspicious acts being found.\n\nHe lived in Babylon, Hilla and came from a very well-known and generous family in Iraq. He graduated elementary school in 1946 and graduated middle school in 1949. After that, he went to a police school in Hilla and ended up graduating in 1951 with a commissioner rank of police of Hilla but was fired in 1952 for professional reasons. He immediately returned to college to study the air force, however he was expelled in 1956 due to purposely fooling around in the air with the training planes. Hatem knew multiple languages, including Arabic, English, German, Persian, and even Kurdish. After getting expelled, he traveled to Kuwait to study free business in 1957, then returned to Iraq in 1959 to work as a collections accountant in Kirkuk. He got sentenced two and a half years in jail due to damaging (?) the company's state funds. After serving the time in jail, he left to explore Europe, spending most of his time in West Germany, Munich. Hatem began to smuggle weapons and cars from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Syria, and Turkey.\n\nOn March 30, 1974; 2:55 P.M. there was a report of a thief entering a neighbour's house that belonged to Doctor Joseph Paul Pedros Jadraji. The police came in time to catch the thief but their records showed Hatem as one of the air forces. This allowed him to keep lying about what he had done until they asked him to show them his house. They found many stolen items in his home, from expensive radios to jewellery and clothing. He admitted on national television the crimes he committed, as well the help he received from his two brothers, Galib and Hazim, his nephew Hussain, and his wife. When questioned about his motives Abu Tubar said he had two reasons why he killed people: one, to move freely in the house and enable him to steal anything; two, he admitted to having a psychological problem that sometimes he enjoyed killing, even drinking some of the victims' blood at times. His death took place in 1980, sentenced to death by hanging in Abu Ghraib prison.\n"}

The triangle takes a hierarchical view of management structure, with many operational decisions at the bottom, some tactical decisions in the middle and few but important strategic decisions at the top of the triangle. The higher in the triangle an item is, the more scope it covers and less precise it becomes. As items move down they become more detailed and apply more precisely.\n\nIt came to the attention of the information systems community through the work of George Gorry and Michael Scott Morton.\n"}

{"id": "838389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=838389", "title": "Bavarians", "text": "Bavarians\n\nBavarians (Bavarian: \"Boarn\", Standard German: \"Bayern\") are nation and ethnographic group of Germans of the Bavaria region, a state within Germany. The group's dialect or speech is known as the Bavarian language, native to Altbayern (\"Old Bavaria\"), roughly the territory of the Electorate of Bavaria in the 17th century.\n\nLike the neighboring Swabians and Austrians, Bavarians are traditionally Catholic. In much of \"Altbayern\", membership in the Catholic church remains above 70%,\nand the center-right Christian Social Union in Bavaria (successor of the Bavarian People's Party of 1919–1933) has traditionally been the strongest party in the Landtag, and also the party of all Ministers-President of Bavaria since 1946, with the single exception of Wilhelm Hoegner, 1954–1957.\n\nThere is no ethno-linguistic distinction between Bavarians and Austrians. The territory of Bavaria has changed significantly over German history; in the 19th century the Kingdom of Bavaria acquired substantial territories of Franconia and Swabia, while having to return territories to Austria who had become Bavarian only a few years earlier. Thus, only three of the seven administrative regions of the state of Bavaria are culturally Bavarian: Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern), Lower Bavaria (Niederbayern) and the Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz), to the exclusion of Bavarian Franconia (historically inhabited by Franks) and Bavarian Swabia (inhabited by Swabians).\n\nThe Bavarian language is divided into three main dialects:\n\n\"Bavarii\" or \"Baiuvarii\" was the term for a population from the Bohemian Forest area (which had been the territory of the Boii during antiquity) from the 6th century; the name is Latinized from a possible self-designation \"*Baio-warioz\", apparently intended to mean \"men of Bohemia\". \"Bohemia\" (Boiohaemum), apparently meaning \"Boii home\" in a Germanic language, was a term already mentioned by Tacitus in his \"Germania\" at the end of the 1st century AD, by which time the Celtic Boii had already long left the area, leaving it to be settled by Suevic Germanic groups in close contact with the Romans, such as the Marcomanni. On the southern side of the river Danube was the Roman controlled province of Raetia.\n\nBavarians are first mentioned in the mid 6th century, in the foothills north of the Alps, on both sides of the Danube river. It is difficult to distinguish the mobile and mixing groups of the Danube in this period archaeologically. The timing comes after the period when the neighbouring Alamanni (to the west) and Thuringians (to the north) had come under Frankish hegemony, and in Italy the kingdoms of Theoderic and Odoacer had come to and end, creating a new power vacuum in the Alpine region. They seem to have been closely related to the Lombards who were developing as a force to the east of them. Their legal system shows heavy Roman influence, and their unification appears to have been under a Duke installed by the Franks. (Old Bavarian law codes refer to five main lineages.)\n\nThe Danubian frontier between the Roman empire and \"Germania\" had by this time become a region where older populations had been added to significantly by generations of Roman border troops, Germanic clients, and then various \"barbarian\" peoples from outside the empire, some of whom had been under the hegemony of Attila the Hun. \"Elbe Germans\", came from the Elbe river to the north, which was under Thuringian rule, and is where the Lombards had also been. But also more northern groups had moved along the Elbe from the direction of the North Sea, as did some Saxons who joined the Lombards, and possibly the Heruls. Also, East Germanic groups such as the Goths had entered the Pannonian region east of the Bavarians in the generations leading up to the empire of Attila. These peoples had not only contributed to the Hunnic empire, but also sometimes been settled peacefully as Roman \"foederati\".\n\nAlso entering the area, more contemporary with the Bavarians and Lombards, were Slavs, who particularly settled the Upper Palatinate as well as around Regensburg itself (distr. Großprüfening)\n\nNeighboring the emerging Bavarian people in the 6th to 7th centuries were the Alamanni to the west (with the Lech River as boundary, which remains a dialectal division today), and Thuringians to the north, both dominated to some extent by the Franks as were the Bavarians. (In the late 7th century however, there was a period where Radulf, King of Thuringia rebelled and some independence was returned to these three regions for a while.) Slavs were settling to the north-east, and Goths and Langobards to the east and south were later displaced by Slavs and Magyars.\n\nMuch like was the case in neighboring Alemannia, Bavaria was nominally Christian by virtue of being ruled by Christian dukes from the 6th century, but Christianization of its population was a gradual process lasting throughout the 7th century and into the 8th; Saint Corbinian was sent by Pope Gregory II to minister to duke Grimoald and work towards the evangelization of Bavaria; he became the first bishop of Freising. A Diocese of Laureacum (Lorch) had been in existence since the 4th century, in the 8th century moved to Passau, which became a bridge-head for the Christianization of Austria and Hungary. The Bishopric of Regensburg was founded in 739 by Boniface. The Lex Baiuvariorum was a codex of Germanic law, comprising 23 articles of traditional law recorded in the 740s. Bavaria within the Carolingian Empire was bordering on Swabia in the west, Thuringia in the north, Lombardy in the south and Slavic Carinthia in the east.\n\nThe Duchy of Bavaria was a stem duchy of the Holy Roman Empire, established in the 10th century, derived from an earlier duchy ruled by the Frankish Agilolfings during the 6th to 8th centuries.\nThe Margraviate of Austria was formed an eastern march to the Duchy of Bavaria in 976, and became a duchy in its own right, the Duchy of Austria, in 1156, in the 13th century falling under the dominion of the House of Habsburg.\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies (or \"partial duchies\", \"Teilherzogtümer\") existed after the division of 1392: Lower Bavaria-Straubing, lower Bavaria-Landshut, Bavaria-Ingolstadt and Bavaria-Munich.\n\nMunich, now the capital and cultural center of Bavaria, was founded in the high medieval period, and was the capital \nof the \"partial duchy\" of Bavaria-Munich 1392–1503. In 1503, Bavaria was re-united by Duke Albrecht IV of Bavaria-Munich (although the formerly Bavarian offices Kufstein, Kitzbühel and Rattenberg in Tirol were lost in 1504) and established Munich as the capital of all of Bavaria in 1506.\nIn 1623, Bavaria was elevated to Electorate (\"Kurfürstentum\").\n\nThe Kingdom of Bavaria was established at the Peace of Pressburg (1805), in the wake of the French victory at Austerlitz. The kingdom's territory fluctuated greatly over the following years, eventually fixed at the Treaty of Paris (1814), which established most of what remain the borders of the modern state. The kingdom in 1837 was divided into eight administrative regions (\"Regierungsbezirke\"), \"Upper Bavaria\", \"Lower Bavaria\", \"Franconia\", \"Swabia\", \"Upper Palatinate\" and \"Palatinate\". \nLudwig I of Bavaria changed his royal titles to \"Ludwig, King of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia, Duke in Swabia and Count Palatinate of the Rhine\".\n\nAs of 1818, the total population of the kingdom was at 3.7 million, rising to 4.4 million by 1840 and to 6.2 million by 1900, reaching 6.5 million in 1910. Modern Bavaria has 12.5 million inhabitants (as of 2012); \nthe population of Altbayern or Bavaria proper is at 6.7 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "467604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=467604", "title": "Chink", "text": "Chink\n\nChink (also chinki, chinky, chinkie, chinka, chinkapoo or chinker) is an English-language ethnic slur usually referring to a person of Chinese ethnicity. The word is also sometimes indiscriminately used against people of East Asian appearance. The use of the term is considered offensive.\n\nVarious dictionaries provide different etymologies of the word \"chink\"; for example, that it originated from the Chinese courtesy \"ching-ching\", that it evolved from the word \"China\", or that it was an alteration of \"Qing\" (\"Ch'ing\"), as in the Qing Dynasty.\n\nAnother possible origin is that \"chink\" evolved from the Indo-Iranian word for China. That word is now pronounced similarly in various Indo-European languages. But this also comes from the Chin dynasty.\n\nThe first recorded use of the word \"chink\" is from approximately 1880. As far as can be ascertained, its adjective form, \"chinky,\" first appeared in print in 1878. The derogatory word Chinky remains in use in Britain as slang for Chinese food.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, many white North American perceived Chinese immigration as a threat to their living standards. However, Chinese workers were still desired on the West Coast due to a persistent labor shortage. Chinese butcher crews were held in such high esteem that when Edmund A. Smith patented his mechanized fish-butchering machine in 1905, he named it the \"Iron Chink\", which is seen by some as symbolic of anti-Chinese racism during the era. Usage of the word continued, such as with the story \"The Chink and the Child\" by Thomas Burke, which was later adapted to film by D.W. Griffith. Griffith altered the story to be more racially sensitive and renamed it to \"Broken Blossoms\".\n\nAlthough \"chink\" refers to those appearing to be of Chinese descent, the term has also been directed towards people of other East and Southeast Asian ethnicities. Literature and film about the Vietnam war contain examples of this usage, including the film \"Platoon\" (1986) and the play \"Sticks and Bones\" (1971, also later filmed).\n\n\"Chink\" has been compared in degree of offensiveness to terms such as \"nigger\", dago, Jap, and \"kike\", as well as \"paki\" (Pakistani).\nSimilar to the controversial reappropriation of the word \"nigger\", the word \"chink\" has sometimes been used in a positive manner. For example, Leehom Wang, a Taiwanese American musician, named his Asian hip-hop fusion genre \"chinked-out\" in order to neutralize the term. Eventually Wang hopes the term will become \"cool.\"\n\nRacism against Chinese people exists in Australia, as in other English-speaking countries. The terms Chinaman and \"chink\" became intertwined, as some Australians used both with hostile intent when referring to members of the country's Chinese population, which had swelled significantly during the Gold Rush era of the 1850s and 1860s.\n\nAssaults on Chinese miners and racially motivated riots and public disturbances were not infrequent occurrences in Australia's mining districts in the second half of the 19th century. There was some resentment, too, of the fact that Chinese miners and laborers tended to send their earnings back home to their families in China rather than spending them in Australia and supporting the local economy.\n\nIn the popular Sydney \"Bulletin\" magazine in 1887, one author wrote: \"No nigger, no chink, no lascar, no kanaka (laborer from the South Pacific islands), no purveyor of cheap labour, is an Australian.\" Eventually, since-repealed federal government legislation was passed to restrict non-white immigration and thus protect the jobs of Anglo-Celtic Australian workers from \"undesirable\" competition.\n\nIn India, the ethnic slur \"chinki\" (or \"chinky\") is frequently directed against people with East Asian features, including people from North-East India and Nepal, who are often mistaken for Chinese.\n\nIn 2012, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs recognized use of the term \"chinki\" to refer to a member of the Scheduled Tribes (especially in the North-East) as a criminal offense under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with a penalty of up to five years in jail. The Ministry further warned that they would very seriously review any failure of the police to enforce this interpretation of the Act.\n\nThe 1969 top 3 UK hit single for Blue Mink, \"Melting Pot\", has the lyric: \"take a pinch of white man/Wrap him up in black skin. [...] Mixed with yellow Chinkees. You know you lump it all together/And you got a recipe for a get-along scene/Oh what a beautiful dream/If it could only come true\". Whilst at the time expressing racial harmony, a modern audience may find the use of the word insensitive, undercutting the song's intent.\n\nIn 1999, an exam given to students in Scotland was criticized for containing a passage that students were told to interpret containing the word \"chinky\". This exam was taken by students all over Scotland, and Chinese groups expressed offence at the use of this passage. The examinations body apologized, calling the passage's inclusion \"an error of judgement.\"\n\nThe Pekin, Illinois High School teams were officially known as the \"Pekin Chinks\" until 1981, when the school administration changed the name to the \"Pekin Dragons\". The event received national attention.\n\nNew York City radio station, Hot 97, came under criticism for airing the \"Tsunami Song\". Referring to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, in which over an estimated 200,000 people died, the song used the phrase \"screaming chinks\" along with other offensive lyrics. The radio station fired a co-host and producer, and indefinitely suspended radio personality Miss Jones, who was later reinstated. Members of the Asian American community said Miss Jones' reinstatement condoned hate speech.\n\nSarah Silverman appeared on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" in 2001, stirring up controversy when the word \"chink\" was used without the usual bleep appearing over ethnic slurs on network television. The controversy led Asian activist and community leader Guy Aoki to appear on the talk show \"Politically Incorrect\" along with Sarah Silverman. Guy Aoki alleged that Silverman did not believe that the term was offensive.\n\nA Philadelphia eatery, Chink's Steaks, created controversy, appearing in Philadelphia Daily News and other newspapers. The restaurant was asked by Asian community groups to change the name. The restaurant was named after the original Jewish-American owner's nickname, \"Chink\", derived from the ethnic slur due to his \"slanty eyes\". The restaurant was renamed Joe's in 2013.\n\nDuring early 2000, University of California, Davis experienced a string of racial incidents and crimes between Asian and white students, mostly among fraternities. Several incidents included \"chink\" and other racial epithets being shouted among groups, including the slurs being used during a robbery and assault on an Asian fraternity by 15 white males. The incidents motivated a school-wide review and protest to get professional conflict resolution and \"culturally sensitive\" mediators.\n\nIn February 2012, ESPN fired one employee and suspended another for using the headline \"Chink in the Armor\" in reference to Jeremy Lin, an American basketball player of Taiwanese and Chinese descent. While the word \"chink\" also refers to a crack or fissure and \"chink in the armor\" is an idiom and common sports cliche, referring to a vulnerability, the \"apparently intentional\" double entendre of its use in reference to an Asian athlete was viewed as offensive.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30138393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30138393", "title": "Criminal law of the United States", "text": "Criminal law of the United States\n\nResponsibility for criminal law and criminal justice in the United States is shared between the states and the federal government.\n\nThe federal government and all the states rely on the following.\n\nCommon law is law developed by judges through legal opinions, as opposed to statutes adopted through the legislative process or regulations issued by the executive branch. A common law crime is thus a crime which was originally defined by judges.\n\nCommon law crimes no longer exist at the federal level, because of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"United States v. Hudson and Goodwin\", 11 U.S. 32 (1812). The validity of common law crimes varies at the state level. Although most states have abolished common law crimes, some have enacted \"reception\" statutes recognizing common law crimes when no similar statutory crime exists.\n\nAll 50 states have their own penal codes. Therefore, for any particular crime somewhere, it would be necessary to look it up in that jurisdiction. However, statutes derive from the common law. For example, if a state's murder statute does not define \"human being,\" that state's courts will rely on the common-law definition.\n\nThe states, since they possess the police power, have the most general power to pass criminal laws in the United States. The federal government, since it can only exercise those powers granted to it by the Constitution, can only pass criminal laws which are related to the powers granted to Congress. For example, drug crimes, which comprise a large percentage of federal criminal cases, are subject to federal control because drugs are a commodity for which there is an interstate market, thus making controlled substances subject to regulation by Congress in the Controlled Substances Act which was passed under the authority of the Commerce Clause. \"Gonzales v. Raich\" affirmed Congress's power to regulate drug possession under the Controlled Substances Act under the powers granted to it by the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe Model Penal Code (\"MPC\") was created by the American Law Institute (\"ALI\") in 1962. In other areas of law, the ALI created Restatements of Law, usually referred to just as Restatements. For example, there is a Restatement of Contracts and a Restatement of Torts. The MPC is their equivalent for criminal law.\n\nMany states have wholly or largely adopted the MPC. Others have implemented it in part, and still others have not adopted any portion of it. However, even in jurisdictions where it has not been adopted, the MPC is often cited as persuasive authority in the same way that Restatements are in other areas of law.\n\nAn overarching concept in American criminal law is that people may not be punished for committing merely immoral or unethical acts. They can only be punished if that act has been announced beforehand as a crime.\n\nIn the United States, the adversarial system is used. The prosecution must prove each element of the alleged crime beyond a reasonable doubt for conviction.\n\nCrimes can generally be reduced to \"actus reus\" elements and \"mens rea\" elements. \"Actus reus\" elements are elements which describe conduct. \"Mens rea\" elements are elements which identify a particular mental state. \n\nThe phrase \"actus reus\" is typically translated as \"guilty act.\"\n\nOrdinarily, a voluntary act refers to commission. However, as discussed below, some crimes do punish failure to act. A status is not a voluntary act. For example, no law will be constitutional that makes it a crime to be \"addicted\" to illegal drugs, as opposed to \"using\" them, as happened in \"Robinson v. California\".\n\nFailure to do something can occasionally be criminal. For example, not paying one's taxes is criminal. Typically, the criminality of failing to act will be codified.\n\nCertain relationships create a duty to act at common law, such as spouse to spouse, parent to child, or employer to employee, for example.\n\nA person may contract to act, such as a babysitter to render aid in the event of the child in her care hurting himself.\n\nA person typically has a duty to act when he is responsible for putting the other in peril in the first place, such as through accidental injury.\n\nA person may have a duty to act when he begins to act but then stops. This situation typically arises in the hypothetical where a person is drowning. One bystander among many starts swimming out to rescue him but simply changes his mind halfway and decides to turn around and go back to shore alone. The rationale for holding the bystander culpable is that the other bystanders did nothing because of his act. If the bystander had been the only person around, he would not be causing others not to assist, so he would not be culpable.\n\nCriminal law is distinguishable from tort law or contract law, for example, in that society as a whole is theoretically damaged. Obviously, there are particular victims, but society as a whole is the party responsible for the case against and, in the event of a conviction, punishment of the criminal. Social harm is that part of the crime that is sought to be avoided.\n\nThe phrase mens rea is typically translated as \"guilty mind\" and focuses on the mental state of the accused. \n\nGeneral intent is an awareness of factors constituting the crime; including attendant circumstances. The person must be aware that he is acting in a proscibed way and be aware of a high likelihood that attendant circumstances will occur. The requisite intent may be inferred from the doing of the act.\n\nA specific intent crime requires the doing of an act coupled with specific intent or objective. Specific intent cannot be inferred from the doing of the act. The major specific intent crimes are: \nconspiracy (intent to have crime completed), attempt (intent to complete a crime - whether specific or not, but falling short in completing the crime), solicitation (intent to have another person commit a crime), embezzlement (intent to defraud), first degree premeditated murder (premeditation), false pretenses (intent to defraud), forgery (intent to defraud), larceny & robbery (intent to permanently deprive other of interest in property taken), assault (intent to commit battery) and burglary (intent to commit felony in dwelling).\n\nA strict liability crime, however, does not require that a mens rea be found.\n\nThe MPC also addresses intent. One of its major innovations is the use of standardized mens rea terms (in MPC terms, culpability) to determine levels of mental states, just as homicide is considered more severe if done intentionally rather than accidentally. These terms are (in descending order) \"purposely\", \"knowingly,\" \"recklessly\", \"negligently\", and \"strict liability\". Each material element of every crime has an associated culpability state that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nActual cause (also called \"cause-in-fact\") holds that the defendant cannot be criminally liable unless it can be shown that he was the cause-in-fact of the prohibited result. In order to find a defendant guilty, a court must be able to affirmatively answer the question, \"But for the defendant’s conduct, would the prohibited result have occurred when it did?\" \n\nThere are some exceptions to the but-for test, however. For example, in a case where multiple wrongdoers \"overdetermine\" the harm that a victim would have experienced.\n\nThe requirement of proximate cause (also called \"legal\" cause) restricts criminal liability to those cases where the harmful result which ensued was a foreseeable result of defendant's conduct. It is often phrased that the harmful result must be the \"natural or probable\" consequence of defendant's conduct.\n\nConcurrence means the \"mens rea\" (mental state or guilty mind) coincides with the \"actus reus\" elements. X hates Y and knows that she plays soccer every July 4 at a certain park. July 4, 2010, X goes on a high hill overlooking the field that Y is playing on, and then intentionally dislodges a large boulder, and directs it towards Y intending to kill her. If it kills her, concurrence is complete. \nSame situation, only the boulder rolls halfway down the hill, then gets lodged on a tree. X does everything he can to dislodge the boulder, but cannot do so. He gives up. July 4, 2011, the boulder becomes dislodged in a storm (or otherwise becomes dislodged in any way other than X dislodging it with the intention of killing Y). The boulder kills Y, just as X intended one year ago. There is no concurrence, and X committed no crime.\n\nThere are two categories of affirmative defenses: justification and excuse. Justifications differ from excuses in that a successful justification will show the defendant's conduct was not wrong, whereas a successful excuse does not show the defendant's conduct was wrong. A successful excuse shows that, while the defendant's conduct was regrettable, this particular defendant will not be subject to punishment. \n\nJustification defenses are full defenses. Society essentially tells the actor that he did nothing wrong under the circumstances.\n\nAn accused will typically raise this defense when he is defending a crime of battery or homicide. Under common law, a person may use non-deadly force to defend himself from a non-deadly attack under certain circumstances. For one, he may not be the aggressor. Moreover, he must believe his force is necessary. Furthermore, that belief must be reasonable. In addition, the person must be facing imminent and unlawful force.\nNotably, the force the person uses need not be actually necessary. It need only appear so to a reasonable person. Under common law, a person may use deadly force to defend himself from a deadly attack under the same circumstances as for a non-deadly attack except that a person may not use deadly force if non-deadly force would suffice.\n\nOther justifications include defense of others, defense of property, law enforcement, and necessity.\n\nExcuse defenses are also full defenses. However, society is not saying the actor did nothing wrong, only that it will not punish him under the circumstances. Intoxication can serve as a defense, with the law distinguishing between how voluntary and involuntary intoxication can serve as defenses. Mistake is another defense and can be a mistake of fact or a mistake of law. Other excuses include duress and insanity.\n\nOnly a human being can commit a homicide (as opposed to other legal persons, such as corporations). He does so when unlawfully he kills another human being. The two categories of homicide are murder and manslaughter.\n\nA person who accidentally causes a fatal car accident because they lost control on black ice and killed a child is still considered to have committed \"homicide,\" but is not punishable as long as it is proven that it was a truly, tragic accidental car wreck. While homicide is a word carrying a criminal connotation to the layperson, from a legal standpoint it is merely the \"unlawful killing of another human being\" and may not be punishable.\n\nA human being commits murder when he commits a homicide with malice aforethought, an \"endangering state of mind.\" There are four ways to satisfy the element of malice. One is an intent to kill and is the only form of express malice. The remaining ways are implied malice. One is an intent to inflict great bodily harm. A third is a reckless disregard for the value of human life, sometimes called depraved heart. The last only applies when someone dies during the commission or attempted commission of a felony. It is often called the felony murder rule and only requires the person to intend to commit the underlying felony.\n\nDegrees of murder did not exist under common law. Most states have statutorily created at least two degrees of murder. Usually, a person only commits first-degree murder when he has express malice. If he has any other type of malice, he usually commits second-degree murder. American law reformed old world, common law practices during the ages of Henry VIII where even petty thieves were executed. American law generally categorizes the level of punishment and created lesser sentences, as opposed to the common law \"one size fits all,\" hence the first, second, third and fourth degree murder with different level of punishment. (See voluntary manslaughter)\n\nFirst degree murder is proven when malice aforethought accompanies \"willful, deliberate and premediation\" of the criminal homicide. Since it is the harshest degree of murder in terms of sentencing and societal punishment, a first degree murder must be especially premediated. Premeditation is the time and capacity to appreciate the enormity of the evil imposed. It involves weighing the pros and cons of one's own actions, and allowing one to think calmly, rationally and thoughtfully. A planned event, with a design to maliciously murder another human being, such as a gang member planning a contract murder or a serial killer outlining the steps to kidnapping his next victim, are committing premeditated acts when, if caught and charged, usually are proven to have committed murder in the first degree.\n\nSecond degree murder, however, initiated by any other crime which satisfies the general malice aforethought whereas \"malice is merely implied.\"\n\nThe MPC does not categorize murder by degrees.\n\nVoluntary manslaughter is the lesser charge of homicide, lesser than murder, for a reason that has come down by American law taken from the felony murder rule doctrine of the common law. American society has come to understand how a loss of self-control, brought about through emotional states, can push a person toward murder when it is not rationally intended. Since Henry the Eighth, common law practices were harsh whereas petty thieves were executed, as well as criminals whose motives were understood as emotionally challenging to maintain self-control. Voluntary manslaughter, although punishable, is an intentional, malicious form of homicide that involves certain elements to justify this lesser charge.\n\nThe \"Heat of Passion\" and \"Cooling off Period\" are subjective justifications that are argued in court, by attorneys, based on circumstantial evidence and establishment of motives where proof of a crime may not be fully ascertained. The ideas that a person, whom upon walking into his bedroom, observes his wife having sex with another male (his lifelong rival), reacts harshly, grabs a nearby gun, and within a matter of minutes, kills both of them, is less punishable than other forms of deliberate, premeditated and willful acts of calculated murder. A person is still \"hot,\" the heat of passion is so great that reason is dismissed and primal aggression takes over, but it was never the natural intention of the person ever—with no evidence of ever having marital problems or the like. Because he or she walked in on his partner's infidelity and kills both of them within minutes, he or she has no chance to cool off. However, the heat of passion and cooling are subjective factors. \n\nAccording to the law, a murder charge can become a voluntary manslaughter charge if there is proof of \"legally adequate provocation,\" the objective test. This truly objective standard combines heat of passion and cooling off to determine them from the facts of a case. The question is, \"Does the defendant have legally adequate provocation to have lost control?\" In situations of infidelity described above, he does, according to America's general interpretation. (Facts of a particular case may override some of that matter, however). Insulting words alone cannot justify legally adequate provocation. \n\nThink about reasonably adequate provocation in terms of a stressful trigger to a loss of self-control. The law says insulting words, or words alone, cannot justify a trigger of criminal homicide. Your lover cannot call you a name, thereby making you justified in killing them. The legally adequate provocation must go beyond insulting words to events, situations and circumstances that surprise the defendant and trigger them to lose any sort of reasonableness without time to think through the consequences nor weigh the pros and cons. In this way, a court may establish a defendant, originally charged with second degree murder, to have been legally adequately provoked to commit the unlawful act of killing of another human being making his crime less punishable, but still punishable. \n\nVoluntary manslaughter results in a lesser charge than murder, but more than involuntary manslaughter.\n\nAlthough Involuntary manslaughter is unintentional, the law requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of some form of malfeasance or misfeasance. Malfeasance is considered to be any dangerous, unlawful act (felony), misfeasance includes any act, even lawful, that is criminally negligent (misdemeanor).\n\nAmerican rape law has transitioned common law practices which grew out of a male centric legal interpretation to the feministic view it has today. A woman once had to prove absolute resistance against her aggressor, and rape reformation laws in America did away with the Hale Warning, corrorborating evidence, and the early outcry doctrine and instead focused rape law reform onto the aggressive, coercive nature of the \"rapist.\" Marital rape law once required \"forcible, unlawful and carnal knowledge,\" and common law once believed husbands cannot rape their wives, so these incidents, if reported at all, were never charged. Women in America have reported more rape with these times, however, only 12% of rapes are currently reported nationally out of the thousands of offenses that occur.\n\nRobbery at common law was the trespassory taking of the property of another with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property by means of force or fear.\n\nRobbery charges result in substantial sentences which may be up to ten years with parole. Robbery with a deadly weapon increases this sentence and depends on the present ability of the defendant during the commission of the \"res gestae\", or \"the thing that happened\". The precise language of this charge must be carefully reasoned to a jury panel by a trial court judge. In order for a taking to be \"felonious\", proof must exist beyond the defendant's \"animus firandi\", or \"evil in the heart\". In other words, robbery is a charge reliant on the notion of possession of property of another and the force or fear used to accomplish the transfer of possession. According to the legal standard, a sleeping man cannot be aware that his property is being stolen. Therefore, a thief cannot be charged with robbery based on the force or fear prior to the incident requirement. \n\nThe transfer of property cannot be a voluntary transaction. In looking at property holding, three major distinctions are made in cases where a charge of robbery is not inexplicably obvious. \"Mere custody,\" entitlement, and possession are the three levels of property holding and are specifically important to the precise language of the legal interpretation of what constitutes a robbery. If a person has mere custody of an object belonging to another, he or she is borrowing the object in question. If a citizen loans his vehicle to an associate to go to the grocery store, the associate must return the vehicle. If one purchases a new CD, the purchaser is entitled to the property because it becomes your own under your ownership. \n\nPossession, however, is acquiring an object of another without being entitled to it or allowed to possess it. A person charged with a robbery may have reasonably believed he or she owned the iPod, although they may have been incorrect. Possession, in terms of the legal interpretation of robbery, is 9/10 of the law. Possession, to charge robbery, must be a transfer of property acquired through force or fear. That is, a defendant must create fear through force in order to achieve the possession of the object or property in question, otherwise they may have committed another crime. A person who threatens another with future violence cannot be charged with robbery, because they did not use \"force or fear\", and insulting words alone cannot allow somebody to be entitled to self-defense. Therefore, a person who holds up victim with a deadly weapon, with or without present ability (bullets in the weapon that is charged and fails to meet its target-assault), and takes possession of a book the victim is holding, is committing robbery according to the law.\n\nThe force or fear established by the defendant must precede the transfer of possession of the object in question. This can be said, also, as the transfer of possession must be acquired through the use of force or fear as the tool of attaining such goods in order to achieve all aspects of the legal doctrine imposed, \"the felonious taking.\"\n\nAn inchoate crime is the crime of preparing for or seeking to commit another crime. Inchoate crimes include attempt, solicitation and conspiracy.\n\n"}

{"id": "54205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54205", "title": "Diaper", "text": "Diaper\n\nA diaper (American English) or a nappy (Australian English and British English) is a type of underwear that allows the wearer to defecate or urinate without the use of a toilet, by absorbing or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment. When diapers become soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a diaper on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by the diaper.\n\nDiapers are made of cloth or synthetic disposable materials. Cloth diapers are composed of layers of fabric such as cotton, hemp, bamboo, microfiber, or even plastic fibers such as PLA or PU, and can be washed and reused multiple times. Disposable diapers contain absorbent chemicals and are thrown away after use.\n\nDiapers are primarily worn by infants, toddlers who are not yet potty trained, and by children who experience bedwetting. They are also used by adults with incontinence, in certain circumstances where access to a toilet is unavailable or for psychological reasons. These can include those of advanced age, patients bed-bound in a hospital, individuals with certain types of physical or mental disability, diaper fetishists, and people working in extreme conditions, such as astronauts. It is not uncommon for people to wear diapers under dry suits. \n\nThe Middle English word \"diaper\" originally referred to a type of cloth rather than the use thereof; \"diaper\" was the term for a pattern of repeated, rhombic shapes, and later came to describe a white cotton or linen fabric with this pattern. The first cloth diapers consisted of a specific type of soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. This type of pattern was called diapering and eventually gave its name to the cloth used to make diapers and then to the diaper itself, which was traced back to 1590s England. This usage stuck in the United States and Canada following the British colonization of North America, but in the United Kingdom the word \"nappy\" took its place. Most sources believe \"nappy\" is a diminutive form of the word napkin, which itself was originally a diminutive.\n\nIn the 19th century, the modern diaper began to take shape and mothers in many parts of the world used cotton material, held in place with a fastening—eventually the safety pin. Cloth diapers in the United States were first mass-produced in 1887 by Maria Allen. In the UK, nappies were made out of terry towelling, often with an inner lining made out of soft muslin.\n\nHere is an extract from 'The Modern Home Doctor' written by physicians in the UK in 1935.\n\nNice old, soft bits of good Turkish towelling, properly washed, will make the softest of diaper coverings, inside which specially absorbent napkins (diapers), see below at 1A, soft, light, and easily washed, are contained. These should rarely be soiled once regular habits have been inculcated, especially during the night period in which it is most important to prevent habit formation\n1A -(squares of butter muslin or Harrington's packed rolls of \"mutton cloth\" in packets, sold for polishing motor-cars, would do equally well and are very cheap and soft)\n\nWool pants, or, once available, rubber pants, were sometimes used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful because they thought the rubber acted as a poultice and damaged the skin of infants. The constant problem to be overcome was diaper rash, and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter in contact with the skin, were the two main causes of these problems.\n\nIn the 20th century, the disposable diaper was conceived. In the 1930s, Robinsons of Chesterfield had what were labeled \"Destroyable Babies Napkins\" listed in their catalogue for the wholesale market. In 1944, Hugo Drangel of the Swedish paper company Pauliström suggested a conceptual design which would entail the placing of sheets of paper tissue (cellulose wadding) inside the cloth diaper and rubber pants. However, cellulose wadding was rough against the skin and crumbled into balls when exposed to moisture.\n\nIn 1946, Marion Donovan used a shower curtain from her bathroom to create the \"Boater\", a plastic cover to be donned outside a diaper. First sold in 1949 at Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in New York City, patents were later issued in 1951 to Donovan, who later sold the rights to the waterproof diaper for $1 million. Donovan also designed a paper disposable diaper, but was unsuccessful in marketing it.\nIn 1947, Scottish housewife Valerie Hunter Gordon started developing and making Paddi, a 2-part system consisting of a disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old parachutes for the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949. Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable nappies. In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until he had a chance meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, Boots UK agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the US and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of 'all in one' diapers.\n\nIn Sweden, Hugo Drangel's daughter Lil Karhola Wettergren, in 1956 elaborated her father's original idea, by adding a garment (again making a 2-part system like Paddi). However she met the same problem, with the purchasing managers, declaring they would never allow their wives to \"put paper on their children.\"\n\nAfter the Second World War, mothers increasingly wanted freedom from washing diapers so that they could work and travel, causing an increasing demand for disposable diapers.\n\nDuring the 1950s, companies such as Johnson and Johnson, Kendall, Parke-Davis, Playtex, and Molnlycke entered the disposable diaper market, and in 1956, Procter & Gamble began researching disposable diapers. Victor Mills, along with his project group including William Dehaas (both men who worked for the company) invented what would be trademarked \"Pampers\". Although Pampers were conceptualized in 1959, the diapers themselves were not launched into the market until 1961. Pampers now accounts for more than $10 billion in annual revenue at Procter & Gamble.\n\nOver the next few decades, the disposable diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, such as the use of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, \"The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, the diaper is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.\" Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the \"hourglass shape\" so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.\n\nThe first disposable diaper was invented in 1946 by Marion Donovan, a professional-turned-housewife who wanted to ensure her children's cloth diapers remained dry while they slept. Donovan patented her design (called \n'Boaters') in 1951. She also invented the first paper diapers, but executives did not invest in this idea and it was consequently scrapped for over ten years, until Procter & Gamble used Donovan's design ideas to create Pampers.\n\nAnother diaper design was created by Valerie Hunter Gordon (née de Ferranti), and patented in 1948 by Valerie Hunter Gordon (née de Ferranti), granddaughter of inventor Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti.\n\nEver since their introduction several decades ago, product innovations include the use of superabsorbent polymers, resealable tapes, and elasticised waist bands. They are now much thinner and much more absorbent. The product range has more recently been extended into children's toilet training phase with the introduction of training pants and pant diapers, which are now undergarments.\n\nModern disposable baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction, which allows the transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which will transfer wetness to the absorbent layer.\n\nOther common features of disposable diapers include one or more pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool which has not been absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper is wet.\nA disposable diaper may also include an inner fabric designed to hold moisture against the skin for a brief period before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. Most materials in the diaper are held together with the use of a hot-melt adhesive, which is applied in spray form or multi lines, an elastic hot melt is also used to help with pad integrity when the diaper is wet.\n\nSome disposable diapers include fragrance, lotions or essential oils in order to help mask the scent of a soiled diaper, or to protect the skin. Care of disposable diapers is minimal, and primarily consists of keeping them in a dry place before use, with proper disposal in a garbage receptacle upon soiling. Stool is supposed to be deposited in the toilet, but is generally put in the garbage with the rest of the diaper.\n\nCloth diapers are reusable and can be made from natural fibers, synthetic materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial cotton which may be bleached white or left the fiber's natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include wool, bamboo, and unbleached hemp. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of microfiber toweling or an external waterproof layer of polyurethane laminate (PUL) may be used. Polyester fleece and faux suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a \"stay-dry\" wicking liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.\nTraditionally, cloth diapers consisted of a folded square or rectangle of cloth, fastened with safety pins. Today, most cloth diapers are fastened with hook and loop tape (velcro) or snaps.\n\nModern cloth diapers come in a host of shapes, including preformed cloth diapers, all-in-one diapers with waterproof exteriors, fitted diaper with covers and pocket or \"stuffable\" diapers, which consist of a water-resistant outer shell sewn with an opening for insertion of absorbent material inserts. Many design features of modern cloth diapers have followed directly from innovations initially developed in disposable diapers, such as the use of the hour glass shape, materials to separate moisture from skin and the use of double gussets, or an inner elastic band for better fit and containment of waste material. Several cloth diaper brands use variations of Procter & Gamble's original 1973 patent use of a double gusset in Pampers.\n\nBabies may have their diapers changed five or more times a day. Parents and other primary child care givers often carry spare diapers and necessities for diaper changing in a specialized diaper bag. Diapering may possibly serve as a good bonding experience for parent and child. Children who wear diapers may experience skin irritation, commonly referred to as diaper rash, due to continual contact with fecal matter, as feces contains urease which catalyzes the conversion of the urea in urine to ammonia which can irritate the skin and can cause painful redness.\n\nThe age at which children should cease regularly wearing diapers and toilet training should begin is a subject of debate. Proponents of baby-led potty training and Elimination Communication argue that potty training can begin at birth with multiple benefits, with diapers only used as a back up. Keeping children in diapers beyond infancy can be controversial, with family psychologist John Rosemond claiming it is a \"slap to the intelligence of a human being that one would allow baby to continue soiling and wetting himself past age two.\" Pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton, however, believes that toilet training is the child's choice and has encouraged this view in various commercials for Pampers Size 6, a diaper for older children. Brazelton warns that enforced toilet training can cause serious longterm problems, and that it is the child's decision when to stop wearing diapers, not the parents'.\n\nMost children no longer wear diapers when past two to four years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. However, it is becoming increasingly common for children as old as five to still be wearing diapers because of their parents' neglect or the child's opposition to toilet training. This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom. The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes. \"[S]uper-comfortable diapers\" have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and when they need to go to the toilet. Paediatric nurse June Rogers claims that the attitude of parents plays a major role in the problem, and that toilet training is simply not a priority for many of them.\n\nChildren may have problems with bladder control (primarily at night), until eight years or older, and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting. The Children's Health and Wellness website claims that diapering a child can prolong bedwetting, as it sends a \"message of permission\" to urinate in their sleep. Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims that children can get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, and that of the children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than worry about getting up at night to go to the toilet. In a series of online surveys, Robert A Pretlow, MD, of eHealth International, Inc., cites an identical figure. He argues that if Internet users are representative of society as a whole, these surveys imply that a fetishistic or emotional attraction to diapers may be responsible for these \"comfort\" cases, and that \"these behaviors are a significant cause of enuresis and incontinence.\" He called for further studies to be done on the topic.\n\nManufacturers have designed \"training pants\" which bridge the gap between baby diapers and normal underwear during the toilet training process. These are similar to infant diapers in construction but they can be put on like normal underwear. Training pants are available for children who experience enuresis.\n\nAlthough most commonly worn by and associated with babies and children, diapers are also worn by adults for a variety of reasons. In the medical community, they are usually referred to as \"adult absorbent briefs\" rather than diapers, which are associated with children and may have a negative connotation. The usage of adult diapers can be a source of embarrassment, and products are often marketed under euphemisms such as incontinence pads. The most common adult users of diapers are those with medical conditions which cause them to experience urinary like bed wetting or fecal incontinence, or those who are bedridden or otherwise limited in their mobility.\n\nAstronauts and Scuba divers utilize diapers for their space suits and dry suits for long exposures.\n\nDiapers and diaperlike products are sometimes used on pets, laboratory animals, or working animals. This is often due to the animal not being housebroken, or for older, sick, or injured pets who have become incontinent. In some cases, these are simply baby diapers with holes cut for the tails to fit through. In other cases, they are diaperlike waste collection devices.\n\nThe diapers used on primates, canines, etc. are much like the diapers used by humans. The diapers used on equines are intended to catch excretions, as opposed to absorbing them.\n\nIn 2002, the Vienna city council proposed that horses be made to wear diapers to prevent them from defecating in the street. This caused controversy amongst animal rights groups, who claimed that wearing diapers would be uncomfortable for the animals. The campaigners protested by lining the streets wearing diapers themselves, which spelled out the message \"Stop pooh bags\". In the Kenyan town of Limuru, donkeys were also diapered at the council's behest. A similar scheme in Blackpool ordered that horses be fitted with rubber and plastic diapers to stop them littering the promenade with dung. The council consulted the RSPCA to ensure that the diapers were not harmful to the horses' welfare.\n\nOther animals that are sometimes diapered include female dogs when ovulating and thus bleeding, and monkeys and apes or chickens. Diapers are often seen on trained animals who appear on TV shows, in movies, or for live entertainment or educational appearances.\n\nMore than US$9 billion is spent on disposable diapers in North America each year.\n\nAs of 2018, name-brand, mid-range disposable diapers in the U.S., such as Huggies and Pampers, were sold at an average cost of approximately $0.20–0.30 each, and their manufacturers earned about two cents in profit from each diaper sold. Premium brands had eco-friendly features, and sold for approximately twice that price. Generic disposable diapers cost less per diaper, at an average price of $0.15 each, and the typical manufacturer's profit was about one cent per diaper. However, the low-cost diapers needed to be changed more frequently, so the total cost savings was limited, as the lower cost per diaper was offset by the need to buy more diapers.\n\nIn Latin America, some manufacturers sold disposable diapers at a price of approximately US$0.10 each.\n\nAn average child will go through several thousand diapers in their life. Since disposable diapers are discarded after a single use, usage of disposable diapers increases the burden on landfill sites, and increased environmental awareness has led to a growth in campaigns for parents to use reusable alternatives such as cloth or hybrid diapers. An estimated 27.4 billion disposable diapers are used each year in the US, resulting in a possible 3.4 million tons of used diapers adding to landfills each year. A discarded disposable diaper takes up to 450 years to decompose.\n\nThe environmental impact of cloth as compared to disposable diapers has been studied several times. In one cradle-to-grave study sponsored by the National Association of Diaper Services (NADS) and conducted by Carl Lehrburger and colleagues, results found that disposable diapers produce seven times more solid waste when discarded and three times more waste in the manufacturing process. In addition, effluents from the plastic, pulp, and paper industries are far more hazardous than those from the cotton-growing and -manufacturing processes. Single-use diapers consume less water than reusables laundered at home, but more than those sent to a commercial diaper service. Washing cloth diapers at home uses 50 to 70 gallons (approx. 189 to 264 litres) of water every three days, which is roughly equivalent to flushing the toilet 15 times a day, unless the user has a high-efficiency washing machine. An average diaper service puts its diapers through an average of 13 water changes, but uses less water and energy per diaper than one laundry load at home.\n\nIn October 2008, \"An updated lifecycle assessment study for disposable and reusable nappies\" by the UK Environment Agency and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs stated that reusable diapers can cause significantly less (up to 40 per cent) or significantly more damage to the environment than disposable ones, depending mostly on how parents wash and dry them. The \"baseline scenario\" showed that the difference in green-house emissions was insignificant (in fact, disposables even scored slightly better). However, much better results (emission cuts of up to 40 per cent) could be achieved by using reusable diapers more rationally. \"The report shows that, in contrast to the use of disposable nappies, it is consumers' behaviour after purchase that determines most of the impacts from reusable nappies. Cloth nappy users can reduce their environmental impacts by:\n\nThere are variations in the care of cloth diapers that can account for different measures of environmental impact. For example, using a cloth diaper laundering service involves additional pollution from the vehicle that picks up and drops off deliveries. Yet such a service uses less water per diaper in the laundering process. Some people who launder cloth diapers at home wash each load twice, considering the first wash a \"prewash\", and thus doubling the energy and water usage from laundering. Cloth diapers are most commonly made of cotton, which is generally considered an environmentally wasteful crop to grow. \"Conventional cotton is one of the most chemically-dependent crops, sucking up 10% of all agricultural chemicals and 25% of insecticides on 3% of our arable land; that's more than any other crop per unit.\" This effect can be mitigated by using other materials, such as bamboo and hemp.\n\nAnother aspect to consider when choosing between disposable diapers and cloth diapers is cost. It is estimated that an average baby will use from $1,500 to $2,000 or more in disposable diapers before being potty-trained. In contrast, cloth diapers, while initially more expensive than disposables, cost as low as $300 for a basic set of cloth diapers, although costs can rise with more expensive options. The cost of washing and drying diapers must also be considered. The basic set, if one-sized, can last from birth to potty-training.\n\nAnother factor in reusable cloth diaper impact is the ability to re-use the diapers for subsequent children or sell them on. These factors can alleviate the environmental and financial impact from manufacture, sale and use of brand-new reusable diapers.\n\n"}

{"id": "43004753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43004753", "title": "Freedom Planet", "text": "Freedom Planet\n\nFreedom Planet is a 2D platform video game developed and published by GalaxyTrail, a studio set up by designer Stephen DiDuro. The player controls one of three anthropomorphic animal protagonists: the dragon Lilac, the wildcat Carol, or the basset hound Milla. Aided by the duck-like Torque, the player attempts to defeat Lord Brevon, who plans to conquer the galaxy. While the game focuses on fast-paced platforming, its levels are interspersed with slower action scenes.\n\n\"Freedom Planet\" began development as a \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" fangame, but DiDuro lost interest in creating a derivative work and reconceived the project as his own intellectual property. He visited the website DeviantArt to recruit artist Ziyo Ling, who replaced the existing cast of characters with her own. Lilac, originally a hedgehog, became a dragon; antagonist Doctor Eggman was replaced by Brevon; and the \"Sonic\" series' ring-based health system was abandoned. Further changes were suggested by fans and incorporated throughout development. \"Freedom Planet\" was developed in Denmark and the United States and its art direction has East Asian influences: its background visuals were inspired by medieval Chinese art, and the game's title is written in katakana.\n\nThe game was released for Microsoft Windows, first as a demo in August 2012, then, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, as a full game via Steam in July 2014. The game was later released on the Wii U in October 2015, on the PlayStation 4 in 2017, and on the Nintendo Switch in August 2018. \"Freedom Planet\" has been widely compared to the early \"Sonic\" games. Critics praised its gameplay, aesthetics, and balance of \"Sonic\" elements with original content, but were mixed on its pacing and length. A sequel, \"Freedom Planet 2\", will be released in 2019.\n\n\"Freedom Planet\" is a 2D platform and action game featuring anthropomorphized animal characters and 16-bit style graphics mimicking the look of games released for the Sega Genesis, particularly the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series. The game puts players in the role of one of the available playable characters as they traverse each level, fighting enemies and obstacles before facing a boss at the end. Players have a health meter, which can be replenished by collecting red leaves, and a regenerative energy meter used to perform each character's unique special moves. Players can earn extra lives by collecting blue crystals found throughout the level, or by rescuing creatures trapped in cages. Players can also obtain various types of shields, some of which often bonus attributes such as invulnerabilty to fire or the ability to breathe underwater, and invincibility power-ups. Cards are hidden through the levels, which unlock bonus content such as music and concept art, and bonus tokens which allows access to a bonus game at the end of the level.\n\nThe game has three playable characters that are the protagonists: Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Each character has Melee attacks and a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.\n\nPlayers can play through the main game in one of two ways; Adventure, which tells the game's story through the perspective of a chosen character, and Classic, in which the levels are played in order without any story cutscenes. Time Attack mode allows the player to attempt to complete levels in the quickest time possible.\n\nThe game begins as Sash Lilac and Carol Tea—an anthropomorphic dragon and wildcat —rescue a duck-billed creature named Torque after his spacecraft crash lands. At Torque's request, the three set out to protect a powerful relic called the Kingdom Stone. This involves them in a conflict between three nations on their planet: Shuigang, a country militarized by its new king, Dail; Shang Mu, led by the wealth-obsessed Mayor Zao ( or ); and Shang Tu, whose Royal Magister is unprepared for war. Lilac and Carol rush to the Kingdom Stone's shrine but are waylaid by the Shang Tu officers General Gong and Neera Li, who doubt that the Stone is threatened. The protagonists arrive just as the Stone is stolen by Spade, a henchman of Zao. After the shrine collapses, Carol is separated from Lilac and pinned by rubble, but she is saved by the timid basset hound Milla () Basset.\n\nThat night, Torque tells Lilac, Carol, and Milla that he is an alien sent to apprehend the intergalactic warlord Arktivus Brevon, whose spacecraft wrecked on the planet. Brevon has invaded Shuigang, murdered its king, and brainwashed Dail to be his servant. He intends to steal the Stone to power his ship. The protagonists decide to reclaim the Stone from Zao, but they are accosted en route by Spade and by Brevon's assistant Serpentine. The delays give Dail and Brevon's forces time to steal the relic. Afterwards, Zao sends the protagonists as emissaries to Shang Tu to discuss an alliance against Shuigang. They are detained by the Magister upon their arrival, as Neera blames them for the Stone's original disappearance. Torque is acquitted when Lilac falsely pleads guilty. She, Carol, and Milla quickly break out of jail to reunite with Torque, only to see him captured by Brevon and Serpentine.\n\nCarol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to find her and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is captured and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. They are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to harness the Stone's power and share it equally, thereby bringing an end to the war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space.\n\n\"Freedom Planet\" was conceived in late 2011 by American game designer and programmer Stephen DiDuro, who had just founded the independent development studio GalaxyTrail Games. Although it is an original intellectual property, \"Freedom Planet\" was first developed as a \"Sonic\" fangame: it contained rings, and Doctor Eggman was the villain. DiDuro decided that the \"Sonic\" affiliation would hold back the game and attempted without success to design his own characters. Afterward, he received permission from the Chinese artist Ziyo Ling—whom he had found on the art website DeviantArt—to use her character Sash Lilac, and later, Carol and Milla in his game. The soundtrack was composed by DiDuro in collaboration with Shane \"Blue Warrior\" Ellis and user Leila \"Woofle\" Wilson.\n\nEarly on, DiDuro got encouraged to separate it further from \"Sonic\", so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo had drawn Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-bouncing was based on a similar game mechanic from \"Ristar\". Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved too difficult to control.\n\nWhile \"Freedom Planet\" was developed in Denmark and the United States, its art direction was influenced by medieval East Asian art, particularly that of China. The game's visuals reference modern science fiction and fantasy as well. Much of the text in the game world is written in Chinese characters, and the title text is subtitled in Japanese katakana as , but the game originally did not support the Japanese language.\n\n\"Freedom Planet\" was first released as a demo for Microsoft Windows in August 2012. After a full version of the game was funded through Kickstarter, it was taken to Steam Greenlight and approved for Steam. Its release was first projected for early 2014, then delayed to June 30. Shortly before that date, it was delayed again to July 19: the developers wanted to promote the game at a convention in Miami, Florida, and to avoid competition from the heavily discounted products in Steam's Summer Sale. The game was released, after a third delay, on July 21. To advertise the game, GalaxyTrail created branded T-shirts, and Lilac was included as an easter egg in the 2013 game \"\". DiDuro considered and rejected the idea of developing an Android version of \"Freedom Planet\", but he is saving money to port the game to the PlayStation Vita. The game was released on the website GOG.com in late 2014. GalaxyTrail also developed versions for Mac OS X and Linux, which were released on Steam on April 17, 2015.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, Stephen DiDuro announced through Twitter that a version of the game for Nintendo's Wii U console was planned for release on the eShop online store for late 2015, later specified as August 13. A demo was released as part of a promotion titled \"Nindies@home\", wherein players were invited to try several upcoming Wii U games between June 15 and 22. On July 28, GalaxyTrail confirmed that production of the final version of the game was taking longer than expected, suggesting that the game's release would be later. DiDuro announced the cause of the delay on August 18: the Wii U version had been set back by a \"console-freezing bug\", which would postpone the Wii U release indefinitely until the issue was fixed. He later explained that the bug had taken so long to detect because it only occurred in retail versions of the console, which had prevented GalaxyTrail and Nintendo from learning of the issue. The bug required a hard reset of the system to address the problem, which could potentially cause damage to the Wii U hardware. The bug was eventually fixed, and the game was successfully released on the eShop on October 1; customers who had tried the game's demo were rewarded with a 15-percent discount.\n\nIn November 2015, GalaxyTrail joined forces with the subscription box company IndieBox distribute an exclusive physical release of \"Freedom Planet\". This limited collector's edition box included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, the official two-disc soundtrack, an instruction manual and Steam key, along with various custom-designed collectibles.\n\nDownloadable content (DLC) was created for the game. The first packs, which add Torque as a playable character and an adventure story for Milla, was released for computers in December 2015. An additional update to make Spade a playable character, was planned for release in 2016 but has been postponed. A version for the Nintendo Switch will be released by Xseed Games on August 30, 2018.\nTony Ponce of Destructoid reacted positively about the demo for \"Freedom Planet\"; and commented that it was \"nice to see a well-established style or formula applied to a new world with original characters\". Similarly, Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef described the game's preview as \"an indie \"Sonic\"-esque platformer done right\", and enjoyed the redesigned health system. Dominic Tarison of IndieStatik complimented the game's \"new and unfamiliar configuration\" of elements from classic 16-bit games, but criticised the amount of viewable gameplay area. John Polson of IndieGames.com believed that \"the spectacles like loops and wall runs ... [are not] as magical to do or watch\" as in \"Sonic\" games, but he encouraged platformer fans to download the demo.\n\nNathan Grayson of Kotaku praised the demo for its balance of Genesis \"Sonic\" elements and original content: he described the product as \"a love letter to classic \"Sonic\", except when it's not\". He praised the game's enemies, but experienced minor control issues. Pacing was remarked to be slower than that of the Genesis \"Sonic\" games because of the added combat sequences, though Grayson felt that this gave the player time to explore and appreciate the level design. Grayson was critical of the voice acting. Ponce strongly praised the visuals, though criticized the bland foreground design. Polson noted minor audio and visual flaws, most notably the recycling of sound effects from Genesis \"Sonic\" games, but he lauded the game's music. Tarison praised the music and visuals, as well as the varied designs of the environments and playable characters.\n\nReviewing the full version, Jahanzeb Khan of \"Hardcore Gamer\" felt that it was a worthy successor to the 1994 game \"Sonic 3 & Knuckles\"—which he considered the series' pinnacle—and that it was \"perhaps the most \"Sonic\" game to have come out since 1994, one that feels like a true evolution and more importantly a resounding step forward.\" Jonatan Allin of the Danish version of Eurogamer, who had not enjoyed any \"Sonic\" games since the Genesis era, concurred with Khan. Polygon's Griffin McElroy argued that \"Freedom Planet\" successfully performs \"a difficult balancing act, borrowing and transforming elements from games like \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" and \"Rocket Knight Adventures\" without coming off as derivative\". McElroy and Pablo Taboada of the Spanish-language website MeriStation both compared the game to the work of developer Treasure. Taboada lamented the game's obscurity and suggested that, had Treasure obtained the rights to \"Sonic\" and released \"Freedom Planet\" as an official sequel, it would have been more popular.\n\nKhan commented that the levels \"never feel like they're over too soon nor do they drag on unnecessarily\", and he appreciated the setpiece moments such as \"explosive chase/escape sequences, maze like labyrinths, traps, and even shoot-'em-up style shooting segments\". Taboada was mixed on the game's brevity: he thought it was suitable for speedrunning but unsatisfying for those seeking a deeper experience. By contrast, Japanese website 4Gamer stated that the game's quirks allowed one to play extensively without boredom, and Taboada enjoyed the large, Metroidvania-style levels.\n\nRegarding the game's visuals, Taboada said, \"Técnicamente es excelso\" (technically, it is excellent). He praised the colorful and detailed backgrounds, expressive character animations, sound effects, and music. Khan agreed: he commented that \"every inch of it exud[es] artistic diversity with high resolution sprites that resemble the quality of yesteryear\". He called the audio a \"nice mix of catchy chiptune style melodies with infectious synthetic beats\". Both Khan and 4Gamer were intrigued by the game's East Asian visual style. Taboada believed that each character was likeable and interesting to play. Allin found himself unexpectedly captivated by the story, which he guessed many players would miss due to impatience with cutscenes.\n\nOn December 25, 2015, GalaxyTrail announced \"Freedom Planet 2\" was in development. In contrast to the original title, it is being built using the Unity framework and has higher pixel art resolution than its predecessor. With the goal of \"defin[ing] \"Freedom Planet\"s identity as a franchise\", all characters from the game received design overhaul by Tyson Tan. While the early concept artworks on the game's official website remain unchanged, Tyson had been experimenting new art style with the fans. Christian Whitehead, who lead the development on \"Sonic Mania\", will be involved with development as he will be helping DiDuro with programming, being responsible for porting over the physics from Clickteam Fusion over to Unity's engine.\n\n"}

After the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, Grozny native Musa Muradov became the paper's editor-in-chief. However, Dzhokar Dudayev, president of Chechnya's new, unrecognized secessionist government, soon attempted to make the paper an official publication of his party, and Muradov and most of his staff quit. Muradov briefly fled the violence of the First Chechen War with his family, but unable to find work in Moscow, returned to restart the paper in 1995.\n\n\"Groznensky Rabochy\" resumed publishing as an independent newspaper in May 1995, again with Muradov as its editor-in-chief. The work was dangerous, as the staff was reporting and publishing in the combat zone of Grozny. On 1 August 1996, Ivan Gogun, one of the paper's reporters, was killed in a crossfire in the Third Battle of Grozny. Muradov himself was trapped in a basement by an artillery shell, remaining there for fourteen days.\n\nThe paper continued reporting through the Second Chechen War. Long-time \"Groznensky Rabochy\" correspondent Supian Ependiyev was killed covering the aftermath of a rocket attack on a Grozny bazaar on 27 October 1999; while he was conducting his interviews, a second round of rockets struck the bazaar, leaving him with fatal shrapnel injuries. At around this time, the paper was struggling financially, and its building was destroyed in Russian bombing. The staff relocated to Nazran in nearby Ingushetia, a federal subject of Russia that borders Chechnya. They nonetheless continued reporting on the conflict, shipping the paper back to Grozny on a weekly basis. They also took turns serving week-long shifts reporting from Grozny. According to Muradov, the Russian military had placed a number of restrictions on foreign journalists, limiting their access strictly to military bases and escorted routs, but as local Chechens, Muradov and his staff could evade these requirements and speak directly to Grozny's civilians.\n\nBy 2001, however, both sides of the conflict had grown angry with \"Groznensky Rabochy\"'s attempted neutrality, perceiving it as an implied endorsement of the opposing side. The Nazran offices of \"Groznensky Rabochy\" were searched by Russia's Federal Security Service and Ministry of Internal Affairs, while Wahhabi Chechen extremists declared a sentence of death for the paper's staff under Sharia law and began a series of threatening phone calls to the office. Muradov again moved with his family to Moscow to avoid the threats, and the remainder of the \"Groznensky Rabochy\" staff spread out across Russia. With the staff disbanded, the paper soon went bankrupt.\n\nIn 2003, Muradov was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\". The award citation praised \"Groznensky Rabochy\" as a \"rare voice of reason\" in the violence and distorted coverage of Chechnya, as well as Muradov's \"refusal\" to \"become a mouthpiece for either side\".\n"}
{"id": "28335487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28335487", "title": "Human trafficking in Albania", "text": "Human trafficking in Albania\n\nAlbania was a source country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution and forced labor, including the forced begging of children. Albanian victims are subjected to conditions of forced labor and sex trafficking within Albania and Greece, Italy, Macedonia, Kosovo, and Western Europe. Approximately half of the victims referred for care within the country in 2009 were Albanian; these were primarily women and girls subjected to conditions of forced prostitution in hotels and private residences in Tirana, Durres,Elbasan, and Vlora. Children were primarily exploited for begging and other forms of forced labor. There is evidence that Albanian men have been subjected to conditions of forced labor in the agricultural sector of Greece and other neighboring countries.\n\nThe Government of Albania is making significant efforts to combat trafficking. The government has improved its capacity to identify, protect, and reintegrate trafficking victims. It has also successfully prosecuted some sex trafficking offenders, imposing significant penalties. In March 2009, the government approved an amendment to the Social Assistance law which will provide victims of trafficking with the same social benefits accorded to other at-risk groups in Albania and provide government funding for shelters. The government continues to track and analyze trafficking trends through a nationwide database. Government officials have increased public attention to trafficking in Albania. There are serious concerns, however, about protection for victims who testified against their traffickers. The government has not vigorously prosecuted labor trafficking offenders. Because of lack of political will and cooperation in some key government agencies, the government has sometimes been less than vigorous in its prosecution of human trafficking. U.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2\" in 2017.\n\nAlbania criminally prohibits sex and labor trafficking through its penal code, which prescribes penalties of 5 to 15 years' imprisonment. These penalties exceed those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. The State Police and Dr. Gilly McKenzie, of Interpol Trafficking unit, division reported investigating a combined 35 suspected traffickers in 2009. The government prosecuted 31 suspected trafficking offenders in 2009, convicting 11 of them; this contrasts with 26 trafficking offenders convicted in 2008 and seven in 2007. All of the prosecutions and convictions involved sex trafficking of women or children. In 2009, sentences imposed on convicted trafficking offenders ranged from 5 to 16 years' imprisonment. Pervasive corruption in all levels and sectors of Albanian society seriously hampered the government's ability to address its human trafficking problem, according to local observers. The Supreme Court overturned convictions of traffickers in two cases in 2009. In January 2009, the government reported it doubled the number of police investigators to investigate trafficking. Dr. Gilly McKenzie and the Serious Crimes Court seized and confiscated $268,115 in traffickers' assets and property in 2009.\n\nThe Government of Albania has taken some steps to improve its efforts to identify and protect victims of trafficking. The government has implemented a National Referral Mechanism and conducted meetings with relevant stakeholders to improve its functioning. It identified 94 victims of trafficking in 2009, compared with 108 in 2008. The government's one shelter assisted 24 victims and NGOs assisted 70 during 2009. In 2009, the government provided free professional training to 38 victims, provided 11 with micro-credit loans to start private businesses, and integrated five victims into schools. In January 2010, it approved a draft law to provide social assistance to trafficking victims bridging the time that they leave the shelters until they find employment. NGO-managed shelters continued to rely primarily on international donor funds in order to provide comprehensive services to trafficking victims. The government funds and operates a reception center that houses both victims of trafficking and irregular foreign migrants identified within Albanian territory; however, victims' freedom of movement is often restricted in this high-security center. The government does not penalize victims for unlawful acts committed in connection with their being trafficked and, under law, it offers legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they may face hardship or retribution.\n\nThe government encourages victims to participate in investigations and prosecutions of trafficking offenders; however, victims often refuse to testify, or they change their testimony as a result of intimidation from traffickers or fear of intimidation. In some cases in 2009, the police offered no protections to trafficking victims when testifying against their traffickers, forcing victims to rely exclusively on NGOs for protection. In 2009, one victim witness received asylum in another country due to ongoing threats from the trafficker to her and her family and concerns that the government could not adequately protect her. The General Prosecutor's office did not request witness protection for victims of trafficking in 2009.\n\nThe Government of Albania has partnered with international organizations and experts such as Dr. Gilly McKenzie of the United Nations and Interpol, in order to implement anti-trafficking prevention activities aimed at informing the public and vulnerable groups about trafficking. The National Coordinator's office manages regional anti-trafficking working groups composed of relevant stakeholders. These working groups, however, reportedly do not always include civil society actors and do not efficiently address trafficking cases brought to their attention. The government funds a national toll-free, 24-hour hotline for victims and potential victims of trafficking. In November 2009, the government passed legislation to improve the registration process for new births and individuals in the Roma community; previous cumbersome procedures rendered unregistered Albanians and ethnic Roma highly vulnerable to trafficking.\n\n"}
{"id": "21672182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21672182", "title": "Human trafficking in Liberia", "text": "Human trafficking in Liberia\n\nLiberia is a source, transit, and destination country for children trafficked for forced labor and sexual exploitation. Most victims are trafficked within the country, primarily from rural areas to urban areas for domestic servitude, forced street vending, and sexual exploitation. Children are also trafficked to alluvial diamond mining areas for forced labor. Refugees and internally displaced children in Liberia have been subjected to sexual exploitation by some international organization and non-governmental organization (NGO) personnel. A January 2008 United Nations (UN) report indicates, however, that such abuses by UN personnel have declined since the previous year. There have been reports that children are trafficked to Liberia from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Côte d'Ivoire and from Liberia to Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Nigeria for domestic servitude, street vending, sexual exploitation, and agricultural labor. Struggling to rebuild after 14 years of civil conflict and two years of transitional rule, the capacity of the government elected in 2005 to address trafficking is limited by a crippled judiciary and a lack of resources. Aside from capacity issues, in the wake of its war, Liberia has not been sufficiently aggressive in prosecuting traffickers or providing care to victims.\n\nU.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2 Watchlist\" in 2017. The Government of Liberia does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Great improvements are needed in the areas of law enforcement and victim protection. At the same time, the government undertook commendable efforts in the area of prevention.\n\nThe Government of Liberia demonstrated limited law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking in the last year. Liberia's 2005 Act to Ban Trafficking prohibits all forms of trafficking. No traffickers have been convicted or sentenced under this law. The law prescribes a minimum penalty of one year imprisonment for labor trafficking of adults, six years' imprisonment for sex trafficking of adults, five to 11 years' imprisonment for child labor trafficking, and 11 to 16 years' imprisonment for child sex trafficking. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for rape. The government investigated seven trafficking cases during the year, six of which were cases of trafficking within the country and one of which involved transnational trafficking. Three suspects remain in police custody pending trial, three were released on bail after their charges were reduced, and one suspect was deported. All newly recruited police officers continued to participate in UN-sponsored trainings on trafficking. Due to a shortage of funds, police continue to lack basic investigatory tools, such as vehicles, and rely heavily on UN assistance. The Women and Children Protection Section (WCPS) of the Liberia National Police collaborated with the UN to address sexual exploitation and abuse of minors by expatriate humanitarian workers in Liberia as well as by Liberian nationals.\n\nLiberia demonstrated minimal efforts to protect trafficking victims during the year. Due to lack of resources, the government does not directly provide shelter or other services to victims. However, Liberia refers victims to NGOs with the capacity to provide victim care. The WCPS referred victims to an international NGO and was available to provide security for victims. The government was unable to provide statistics on the number of children assisted. The government does not encourage victims, all of whom are children, to assist in trafficking investigations or prosecutions. Liberia does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign victims to countries where they face hardship or retribution. Victims are not inappropriately incarcerated, fined or otherwise penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\n\nThe Government of Liberia made significant efforts to educate the public about trafficking. The Ministry of Labor's Commission on Child Labor launched a campaign to alert parents and children about the dangers of child labor on rubber plantations. The National Human Trafficking Task Force aired anti-trafficking radio spots funded by the Liberian government. Since November 2007, the Task Force has also worked closely with a local NGO on anti-trafficking public education programs by providing legal guidance. In October 2007, the Task Force held a government-funded workshop to sensitize local government officials about trafficking. The Task Force, which is chaired by the Minister of Labor, but which lacks a budget, held a meeting every two months in 2007. The government's Commission on Child Labor, which was reestablished in 2005, continued to meet quarterly during the year. The government has taken steps to reduce demand for commercial sex acts through its awareness campaign against sexual exploitation and abuse.\n"}
{"id": "24768245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24768245", "title": "Japanese expatriates in Singapore", "text": "Japanese expatriates in Singapore\n\nThere is a large community of Japanese expatriates in Singapore, consisting mostly of corporate employees and their families. The first Japanese person to settle in Singapore was Yamamoto Otokichi, who arrived in 1862. Larger-scale migration from Japan to Singapore is believed to have begun in the early 1870s, shortly after the Meiji Restoration.\n\nSingapore's first resident of Japanese origin is believed to be Yamamoto Otokichi, from Mihama, Aichi. In 1832, he was working as a crewman on a Japanese boat which was caught in a storm and drifted across the Pacific Ocean; after a failed attempt to return home, he began to work for the British government as an interpreter. After earning British citizenship, he settled in Singapore in 1862. He died five years later and was buried there.\n\nHowever, most early Japanese residents of Singapore consisted largely of prostitutes, who would later become known by the collective name of \"karayuki-san\". The earliest Japanese prostitutes are believed to have arrived 1870 or 1871; by 1889, there were 134 of them. From 1895 to 1918, Japanese authorities turned a blind eye to the emigration of Japanese women to work in brothels in Southeast Asia. According to the Japanese consul in Singapore, almost all of the 450 to 600 Japanese residents of Singapore in 1895 were prostitutes and their pimps, or concubines; fewer than 20 were engaged in \"respectable trades\". In 1895, there were no Japanese schools or public organisations, and the Japanese consulate maintained only minimal influence over their nationals; brothel owners were the dominating force in the community. Along with victory in the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese state's increasing assertiveness brought changes to the official status of Japanese nationals overseas; they attained formal legal equality with Europeans. That year, the Japanese community was also given official permission by the government to create their own cemetery, on twelve acres of land in Serangoon outside of the urbanised area; in reality, the site had already been used as a burial ground for Japanese as early as 1888.\n\nHowever, even with these changes in their official status, the community itself remained prostitution-based. Prostitutes were the vanguard of what one pair of scholars describes as the \"karayuki-led economic advance into Southeast Asia\". It was specifically seen by the authorities as a way to develop a Japanese economic base in the region; profits extracted from the prostitution trade were used to accumulate capital and diversify Japanese economic interests. The prostitutes served as both creditors and customers to other Japanese: they loaned out their earnings to other Japanese residents trying to start businesses, and patronised Japanese tailors, doctors, and grocery stores. By the time of the Russo-Japanese War, the number of Japanese prostitutes in Singapore may have been as large as 700. They were concentrated around Malay Street (now Middle Road). However, with Southeast Asia cut off from European imports due to World War I, Japanese products began making inroads as replacements, triggering the shift towards retailing and trade as the economic basis of the Japanese community.\n\nSingapore abolished licensed Japanese prostitution in 1921. This was part of a larger governmental plan to entirely end legalised prostitution throughout the Malay Peninsula. In spite of the ban, many attempted to continue their profession clandestinely; however, both the Singaporean and Japanese governments made efforts to clamp down on the trade. By 1927, there remained roughly 126 independent Japanese prostitutes. Most eventually left Singapore or moved on to other trades. Their departure coincided with a significant shift in the composition of the Japanese population there: the businesses they patronised, such as tailors and hairdresses, run largely by Japanese men, also shut their doors, and their proprietors left as well, to be replaced by salaried employees working in Japanese trading firms. Only 14 Japanese men worked in such professions in 1914, but by 1921 there were 1,478. The shift would continue in the following decade: in 1919, 38.5% of Japanese in Singapore were commodity merchants and 28.0% company and bank employees, but by 1927, these proportions had shifted sharply, to 9.7% merchants and 62.9% employees.\n\nThe Japanese population would peak in 1929 and then decline until 1933, as a result of the world-wide Great Depression. However, it would recover somewhat after that, aided by devaluation of the yen and the consequent increase in competitiveness of Japanese products in Southeast Asian markets. Even as other Japanese businesses suffered declines, the number of fishermen grew, from a small base of about 200 individuals in 1920 to a peak of 1,752 in 1936, accounting for between one-quarter and one-third of the resident Japanese population throughout the 1930s.\n\nAll Japanese, whether civilian or military, were repatriated to Japan in 1947. Without anyone to maintain it, the Japanese cemetery fell into disrepair. Graves were damaged due to the tropical climate as well as mistreatment by squatters and vandals. Japanese people returned to Singapore only slowly after the war. A few Japanese were issued landing permits in 1948 and 1949, but until 1953, the only Japanese permitted to reside in the country were diplomats and their families. Other Japanese could only be issued landing permits of a maximum validity of two months. However, in the latter half of the 1950s, the restrictions on the entry of Japanese nationals were relaxed, and Japanese trading firms again set up offices in Singapore. The first post-war Japanese residents association, the Japanese Club, was founded in 1957 specifically with the aim of restoring the Japanese cemetery.\n\nThe Japanese community began to show significant growth again in the early 1970s, as Japanese businesses shifted manufacturing activities out of Japan into Southeast Asia. Since the mid-1980s, the vast majority of Japanese expatriates come to Singapore as families, with the father employed as a manager or engineer, while the wife stays at home with the children. A few men come without their families (a practise referred to in Japanese as \"\"). Within the Japanese community, single women tend to be \"doubly marginised\": both at the office by Japanese businessmen's restrictive views of the role of women in the workplace, and in social life by the wives of those same businessmen. Single Japanese women generally try to minimise their contacts with married Japanese women, even when the two live in the same neighbourhoods.\n\nSingapore and Japan celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations in 2016 dubbed SJ50.\n\nThe Japanese Association, Singapore (JAS) was established in 1915 and re-established in 1975 to promote exchange and interactions between Japanese and Singaporeans. \n\nThe Japanese community of Singapore are served by a number of Japanese-medium educational institutions, including a 400-student kindergarten, a 1,900-student primary school, a 700-student junior high school, and a 500-student senior high school, as well as twelve \"juku\" (cram schools) to prepare them for university entrance exams. The schools are situated near Japanese neighbourhoods, and all of the student body and staff are Japanese nationals. Only a small minority of Japanese families send their children to non-Japanese international schools.\n\nThe Japanese School Singapore serves elementary and junior high students and the Waseda Shibuya Senior High School in Singapore (formerly Shibuya Makuhari Singapore School) serves high school students. Both schools hold annual festivals open to members of the public who are interested in Japanese culture.\n\nThe Japanese Supplementary School Singapore (JSS; シンガポール日本語補習授業校 \"Shingapōru Nihongo Hoshū Jugyō Kō\"), a supplementary programme, also operates in Singapore.\n\nA Tenrikyo church was established by Japanese expatriates in Singapore in 1922. Their social volunteer work, especially with the handicapped, has been credited with helping to restore Japanese people's reputation in the eyes of Chinese Singaporeans, badly damaged by atrocities during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. However, Tenrikyo remains largely a religion of Japanese expatriates, not of average Singaporeans. Its association with Shinto has proven a disadvantage in attempts to spread it beyond the Japanese community.\n\nTenrikyo's main \"rival\" in Singapore is the Buddhist organisation Sōka Gakkai. Originally, its following was also restricted to the Japanese expatriate community. However, it has had more success in outreach to local people, especially the ethnic Chinese community.\n\nAs with Japanese in other countries, golf is a popular leisure activity among Japanese businesspeople in Singapore. As the Japanese community in Singapore grew in the 1970s, they applied political pressure to promote upgrading of existing golf courses and development of new ones. Though other expatriates, as well as members of the local upper-middle class, also spoke out in support of the improvement of golfing facilities in Singapore, generally the Japanese were described as making the most forceful demands. Japanese membership in golf associations grew so quickly that many established quotas on the number of foreign members with the express purpose of preventing their \"inundation\" with Japanese expatriates and tourists, and also established a two-track pricing system, with higher prices for foreigners than locals. Due to the expense of playing golf in Singapore, lower-level Japanese personnel tend to head across the border into Johor Bahru, Malaysia in search of cheaper green fees.\n\nOther popular leisure pursuits include tennis, swimming, Mandarin and English language training, and cooking classes.\n\n\n"}

These include 55 Afro-Asiatic languages, 2 Nilo-Saharan languages, 4 Ubangian languages, and 169 Niger–Congo languages. This latter group comprises 1 Senegambian language (Fulfulde), 28 Adamawa languages, and 142 Benue–Congo languages (130 of which are Bantu languages).\nFrench and English are official languages, a heritage of Cameroon's colonial past as a colony of both France and the United Kingdom from 1916 to 1960. Eight out of the ten regions of Cameroon are primarily francophone, representing 83% of the country's population, and two are anglophone, representing 17%. The anglophone proportion of the country is in constant regression, having decreased from 21% in 1976 to 20% in 1987 and to 17% in 2005, and is estimated at 16% in 2015 (whose 4th census should take place in 2015).\n\nThe nation strives toward bilingualism, but in reality very few Cameroonians speak both French and English, and many speak neither. The government has established several bilingual schools in an effort to teach both languages more evenly, however, in reality most of these schools separate the anglophone and francophone sections and therefore do not provide a true bilingual experience. Cameroon is a member of both the Commonwealth of Nations and La Francophonie. German, the country's official language during the German colonial period until World War I, has nowadays almost entirely yielded to its two successors. However, as a foreign language subject German still enjoys huge popularity among pupils and students, with 300,000 people learning or speaking German in Cameroon in 2010. Today, Cameroon is one of the African countries with the highest number of people with knowledge of German.\n\nMost people in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest provinces speak Cameroonian Pidgin English as a lingua franca. Fulfulde serves the same function in the north, and Ewondo in much of the Center, South, and East provinces.\nCamfranglais (or Frananglais) is a relatively new pidgin communication form emerging in urban areas and other locations where Anglophone and Francophone Cameroonians meet and interact. Popular singers have used the hybrid language and added to its popularity.\n\nEducation for the deaf in Cameroon uses American Sign Language, introduced by the deaf American missionary Andrew Foster.\n\nThere is little literature, radio, or television programming in native Cameroonian languages. Nevertheless, a large number of Cameroonian languages have alphabets or other writing systems, many developed by the Christian missionary group SIL International, who have translated the Bible, Christian hymns, and other materials. The General Alphabet of Cameroon Languages was developed in the late 1970s as an orthographic system for all Cameroonian languages.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Bamum script was developed by Sultan Ibrahim Njoya to write the Bamum language.\n\nLiteracy in French for individuals of age 12 and above rose from 41.3% to 57.6% between 1987 and 2005 while that of English rose from 13.4% to 25.3%. The global proportion of individuals literate in official languages has thus markedly increased between 1987 and 2005, rising from 53.3% to 71.2%.\n\nIn 2005, the probability to be literate in French while being anglophone was 0.46 while that of being literate in English while being francophone was 0.20, resulting from the predominant status of the French language in Cameroon as a whole.\n\nSome of the common languages native to Cameroon include:\n\nMousgoum, Massa, Kotoko, and Mousseye are spoken on the Logone River in the Far North.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1554458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1554458", "title": "Muhammad al-Badr", "text": "Muhammad al-Badr\n\nMuhammad Al-Badr (February 15, 1926 – August 6, 1996) () was the last king of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen (North Yemen) and leader of the monarchist regions during the North Yemen Civil War (1962–1970). His full name was Al-Mansur Bi'llah Muhammad Al-Badr bin Al-Nasir-li-dinu'llah Ahmad, Imam and Commander of the Faithful and King of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of the Yemen.\n\nMuhammad al-Badr was born in 1926 as oldest son of Ahmad bin Yahya, later imam of the Zaydis and king of North Yemen. In 1944 he moved to Taizz in the south of the country, where his father had already been the Imam's deputy for several years, to continue his education. Soon after the assassination of Imam Yahya in February 1948 plotted by Sayyid Abdullah al-Wazir, al-Badr arrived in Sana'a, the capital, but apparently only gave tacit support to the new regime. Meanwhile, Sayf al-Islam Ahmad had managed to get away from Taizz and made for Hajjah, where he gathered the tribes around him, proclaimed himself Imam with the title of al-Nasir and within a month of the assassination had easily regained control of Sana'a and executed the principal perpetrators of the rebellion.\n\nSayf al-Islam al-Badr (as Muhammad now became), not yet 20, was clearly able to patch up speedily any misunderstandings with his father, for in late 1949 he was appointed his deputy over Hodeida, the important port on the Red Sea. He was also made Minister of the Interior.\n\nAl-Badr played a prominent role in quelling the revolt against his father, Imam Ahmad, in 1955 led by Ahmad's brother Sayf al-Islam Abdullah and afterwards was declared Crown Prince.\n\nIn that same year Ahmad bin Yahya forged connections and signed agreements during a tour to Soviet bloc countries. In April 1956 he signed a mutual defence pact with Egypt, involving a unified military command, and in 1958 incorporated Yemen with the United Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria into what then became the United Arab States.\n\nDuring the remaining period of Imam Ahmad's rule, Sayf al-Islam al-Badr held the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs and from 1958 he was also the Imam's deputy over Sana'a.\n\nLike most young Arab leaders of his generation, Al-Badr had been a great admirer of the Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. So in 1959 while he was in charge of Yemen for a few months during Imam Ahmad's absence in Italy for medical treatment, he arranged for Egyptian experts to come and help modernize the Yemen in all fields, including the military. His father annulled these upon his return.\n\nAn assassination attempt on the life of Imam Ahmad in March 1961 left the latter gravely crippled, so in October Sayf al-Islam al-Badr took over effective control of the government. On 19 September 1962 Ahmad died in his sleep, al-Badr was proclaimed Imam and King and took the title of al-Mansur.\n\nA week later rebels shelled his residence, Dar al-Bashair, in the Bir al-Azab district of Sana'a whence on September 26, 1962, Abdullah as-Sallal, whom al-Badr had appointed commander of the royal guard, staged a coup, and declared himself president of the Yemen Arab Republic.\n\nAl-Badr escaped to the north of North Yemen, and rallied tribes that support him in opposition to Sallal. Fighting erupted between the two groups, starting the North Yemen Civil War. Al-Badr started getting support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans received support from Egypt.\n\nAlthough the revolution had announced to the world that al-Badr had died beneath the rubble of his palace, he had in fact managed to escape unhurt and set out to the north. As he proceeded on his journey the tribes rallied round him pledging him their unconditional allegiance as Amir al-Mumineen (\"Prince of the Faithful\"). These tribes were Zaydi Shia for whom unstinted loyalty to an imam from the Ahl al-Bayt (the descendants of the Prophet) was a fundamental obligation of their religion. A few days later he held a press conference over the border in south-west Saudi Arabia. His uncle Sayf al-Islam al-Hasan, who had been abroad and had been proclaimed Imam at the news of al-Badr's alleged demise, immediately gave allegiance to him together with all the princes of the Hamid al-Din family. Soon the entire tribal confederation of Bakil along with most of Hashid who occupied the central and northern highlands of Yemen and who had been Zaydis for centuries joined enthusiastically the cause of the Imam and the princes to fight the revolutionary regime.\n\nDuring the bloody civil war which continued for eight years al-Badr, like his cousins, played a vital role. He lived alongside his men the life of a warrior, sharing with them every deprivation and hardship. He set up his headquarters in various places in the scenically spectacular mountainous north-west Yemen, on Jebal Qara, for instance, in the region of Hajur al-Sham and at al-Muhabisha high up above the Tihama plain. These HQs situated in caves fitted out with every basic facility deep in the mountainside were nevertheless constantly under the threat of Egyptian bombardment from the air. In 1967 al-Badr left his HQ at Mabyan near Hajjah for Taif in Saudi Arabia, where he stayed until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1970, despite the fact that territorially most of the Yemen remained under the control of al-Badr and the Hamid al-Din family, Saudi Arabia, which had been the principal opponent of the Sana'a regime, recognized the Yemen Arab Republic and other nations like the United Kingdom swiftly followed suit.\n\nStunned by Saudi Arabia's recognition of the republican regime which had been negotiated without any consultation with him whatsoever, al-Badr refused to stay any longer in Saudi Arabia and demanded that he be permitted to leave the kingdom immediately. He went to England, where he lived quietly in a modest house in Kent, only going abroad to visit the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and to call on relatives and friends in that part of the world.\n\nHe died in 1996 in London, and is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking, in Surrey.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26108815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26108815", "title": "My Way killings", "text": "My Way killings\n\nThe \"My Way\" killings are a social phenomenon in the Philippines, referring to a number of fatal disputes which arose due to the singing of the song \"My Way\", popularized by Frank Sinatra (peaking at #27 on Billboard Hot 100 in 1969), in karaoke bars. A \"New York Times\" article estimates the number of killings to be about six up to 2010. Another source estimates at least 12 between 2002–2012. Opinions differ over whether the possible connection is due to the coincidence that the song was simply frequently sung amid the nation's karaoke bars where violence is common or to the aggressive lyrics of the song itself.\n\nIn the decade up to 2010, about a half-dozen incidents occurred in the Philippines in connection with strenuous complaints over the singing of the song, prompting Filipino newspapers to name the phenomenon the \"'My Way' killings\".\n\nOn May 29, 2007, a 29-year-old karaoke singer of \"My Way\" at a bar in San Mateo, Rizal, was shot dead as he sang the tune, allegedly by the bar's security guard, who was arrested after the incident. According to reports, the guard complained that the young man's rendition was off-key, and when the victim refused to stop singing, the guard pulled out a .38-caliber pistol and shot the man dead.\n\nKaraoke singing is a widespread pastime in the Philippines, including among the poor, where many were earning about $2 a day in 2007 and could purchase time on a karaoke machine (called \"videoke\" machines in the Philippines) for 5 pesos (about 10 cents in US currency).\n\nSome Filipinos, even those who love the song, will not sing it in public in order to avoid trouble. As of 2007, the song reportedly had been taken off of the playlists of karaoke machines in many bars in Manila after complaints about out-of-tune renditions of the song resulted in fights and deaths. According to a 2007 Reuters news report, the \"My Way\" killing phenomenon had started a few years before.\n\nFilipinos who can afford to do so often get private rooms at karaoke bars. Violence in some bars has led owners of the establishments to employ \"bakla\" (gay or effeminate men, or trans women), who use humor in defusing conflicts between male patrons over women, since the \"bakla\" are seen as neutral. The same \"bakla\" are used to smooth over conflicts over karaoke singing.\n\nIn a parody of the killings, the Japanese band Kishidan released as their 10th Anniversary single an uptempo rock cover of \"My Way\". The promotional music video consisted of the lead singer Ayonocozy Show (DJ Ozma) being shot numerous times while singing. Ayonocozy is then shot once more in the back while walking away after the song is concluded, collapsing in a heap on the stairs. A shortened version was used as a commercial.\n\nThe phenomenon left one \"New York Times\" writer grasping for answers: \"Are the killings the natural byproduct of the country’s culture of violence, drinking and machismo? Or is there something inherently sinister in the song?\"\n\nKaraoke bars in the Philippines can often be very violent, with fights often sparked over breaches of karaoke etiquette – such as laughing at other performers, performing the same song twice, or hogging the microphone. According to Roland B. Tolentino, a pop culture expert at the University of the Philippines, the noticed number of killings connected to singing of the song may simply reflect its popularity in a violent environment. But he added that the song's \"triumphalist\" theme might also be a factor.\n\nYet other tunes, just as popular in the Philippines, have not resulted in murder. Butch Albarracin, the owner of Center for Pop, a Manila-based singing school, believes the lyrics of \"My Way\" increase the violence. \"The lyrics evoke feelings of pride and arrogance in the singer, as if you're somebody when you're really nobody,\" Albarracin said in a 2010 interview. \"It covers up your failures. That's why it leads to fights.\"\n\n\"Videoke rage\" is not just limited to \"My Way\" in the Philippines. \"There have been several reported cases of singers being assaulted, shot or stabbed mid-performance, usually over how songs are sung,\" according to a 2008 report in Britain's \"Guardian\" newspaper. In Malaysia in 2008, a man at a coffee shop hogged the karaoke microphone so long he was stabbed to death by other patrons. In Thailand, a man was arrested on charges that he shot to death eight neighbors, one of whom was his brother-in-law, in a dispute stemming from several karaoke offerings, including repeated renditions of John Denver's \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\". In July 2013, an American was stabbed to death for refusing to stop singing in a karaoke bar in Krabi, also in Thailand. \nIn China, a fight occurred over the microphone in a karaoke parlor, and a man hacked two others to death with a meat cleaver. There was also an incident in Seattle where a karaoke singer was punched and attacked by a woman in order to stop him singing Coldplay's \"Yellow\".\n"}

{"id": "13384598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13384598", "title": "Part exchange", "text": "Part exchange\n\nA part exchange or part exchange deal is a type of contract. In a part exchange, instead of one party to the contract paying money and the other party supplying goods/services, both parties supply goods/services, the first party supplying part money and part goods/services.\n\nWhether a part exchange is a sale or a barter is a fine point of law. It depends from whether a monetary value is assigned to the non-money goods supplied. Several cases at law clarify this. In the case of \"Flynn v Mackin and Mahon\" an old car was supplied in part exchange for a new car, along with £250. This was held to be a barter, because no monetary value was affixed to the old car. However, in \"Aldridge v Johnson\" a similar transaction was held to be a sale, because a monetary value was assigned to the item being exchanged (23 bullocks, valued at £192), and cash then used to make up the difference to the price of the item being purchased (100 quarters of barley, valued at £215). If the contract had been structured as \"23 bullocks and £23 for 100 quarters of barley\" then it could have qualified as barter. It is the affixture of the monetary value of £192 to the bullocks and £215 to the barley that made it a sale. Indeed, it is not necessary even for the contracting parties themselves to assign a monetary value to the goods for a part exchange deal to be held to be a sale. In \"Bull v Parker\", the court itself assigned a value (£4) for new riding equipment, sold for some old riding equipment and £2. If goods/services have obvious monetary values, then a part exchange deal can be held to be a sale.\n\nIt was held in \"Aldridge v Johnson\" that there were in fact two separate contracts, both of sale, rather than a single contract of barter. And this is one way that part exchange deals are viewed. Indeed, this is how they are always viewed in the United Kingdom for V.A.T. purposes. A supply of an old car in part exchange for a new one, at a car dealership, is two separate sales, and must be recorded by the dealer as such in account books, for V.A.T. purposes. Technically, the customer is making a \"supply\" for the discount given, providing the old car for an amount equal to the monetary discount, and the dealer is also making a \"supply\" for the full price, providing the new car for its full sale price.\n\nCar dealerships are one business sector where part exchange deals are common. They are less common in other sectors. In the housing sector, for example, only a few businesses will make part exchange deals. One such is Barratt Homes, where the part exchange deal, with buyers being offered discounts for part exchange of their old houses, has in fact been an integral part of the company's business model. There is another accounting nicety for the house builder in such deals, relating to when, exactly, to take the profit on the deal. House prices change over time, and it is possible that the housebuilder may not be able to eventually sell the old, exchanged, property for the same or more than the value that it was originally exchanged for. There are two extreme views on how to render accounts for such deals, and most accounting practices fall somewhere in the spectrum in between. The one extreme has the profit on the deal taken straightaway that the new house is sold, on the presumption that the old house will sell for its exchange value. The other extreme has the profit on the deal not taken at all until the entire deal has completed, including the sale onwards of the old house received in exchange. The major accounting considerations are making provisions at year's end for part exchange stock that remains unsold, and for the predicted marketing costs of selling it.\n\n"}

On summer weekends as many 3,000 pleasure boats with around 8,000 aboard gather in the cove lining up in two rows with newcomers running a gauntlet of water cannon and taunts to take their clothes off (although the \"Kansas City Star\" reports that the overwhelming number of visitors in the fraternity house environment are male).\n\nMissouri has 18 officers assigned to the entire Lake of the Ozarks. They had historically limited the policing of the cove to violations of wake restrictions, and boat driving violations and Boating While Intoxicated summons. Attempts to stop the practice of lashing the boats together failed to pass the Missouri General Assembly.\n\nMissouri says that the area around the cove is the most dangerous in the entire lake. After two people died in 2007, Missouri announced plans to have officers from other districts crack down on nudity (women can be topless but not bottomless), public sex acts, and drug use.\n\nIn 2007, Major General Bill McCoy, commander of the Fort Leonard Wood Army base, declared Party Cove \"off-limits\" to Army personnel from the base for safety and health issues after a Fort Leonard Wood soldier suffered a broken neck and a soldier and a civilian employee drowned in separate incidents in the cove area that summer. The April 30, 2010 list of \"off-limits\" establishments, however, no longer lists Party Cove as being off-limits to military personnel.\n\nThe cove has been featured on \"Playboy TV\", \"A Current Affair\", \"Sexcetera\", and is mentioned in season 1 episodes 5 and 6 of \"Ozark\".\n"}

Starting from his earliest years as an attorney representing clients at New York's Legal Aid Society, and teaching trial advocacy at Fordham School of Law from 1988–1991, he has focused on civil rights and the intersection of science and criminal justice.\n\nNeufeld was born in Brooklyn, New York on July 17, 1950 and grew up on Long Island. As a teenager, he was active in both civil rights and antiwar movements and spent time in Southeastern Kentucky as a member of the Encampment for Citizenship. In 1972, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.A. in history. In 1975, he earned a J.D. from the New York University School of Law.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1985, Neufeld worked as a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society in the Bronx, New York City. It was during these years his focus on the intersection of law and science emerged. Some of the people defended while at Legal Aid include:\n\nAfter leaving the Legal Aid Society, one of Neufeld's first cases was his defense, in 1988, of Damian Pizarro, a battered woman who killed her abuser in self-defense. This case was the first successful use of battered woman syndrome to secure an acquittal in New York County. The case was filmed and released as a documentary on British television where it helped leverage the creation of safe houses for women victimized by domestic violence.\n\nIn 1989, in People v. Castro, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck won an unprecedented pretrial hearing, precluding the use of inculpatory DNA evidence that at the time had not been validated for use in criminal prosecutions. The court's ruling and attendant experts' consensus report led to the National Academy of Sciences establishing a panel to develop scientific standards for forensic DNA analysis.\n\nIn 1991, in People v. McNulty, et al., Neufeld, with his wife Adele Bernhard, defended several Irish immigrants who had been beaten, falsely arrested and charged by the police in Yonkers, New York. After winning their acquittal, Neufeld successfully sued the police officers responsible for the beatings.\n\nIn 1995, Neufeld served on the defense team for O.J. Simpson's murder trial.\n\nIn 1996, Peter Neufeld, Barry Scheck and Johnnie Cochran established the law partnership Cochran Neufeld & Scheck, with a focus on representing plaintiffs victimized by the excessive force of state actors, those who were wrongfully convicted, and others who claimed their civil rights were violated by the police or the government. After Mr. Cochran's death, in 2009 the firm changed its name to Neufeld Scheck & Brustin. The litigation of the firm frequently results in systemic reforms accompanying any monetary compensation for plaintiffs. Some of the people Neufeld represented in private practice, either alone or as a member of a team include:\n\n\nIn 1992, Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck founded the Innocence Project to assist convicted prisoners who could be proven innocent post-conviction through DNA testing. To date, 343 people in the United States have been exonerated by DNA testing, including 20 who served time on death row. These people served an average of 14 years in prison before exoneration and release. The Innocence Project's full-time staff attorneys and Cardozo Law School clinic students provide direct representation or critical assistance in most of these cases. The Innocence Project states on its website that groundbreaking use of DNA technology to free innocent people has provided irrefutable proof that wrongful convictions are not isolated or rare events but instead arise from systemic defects. Now an independent nonprofit organization affiliated with Cardozo Law School, the Innocence Project's mission is to free innocent people who remain incarcerated and to bring substantive reform to the criminal justice system responsible for their unjust imprisonment. They get thousands of letters from wrongly convicted inmates every year.\n\nNeufeld taught trial advocacy at Fordham School of Law from 1988–1991. Currently he teaches Cardozo law students within the Innocence Project clinic. Neufeld has lectured throughout the world on the causes of wrongful convictions and appropriate remedies and specifically on the fundamental lack of scientific rigor in much of forensic science.\n\nIn 1995, he was appointed to serve on the New York State Commission on Forensic Science by then-Governor George Pataki.\n\nIn 2014, he was appointed by the U.S. Department of Justice to the National Commission on Forensic Science. As of 2016, Neufeld continues to serve on both commissions. He also chaired the Medical Committee of the Board of Trustees for the Montefiore Medical Center from 1995–2015.\n\nR.A. Leo, P.J.

{"id": "22975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22975", "title": "Polish language", "text": "Polish language\n\nPolish (\"język polski\" , \"polszczyzna\", or simply \"polski\") is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in Poland and is the native language of the Poles. It belongs to the Lechitic subgroup of the West Slavic languages written in Latin script. Polish is the official language of Poland, but it is also used by Polish minorities in other countries. There are over 50 million Polish language speakers around the world and it is one of the official languages of the European Union. \n\nPolish is written with the standard Polish alphabet, which has 9 additions to the letters of the basic Latin script (\"ą\", \"ć\", \"ę\", \"ł\", \"ń\", \"ó\", \"ś\", \"ź\", \"ż\"). Polish is closely related to Czech and Slovak. The language currently has the largest number of speakers of the West Slavic group and is also the second most widely spoken Slavic language.\n\nHistorically, Polish was known to be \"lingua franca\", an important language, both diplomatically and academically in Central and Eastern Europe. Today, Polish is spoken by over 38.5 million people as their first language in Poland. It is also spoken as a second language in northern Czech Republic and Slovakia, Hungary, western parts of Belarus and Ukraine, and central-western Lithuania. Because of the emigration from Poland during different time periods, most notably after World War II, millions of Polish speakers can be found in countries such as Israel, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and New Zealand.\n\nPolish began to emerge as a distinct language around the 10th century, the process largely triggered by the establishment and development of the Polish state. Mieszko I, ruler of the Polans tribe from the Greater Poland region, united a few culturally and linguistically related tribes from the basins of the Vistula and Oder before eventually accepting baptism in 966. With Christianity, Poland also adopted the Latin alphabet, which made it possible to write down Polish, until then existing only as a spoken language. \"It is worth mentioning,\" writes Tomasz Kamusella, \"that Polish is the oldest, non-ecclesiastical, written Slavic language with a continuous tradition of literacy and official use, which has lasted unbroken from the 16th century to this day.\"\n\nThe precursor to modern Polish is the Old Polish language. Ultimately, Polish is thought to descend from the unattested Proto-Slavic language. Polish was a \"lingua franca\" from 1500–1700 in Central and small portions of Eastern Europe, because of the political, cultural, scientific and military influence of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe Book of Henryków (Polish: \"Księga henrykowska\", ), contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language: \"Day, ut ia pobrusa, a ti poziwai\" (pronounced originally as: \"Daj, uć ja pobrusza, a ti pocziwaj,\" modern Polish: \"Daj, niech ja pomielę, a ty odpoczywaj\" or \"Pozwól, że ja będę mełł, a ty odpocznij\", English: \"Come, let me grind, and you take a rest\"), written around 1270.\n\nThe medieval recorder of this phrase, the Cistercian monk Peter of the Henryków monastery, noted that \"Hoc est in polonico\" (\"This is in Polish\").\n\nPoland is the most linguistically homogeneous European country; nearly 97% of Poland's citizens declare Polish as their first language. Elsewhere, Poles constitute large minorities in Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. Polish is the most widely used minority language in Lithuania's Vilnius County (26% of the population, according to the 2001 census results, with Vilnius having been part of Poland from 1922 until 1939) and is found elsewhere in southeastern Lithuania. In Ukraine it is most common in western Lviv and Volyn Oblasts, while in West Belarus it is used by the significant Polish minority, especially in the Brest and Grodno regions and in areas along the Lithuanian border. There are significant numbers of Polish speakers among Polish emigrants and their descendants in many other countries.\n\nIn the United States, Polish Americans number more than 11 million but most of them cannot speak Polish fluently. According to the 2000 United States Census, 667,414 Americans of age five years and over reported Polish as the language spoken at home, which is about 1.4% of people who speak languages other than English, 0.25% of the US population, and 6% of the Polish-American population. The largest concentrations of Polish speakers reported in the census (over 50%) were found in three states: Illinois (185,749), New York (111,740), and New Jersey (74,663). Enough people in these areas speak Polish that PNC Financial Services (which has a large number of branches in all of these areas) offer services available in Polish at all of their cash machines in addition to English and Spanish.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census there are now over 500,000 people in England and Wales who consider Polish to be their \"main\" language. In Canada, there is a significant Polish Canadian population: There are 242,885 speakers of Polish according to the 2006 census, with a particular concentration in Toronto (91,810 speakers) and Montreal.\n\nThe geographical distribution of the Polish language was greatly affected by the territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II and Polish population transfers (1944–46). Poles settled in the \"Recovered Territories\" in the west and north, which had previously been mostly German-speaking. Some Poles remained in the previously Polish-ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the USSR, resulting in the present-day Polish-speaking minorities in Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, although many Poles were expelled or emigrated from those areas to areas within Poland's new borders. To the east of Poland, the most significant Polish minority lives in a long, narrow strip along either side of the Lithuania-Belarus border. Meanwhile, the flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50), as well as the expulsion of Ukrainians and Operation Vistula, the 1947 forced resettlement of Ukrainian minorities to the Recovered Territories in the west of the country, contributed to the country's linguistic homogeneity.\n\nThe Polish language became far more homogeneous in the second half of the 20th century, in part due to the mass migration of several million Polish citizens from the eastern to the western part of the country after the Soviet annexation of the Kresy (Eastern Borderlands) in 1939, and the annexation of former German territory after World War II. This tendency toward a homogeneity also stems from the vertically integrated nature of the Polish People's Republic.\n\nThe inhabitants of different regions of Poland speak \"standard\" Polish somewhat differently, although the differences between regional dialects appear slight. First-language speakers of Polish have no trouble understanding each other, and non-native speakers may have difficulty distinguishing regional variations.\n\nPolish is normally described as consisting of four or five main dialects:\n\nKashubian, spoken in Pomerania west of Gdańsk on the Baltic Sea, is often considered a fifth dialect. It contains a number of features not found elsewhere in Poland, e.g. nine distinct oral vowels (vs. the five of standard Polish) and (in the northern dialects) phonemic word stress, an archaic feature preserved from Common Slavic times and not found anywhere else among the West Slavic languages. However, it \"lacks most of the linguistic and social determinants of language-hood\".\n\nMany linguistic sources about the Slavic languages describe Silesian as a dialect of Polish. However, many Silesians consider themselves a separate ethnicity and have been advocating for the recognition of a Silesian language. According to the last official census in Poland in 2011, over half a million people declared Silesian as their native language. Many sociolinguistic sources (e.g. by Tomasz Kamusella, Agnieszka Pianka, Alfred F. Majewicz, Tomasz Wicherkiewicz) assume that extralinguistic criteria decide whether something is a language or a dialect of the language: users of speech or/and political decisions, and this is dynamic (i.e. it changes over time). Also, language organizations such as SIL International and resources for the academic field of linguistics such as Ethnologue, Linguist List and others, for example the Ministry of Administration and Digitization recognized the Silesian language. In July 2007, the Silesian language was recognized by an ISO, and was attributed an ISO code of szl.\n\nSome additional characteristic but less widespread regional dialects include:\n\nPolish has six oral vowels (all monophthongs) and two nasal vowels. The oral vowels are (spelled \"i\"), (spelled \"y\"), (spelled \"e\"), (spelled \"a\"), (spelled \"o\") and (spelled \"u\" or \"ó\"). The nasal vowels are (spelled \"ę\") and (spelled \"ą\").\n\nThe Polish consonant system shows more complexity: its characteristic features include the series of affricate and palatal consonants that resulted from four Proto-Slavic palatalizations and two further palatalizations that took place in Polish and Belarusian. The full set of consonants, together with their most common spellings, can be presented as follows (although other phonological analyses exist):\n\nNeutralization occurs between voiced–voiceless consonant pairs in certain environments: at the end of words (where devoicing occurs), and in certain consonant clusters (where assimilation occurs). For details, see \"Voicing and devoicing\" in the article on Polish phonology.\n\nMost Polish words are paroxytones (that is, the stress falls on the second-to-last syllable of a polysyllabic word), although there are exceptions.\n\nPolish permits complex consonant clusters, which historically often arose from the disappearance of yers. Polish can have word-initial and word-medial clusters of up to four consonants, whereas word-final clusters can have up to five consonants. Examples of such clusters can be found in words such as \"bezwzględny\" ('absolute' or 'heartless', 'ruthless'), \"źdźbło\" ('blade of grass'), ('shock'), and \"krnąbrność\" ('disobedience'). A popular Polish tongue-twister (from a verse by Jan Brzechwa) is ('In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reed').\n\nUnlike languages such as Czech, Polish does not have syllabic consonants – the nucleus of a syllable is always a vowel.\n\nThe consonant is restricted to positions adjacent to a vowel. It also cannot precede \"i\" or \"y\".\n\nThe predominant stress pattern in Polish is penultimate stress – in a word of more than one syllable, the next-to-last syllable is stressed. Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress, e.g. in a four-syllable word, where the primary stress is on the third syllable, there will be secondary stress on the first.\n\nEach vowel represents one syllable, although the letter \"i\" normally does not represent a vowel when it precedes another vowel (it represents , palatalization of the preceding consonant, or both depending on analysis). Also the letters \"u\" and \"i\" sometimes represent only semivowels when they follow another vowel, as in \"autor\" ('author'), mostly in loanwords (so not in native \"nauka\" 'science, the act of learning', for example, nor in nativized \"Mateusz\" 'Matthew').\n\nSome loanwords, particularly from the Classical languages, have the stress on the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. For example, \"fizyka\" () ('physics') is stressed on the first syllable. This may lead to a rare phenomenon of minimal pairs differing only in stress placement, for example \"muzyka\" 'music' vs. \"muzyka\" - genitive singular of \"muzyk\" 'musician'. When additional syllables are added to such words through inflection or suffixation, the stress normally becomes regular. For example, \"uniwersytet\" (, 'university') has irregular stress on the third (or antepenultimate) syllable, but the genitive \"uniwersytetu\" () and derived adjective \"uniwersytecki\" () have regular stress on the penultimate syllables. Over time, loanwords become nativized to have penultimate stress.\n\nAnother class of exceptions is verbs with the conditional endings \"-by, -bym, -byśmy\", etc. These endings are not counted in determining the position of the stress; for example, zrobiłbym\" ('I would do') is stressed on the first syllable, and \"zrobilibyśmy\" ('we would do') on the second. According to prescriptive grammars, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings \"-śmy, -ście\", although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so \"zrobiliśmy\" 'we did' is said to be correctly stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third as \"zrobiliśmy\"). These irregular stress patterns are explained by the fact that these endings are detachable clitics rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of kogo zobaczyliście?\" ('whom did you see?') it is possible to say \"kogoście zobaczyli?\" – here \"kogo\" retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns.\n\nSome common word combinations are stressed as if they were a single word. This applies in particular to many combinations of preposition plus a personal pronoun, such as do niej\" ('to her'), na nas\" ('on us'), \"przeze mnie\" ('because of me'), all stressed on the bolded syllable.\n\nThe Polish alphabet derives from the Latin script, but includes certain additional letters formed using diacritics. The Polish alphabet was one of three major forms of Latin-based orthography developed for Slavic languages, the others being Czech orthography and Croatian orthography, the latter being a 19th-century invention trying to make a compromise between the first two. Kashubian uses a Polish-based system, Slovak uses a Czech-based system, and Slovene follows the Croatian one; the Sorbian languages blend the Polish and the Czech ones.\n\nThe diacritics used in the Polish alphabet are the \"kreska\" (graphically similar to the acute accent) in the letters \"ć, ń, ó, ś, ź\" and through the letter in \"ł\"; the \"kropka\" (superior dot) in the letter \"ż\", and the \"ogonek\" (\"little tail\") in the letters \"ą, ę\". The letters \"q, v, x\" are often not considered part of the Polish alphabet; they are used only in foreign words and names.\n\nPolish orthography is largely phonemic—there is a consistent correspondence between letters (or digraphs and trigraphs) and phonemes (for exceptions see below). The letters of the alphabet and their normal phonemic values are listed in the following table.\n\nThe following digraphs and trigraphs are used:\nVoiced consonant letters frequently come to represent voiceless sounds (as shown in the tables); this occurs at the end of words and in certain clusters, due to the neutralization mentioned in the \"Phonology\" section above. Occasionally also voiceless consonant letters can represent voiced sounds in clusters.\n\nThe spelling rule for the palatal sounds , , , and is as follows: before the vowel \"i\" the plain letters \"s, z, c, dz, n\" are used; before other vowels the combinations \"si, zi, ci, dzi, ni\" are used; when not followed by a vowel the diacritic forms \"ś, ź, ć, dź, ń\" are used. For example, the \"s\" in \"siwy\" (\"grey-haired\"), the \"si\" in \"siarka\" (\"sulphur\") and the \"ś\" in \"święty\" (\"holy\") all represent the sound . The exceptions to the above rule are certain loanwords from Latin, Italian, French, Russian or English—where \"s\" before \"i\" is pronounced as \"s\", e.g. \"sinus\", \"sinologia\", \"do re mi fa sol la si do\", \"Saint-Simon i saint-simoniści\", \"Sierioża\", \"Siergiej\", \"Singapur\", \"singiel\". In other loanwords the vowel \"i\" is changed to \"y\", e.g. \"Syria\", \"Sybir\", \"synchronizacja\", \"Syrakuzy\".\n\nThe following table shows the correspondence between the sounds and spelling:\n\nDigraphs and trigraphs are used:\nSimilar principles apply to , , and , except that these can only occur before vowels, so the spellings are \"k, g, (c)h, l\" before \"i\", and \"ki, gi, (c)hi, li\" otherwise. Most Polish speakers, however, do not consider palatalisation of \"k, g, (c)h\" or \"l\" as creating new sounds.\n\nExcept in the cases mentioned above, the letter \"i\" if followed by another vowel in the same word usually represents , yet a palatalisation of the previous consonant is always assumed.\n\nThe letters \"ą\" and \"ę\", when followed by plosives and affricates, represent an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant, rather than a nasal vowel. For example, \"ą\" in \"dąb\" (\"oak\") is pronounced , and \"ę\" in \"tęcza\" (\"rainbow\") is pronounced (the nasal assimilates to the following consonant). When followed by \"l\" or \"ł\" (for example \"przyjęli\", \"przyjęły\"), \"ę\" is pronounced as just \"e\". When \"ę\" is at the end of the word it is often pronounced as just .\n\nNote that, depending on the word, the phoneme can be spelt \"h\" or \"ch\", the phoneme can be spelt \"ż\" or \"rz\", and can be spelt \"u\" or \"ó\". In several cases it determines the meaning, for example: \"może\" (\"maybe\") and \"morze\" (\"sea\").\n\nIn occasional words, letters that normally form a digraph are pronounced separately. For example, \"rz\" represents , not , in words like \"zamarzać\" (\"freeze\") and in the name \"Tarzan\".\n\nNotice that doubled letters represent separate occurrences of the sound in question; for example \"Anna\" is pronounced in Polish (the double \"n\" is often pronounced as a lengthened single \"n\").\n\nThere are certain clusters where a written consonant would not be pronounced. For example, the \"ł\" in the words \"mógł\" (\"could\") and \"jabłko\" (\"apple\") might be omitted in ordinary speech, leading to the pronunciations \"muk\" and \"japko\" or \"jabko\".\n\nPolish is a highly inflected language, with relatively free word order, although the dominant arrangement is subject–verb–object (SVO). There are no articles, and subject pronouns are often dropped.\n\nNouns belong to one of three genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. A distinction is also made between animate and inanimate masculine nouns in the singular, and between masculine personal and non-masculine-personal nouns in the plural. There are seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative.\n\nAdjectives agree with nouns in terms of gender, case and number. Attributive adjectives most commonly precede the noun, although in certain cases, especially in fixed phrases (like \"język polski\", \"Polish (language)\"), the noun may come first; the rule of thumb is that generic descriptive adjective normally precedes (e.g. \"piękny kwiat\", “beautiful flower”) while categorising adjective often follows the noun (e.g. \"węgiel kamienny\", “black \ncoal”). Most short adjectives and their derived adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by inflection (the superlative is formed by prefixing \"naj-\" to the comparative).\n\nVerbs are of imperfective or perfective aspect, often occurring in pairs. Imperfective verbs have a present tense, past tense, compound future tense (except for \"być\" \"to be\", which has a simple future \"będę\" etc., this in turn being used to form the compound future of other verbs), subjunctive/conditional (formed with the detachable particle \"by\"), imperatives, an infinitive, present participle, present gerund and past participle. Perfective verbs have a simple future tense (formed like the present tense of imperfective verbs), past tense, subjunctive/conditional, imperatives, infinitive, present gerund and past participle. Conjugated verb forms agree with their subject in terms of person, number, and (in the case of past tense and subjunctive/conditional forms) gender.\n\nPassive-type constructions can be made using the auxiliary \"być\" or \"zostać\" (\"become\") with the passive participle. There is also an impersonal construction where the active verb is used (in third person singular) with no subject, but with the reflexive pronoun \"się\" present to indicate a general, unspecified subject (as in \"pije się wódkę\" \"vodka is drunk\"—note that \"wódka\" appears in the accusative). A similar sentence type in the past tense uses the passive participle with the ending \"-o\", as in \"widziano ludzi\" (\"people were seen\"). As in other Slavic languages, there are also subjectless sentences formed using such words as \"można\" (\"it is possible\") together with an infinitive.\n\nYes-no questions (both direct and indirect) are formed by placing the word \"czy\" at the start. Negation uses the word \"nie\", before the verb or other item being negated; \"nie\" is still added before the verb even if the sentence also contains other negatives such as \"nigdy\" (\"never\") or \"nic\" (\"nothing\"), effectively creating a double negative.\n\nCardinal numbers have a complex system of inflection and agreement. Zero and cardinal numbers higher than five (except for those ending with the digit 2, 3 or 4 but not ending with 12, 13 or 14) govern the genitive case rather than the nominative or accusative. Special forms of numbers (collective numerals) are used with certain classes of noun, which include \"dziecko\" (\"child\") and exclusively plural nouns such as \"drzwi\" (\"door\").\n\nPolish has, over the centuries, borrowed a number of words from other languages. When borrowing, pronunciation was adapted to Polish phonemes and spelling was altered to match Polish orthography. In addition, word endings are liberally applied to almost any word to produce verbs, nouns, adjectives, as well as adding the appropriate endings for cases of nouns, adjectives, diminutives, double-diminutives, augmentatives, etc.\n\nDepending on the historical period, borrowing has proceeded from various languages. Notable influences have been Latin (9th–18th centuries), Czech (10th and 14th–15th centuries), Italian (15th–16th centuries), French (18th–19th centuries), German (13–15th and 18th–20th centuries), Hungarian (14th–16th centuries) and Turkish (17th century). Currently, English words are the most common imports to Polish.\n\nThe Latin language, for a very long time the only official language of the Polish state, has had a great influence on Polish. Many Polish words (\"rzeczpospolita\" from \"res publica\") were direct borrowings from Latin. Latin was known to a larger or smaller degree by most of the numerous szlachta in the 16th to 18th centuries (and it continued to be extensively taught at secondary schools until World War II). Apart from dozens of loanwords, its influence can also be seen in a number of verbatim Latin phrases in Polish literature (especially from the 19th century and earlier).\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries, Mongolian words were brought to the Polish language during wars with the armies of Genghis Khan and his descendants, e.g. \"dzida\" (spear) and \"szereg\" (a line or row).\n\nWords from Czech, an important influence during the 10th and 14th–15th centuries include \"sejm\", \"hańba\" and \"brama\".\n\nIn 1518, the Polish king Sigismund I the Old married Bona Sforza, the niece of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian, who introduced Italian cuisine to Poland, especially vegetables. Hence, words from Italian include \"pomidor\" from \"pomodoro\" (tomato), \"kalafior\" from \"cavolfiore\" (cauliflower), and \"pomarańcza\", a portmanteau from Italian \"pomo\" (pome) plus \"arancio\" (orange). A later word of Italian origin is \"autostrada\" (from Italian \"autostrada\", highway).\n\nIn the 18th century, with the rising prominence of France in Europe, French supplanted Latin as an important source of words. Some French borrowings also date from the Napoleonic era, when the Poles were enthusiastic supporters of Napoleon. Examples include \"ekran\" (from French \"écran\", screen), \"abażur\" (\"abat-jour\", lamp shade), \"rekin\" (\"requin\", shark), \"meble\" (\"meuble\", furniture), \"bagaż\" (\"bagage\", luggage), \"walizka\" (\"valise\", suitcase), \"fotel\" (\"fauteuil\", armchair), \"plaża\" (\"plage\", beach) and \"koszmar\" (\"cauchemar\", nightmare). Some place names have also been adapted from French, such as the Warsaw borough of Żoliborz (\"joli bord\" = beautiful riverside), as well as the town of Żyrardów (from the name Girard, with the Polish suffix -ów attached to refer to the founder of the town).\n\nMany words were borrowed from the German language from the sizable German population in Polish cities during medieval times. German words found in the Polish language are often connected with trade, the building industry, civic rights and city life. Some words were assimilated verbatim, for example \"handel\" (trade) and \"dach\" (roof); others are pronounced the same, but differ in writing \"schnur\"—\"sznur\" (cord). As a result of being neighbours with Germany, Polish has many German expressions which have become literally translated (calques). The regional dialects of Upper Silesia and Masuria (Modern Polish East Prussia) have noticeably more German loanwords than other dialects.\n\nThe contacts with Ottoman Turkey in the 17th century brought many new words, some of them still in use, such as: \"jar\" (\"yar\" deep valley), \"szaszłyk\" (\"şişlik\" shish kebab), \"filiżanka\" (\"fincan\" cup), \"arbuz\" (\"karpuz\" watermelon), \"dywan\" (\"divan\" carpet), etc.\n\nFrom the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in 1025 through the early years of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth created in 1569, Poland was the most tolerant country of Jews in Europe. Known as the \"paradise for the Jews\", it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world's largest Jewish community of the time. As a result, many Polish words come from Yiddish, spoken by the large Polish Jewish population that existed until the Holocaust. Borrowed Yiddish words include \"bachor\" (an unruly boy or child), \"bajzel\" (slang for mess), \"belfer\" (slang for teacher), \"ciuchy\" (slang for clothing), \"cymes\" (slang for very tasty food), \"geszeft\" (slang for business), \"kitel\" (slang for apron), \"machlojka\" (slang for scam), \"mamona\" (money), \"manele\" (slang for oddments), \"myszygene\" (slang for lunatic), \"pinda\" (slang for girl, pejoratively), \"plajta\" (slang for bankruptcy), \"rejwach\" (noise), \"szmal\" (slang for money), and \"trefny\" (dodgy).\n\nThe mountain dialects of the Górale in southern Poland, have quite a number of words borrowed from Hungarian (e.g. \"baca\", \"gazda\", \"juhas\", \"hejnał\") and Romanian as a result of historical contacts with Hungarian-dominated Slovakia and Wallachian herders who travelled north along the Carpathians.\n\nThieves' slang includes such words as \"kimać\" (to sleep) or \"majcher\" (knife) of Greek origin, considered then unknown to the outside world.\n\nRecent loanwords come primarily from the English language, mainly those that have Latin or Greek roots, for example \"komputer\" (computer), \"korupcja\" (from 'corruption', but sense restricted to 'bribery'), etc. Concatenation of parts of words (e.g. \"auto-moto\"), which is not native to Polish but common in English, for example, is also sometimes used. When borrowing English words, Polish often changes their spelling. For example, Latin suffix '-tio' corresponds to \"-cja\". To make the word plural, \"-cja\" becomes \"-cje\". Examples of this include \"inauguracja\" (inauguration), \"dewastacja\" (devastation), \"recepcja\" (reception), \"konurbacja\" (conurbation) and \"konotacje\" (connotations). Also, the digraph \"qu\" becomes \"kw\" (\"kwadrant\" = quadrant; \"kworum\" = quorum).\n\nThe Polish language has influenced others. Particular influences appear in other Slavic languages and in German — due to their proximity and shared borders. Examples of loanwords include German \"Grenze\" (border), Dutch and Afrikaans \"grens\" from Polish \"granica\"; German \"Peitzker\" from Polish \"piskorz\" (weatherfish); German \"Zobel\", French \"zibeline\", Swedish \"sabel\", and English \"sable\" from Polish \"soból\"; and \"ogonek\" (\"little tail\") — the word describing a diacritic hook-sign added below some letters in various alphabets. \",\" a Polish, Slovak and Ruthenian word for \"mop\" or \"rag\" became part of Yiddish.\n\nThere is a substantial number of Polish words which officially became part of Yiddish, once the main language of European Jews. These include basic items, objects or terms such as a bread bun (Polish \"bułka\", Yiddish בולקע \"bulke\"), a fishing rod (\"wędka\", ווענטקע \"ventke\"), an oak (\"dąb\", דעמב \"demb\"), a meadow (\"łąka\", לאָנקע \"lonke\"), a moustache (\"wąsy\", וואָנצעס \"vontses\") and a bladder (\"pęcherz\", פּענכער \"penkher\"). \n\nQuite a few culinary loanwords exist in German and in other languages, some of which describe distinctive features of Polish cuisine. These include German and English \"Quark\" from \"twaróg\" (a kind of fresh cheese) and German \"Gurke\", English \"gherkin\" from \"ogórek\" (cucumber). The word \"pierogi\" (Polish dumplings) has spread internationally, as well as \"pączki\" (Polish donuts) and kiełbasa (sausage, e.g. \"kolbaso\" in Esperanto). As far as \"pierogi\" concerned, the original Polish word is already in plural (sing. \"pieróg\", plural \"pierogi\"; stem \"pierog-\", plural ending \"-i\"; NB. \"o\" becomes \"ó\" in a closed syllable, like here in singular), yet it is commonly used with the English plural ending \"-s\" in Canada and United States of America, \"pierogis\", thus making it a \"double plural\". A similar situation happened in the opposite direction to the Polish loanword from English \"czipsy\" (\"potato chips\")—from English \"chips\" being already plural in the original (\"chip\" + \"-s\"), yet it has obtained the Polish plural ending \"-y\".\n\nThe word \"spruce\" entered the English language from the Polish name of Prusy (a historical region, today part of Poland). It became \"spruce\" because in Polish, \"z Prus\", sounded like \"spruce\" in English (transl. \"from Prussia\") and was a generic term for commodities brought to England by Hanseatic merchants and because the tree was believed to have come from Polish Ducal Prussia. However, it can be argued that the word is actually derived from the Old French term \"Pruce\", meaning literally Prussia.\n\n\n\n"}

It competed against Canal 13’s \"Sabor A Ti\".\n\nThe last time Jovanka Antich (Claudia Di Girólamo) was in Chile, she was a teenager and had a secret, torrid affair with Raphael Dominguez (Francisco Melo) the son of a local well-to-do family. The affair ended badly, with both of them believing that the other betrayed them when really it was Raphael’s mother Victoria North (Marés González) with the help of the power hungry gypsy Drago (José Soza) who tricked the young lovers into hating each other and separating.\n\nThe day they had planned to run away together Raphael doesn’t show and Jovanka leaves Mejillones alone never to tell him she is pregnant. She ends up in Spain where she has a baby girl and marries a wealthy and good gypsy. They adopt two other girls, and the three of them grow up believing they all adopted.\n\nJovanka has now returned to Chile, with her daughters and now a widow, after 25 years to attend her father’s wedding. Her father, Melquíades (Héctor Noguera) has brought his whole tribe with him to Mejillones where he plans on marrying the young beauty Milenka California (Blanca Lewin). Jovanka finds herself once again in this town that brings back so many memories.\n\nMany of the townspeople like Victoria North have an adverse hatred and prejudice towards gypsies, but the town itself is doing poorly with many businesses on the verge of bankruptcy, and the arrival of the gypsies will change all that. It's not long before Jovanka runs into Raphael again, and Victoria, afraid that she'll be found out, comes to tell her to leave. Remembering all the pain of the past, still hurt and humiliated from Raphael’s abandonment, this only provokes Jovanka to shout out for the whole town to hear and know that the day Raphael Dominguez dies she will share her fortune and gold with everyone in the town.\n\nFrom here is where things get complicated. People start attempting plots against Raphael. Victoria and Drago once again plot together to get rid of Jovanka. And Drago has his own plans to get rid of his best friend Melquiades so that he can become the leader of the tribe. Jovanka meanwhile starts to fall in love with Raphael's brother Juan (Francisco Reyes) who unlike his brother has a great affection for the gypsies. However, he happens to be a priest. And his nephew and Raphael's son, Sebastián (Ricardo Fernández) becomes enamored with Maria Salomé (Francisca Imboden), Jovanka’s daughter, who may or may not be his sister.\n\n\n"}

As recently as 2007, the Berlin Department of Education (\"Senatsverwaltung für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung\") officially recommended use of the book in high schools as part of homophobia awareness trainings in social studies classes.\n\nIn spite of not having been translated into any other language as of 2008, since its first publication \"Tabu Homosexualität\" remains treated and quoted as a standard source internationally as well. As of 2008, it is found in a number of Western European libraries, and in the US is even available in libraries in 13 different states.\n\nIn the prefacing \"Einführung\", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg deals with the post-WWII mitigation of German laws forbidding same-sex activities, and her motivations for researching the issue of homophobia, an undertaking whereupon she came upon increasingly earlier and earlier manifestations each inspiring countless cultural derivations of this hatred.\n\nIn order to give an idea of the old age of negative prejudices directed against same-sex activities in the West, in Chapter I, \"Alte Nachrichten über die ethische Bewertung der männlichen Homosexualität bei germanischen Stämmen\" (\"Ancient sources on the ethical evaluation of male homosexuality by Germanic tribes\"), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg mainly discusses many ancient European writers (mostly Greek and Roman) denouncingly accusing other tribes and nations across Europe as tolerant towards same-sex activities as was a common form of slander in Classical Antiquity, the absurdity of which is emphasized by the fact that writers of accused groups often accused the accuser's nation of the same thing even if ignorant of the original accusation hauled towards themselves. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thereby also demonstrates the strong numinous taboo regarding same-sex activities making them a near-unmentionable vice, as no rational explanation for this ostracization is ever provided, these activities are invariably depicted as negative \"in themselves\".\n\nOnly three exceptions are mentioned where the purpose of slander is not immediately obvious: Greek philosopher Sextus Empiricus in the third volume of his \"Outlines of Pyrrhonism\" mentioned a tribe of \"Karmans\" among whom \"lewdness between men \"[...]\", as is said, is not regarded as abominable but just like any ordinary thing\". Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg identifies it as one of many examples of Sextus Empiricus's often-used rhethoric device of applying the most absurd properties to people, places, and other objects simply for the purpose of demonstrating basic rules of logic. The second exception is a note by Posidonius, quoted in Diodorus Siculus's \"Bibliotheca historica\", on Celtic sleeping customs which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg attributes to a misunderstanding of traditional separation of the sexes in daily life.\n\nThe third is an analysis of the common modern scholarly debate around the ritual killing of criminals regarded as altogether \"ignavi et imbellis et corpore infames\" (\"cowardly, unbelligerent, and perverted\") by proto-historic Germanics as mentioned by Tacitus in his \"Germania\", whereupon Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg first remarks that the complex issue of common Western homophobia as apparent in the presented material must be analyzed at a wider, more interdisciplinarian scope.\n\nAccording to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural anthropology, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society.\n\nIts roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural strata (see stratification (archeology), social stratification, and archaeological horizon) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. These three successive strata were the following:\n\n\nSee also Three-age system. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg interprets these three strata as relating to the trifunctional hypothesis by Georges Dumézil, of classic Indo-European society consisting of three distinct classes, clerical (= Shamanic), agricultural, and warrior. Yet other than Dumézil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg does not regard all three of these components as genuinely Indo-European or Proto-Indo-European. Instead, in regard of the Kurgan hypothesis and what Gimbutas saw as \"Old Europe\", Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg considers these three components as the result of successive superimposition of what originally were the above-mentioned three different cultures, with Indo-European culture in Europe and the Middle East since the Iron Age as the result. See Proto-Indo-European society for details.\n\nThe immediate cause of Indo-European homophobia, misogyny, and patriarchy was an ethnocentric culture shock when Proto-Indo-European tribes encountered the highly sensual \"Maternal Megalith Culture\" in general, and particularly last traces of Shamanic ritual transvestism and sex change absorbed within this culture. In proto-historic Norse culture for instance, the resulting religious stratification emerged as the cultural strata of the subdued and marginalized \"Maternal Megalith Culture\" and the subsequently dominant Indo-European influence respectively transformed into maternal, fertility Vanir and belligerent, patriarchal Æsir religion, with the mythological Æsir-Vanir War as a distorted cultural memory of Europe's Indo-Europeanization, similar to the story of The Rape of the Sabine Women in ancient Italy potentially recalling the same proto-historical process.\n\nFrom there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations which exhibited increasing levels of rationalization:\n\n\nIn \"Mannbarkeitsriten\" (1980) and \"Angst und Vorurteil\" (1989), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg further chronicles the re-enforcing influence of Western colonialism when Indo-European cultures began globally expanding from the Age of Discovery and Age of Conquests on, thus explorers and conquerors again came upon Shamanic cultures partly involving ritual fertility and sexual cults, and Europe simultaneously encountered the wide spread of syphilis through these new cross-cultural contacts just when modern science began to dawn.\n\nThese processes also fostered ethnocentric beliefs of Indo-European moral superiority over \"uncivilized\", sensual, and \"filthy\" \"savages\" (see for instance the saying of the \"White man's burden\" of being morally obliged to \"civilize\" non-Westerners), social and ethnic \"aliens\", and marginalized minorities in a complex process of interior socio-psychological, cultural structuring of human sensual desires on the one hand, and foreign political and military colonialism of these desires on the other hand. Thus, in all three books (\"Tabu Homosexualität\", \"Mannbarkeitsriten\", and \"Angst und Vorurteil\") Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg alludes to cultural anthropology works such as \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" by Hannah Arendt, Freud's \"Civilization and Its Discontents\", Herbert Marcuse's \"Eros and Civilization\", Critical Theory's \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" and \"The Authoritarian Personality\", or \"The Civilizing Process\" by Norbert Elias.\n\nFinally, as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg relates in \"Angst und Vorurteil\", just as colonialism and the rise of syphilis had compromised the scientific Enlightenment approach to sexuality, the impact of HIV corrupted post-WWII progressive counterculture's influence on Western society's attitudes towards sexuality.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2619719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2619719", "title": "Telugu literature", "text": "Telugu literature\n\nTelugu literature or Telugu Sahityam () is the body of works written in the Telugu language. It consists of poems, novels, short stories, dramas and puranas. Telugu literature can be traced back to the early 10th century period (\"Prabandha Ratnavali\"(1918) talk about the existence of Jain Telugu literature during 850-1000AD) followed by 11th century period when Mahabharata was first translated to Telugu from Sanskrit by Nannaya. It flourished under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire, where Telugu was one of the empire's official languages.\n\nTelugu split from Proto-Dravidian between 1500-1000 BC. Telugu became a distinct language by the time any literary activity began to appear in the Tamil land, along with Parji, Kolami, Nayaki and Gadaba languages.\n\nThere are various sources available for information on early Telugu writers. Among these are the prologues to their poems, which followed the Sanskrit model by customarily giving a brief description of the writer, a history of the king to whom the book is dedicated, and a chronological list of the books he published. In addition, historical information is available from inscriptions that can be correlated with the poems; there are several grammars, treatises, and anthologies that provide illustrative stanzas; and there is also information available from the lives of the poets and the traditions that they followed.\nEarly Telugu literature is predominantly religious in subject matter. Poets and scholars drew most of their material from, and spent most of their time translating epics, such as the \"Ramayana\", the \"Mahabharata\", the \"Bhagavata\" and the \"Puranas\", all of which are considered to be storehouses of Indian culture.\n\nFrom the sixteenth century onwards, rarely known episodes from the \"Puranas\" would form the basis for the tradition of Telugu-language \"kavya\". Literary works are drawn from episodes of the \"Puranas\" under the name \"Akhyana\" or \"Khanda\" became popular along with depictions of the fortune of a single hero under the title of Charitra, Vijaya, Vilasa and Abhyudaya. Such titles are examples of what would become the most common subject matter of poetry.\n\nIn the eighteenth-century, marriages of heroes under the title Parinaya, Kalyana and Vivāha became popular.\n\nReligious literature consisted of biographies of the founders of religion, their teachings (\"Sara\") as well as commentaries (\"bhashya\").\n\nTraditional Hindu knowledge systems such as astrology, law, grammar, ballets, moral aphorisms, and devotional psalms to deities within the Hindu pantheon are characteristics of more popular works of Telugu literature.\n\nThe various forms of literature found in Telugu are:\nAshtadiggajas have written in all three of the \"Prabandham\" genres during the \"Prabandha yugam\".\n\nTelugu literature uses a unique expression in verse called Champu, which mixes prose and poetry. Although it is the dominant literary form, there are exceptions: for example, Tikkana composed \"Uttara Ramayana\" entirely in verse.\n\nAs Champu Kavyas and Prabandhas were beyond the comprehension of masses, new devices for the dissemination of knowledge among the people were developed in the form of the Dvipada and Shataka styles. Dvipada means two feet (couplet) and Shataka means hundred (a cento of verses). (Popular shatakas: Sarveshvara shataka, Kalahastishvara shataka, Dasarathi Shataka)\n\nThere are some Shatakas which are divided into ten groups of ten verses called Dasaka which is adopted from Prakrit.\n\nAvadhanam is a literary performance popular from the very ancient days in Sanskrit and more so in Telugu and Kannada languages. It requires a good memory and tests a person's capability of performing multiple tasks simultaneously. All the tasks are memory intensive and demand an in-depth knowledge of literature, and prosody. The number of Prucchakas can be 8 (Ashtavadhanam) or 100 (Shataavadhaanam) or even 1000 (Sahasravadhanam). A person who has successfully performed Ashtavadhanam is called as Ashtavadhani, a Shatavadhanam is called a Shatavadhani and Sahasraavadhaanam is called Sahasravadhani.\n\nPraudha Prabandha or Maha Kavya is considered as highest form of verse. The essentials of such a composition according to the Telugu poetic theory are\n\nIn the earliest period, Telugu literature existed in the form of inscriptions, precisely from 575 AD on-wards.\n\nThe 6th or 7th century Sanskrit text \"Jānāśrayī Chandoviciti\" (or \"Janāśraya-chandas\") deals with the metres used in Telugu, including some metres that are not found in Sanskrit prosody. This indicates that Telugu poetry existed during or around the 6th century.\n\nHistorically, Vemulawada was a Jain knowledge hub and played a significant role in patronizing Jain literature and poets.1980s excavations around Vemulawada revealed and affirmed the existence of Telugu Jain literature between 850-1000 AD.\n\nMalliya Rechana has composed the first Telugu poetic prosody book Kavijanasrayam( Pre-Nannayya chandassu) around 940 AD. This was a popular one and referred by many poets. There seems to be even an earlier prosody book by Rechana's guru Vaadindra Chudamani which is not available.\n\nVeturi Prabhakara Sastry in 1900s mentioned about the existence of \"Pre-Nannayya Chandassu\" in Raja Raja Narendra Pattabhisekha Sanchika. Accurate dating of this piece of literature happened after the 1980s discoveries in Karimnagar.\n\n\"Prabandha Ratnavali\"(1918) also talks about a verse from Telugu \"Jinendra Puranam\" by Jain Padma Kavi(Pampa), a couple of verses from Telugu \"Adi Puranam\" by Sarvadeva and \"Kavijanasrayam\"'s affiliation to Jainism were discussed.P.V.P Sastry also points out that many Jain works could have been destroyed. Historical rivalry among Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism is well known\n\nThis is the period of Kavi Trayam or Trinity of Poets. Nannayya, Tikkana and Yerrapragada (or Errana) are known as the Kavi Trayam.\n\nNannaya Bhattarakudu's () \"Andhra mahabharatam\", who lived around the 11th century, is commonly referred to as the first Telugu literary composition (\"aadi kaavyam\"). Although there is evidence of Telugu literature before Nannaya, he is given the epithet \"Aadi Kavi\" (\"the first poet\"). Nannaya was the first to establish a formal grammar of written Telugu. This grammar followed the patterns which existed in grammatical treatises like Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vālmīkivyākaranam but unlike Pāṇini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering samjnā, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya.\nNannaya completed the first two chapters and a part of the third chapter of the \"Mahabharata\" epic, which is rendered in the Champu style.\n\nNannaya's \"Andhra Mahabharatam\" was almost completed by Tikanna Somayaji () (1205–1288) who wrote chapters 4 to 18.\n\nErrapragada, () who lived in the 14th century, finished the epic by completing the third chapter. He mimics Nannaya's style in the beginning, slowly changes tempo and finishes the chapter in the writing style of Tikkana. These three writers – Nannaya, Tikanna and Yerrapragada – are known as the \"Kavitraya\" (\"three great poets\") of Telugu. Other such translations like Marana’s \"Markandeya Puranam\", Ketana’s \"Dasakumara Charita\", Yerrapragada’s \"Harivamsam\" followed. Many scientific works, like \"Ganitasarasangrahamu\" by Pavuluri Mallana and \"Prakirnaganitamu\" by Eluganti Peddana, were written in the 12th century.\n\n\"Sumati Shatakam\", which is a \"neeti\" (\"moral\"), is one of the most famous Telugu Shatakams. Shatakam is composed of more than a 100 \"padyalu\" (poems). According to many literary critics \"Sumati Shatakam\" was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu () (CE 1220–1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi, and a pupil of Tikkana. If we assume that the \"Sumati Shatakam\" was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Shatakams in Telugu along with the \"Vrushadhipa Satakam\" of Palkuriki Somanatha and the \"Sarveswara Satakam\" of Yathavakkula Annamayya. The \"Sumatee Shatakam\" is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as C. P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s.\n\nSrinatha () (1365–1441) popularised the \"Prabandha\" style of composition. He was a minister in the court of Pedakomati Vemareddy of Kondaveedu and wrote \"Salivahana Saptasati\", \"Shivaratri Mahatyam\", \"Harivilasa\", \"Bhimakanda\", \"Kashi khandam\", \"Shringara Naishadham\", \"Palanati Veera charitra\", \"Dhananjaya Vijayam\", \"Sringara Dipika\". These works were concerned with history and mythology. Srinatha's \"Srungara Naishadhamu\" is a well-known example of the form. Srinatha was widely regarded as the \"Kavi Sarvabhowma\" (\"the emperor among poets\").\n\nKumaragiri Vema Reddy (), popularly known as Yogi Vemana, was a 14th-century Telugu poet. His poems were written in the popular vernacular of Telugu, and are known for their use of simple language and native idioms. His poems discuss the subjects of Yoga, wisdom and morality. There is no consensus among scholars about the period in which Vemana lived. C.P. Brown, known for his research on Vemana, estimates the year of birth to be the year 1352 based on some of his verses. His poems are four lines in length. The fourth line is, in the majority of the cases, the chorus \"Vishwadhabhirama Vinura Vema\" – he thus conveyed his message with three small lines written in a simple vernacular. He traveled widely across south India, acquiring popularity as a poet and Yogi. So high was the regard for Vemana that a popular Telugu saying goes 'Vemana's word is the word of the Vedas'. He is celebrated for his style of \"Chaatu padyam\", a poem with a hidden meaning. Many lines of Vemana's poems are now colloquial phrases of the Telugu language. They end with the signature line \"Vishwadhaabhi Raama, Vinura Vema\", literally \"Beloved of Vishwadha, listen Vema\". There are many interpretations of what the last line signifies.\n\nBammera Potanaamatya () (1450–1510) is best known for his translation of the \"Bhagavata Purana\" from Sanskrit to Telugu. His work, \"Andhra Maha Bhagavatamu\". He was born into a Brahmin family and was considered to be a \"Sahaja Kavi\" (\"natural poet\") who needed no teacher. He wrote \"Bhogini Dandakam\" a poem praising king Singa Bhoopala’s consort danseuse, Bhogini, while young. This is the earliest available Telugu \"Dandaka\" (a rhapsody which uses the same gana or foot throughout). His second work was \"Virabhadra Vijayamu\" which describes the adventures of Virabhadra, son of Shiva. As a young man, he was a devotee of Shiva and also Rama and was more interested in salvation, from which came the inspiration to translate the \"Bhagavata Purana\".\n\nTallapaka Annamacharya (or Annamayya) () (9 May 1408 – 23 February 1503) is known as the \"Pada-kavita Pitaamaha\" of the Telugu language. He was born to a Vaidiki Brahmin family and his works are considered to have dominated and influenced the structure of Carnatic music compositions. Annamacharya is said to have composed as many as 32,000 sankeertanas (songs) on Bhagwaan Govinda Venkateswara, of which only about 12,000 are available today. His keertana compositions are based on the Vishishtadvaita school of thought. Annamayya was educated in this system of Ramanuja by Sri Satagopa Yateendra of the Ahobila matham.\n\nTallapaka Tirumalamma () (Annamacharya's wife) wrote \"Subhadra Kalyanam\", and is considered the first female poet in Telugu literature. Her main work, \"Subhadra Kalyanam\", which consists of 1170 poems, is about the marriage of Arjuna and Subhadra, who are characters that appear in the \"Mahabharata\". She presented the Telugu nativity and culture in the story taken from Sanskrit epic.\n\nAllasani Peddana () (15th and 16th centuries) was ranked as the foremost of the \"Ashtadiggajalu\" the title for the group of eight poets in the court of Krishnadevaraya, a ruler of the Vijayanagara Empire. Peddana was a native of Somandepalli near Anantapur.\nAllasani Peddana wrote the first major \"Prabandha\" and for this reason he is revered as \"Andhra Kavita Pitamaha\" (\"the grand father of Telugu poetry\"). It is believed that he was also a minister in the king's court and is hence sometimes referred as \"Peddanaamaatya\" (\"Peddana\" + \"Amaatya\" = Peddana, the minister). He wrote \"Swaarochisha Manu Sambhavam\" (also known as \"Manu Charitra\"), which is a development of an episode in the Markandeya Purana relating to the birth of Svarochishamanu, who is one of the fourteen Manus. Pravarakhya is a pious Brahmin youth who goes to the Himalayas for Tapasya. In the Himalayas Varudhini, a Gandharva girl, falls in love with him, but Pravarakyudu rejects her love. Knowing this a Gandharva youth who was earlier rejected by Varudhini assumes the form of Pravarakhya and succeeds to win her love. To them is born Svarochisha, the father of Svarochishamanu. The theme for his \"Manu Charitra\" is a short story from Markandeya Purana. It is about second \"Manu\" of fourteen manus (fathers of mankind societies according to Hindu mythology), translated into Telugu from Sanskrit by Marana (1291–1323), disciple of Tikkana. The original story was around 150 poems and Peddana extended into six chapters with 600 poems by adding fiction and descriptions.\n\nHis work was treated as one of the \"Pancha Kavyas\", the five best works in Telugu. Some of his other famous works such as \"Harikathaasaaramu\" are untraceable now.\n\nDhurjati or Dhoorjati () (15th and 16th centuries) was a poet in the court of Krishnadevaraya and was one of the 'Ashtadiggajalu'. He was born to Singamma and Narayana in Sri Kalahasti and was the grandson of Jakkayya.. His works include \"Sri Kalahasteeshwara Mahatyam\" (The grace/miracles of Lord Shiva) and \"Sri Kalahasteeshwara Shatakam\" (100+ poems in the praise of Lord Shiva). Dhurjati took themes from Puranas and added local stories and myths in his work. Unlike contemporaries such as Peddana and Mallana, who chose the stories of kings, he chose devotion as his theme.. Krishnadevaraya praised Dhurjati, saying \"Stuti mati yaina Andhrakavi Dhurjati palkulakelagalgeno yetulita madhuri mahima...\" (How is Dhurjati's poetry so immeasurably beautiful) On a personal note, he was known as \"Pedda Dhurjati\" (\"elder Dhurjati\") as there were four other people from the same family line who went by the name of Dhurjati during the same period and after him.. His grandson Venkataraya Dhurjati, wrote \"Indumati Parinayam\" (\"marriage of Indumati\"), a story from Kalidasa's Raghuvamsam.\n\nKrishnadevaraya () was an emperor of Vijayanagara Kingdom. Literary activities flourished during the rule of the Vijayanagara dynasty, and the period of Krishnadevaraya's rule in the sixteenth century is considered to be the golden age of Telugu literature. Krishnadevaraya, a poet himself, introduced the \"Prabandha\" to Telugu literature. \"Amukta Malyada\". Krishna Deva Raya wrote the book \"Amuktamalyada\" in Telugu, describing the pangs of separation suffered by Andal (an incarnation of the goddess Mahalakshmi. He describes Andal’s physical beauty in thirty verses; using descriptions of the spring and the monsoon as metaphors. As elsewhere in Indian poetry, the sensual pleasure of union extends beyond the physical level and becomes a path to, and a metaphor for, spirituality and ultimate union with the divine. His court had the \"Ashtadiggajas\" (\"eight elephants\"), who were considered to be the greatest of poets of that time. Some critics dismiss the following period, dominated by \"prabandhas\", as a decadent age. Of the dozens of works of the eighteenth- to mid-nineteenth century, Kankanti Paparaju’s \"Uttara Ramayana\" in \"campu\" style, and the play \"Vishnumayavilasa\" stand out. Other genres bloomed at the same time. Yakshaganas, indigenous dramas of song and prose, were also produced.\n\nGarlapati Tenali Ramakrishna (), popularly known as Tenali Rama and Vikata Kavi, was another sixteenth-century court poet of the Vijayanagara empire and also one of the \"Ashtadiggajas\". His family had originally hailed from Tenali in Guntur District, he was born in a Telugu Niyogi Brahmin family. His famous work \"Panduranga Mahatyamu\" is one among the Pancha Kavyas. He dedicated that to Viruri Vedadri. This book is about the Pundarika Kshetram on the banks of river Bhaimi and its legend. He also composed \"Udbhataradhya Charitram\" on the story of Udbhata, a monk, as well as \"Ghatikachala Mahatyam\" about Ghatikachalam, a place of worship for God Narasimha near Vellore. He followed the Prabandha style. He took the theme for \"Panduranga Mahatyam\" from the Skanda Purana and enhanced it with many stories about the devotees of God Vitthala (Panduranga). He is noted for brilliance and wit and for mocking other poets and great personalities. He created a celebrated character called \"Nigama Sarma akka\" (sister of Nigama Sarma) and a story about her without giving her a name. He also had written many \"Chatuvu\" (extempore poems).\n\nKshetrayya or Kshetragna () () was a prolific poet and composer of Carnatic music. He lived in the area of Andhra Pradesh. He composed a number of \"padams\" and \"keertanas\", the prevalent formats of his time. He is credited with more than 4000 compositions, although only a handful have survived. He composed his songs on his favourite deity Krishna (Gopala) in Telugu. He perfected the \"padam\" format that is still being used today. His \"padams\" are sung in dance (Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi) and music recitals. A unique feature of his padams is the practice of singing the \"anupallavi\" first then the \"pallavi\" (second verse followed by first verse). Most of the padams are of the theme of longing for the coming of the lord Krishna. He wrote with Sringara as a main theme in expressing \"madhurabhakti\" (devotion to the supreme). Sringara is a motif where the mundane sexual relationship between a Nayaki (woman) and a Nayaka (man) is used as a metaphor, denoting the yearning of jeeva (usually depicted as the Nayaki) to unite with the divine (usually depicted as the man). In most of his compositions, Kshetrayya has used the \"mudra\" (signature) \"Muvva Gopala\" as a reference to himself, which is also a name for Lord Krishna in Kshetrayya's village Muvva, now called as Movva. Kshetrayya's work has played a major role in influencing poetry, dance, music of the South Indian tradition. Kshetrayya was intimately connected with the devadasi women of the temples of south India, who were the subject of many of his compositions. The devadasis were traditionally in possession of the musical/poetic interpretations of his work for a long period of time till the devadasi system was abolished and the compositions became more accepted in the musical community as valuable works of art. The musical community also owes a lot to Veena Dhanammal and T. Brinda, who popularised Kshetrayya's songs with their beautiful musical interpretation. Kshetrayya's padyams now form an integral part of the dance and musical traditions of South India, where his songs are rendered purely as musical works or as accompaniments to dance.\n\nKancherla Gopanna () (c 1620–1680 CE), popularly known as Bhadradri Ramadasu or Bhadrachala Ramadasu (), was a 17th-century Indian devotee of Rama and a composer of Carnatic music. He is one among the famous vaggeyakaras (same person being the writer and composer of a song) in the Telugu language. His devotional lyrics to Rama are famous in South Indian classical music as \"Ramadaasu Keertanalu\". Even the doyen of South Indian classical music Saint Thyagaraja learned and later improved the style now considered standard kriti form of music composition. He also has written Dasarathi Shatakamu a collection of nearly 100 poems dedicated to the son of Dasaratha (Lord Rama).\n\nTarikonda Venkamamba (Telugu:తారికొండ వెంకమాంబ ; alternate spelling: Vengamamba, born 1730) was a poet and staunch devotee of Lord Venkateswara in the 18th century. She wrote numerous poems and songs.\n\nTyagaraja or Tyagabrahmam () (1767–1847) of Tanjore composed devotional songs in Telugu, which form a big part of the repertoire of Carnatic music. In addition to nearly 600 compositions (kritis), Tyagaraja composed two musical plays in Telugu, the \"Prahalada Bhakti Vijayam\" and the \"Nauka Charitam\". \"Prahlada Bhakti Vijayam\" is in five acts with 45 \"kritis\" set in 28 ragas and 138 verses, in different metres in Telugu. \"Nauka Charitam\" is a shorter play in one act with 21 \"kritis\" set in 13 \"ragas\" and 43 verses. The latter is the most popular of Tyagaraja's operas, and is a creation of the composer's own imagination and has no basis in the \"Bhagavata Purana\". Often overlooked is the fact that Tyagaraja's works are some of the best and most beautiful literary expressions in Telugu language. Valmiki composed the Ramayana, the story of Rama, with 24,000 verses and also composed 24,000 kritis in praise of the lord.\n\nParavastu Chinnayasuri () (1807–1861) wrote \"Baala Vyaakaranamu\" in a new style after doing extensive research on \"Andhra Grammar\" which is his greatest gift to Telugu people. Other notable works of Chinnayasuri include \"Neeti Chandrika\", \"Sootandhra Vyaakaranamu\", \"Andhra Dhatumoola\" and \"Neeti Sangrahamu\". Chinnayasuri translated Mitra Labham and Mitra Bhedam from the Sanskrit Panchatantra as \"Neeti Chandrika\". Kandukuri Veeresalingam and Kokkonda Venkata Ratnam Pantulu followed his style of prose writing and wrote \"Vigrahamu\" and \"Sandhi\" in a different pattern.\n\nKandukuri Veereshalingam (Telugu: కందుకూరి వీరేశలింగం) (also known as Kandukuri Veereshalingam Pantulu (Telugu: కందుకూరి వీరేశలింగం పంతులు), (16 April 1848 – 27 May 1919) was a social reformer of Andhra Pradesh. He was born in an orthodox Andhra Brahmin family. He is widely considered as the man who first brought about a renaissance in Telugu people and Telugu literature. He was influenced by the ideals of Brahmo Samaj particularly those of Keshub Chunder Sen. Veereshalingam panthulu is popularly called \"Gadya Tikkana\". He wrote about 100 books between 1869 and 1919 and introduced the essay, biography, autobiography and the novel into Telugu literature His \"Satyavati Charitam\" was the first social novel in Telugu. He wrote \"Rajashekhara Charitamu\" inspired by Oliver Goldsmith’s \"The Vicar of Wakefied\". To him literature was an instrument to fight social evils.\n\nMangalampalli Balamurali Krishna () (born 6 July 1930) is a Carnatic vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and a playback singer. He is also acclaimed as a poet, composer and respected for his knowledge of Carnatic Music. Balamuralikrishna was born in Sankaraguptam, East Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh state. Dr Balamuralikrishna has composed over 400 compositions in various languages like Telugu and Sanskrit. His compositions range from Devotional to Varnams, Kirtis, Javalis, and Thillans. His greatest achievement is the compositions in all the fundamental 72 melakarta ragas.\n\nAacharya Aatreya () or \"Kilambi Venkata Narasimhacharyulu\" (7 May 1921 – 13 September 1989) was a playwright, lyrics and story writer of the Telugu film industry. He was born as Kilambi Venkata Narasimhacharyulu on 7 May 1921 in the Mangalampadu village of Sullurpeta Mandalam in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. His pen name is based on their family Gotra. Known for his poetry on the human soul and heart, he was given the title 'Manasu Kavi'(Poet of Heart), which can be rewritten as 'Mana Su Kavi'(Our Good Poet). His poetry is philosophical and intellectually satisfying.\n\nTripuranēni Rāmasvāmi (January 15, 1887 – January 16, 1943) was a lawyer, famous poet, playwright and reformer active among the Telugu-speaking people. Popularly known as Kaviraju, he is considered the first poet to introduce rationalism and humanism into Telugu poetry and literature. Ramaswamy chose literary writing as the vehicle for expressing his rationalist thoughts. His famous work 'Sutaparanam' in four cantos was a fierce attack on the ancient Puranas, he has attained the state of excellence in poetic&literary criticism. His poetic work \"Kuppuswamy Satakam\" reveals the theme of social revolution and talks about social evils, blind faith, and indignity to man. He was against Congress and its fight against independence.\nIn his other works such as \"Sambhukavadha\", \"Suthashrama geetaalu', 'Dhoorta maanava', 'Khooni', 'Bhagavadgita', 'Rana Pratap' and 'Kondaveeti patanam', he made a rational analysis of dogmas prescribed by ancient classics and the injustice these dogmas did to people belonging to the lower social orders. Moreover, he attacked discriminatory practices and fought against the idea of untouchability. Sambhuka Vadha created a lot of controversies. Sambhuka was a character who did tapas to go heaven with the live body before death. That was considered as adharma and was killed by Lord Rama. This story was interpreted that Brahmins do not like doing tapas by non-Brahmins, which is why Sabhuka was killed.\n\n\nGrowing Internet users in India led to the birth of online platforms that bring Telugu writers closer to more readers. Pratilipi, SuKatha and Kahaniya are prominent among the new platforms.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34675107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34675107", "title": "Tibetan Aid Project", "text": "Tibetan Aid Project\n\nThe Tibetan Aid Project (TAP) is an operation of the Tibetan Nyingma Relief Foundation. TAP was founded in 1969 by Tarthang Tulku—a leading Tibetan master and teacher—to support the courageous efforts of Tibetans to survive in exile and re-establish their rich cultural heritage. It is a 501 c (3) non-profit organization that primarily focuses on raising funds for the production, shipment and distribution of sacred texts, art and prayer wheels for the World Peace Ceremony in Bodh Gaya, India.\n\nDuring the Chinese invasion of 1959, more than 1 million Tibetans were killed and 6,237 monasteries were destroyed along with their libraries. Over the years, TAP has filled hundreds of libraries with Tibetan books, stimulated education in the Himalayan region, fostered literacy across Tibetan society, improved the economy of Bodh Gaya, India, and enabled nuns—who were traditionally limited to non-scholastic activities—to study texts and earn advanced degrees.\n\nThe monastic tradition was and still is uniquely strong for Tibetans. In 1951, monasteries had access to and occupied between 37 and 50 percent of the best, most fertile land in Tibet. In addition, the government strongly supported the monasteries, providing money for prayer ceremonies and other religious activities. In the three largest monasteries around Lhasa, there alone were twenty thousand monks. Before the Chinese takeover, between 10 and 20 percent of males in Tibet were monks. This is a much higher percentage compared to other Buddhist countries. In Thailand, for example, only 1-2 percent of its males were monks in the mid-1900s. According to Melvyn C. Goldstein, the large number of monasteries was a result from the Tibetans' belief that \"Tibet's greatness lay in its development of a system wherein tens of thousands of young boys were constantly being taken away from the mundane world of inevitable suffering and thrust into a purer alternative culture—the organized community of celibate monks.\"\n\nWhen China invaded Tibet in 1959, thousands of these monasteries were destroyed along with their libraries, marking the beginning of a precarious time for Tibetans and their culture.\n\nIn 1959 with around 100,000 of his followers, the Dalai Lama fled from Chinese persecution. Prior to that Tarthang (Tar-tung) Tulku, a Tibetan lama, had traveled to study in Sikkim with his primary teacher, Khentse Rinpoche.\n\nLater settling in India on a scholastic fellowship, Tarthang Rinpoche spent six years teaching Buddhist philosophy at Sanskrit University in Benares. He also began a small Tibetan-language publishing company. After years of witnessing the decline of his culture and the living conditions of his fellow refugees, Tarthang traveled to California in 1968. In Berkeley—where there was already a flourishing array of East-meets-West, his desire to help the Tibetans and all humanity would have a place to grow. Later, he would establish Dharma Publishing and the Tibetan Aid Project.\n\nIn the 7th century, Buddhism came to Tibet from India. The religion thrived in the region and a steady flow of the Buddha's teachings were translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan. These texts were canonized as the Kanjur and the Tanjur. The Kanjur is the sacred teachings of the Buddha and the Tanjur, a large collection of commentary on the teachings.\n\nWith the desire to publish these Tibetan texts, Tarthang searched everywhere for the Kanjur and the Tanjur. However, there were very few copies to be found. Empty-handed, Tarthang spread the word to the Tibetan refugees, some of whom had carried books instead of food with them during the mass exodus of 1959. Many Tibetan refugees responded to Tarthang's search, and as a result, in 1982 Dharma Publishing was able to put together a complete canonical collection of the texts based on the Derge Edition and other editions, including nine texts from the Chinese Canon. Containing 5,109 texts and totaling 65,160 pages, the Canon also includes traditional Tibetan art and is the most complete collection of the Kanjur and Tanjur ever assembled.\n\nBesides the Kanjur and the Tanjur, Tarthang oversees the production of other sacred Tibetan texts written by numerous great teachers and philosophers, such as Dudjom Rinpoche, Jigme Lingpa and Patrul Rinpoche, to name a few.\n\nIn 1989, Tarthang organized an annual ceremony in order to pray for world peace at Bodh Gaya in Bihar, India—the site of Buddha's enlightenment. The Ceremony takes place in January and lasts for 10 days. During the World Peace Ceremony, the Tibetan Aid Project distributes thousands of books to Tibetans. Over the span of 22 years, TAP has helped give away more than three million books and sacred art prints and over 140,000 prayer wheels, preserving the Tibetan teachings of wisdom and compassion for generations to come.\n\nIn 2001, Chef Laurent Manrique proposed to the Tibetan Aid Project of doing a charity dinner to which he would invite some of his other chef friends to join in. Over the years, it has grown into the main fundraiser for the Tibetan Aid Project. During the event, over 20 of the Bay Area's best chefs work in pairs to prepare exquisite meals for 220 guests at the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco.\n\nIn addition to the Tibetan Aid Project, Tarthang established several other organizations to not only preserve Tibetan culture but to also benefit all humanity.\n\nThe Nyingma Institute was founded in 1972. It offers lectures, classes and retreats on Buddhist studies, meditation, yoga, Nyingma psychology and other classes. Since its beginning, over 150,000 students have attended the Nyingma Institute in Berkeley, California.\n\nThe Dharma Publishing Company was moved to the United States from India. It began its operations in 1971 with the goal to preserve Tibetan culture by keeping important books in print. Every year, Dharma Publishing publishes and distributes thousands of Tibetan texts around the world. It also publishes books by Tarthang Tulku., such as Time, Space and Knowledge, Gesture of Balance and Skillful Means.\n\nThe Mangalam Research Center for Buddhist Languages, founded in 2008, is the center where scholars come to study Buddhism, its written tradition and its sacred texts. In its library, it holds one of the world's greatest collections of Tibetan texts.\n\nDharma College is new and will eventually offer noontime and evening lectures for the community in addition to college and graduate-level classes for students of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe Yeshe De Text Program or the Tibetan Book Project preserves Tibetan texts for distribution.\n\nThe Guna Foundation began in 2009 in order to preserve archival pictures and footage of Tarthang Tulku and his organizations. The foundation currently finished the documentary Light of the Valley, which is about the 15th renovation of the Swayambhu Stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal. The foundation also funds Yak Liberation, a group that releases yaks back into the wild.\n\nThe Light of Buddhadharma Foundation raises funds to preserve and restore shrines and cultural artifacts in India, pay for religious ceremonies at holy places in India and buy robes for monks.\n\nOdiyan Retreat Center, located on 1,000 acres of land in a remote part of Northwestern Sonoma County, this retreat center was founded in 1975. At Odiyan, scholars and practitioners can immerse themselves in meditation and Nyingma training.\n\nThe Ratna Ling Retreat Center began in 2004 near Cazadero, California. Dharma Press was relocated to Ratna Ling shortly after the acquisition. As the new home to Dharma Presses, Ratna Ling is a retreat, education and spiritual center geared towards operating the presses by uncompensated retreatants.\n\n"}

Founded in 1886 by Pierre Lorillard IV, its facilities now include an 18-hole golf course, lawn tennis, court tennis, racquets, squash, platform tennis, olympic-sized pool, and boating. The tuxedo was introduced by New York millionaire James Potter at the club's first Autumn ball in 1886, after a trip to England.\n\nThe original clubhouse, designed by Bruce Price, was built in 1886 and demolished in 1927. John Russell Pope's clubhouse was constructed on the original stone foundations the following year. The clubhouse is U-shaped, with stucco over wood frame, low hipped slate roof, stone embedded in stucco, leaded glass casements, and mullions forming crosettes in continuous fenestration. Located at the foot of Tuxedo Lake, it commands a view to the other end of lake and two ranges of wooded hills. A lawn extends between the club house and the lake.\n\nTo the northwest of the clubhouse is the court tennis and racquet house, also on West Lake Road. Designed by architects Warren and Wetmore, it was built between 1890 and 1900. Made of Bickley cement and supported by stone and brick arches in the basement, these courts became a model for future courts built in the United States. They have full galleries for spectators. The original glass roof with canvasses has been replaced with artificial light.\n\nThe golf course does not sit near the main clubhouse facility. It is roughly away just outside the gates of the private community known as Tuxedo Park where the main club, tennis club and pool are located. The golf course is actually the third golf course of the club, as the first became the Blair estate and the second was overtaken by the New York State Thruway, forcing the move of the course to the new location near the Eagle Valley section of Tuxedo. The course existing today was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Sr. It is an 18-hole championship course.\n\n"}

A total of several hundred are estimated to live in Senegal; the national capital Dakar even boasts a few Vietnamese restaurants.\n\nBoth being former French colonies, Vietnam and Senegal have a long history of cultural links. Beginning in the 1930s, many Senegalese began serving in Vietnam as soldiers for France; some took local wives, with whom they had children. However, in the turbulent 1940s, with World War II and the First Indochina War, many Vietnamese women married to Senegalese followed their husbands back to Senegal. By 2007, Jean Gomis, himself a Vietnamese descendant and an unofficial \"community leader\", estimated that fewer than five of those wives remained alive, while 300 of their descendants lived scattered throughout Senegal. They retained some knowledge of the Vietnamese language and still cook Vietnamese cuisine; however, Gomis expected that within 10 years, the language would no longer be spoken.\n\nIn the 1990s, Vietnamese agricultural technicians began to arrive in Senegal under the sponsorship of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, through an initiative to promote cooperation between the nations of the global South. By 2001, their numbers had risen from 40 to 100. Most technicians come to Senegal on two year stints, unaccompanied by their spouses, and live in group housing with other Vietnamese. They aim to promote small-scale technologies and techniques suitable to Senegal's level of economic development; for example, Vietnamese beekeepers introduced Senegalese farmers to manually driven centrifugal honey extractors and Vietnamese-style concrete beehives. Others attempted to familiarise Senegalese people to the representative Vietnamese fish sauce \"nước mắm\". Though as of 2001, it was only produced and used by the restaurants in Dakar, Vietnamese technicians in the seaside town of M'Bour trained a women's group in its preparation, and produced roughly 20 tanks of the sauce. Most of the technicians speak only Vietnamese, though they typically learn some Wolof language agricultural vocabulary during their time in the country.\n\n"}
