This incessant action drew the attention of the armed guards who shot in the air to stop them. This effort was futile until the army officers came in to suppress the uprising. Twenty-one prisoners were killed by the military personnel and two government officials were seriously injured.\n\nAfter the attack, there was a controversy over the death of the 21 prisoners who died in the process of the attack, because some innocent prisoners might have been killed by the soldiers who labeled them as Boko haram.\nThis assumption was based on the \"New York Times\" publications of the Amnesty International report that alleges malicious killing of about 600 unarmed, rearrested escapees who had been earlier freed when Boko haram attacked the Giwa military barracks in Maiduguri.\nThe Amnesty International report was based on an eye-witness account of the Nigerian soldiers' killing of the innocent rearrested prisoners that was freed by Boko haram during the \"Giwa military barracks attack\". The eye-witness said: \"The former detainees were in a classroom. They started screaming ‘we are not Boko Haram. We are detainees!’ My neighbours and I saw the soldiers take the men to a place called ‘no man’s land,’ behind the University of Maiduguri. We watched as the soldiers opened fire killing all 56. They were killed in front of us. All of them”, according to the \"New York Times\".\n\n"}

In colloquial vernacular it usually refers to the genitals being depicted. This can be for realism or educational purposes, as well as to satisfy inanimate fetishism. A very detailed type of anatomically correct doll may be used in questioning children who may have been sexually abused. The use of dolls as interview aids has been criticized, and the validity of information obtained this way has been contested.\n\nSome children's baby dolls and potty training dolls are anatomically correct for educational purposes. There are also dolls that are used as medical models, particularly in explaining medical procedures to child patients. These have a more detailed depiction of the human anatomy and may include features like removable internal organs.\n\nSome fashion dolls intended for adult collectors, for example the Sybarite, and Madame Alexander dolls, have a level of anatomical correctness beyond that of fashion dolls like Barbie which are intended as children's playthings. Other dolls which are customized and enjoyed by adults are sometimes anatomically correct, like reborn baby dolls and Asian ball-jointed dolls.\n\nThe dolls are also sometimes used by parents or teachers as sex education.\n\nSex dolls are sometimes also referred to as anatomically correct.\n\nA particular type of anatomically correct dolls are used in law enforcement and therapy. These dolls have detailed depictions of all the primary and secondary sexual characteristics of a human: \"oral and anal openings, ears, tongues, nipples, and hands with individual fingers\" for all and a \"vagina, clitoris and breasts\" for each of the women and a \"penis and testicles\" for each of the men.\n\nThese dolls are used during interviews with children who may have been sexually abused. The dolls wear removable clothing, and the anatomically correct and similarly scaled body parts ensure that sexual activity can be simulated realistically.\n\nWhile there are supporters of the use of anatomically correct dolls in questioning victims of sexual abuse, there are also critics of this practice. Critics argue that because of the novelty of the dolls, children will act out sexually explicit maneuvers with the dolls even if the child has not been sexually abused. Another criticism is that because the studies that compare the differences between how abused and non-abused children play with these dolls are conflicting (some studies suggest that sexually abused children play with anatomically correct dolls in a more sexually explicit manner than non-abused children, while other studies suggest that there is no correlation), it is impossible to interpret what is meant by how a child plays with these dolls.\n"}

In Haiti, there are a sizable number of Haitians that are either of Middle-Eastern ancestry or who trace their origins to Arab descendants. Hadrami and Levantine Arabic ancestry can be found within the Arab Haitian community known in Arabic as \"Bilad al-Sham\", primarily Lebanon and Syria.\n\nThe first Arab immigrants to arrive in Haiti reached the shores of the Caribbean country during the middle to late 19th century. During the time, Haiti's business sector was dominated by German and Italian immigrants. Many of them migrated to the countryside where they peddled and were very informal economically speaking. World War I, which took place when Lebanon was part of the Germany-allied Ottoman Empire, triggered a Lebanese migration to the Americas, with Haiti receiving a large number of Lebanese immigrants. Haiti received a score of Palestinian refugees during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The country was estimated to have about 257,000 residents of Arab heritage, about 68% of them are mixed-race, mainly mixing with the Haitian mulatto elite.\n\nArab Haitians are commonly considered as part of the upper class within Haitian society, yet they maintain their own unique presence separate from the very influential and much larger mixed-race and white Haitian populace. For years, they were shunned by the elite mulatto Haitians because of amicable interaction with the poor masses, their willingness to do business with masses and their inability to speak French. This relationship changed gradually over the years as their prominence grew in Haiti's business sector and consequently, a large percentage of them reside and do business in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Middle-class Arab Haitians often are the owners of many of the city's supermarkets.\n\n\n\n"}

The focus is on accelerated evolution being aided by advanced species for less advanced species and societies.\n\nThe novels take place in the same future history, but do not relate a continuous storyline. Each book covers unrelated events, with the exception of \"Shikasta\" and \"The Sirian Experiments\", which tell the story of accelerated evolution on Earth through the eyes of Canopeans and Sirians respectively.\n\n\nThe five books have also appeared compiled in a single volume entitled \"Canopus in Argos: Archives\" (1992, ).\n\nWhen Lessing began writing \"Shikasta\" she intended it to be a \"single self-contained book\". But as her fictional universe developed, she found she had ideas for more than just one book, and ended up writing a series of five.\n\nThe \"Canopus in Argos\" series as a whole falls into categories of social or soft science fiction (\"space fiction\" in Lessing's own words) because of its focus on characterisation and social-cultural issues, and its lack of emphasis of the details of scientific technology. This set of writings represented a major shift of focus for Lessing, influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism, in particular by Idries Shah. She later wrote several essays on Sufism which were published in her essay collection, \"Time Bites\" (2004).\n\nThe \"Canopus in Argos\" was not well received by some reviewers and readers, who felt that Lessing had abandoned her \"rational worldview\". This prompted her to write in the Preface to the third book, \"The Sirian Experiments\":\n\nLater Lessing discovered that many younger people who had read the \"Canopus\" series were not interested in her other works. They told her, \"Oh, realism, I can't be bothered with that.\"\n\n\"The Making of the Representative for Planet 8\" and \"The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five\" were adapted for the opera by composer Philip Glass with librettos written by Lessing.\n\n\n"}

The term continues in the media in all senses. It is sometimes used positively for celebrated legal cases for their precedent value (each locus classicus or \"case-in-point\") and more often negatively for infamous ones, whether for scale, outrage, scandal or conspiracy theories.\n\nThe term is a French phrase in common usage in English. Since it has been fully adopted into English and is included unitalicized in English dictionaries, it is not normally italicized despite its French origin.\n\nIn French, \"cause\" means, here, a legal case, and \"célèbre\" means \"famous\". The phrase originated with the 37-volume \"Nouvelles Causes Célèbres\", published in 1763, which was a collection of reports of well-known French court decisions from the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWhile English speakers had used the phrase for many years, it came into much more common usage after the 1894 conviction of Alfred Dreyfus for espionage during the cementing of a period of deep cultural ties with a political tie between England and France, the Entente Cordiale. Both attracted worldwide interest and the period of closeness or \"rapprochement\" officially broadened the English language.\n\nIt has been noted that the public attention given to a particular case or event can obscure the facts rather than clarify them.

Most Chagossians now live in Mauritius and the United Kingdom after being forcibly evicted by the British government in the late 1960s and early 1970s so that Diego Garcia, the island where most Chagossians lived, could serve as the location for a United States military base. Today, no Chagossians live on the island of Diego Garcia, as it is now the site of the military base Camp Justice.\n\nThe Chagossian people's ancestry is mostly African, particularly from Madagascar, Mozambique and other African nations including Mauritius. There is also a significant proportion of Indian and Malay ancestry. The French brought some to the Chagos islands as slaves from Mauritius in 1786. Others arrived as fishermen, farmers, and coconut plantation workers during the 19th century.\n\nThe Chagossians speak Chagossian Creole, a French-based creole language whose vocabulary also incorporates words originating in various African and Asian languages and is part of the Bourbonnais Creole family. Chagossian Creole is still spoken by some of their descendants in Mauritius and the Seychelles. Chagossian people living in the UK speak English. Many settled in the town of Crawley in West Sussex, and the Chagossian community there numbered approximately 3,000 in 2016.\n\nIn 2016, the British government denied the right of the Chagossians to return to the islands after a 45-year legal dispute.\n\nIn 1793, when the first successful colony was founded on Diego Garcia, coconut plantations were established on many of the atolls and isolated islands of the archipelago. Initially the workers were enslaved Africans, but after 1840 they were freemen, many of whom were descended from those earlier enslaved. They formed an inter-island culture called \"Ilois\" (a French Creole word meaning Islanders).\n\nIn 1965, as part of a deal to grant Mauritian independence, the Chagos Archipelago was split off from the Colony and came to form the British Indian Ocean Territory. The territory's new constitution was set out in a statutory instrument imposed unilaterally without any referendum or consultation with the Chagossians and it envisaged no democratic institutions. On 16 April 1971, the United Kingdom issued a policy called BIOT Immigration Ordinance #1 which made it a criminal offense for those without military clearance to be on the islands without a permit.\nBetween 1967 and 1973, the Chagossians, then numbering over 1,000 people, were expelled by the British government, first to the island of Peros Banhos, away from their homeland, and then, in 1973, to Mauritius (for the relationship between the Chagos Archipelago and Mauritius, see Chagos Archipelago). A number of Chagossians who were evicted reported they were threatened with being shot or bombed if they did not leave the island. One old man reported to \"Washington Post\" journalist David Ottaway that an American official told him, \"If you don't leave you won't be fed any longer.\" BIOT commissioner Bruce Greatbatch later ordered all dogs/pets on the island to be destroyed. Meanwhile, food stores on the island were allowed to deplete in order to pressure the remaining inhabitants to leave. The Chagossians owned no real property on the islands and lived in housing provided for farm workers by the absentee landowners of the plantations. The forced expulsion of the Chagossians after the acquisition of the plantations from their absentee landlords by the British Government was for the purpose of establishing a United States air and naval base on Diego Garcia, with a population of between 3,000 and 5,000 U.S. soldiers and support staff, as well as a few troops from the United Kingdom.\nIn early April 2006, in an excursion organised and financed by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, a group of around a hundred Chagossians were permitted to visit the British Indian Ocean Territory for the first time in over thirty years.\n\nIn April 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected a lawsuit by Louis Olivier Bancoult and other Chagossians, finding that their claims were a non-justiciable political question, i.e. a question that U.S. courts cannot handle because it is properly the business of the Congress to address it legislatively.\n\nOn 11 May 2006, the Chagossians won their case in the High Court of Justice in England, which found that they were entitled to return to the Chagos Archipelago. It remained to be seen how this judgment might be implemented in practice. However, in June 2006 the British government filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal against the High Court's decision. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office put forward an argument based on the treatment of the Japanese Canadians following the attacks on Pearl Harbor.\n\nAfter the Court of Appeal had upheld the decision of the High Court, the British government appealed successfully to the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords. On 22 October 2008, the Law Lords reached a decision on the appeal made by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband. They found in favour of the Government in a 3–2 verdict, ending the legal process in the UK and dashing the islanders' hopes of return. The judges who voted to allow the government's appeal were Lord Hoffmann, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, and Lord Carswell; those dissenting were Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Mance.\n\nIn 2016, the British government denied the right of the Chagossians to return to the islands after a 45-year legal dispute.\n\nIn April 2010, the British Government—specifically, the British diplomat Colin Roberts, acting on the instructions of David Miliband—established a marine nature reserve around the Chagos Islands known as the Chagos Marine Protected Area. The designation proved controversial as the decision was announced during a period when the UK Parliament was in recess.\n\nOn 1 December 2010, a leaked US Embassy London diplomatic cable dating back to 2009 exposed British and US calculations in creating the marine nature reserve. The cable relays exchanges between US Political Counselor Richard Mills and British Director of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Colin Roberts, in which Roberts \"asserted that establishing a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents\". Richard Mills concludes:\n\nThe cable (reference ID \"09LONDON1156\") was classified as confidential and \"no foreigners\", and leaked as part of the Cablegate cache.\n\nArmed with the Wikileaks revelations, the Chagossians launched an appeal, seeking a judgement that the reserve was unlawfully aimed at preventing them returning home. Although United States Army soldier Chelsea Manning had been arrested nearly three years previously for the leaks, the UK government felt unable to confirm to the court that the leaked documents were genuine. It was made clear to the court that the government's inability to confirm was for two reasons: firstly, to protect itself from the charge that it created the reserve to prevent the islanders from ever returning home and, secondly, out of a purported fear that the US government might get angry if the cables were acknowledged as genuine. Despite the contents of his cable being known—\"a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents\"—Roberts denied, when questioned in court, that there was an \"ulterior motive\" behind the reserve's establishment. Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Mitting then refused to accept the documents as evidence, declaring that to do so would breach diplomatic privilege. The \"Guardian\" described their decision as having \"far-reaching consequences\" and \"a severe setback for the use of material obtained from leaks or whistleblowers\". In June 2013, the pair of judges turned down the appeal brought by the Chagossians, ruling that everything was fine because the reserve was compatible with EU law.\n\nIt emerged in 2014 that—for three decades, in violation of environmental rules—the American navy had dumped hundreds of tonnes of sewage and waste water into a protected lagoon on Diego Garcia. In response to the revelations, the chair of the Chagos Refugees Group UK Branch, Sabrina Jean, noted:\n\nThe WikiLeaks cables revealed diplomatic cables between the US and UK about the Chagossians.\nA cable written by D.A. Greenhill on 24 August 1966 to a US State Department official refers to the Chagossians as \"some few Tarzans or Man Fridays\".\n\nSimilar language appears in a 2009 US State Department cable (09LONDON1156), which offered a description of the UK government's views about the effect of the Marine Protection Act:\nOn 5 March 2012, a petition was launched on We the People section of the whitehouse.gov website in order to ask the White House in the United States to consider the Chagos case.\n\nThe petition read as follows:\n\nOn 4 April 2012, the sufficient number of 25,000 signatures was met to require a response from the Office of the President under its then-current policy. An undated response was posted on the White House petition web site by the United States Department of State, in the name of Michael Posner (Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor), Philip Gordon (Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs) and Andrew J. Shapiro (Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs). The response read as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

The country is one of the most known cases in terms of impacts of Climate Change. Factors such as frequent natural disasters, lack of infrastructure, high population density (166 million people living in an area of 147 000 km2 ), an extractivist economy and social disparities are increasing the vulnerability of the country in facing the current changing conditions. There, in almost every year, large regions suffer from more intense events like cyclones, floods and erosion. The mentioned adverse events are slowing the development of the country by bringing almost to collapse socio-economical and environmental systems.\n\nClimate Change adaptation plays a crucial role in fostering the country´s development. This is already being considered as a synergic urgent action together with other pressing factors such as the permanent threat of shocks – natural, economic or political- the uncertain impact of globalization, and an imbalanced world trade impede higher growth rates.\n\nFrom a prehistoric age, Bangladesh has faced numerous natural disasters in every decade but due to climate change, the intensity of disasters has been increased. The country experiences small to medium scale floods, cyclones, flash floods, and landslides in almost every year. Between 1980 and 2008, it experienced 219 natural disasters. Flood is the most common form of disaster in Bangladesh. The country was affected by six major floods in the 19th century and 18 floods in the 20th century. Among them, 1987, 1985 and 1998 were the most catastrophic. Major cyclones occurred in the 20th centuries were in 1960, 1961, 1963, 1970, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1991, 1995. The cyclone in 1991 killed an estimated 140,000 people and 10 million people lost their homes. In recent past, the country faced 2 major cyclones in 2007 and 2009.\n\nThe IPCC defines adaptation as the \"adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities\". From this main definition, three types of adaptation are distinguished:\n\n\nTransformative adaptation aims to address the roots of vulnerability through action “that changes the fundamental attributes of a system in response to climate and its effects”. It highlights the relevance of governance, social capital, and adaptation policies in creating inequality, and states that adaptation is a long term process where concepts of subjectivity, knowledge and authority result in greater efforts to create a more just society.\n\nFrom a socio-political understanding is a process that mediates how people and collectives cope with multiple and persistent environmental and social changes. This reframing of adpatation derives in four propositions:\n\n\nThe geographic location of Bangladesh makes it highly prone to natural disasters. Situated in between the intersection of Himalayan mountains in the North and the Bay of Bengal in the South, the country experiences 2 completely different environmental conditions leading long monsoons and catastrophic natural disasters. With the new phenomenons like climate change and sea level rising, the situation is getting even worst. The country is also very low and flat, having only 10% land above 1 meter high of the sea level. Bangladesh frequently experiences gigantic cyclones and floods, being criss-crossed by hundreds of rivers and one of the largest river systems in the whole world, (the estuarial region of Padma, Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers) .\n\nBangladesh is also one of the most populated countries in the world and the high population density of the country makes it vulnerable to any kind of natural disasters. In recent past, the country has shown remarkable success of poverty reduction yet 24% people live under poverty line. Moreover, the country is experiencing a rapid and unplanned urbanisation without ensuring the adequate infrastructure and basic social services. The unsustainable process of urbanisation makes the city dweller vulnerable to climate change as well.\n\nBangladesh is one of the countries that contributes the less to greenhouse emissions, yet has one of the highest vulnerability conditions to global warming, prone to a significant number of climate related disasters. There are serious consequences from the impacts of climate change on different sectors of the economy in the country, mainly but not exclusively concentrated in the agriculture sector. \nSince 2010, donors have invested more than USD 170 million with the aim of adapting infrastructure, improving the governance and improving the resilience of the ecosystems. However, when running a detailed analysis, the poverty, inequity and environmental injustices are even higher.\n\nBesides the consequences from the impacts of Climate Change, the whole country is yet affected by the results of maladaptation processes. Most of the aid and efforts put in alleviating the systems from vulnerability factors, have being object of bad management resulting in accentuating ethnic hierarchies in some communities, trapping the poor, powerless and displaced in a patronage system, leading to increased human insecurity and intensified violent conflict.\n\nClimate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction may seem two different fields but however both are similar in their objectives which is to build resilience in the face of hazards. The relation between the two field in one study is explained as ‘Climate change adaptation requires the re-shaping and re-designing of development, social and economic practices to respond effectively to new or anticipated environmental changes. Likewise Disaster Risk Reduction seeks to influence development decision-making and protect development aspirations from environment related risks. The effectiveness of both adaptation and DRR are limited if they are not viewed within the broader context of sustainable development.\n\nBangladesh has shown important results on disaster risk mitigation and is in fact, one of the world leaders in disaster management. It has been made possible as the country changed its disaster programs from prevention to risk reduction. The deaths and damages by natural catastrophes has been drastically reduced in comparison to 1970. Once highly dependent on international aid for providing relief to the affected communities through ad-hoc relief supports, the country soon realized the importance of establishing a culture of resilience to mitigate the risk occurred from the catastrophes.\n\nWith a mission ‘to achieve a paradigm shift in disaster management from conventional response and relief to a more comprehensive risk reduction culture, and to promote food security as an important factor in ensuring the resilience of communities to hazards’ the government of Bangladesh in collaboration with multilateral partners and civil society organizations working on a direction to achieve 3 goals which are i. Saving lives, ii. Protecting investments iii. Effective recovery and building.\n\nOne of the major successes of Bangladesh on adaptation of climate change is a strong institutional setup. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) has a wide range of programs on DRR. It has recently drafted a ‘National Plan for Disaster Management (2016-2020)’ with a detail institutional framework on disaster management. According to the NPDM, disaster management policy and activities is guided by several drivers including, ‘a) Disaster Management Act 2012; b) Standing Orders on Disasters (SOD) first introduced in 1997 and then revised in 2010; (SOD) first introduced in 1997 and then revised in 2010; c) National Plan for Disaster Management 2010-2015; d) Disaster Policy Act 2015; e) SAARC Framework for Action (SFA) 2006-2015; f) Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 2016-2030; g) Asian Regional Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction (ARPDRR); and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nBangladesh is also supported by different international organizations such as United Nations, World Bank, and so on. With help from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Bangladesh developed a flood action plan initiating a culture of disaster management and risk reduction. UNDP also supported Bangladesh to establish the Disaster Management Bureau. Bangladesh also has a large network of NGOs all through the country who are highly active in supporting the people vulnerable from climate change.\n\nBeing an agrarian society, people of Bangladesh are greatly dependent on various forms of agriculture. It is the main source of rural job in the country having over 87% people somewhat related to agri-based economy. In 2016, according to World Bank, agriculture contributed to 14.77% of country’s GDP. A steady increase in agricultural production with the use of modern equipment and scientific methods, agriculture has been a key driver to eradicate rural poverty in Bangladesh. The risk of sea level rising and global warming is the biggest challenge not only to country’s agricultural improvement but also the success on poverty reduction.\n\nAs agricultural production is heavily related with temperature and rainfall, the current change in weather conditions is creating negative impact on crop yielding and the total area of arable land has been decreased. According to a report published by the Ministry of Environment and Forests - GoB, 1 degree Celsius increase in maximum temperature at vegetative, reproductive and ripening stages there was a decrease in Aman rice production by 2.94, 53.06 and 17.28 tons respectively. Another major threat deriving from this factor is water salinity which directly affects rice production especially in the coastal part of Bangladesh. The same report state that, the country will lose 12-16% of its land if the sea level rises by 1 meter. These challenges lead to food scarcity and insecurity for the huge populace of the country. There are several adaptation measures which are practised to cope up with the abnormal behaviour of climate such as: resilient varieties of crops, diversification, change in cropping pattern, mixed cropping, improved irrigation facility, adopting soil conservation, agroforestry and so on. A number of these measures have already been adapted by the government of Bangladesh and well practised throughout the country. The Bangladesh Rice Research Institute has introduced a varieties of saline tolerant rices like BR-11, BR-23, BRRI rice -28, BRRI rice -41, BRRI rice -47, BRRI rice -53 and BRRI rice -54. In the drought prone areas, BR-11, BR-23, BRRI rice -28, BRRI rice -41, BRRI rice -47, BRRI rice -53 and BRRI rice -54 are used which take short time to cultivate. To make the best and efficient utilization of water the Department of Agricultural Extension has introduced ‘Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). The government also provide financial support to the affected farmers from different disasters and hazards\n\nThe Bangladesh National Adaptation Programme Action - NAPA in its action plan have collected, structured and ranked a series of climate adaptation needs and vulnerabilities, as well as sector-specific costs and benefits. These proposed actions have considered poverty reduction and security of livelihoods with a gender perspective as the most important set of criteria for prioritization of adaptation needs and activities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1517290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1517290", "title": "Consider Her Ways", "text": "Consider Her Ways\n\nConsider Her Ways is a 1956 science fiction novella by John Wyndham. It was published as part of a 1961 collection with some short stories called \"Consider Her Ways and Others\" (where it forms over a third of the book). The title is from Proverbs, Chapter 6, verse 6: \"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise\".\n\nThe story is mostly a first-person narrative. It begins with a woman (Jane Waterleigh) who has no memory of her past waking up and discovering that she is a mother of some description, in a bloated body that is not her own. After some confusing experiences Jane's memory gradually returns and she recalls that she was part of an experiment using a drug (chuinjuatin) to see if it enabled people to have out-of-body experiences. It seems that the drug has worked far better than anyone could have anticipated: Jane has been cast into the future. She also realises that she is in a society consisting entirely of women, organised into a strict system of castes, and that she is now a member of the mother caste. Jane's initial contacts have never even heard of men, and believe her to be delusional.\n\nWhen it becomes clear to doctors who attend Jane that something strange has happened (since she can read and write, while the mother caste are illiterate) they arrange for her to be taken to meet an aged historian named Laura. It seems that Jane is in a society somewhat more than a century after her own time. Laura relates that not long after Jane's own time a Dr Perrigan carried out scientific experiments that unintentionally created a virus that killed all the men in the world, leaving only women. After a very difficult period of famine and breakdown, a small number of educated women, found mainly in the medical profession, took control and embarked on an urgent programme of research to enable women to reproduce without males. The women also decided to follow some advice from the Bible (\"Go to the ant thou sluggard, consider her ways\") and created a caste-based society in which Jane has become a member of the Mother caste.\n\nLaura does understand what Jane means when she talks of men. However, she is certain that they were oppressors of women and that the world is far better without them. Jane disagrees and feels the demise of men to be a terrible blow.\n\nDistressed at the prospect of spending her life as a bloated producer of babies, expected to be unable to read, write or reason, Jane requests that she be administered a dose of chuinjuatin in the hope that she might return to her own time. It works, and once transported, Jane decides to stop Dr Perrigan at all costs. The story has an ambiguous ending, which may suggest that it is the narrator's own actions that will lead to the catastrophe she hopes to prevent, an example of the predestination paradox.\n\n\n\"Consider Her Ways\" was an episode of \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\" in 1964. This was a fairly faithful adaptation of Wyndham's story, although somewhat condensed and with the action moved to America. The screenplay was written by Oscar Millard, and it starred Barbara Barrie as the woman who travels through time and Gladys Cooper as the historian.\n\n"}

The area was controlled by Britain until 1860, and eventually integrated into Nicaragua by 1894. The Miskito Coast region divided into two autonomous regions within Nicaragua after 1987.\n\nThe first English settlers of the Miskito Coast arrived in 1633, exchanging products through primitive trade with the Miskitos. The English exchanged manufactured goods such as guns, machetes, beds, mirrors etc., in exchange for cocoa, animal skins, sarsaparilla, rubber, wood, and turtle shells. The formation of an English colony in the region led Spain to protest, but England managed to create a colony on the Caribbean Coast. This colony had two different, but complementary, production methods; one a capitalist basis and the other communal. Capitalist production was based on the import of African slaves to work on sugar cane and cotton plantations, and the harvesting of Mahogany. Arguably, the English were responsible for transporting most of the African slaves that were forcibly resettled in Nicaragua. The obtained products were sold to other English colonies in North America, the Caribbean and London.\n\nCommunal production, typical of the area and strengthened by new settlers, was based on the appointment of a Miskito King. The first such King, Oldman, was appointed during the English Interregnum and continued during the reign of Charles II of England and Scotland and after the Acts of Union between England and Scotland. In 1847, the British occupied the Nicaraguan side of the Miskito Coast.\n\nIn 1860 Britain and the United States signed a treaty following the development of international negotiations between the two countries. As a result, from 1894 the UK gradually ceded its territories in the region and in 1905 handed the territory to US companies. The latter occupation lasted until 1930.\n\nAfter British withdrawal, the Miskito coast remained an autonomous region of Nicaragua for 44 years. It maintained its own laws and regulations until 1894, when the region was integrated into Nicaragua by President José Santos Zelaya. This developed monopolies for mestizos in the area and for US interests, and the name of the region was changed to the Department of Zelaya.\n\nThe government encouraged massive immigration of Nicaraguan mestizos, especially those engaged in military and commercial affairs, and entrepreneurs. Immigrants and Nicaraguan government officials evicted the indigenous Amerindians and Afro-descendants from their lands and imposed heavy fines on the indigenous groups living on the coast. In addition, the government abolished the region's laws by force and replaced them with Nicaraguan institutions, including the state's education, legal and governance structures.\n\nThe most important result was the prohibition of education in English and other indigenous languages such as that spoken by the Garifuna. The result was the abandonment of schools and colleges by the indigenous communities of the Miskito coast for generations. Additionally, the Nicaraguan coast remained economically dominated by US companies until the 1930s when they were gradually replaced by the capital of the Somoza family and its allies until 1979 with the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution.\n\nIn 1987 the Miskito Coast achieved autonomy from Nicaragua. In order to maintain the country's territorial integrity, the government divided the territory into two autonomous regions now known as the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region and the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region, but internal conflicts remain.\n"}

A significant increase in the severity of such conflicts between the various ethnic groups inhabiting the country was witnessed after the introduction of multi-party politics in the early 1990s, especially during the 2007–08 Kenyan crisis. Major conflicts have also led to exoduses of ethnic minority communities with roots in other geographical areas.\n\nSeveral factors have been identified as the source of outbreaks of communal violence among populations living in close proximity to each other. These include:\n\nThe most significant conflict witnessed since Kenya's independence from Britain was the 2007–08 Kenyan crisis, a series of inter-ethnic clashes ignited by the 2007 disputed presidential elections.\n\nBy the beginning of 2008, an estimated one third of the 2,200 member Indian community in Kisumu, which controlled most of the city's trade, had begun repatriating back home in the wake of the ethnic clashes. According to community representative Yogesh Dawda, the resident Indians did not trust the Kenyan police's ability to ensure their security.\n\nIn 1992, 5,000 people were killed and another 75,000 displaced in the Rift Valley Province, with the town of Molo being an epicenter of the violence. The conflict was primarily between the Kalenjin and Kikuyu communities with Land ownership cited as one of key reasons for the conflict.\n\nIn 2012, clashes over cattle between the ethnic groups in Samburu District resulted in the deaths of over 40 people including police officers sent to quell the violence.\n\nIn March 2017, 13 people were killed and four wounded in Baringo County during a series of cattle rustling.\n\nThe year 2005 witnessed an insurgency in the Mount Elgon District of the Western province of Kenya. This was led by the Sabaot Land Defence Force which drew its members from the Sabaot people, who are a sub-tribe of the Kalenjin.\n\n1997 saw a spate of clashes in the Likoni division of Mombasa District.\n\nIn 2012–2013, there was ethnic violence among the Orma and Pokomo group in the Tana River District who have historically fought over grazing, farmland and water.\n\nOn 18 November 2012, 10 people were killed and 25 seriously injured when an explosive ripped apart a route 28 mass transit mini-bus (matatu) in Eastleigh. The explosion was believed to have been an improvised explosive device or bomb of some sort. Looting and destruction of Somali-owned homes and shops by angry mobs of young Kenyans ensued. Somalis defended their property, and interpreted the bus explosion as a pretext for non-Somalis to steal from their community.\n\nOn 20 November 2012, Kenya Defence Forces swooped Garissa in a military operation. KDF soldiers subsequently burned down the local market and shot at a crowd of protesters, killing a woman and injuring 10 people. Another 35 residents were also receiving treatment at the provincial hospital after being assaulted by the soldiers, including a chief and two pupils. A group of MPs led by Farah Maalim accused Kenyan officers of fomenting violence, raping women and shooting at students, and threatened to take the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if the perpetrators were not brought to justice. \n\nMaalim also suggested that the deployment of the soldiers was unconstitutional and had not received the requisite parliamentary approval, and that the ensuing rampage cost Garissa entrepreneurs over Sh1.5 billion to Sh2billion in missed revenue. Additionally, Sheikhs with the CPK threatened to sue the military commanders for crimes against humanity committed during the operation. However, general harassment of the Somali community by Kenyan policemen continued, with some officers going as far as invading the homes of Somali businesspeople to steal precious jewellery, foreign currencies, and electronic devices, including expensive phones, laptops and other personal accessories.\n\nBy January 2013, a mass exodus of Somali residents was reported. Hundreds of Somali entrepreneurs withdrew between Sh10 to Sh40 billion from their Eastleigh bank accounts, with the intention of reinvesting most of that money back home in Somalia. The collective departures most affected Eastleigh's real estate sector, as landlords struggled to find Kenyans able to afford the high rates of the apartments and shops vacated by the Somalis.\n\n"}

{"id": "44113543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44113543", "title": "Immigration to Denmark", "text": "Immigration to Denmark\n\nDenmark has seen a steady increase in immigration over the past thirty years, with the majority of new immigrants originating from non-Western countries. As of 2014, more than 8% of the population of Denmark consists of immigrants. The population of immigrants is approximately 476,059, excluding Danish born descendants of immigrants to Denmark. This recent shift in demographics has posed challenges to the nation as it attempts to address religious and cultural difference, employment gaps, education of both immigrants and their descendants, spatial segregation, crime rates, and language abilities.\n\nPrior to World War I, Denmark experienced a mass emigration to non-European nations. During World War I, the period that followed, and World War II international emigration from and immigration to Denmark halted. Immigration to Denmark increased rapidly during the 1960s as the manufacturing economy expanded and the demand for labor increased. As a result of the increased demand, a majority of immigrants that came to Denmark during the 1960s and early 1970s were migrant laborers with guest worker status. A large proportion of the guest worker population came from Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Pakistan.\n\nAt the end of the 1960s immigration policy became more stringent, greatly reducing the number of immigrants arriving in Denmark. Immigration was limited further in the early 1970s in response to the first oil crises and the resulting consequences for the Danish economy. In 1972 and 1973, Denmark's immigration policy only allowed for migration of workers from within the Nordic region. After 1973 this policy was expanded to also permit labor migration from Europe. Despite these limitations on immigration, the 1972 policy granted guest workers residing in Denmark the option of applying for family reunification which then became the primary method of immigration from non-European countries to Denmark.\n\nThe granting of political asylum in conjunction with the Geneva Conventions greatly impacted immigration to Denmark from the 1980s onward. Although immigrants arriving as a result of family reunification continued to comprise a large portion of new immigrant populations, the number of refugees increased exponentially. In the 1990s, refugees made up a majority of inflow of immigrants. The Enlargement of the European Union in 2004 led to a second wave of labor immigration since its halt in the 1970s as Central and Eastern European countries gained access to the opportunity of free movement that EU membership guarantees.\n\nAccording to a 2012 report published by the Danish Immigration Service, the most common reason for receiving a Danish residence permit were:\n\nIn 2016, an interview with Queen Margrethe II of Denmark in the book \"De dybeste rødder\" (en: The Deepest Roots) she showed, according to historians at Saxo institutet, a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. Further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.\n\nIn October 2017, the Danish Immigration Service rejected over 600 asylum applications because the applicants had lied about their identitiy in order to achieve preferential treatment.\n\nDozens of cases of girls living with older men were identified in asylum centres in Denmark in February 2016, Reuters reported in April 2016. Minister Inger Støjberg stated she planned to \"stop housing child brides in asylum centres\". Furthermore, a spokeswoman for the ministry indicated \"There will never be exceptions in cases where one side is below the age of 15.\"\n\nSince 1980, the number of Danes has remained constant at around 5 million in Denmark and nearly all the population growth from 5.1 up to the 2018 total of 5.8 million was due to immigration.\n\nThe ten most represented countries of origin within the Danish immigrant population in order of greatest proportion of the population are Poland, Turkey, Germany, Iraq, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, Norway, Iran, Sweden, and Pakistan. According to Statistics Denmark, in the year 2014 immigrants from western countries of origin made up 41.88% of the population, whereas 58.12% of immigrants had non-western countries of origin. Statistics Denmark defines European Union member countries, Iceland, Norway, Andorra,\nLiechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland, the Vatican State, Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand as Western Countries and all other countries as Non-Western Countries. Refugees to Denmark are primarily Iraqis, Palestinians, Bosnians, Iranians, and Somalis. The population of non-western immigrants in 2008 was more than three times the number in the 1970s when family reunification was first introduced. A majority of reunified family members have been spouses and children of Danish or Nordic citizens, with only 2,000 of the 13,000 individuals reunited in 2002 coming from third world and refugee families.\n\nImmigrants from specific countries are divided into several ethnic groups. For example, there are both Russians and Chechens from Russia, Turks and Kurds from Turkey, Serbs and Albanians from Serbia and immigrants from Iran are divided into Persians, Azeris and Kurds.\nDanish law does not allow the registration of citizens based upon their religion, which makes religious demographic data of both Danish born and foreign born residents difficult to come by. According to the U.S. Department of State, Islam is the second largest religion in Denmark, with Muslims comprising 4% of the population. The U.S. Department of State attributes the size of this population to increased immigration to Denmark in their 2010 report, but does not elaborate on the number of Danes and foreign born populations adhering to each faith. A 2007 study of religious pluralism in Denmark describes the 0.7% of the population practicing Hinduism as being primarily Tamil immigrants from Sri Lanka and Northern India. The same study notes that a majority of Buddhists in Denmark are immigrants from Vietnam, Thailand, and Tibet, however the population of practicing Buddhists also includes a number of native Danes and immigrants from other Western Countries.\n\nAlthough religious demographics of immigrants to Denmark remain unclear, the perceived religious differences between immigrants and native Danes are a central theme in the political immigration debate. Negative public attitudes toward immigration in Denmark have been linked with negative views of Islam and its perceived incompatibility with Danish Protestant ethics and democratic values. Indeed, the former Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has been quoted, urging immigrants to Denmark to \"not put the Qur’an above the Constitution\" following the events of 9/11 in 2001, noting a perceived disconnection between Islamic ideals and the Danish democratic state.\n\nImmigrants from non-OECD countries of origin have also been found to have employment rates of 13 percentage points or more below that of immigrants from OECD countries. In a 2009 report by the Ministry of Refugee, Immigration, and Integration Affairs reported that from 2001 to 2008 there was a rise from 51.6% to 60.7% labor market participation by working age immigrants from non-western countries and the gap between labor market participation of non-western immigrants and those of Danish origin dropped by more than 9 percentage points. Despite reported gains, immigrant labor market participation remains far below that of Danes, which was above 80% in 2008.\n\nThe sectors that employ immigrants contrast with those that employ native Danes, with a higher proportion of immigrants concentrated in the field of manufacturing and a greater proportion of working immigrants, especially those from non-western countries of origin, being self-employed. Immigrant self-employment is concentrated in service sectors such as restaurants, hotels, retail, and repair services. Immigrants are also more likely to be employed in larger companies with 100 employees or more as opposed to mid-sized and small companies. A gap in employment continues to be found between highly skilled immigrants and Danes, with more than one fifth of highly educated immigrants working in jobs below their skill level, indicating that there may be more factors than the employment disincentive of welfare benefits to account for this pattern.\n\nOne explanation for this gap in employment between immigrant populations and Danes has been the high proportion of immigrants with low levels of education which correlate with lower wages. Studies have found that the difference in income and social benefits would only be marginally different for more than one third of the immigrant population, which makes immigrants vulnerable to the \"unemployment trap.\" Denmark offers some of the highest unemployment benefits of OECD countries, which have been argued to act as a disincentive for labor market participation, particularly within low skilled immigrant populations. One analysis by the Rockwool Foundation based on surveys of immigrants in 1999 and 2001 found that 36% of non-western immigrants and their descendants employed full-time earned 500 Danish Kroner in disposable income per month below what they would receive had they been full-time unemployed. The study found that wages above the benefits of unemployment not only incentivized workers to maintain their employment, but was also linked to immigrants’ job search activity, with immigrants with the greatest perspective income gains through employment being the most active in searching for and applying for jobs.\n\nAnother explanation relates to the structure of the Danish labor market, which consists primarily of highly skilled jobs with firm-specific training and few low skill or entry level positions. In addition, many entry level jobs require vocational training which most immigrants lack. Denmark's labor market is also characterized as flexible, with high levels of employee turn over. Immigrants' lack of language skills and cultural knowledge have been argued to be linked to their shorter periods of employment and lengthier dependency on unemployment benefits. The length of time an immigrant has lived in Denmark, their Danish language skills, and their associations with native Danes have been identified as being positively linked to immigrant employment. The connection between the gender of immigrants and these as well as additional factors, such as parenthood, and the level of Danish language skills, and the importance of education and employment qualifications differ among male and female immigrants. One study found that men’s language skills and qualifications were of less importance than for women immigrants applying for jobs. It was also found that immigrant women with small children were less likely to be employed than those without.\n\nIn addition to these theories, employment discrimination against immigrants has been identified as a possible barrier to workforce participation. A 2001 Rockwool Foundation study based on opinion surveys asked immigrants, second generation immigrants, and native Danes if they had been turned down from a job in the last five years and if they believed that they had been discriminated against. 35 percent of immigrant and immigrant descendant respondents had been turned down for a job and felt they had been discriminated against on the basis of ethnicity. Furthermore, 39% of immigrants and immigrant descendants employed at the time of the survey felt that they had been victims of discrimination at some time since entering the workforce.\n\nPreventing spatial segregation and ethnic enclaves has been a growing concern in Denmark since the 1980s. Denmark's first dispersal act was passed in 1986 and enforced the geographic dispersal of arriving refugee populations across the 13 Danish counties. The Integration Act of 1998 reassigned primary responsibility to find local housing for refugees and organize programs to introduce refugees to Danish society to municipalities. The 1998 legislation also tied immigrant introductory programs and welfare benefits to residing in their assigned municipality in order to discourage relocation.\nLegislation to further promote integration of immigrant populations, titled \"A Change for Everyone\" was passed in May 2005. Part of the aim of this legislation was to combat ethnic ghettoization of neighborhoods. This act gave municipalities the right to deny housing to applicants on housing waiting lists that had received public benefits for 6 months or more in order to encourage unemployed immigrant populations to accept housing offers outside of areas with high concentrations of immigrants in an effort to diversify the composition of tenants in urban areas. This legislation aimed to balance housing waiting lists in cities such as Copenhagen with existing vacancies in geographic regions such as Jutland.\n\nThe Danish Ghetto Policy has become a major topic of political discussion since 2002. A publication by the Danish Housing Sector describes considerations of government policies concerning ghettos in saying:\n\nAs of June 2013, residential areas are legally considered ghettos if residents of the area's income is 55% or below the region's income average, 50% of residents between the ages of 30 and 59 have not been educated past primary school, 2.7% of residents have been convicted of a crime, more than 50% of residents have non-western countries of origin, and 40% of adults between the ages of 18 and 64 are not working or in school. Classifying residential areas as ghettos is part of an effort to better pinpoint areas in need of social services to improve residents' quality of life. Currently 34 residential areas nationwide qualify as ghettos, with 6 of these residential areas located within the city of Copenhagen.\n\nIn 2018, the Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet published a proposal titled \"Ét Danmark uden parallelsamfund - Ingen ghettoer i 2030\" (\"One Denmark without parallel societies - No ghettoes by 2030\"). Examples of specific proposals are demolishment of existing neighbourhoods, requiring daycare institutions to accept at most 30% of children from ghettoes, and allowing police to designate areas as \"skærpede strafzoner\", in which the punishment for certain crimes is raised.\n\nThe cost of integrating Denmark’s immigrant population both as socio-cultural and economic members of the Danish population has been used as a justification for the passage of increasingly stringent immigration and refugee policy. Recent numbers calculating the cost of immigration welfare benefits to the Danish economy are debated due to the number of complex factors involved. One 1997 report from the Ministry for Immigrants, Refugees and Immigration stated that the total cost of immigrants and their descendants to the state, taking into account their tax contributions as well, was 10 billion Danish Kroner. The following section explores the conceptual and numeric economic costs and gains that Denmark has experienced as its immigrant population has increased in recent years.\n\nIn the 1990s Denmark was found to have the greatest gap between immigrant and native-born employment of all of the OECD countries. One study, published by the Think Tank on Integration in Denmark found \n\nA 1996 study of positive and negative net transfers to and from the Danish Public Sector found that although immigrants contributed a positive transfer to the national public sector tax base, they posed a negative transfer at the county and municipal level as primarily recipients of rather than contributors to public sector benefits. Immigrants from non-western countries of origin posed the greatest cost to the public sector, with the smallest positive contribution when compared to native Dane and second generation immigrants at the state level and the largest cost at the county, municipal, and unemployment insurance levels of the public sector budget. The particularly high cost to municipalities can be explained in part by municipalities’ responsibility to design and fund the integration of their resident immigrant populations. This same 1996 study found that the length of time immigrants live in Denmark can remediate some of these costs, with an increase in the number of years an immigrant lives in Denmark correlating a larger net contribution to the national, county, and municipal levels of the public sector. Despite this finding, the greater the number of years an immigrant lived in Denmark also correlated with a greater cost in unemployment insurance. A study published in 2003 found that in order for the net contribution of working age immigrants to meet their net costs to the public sector it would require 60% labor force participation within the population. Statistics such as these motivated the Danish government to pass the first Integration Act of 1999, which articulated labor market participation as a measurement of immigrant integration.\n\nDenmark does not have a nationally mandated minimum wage, rather trade unions regulate pay by lobbying for wage standards within their specific sectors. The strength of trade unions to influence wages relies upon their representation of the labor force and a lack of competition for lower wages. As immigration and free movement from European Union member countries have increased, trade unions and economic experts have speculated that an increase in workers outside of trade unions, especially in the unskilled labor market, will lead to a weakening of labor union bargaining power and a drop in native Dane’s wages.\n\nMany scholars have identified the influx of a younger immigrant population as a posing a possible economic benefit to the aging Danish population and its declining fertility by contributing to the tax base as a growing number of native Danes reach retirement age and collect their state pensions. This issue remains contested, however, due to the low rates of employment among immigrant populations with some scholars suggesting that the best solution to counter the aging Danish population coupled with the economic burdens of immigrants on the public sector would be longer labor market participation through an increase in retirement age.\n\nImmigrant and descendant men and women in Denmark are over-represented in crime statistics. A study of crime statistics from 1990 to 2001 found greater proportion of Non-western immigrant and descendant populations are convicted of committing a crime than Western immigrants and descendants and their Danish peers. The same study suggested that descendants of immigrants were found to have a slightly higher crime rate than immigrant populations.\n\nStudies have found that the types of crime that Danish nationals and immigrants and their descendants are found guilty of committing differ. A study of crime by country of origin from 1995 to 2000 found that Danes are more likely to violate the Road Traffic Act, whereas immigrants and descendants have a higher proportion of convictions for property violations and crimes of violence than Danes.\n\nThe incidence of crime within male second generation populations of Non-Western descent has been rising, with more than a 60% increase in crimes committed by members of this demographic group between 2007 and 2012. This growing crime rate has put pressure on politicians to design new legislature to deter criminal activity. In February 2014, the Danish Minister of Justice suggested that child support be cut to immigrant families with youth found guilty of a crime Currently immigrants convicted of a serious crime are excluded from obtaining permanent residence rights.\n\nImmigration and integration scholars have noted that differences in crime between native born citizens and immigrants and their descendants may indicate a lack of agreement with common societal rules and norms and therefore an indication of poor integration of foreigners into the greater population. Other explanations for the higher rates of arrest and conviction rates for immigrants have been the age demographic differences, Islam, different crime patterns, different confessional patterns, and ethnic profiling by law enforcement officials. Involvement in criminal activity has been linked to age and the foreign born population of Denmark includes a greater proportion of adolescents than the Danish population. The types of crimes committed may impact arrest and sentencing, and as the previously mentioned study pointed out, differences exist in the types of crime committed by demographic groups. A willingness to confess has been linked to dropped charges and acquittals. Two studies comparing the confession patterns of Danish and foreign born individuals found that individuals of a Danish background were twice as likely to confess to criminal charges than those of an immigrant background. Finally, a qualitative study of Danish police indicated that the ethnicity of an individual was a factor in police’s stop and search procedure, indicating that the number of arrests of immigrants and ethnic minority citizens in Denmark may be inflated due to a greater suspicion of the criminal actions of such individuals.\n\nDanish national police reported in 2012 that conviction rates per resident 1000 citizenship in Denmark were, per 1000: 12.9 for Danish, 114.4 for Somali and 54.3 for other citizenships, meaning that more than 1 in 10 Somalis citizens resident in Denmark were convicted for a crime.\n\nAccording to a 2015 report by Statistics Denmark, men born abroad had a 43% higher crime rate compared to the average of all men in Denmark. The highest rates were recorded from males from Lebanon, Somalia, Morocco, Syria and Pakistan. For male descendants of non-Western immigrants, the discrepancy was greater at 144%.\n\nAccording to the 2016 report by Statistics Denmark, the crime rate of non-Western male migrants was about three times that of the male population in Denmark. When correction for the greater proportion youth among non-Western migrants are taken into account and is adjusted for, the crime rate was two and half times that of the general male population. Male immigrants and male descendants from EU countries were among males with the lowest crime rate. When corrected for age, male immigrants from Germany, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom crime indices of less than half (43-48%) the average of all males in Denmark. Descendants from nearly all countries showed an over-representation, except descendants with roots in Iceland, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Syrian male descendants stand out where their crime rate is three times that of Syrian immigrants.\n\nAt 4%, male migrants aged 15-64 with non-Western backgrounds had twice the conviction rate against the Danish Penal Code in 2018, compared to 2% for Danish men. In a given year, about 13% of all male descendants of non-Western migrants aged 17-24 are convicted against the penal code.\n\nIn 1973, the first policy regarding immigrant language acquisition was enacted. This law required all foreign workers in Denmark to complete 40 hours of language instruction within a month of their arrival in Denmark. The Ministry of Social Affairs expanded this requirement in 1975 from 40 hours to 180 hours of language instruction accompanied by 40 hours of courses to introduce workers to norms of Danish society. Today, all applicants for permanent residency in Denmark must sign a Declaration on Integration and Active Citizenship in Danish Society which includes the following provision:\n\nImmigrants that have been granted residence permits based on family reunification are required to pass a Danish language test within six months of the date they registered at the National Register of Persons. Reunified spouses benefit from passing an optional second level of the language test, which upon passing, will reduce the amount of monetary collateral their partner has to provide as a requirement of their reunification.\n\nImmigrants arriving to Denmark have lower average levels of education than their Danish counterparts. Despite low levels of education within Denmark's immigrant population, enrollment of immigrants in continuing education is higher than other nations with similar immigrant demographics, such as Germany \n\nUntil 2006, Danish immigrant pupils had the privilege to receive instruction of their mother tongue. This practice was discontinued as it was found in a study of 450 immigrant pupils that such instruction did not improve test scores in numeracy or literacy in the PISA tests.\n\nParents of non-Western education have a 60% share with only primary education, compared to 20% of Danes.\n\nDuring the 2008-2009 school year, immigrants and descendants of immigrants constituted 10% of the children enrolled in primary and secondary school. Gaps exist between immigrant and immigrant descendants' and Danish enrollment in secondary education between the ages of 16 and 19 for both men and women. In addition to differences in enrollment in secondary education, immigrant students are more often enrolling in Vocational secondary education in Denmark rather than other forms of Secondary education in Denmark, which is a more popular educational pathway among their Danish peers. Second generation immigrants, however are enrolling in higher education at or above the level of their native Danish peers. In 2009, the number of women descendants of immigrants age 20 to 24 enrolled in higher education outnumbered Danish women for the first time and the number of descendant men age 20 to 24 enrolled in higher education was equal to that of Danish men.\n\nOn average, immigrant students have weaker performance levels in reading, math, and science than their Danish peers at the end of compulsory education One analysis of Denmark's results from the OECD's 2003 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test revealed that reading scores of Danish natives were much higher than those of immigrant and descendant students from Turkey, Lebanon, Pakistan, and former Yugoslavia, the four main countries of origin in the study. It was found that demographic characteristics such as the student's gender, number of siblings, language spoken at home, home education resources, the number of books in the home, parents' level of education, parents' income and occupation, and parents' labor market experience explained between 40 and 65% of the achievement gap between immigrant and native Dane test scores. Although it was predicted that second generation students would outperform their first generation counterparts, the study found that country of origin should be considered when evaluating second generation academic performance, with Pakistani and Lebanese second generation students performing better than first generation students, but Turkish and Yugoslavian second generation students performing at the same level as first generation students.\n\nIn 2012, according to PISA København, half of immigrant boys left primary education functionally illiterate.\n\nIn addition to the finding that student demographic characteristics concerning their family size, educational materials in the home, and their parents' socioeconomic status, the study found that schools with more than 10% immigrant students had greater achievement gaps between immigrant and descendant PISA scores and the scores of native Danish students. This indicates that school composition also has a significant effect on immigrant student achievement.\n\nAccording to Statistics Denmark, pupils with Vietnamese (highest), Danish, Sri Lankan and Iranian backgrounds scored at the top and pupils with backgrounds from Morocco, Somalia, Turkey and Lebanon (lowest) scored at the bottom. For all groups girls scored better than boys.\n\nThe \"PISA Etnisk 2015\" study indicated that the achievement gap of first-generation immigrants had narrowed to the level of second-generation immigrants from 2009 to 2015, but that the scores of second-generation immigrants had not improved in the same period.\n\nReligious Education is a compulsory subject in Danish public schools. In elementary schools, this class is often titled \"Kristendomskundskab\" (\"Knowledge about Christianity\"), but is perceived to be a culturally neutral course in which students learn of the historical religious and cultural values of Denmark, rather than elaborating on the core teachings of the Lutheran Folk Church as it had until the 1970s. Other or \"foreign religions\" were added as compulsory subjects in the Danish curriculum in 1975, but are taught exclusively at the upper grade levels, either within the Christian Studies course or in other courses such as History.\n\nImmigration and asylum gained increasing political salience in the 1990s and 2000s. Prior to the 1980s, immigration was not an issue that was included in political party manifestos. Immigration was first mentioned in political party agendas in 1981, when less than 1% of political agenda content was devoted to the issue. In 1987, 2.8% of Danish political party manifesto content mentioned immigration, after which mentions of immigration decreased below 1% until 1994 when the percentage jumped to 4.8% and then continued to increase to 7.7% during the 1998 election cycle and to 13.5% during the 2001 elections. When Danes were surveyed in 2001 about the most important issues politicians should address in the coming election, 51% of respondents listed immigrant and refugee populations. A disagreement on the issue of immigration within the coalition government in power, consisting of the Social Democratic Party and the Social Liberals, has been cited as a major cause of the Social Liberal Party's rise to power in coalition with the Danish Conservative People's Party and the Danish People's Party in the 2001 parliamentary elections.\n\nIn 2002, several of the Danish People's Party demands for stricter limitations to Denmark's family reunification policy were introduced into law. A new policy stipulated that spouses must be 24 years of age or older in order to qualify for spouse reunification, now commonly referred to as the 24-year rule. In addition, the Danish immigration authorities were tasked with assessing if each member of the couple applying for spouse reunification had a greater attachment to Denmark or to another nation. Spouse reunification was denied to any applicants who had received Danish social assistance within a year of their application and the person already residing in Denmark was required to provide bank documentation that he or she could provide financial collateral for public expenses to support his or her partner. A housing requirement mandated a space of 20 square meters per person in the accommodations provided by the current resident of Denmark. As a result of these policy changes, the number of family reunification permits granted fell from 13,000 in 2001 to less than 5,000 in 2005.\n\nSince the 2001 election, the Danish People's Party has become increasingly popular as it has focused its political agenda on issues of welfare and immigration. In the 2005 parliamentary election, the party increased their number of seats in parliament from 22 to 24 after winning 13.2% of the public vote. In the subsequent 2007 parliamentary elections, the Danish People's party again saw increased support with 13.9% of the vote leading them to gain one additional seat in parliament\n"}

They have been present since the late 19th century, when their first members were selected by the Dutch colonizers from the former Dutch East Indies.\n\nAfter the abolition of slavery, the plantations in Suriname needed a new source of labor. In 1890, the influential Netherlands Trading Society, owner of the plantation Mariënburg in Suriname, undertook a test to attract Javanese contract workers from the Dutch East Indies. Until then, primarily Hindustani contract workers from British India worked at the Suriname plantations as field and factory workers. \nOn August 9, the first Javanese arrived in Paramaribo. The test was considered successful and by 1894 the colonial government took over the task of recruiting Javanese hands. They came in small groups from the Dutch East Indies to the Netherlands, and from there to Paramaribo. The transport of Javanese immigrants continued until 1914 (except 1894) in two stages through Amsterdam.\n\nThe workers came from villages in Central and East Java. Departure points were Batavia, Semarang and Tandjong Priok. The recruited workers and their families awaited their departure in a depot, where they were inspected and registered and where they signed their contract.\n\nThe immigrants were recruited to work on the plantations. The exception was a group in 1904, when 77 Javanese were recruited specifically to work at the Colonial Railways. From World War I Javanese also worked at the Suriname Bauxite Company in Moengo. Immigration continued until December 13, \n1939. The outbreak of World War Two ended transplantation schemes.\n\nA total of 32,965 Javanese immigrants went to Suriname. In 1954, 8,684 Javanese returned to Indonesia, with the rest remaining in Suriname. The census of 1972 counted 57,688 Javanese in Suriname, and in 2004 there were 71,879. In addition, in 2004 more than 60,000 people of mixed descent were recorded, with an unknown number of part Javanese descent.\n\nIn 1953, a large group of 300 families (1,200 people), led by Salikin Hardjo, went back to Indonesia on the ship \"Langkuas\" of the Royal Rotterdam Lloyd. They intended to settle in Java or Lampung, but their request was not approved by the Indonesian government, and instead they were sent to West Sumatra. They established the village of \"Tongar\", also referred to as Tongass in Kabupaten Pasaman, north of Padang, clearing land and building new houses. They integrated smoothly with the Minangkabau community, despite the fact that most of the Javanese were Christian. Marriages with the mainly Muslim Minangkabau were common. The current generation is said to identify more as Indonesian than Surinamese, but still maintain contacts with family and friends in Suriname and the Netherlands, sometimes traveling to those countries.\n\nIn the 1970s, 20-25,000 Javanese Surinamese went to the Netherlands. They settled mainly in and around cities such as Groningen, Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Zoetermeer. They are well integrated into Dutch society, but preserve their Javanese identity through associations and regularly organized meetings. Most still have relatives in Suriname and send remittances, and regularly visiting Suriname.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10461194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10461194", "title": "Jogo do Bicho", "text": "Jogo do Bicho\n\nJogo do Bicho (\"the animal game\") is an illegal gambling game in Brazil, prohibited by federal law since 1946. Very popular throughout the country, the \"game\" is actually a lottery-type drawing operated on a regional basis by mobsters known as \"contraventores\" (who commit misdemeanors), \"bicheiros\" or \"banqueiros\" (\"bankers\"). Unlike most state-operated lotteries, in \"Jogo do Bicho\" you can bet any amount of money, even a cent. Despite its popularity (and being more or less tolerated, especially in Rio de Janeiro), it is still illegal in 25 of the 26 states of Brazil and those involved may be prosecuted. Paraíba is the only state where the game is legal and regulated by the state, even though according to a federal law this activity is prohibited. In other northeastern states the game is tolerated by the government.\n\nThe name of the game arises from the association of the drawn numbers with a random selection of 25 animals (to help memorising):\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the decades, superstitious theory has evolved around selecting the proper animal, much of it involving dreams. Horse, for example, can be indicated by a dream of a horse, or by dreams of wheat or milk or naked women. The elephant has come to be associated with death, and whenever there is a fatal traffic accident involving a car with one of the elephant's numbers (45-48) on its license plates, the betting is unusually heavy. When the Rio papers published the picture of a derailed locomotive in the 1960s, so many bet on the last four figures of its registration number that the \"bicheiros\" were forced to warn that they could not pay off at the usual odds if it won.\n\nEach of 25 different animals is assigned a sequence of four consecutive numbers. Ostrich is 01 to 04, Horse 41-44, Camel 29-32, and so on up to the Cow, which occupies 97-00. The most common way to play is to bet one Real on an animal. If the last two numerals in the daily state lottery draw form one of the four numbers designated by your animal, the bicheiro owes you 15 reais. For longer odds and higher payouts, you can try to pick the last three or even four numbers exactly, or you can choose a combination of a number and numerals designated by an animal.\n\nThere were traditionally four types of prizes:\n\nIn modern times the game has become more complex with many variations of the above that may pay up to 50000 times the bet.\n\nThe creation of the game is fairly well-documented: originator of the jogo do bicho was baron João Batista Viana Drummond, a bluff, bawdy, Brazilian-born Englishman, to whom Emperor Dom Pedro II gave a title and the concession to the Rio de Janeiro zoo. To popularize the zoo, the Baron encouraged visitors to guess the identity of an animal concealed behind a curtain, paid off to winners. In time the guessing game became a tremendously popular numbers game, with different numbers for 25 Brazilian beasts.\n\nTickets were soon being bought by those who hadn't even visited the zoo. Within months, government authorities made its first attempt to shut down the game. The animal lottery simply shifted to a new habitat in the city centre, an environment in which it has thrived ever since. Rudyard Kipling, visiting Rio in the 1920s, wrote of seeing bookies wandering the streets carrying placards with colourful pictures of animals.\n\nThe game became popular because it accepted bets of any amount, in a time when most people struggled to survive a very deep economic crisis. \"If you see two shacks lost somewhere in the backlands,\" a Brazilian diplomat once observed, \"you can bet that a bicheiro lives in one of them and a steady bettor in the other.\"\n\nFor decades official policy fluctuated between tolerance of the game, fueled by generous payoffs to authorities, and intermittent campaigns to snuff it out. Finally, in 1946, the government outlawed casinos and games of chance, the animal game among them. Nevertheless, it survives. Today it is played everywhere in Brazil, but continues to be controlled from Rio de Janeiro by about a dozen bosses, called \"bicheiros\".\n\nA crackdown on the game by the police in 1966 nearly paralysed São Paulo. More than 60,000 men were idled. At the time it had grown into a USD 500 million-a-year business that employed roughly 1% of Brazils total working force. The crisis was quietly resolved in return for unspecified concessions.\n\nSince its early inception the game has preserved a hierarchy: operators (\"banqueiros\"), managers (\"gerentes\") and dealers (\"vendedores\"). This same hierarchy was later reproduced in the organisation of drug-trafficking and other types of organised crime in Brazil (this is an important charge against the game, that it provides a structure that crime bosses can build upon).\n\nOperations are carried on at \"pontos\" (points-of-sale) where dealers collect money and keep record of the bets. The bets (and the money) are sent to the central operator (\"banca\"), where the draw is done. All it takes is a scribbled note or a phone call to any of the thousands of bicheiros who haunt the street corners, shops and offices of every city, easily identified by their sunglasses, cigars and/or typical floral or printed shirts. Neither the \"pontos\" nor the \"bancas\" need a fixed operational centre. Most pontos are simple stools or wooden boxes on which the dealers sit through the day.\n\nDrawings are usually held at 2 PM in local bicho headquarters, and the winning numbers are immediately dispatched by taxi and bicycle and scribbled in chalk on designated walls and lampposts. Phone lines become so clogged after each drawing that telephone company executives call it \"the bicho hour.\"\n\nThe draw is not fair: if too many people bet on a given number, it is removed from the lot to prevent the \"quebra da banca\" (bankruptcy). This is necessary because most bancas operate with slim resources and their owners do not want to invest their personal assets to pay the bets.\n\nSince the beginning of the 1990s, bicheiros have expanded their activities to bingo parlors, video poker and slot machines, known in Brazil as \"nickel hunters\" (caça-níqueis).\n\nBecause it deals with large sums of sounding money, out of reach of government control, the game has attracted the attention of corrupt officials, who may ally with the bosses. The bosses are always interested in buying the leniency of the government or the removal from office of people active on the game's repression. Due to its unlawful bonds with public officials of dubious character, the game still exists, more than a hundred years after its creation.\n\nTo foster public support, the bosses invested part of their enormous earnings in activities like the financing of samba schools and football clubs. From the early 1970s until now, nearly all of the Rio de Janeiro samba schools are under the control of bicho bosses (\"bicheiros\"). Two soccer clubs famous for their association with such bosses were Bangu (with Castor de Andrade) and Botafogo (with Emil Pinheiro).\n\"The animal game is a deeply embedded cultural phenomenon with a certain romantic aura, and thus hard to eradicate,\" according to Denise Frossard, a former judge who became famous for sending 14 \"bicheiros\" to jail in 1993. \"But it is also a quintessentially Brazilian way of laundering money and contributes greatly to the problem of impunity in this country.\" The \"bicheiros\" were arrested for criminal association and forming armed gangs. According to prosecutor Antônio Carlos Biscaia, the bicheiros built an association with the principal goal to corrupt authorities and cops and the elimination of 130 people. The superintendent of this association was Castor de Andrade. They were sentenced to six years each, the maximum sentence for racketeering. But in December 1996 they were all back on the streets, granted parole or clemency.\n\nIn March, 1994, police raided the stronghold of Castor de Andrade in Bangu. They seized 200 account books and 167 computer diskettes. The findings revealed that big names had been profiting from the illegal activities of bicho's Mafia. Among them, former president Fernando Collor de Mello, Rio governor Nilo Batista, São Paulo mayor Paulo Maluf, Rio mayor Cesar Maia, seven entrepreneurs, three judges, 12 congressmen and seven assemblymen, 25 police commissioners and 100 police officers.\n\nThe bicheiros Antonio Petrus Kalil, or Turcão, Anísio Abraão David, or Anísio, and Capitão Guimarães, at the time president of the Independent League of Samba Schools of Rio de Janeiro, were among 24 people arrested on April 12, 2007, for alleged involvement with illegal numbers games, bingo parlors and the distribution of slot machines. Raids by the Federal Police have uncovered big payoffs to judges, police officers, prosecutors and lawyers from the bosses who run the game. Mounds of documents have been seized and US$6 million in cash has been confiscated.\n\nThe possibility of legalisation has been often argued, but no practical decision on this subject has ever been made (perhaps because the game's bosses bribe the authorities not to usurp their business).\n\nDespite being illegal, the game left some cultural influences in Brazilian society, even among people that have never played it.\n\nOne of the most impressive influences of Jogo do Bicho is the strong association of the number 24 with homosexuality in Brazil. In the game, 24 is the number given to the deer (\"veado\" in Portuguese), an animal that has long been pejoratively associated with gay men. Men related with this number often have to deal with jokes about their sexuality. This happens, for example, with schoolboys listed as number 24 in the class' alphabetical list or men that are born on the 24th of any month.\n\nThe number 24 is heavily avoided by Brazilian male athletes, with rare exceptions. Football players, for example, usually reject this number for their jerseys, and may express dissatisfaction when obligated to wear a 24 jersey due to fixed number rules in international competitions. \n\nNumber 24 is also used in politics, as many LGBT candidates include 24 in their campaign numbers, to be easily associated with LGBT movement causes. For the same reason, the number is seldom used by heterosexual politicians, whether or not they have an anti-LGBT agenda. In the Brazilian Senate, for example, although there are 81 Senators, no one currently has a cabinet numbered 24, nor a car plate numbered SF-0024 (the Senators' plate options go from SF-0001 to SF-0095, and any available number can be freely chosen).\n\nAnother legacy of Jogo do Bicho is the use of \"zebra\" meaning upset. In 1964, before a football match between Portuguesa (RJ) and Vasco da Gama, the manager of Portuguesa, a much weaker team, was asked if he could defeat Vasco. Gentil Cardoso, the manager, commented that beating Vasco would be like drawing a zebra in Jogo do Bicho. As there is no zebra in the game, his sentence expressed an impossibility. However, Portuguesa did win that game (by 2-1), and since then the term \"zebra\" is used in Brazil for upsets in sports.\n\nTreze Futebol Clube, a football club from Paraíba, chose the rooster as their mascot, because \"Treze\" means thirteen, and the rooster is the 13th animal of the Jogo do bicho. Another football team that has the rooster as a mascot is Clube Atlético Mineiro, whose supporters expected 2013 to be the \"year of the Rooster\", also because the rooster is the 13th animal. Atlético Mineiro won their first Libertadores Cup in 2013, confirming the expectation for an important title in that year.\n\nParaíba is the only federal unity where the game is considered legal, despite the federal law that prohibits it. The game is regulated by the Lottery of Paraíba (LOTEP), which gives licenses for the \"bankers\" as lottery agents, to avoid the game to become associated with organized crime as in Rio de Janeiro. The state capital, João Pessoa, has 15 authorized points. Each point pays a monthly tax to LOTEP, the amount differs in each city, depending on its business volume, in João Pessoa the amount is R$6.000. The draw is made three times a day in the LOTEP building and released by the official state radio.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1343808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1343808", "title": "Jutlandic dialect", "text": "Jutlandic dialect\n\nJutlandic or Jutish (Danish: \"jysk\"; ) is the western dialect of Danish, spoken on the peninsula of Jutland in Denmark.\n\nGenerally, the eastern dialects are the closest to Standard Danish, while the southern dialect (\"Sønderjysk\") is the one that differs the most from the others; therefore it is sometimes described as a distinct dialect. Thus Jutlandic is by that definition actually two different dialects: general or Northern Jutlandic (\"nørrejysk\"; further divided into western and eastern) and Southern Jutlandic (\"sønderjysk\"). However, the linguistic variation is considerably more complicated and well over 20 separate minor dialects can be easily found on Jutland. This map shows nine larger dialectal regions which will be discussed in this article. There are major phonological differences between the dialects, but also very noteworthy morphological, syntactic, and semantic variations.\n\nThe different subdialects of Jutlandic differ somewhat from each other, and are generally grouped in three main dialects. \n\nThese are the abbreviations seen in the map linked above, which will be used throughout the rest of the article:\nNJy: Northern Jutlandic, NVJy: North Western Jutlandic, NØJy: North Eastern Jutlandic, MVJy: Mid-Western Jutlandic, MØJy: Mid-Eastern Jutlandic, Sy(d)Jy: Southern Jutlandic, SønJy: South Jutlandic, Djurs: Djurs-dialect, Sslesv: South Schleswig\n\n\n\n\nStandard Danish phonology contains nasal, aspirated voiceless and devoiced plosives (labial, alveolar, and velar). Four voiceless fricatives, [f], [s], [ɕ] and [h] are present, as well as approximants: [ʊ̯], [ð̞], [ɪ̯], and [ɐ̯]. There are also three regular and a lateral approximant, [ʋ], [l], [j] and [ʁ]. Below is a table depicting the consonant inventory of Danish. Phonemes that appear in standard Danish are in black and phonemes which are only seen in the dialects of Jutland (\"jysk\") are in bold. This table only includes phonemes and some allophones.\n\nThe major phonological process in Jutlandic consonants is lenition. This is the weakening of originally voiceless consonants in either the coda of a syllable or word as well as intervocallically. The weakening causes voicing as well as the fall from a stop to a fricative and finally to a sonorant. The final step of lenition is then complete apocope. This phenomenon can be seen in all its stages in the Jutlandic dialects, although it shows considerably more variability in the alveolars. The bilabials still have the approximant in one dialect, but no null phoneme and the velars have no sonorants, only a voiceless stop and fricative. The stages of the lenition as well as which dialects they occur in can be seen in the table below. Multiple possibilities for the same stage are shown separated by a semicolon. In Maps 4.0 and 4.2 the spread of the pronunciation of [d] and [g] are shown. The ÷ represents the null or zero morpheme in the maps, the -j and -r are [ɪ̯] and [ɐ̯] respectively and q is the devoiced velar stop [ɡ̊] while ch stands for the fricative [χ]. Vends and Læsø are regions usually belonging to the NJy dialectal region whereas Fjolds is the border region between Germany and Denmark, normally considered part of South Jutlandic (\"Sønderjysk\").\n\ne.g. In Southern Jutlandic, Scandinavian post-vocalic \"p, k\" become word-finally, whereas Standard Danish has \"b, g\", e.g. \"søge\" 'to seek' = Standard Danish , \"tabe\" 'lose' = Standard Danish . In the northern part of Southern Jutland, these sounds are voiced fricatives between vowels, i.e. : e.g. \"søger\" 'seeks' = Standard Danish , \"taber\" 'loses' = Standard Danish .\n\nStandard Danish has a large vowel inventory and contrasts length on many vowels. Vowels can also be glottalized where the so-called \"stød\" is present and many change their quality depending on whether or not it is preceded or followed by an /r/.\n\nJutlandic exhibits many diphthongs, which are not present in standard Danish. The long stressed mid vowels, /e:/, /ø:/, and /o:/ become /iə/, /yə/, and /uə/ respectively in central Jutland as well as SSlesv, e.g. \"ben\" = Standard Danish 'leg', \"bonde\" 'farmer' = Standard Danish (< \"bōndi\"). SønJy has the same vowel quality for these vowels, but exhibits a tonal distinction, which is present in place of the Danish \"stød\". NJy raises them without diphthonging them to /i:/, /y:/, and /u:/ respectively. In a small area of Mid Western Jutland called Hards the vowels become diphthonged with a glide, much like in English and are pronounced as /ej/, /øj/, and /ow/. In Norther Jutland /i:/, /y:/, and /u:/ are also diphthonged in two syllable words with a glide. NJy always has the glide present (/ij/, /yj/, /uw/) and NVJy tends towards the glide, but it is not present for all speakers. Long \"a\" and \"å\" have been raised to and respectively in northern Jutlandic, e.g. \"sagde\" 'said' = Standard Danish , \"gå\" 'go, walk' = Standard Danish . Map 2.2 shows the different possible pronunciations for the standard Danish mid, stressed vowels which is further explained in the following table. \nOutside of these diphthongs arising from changes in pronunciation from standard Danish long vowels, there are also the following diphthongs: [ow], [ɔw], [ej], [æj] [ɒw] [iw]/[yw], [ew]/[øw] and [æw]/[œw]. [ow] and [ɔw] are both present in Vends, NVJy and MVJy but only one occurs in Østjysk, SønJy and SydJy. There is a tendency towards [ɔw], but in MØJy [ow] can be found instead. The same sort of alternation is also seen with [ej] and [æj]. In MVJy, NJy and NVJy both diphthongs exist. In MØJy there is an alternation between the two, but each speaker only has one. In SydJy and SønJy only [æj] is found. [ɒw] is present as a diphthong in all of Jutland with the exception of the island of Fanø (off of South western Jutland), but has different pronunciations depending on length of the segments. The remaining diphthongs show a distribution based on rounding. In the majority of Jutland the unrounded diphthong is rounded. In South Eastern Jutland the rounded one is unrounded and only in certain parts of Sønderjylland are both diphthongs preserved. Map 2.7 shows the rounding alternation for the front, close diphthong [iw]/[yw].\n\nAn interesting phenomenon in western SønJy and MVJy, NVJy as well as NJy is the so-called \"klusilspring\". The \"klusilspring\" can be seen as a modified \"stød\" that only occurs on high vowels (/i:/, /y:/, and /u:/). These long vowels are shortened and then followed by a \"klusil\", or plosive, or in some cases a spirant. (See Map 2.1) In Vends (NJy) and western South Jutlandic the three pronunciations become: [itj], [ytj], and [uk] and they have the same pronouciation but followed by a schwa if not in the coda. An area in NVJy designated on the map as Him-V has instead [ikj], [ykj] and [uk] and in MVJy it is similar with the /u:/ also containing a glide [ukw] and in all three cases a schwa is inserted if it is not in the coda of the syllable. The rest of NVJy along the coast has the schwa as well but a fricative instead of a stop, so the sounds are [iɕ], [yɕ], and [uɕ]. In the rest of the Jutlandic dialects the vowel quality is overall the same, with gliding in NVJy (Han-V and Han-Ø) on the map and only unrounded front vowels in Djurs.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the \"klusilspring\" is an alternate of the \"stød\" that occurs only with high vowels. In the other mainland Scandinavian languages as well as SønJy, there are two different tonemes which distinguish between words that were originally one or two syllables. Tone 1 is a simple rising then falling tone in most dialects and tone 2 is more complex, e.g. \"hus\" 'house' = Standard Danish ~ \"huse\" 'houses' = Standard Danish . In standard Danish as well as Jutlandic, tone 1 is replaced with a nonsegmental glottalization and tone 2 disappears entirely. Glottalization can only occur on vowels or sonorants and only in one or two-syllable words and is realized in transcription as a [']. However, in two-syllable words the second syllable must be a derivational morpheme as the historical environment of tone 1 was one-syllable words and tone 2 only occurred on two-syllable words. Due to apocope and the morphology, both tones and the \"stød\" can now be found on one- and two-syllable words. There can be multiple \"stød\" segments per word, if the word is a compound, which separates its phonetically from the tonemes of Swedish, Norwegian and South Jutlandic, which can only occur once over the whole word. However, in contrast to the standard Danish \"stød\", the Jutlandic \"stød\" does not usually occur in monosyllabic words with a sonorant + voiceless consonant. Only Djurs and the city dialect of Aarhus have the \"stød\" in this environment. As mentioned before, most of north west Jutland does not have a \"stød\" after short high vowels, and instead has the \"klusilspring\". The \"stød\" is still present on sonorants and mid and low vowels in the proper environment. Western Jutlandic also has a \"stød\" on the vowel in originally two-syllable words with a geminate voiceless consonant such as {tt}, {kk}, or {pp} e.g. \"katte\" 'cats' = Standard Danish ; \"ikke\" 'not' = Standard Danish .\n\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Scandinavian languages is the postclitic definite marker. For example: \"en mand\" 'a man', \"mand-en\" 'the man'. In standard Danish this postclitic marker is only used when there is no adjective present, but if there is an adjective, a definite article is used instead: \"den store mand\" 'the big man'. Further, standard Danish has a two gender system, distinguishing between the neuter (\"intetkøn, -et)\" and \"other\" (\"fælleskøn, -en\") genders. In Jutland, however, very few dialects match the standard in these two aspects. There are dialects with one, two and three genders, as well as dialects lacking the postclitic definite marker entirely.\n\nOriginally the Scandinavian languages, like modern German as well as Icelandic, had three genders. These three genders, masculine, feminine, and neuter are still present in many dialects, notably most dialects of Norwegian. However, in all standard versions of the mainland Scandinavian languages, there are only two genders (Norwegian has three genders, but in Bokmål – one of two written standards – feminine nouns may be inflected like the masculine nouns, making it possible to use only two genders). The masculine and feminine fell together, taking the masculine article (or the feminine in Insular Danish), and the neuter stayed separate. Three genders remain in northern Jutland and far in the east, which could potentially be explained through dialect contact with both Norwegian and Swedish dialects which preserve all three genders. The loss of all gender distinction in the west, though, is unique to Jutlandic. Note though that West Jutlandic still have two noun classes, \"n\"- and \"t\"-words like standard Danish, they are just not genders. \"t\"-words in West Jutlandic are limited to mass nouns.\n\nThe definite marker is also not consistent in the Jutlandic dialects. In the west, where only one gender is present, as well as in all of SydJy and SønJy, the definite marker is a free morpheme that comes before the noun. It is not, however, the same as the free morpheme found in standard Danish when an adjective precedes a noun. It is phonetically realised as [æ].\n\nThere are also small areas in Jutland where predicate adjectives as well as adjectives in indefinite noun phrases have gender congruence in the neuter form. In SSlesv, easternmost Djurs and on the island of Samsø, adjectives take a -\"t\" ending which patterns with standard Danish: for example, \"et grønt glas\" and \"glasset er grønt\". [æt gʁœːnt glas; glas.ət æ gʁœːnt] 'a green glass; the glass is green' In Vends (NJy) there is no congruence on adjectives in indefinite noun phrases, but the -\"t\" is still present in predicate adjectives. The variability in the examples also reflects differences between number of genders, postclitic versus enclitic article and apocope. [æ gʁœn' glas; glast æ gʁœnt] (same gloss) In the rest of Jutland, as a result of apocope, the -\"t\" disappears completely: [ æt (æn) gʁœn' glas; glas.ə(t) (æ glas) æ gʁœn'] (same gloss).\n\nThe presence of a separate free morpheme definite marker in the western Jutlandic dialects [æ] has come to cause a contrastive semantic meaning difference with the standard Danish dem. Nouns that can be analyzed as mass nouns, as opposed to count nouns can take the [æ] article before an adjective. If the noun is, however, meant to be a count noun it uses the standard Danish plural article \"dem\". An example of this would be \"dem små kartofler\" versus \"æ små kartofler\" 'the small potatoes'. \"Dem små kartofler\" refers to the small potatoes in a set, i.e. those 5 small potatoes on the table. \"Æ små kartofler\" refers instead to a mass noun, meaning potatoes that are generally small. It is like saying \"the yellow potatoes\" in English. It can either mean yellow potatoes as a whole, a mass noun or the yellow potatoes sitting on the table, as opposed to the red ones.\n\nThere is also a tendency to use \"hans\" or \"hendes\" instead of the \"correct\" \"sin\" when referring to the subject of the sentence. This means there is no longer a distinction between whether the possessive pronoun refers to the subject of the sentence or a third person, however, use of a word like \"egen/t\" 'own' can paraphrastically accomplish the same thing.\n\nToday the old dialects, tied as they were to the rural districts, are yielding to new regional standards based on Standard Danish. Several factors have contributed to this process. The dialects, especially in the northernmost, western and southern regions, are often hard to understand for people originating outside Jutland.\n\nThe dialects also enjoy little prestige both nationally (the population of Zealand like to believe that the Jutlanders are slower not only in speech but also in thought) and regionally (the dialect is associated with rural life).\n\nThe Danish cultural, media and business life revolves around Copenhagen, and Jutland has only in recent decades seen substantial economic growth. In the 20th century dialects were usually suppressed by media, state institutions, and schools. In recent decades, a more liberal attitude towards dialects has emerged, but since the number of speakers has decreased, and almost all of the remaining dialect speakers master a regional form of Standard Danish as well, dialects are still being ignored.\n\nThe new Jutlandic \"regiolects\" differ from the Copenhagen variety primarily bu a distinct accent:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37688948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37688948", "title": "LGBT Aging Project", "text": "LGBT Aging Project\n\nThe LGBT Aging Project is a Boston-based non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults have equal access to life-prolonging benefits, protection, services and institutions as heterosexual adults. Founded in 2001, the project provides cultural competence and institutional capacity training to elder service providers on how to create and sustain LGBT welcoming environments, develop community-building programs for LGBT older adults and caregivers, and also works to enact policy and legislative changes to improve access to care and benefits for LGBT elders. . The LGBT Aging Project was recently featured in the 2010 award-winning documentary Gen Silent.\n\nThe LGBT Aging Project was founded in 2001 by a group of advocates from the aging service network and individuals from the LGBT community. The Greater Boston LGBT Aging Summit was held in June 2001 in order to create an action plan for the needs of LGBT elders. In the fall of 2001, the action plan created at the summit was released at a Massachusetts state house press conference.\n\nIn 2002, the LGBT Aging Project began organizing work groups on aging and health policy, training and programs delveopment, housing and the creation of new programs within the project. The project also hired their first full-time director, Amy Hunt, and received a funding grant from the Boston Foundation. It was also in 2002 that the project defined their mission as \"ensuring that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender older adults and their caregivers have equal access to the life-prolonging benefits, protections, services and institutions that their heterosexual neighbors take for granted.\"\n\nThe year 2003 proved to be a major time of legislative change and policy action and advocacy for the LGBT Aging Project. The LGBT Aging Project was involved with marriage equality advocacy – through testimonies at the Massachusetts State House by both LGBT Aging Project members as well as LGBT older adults. Also in 2003, the LGBT Aging Project became more visible in the community through numerous presentations & events, such as the first Boston Pride Tea Dance for LGBT elders and their friends. The first LGBT caregiver support group also started in 2003 after the LGBT Aging Project was awarded an initial grant from the Caregiver Alliance of Suffolk County.\n\nOn May 17, 2004, marriage equality became a reality for the state of Massachusetts, partly due to the role that the LGBT Aging Project played in legislative advocacy for the cause. The LGBT Aging Project lost Amy Hunt as its director during 2004, and gained its current executive director, Lisa Krinsky. The LGBT Aging Project also made great strides in its development as it created a pilot program for the \"Open Door Task Force\" LGBT cultural competency training program, initiated trainings with major Area Agencies on Aging and Aging Service Access Points in Massachusetts, and opened Café Emmanuel with Ethos, a Boston area Aging Service Access Point. Café Emmanuel is Massachusetts’ first federally funded meal program for LGBT older adults and their friends.\n\nSince 2005, the LGBT Aging Project has hosted numerous community forums for LGBT elders and held many state funded LGBT training and outreach sessions within the state Elder Service Network. In 2006, Bob Linscott, the current assistant director, was hired as a part-time outreach worker and site coordinator for Café Emmanuel. The year 2007 saw Bob rise to the full-time assistant director, and the LGBT Aging Project sponsored a number of events, including the Pride week event, \"LGBT Veterans Share their Stories\" and Stu Maddux’s film, “Bob and Jack’s 52 Year Adventure” at the Boston LGBT Film Festival. The LGBT Aging Project also launched a second LGBT friendly meal program with Ethos, “Out to Brunch”, for lesbian, bisexual and transgender women.\n\nIn 2008, a major stride was made in the Massachusetts state legislation with the passage of the MassHealth Equality Law, largely due to the work done by the LGBT Aging Project. This law ensures that same sex couples who are legally married in Massachusetts have equal access to eligibility evaluation when applying for the state’s Medicaid program.\n\nSince 2010, the LGBT Aging Project has secured funding to create LGBT bereavement support groups and healthy aging programs. The LGBT Aging Project also co-sponsored the Gen Silent premiere at the Boston LGBT Film Festival in 2010, in which it was featured along with six LGBT seniors in the Boston area.\n\n2010 also saw the LGBT Aging Project become an inaugural training partner for the National Resource Center on LGBT Aging, the first federally funded resource on LGBT Aging, which is sponsored by the Administration on Aging.\n\nThe LGBT Aging Project receives funding through a variety of sources including state grants, foundations and individuals.\n\nThe LGBT Aging Project offers several direct services – an LGBT caregiver support group, LGBT bereavement support groups, and \"Healthy Aging in the LGBT Community\" programs, which include topics such as nutrition and memory fitness. Also, the LGBT Aging Project provides \"Open Door Task Force\" training and development, in which it assists mainstream elder service providers in evaluating organizational and program policies, offering practice skills training for direct service workers, and developing and delivering LGBT-welcoming programs and services. The LGBT Aging Project also makes civic leadership a priority by working to effectively sustain change in legislative policies that create equity for LGBT older adults and caregivers, as well as through gaining information and research that demonstrates the needs of LGBT people as they age.\n\nIn addition to the regular programs offered, the LGBT Aging Project also holds numerous special events and conferences to help bring about awareness of issues facing LGBT older adults and caregivers.\n\nLisa Krinsky and Bob Linscott have been recognized on numerous occasions for their work with the LGBT Aging Project. In 2008, Linscott was recognized as the \"Person of the Year\" in the LGBT community by the Bay Windows Newspaper. Both Krinsky and Linscott were recognized by Boston Spirit Magazine in 2009 as \"People To Know\". The project itself received the \"Somerville Cambridge Elder Services LGBT Award\" in 2009 and was featured on the front page of the October 9, 2007 New York Times with an article highlighting the struggle of LGBT elders.\n\nIn 2011, Krinsky was a \"Robert Wood Johnson Community Health Leader\" finalist and in 2012 the LGBT Aging Project was named a \"Social Innovator in Healthy Aging\" by Root Cause's Social Innovation Forum.\n\n\n"}

Local governments can be more reflective of local needs and interests and a prime driver of innovation in government practices; at the same time, local service delivery deals with some challenges, such as expertise concerns, steering problems, and the presence of economies of scale. Local service delivery is a key topic of discussion for academics and practitioners in the wake of the decentralization and corporatization that occurred under New Public Management and in the wake of local austerity following the 2008 Financial crisis.\n\nLocal service delivery can take place in many ways. Local services can be delivered directly by the municipality’s bureaucracy, by municipal corporations, by public-private partnerships, by inter-municipal cooperation, and by private organizations through contracting or privatization. \nSince switching between the multiple options of service delivery often incurs costs, there is often high path dependency in local service delivery that makes it difficult to easily adjust policy choices to changed political and economic environments.\n\nWhile local government is not a necessary part of modern government, it is often an integral part. Local government is closer to the citizens than higher layers of government and can be more reflective of local needs and interests.\n\nLocal government can be a driver of innovative government. Due to the frequent presence of competition between local governments and their sheer numbers, there is much diversity in local service delivery. The presence of networks allows limited policy learning between local governments, and so innovative ideas can spread and eventually make their way into other levels of government.\n\nLocal service delivery involves expertise concerns. Since it is (due to geographic size) less likely that local governments possess certain types of expertise than higher layers of government, they are more dependent on outside actors for service delivery, and yet less capable of monitoring them. Such steering issues are a source of inefficiency for local service delivery.\n\nIt is often the case that service delivery gets costlier as the population gets smaller, since there are high fixed costs of public policy. Thus, cooperation is a central theme in local government for many services.\n\nExamples of local services include:\n"}
{"id": "6531713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6531713", "title": "Lurs", "text": "Lurs\n\nLurs (also Lors, Lurish: لُرو and لورَل Persian:لُرها) are an Iranian people living mainly in western and south-western Iran. Their population is estimated at around five million. They occupy Lorestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Khuzestan and Fars (especially Lamerd, Mamasani and Rostam), Bushehr, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Hamadan, Ilam, and Isfahan provinces.\nThe Lur people mostly speak the Lurish language (sometimes called \"Luri\"), a Southwestern Iranian language related to Persian. According to the \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\", the Lurish language is the closest living language to Archaic and Middle Persian. According to the linguist Don Still, Lori-Bakhtiari like Persian is derived directly from Old Persian. Michael M. Gunter states that Lur people are closely related to the Kurds but that they \"apparently began to be distinguished from the Kurds 1,000 years ago.\" There is also a significant population of Iraqi Lurs in the eastern and central parts of Iraq, mainly known as Feylis.\n\nLurs are the demographic majority of the provinces of Kohkiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Ilam, Lorestan, and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari. Half of Khuzestan's population is Lur and 30% of Bushehr's population is Lur.\n\nLurish is a Western Iranian language continuum spoken by the Lurs in Western Asia. Lurish language forms five language groups known as Feyli Lurish, Central Lurish, Bakhtiari, Laki and the Southern Lurish. \nThis language is spoken mainly by the Feyli Lurs (including Khorram Abadi, Maleki, and Laks), Bakhtiari, and Southern Lurs (Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Mamasani, Sepidan, Bandar Ganaveh, Deylam).\nRichard N. Frye wrote that \"the Lurs and their dialects are closely related to the Persians of Fars province, and naturally belong to the southwestern branch of the Iranian peoples...\"\nThe Lurish language is divided into two main groups:\n\nLurs are a mixture of aboriginal Iranian tribes, originating from Central Asia and the pre-Iranic tribes of western Iran, such as the Kassites (whose homeland appears to have been in what is now Lorestan) and Gutians. In accordance to geographical and archaeological matching, some historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-Lurs, whose language became Iranian only in the Middle Ages. Michael M. Gunter states that they are closely related to the Kurds but that they \"apparently began to be distinguished from the Kurds 1,000 years ago.\" He adds that the \"Sharafnama\" of Sharaf Khan Bidlisi \"mentioned two Lur dynasties among the five Kurdish dynasties that had in the past enjoyed royalty or the highest form of sovereignty or independence.\" In the \"Mu'jam Al-Buldan\" of Yaqut al-Hamawi mention is made of the Lurs as a Kurdish tribe living in the mountains between Khuzestan and Isfahan. The term Kurd according to Richard Frye was used for all Iranian nomads (including the population of Luristan as well as tribes in Kuhistan and Baluchis in Kirman) for all nomads, whether they were linguistically connected to the Kurds or not. \n\nConsidering their NRY variation, the Lurs are distinguished from other Iranian groups by their relatively elevated frequency of Y-DNA Haplogroup R1b (specifically, of subclade R1b1a2a-L23). Together with its other clades, the R1 group comprises the single most common haplogroup among the Lurs. Haplogroup J2a (subclades J2a3a-M47, J2a3b-M67, J2a3h-M530, more specifically) is the second most commonly occurring patrilineage in the Lurs and is associated with the diffusion of agriculturalists from the Neolithic Near East c. 8000-4000 BCE. Another haplogroup reaching a frequency above 10% is that of G2a, with subclade G2a3b accounting for most of this. Also significant is haplogroup E1b1b1a1b, for which the Lurs display the highest frequency in Iran. Lineages Q1b1 and Q1a3 present at 6%, and T at 4%.\n\nThe authority of tribal elders remains a strong influence among the nomadic population. It is not as dominant among the settled urban population. As is true in Kurdish societies, Lur women have much greater freedom than women in other groups within the region. The women have had much freedom to participate in different social activities, to wear female diverse clothing and to sing and dance in different ceremonies. Bibi Maryam Bakhtiari, and Qadam Kheyr are two notable Lurish women from Iran. Lurish music, Lurish clothing and Lurish folk dances are from the most distinctive ethno-cultural characteristics of this ethnic group.\n\nThe Lur peoples are diverse and individualistic in their religious views and practices. Religious views can differ immensely, even within a family group. While the overwhelming majority of Lurs are Shia Muslims, some practice a medieval Iranian religion known as Yaresan, which has roots in pre-Islamic Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, and Manichaeism. Traditionally, the Lur people outwardly profess Shia Islam, and the religion of some is a mixture of Ahl-e Haqq involving a belief in successive incarnations combined with ancient rites called Ali-Illahism.\n\n\n"}

The Mary Meachum Freedom Crossing in St. Louis, the first site in Missouri to be accepted in the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, was named after her.\n\nMeachum was born into slavery in Kentucky. While still enslaved, she married John Berry Meachum, who had already purchased his own freedom with money he had earned as a carpenter. In 1815, Mary Meachum's owner took her to St. Louis, Missouri. Her husband followed and purchased her freedom shortly afterwards. The Meachums ran a school for free and enslaved black people in the First African Baptist Church, which they later moved to a floating steamboat on the Mississippi River when the state of Missouri banned education for blacks in 1847. They also used the proceeds from John Berry Meachum's carpentry and barrel-making business to purchase freedom for twenty enslaved individuals.\n\nMary Meachum's profession was listed as 'milkmaid' in 1835.\n\nAfter John Berry Meachum died in 1854, Mary Meachum continued running their home on Fourth Street as a 'safe house' on the Underground Railroad. On May 21, 1855, after an attempt to ferry nine enslaved people across the Mississippi River to freedom in Illinois, Meachum and a freedman named Isaac were arrested for breaking the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. On May 24, 1854, she was charged in court with slave theft, while charges against Isaac were dropped.\n\nThe Missouri Republican reported on July 19, 1855 that Mary was tried by a jury and acquitted of at least one charge, and the remaining charges were dropped.\n\nOne scholar says Meachum was sold into slavery in Vicksburg, Mississippi, after her arrest. However, the \"Daily Missouri Democrat\" reported on December 17, 1864, that Meachum was at that time president of the Colored Ladies Soldiers' Aid Society in St. Louis. This organization of free black women, also called the Colored Ladies Contraband Society, was formed in 1863 to assist black Union soldiers and escaped slaves in St. Louis during the Civil War. Because blacks were not allowed to ride streetcars at that time, the women negotiated with the streetcar company to ride the streetcar one day a week, on Saturdays, to the segregated wing of the Benton Barracks Hospital of St. Louis, where wounded black soldiers were hospitalized. There, the women read to the soldiers, comforted them, and taught them to read. The white nurse in charge of the hospital, Emily Parsons, wrote of her outrage that the women were limited to only one day a week and described them as \"intelligent colored women, ladies in fact, many of them well educated and wealthy.\"\n\nMeachum died in St. Louis in August, 1869. She is memorialized with her husband in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.\n\nThe Mary Meachum Freedom Crossing, part of the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, was dedicated, Nov 1, 2001, in a special ceremony on the Riverfront Trail. Since then, it has hosted the annual Mary Meachum Freedom Crossing Celebration, an event which includes re-enactments of Mary Meachum's river crossing and arrest. The site is located just north of the Merchants Bridge in St. Louis. In 2014, plans were underway to expand the site to a national historical monument to the Underground Railroad, which would include interpretive towers, a wall of names, and healing gardens.\n"}

{"id": "16961745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16961745", "title": "Middle-class squeeze", "text": "Middle-class squeeze\n\nThe middle-class squeeze is the situation where increases in wages fail to keep up with inflation for middle-income earners leading to a relative decline in real wages, while at the same time, the phenomenon fails to have a similar effect on the top wage earners. People belonging to the middle class find that inflation in consumer goods and the housing market prevent them from maintaining a middle-class lifestyle, undermining aspirations of upward mobility. In the United States, middle-class income is declining while many goods and services are increasing in price, such as education, housing, child care, and healthcare.\n\nFormer U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi used the term in November 2006 to provide context to the domestic agenda of the U.S. Democratic Party. The Center for American Progress (CAP) issued a report of the same title in September 2014. However, variations on the theme have been used by politicians attempting to describe the financial challenges facing the middle class and to appeal to the middle class voter for much longer.\n\nThe term \"squeeze\" in this instance refers to rising costs of key products and services coupled with stagnant or declining real (inflation adjusted) wages. The Center for American Progress (CAP) defines the term \"middle class\" as referring to the middle three quintiles in the income distribution, or households earning between the 20th to 80th percentiles in income. CAP reported in 2014: \"The reality is that the middle class is being squeezed. As this report will show, for a married couple with two children, the costs of key elements of middle-class security—child care, higher education, health care, housing, and retirement—rose by more than $10,000 in the 12 years from 2000 to 2012, at a time when this family’s income was stagnant.\" Further, CAP argued that when the middle class is struggling financially, the economy struggles from a shortfall in overall demand, which reduces economic growth (GDP) relative to its potential. The goal of addressing the middle class squeeze includes: \"Having more workers in good jobs—who have access to good education; affordable child care, health care, and housing; and the ability to retire with dignity.\"\n\nCharles Weston summarizes the middle-class squeeze in this way: \"Being middle class used to mean having a reliable job with fair pay; access to health care; a safe and stable home; the opportunity to provide a good education for one’s children, including a college education; time off work for vacations and major life events; and the security of looking forward to a dignified retirement. But today this standard of living is increasingly precarious. The existing middle class is squeezed and many of those striving to attain the middle-class standard find it persistently out of reach.\" This squeeze is also characterised by the fact that, since the early 1980s, when European integration got into full swing, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom have experienced strong real wage growth, while real wage growth in the United States has remained sluggish for the most part.\n\nCauses include factors related to income as well as costs. For the U.S., on the income side, middle class wages have stagnated (in \"real\" terms, meaning adjusted for inflation) along with worsening income inequality, which has shifted more income to the top of the income distribution and away from the middle class. For example, real median household income did not regain record 1999 levels again until 2016. However, the costs of important goods and services such as healthcare, college tuition, child care, and housing (utilities, rent or mortgages) have increased considerably faster than the rate of inflation. Recasting the 2012 income using the 1979 income distribution, the bottom 99% of families would have averaged about $7,100 more income.\n\nThere are many causes of middle-class income stagnation in the United States. One narrative involves the interplay of globalization, supply chain innovation and technology, which has enabled lower-wage workers in developing countries (e.g., China) to compete with higher-wage workers in developed countries (e.g., the U.S.) As a result, middle-class incomes have grown in developing countries like China much faster than in the U.S. measured from 1988 to 2008.\n\nAnother narrative described by Paul Krugman is that a resurgence of movement conservatism since the 1970s, embodied by Reaganomics in the United States during the 1980s, resulted in a variety of policies that favored owners of capital and natural resources over laborers. Many developed countries did not have an increase in inequality similar to the United States over the 1980-2006 period, even though they were subjected to the same market forces via globalization. This indicates U.S. policy was a major factor in widening inequality.\n\nEither way, the shift is visible when comparing productivity and wages. From 1950 to 1970, improvement in real compensation per hour tracked improvement in productivity. This was part of the implied contract between workers and owners. However, this relationship began to diverge around 1970, when productivity began growing faster than compensation. A declining labor movement, increasing executive pay relative to the average worker, financialization of the economy, and increasing diversion of corporate profits to stock buybacks and dividends are some of the contributing factors to this wage stagnation. In general, for a variety of reasons, the power of lower paid laborers relative to capitalists and landlords has declined.\n\nRecent trends indicate wages have stagnated and income inequality has worsened, reducing income available to middle-class families:\n\nIn 1995, 60% of American workers were labouring for real wages below previous peaks, while at the median, “real wages for nonsupervisory workers were down 13 percent from peak 1973 levels.” In a study conducted in 2006 by The United States House of Representatives, there were some interesting income findings that show the effects of the middle-class squeeze. According to the study, not only is real income decreasing for the middle class, but also the gap between the top wage earners and the middle earners is widening.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2005 real median household income in the United States has declined by 2.5%, falling each of the first four years of the Bush Administration, falling by as much as 2.2% annually. Overall real median income has declined since 2000, by $1,273, from $47,599 in 2000, to $46,326 in 2005. According to the survey, working-class families headed by adults younger than 65 have seen even steeper declines. Although they had seen an increase in real median household income from 1995 to 2000 of 9%, since 2000 their income has fallen every year by a total of 5.4%. In actual money terms this correlates to a decrease of $3,000 from $55,284 to $52,287. In 1973, median earnings for men who worked full-time, year-round stood at $51,670 in inflation-adjusted 2012 dollars, while, in 2012, the real median earnings of men who worked full-time, year-round stood at $49,398; about 4.4% below the peak median earnings of $51,670 in 1973.\n\nThe other way in which income affects the middle class, is through increases in income disparity. Findings on this issue show that the top 1% of wage earners continue to increase the share of income they bring home, while the middle-class wage earner loses purchasing power as his or her wages fail to keep up with inflation. Between 2002 and 2006, the average inflation adjusted income of the top 1% of earners increased by 42%, whereas the bottom 90% only saw an increase of 4.7%.\n\nA 2001 article from “Time Magazine” highlighted the development of the middle-class squeeze. The middle class was defined in that article as those families with incomes between the Census Bureau brackets of $15,000 and $49,999. According to the census, the proportion of American families in that category, after adjustment for inflation, fell from 65.1% in 1970 to 58.2% in 1985. As noted in the article, the heyday of the American middle class, and its high expectations, came in the Fifties and Sixties, when the median U.S. family income (adjusted to 2001 price levels) went up from $14,832 in 1950 to $27,338 in 1970. The rising prosperity was, however, halted by the inflation of the Seventies, which carried prices aloft more rapidly than wages and thus caused real income levels to stagnate for more than a decade. The median in 2000 was only $27,735, barely an improvement from 1970.\n\nAs noted by the British historian and journalist Godfrey Hodgson,\n\"On the basis of such evidence I myself have written that “by all statistical measures . . . the United States, in terms of income and wealth, is the most unequal country in the world. While the average income in the United States is still almost the highest in the world . . . the gap between wealth and poverty is higher than anywhere else, and is growing steadily greater”.\"\n\nAs noted by another historian,\n“Not long ago, unskilled US workers enjoyed what might have been called an “American premium.” They were paid more than labourers with the same skills in other parts of the world simply because, as unskilled Americans, they would work with higher capital-to-labor ratios, better raw materials, and larger numbers of highly skilled fellow workers than their foreign counterparts. As a result, America’s unskilled workers were relatively more productive and thus earned higher wages than similar unskilled workers elsewhere in the world.”\n\nWhile overall inflation has generally remained low since 2000, the costs of certain categories of \"big ticket\" expenses have grown faster than the overall inflation rate, such as healthcare, higher education, rent, and child care. These goods and services are considered essential to a middle-class lifestyle yet are increasingly unaffordable as household income stagnates.\n\nThe Center for American Progress reported in September 2014 that the real (inflation adjusted) cost of healthcare for middle-class families had risen by 21% between 2000 and 2012, versus an 8% decline in real median household income. Insurance and health care is an important factor regarding the middle-class squeeze because increases in these prices can put an added strain on middle income families. This situation is exactly what the House of Representatives survey shows regarding health care prices. In 2000, workers paid an average of $153 per month for health insurance coverage for their families, however, by 2005 these numbers had increased to $226 per month. The effects of the price change in health care can be seen in many ways regarding the middle class. The number of people who are uninsured has also increased since 2000, with 45.7 million Americans now without health insurance, compared to 38.7 million at the start of the millennium. Also, 18% of middle income Americans, making between 40,000 and 59,999 dollars were without health insurance during 2007 and more than 40% of the 2.4 million newly uninsured Americans were middle class in 2003. The rise in prices also causes a harm to working middle-class Americans because it makes it more costly for employers to cover their employees, as shown by the fact that in 2007 60% of companies offered their workers health insurance down from 69% in 2000. Also the number of Americans who reported skipping treatment due to its cost has increased from 17% to 24% during the same time period.\n\nThe Center for American Progress reported in September 2014 that the real (inflation adjusted) cost of higher education for middle-class families had risen by 62% between 2000 and 2012. The benefits of higher education are something that clearly correlates to higher income in later life, with findings showing that the average high school graduate earns $31,286, while the average college graduate makes $57,181, and education is often considered the gateway for upward mobility for the middle class. However, because of increases in college education costs, many middle-class Americans are missing out on a college education because of high prices, or caused them to leave college with massive amounts of debt, not allowing the middle class to enjoy the full benefits of a college education. Studies show that the average cost of a four-year college or university has increased by 76% since 2000, adding to this the middle class faces struggles because of decreasing financial aid. There has been no increase in government Pell grants, while at the same time interest rates for student loans has increased to a 16 year high. These price increases don't just affect middle-class Americans trying to get into college, but they also continue to affect those who attain a college education using the high interest rates of student loans. Two out of three college graduates begin their careers with student loan debt, amounting to $19,300 for the median borrower. These debts have a long-term effect on middle-class Americans, as 25% of Americans who have college debt claim it caused them to delay a medical or dental procedure and 14% report it caused them to delay their marriage.\n\nThe Center for American Progress reported in September 2014 that the real (inflation adjusted) cost of rent for middle-class families had risen by 7% between 2000 and 2012. Home-ownership is often seen as an arrival to the middle class, but recent trends are making it more difficult to continue to own a home or purchase a home. Housing prices fell dramatically following their 2006 bubble peak and remain well below this level. Many middle-class homeowners were particularly hard-hit by the crisis, as their homes were highly leveraged (e.g., purchased with a low down payment). The use of leverage magnifies gains (or losses in this case). They owe the full balance of the mortgage yet the value of the home has declined, reducing their net worth significantly.\n\nLike health care, increases in energy products can put added stress on middle-class families. Gas prices remained in the $3–$4 per gallon range from December 2010-October 2014, high by historical standards. A 2006 Congressional report stated that energy prices had risen over the 2000-2005 interval as well, including gasoline, home heating, and other forms of energy. From 2000-2005 the U.S. has seen a 52% real increase in gasoline prices, a 69% real increase in natural gas prices, a 73% real increase in heating oil costs, a 59% real increase in propane costs, and an 8% real increase in electricity cost. Overall, adjusting for inflation, this results in a cost for American families of $155 more in 2006 then they spent in 2000. Along with these direct cost increase, Americans also face indirect cost associated with higher energy prices, such as higher jet fuel prices, higher gas and diesel prices for commercial airliners, and higher natural gas prices for commercial and industrial users, and assuming these cost are passed on to consumers of these companies, it will cost the average American household $1,150 per year. Taken together these indirect and direct factors cost American middle-class families $2,360 more in 2008 than in 2000.\n\nHousehold debt contains mortgages, credit cards, student and auto loans. The ratio of household debt to GDP rose from approximately 47% GDP in 1980 and peaked at 96% GDP in 2009, driven mainly by mortgage loans, as the U.S. experienced a housing bubble. It then fell to 76% GDP in Q3 2014 due to the effects of the Great Recession as the housing bubble burst and foreclosures increased.\n\nMore than 92% of the 1.6 million Americans, who filed for bankruptcy in 2003, were middle class. Along with this, manufacturing jobs have decreased by 22% between 1998 and 2008 largely due to American businesses offshoring production (colloquially known as outsourcing).\n\nThe squeeze on the middle class is also causing difficulties when it comes to saving money for retirement because of decreased real incomes and increases in consumer prices. In 2007, 1 in 3 American workers said they hadn't saved at all for their retirement and of those who have started saving, more than half claim to have saved less than $25,000. There has also been a shift in employer retirement plans, with a shift from traditional defined benefit pension plans to 401k plans, in which there is no individual guarantee about the amount of retirement income that will be available. The percentage of workers covered by a traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plan declined steadily from 38% in 1980 to 20% in 2008. Employees in unions are more likely to be covered by a defined benefit plan, with 67% of union workers covered by such a plan during 2011 versus 13% of non-union workers.\n\nSolutions to the middle class squeeze can involve a variety of strategies, from increasing compensation to reducing costs of certain goods and services or helping the middle-class pay for them. In the U.S., the Center for American Progress (CAP) issued a report in September 2014 called \"The Middle Class Squeeze\", which identified a variety of causes and solutions.\n\nCAP recommended increasing the number of jobs through policies that stimulate economic demand, raising the minimum wage, strengthening the labor movement (including unions), and tax incentives to encourage more redistribution of corporate profits to workers. Several of these solutions are discussed in-depth in articles about U.S. income inequality and unemployment.\n\nSeveral studies have indicated that moderate increases in the minimum wage would raise the income of millions with limited effect on employment. \"The Economist\" wrote in December 2013: \"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...America's federal minimum wage, at 38% of median income, is one of the rich world's lowest. Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage.\"\n\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour between 2014 and 2016 and indexing it to inflation would reduce employment by an estimated 500,000 jobs, while about 16.5 million workers would have higher pay. A smaller increase to $9.00 per hour (without indexing) would reduce employment by 100,000, while about 7.6 million workers would have higher pay.\n\nIn the U.S., big ticket items for the middle class with costs that are growing faster than the overall rate of compensation include healthcare, childcare, college tuition, and rent. CAP recommended solutions to either directly reduce the costs of these services or help middle-class families pay for them, including education grants, debt forgiveness, more generous family leave, and free (subsidized) pre-school.\n\nAccording to a Survey on the Middle Class and Public Policy, just 38% of middle-class Americans say they live comfortably, and 77% believe that the country is headed in the wrong direction. Another 2008 report entitled \"Inside the Middle Class: Bad Times Hit the Good Life\" states that 78% of the middle class say it is more difficult now than it was five years ago. The middle class also responded that 72% believe they are economically less secure than ten years ago and almost twice the number of Americans claimed they were concerned about their personal economic stability. Showing that, overwhelmingly, the American people believe the middle class is being squeezed and are in a worse economic position than they were even 5 years ago.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1575662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1575662", "title": "Porcellian Club", "text": "Porcellian Club\n\nThe Porcellian Club is an all-male final club at Harvard University, sometimes called the Porc or the P.C. The year of founding is usually given as 1791, when a group began meeting under the name \"the Argonauts,\" or as 1794, the year of the roast pig dinner at which the club, known first as \"the Pig Club\" was formally founded. The club's motto, \"Dum vivimus vivamus\" (while we live, let us live) is Epicurean. The club emblem is the pig and some members sport golden pigs on watch-chains or neckties bearing pig's-head emblems. The club was originally started by a group of 30 students from Massachusetts who wanted to avoid the dining halls and their food by roasting pigs.\n\nThe Porcellian is the iconic \"hotsy-totsy final club,\" often bracketed with Yale's Skull and Bones, Princeton's Ivy Club, Dartmouth's Sphinx Club, Cambridge's Pitt Club, and Oxford's Bullingdon Club. A history of Harvard calls the Porcellian \"the most final of them all.\"\n\nAccording to a \"Harvard Crimson\" article of February 23, 1887:\n\nAn 1891 article from \"The Cambridge Chronicle\" recounts the early members of the club: \n\nThe Porcellian clubhouse is located at 1324 Massachusetts Avenue above the store of clothier J. August. The building was designed by the architect and clubmember William York Peters. Its entrance faces the Harvard freshman dormitories and the entrance to Harvard Yard called the Porcellian, or McKean, Gate. The gate was donated by the club in 1901 and features a limestone carving of a boar's head. Access to the clubhouse is strictly limited to members, but non-members are allowed in the first floor room known as the Bicycle Room.\n\nDespite the exclusivity and mystique, some, like \"National Review\" columnist/editor, Ronald Reagan speechwriter and Dartmouth emeritus professor of English Jeffrey Hart, have noted the club's modest physical and metaphorical character. Hart (who had never actually been inside the club) wrote:\n\nA portrait of George Washington Lewis, titled \"The Steward (Lewis of the Porcellian)\" by Joseph DeCamp, hangs in the clubhouse. An obituary in \"TIME\" magazine on April 1, 1929 notes:\n\nGeorge Washington Lewis, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, for over 45 years the esteemed Negro steward of the Porcellian Club at Harvard College; in Cambridge, Massachusetts Ancient and most esoteric of Harvard clubs is Porcellian, founded in 1791.* An oil portrait of Steward Lewis hangs in the clubhouse. Steward Lewis had ten Porcellian pallbearers.\nThe interior of the then-new clubhouse was described in an 1891 article in the \"Cambridge Chronicle\":\n\nThe enlargement of the club's library, and the fact of its growing postgraduate or honorary membership roll, compelled it from time to time to enlarge its accommodations. Finally, in 1881, it determined to tear down the old house where it had so long met, on Harvard street and build a new structure its site. The new structure is of brick, handsomely trimmed in stone, and rises to the height of four stories, with about seventy or eighty feet of frontage on Harvard street. Two large stores claim a part of the ground floor, but they do not encroach on the broad and handsome entrance to the club's apartments.\n\nThe three upper floors are used exclusively by the club. The first of them contains a large hall which opens both into the front and rear reception rooms and parlors, which, in turn, communicate. From each of these rooms a door leads to the library, which extends through from the front to the rear. On the second floor, in addition to a room over the library, there is a billiard hall in the front and a breakfast room in the rear with the kitchen over the main hall of the floor beneath. Nearly the whole of the top floor is taken up by a large banquet hall, vaulted by handsome rafters.\nTheodore Roosevelt and other members of the extended Roosevelt family belonged to the Porcellian, but the club did not invite Harvard sophomore Franklin D. Roosevelt to join. FDR joined the Fly Club instead, along with his roommate, and eventually three of his sons. According to relative Sheffield Cowles, however, FDR, in his late thirties, declared, perhaps hyperbolically, that not being \"punched\" by the Porc was \"the greatest disappointment in his life.\" Additionally, the young Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. received no invitation to join the Porc; a biographer writes that \"For years later, Joe Kennedy remembered the day he didn't make the Porcellian Club, the most desired in his mind, realizing that none of the Catholics he knew at Harvard had been selected.\"\n\nAn 1870 travel book said:\nA notice of Harvard would be as incomplete without a reference to the Porcellian Club as a notice of Oxford or Cambridge would be in which the Union Debating Society held no place. This and the Hasty Pudding Club, an organization for performing amateur theatricals, are the two lions of Harvard. The Porcellian Club is hardly a place of resort for those who cultivate the intellect at the expense of the body. The list of active members is small, owing in part to the largeness of the annual subscription. The great desire of every student is to become a member of it... the doings of the club are shrouded in secrecy... All that can be said by a stranger who has been privileged to step behind the scenes is that the mysteries are rites which can be practised without much labor and yield a pleasure which is fraught with no unpleasant consequences.\n\nA telling indication of the position of the Porcellian in the Boston establishment is given by a historian of Boston's Trinity Church, Porcellian member H. H. Richardson's architectural masterpiece. In speculating as to why Richardson was chosen, he writes, \"The thirty-four-year-old possessed one great advantage over the other candidates: as a popular Harvard undergraduate he had been a member of several clubs, including the prestigious Porcellian; thus he needed no introduction to the rector, Phillips Brooks, or five of the eleven-man building committee—they were all fellow Porcellian members.\"\n\nA biography of Norman Mailer says that when he was at Harvard, \"It would have been unthinkable... for a Jew to be invited to join one of the so-called final clubs like Porcellian, A.D. Club, Fly, or Spee.\" A history of Harvard notes the decline in Boston Brahmin influence at Harvard during the last quarter of the 1900s, and says \"a third of [the presidents of the Final Clubs] were Jewish by 1986 and one was black. The Porcellian... took an occasional Jew and in 1983 (to the horror of some elders) admitted an African-American—who had gone to St. Paul's.\"\n\nMore recent information on the membership of the Porcellian Club may be found in a 1994 Harvard Crimson article by Joseph Mathews. He writes, \"Prep school background, region and legacy status do not appear to be the sole determinants of membership they may once have been, but ... they remain factors.\"\n\nAs of 2016, the club only admitted male members, and defended “the value of single gender institutions for men and women as a supplement and option to coeducational institutions”.\n\nIn 1901 a gate to Harvard Yard, directly opposite the clubhouse, was erected. According to a notice published in the Harvard Crimson, on March 20, 1909:\n\nA gate is to be erected at the entrance to the Yard between Wadsworth House and Boylston Hall. It is to be erected by members of the Porcellian Club in memory of Joseph McKean 1794, S.T.D., LL.D. Boylston Professor of Rhetoric, Oratory and Elocution, and also the founder of the Porcellian Club.\n\nThe gate prominently features the club's symbol, a boar's head, directly above the central arch and is a famous Harvard landmark.\n\n\nAccording to a 1940 \"Time\" article:\n\nThe Pork had as members James Russell Lowell, the two famed Oliver Wendell Holmeses (the author of Autocrat of the Breakfast Table and the Supreme Court Justice), Owen Wister, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, President Theodore Roosevelt (the Franklin Roosevelts go Fly Club). Among its living members are Massachusetts' Governor Leverett Saltonstall, Congressman Hamilton Fish, Yachtsman Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, Poloist Thomas Hitchcock Jr., U. S. Ambassador to Italy William Phillips, Journalist Joseph Alsop, Richard Whitney, now of Sing Sing Prison, of whom all good Porkies prefer not to speak. The Pork is very much a family affair. Upon its roster, generation after generation, appear the same proud Boston names—Adams, Ames, Amory, Cabot, Gushing, etc. \nAccording to a note to the obituary of the Club Steward on Monday, April 1, 1929, in \"Time\" magazine:\n\nThe Porcellian roster includes Theodore Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt Jr., Poet Oliver Wendell Holmes, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Nicholas Longworth, Poet James Russell Lowell, Richard Henry (Two Years Before the Mast) Dana, Novelist Owen Wister, John Jay Chapman. The club's favorite brew is a mixture of beer and gin.\n"}

{"id": "3313658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3313658", "title": "Q'eqchi' language", "text": "Q'eqchi' language\n\nThe Q'eqchi' language, also spelled Kekchi, K'ekchi', or kekchí, is one of the Mayan languages, spoken within Q'eqchi' communities in Guatemala and Belize.\n\nThe area where Q'eqchi' is spoken spreads across northern Guatemala into southern Belize. There are also some Q'eqchi' speaking communities in Mexico.\n\nIt was calculated that the core of the Q'eqchi' speaking area in northern Guatemala extends over 24,662 square kilometers (about 9,522 square miles). The departments and specific municipalities where Q'eqchi' is regularly spoken in Guatemala include:\n\nIn the country of Belize, Q'eqchi' is spoken in the Toledo District. Q'eqchi' is the first language of many communities in the district, and the majority of Maya in Toledo speak it.\n\nTerrence Kaufman described Q'eqchi' as having two principle dialect groups: the eastern and the western. The eastern group includes the varieties spoken in the municipalities of Lanquín, Chahal, Chahabón and Senahú, and the western group is spoken everywhere else.\n\nBelow are the Q'eqchi' phonemes, represented with the International Phonetic Alphabet. To see the official alphabet, see the chart in the Orthographies section of this article.\n\nQ'eqchi' has 29 consonants, 3 of which were loaned from Spanish. \n\nQ'eqchi' has 10 vowels, which differ in quality and also in length.\n\nWith a few exceptions—interjections, such as \"uyaluy\", and adjectives which have an unstressed clitic on the end—stress always falls on the final syllable.\n\nLike many other Mayan languages, Q'eqchi' is an ergative–absolutive language, which means that the object of a transitive verb is grammatically treated the same way as the subject of an intransitive verb. Individual morphemes and morpheme-by-morpheme glosses in this section are given in IPA, while \"full words,\" or orthographic forms, are given in the ALMG orthography.\n\nThere are two kinds of pronouns in Q'eqchi': independent pronouns and pronominal affixes. The independent pronouns are much like pronouns in English or Spanish, while the pronominal affixes are attached to words such as nouns, verbs, and statives and used for inflection. Like other Mayan languages, Q'eqchi' has two sets of pronominal affixes, referred to as set A and set B. The following table provides all the pronominal affixes.\nWhen these affixes are attached to transitive verbs, set A affixes indicate the ergative agent while set B indicates the absolutive object.\nWhen a set B affix is attached to an intransitive verb, it indicates the subject of the intransitive verb.\n\nWhen an affix from set A is prefixed to a noun, it indicates possession. As their name suggests, the prevocalic forms of set A affixes are only found before vowels. However, the rules for the distribution of \"preconsonantal\" set A prefixes on nouns are more complex, and they can sometimes be found before vowels as well as consonants. For example, loan words (principally from Spanish) are found with preconsonantal affixes, regardless of whether they begin with a consonant or not. In contrast, kinship and body part words—which are words very unlikely to be loaned—always take the prevocalic prefixes if they begin with vowels. The following chart contrasts these two situations.\n\nWhen an affix of set B serves as the suffix of a stative, it indicates the subject or theme of the stative.\n\nStatives can be derived from nouns. The process simply involves suffixing the set B pronominal affix to the end of the root.\nThe basic word order of Q'eqchi' sentences is verb - object - subject, or VOS. SVO, VSO, SOV, OVS, and OSV word orders are all possible in Q'eqchi', but each have a specific use and set of restrictions. The definiteness and animacy of the subject and object can both have effects on the word order. Like many languages, the exact rules for word order in different situations vary from town to town in the Q'eqchi' speaking area.\nSeveral writing systems have been developed for Q'eqchi', but only two are in widespread use: SIL and ALMG.\n\nThe first transcriptions of Q'eqchi' in the Latin alphabet were made by Roman Catholic friars in the 16th century. Francisco de la Parra devised additional letters to represent the unfamiliar consonants of Mayan languages, and these were used to write Q'eqchi'. Examples of Q'eqchi' written with the de la Parra transcription can be seen in the 18th century writing of the Berendt-Brinton Linguistic Collection (Rare Book & Manuscript Library, University of Pennsylvania, Ms. Coll. 700). In the 20th century, before Sedat and Eachus & Carlson developed their SIL orthography, field researchers devised alternate Latin transcriptions. For example, Robert Burkitt (an anthropologist fluent in spoken Q'eqchi' and familiar with a range of Q'eqchi' communities and language variation), in his 1902 paper \"Notes on the Kekchí Language\", uses a transcription based on then-current Americanist standards.\n\nA Spanish-style orthography was developed by Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) field researchers, principally William Sedat in the 1950s and Francis Eachus and Ruth Carlson in the 1960s. This alphabet was officialized by the Guatemalan Ministry of Education through the , or the IIN. Although no longer considered standard, this orthography remains in circulation in large part due to the popularity of a few texts including the Protestant Bible produced by the SIL/Wycliffe Bible Translation Project, and a widely used language learning workbook \"Aprendamos Kekchí\".\n\nThe Proyecto Lingüístico Francisco Marroquín (PLFM) developed an alternative orthography in the late 1970s, which was influenced by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Of note, the PLFM orthography used the number \"7\" to write the glottal plosive, whereas the apostrophe was used in digraphs and trigraphs to write ejective stops and affricates. This system was later modified by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG), which replaced the \"7\" with the apostrophe. The result, the ALMG orthography, has been the standard, official way to write Q'eqchi', at least in Guatemala, since 1990. In the ALMG orthography, each grapheme (or \"letter\", including digraphs and trigraphs) is meant to correspond to a particular phoneme. These include separate vowels for long and short sounds, as well as the use of apostrophes (saltillos) for writing ejectives and the glottal stop. The following table matches each of the official ALMG graphemes with their IPA equivalents.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, Q'eqchi' was probably spoken by fewer people than neighboring languages such as Itza', Mopan, and Cholti', all of which are now moribund or extinct. The main evidence for this fact is not colonial documents, but the prevalence of loan words apparently stemming from these languages in Q'eqchi'. However, a number of factors made Q'eqchi' do better than the just-mentioned languages. One is the difficult mountainous terrain which is its home. Another is that, rather than simply being conquered, as the Cholti', or resisting conquest for an extended period, as the Itza' did for over 200 years, the Q'eqchi' came to a particular arrangement with the Spaniards, by which Dominican priests, led initially by Fray Bartolome de las Casas, were allowed to enter their territory and proselytize undisturbed, whereas no lay Spaniards were admitted. This led to their territory being renamed \"Verapaz\" (true peace) by the Spaniards, a name which continues today in the Guatemalan departments Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz. This relatively favorable early development allowed the people to spread, and even make war on neighboring Mayan groups. Although it was later followed by the brutal policies of the late-19th-century liberals and the late-20th century military governments, it largely explains the status of Q'eqchi' as the 3rd largest Mayan language in Guatemala and the 4th across the Mayan region. The relatively recent, postcolonial expansion is also the reason that Q'eqchi' is perhaps the most homogeneous of the larger Mayan languages.\n\nQ'eqchi is taught in public schools through Guatemala's intercultural bilingual education programs.\n\nLike most other Mayan languages, Q'eqchi' is still in the process of becoming a written and literary language. Existing texts can roughly be divided into the following categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As described by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, Rapid Re-Housing is a subset of the Housing First approach to end homelessness. While many Housing First programs provide rental assistance, or help clients to access rent subsidies, Rapid Re-Housing programs always provide short-term rental assistance and services, with services ending once rental assistance terminates. As with the Housing First approach, the goals are to help people obtain housing quickly, increase self-sufficiency, and remain housed. The Core Components of rapid re-housing—housing identification, rent and move-in assistance, and case management and services-operationalize Housing First principles. While Housing First programs often serve many different target populations, including youth, families with children, and the chronically homeless, Rapid Re-Housing programs generally target people with low to moderate services needs. Housing First is much broader in its approach, with program designs developed to be flexible and responsive to the complexity of human needs.\n\nSimilar to Housing First, Rapid Re-Housing is concerned with helping persons who are homeless move quickly into housing, thus minimizing the time they spend being homeless. Traditional homeless services have typically required homeless persons to move into transitional housing, wherein they participate in a program designed to make them \"ready for housing\" (such as participate in a 12 step program). Once they have completed the transitional housing program, they are assisted in moving into permanent housing. In some jurisdictions, these programs take place in homeless shelters, not transitional housing.\n\nRapid Re-Housing is based on evidence that indicates that individuals and families have better outcomes if they spend more time in permanent housing. Thus, Rapid Re-Housing concentrates on assisting homeless persons move into permanent housing before any programs are delivered.\n\nAs described by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, Rapid Re-Housing is a subset of the Housing First approach to end homelessness. Rapid Re-Housing programs are based upon the \"Housing First\" approach and the strong evidence base that stable housing promotes improved social and/or economic well-being. Experienced practitioners know that outcomes of services interventions are most successful from a stable permanent housing base. While many Housing First programs provide rental assistance, or help clients to access rent subsidies, the key difference between Rapid Re-Housing and Housing First programs is that Rapid Re-Housing always provides a short-term rent subsidy, the subsidy is time-limited and ends within 3–6 months generally, and services end when the subsidy ends. As with the Housing First approach, the goals are to help people obtain housing quickly, increase self-sufficiency, and remain housed. The Core Components of rapid re-housing — housing identification, rent and move-in assistance, and case management and services - are based upon Housing First principles.

Housing First is much broader in its approach, with program designs developed to be flexible and responsive to the complexity of human needs.\n\nWhile many practitioners of Rapid Re-Housing have been operating Housing First-based programs since the 1990s, others are fairly new to the model and prefer to apply fairly strict guidelines to determine who and for how long may be served in Rapid Re-Housing Programs. The following matrix of services needs should be utilized quite flexibly, however, as assessments of acuity conducted during episodes of homelessness often fail to consider the dramatic changes in capacity and stability that occur once homeless individuals and families are assisted in relocating to stable rental housing at rents they can afford.\n\nFor practitioners who would like a more targeted approach, the following matrix may be helpful, showing five different levels of supports available in a Rapid Re-Housing Intervention.\n"}

Established in 1905, right after the Lithuanian press ban was lifted, the society published a total of about 740 books and several periodicals, including the first full Roman Catholic Bible translation into Lithuanian in six volumes in 1911–1937. From 1918 it operated its own printing press Šviesa. The society was liquidated after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940.\n\nThe society can trace its roots to 1888 when Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas organized a secret student society, known as the Lovers of Lithuania Society (\"Lietuvos mylėtojų draugija\"), at the Kaunas Priest Seminary. At that time Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire and Lithuanian-language books we banned by the Tsarist authorities. The society had a written program which emphasized service the church and Lithuania, use of the Lithuanian language, publication of Lithuanian religious literature, and development of Lithuanian patriotism. Leaving written evidence was dangerous as its activities were illegal and the members could easily be arrested by the Tsarist police. Therefore, the society split – Tumas-Vaižgantas and nine others established a less formal society. It became known as the Society of Saint Casimir when one of its members, Paulius Šilinskas, obtained relics of Saint Casimir, patron saint of Lithuania. The society translated into Lithuanian and published several books, including a work by Irish Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, collection of gospels published by Józef Zawadzki in 1857, catechism by Roch Filochowski. At its peak as many as a third of the seminary students were its members, but the society was short-lived.\n\nThe Lithuanian press ban was lifted in 1904 and Lithuanian clergy returned to the idea of publishing religious literature in the Lithuanian language. In July 1905, about 40 priests gathered in Plungė to celebrate construction of a new church. They established a publishing company Šaltinis (stream, source), chaired by Vincentas Jarulaitis. Bishop of Samogitia approved the initiative but was dissatisfied that the organization was not based in Kaunas. Therefore, he called a meeting of about 20 members of the clergy from three dioceses (Diocese of Samogitia, Diocese of Vilnius, and Diocese of Sejny) in October 1905. The priests included , Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, Vladas Mironas, Alfonsas Petrulis. The meeting decided to establish a publishing company on 13 October 1905 in Kaunas. Its initial capital was set at 1,800 rubles and 1,200 rubles were transferred from Šaltinis.\n\nIts new chairman, , reorganized the company into a society which was officially registered on . During its first official meeting on 30 November, the society registered 178 members. With the help of Bishop Paliulionis and Cardinal Serafino Cretoni, the society obtained an indulgence from Pope Pius X on 10 April 1907. Its members were granted full indulgence on joining the society, on the feast day of Saint Casimir, on four other feasts (i.e. Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Candlemas, Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, and Nativity of Mary), and on the deathbed. A partial indulgence for seven years and seven quadragenes was granted as well for praying on certain feasts.\n\nIn the context of the Russian Revolution of 1905, the society harbored political aspirations. After the Great Seimas of Vilnius, the priests wanted to establish the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and, with the help of the society, publish \"Žiburys\" (light, beacon) magazine. However, these plans were opposed by Bishop Paliulionis and new chairman Dambrauskas-Jakštas did not adopt a political agenda.\n\nThe society started off by publishing small and cheap booklets, mostly translations. The first 13-page booklet on good confession was published in 50,000 copies and cost three kopeykas. Before 1918, the society published 231 numbered and four not numbered books. During its existence, the society published about 740 books. About a quarter of these were works of fictions. Lithuanian authors included Maironis, Vaižgantas, Lazdynų Pelėda. Other books were published on religious, scientific, popular topics. The society published the first full Roman Catholic Bible translation into Lithuanian in six volumes in 1911–1937. The translation was prepared by Archbishop Juozapas Skvireckas from the Vulgate. The society also published a textbook on the history of Lithuania by which was republished nine times in 1909–1934 and was the most widely used history textbook in interwar Lithuania. Alekna also wrote and the society published a book on the history of the church (three editions in 1919–1929) and a monograph on Bishop Motiejus Valančius (1922). It also published periodicals \"Nedėldienio skaitymai\", \"Ateitis\", \"Garnys\", \"Vienybė\", \"Žvaigždė\", \"Ganytojas\", \"Žemdirbys\", \"Draugija\", \"Rygos garsas\".\n\nThe society also organized local chapters to distribute the publications and educate local residents on Catholic values and worldview. The chapters were also active in fighting illiteracy, smoking and alcohol consumption, organizing reputable entertainment (e.g. musical performances or sport competitions). By 1914, the society had some 10,000 members. The membership peaked at about 15,000 members, of which 56% were abroad – mostly in United States but also in Italy, Poland, Palestine, Latvia. By 1939, the membership dipped to 5,000 with about 1,000 members in United States.\n\nIn 1912, the society purchased premises near the Town Hall and the Kaunas Priest Seminary (present-day Rotušės a. 23). Most of its publications were published at the printing press of Saliamonas Banaitis which was located at the same building. The society purchased this press in 1918 and renamed it Šviesa (light). The society established a book shop at its headquarters in 1913. Later, smaller book shops were opened in Vilnius (1918), Šiauliai (1919), Telšiai, Ukmergė (1921), Tauragė, Radviliškis (1922), Panevėžys, Mažeikiai (1923), Laisvės alėja, Kaunas (1925), Vilkaviškis (1931), and Plungė (1932). It also had a candle workshop which produces candles for churches and distributed goods of foreign manufacturers such as microscopes by Ernst Leitz GmbH, typewriters by the Underwood Typewriter Company, radios by Radio H. Mende GmbH.\n\nThe society was liquidated soon after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940. On 12 July, its chairman Mykolas Vaitkus was dismissed by the deputy Minister of the Interior of the People's Government of Lithuania. On 31 August, its name was changed to Raudonoji vėliava (Red Flag). The society was closed on 15 October 1940 by an order of the Council of People's Commissars of the Lithuanian SSR. Society's property was nationalized and unsold books were burned or recycled.\n\nChairmen of the Society of Saint Casimir were:\n\n"}

The White population usually speak Afrikaans as well as other European languages, most notably English.\n\nEuropean people began to immigrate into what is today the nation of Botswana in the 19th century, starting with the Boer people. The Dorsland Trek in the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw thousands of Boer families migrate from South Africa to present-day Namibia by way of Botswana. Many families stayed, especially in Ghanzi, which is in the Kalahari Desert. White Tswana people come from a variety of backgrounds, including families of British, Boer, German, and Greek descent. \n\nAdditionally, there is a fairly significant Serbian community in the country, mainly families of immigrants from Yugoslavia who came beginning in the 1950s. There is a Serbian Society in Gaborone, which regularly hosts a variety of cultural events. In 2016 construction began on the first Serbian Orthodox church in Botswana, the St. Nicholas Church.\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"Zeliangrong\" refers to the Zeme, Liangmai and Rongmei Naga tribes combined together. Earlier, the term also covered the Inpui tribe. The proper noun Zeliangrong does not denote a tribe but, rather, a union of tribes or, rather, the apex tribe of three aforementioned tribes (Zeme Naga, Liangmai Naga, Rongmei Naga).\n\nThe descendants of Hoi of Makuilongdi (Makhel) were divided and were made peripheral appendages to three political entities - Manipur, Naga Hills (Nagaland) and the North Cachar District of Assam.\n\nThe Zeliangrongs number around four hundred and fifty thousand according to the 2011 census, though their population may actually number around five hundred thousand in the three states of Assam, Manipur and Nagaland. The Zeliangrong may be classified as an ethno-cultural entity. The Zeliangrong belong to the larger Southern Mongoloid population and their language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family of languages.\n\nThe Zeliangrong have been living in the present location of their land since time immemorial, in a compact and contiguous geographical setting of approximately 12,000 km lying between 93 degrees E and 94 degree E longitude and 94.40 degrees and 24 degrees N latitude in N. C Hills of Assam; Peren district of Nagaland; Tamenglong district, Sardar hills of Senapati district, northern part Henglep subdivision of Churachanpur district, Jiribam subdivision of Imphal district, Imphal valley and Silchar Town along with various villages such as Binnakandi, Lakhipur, and its adjoining slopes in Manipur.\n\nThe ethnonym ‘Zeliangrong’ is traced back to the three kindred brothers. The three brothers are the \"Zeme\" (dwellers of the warmer) or \"Mejahme\" (lower region), \"Liangmai\" (men of the North) the original Northerner; on the other hand the term \"Rongmei\" (people settled in the south) and finally Inpui (Puimei). The word \"Zeliangrong\" was first coined on 15 February 1947 at Keishamthong Imphal. The terminology Zeliangrong was coined in coherence with the solidarity movement after India’s independence. The Zeme, Liangmei and Rongmei dominates the demography in the districts of Peren in Nagaland, Tamenglong in Manipur, Haflong and other parts of North Cachar Hills in Assam. Not to forget the parts of the Barak Valley, Kohima the capital of Nagaland, Dimapur the commercial hub of Nagaland, Loktak, Bishnupur also Imphal the capital of Manipur comes under the fold of Zeliangrong people.\n\n\n"}
