The party was founded by Abdul Wali Khan in 1986 and its current president is Asfandyar Wali Khan, grandson of Bacha Khan, with Tajuddin Khan serving as the Secretary-General. Part of the PPP-led cabinet of the Pakistani government during 2008−13, the ANP's political position is considered left wing, advocating for secularism, democratic socialism, public sector government, and economic egalitarianism.\n\nANP was the largest Pashtun nationalist party in Pakistan between 2008−2013 with influence lying in the Pashtun dominated areas in and around Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. They governed the province from 2008-2013 but lost to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in the general election of 2013.\n\nKhan Abdul Wali Khan's political career had been built on the tradition of intense Pashtun nationalism inherited from his father, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (Bacha Khan). Although it was formed after the partition of India but most of the leaders were Pro-India, and were against the creation of Pakistan. Most of the leaders were used to congress right hands before the independence. Both men were opposed to the creation of Pakistan, and after the proclamation of independence of Pakistan in 1947, they were imprisoned. In 1956 Wali Khan joined the National Awami Party (NAP), led by a charismatic Bengali socialist, Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani. In 1965 the NAP split into two factions, with Wali Khan becoming president of the pro-Moscow faction. The party's members participated in 1970 parliamentary elections through the Pakistan Peoples Party's platform and the National Awami Party, forming a largest socialist alliance with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1970. However, the alliance fell apart and its members joined the Pakistan National Alliance.\n\nIn 1972 the party was strong enough to form coalition provincial governments, with its partner the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. These governments were short lived. Wali Khan was again jailed, and his party was barred from politics when the Supreme Court upheld the finding of President Bhutto that the NAP was conspiring against the state of Pakistan. General Zia-ul-Haq subsequently withdrew the charges against the NAP. Wali Khan was released, joined the National Democratic Party, and ultimately formed the Awami National Party. In the meantime, President Bhutto was imprisoned and executed in April 1979.\n\nThe Awami National Party (awami means \"people's\"), which depends on ethnic Pashtuns (Pukhtuns) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly NWFP) and northern Balochistan as its political base, was formed in 1986 by the merger of several left-leaning parties including the Awami Tehrik and the National Democratic Party.\n\nThe National Democratic Party merged with several other progressive political and nationalist groups to form the Awami National Party. Wali Khan, the influential Pashtun and Soviet-backed leader, was elected as its first president and Sindhi socialist Rasul Bux Palejo was appointed its first secretary general. From 1986 to 1988, the ANP party was a member of the Movement for Restoration of Democracy.\n\nSince its inception, the ANP has been an important ally of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). The party formed a coalition government with the PPP in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and in Sindh province and Islamabad for central government after the Pakistani parliamentary elections in 1988. This alliance, however, collapsed in April 1989 after differences cropped up between the two parties, after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ordered a military action that brutally failed. The Awami National Party later formed an alliance with the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) in early June 1989 which led to a formal split in the party with many activists allying with the PPP.\n\nAfter the election of Nawaz Sharif in 1990, the ANP again formed a coalition with former rivals PML. This alliance proved longer lasting, surviving till 1998 when it collapsed over differences over the building of Kalabagh Dam and renaming the province NWFP to Pakhtunkhwa. It won six seats in the National Assembly in the 1990 elections. In the 1993 national elections, the party won three seats in the National Assembly. It then joined the Grand Democratic Alliance, campaigning against the Sharif government's policies. After Nawaz Sharif's overthrow by Pervez Musharraf, the party stayed an active member of the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy, until the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States, when it left the alliance over supporting NATO's ouster of the Taliban government. The party's reputation was damaged in this period following the arrest of former Federal Minister and senior party leader Azam Khan Hoti.\n\nIn the 2002 elections the party struck up an alliance with the PPP. However, both parties were electorally routed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the religion-political alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) riding on a wave of anti-American sentiment in Pakistan.\n\nIn the 2008 parliamentary elections, the ANP dominated the far-right wing coalition, the MMA, a party formed by coalition of Islamic movements in 2002. The ANP has also won provincial seats in Balochistan and in Sindh for the first time in 15 years. It formed a coalition government with the Pakistan People's Party in all three provinces. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the ANP has its first chief minister since 1948.\n\nThe strongholds of the ANP are in the Pashtun dominated areas of Pakistan, particularly in the Mardan area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and it has traditionally dominated Charsadda, Mardan, Nowshera, Peshawar, and Swabi areas of central KPK. On the other hand, the city of Karachi in Sindh province hosts one of the largest Pashtun populations in the world, but the ANP only had 2 seats in 2011, whereas the number of Pashtuns present would predict them having \"up to 25 seats\".\n\nIn May 2008, Asfandyar Wali Khan made an unannounced visit to the United States in which he and his delegate held high-level meetings with top U.S. officials. A source explained that \"the delegation is here as part of a visitors programme that brings important people from other nations for meeting US civil and military officials and members of the civic society.\" This was Wali Khan's second such visit to the United States, a country where he has several relatives.\n\nIn the last decade, hundreds of members of the ANP have been assassinated or became victims of target killings. Most of the attacks occurred in the Karachi and Peshawar areas. An ANP rally in Quetta was subject to a bomb blast on 13 July 2012. The blast killed six people and injured 12 others. It was speculated that a cycle parked behind the stage was the probable cause. The dead included two children as well.\n\nThe party has also accused Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan and of being complicit in the Taliban attacks.\n\nOn 10 July 2018, during the Pakistani general election, 2018 there was a suicide bombing attack on political rally of Awami National Party (ANP) in YakaToot neighborhood of Peshawar in which fourteen people were killed and sixty five injured. Among the killed was ANP's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly candidate, Haroon Bilour. Bilour was son of Bashir Ahmad Bilour who was also killed in a suicide bombing attack in December 2012. Elections for Constituency PK-78 were postponed to an disclosed date by the Election Commission.\n\nThe party espouses a nonviolent approach to tackling extremism. It promotes democratic socialism, secularism, economic egalitarianism, and Pashtun nationalism. The party has dense support among the Pashtun population in the country. Since 2000, its liberal socialism and pro-Pashtun philosophy has become the integral part of the party, advocating for the regional autonomy and increased Pashtun cultural expression. A frequent coalition partner in provincial politics, it was routed in the 2002 elections because of its opposition to the Taliban and support for the NATO-backed Karzai administration in neighboring Afghanistan.\n\nIt joined the opposition All Parties Democratic Movement, and along with other parties except the Pakistan Peoples Party resigned from Parliament in October 2007 in protest against the military regime of Pervez Musharraf. It was targeted in 2007 and 2008 by presumed supporters of the Taliban. Despite the attacks, the party has advocated dialogue with moderate tribal elements to end the violence in the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas.\n\nThe Awami National Party is one of the few parties in Pakistan to hold a system of regular internal general elections every four-year period.\n\n\n\n"}

Like the Paraiyar of the neighboring Tamil ethnic group in Sri Lanka as well as Tamil Nadu state in South India they were segregated from the mainstream society yet played and still play an important and vital role in the religious rituals of the mainstream community.\n\nAs the mainstream Sinhalese speakers claim North Indian ethnic origins the presence of many South Indian type Jatis like the Beravas indicate a complex migration history from India to Sri Lanka. Beravas do not indicate any tribal origins like the other formerly untouchable caste of Rodiyas. They are part and parcel of the caste structure albeit with a primary function associated with Tom Tom or drum besting in all ritual occasions. Yet they are also used as agricultural workers, weavers and domestic help throughout the country.\n\nSome anthropologists believe that the early society of Sri Lanka has looked to neighboring South India for manpower to fulfill functional needs as land was cleared and many new villages found. Berava are believed to be descended from Paraiyar like caste of South India who also play an important role in Tom Tom or Drum or Bera beating\n\nThe powerful Mudaliyar class created by the British in the 19th century attempted to keep this caste and all other Sri Lankan castes out of colonial appointments. They also used all possible means to economically and socially marginalise and subjugate all other communities. The oppression by the Mudaliars and connected headmen extended to demanding subservience, service, appropriation of cultivation rights and even restrictions on the type of personal names that could be used by this community. Continuous oppression and prejudices created by the Buddhist monastic establishment has made it difficult for this community to progress.\n\nThe etymology of the word Bera for Drum in Sinhalese is derived from after the Tamil word \"Parai\" which originally meant \"speak\" came to denote a \"drumming\" caste. Thus this etymology indicates that Berava were a late addition to the Sinhalese Society.\n\nThere are many subdivisions within the caste, some of which are \"Badgam Berava\" and \"Gahala Berava\" indicating drumming specializations. They denote Temple drummers who occupied and cultivated \"Bathgam\" (rice producing villages) as tenant farmers and Executioner's drummers respectively. It may indicate diverse origins for this caste as for all castes in India.\n\nAlthough great many Sinhalese purport to profess the conservative Theravada Buddhism there is a thriving belief in demons, spirits, Hindu gods and connected rituals such as spirit possession, cursing ceremonies throughout the country also referred as the Spirit Religion or Folk Tradition. Some of these are facilitated by shamans, sorcerers and native priests and astrologers. Berava perform the needed role as sorceress in some villages and also gain respectability by building cultic shrines to attract devotees from other castes.\n\n\n"}

The majority of Black Canadians are of Caribbean origin, though the population also includes African American immigrants and their descendants (including Black Nova Scotians), as well as many African immigrants.\n\nList of census subdivisions in the Montreal area with Black populations higher than the national average\nSource: Canada 2016 Census\n\n\nOne of the most famous Black-dominated urban neighbourhoods in Montreal is Little Burgundy, regarded as the spiritual home of Canadian jazz due to its association with many of Canada's most influential early jazz musicians. In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, LaSalle, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, and Montréal-Nord have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population.\n\nThe first recorded black person to set foot on land now known as Canada was a free man named Mathieu de Costa. Travelling with navigator Samuel de Champlain, de Costa arrived in Nova Scotia some time between 1603 and 1608 as a translator for the French explorer Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts. The first known black person to live in what would become Canada was a slave from Madagascar named Olivier Le Jeune, who may have been of partial Malay ancestry. As a group, black people arrived in Canada in several waves. The first of these came as free persons serving in the French Army and Navy, though some were enslaved or indentured servants.\n\nAn enslaved woman, Marie-Joseph Angélique was tried and convicted of setting fire to her owner's home, burning much of what is now referred to as Old Montreal in 1734.\n\nMany of Canada's railway porters were recruited from the U.S., with many coming from the South, New York City, and Washington, D.C. They settled mainly in the major cities of Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver, which had major rail connections. In Montreal, they settled primarily in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood. The railroads were considered to have good positions, with steady work and a chance to travel.\n\nTo combat poverty and social exclusion, the nascent black community of Little Burgundy founded numerous social organizations: the Women's Coloured Club of Montreal in 1902, the Union United Congregational Church in 1907, and the Negro Community Center in 1927.\n\nThe neighbourhood became famous for producing several talented jazz musicians. During Prohibition and the later pre-Jean Drapeau years as an 'open city,' Little Burgundy was home to many lively nightclubs featuring homegrown and international performers; one of them was Rockhead's Paradise, owned by Rufus Rockhead, after whom a street is named. Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones are the two best-known musicians who emerged from the bebop and post-bop era.\n\nIn 1968 the Sir George Williams affair occurred as a result of racist policies at Sir George Williams University.\n\nWest Indian women, from both the Francophone and Anglophone Caribbean, came to Montreal after the Domestic Immigration Program of 1955 was established. Most settled in Little Burgundy.\n\nCanada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial rules were eliminated from the immigration laws. This coincided with the dissolution of the British Empire in the Caribbean. Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbeans came from that region, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada; they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. Today's Black Canadians are largely of Caribbean origin, with some of recent African origin, and smaller numbers from the United States, Europe and Latin America.\n\nMontreal's Haitian community of 100,000 people is the largest in Canada. Large percentages of Haitians live in Montréal-Nord,\nSaint-Michel and R.D.P. Today, Haitian Creole is the sixth most spoken language in Montreal and the seventh most spoken language in the province of Quebec.\n\nCarifiesta () is an annual Caribbean Carnival held in Montreal. The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent.\n\nThe Montreal Black Film Festival is held annually.\n\nBlack Canadians have had a major influence on Canadian music, helping pioneer many genres including Canadian hip hop, Canadian blues, Canadian jazz, R&B, Caribbean music, pop music and classical music. Some of the earliest musical influences include Oliver Jones, Oscar Peterson and Charlie Biddle.\n\nBecause the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of \"creating\" a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture. For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been ensemble cast comedy or drama series centred around the creation and/or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution.\n\n\nThe Community Contact is a newspaper serving Montreal's Black and Caribbean Community. Black Wealth Matters is a web series addressing issues in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This may have been through increased productivity, expansion of markets, providing more jobs, or acts of philanthropy. This characterisation contrasts with that of the robber baron, a business leader using political means to achieve personal ends.\n\nSome 19th-century industrialists who were called \"captains of industry\" overlap with those called \"robber barons\". These include people such as J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, Andrew W. Mellon, Henry Ford, and John D. Rockefeller. The term was coined by Thomas Carlyle in his 1843 book, \"Past and Present\".\n\nThe education division of the National Endowment for the Humanities has prepared a lesson plan for schools asking whether \"robber baron\" or \"captain of industry\" is the better terminology. The lesson states that it attempts to help students \"establish a distinction between robber barons and captains of industry. Students will uncover some of the less honorable deeds as well as the shrewd business moves and highly charitable acts of the great industrialists and financiers. It has been argued that only because such people were able to amass great amounts of capital could our country become the world's greatest industrial power.

{"id": "1538431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1538431", "title": "Church of the Universe", "text": "Church of the Universe\n\nThe Assembly of the Church of the Universe, an entheogen religion, was established by Walter Tucker in 1969 in the Canadian province of Ontario. The Church uses marijuana as a sacrament and promotes nudity as a demonstration of human honesty.\n\nThe guiding rules of the church are variations on the Golden Rule:\n\nAlthough often quoting from the Bible and other scriptures, the church denies a direct connection to Christianity. It also accepts as valid sources of inspiration ancient and modern sources such as the culture of Sumer, pagan holidays of the solstices, Canada Day, the Knights Templar, Chaldeans, Gnostic Gospels and the Desiderata.\n\nTheir sacrament is cannabis, and followers are encouraged to smoke it and use hemp products. They draw on accounts in Genesis and associate the Tree of Life with the hemp plant, additionally quoting Psalm 22:30 and Revelation 22:2,14.\n\nNudity also finds its origins in Genesis, since Adam and Eve were unclothed until they ate from the Tree of Knowledge rather than the Tree of Life. However, members are enjoined to cover their heads on any official occasion or when interacting with government agents. Each person is encouraged to do so as God directs. Nudism is no longer practiced in many communities within the Church of the Universe.\n\nSince all members joining the church are simultaneously considered to be ordained as ministers, there is theoretically no distinction made between \"clergy\" and \"ordinary members\". However, founder Walter Tucker and leading member Michael Baldasaro have partially developed a system of structured religious titles derived from Catholic Christianity, such as reverend, archbishop, bishop and abbot.\n\nTucker founded the church at a water-filled former quarry in Puslinch, Ontario in Wellington County between Hamilton and Guelph in 1969. After he leased the site for a nominal fee, he renamed it \"Clearwater Abbey\".\n\nClearwater Abbey's presence in the area was not without controversy, including allegations of noisy ceremonies on the property, the discovery nearby of human remains in 1975, the termination of its lease in 1982, and the final forcible removal of members from the property by police and sheriffs. An attempt to relocate to a disused foundry, renamed \"Hempire Village\", in Guelph in 1994 met a similar fate. The church is now located in north Hamilton.\n\nThe church's ritual use of cannabis and its occasional practice of nudism has attracted attention from both the media and police. Because of members regular possession and use of cannabis as a sacrament, legal charges of criminal possession and trafficking in marijuana laid against individual members are a common occurrence.\n\nFrequent court challenges, based on charges or the exercise of political rights, have created an additional pair of intertwined activities: the Legal Self-Defence fund and the University of Universe. Members who defend themselves or others in court are granted degrees from this non-accredited university, the level depending on the level of court involved.\n\nIn the past, both Baldasaro and Tucker have utilized political candidacy for various public and party offices as a platform for espousing their religious beliefs.\n\n\nStories in local newspapers such as \"The Hamilton Spectator\" and \"The Guelph Mercury\" on the church and its members do not remain online for long. The following links have been chosen for their stability on the web.\n"}
{"id": "5070772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5070772", "title": "Classical Tibetan", "text": "Classical Tibetan\n\nClassical Tibetan refers to the language of any text written in Tibetic after the Old Tibetan period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day, it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially Sanskrit. The phonology implied by Classical Tibetan orthography is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the grammar varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic.\n\nIn 816, during the reign of King Sadnalegs, literary Tibetan underwent a thorough reform aimed at standardizing the language and vocabulary of the translations being made from Indian texts, which resulted in what is now called Classical Tibetan.\n\nNominalizing suffixes — \"pa\" or \"ba\" and \"ma\" — are required by the noun or adjective that is to be singled out;\n\nThe plural is denoted, when required, by adding the morpheme \"-rnams\", when the collective nature of the plurality is stressed the morpheme \"-dag\" is instead used. These two morphemes combine readily (e.g. \"rnams-dag\" 'a group with several members', and \"dag-rnams\" 'several groups').\n\nThe classical written language has ten cases.\n\n\nCase morphology is affixed to entire noun phrases, not to individual words (i.e. \"Gruppenflexion\").\n\nTraditional Tibetan grammarians do not distinguish case markers in this manner, but rather distribute these case morphemes (excluding \"-dang\" and \"-bas\") into the eight cases of Sanskrit.\n\nThere are personal, demonstrative, interrogative and reflexive pronouns, as well as an indefinite article, which is plainly related to the numeral for \"one.\"\n\nAs an example of the pronominal system of classical Tibetan, the \"Milarepa rnam thar\" exhibits the following personal pronouns.\n\nLike in French, the plural (vous / ཁྱེད་ \"khyed\") can be used a polite singular.\n\nVerbs do not inflect for person or number. Morphologically there are up to four separate stem forms, which the Tibetan grammarians, influenced by Sanskrit grammatical terminology, call the \"present\" (\"lta-da\"), \"past\" (\"'das-pa\"), \"future\" (\"ma-'ongs-pa\"), and \"imperative\" (\"skul-tshigs\"), although the precise semantics of these stems is still controversial. The so-called future stem is not a true future, but conveys the sense of necessity or obligation.\n\nThe majority of Tibetan verbs fall into one of two categories, those that express implicitly or explicitly the involvement of an agent, marked in a sentence by the instrumental particle (\"kyis\" etc) and those that express an action that does not involve an agent. Tibetan grammarians refer to these categories as \"tha-dad-pa\" and \"tha-mi-dad-pa\" respectively. Although these two categories often seem to overlap with the English grammatical concepts of transitive and intransitive, most modern writers on Tibetan grammar have adopted the terms \"voluntary\" and \"involuntary\", based on native Tibetan descriptions. Most involuntary verbs lack an imperative stem.\n\nMany verbs exhibit stem ablaut among the four stem forms, thus \"a\" or \"e\" in the present tends to become \"o\" in the imperative \"byed\", \"byas\", \"bya\", \"byos\" ('to do'), an \"e\" in the present changes to \"a\" in the past and future (\"len\", \"blangs\", \"blang\", \"longs\" 'to take'); in some verbs a present in \"i\" changes to \"u\" in the other stems (\"'dzin\", \"bzung\", \"gzung\", \"zung\" 'to take'). Additionally, the stems of verbs are also distinguished by the addition of various prefixes and suffixes, thus \"sgrub\" (present), \"bsgrubs\" (past), \"bsgrub\" (future), \"sgrubs\" (imperative). Though the final -\"s\" suffix, when used, is quite regular for the past and imperative, the specific prefixes to be used with any given verb are less predictable; while there is a clear pattern of \"b\"- for a past stem and \"g\"- for a future stem, this usage is not consistent.\n\nOnly a limited number of verbs are capable of four changes; some cannot assume more than three, some two, and many only one. This relative deficiency is made up by the addition of auxiliaries or suffixes both in the classical language and in the modern dialects.\n\nVerbs are negated by two prepositional particles: \"mi\" and \"ma\". \"Mi\" is used with present and future stems. The particle \"ma\" is used with the past stem; prohibitions do not employ the imperative stem, rather the present stem is negated with \"ma\". There is also a negative stative verb \"med\" 'there is not, there does not exist', the counterpart to the stative verb \"yod\" 'there is, there exists'\n\nAs with nouns, Tibetan also has a complex system of honorific and polite verbal forms. Thus, many verbs for everyday actions have a completely different form to express the superior status, whether actual or out of courtesy, of the agent of the action, thus \"lta\" 'see', hon. \"gzigs\"; \"byed\" 'do', hon. \"mdzad\". Where a specific honorific verb stem does not exist, the same effect is brought about by compounding a standard verbal stem with an appropriate general honorific stem such as \"mdzad\".\n\n\n\n"}

Civil liberty and human rights groups immediately questioned the constitutionality and stated that the provisions were so broad that they could be applied to non-terrorists, witnesses and detainees. The bureau appeared to abandon the program, but on December 11, 2006, a Communication Management Unit (CMU) was quietly implemented at Indiana's Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute. \"From April to June 2010, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) opened up a period for public comment around the establishment of two Communications Management Units\" with several civil rights groups and advocates \"coming together to urge the federal Bureau of Prisons to close the experimental prison units.\" It is unclear who authorized the program; it was either the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel, FBOP Director Harley Lappin or United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.\n\nCompared to other inmates, those placed in the CMU have little contact with the outside world. At least $14 million is spent on surveillance of the CMUs. A counterterrorism team in West Virginia monitors verbal communication remotely.\n\nThe CMU permits two hours, twice per month, and no contact, meaning the visitor and inmate are in separate rooms with viewing through a glass window and talking via telephone. All conversations must be in English unless special permission is granted 10 days in advance. In addition to the already imposed restrictions, CMU \"prisoners are banned from any physical contact with visiting friends and family, including babies, infants, and minor children.\"\n\nNon-CMU prisoners can usually send and receive unlimited mail, where incoming mail is checked for contraband, then delivered to the inmate. With the exception of correspondence with lawyers and the courts, letters sent to and from the CMU are read, copied and evaluated before being released, which results in delays of a week or more.\n\nConvicts in the general population are permitted 300 phone minutes per month; rules in the CMU allow one call per week, limited to 15 minutes, and it must be in English unless special permission is granted 10 days in advance. The duration of the single call can be reduced to 3 minutes at the discretion of the warden.\n\nOn February 25, 2007, the \"Washington Post\" reported the creation of a medium security \"Communication Management Unit\" housing 213 inmates in Terre Haute. The staff monitors all telephone calls and mail, and requires that all inmate conversations occur in English unless special permission is arranged for conversations in other languages.\nIt was physically situated in the former death row section, and all but two of the inmates are Arab Muslims, leading the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to raise a concern about racial profiling. The ACLU also charged that the communication restrictions are unduly harsh for prisoners who are not sufficiently serious security threats to warrant placement in ADX Florence, the Supermax facility in Colorado.\n\nCurrent inmates include \"American Taliban\" John Walker Lindh, the Lackawanna Six, Rafil A. Dhafir, Enaam Arnaout, and Kirksey Nix.\n\nAlthough the Supermax facility is gone, the United States Penitentiary, Marion, in 2008 became home to the other known \"Communication Management Unit\" in the federal prison system. The inmates are predominantly Arab Muslims, but it once housed Daniel McGowan, after his involvement in two arsons at logging operations in Oregon. His sentence was given \"terrorism enhancements\" as authorized by the USA PATRIOT Act.\n\nAnimal Liberation Front prisoner Abdul Haqq, whose legal name is Walter Edmund Bond and whose birth name was Walter Edmund Zuehlke was held at USP Marion CMU from January 2012 to March 2015. Abdul Haqq is serving 12 years and 3 months for 3 counts of arson in relation to the Animal Liberation Front.\n\nCommunication Management Unit also houses Richard Scutari, a former leader of the white supremacist revolutionary group, The Order. Scutari was sentenced to a 60-year prison term in 1985. He was moved to the USP Marion CMU in July 2008.\nAn ACLU lawsuit charges that CMUs of the federal prisons violate inmates' rights. In a Democracy Now interview on June 25, 2009, animal rights activist Andrew Stepanian, a member of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC), talked about being jailed at the CMU. Stepanian is believed to be the first prisoner released from a CMU.\n\nA 2011 story by NPR reported 50 units and 71 inmates at CMUs. It also described open cells, and a basketball court.

{"id": "42415226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42415226", "title": "Conceptual combination", "text": "Conceptual combination\n\nConceptual combination is a fundamental cognitive process by which two or more existing basic concepts are mentally synthesized to generate a composite, higher-order concept. The products of this process are sometimes referred to as \"complex concepts.\" Combining concepts allows individuals to use a finite number of concepts which they already understand to construct a potentially limitless quantity of new, related concepts. It is an essential component of many abilities, such as perception, language, synthetic reasoning, creative thought and abstraction.\n\nConceptual combination is an important concept in the fields of cognitive psychology and cognitive science.\n\nThe mechanism by which conceptual combination occurs is debatable, both on cognitive and neurological levels. As such, multiple models have been developed or applied to better define how the process occurs.\n\nCognitive models attempt to functionally outline the mental computation involved in conceptual combination. \n\nConstraint theory stipulates that the concept that results from an attempt at conceptual combination is controlled by three constraints known as diagnosticity, plausibility and informativeness. \"Diagnosticity\" refers to the a complex concept's possession of the defining properties of its component simple concepts. Because such properties are diagnostic of the component concepts, at least some of them should be diagnostic of the higher-order representations constructed from those concepts. \"Plausibility\" refers to consistency with existing knowledge and prior experience. It is based on the assumption that a complex concept should be reasonably relevant to the context in which it is used. This assumption makes the most sense in a practical, linguistic context, particularly when a speaker is catering to the understanding of the listener. \"Informativeness\" is the property of having more meaning or properties than any individual component. If a complex concept were not distinguishable from any given component, it would be identical to that component. Because nothing can logically be both a component of something and the totality of something simultaneously, a complex concept must at least be the sum of its parts. Many argue that the interaction among component concepts should allow a complex concept to be greater than that sum. If multiple possible ways to structure or interpret a complex concept exist, the one which best satisfies or most satisfies these constraints is the one which will be used. The paradigm upon which constraint theory is based is computational, and therefore views the mind as a processor which operates on the basis of standard problem-solving protocols (i.e. algorithms and heuristics).\n\nThe spreading activation model is a model in connectionist theory sometimes designed to represent how concepts are activated in relation to one another. Though it is typically applied to information search processes like recognition, brainstorming, and recall, it can be used to explain how concepts are combined as well as connected.\n\nSpreading activation models represent memory and knowledge as a network of interlinked concepts. Every concept manifests as a node within this network, with related nodes/concepts linked to one another with connections. Concepts that are more strongly associated with one another either in terms of content or an individual's past experience are correspondingly more strongly linked.\n\nWhen one concept is employed in working memory, the corresponding node is also activated. This activation spreads through the node's links, making it easier to activate nodes to which the activated node is connected. This spreading activation stimulates the linked nodes, pressuring them to activate to an extent proportional to the strength of the connection between the stimulating node and the stimulated node. If sufficient net stimulation is accrued through a stimulated node's links, it will also activate. Thus, being connected to an activated node makes it easier for an inactive node to become active as well; concepts become more readily accessed when individuals are stimulated with related concepts first. This increase in ease of access is known as \"priming.\"\n\nSpreading activation models tend to imply that processing concepts occurs in series; that is, each concept is processed one-at-a-time, one after the other. As such, individuals tend to combine concepts more readily, easily, and quickly if they are more closely linked within the network of concepts. This implication, however, has caused spreading activation to come under a great deal of criticism, particularly with respect to how the concept is employed in feature theories.\n\nThe features and properties of complex concepts are generally assumed to be derived from the simple concepts that compose them. One popularly discussed model involves a two-stage serial process. In the initial stage, features from each of the component simple concepts are retrieved from memory through spreading activation. This allows a complex concept to accrue features with existing relationships with its component simple concepts. During this stage, the basic definition of what the complex concept is and/or means is generates. In the second stage, knowledge and reasoning are employed upon the features accrued in the previous stage to generate further features. For example, one might reason that the complex concept \"white jacket,\" if worn in a blizzard, would make one difficult to see; it would follow that one should ascribe the property of \"good for winter camouflage,\" despite the fact that this property is not closely attached to the component concepts \"white\" nor \"jacket.\" This stage is especially useful when properties of complex concepts contradict those of their component concepts, such as the different colours of milk and chocolate milk.\n\nThis model, however, has come under criticism due to its inconsistency with empirical studies. If conceptual combination employed serial spreading activation, for instance, it should take longer to verify the properties of complex concepts, as they necessarily possess more concepts than their component simple concepts. Research has nonetheless shown that it takes less time to confirm complex concepts' properties than their components and about equal time to reject false properties for both. This occurred even when the properties of the complex concept contradicted those of the simple concepts. Likewise, when experiment participants are exposed to a set of features first, and then asked to verify whether or not they correspond to simple or complex concepts, the participants tend to provide correct verification answers for the complex concepts more quickly.\n\nThe neurological basis of conceptual combination has received considerably less attention than its cognitive basis. Nevertheless, research has revealed several specific brain regions that are intimately involved if not entirely responsible for neural processing involved in conceptual combination.\n\nOf particular relevance is the left anterior temporal lobe. Studies have previously demonstrated an additive effect for stimulation in this subsection of neural cortex tissue. When experiment participants were verbally presented with certain simple concepts, the processing of the information causes electrical stimulation in the region. When the same participants were verbally presented with a single complex concept formed from the combination of the aforementioned simple concepts, the stimulation recorded was equivalent to the sum of the stimulation that resulted from each individual component simple concept. In other words, the stimulation caused by a complex concept is equivalent to the total stimulation caused by its component concepts. More recent data contradicts those results by indicating a multiplicative effect in which the activation caused by a complex concept is the product of the activation levels caused by its component concepts, rather than the sum.\n\nFurther support for the role of the left anterior temporal lobe has been previously established through neuropsychological studies. Semantic dementia is a disorder in which conceptual manipulation, including conceptual combination, is hindered. These indicate that the neural damage associated with semantic dementia occurs within this brain region. Unfortunately, neuropsychological studies that attempt to replicate this pattern have failed, leading uncertainty as to whether initial results were valid.\n\nAs language is the means by which concepts are communicated and expressed, the processed involved in linguistic expression and interpretation are heavily intertwined with combined concepts. Many theories of concept combination mechanisms, including constraint theory were developed within the context of language, and therefore make more sense when applied in a linguistic context. Study into the linguistic aspects of concept combination as has generally been focused on the interpretation mechanism.\n\nA concept that can be expressed using a single word is called a \"lexical concept.\" A lexical concept is usually treated as a basic concept, although it can just as easily be a complex concept.\n\nTwo lexical concepts are often used together as phrases to represent a combined concept of greater specificity. This is most readily seen in the use of adjectives to modify nouns and the use of adverbs to modify verbs and adjectives. Consider, for example, phrases such as \"burnt toast,\" \"eat roughly,\" and \"readily loved.\" Multiple noun lexical concepts can also be used together in order to represent combined concepts. Through this process, a limited pool of nouns can be used to produce an exponentially larger pool of phrases such as \"sound wave,\" \"video game,\" and \"sleeping pill.\"\n\nIn addition to constraint theory, there are two principal theories surrounding the mechanism by which noun-noun combinations are interpreted. The first of these is \"dual-process theory.\" Dual-process theory proposed that there are two means by which people interpreted noun-noun phrases. \"Relational interpretation\" attempts to establish a relationship between the nouns and interprets the combined phrase in terms of that relationship. For example, one might relationally interpret the phrase \"snake mouse\" to refer to a mouse meant to be eaten by snakes, as the two concepts have a predatory relationship. \"Property interpretation\" identifies properties associated with the first noun and then applies them onto the second noun. In this case the phrase \"snake mouse\" might be interpreted as a mouse with poisonous fangs or an elongated body.\n\nThe second principal theory is known as the \"Competition in Relations among Nominals\" theory. It states that the assumed modification effect of a noun on its partner in a novel noun-noun combination is the one which it has been seen to employ most often in the past. For example, \"chocolate cat\" is usually interpreted as \"a cat made of chocolate\" rather than \"a chocolate-eating cat\" simply because the \"made of\" modifier is heavily conditioned to be associated with \"chocolate.\"\n\nExplanations of linguistic expression of complex concepts have been linked to spreading activation models. When an individual identifies a lexical concept through vision or hearing, the corresponding node in that individual's cognitive network is said to activate. This makes it easier for lexical concepts linked to the activated concept to be comprehended, as they are primed. This is consistent with current empirical data, which shows that when individuals are interpreting sentences, they process the linguistic content more quickly when several related words follow one another. In turn, it becomes easier for people to combine these related concepts together and understand them as a relationship, rather than two distinct entities. For example, consider the example, \"John spread butter on a bagel.\" In this sentence, the lexical concepts \"spread,\" \"butter,\" and \"bagel\" are associated with one another and easy to combine into a mental representation of a breakfast scenario. Conversely, consider the example, \"John baked a computer.\" Because \"baked\" and \"computer\" are not related lexical concepts, it takes more effort and time to build a mental representation of this unusual scenario.\n\nHowever, spreading activation models of conceptual combination have been criticized in light of how humans have been observed to combined languages. Those who claim that the theory provides an insufficient account of linguistic conceptual combination refer to the ability of humans to readily understand lexical concept combinations with seemingly no apparent connection with one another. One example of this would be the sentence \"John saw an elephant cloud.\" \"Elephant\" and \"cloud\" do not shared a close association, but it takes little effort to comprehend that the term \"elephant cloud\" refers to a cloud shaped like an elephant. This has led some to conclude that the combination of lexical concepts does not wholly rely on the simultaneous activation of linked lexical concepts alone. Rather, they claim that the process involves the use of existing nodes to generate entirely new concepts independent of their parent concepts.\n\nAlthough many theories of novel noun-noun combination interpretation ignore the effect of social environment, some theorists have attempted to account for any contingencies social context may cause.\n\nWhen lexical concept combinations are interpreted without the influence of social context, the interpretation carried out is termed \"sense generation.\" This includes all processes that would normally occur excepting those dependent on a conversation partner. The \"generation hypothesis\" accordingly states that the interpretation mechanism of a noun-noun combination is essentially the same regardless of context. This does not rule out the possibility that social context can affect sense generation in some way, but it does assert that the basic structure of the process is unaffected. As seen above, debate as to what sense generation entails and how many sub-processes into which it should be divided is a contentious matter in cognitive science.\n\nThe \"anaphor resolution hypothesis\" instead asserts that before sense generation occurs, interpreters first search their memory of recent communication to see if the combination refers to something previously discussed. This process is termed \"anaphor resolution'.' If a referent is identified, interpretation occurs without sense generation in light of that referent. Even if an explicit referent does not exist, anaphor resolution can help facilitate sense generation by providing more information that might hint at the combination's intended meaning.\n\nThe \"dual-process hypothesis\" not to be confused with dual-process theory, states that sense generation and anaphor resolution occur in parallel. Both processes begin to work once the noun-noun combination is presented. Proponents of this hypothesis disagree as to how the interpretation is eventually resolves. Some believe that whichever process reaches a conclusion first provides the answer. Others believe that both provide continuous input to a third, mediating process that eventually makes a decision based on input from both.\n\nCreativity necessitates the employment of existing concepts in novel ways, and therefore requires conceptual combination. Surprisingly, this contribution seems to be limited. Conceptual combination is a significant contributor to convergent thinking, but not divergent thinking. For example, practice with generating new concepts through combination does not improve brainstorming. It does, however, assist in devising creative problem solving methods.\n\nThe psychological community's growing understanding of how concepts are manipulated has allowed educators to teach new concepts more effectively. Tools that are developed based on conceptual combination theory attempt to teach individual tasks, and then challenge students to exercise them together in order to promote both base subject skills and the critical thinking needed to apply them simultaneously to solve new problems. Máder & Vajda, for instance, developed a three-dimensional grid with cells of adjustable height which has been successfully used in numerous activities capable of improving the effectiveness of high school mathematics education.\n"}

Patterson described the situation as \"a national challenge of unprecedented proportions\".\n\nWhen Jamaica gained independence in 1962, the murder rate was 3.9 per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the lowest in the world. In 2005, Jamaica had 1,674 murders for a murder rate of 58 per 100,000 people. That year, Jamaica had the highest murder rate in the world.\nIn November 2008, the Jamaican Parliament voted to retain the death penalty, which is performed by hanging.\n\nThere were 1,682 reported murders in 2009 and 1,428 in 2010. Since 2011 the murder rate has continued to fall following the downward trend started in 2010, with increases in police patrols, curfews, and more effective anti-gang activities. In 2012, the Ministry of National Security reported a 30 percent decrease in murders. Many of the murders in Jamaica are connected to organized crime in the country's urban centers, and most of this organized crime involves the illegal drug trade.\n\nThere has been a vast reduction in violence against LGBT individuals in Jamaica. The U.S. Department of State reported that brutality with homosexuals, mainly by private citizens, was widespread in 2008. Homosexuality \"per se\" is not illegal in Jamaica; however the Offenses Against the Person Act criminalizes buggery (anal sex) as well as \"acts of gross indecency\" between men. Many Jamaicans are hostile toward LGBT and intersex people, and several mob attacks against gay people have been reported. International human rights groups, the local LGBT rights organization, Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (JFLAG) and many Jamaicans have called on the government to take measures to protect LGBT people, including repealing the buggery law.\n\n"}

{"id": "359978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=359978", "title": "Garifuna", "text": "Garifuna\n\nThe Garifuna ( ; pl. Garinagu in Garifuna) are an Amerindian ethnic group native to Central America who speak an eponymous Arawakan language. While they are ancestrally and genealogically descended from groups that migrated from the Lesser Antilles, mainly Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, many Garifuna today are of mixed ancestry, primarily with West African, Central African, Island Carib, European, and Arawak admixture.\n\nMost Garifuna people live along the Caribbean Coast of Honduras, with smaller populations in Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua. They arrived there after being exiled from the islands of the Lesser Antilles by British colonial administration as \"Black Caribs\" after a series of slave revolts. Those Caribs deemed to have had less African admixture were not exiled and are still present in the Caribbean. There is now also a large number that have moved to the United States.\n\nThe Carib people migrated from the mainland to the islands circa 1200, according to carbon dating of artifacts. They largely displaced, exterminated and assimilated the Taíno who were resident on the islands at the time.\n\nThe French missionary Raymond Breton arrived in the Lesser Antilles in 1635, and lived on Guadeloupe and Dominica until 1653. He took ethnographic and linguistic notes on the native peoples of these islands, including St. Vincent, which he visited briefly. According to oral history noted by the English governor William Young in 1795, Carib-speaking people of the Orinoco River area on the mainland came to St. Vincent long before the arrival of Europeans to the New World. They subdued the local inhabitants called Galibeis, and unions took place between the peoples.\n\nAccording to Young's record, the first Africans arrived in 1675 following the wreck of a slave ship from the Bight of Biafra. The survivors, members of the Mokko people of today's Nigeria (now known as Ibibio) and the British sailors, reached the small island of Bequia. The Carib took them to St. Vincent and intermarried with them, supplying the men with wives, as it was taboo in their society for men to go unwed.\n\nIn 1635 the Carib were overwhelmed by French forces led by the adventurer Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and his nephew Jacques Dyel du Parquet. They imposed French colonial rule on the indigenous Carib peoples. Cardinal Richelieu of France gave the island to the Saint Christophe Company, in which he was a shareholder. Later the company was reorganized as the Company of the American Islands. The French colonists imposed French Law on the inhabitants, and Jesuit missionaries arrived to convert them to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nBecause the Carib people resisted working as laborers to build and maintain the sugar and cocoa plantations which the French began to develop in the Caribbean, in 1636 King Louis XIII proclaimed \"La Traité des Noirs\". This authorized the capture and purchase of slaves from sub-Saharan Africa and their transportation as labor to Martinique and other parts of the French West Indies.\n\nIn 1650, the Company liquidated, selling Martinique to Jacques Dyel du Parquet, who became governor. He held this position until his death in 1658. His widow Mme. du Parquet took over control of the island from France. As more French colonists arrived, they were attracted to the fertile area known as \"Cabesterre\" (leeward side). The French had pushed the remaining Carib people to this northeastern coast and the Caravalle Peninsula, but the colonists wanted the additional land. The Jesuits and the Dominicans agreed that whichever order arrived there first, would get all future parishes in that part of the island. The Jesuits came by sea and the Dominicans by land, with the Dominicans' ultimately prevailing.\n\nWhen the Carib revolted against French rule in 1660, the Governor Charles Houel sieur de Petit Pré retaliated with war against them. Many were killed; those who survived were taken captive and expelled from the island. On Martinique, the French colonists signed a peace treaty with the few remaining Carib. Some Carib had fled to Dominica and St. Vincent, where the French agreed to leave them at peace.\nBritain and France both made conflicting claims on St. Vincent from the late seventeenth century onward. French pioneers began informally cultivating plots on the island around 1710. In 1719 the governor of Martinique sent a force to occupy it, but was repulsed by the Carib inhabitants. A British attempt in 1723 was also repelled. In 1748, Britain and France agreed to put aside their claims and declared St. Vincent to be a neutral island, under no European sovereign. Throughout this period, however, unofficial, mostly French settlement took place on the island, especially on the Leeward side. African refugees continued to reach St. Vincent, and a mixed-race population developed through unions with the Carib.\n\nIn 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, Britain gained rule over St. Vincent following its defeat of France in the Seven Years' War, fought in both Europe and North America. It also took over all French territory in North America east of the Mississippi River. Through the rest of the century, the Carib-African natives mounted a series of Carib Wars, which were encouraged and supported by the French. By the end of the 18th century, the indigenous population was primarily mixed race. Following the death of their leader \"Satuye\" (Joseph Chatoyer), the Carib on St. Vincent finally surrendered to the British in 1796 after the Second Carib War, having resisted for much longer than natives on other islands. \"St. Vincent was the last of the Windward Islands to be totally subjugated.\"\n\nThis was also in the period of the violent slave revolts in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which ultimately led to the slaves gaining the independent republic of Haiti in 1804. The French lost thousands of troops in an attempt to take back the island in 1803, many to yellow fever epidemics. Thousands of whites and free people of color were killed in the revolution. Europeans throughout the Caribbean and in the American South feared future slave revolts.\n\nThe British deported the Garifuna to Roatán, an island off the coast of Honduras. Based in part on their experience with slavery in other parts of the Caribbean and North America, the British separated the more African-looking Caribs from the more Amerindian-looking ones. They decided that the former had to be exiled, while the latter were \"misled\" and allowed to remain. Five thousand Garinagu were exiled but, weakened by captivity, only about half of them (2,500) survived the voyage to Roatán. Because the island was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garifuna petitioned Spanish authorities to be allowed to settle on the mainland in the Spanish colonies. The Spanish employed them, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of the Central American colonies.\n\nLarge-scale sugar production and chattel slavery were not established on St. Vincent until the British took it over. As Great Britain abolished slavery in 1832, it operated it for roughly a generation on the island, creating a legacy different than on other Caribbean islands. Elsewhere slavery had been institutionalized for much longer.\n\nIn the 21st century, the Garifuna population is estimated to be around 600,000 in total, taking together its people in Central America, Yurumein (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), and the United States. As a result of extensive emigration from Central America, the United States has the second-largest population of Garifuna outside Central America. New York has the largest population, dominated by Garifuna from Honduras, Guatemala and Belize. Los Angeles ranks second with Honduran Garifuna being the most populous, followed by those from Belize and Guatemala. There is no information regarding Garifuna from Nicaragua having migrated to either coast of the United States. The Nicaraguan Garifuna population is quite small. Community leaders are attempting to resurrect the Garifuna language and cultural traditions.\n\nBy 2014 more Garifuna were leaving Honduras and \"illegally\" immigrating to the United States.\n\nThe distinction between diaspora and transnational migration is that diaspora implies the dispersal of a people from a homeland, whether voluntarily or through exile, to multiple nation-states. Transnational migration is generally associated with two locations. In addition, in contrast to the more intense contact which contemporary transmigrants have with their country of origin, diasporic populations often have a more tenuous relationship to the \"homeland\" or society of origin. Historically there was little hope of return; the relationship is more remote, or even imagined. Thus the African diaspora was that of people being taken captive and sold into slavery, and delivered to various parts of the New World. In those early centuries, return was impossible. Slaves from West African peoples formed relationships with the Carib and a new people developed.\n\nThe Garifuna people developed through a process of ethnogenesis on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, and were exiled in the colonial period to the Caribbean coasts of Central America. Since the late 20th century, many have emigrated from what are now Honduras, Belize and Guatemala to the United States. For the Garífuna, the politics of diaspora are complex because they have several different homelands and different relationships to them: from the mainly symbolic relationship to Africa and St. Vincent, to the closer relationship to various national homelands of Central America. The specific form of identification by individuals with each homeland has different political implications. Garifuna identity in diaspora is complex, involving local, national, and transnational processes, as well as global ethnic politics.\n\nThe Garifuna language is an offshoot of the Island Carib language, and it is spoken in Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, and Nicaragua by the Garifuna people. It is an Arawakan language with French, English, and Spanish influences, reflecting their long interaction with various colonial peoples. Garifuna has a vocabulary featuring some terms used by women and others used primarily by men. This may derive from historical Carib practices: in the colonial era, the Carib of both sexes spoke Island Carib. Men additionally used a distinct pidgin based on the unrelated mainland Carib language.\n\nAlthough many people speak it, it is not treated as a real language by some as it has no official written component to it, it is only spoken. This makes the language hard to learn unless it is learned in early childhood, along with other languages simultaneously. This occurs most often as children learn the Garifuna as a cultural language and a language such as Spanish or English spoken as the official language of where they live.\n\nAlmost all Garifuna are bilingual or multilingual. They generally speak the official languages of the countries they inhabit, such as Spanish and English, most commonly as a first language. Many also speak Garifuna, mostly as a cultural language, as a part of their families heritage.\n\nThe Garinagu do not have an official religion, but a complex set of practices for individuals and groups to show respect for their ancestors and Bungiu [God] or Sunti Gabafu [All Powerful]. A shaman known as a \"buyei\" is the head of all Garifuna traditional practices. The spiritual practices of the Garinagu have qualities similar to the voodoo rituals performed by other tribes of African descent. Mystical practices and participation such as in the Dugu ceremony and chugu are also widespread among Garifuna. At times, traditional religions have prohibited members of their congregation from participating in these or other rituals.\n\nToday, the majority of Garifuna are officially Catholic but some following other religions. They practice a syncretic Catholicism, incorporating traditional beliefs.\n\nThere is also a Rastafarian minority, primarily living in Dangriga, Belize City, Belize, and in Livingston, Guatemala.\n\nIn 2001 UNESCO proclaimed the language, dance, and music of the Garifuna as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in Nicaragua, Honduras, and Belize. In 2005 the First Garifuna Summit was held in Corn Islands, Nicaragua, with the participation of the government of other Central American countries.\n\nThere is a wide variety of Garifuna dishes, including the more commonly known \"ereba\" (cassava bread) made from grated cassava root, yucca. The process of making \"ereba\" is arguably the most important tradition practiced by the Garifuna people. Cassava is so closely tied to the Garifuna culture that the very name Garifuna draws its origin from the Caribs who were originally called \"Karifuna\" of the cassava clan. They later adopted the name \"Garifuna\", which literally means cassava-eating people. Making \"ereba\" is a long and arduous process that involves a large group of Garifuna (mostly women and children) hiking into the jungle to dig up a large quantity of the cassava root (usually several dozen pounds) and taking it back to the village. The root is then washed peeled and grated over small sharp stones affixed to wooden boards. The grating is difficult and time consuming, and the women sing sad and slow songs to break the monotony of the work. The grated cassava is then placed into a large cylindrical woven bag called a \"ruguma\". The \"ruguma\" is hung from a tree and weighted at the bottom with heavy rocks in order to squeeze out and remove the poisonous liquid and starch from the grated pulp. The counterweight is sometimes provided by piercing the bottom of the \"ruguma\" with a tree branch and having one or two Garifuna women sit on the branch. Whatever the manner in which the weight is provided, the result is the same. The cassava is then ready to be made into flour. The remaining pulp is dried overnight and later sieved through flat rounded baskets (\"hibise\") to form flour that is baked into pancakes on a large iron griddle (\"Comal\"). \"Ereba\" is eaten with fish, \"machuca\" (pounded green and ripe plantains) or alone with gravy (\"lasusu\") often made with a fish soup called \"hudutu\". Other accompanying dishes may include: \"bundiga\" (a green banana lasusu), \"mazapan\", and \"bimecacule\" (sticky sweet rice), as well as a coconut rice made with red beans. Nigerians also make \"eba\", \"gari\" and \"fufu\" from dried, grated cassava flour and similar accompanying dishes such as \"ewuro\" or egusi\" (made with melon seeds) soup. An alcoholic drink called \"gifiti\" is commonly made at home; it is rum-based bitters, made by soaking roots and herbs.\n\nGarifuna music is quite different from that of the rest of Central America. The most famous form is punta. In its associated dance style, dancers move their hips in a circular motion. An evolved form of traditional music, still usually played using traditional instruments, punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called punta rock. Traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive. Artists like Pen Cayetano helped innovate modern punta rock by adding guitars to the traditional music, and paved the way for later artists like Andy Palacio, Children of the Most High, and Black Coral. Punta was popular across the region, especially in Belize, by the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of \"Punta Rockers\" in 1987, a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest stars. Punta musicians in Central America, the US, and elsewhere made further advances with the introduction of the piano, woodwind, brass and string instruments. Punta-rock has grown since the early 1980s to include other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer and electric bass guitar as well as other percussive instruments.\n\nPunta along with Reggaeton music are predominantly popular and influential among the entire population in Honduras. Often mixed with Spanish, Punta has a widespread audience due to the immigration of Hondurans and Guatemalan to the United States, other parts of Latin America and Europe, notably Spain. Punta bands in Honduras such as Kazzabe, Shabakan, Silver Star, Los Rolands, Banda Blanca, Los Gatos Bravos and Grupo Zambat have appeal for Latin American migrant communities. Honduran Punta has caused Belizean and Guatemalan Punta to use more Spanish due to the commercial success achieved by bands that use it.\n\nWhen Banda Blanca of Honduras sold over 3 million copies of \"Sopa De Caracol\" (\"Conch Soup\"), originally written by Belizean Chico Ramos, the Garifunas of Belize felt cheated but celebrated the success. The genre is continuing to develop a strong following in the United States and South America and the Caribbean.[14]\n\nBelizean punta is distinctive from traditional punta in that songs are usually in Kriol or Garifuna and rarely in Spanish or English. calypso and soca have had some effect on it. Like calypso and soca, Belizean punta provides social commentary and risqué humor, though the initial wave of punta acts eschewed the former. Calypso Rose, Lord Rhaburn and the Cross Culture Band assisted the acceptance of punta by Belizean Kriol people by singing calypso songs about punta - songs such as \"Gumagrugu Watah\" and \"Punta Rock Eena Babylon\".[14]\n\nProminent broadcasters of Punta music include WAVE Radio and Krem Radio.\n\nOther forms of Garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. However, punta is the most popular dance in Garifuna culture. It is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. Chumba and hunguhungu involve circular dancing to a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta. There are other types of songs typical of each gender: women having eremwu eu and abaimajani, rhythmic a cappella songs, and laremuna wadaguman; and men having work songs, chumba, and hunguhungu.\n\nDrums play a very important role in Garifuna music. Primarily two types of drums are used: the \"primero\" (tenor drum) and the \"segunda\" (bass drum). These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood, such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep.\n\nAlso used in combination with the drums are the \"sisera\", which are shakers made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, and then fitted with hardwood handles.\n\nParanda music developed soon after the Garifunas' arrival in Central America. The music is instrumental and percussion-based. The music was barely recorded until the 1990s, when Ivan Duran of Stonetree Records began the Paranda Project.\nIn contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio, Mohobub Flores, and Aurelio Martinez. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds. Described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda, this music is exemplified in Andy Palacio's album \"Watina,\" and in \"Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project\", both of which were released on the Belizean record label, Stonetree Records. Canadian musician Danny Michel has also recorded an album, \"Black Birds Are Dancing Over Me\", with a collective of Garifuna musicians.\n\nIn the Garifuna culture there is another dance called \"dugu\", which is included as part of a ritual done following a death in the family so as to pay respect to the departed loved one.\n\nThrough traditional dance and music, musicians have come together to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS.\n\nGender roles within the Garifuna communities are significantly defined by the job opportunities available to everyone. The Garifuna people have relied on farming for a steady income in the past, but much of this land was taken by fruit companies in the 20th century. These companies were welcomed at first because the production helped bring an income to the local communities, but as business declined these large companies sold the land and it has become inhabited by mestizo farmers. Since this time the Garifuna people have been forced to travel and find jobs with foreign companies. The Garifuna people mainly rely on export businesses for steady jobs; however, women are highly discriminated against and are usually unable to get these jobs. Men generally work for foreign-owned companies collecting timber and chicle to be exported, or work as fishermen.\n\nGarifuna people live in a matrilocal society, but the women are forced to rely on men for a steady income in order to support their families, because the few jobs that are available, housework and selling homemade goods, do not create enough of an income to survive on. Although women have power within their homes, they rely heavily on the income of their husbands.\n\nAlthough men can be away at work for large amounts of time they still believe that there is a strong connection between men and their newborn sons. Garifunas believe that a baby boy and his father have a special bond, and they are attached spiritually. It is important for a son's father to take care of him, which means that he must give up some of his duties in order to spend time with his child. During this time women gain more responsibility and authority within the household.\n\nAccording to one genetic study the ancestry of the Garifuna people on average, is 76% African, 20% Arawak/Carib and 4% European, but the admixture levels vary greatly between island and Central American Garinagu Communities with Stann Creek, Belize Garinagu having 79.9% African, 2.7% European and 17.4% Amerindian and Sandy Bay, St. Vincent Garinagu having 41.1% African, 16.7% European and 42.2% Amerindian.\n\nThe Garifuna culture is greatly affected by the economic atmosphere surrounding the community. This makes the communities extremely susceptible to outside influence. Many worry that the area will become extremely commercialized since there are few economic opportunities within the area.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "295445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295445", "title": "Global cooling", "text": "Global cooling\n\nGlobal cooling was a conjecture during the 1970s of imminent cooling of the Earth's surface and atmosphere culminating in a period of extensive glaciation. \nPress reports at the time did not accurately reflect the full scope of the debate in the scientific literature. The current scientific opinion on climate change is that the Earth underwent global warming throughout the 20th century and continues to warm.\n\nBy the 1970s, scientists were becoming increasingly aware that estimates of global temperatures showed cooling since 1945, as well as the possibility of large scale warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases. In the scientific papers which considered climate trends of the 21st century, less than 10% inclined towards future cooling, while most papers predicted future warming. The general public had little awareness of carbon dioxide's effects on climate, but \"Science News\" in May 1959 forecast a 25% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 150 years from 1850 to 2000, with a consequent warming trend. The actual increase in this period was 29%. Paul R. Ehrlich mentioned climate change from greenhouse gases in 1968. By the time the idea of global cooling reached the public press in the mid-1970s temperatures had stopped falling, and there was concern in the climatological community about carbon dioxide's warming effects. In response to such reports, the World Meteorological Organization issued a warning in June 1976 that \"a very significant warming of global climate\" was probable.\n\nCurrently, there are some concerns about the possible regional cooling effects of a slowdown or shutdown of thermohaline circulation, which might be provoked by an increase of fresh water mixing into the North Atlantic due to glacial melting. The probability of this occurring is generally considered to be very low, and the IPCC notes, \"even in models where the THC weakens, there is still a warming over Europe. For example, in all AOGCM integrations where the radiative forcing is increasing, the sign of the temperature change over north-west Europe is positive.\"\n\nThe cooling period is reproduced by current (1999 on) global climate models (GCMs) that include the physical effects of sulfate aerosols, and there is now general agreement that aerosol effects were the dominant cause of the mid-20th century cooling. At the time there were two physical mechanisms that were most frequently advanced to cause cooling: aerosols and orbital forcing.\n\nHuman activity — mostly as a by-product of fossil fuel combustion, partly by land use changes — increases the number of tiny particles (aerosols) in the atmosphere. These have a direct effect: they effectively increase the planetary albedo, thus cooling the planet by reducing the solar radiation reaching the surface; and an indirect effect: they affect the properties of clouds by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. In the early 1970s some speculated that this cooling effect might dominate over the warming effect of the CO release: see discussion of Rasool and Schneider (1971), below. As a result of observations and a switch to cleaner fuel burning, this no longer seems likely; current scientific work indicates that global warming is far more likely. Although the temperature drops foreseen by this mechanism have now been discarded in light of better theory and the observed warming, aerosols are thought to have contributed a cooling tendency (outweighed by increases in greenhouse gases) and also have contributed to \"Global Dimming.\"\n\nOrbital forcing refers to the slow, cyclical changes in the tilt of Earth's axis and shape of its orbit. These cycles alter the total amount of sunlight reaching the Earth by a small amount and affect the timing and intensity of the seasons. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the timing of the ice age cycles, and understanding of the mechanism was increasing rapidly in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe paper of Hays, Imbrie and Shackleton \"Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages\" qualified its predictions with the remark that \"forecasts must be qualified in two ways. First, they apply only to the natural component of future climatic trends - and not to anthropogenic effects such as those due to the burning of fossil fuels. Second, they describe only the long-term trends, because they are linked to orbital variations with periods of 20,000 years and longer. Climatic oscillations at higher frequencies are not predicted... the results indicate that the long-term trend over the next 20,000 years is towards extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation and cooler climate\".\n\nThe idea that ice ages cycles were predictable appears to have become conflated with the idea that another one was due \"soon\" - perhaps because much of this study was done by geologists, who are accustomed to dealing with very long time scales and use \"soon\" to refer to periods of thousands of years. A strict application of the Milankovitch theory does not allow the prediction of a \"rapid\" ice age onset (i.e., less than a century or two) since the fastest orbital period is about 20,000 years. Some creative ways around this were found, notably one championed by Nigel Calder under the name of \"snowblitz\", but these ideas did not gain wide acceptance.\n\nIt is common to see it asserted that the length of the current interglacial temperature peak is similar to the length of the preceding interglacial peak (Sangamon/Eem), and from this conclude that we might be nearing the end of this warm period. This conclusion is mistaken. Firstly, because the lengths of previous interglacials were not particularly regular; see figure. Petit et al. note that \"interglacials 5.5 and 9.3 are different from the Holocene, but similar to each other in duration, shape and amplitude. During each of these two events, there is a warm period of 4 kyr followed by a relatively rapid cooling\". Secondly, future orbital variations will not closely resemble those of the past.\n\nIn 1923, there was concern about a new ice age and Captain Donald Baxter MacMillan sailed toward the Arctic sponsored by the National Geographical Society to look for evidence of advancing glaciers.\n\nIn 1926, a Berlin astronomer was predicting global cooling but that it was \"ages away\".\n\nConcerns that a new ice age was approaching was revived in the 1950s. During the Cold War, there were concerns by Harry Wexler that setting off atom bombs could be hastening a new ice age from a nuclear winter scenario.\n\nJ. Murray Mitchell showed as early as 1963 a multidecadal cooling since about 1940. At a conference on climate change held in Boulder, Colorado in 1965, evidence supporting Milankovitch cycles triggered speculation on how the calculated small changes in sunlight might somehow trigger ice ages. In 1966, Cesare Emiliani predicted that \"a new glaciation will begin within a few thousand years.\" In his 1968 book \"The Population Bomb\", Paul R. Ehrlich wrote \"The greenhouse effect is being enhanced now by the greatly increased level of carbon dioxide... [this] is being countered by low-level clouds generated by contrails, dust, and other contaminants... At the moment we cannot predict what the overall climatic results will be of our using the atmosphere as a garbage dump.\"\n\nConcern peaked in the early 1970s, though \"the possibility of anthropogenic warming dominated\nthe peer-reviewed literature even then\" (a cooling period began in 1945, and two decades of a cooling trend suggested a trough had been reached after several decades of warming). This peaking concern is partially attributable to the fact much less was then known about world climate and causes of ice ages. Climate scientists were aware that predictions based on this trend were not possible - because the trend was poorly studied and not understood (for example see reference). Despite that, in the popular press the possibility of cooling was reported generally without the caveats present in the scientific reports, and \"unusually severe winters in Asia and parts of North America in 1972 and 1973...pushed the issue into the public consciousness\".\n\nIn the 1970s, the compilation of records to produce hemispheric, or global, temperature records had just begun.\n\nSpencer R. Weart's history of \"The Discovery of Global Warming\" states that: \"While neither scientists nor the public could be sure in the 1970s whether the world was warming or cooling, people were increasingly inclined to believe that global climate was on the move, and in no small way.\"\n\nOn January 11, 1970, the Washington Post reported that \"Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age\".\n\nIn 1972, Emiliani warned \"Man's activity may either precipitate this new ice age or lead to substantial or even total melting of the ice caps...\". By 1972 a group of glacial-epoch experts at a conference agreed that \"the natural end of our warm epoch is undoubtedly near\"; but the volume of Quaternary Research reporting on the meeting said that \"the basic conclusion to be drawn from the discussions in this section is that the knowledge necessary for understanding the mechanism of climate change is still lamentably inadequate\". Unless there were impacts from future human activity, they thought that serious cooling \"must be expected within the next few millennia or even centuries\"; but many other scientists doubted these conclusions.\n\nIn 1972, George Kukla and Robert Matthews, in a Science write-up of a conference, asked when and how the current interglacial would end; concluding that \"Global cooling and related rapid changes of environment, substantially exceeding the fluctuations experienced by man in historical times, must be expected within the next few millennia or even centuries.\"\n\nThe 1970 Study of Critical Environmental Problems reported the possibility of warming from increased carbon dioxide, but no concerns about cooling, setting a lower bound on the beginning of interest in \"global cooling\".\n\nBy 1971, studies indicated that human caused air pollution was spreading, but there was uncertainty as to whether aerosols would cause warming or cooling, and whether or not they were more significant than rising levels. J. Murray Mitchell still viewed humans as \"innocent bystanders\" in the cooling from the 1940s to 1970, but in 1971 his calculations suggested that rising emissions could cause significant cooling after 2000, though he also argued that emissions could cause warming depending on circumstances. Calculations were too basic at this time to be trusted to give reliable results.\n\nAn early numerical computation of climate effects was published in the journal \"Science\" in July 1971 as a paper by S. Ichtiaque Rasool and Stephen H. Schneider, titled \"Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Aerosols: Effects of Large Increases on Global Climate\".\nThe paper used rudimentary data and equations to compute the possible future effects of large increases in the densities in the atmosphere of two types of human environmental emissions:\nThe paper suggested that the global warming due to greenhouse gases would tend to have less effect with greater densities, and while aerosol pollution could cause warming, it was likely that it would tend to have a cooling effect which increased with density. They concluded that \"An increase by only a factor of 4 in global aerosol background concentration may be sufficient to reduce the surface temperature by as much as 3.5 ° K. If sustained over a period of several years, such a temperature decrease over the whole globe is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age.\"\n\nBoth their equations and their data were badly flawed, as was soon pointed out by other scientists and confirmed by Schneider himself. In January 1972, Robert Jay Charlson et al. pointed out that with other reasonable assumptions, the model produced the opposite conclusion. The model made no allowance for changes in clouds or convection, and erroneously indicated that 8 times as much would only cause 2 °C of warming. In a paper published in 1975, Schneider corrected the overestimate of aerosol cooling by checking data on the effects of dust produced by volcanoes. When the model included estimated changes in solar intensity, it gave a reasonable match to temperatures over the previous thousand years and its prediction was that \" warming dominates the surface temperature patterns soon after 1980.\"\n\nThe National Science Board's \"Patterns and Perspectives in Environmental Science\" report of 1972 discussed the cyclical behavior of climate, and the understanding at the time that the planet was entering a phase of cooling after a warm period. \"Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end, to be followed by a long period of considerably colder temperatures leading into the next glacial age some 20,000 years from now.\" But it also continued; \"However, it is possible, or even likely, that human interference has already altered the environment so much that the climatic pattern of the near future will follow a different path.\"\n\nThe Board's report of 1974, \"Science And The Challenges Ahead\", continued on this theme. \"During the last 20-30 years, world temperature has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply over the last decade.\" Discussion of cyclic glacial periods does not feature in this report. Instead it is the role of humans that is central to the report's analysis.\n\"The cause of the cooling trend is not known with certainty. But there is increasing concern that man himself may be implicated, not only in the recent cooling trend but also in the warming temperatures over the last century\". The report did not conclude whether carbon dioxide in warming, or agricultural and industrial pollution in cooling, are factors in the recent climatic changes, noting;\n\"Before such questions as these can be resolved, major advances must be made in understanding the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere and oceans, and in measuring and tracing particulates through the system.\"\n\nThere also was a Report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) entitled, \"Understanding Climate Change: A Program for Action\".\n\nThe report stated (p. 36) that, \"The average surface air temperature in the northern hemisphere increased from the 1880's until about 1940 and has been decreasing thereafter.\"\n\nIt also stated (p. 44) that, \"If both the and particulate inputs to the atmosphere grow at equal rates in the future, the widely differing atmospheric residence times of the two pollutants means that the particulate effect will grow in importance relative to that of .\"\n\nThe report did not predict whether the 25-year cooling trend would continue. It stated (Forward, p. v) that, \"we do not have a good quantitative understanding of our climate machine and what determines its course [so] it does not seem possible to predict climate,\" and (p. 2) \"The climates of the earth have always been changing, and they will doubtless continue to do so in the future. How large these future changes will be, and where and how rapidly they will occur, we do not know.\"\n\nThe Report's \"program for action\" was a call for creation of a new \"National Climatic Research Program.\" It stated (p. 62), \"If we are to react rationally to the inevitable climatic changes of the future, and if we are ever to predict their future course, whether they are natural or man-induced, a far greater understanding of these changes is required than we now possess. It is, moreover, important that this knowledge be acquired as soon as possible.\" For that reason, it stated, \"the time has now come to initiate a broad and coordinated attack on the problem of climate and climatic change.\"\n\nWhile these discussions were ongoing in scientific circles, other accounts appeared in the popular media. In their June 24, 1974 issue, \"Time\" presented an article titled \"Another Ice Age?\" that noted \"the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades\" but noted that \"Some scientists... think that the cooling trend may be only temporary.\" \n\nAn April 28, 1975 article in \"Newsweek\" magazine was titled \"The Cooling World\", it pointed to \"ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change\" and pointed to \"a drop of half a degree [Fahrenheit] in average ground temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere between 1945 and 1968.\" The article stated \"The evidence in support of these predictions [of global cooling] has now begun to accumulate so massively that meteorologists are hard-pressed to keep up with it.\" The \"Newsweek\" article did not state the cause of cooling; it stated that \"what causes the onset of major and minor ice ages remains a mystery\" and cited the NAS conclusion that \"not only are the basic scientific questions largely unanswered, but in many cases we do not yet know enough to pose the key questions.\"\n\nThe article mentioned the alternative solutions of \"melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting Arctic rivers\" but conceded these were not feasible. The \"Newsweek\" article concluded by criticizing government leaders: \"But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies...The longer the planners (politicians) delay, the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality.\" The article emphasized sensational and largely unsourced consequences - \"resulting famines could be catastrophic\", \"drought and desolation,\" \"the most devastating outbreak of tornadoes ever recorded\", \"droughts, floods, extended dry spells, long freezes, delayed monsoons,\" \"impossible for starving peoples to migrate,\" \"the present decline has taken the planet about a sixth of the way toward the Ice Age.\"\n\nOn October 23, 2006, \"Newsweek\" issued a correction, over 31 years after the original article, stating that it had been \"so spectacularly wrong about the near-term future\" (though editor Jerry Adler stated that \"the story wasn't 'wrong' in the journalistic sense of 'inaccurate.'\")\n\nAcademic analysis of the peer-reviewed studies published at that time shows that most papers examining aspects of climate during the 1970s were either neutral or showed a warming trend.\n\nIn 1977, a popular book on the topic was published, called \"The Weather Conspiracy: The Coming of the New Ice Age\".\nThere were also a US TV show narrated by Leonard Nimoy in the 1977 \"In Search of... (TV series)\", episode 27, season 2, titled, \"The Coming Ice Age: An inquiry into whether the dramatic weather changes in America's northern states mean that a new ice age is approaching.\" \n\nLater in the decade, at a WMO conference in 1979, F K Hare reported:\n\nConcerns about nuclear winter arose in the early 1980s from several reports. Similar speculations have appeared over effects due to catastrophes such as asteroid impacts and massive volcanic eruptions. In 1991, a prediction that massive oil well fires in Kuwait would cause significant effects on climate was incorrect.\n\nIn January 1999, contrarian Patrick Michaels wrote a commentary offering to \"take even money that the 10 years ending on December 31, 2007, will show a statistically significant global cooling trend in temperatures measured by satellite\", on the basis of his view that record temperatures in 1998 had been a blip. Indeed, over that period, satellite-measured temperatures never again approached their 1998 peak. Due to a sharp but temporary dip in temperatures in 1999-2000, a least-squares linear regression fit to the satellite temperature record showed little overall trend. The RSS satellite temperature record showed a slight cooling trend, but the UAH satellite temperature record showed a slight warming trend.\n\nIn 2003, the Office of Net Assessment at the United States Department of Defense was commissioned to produce a study on the likely and potential effects of abrupt modern climate change should a shutdown of thermohaline circulation occur. The study, conducted under ONA head Andrew Marshall, modelled its prospective climate change on the 8.2 kiloyear event, precisely because it was the middle alternative between the Younger Dryas and the Little Ice Age. Scientists acknowledge that \"abrupt climate change initiated by Greenland ice sheet melting is not a realistic scenario for the 21st century\".\n\nCurrently, the concern that cooler temperatures would continue, and perhaps at a faster rate, has been observed to be incorrect by the IPCC. More has to be learned about climate, but the growing records have shown that the cooling concerns of 1975 have not been borne out.\n\nAs for the prospects of the end of the current interglacial, while the four most recent interglacials lasted about 10,000 years, the interglacial before that lasted around 28,000 years. Milankovitch-type calculations indicate that the present interglacial would probably continue for tens of thousands of years naturally in the absence of human perturbations. Other estimates (Loutre and Berger, based on orbital calculations) put the unperturbed length of the present interglacial at 50,000 years. Berger (EGU 2005 presentation) thinks that the present CO perturbation will last long enough to suppress the next glacial cycle entirely.This is entirely consistent with David Archer's and colleague's prediction who argue that the present level of will suspend the next glacial period for the next 500,000 years and will be the longest duration and intensity of the projected interglacial period and are longer than have been seen in the last 2.6 million years.\n\nAs the NAS report indicates, scientific knowledge regarding climate change was more uncertain than it is today. At the time that Rasool and Schneider wrote their 1971 paper, climatologists had not yet recognized the significance of greenhouse gases other than water vapor and carbon dioxide, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. Early in that decade, carbon dioxide was the only widely studied human-influenced greenhouse gas. The attention drawn to atmospheric gases in the 1970s stimulated many discoveries in subsequent decades. As the temperature pattern changed, global cooling was of waning interest by 1979.\n\nA common argument used to dispute the significance of human caused climate change, which TIME Magazine calls the Ice Age Fallacy, is to allege that scientists showed concerns about global cooling which did not materialise, therefore there is no need to heed current scientific concerns about climate change. In a 1998 article promoting the Oregon Petition, Fred Singer argued that expert concerns about global warming should be dismissed on the basis that what he called \"the same hysterical fears\" had supposedly been expressed earlier about global cooling.\nIllustrating this argument, for several years an image has been circulated of a \"Time\" magazine cover, supposedly dated 1977, showing a penguin above a cover story title \"How to Survive the Coming Ice Age\". In March 2013, \"The Mail on Sunday\" published an article by David Rose, showing this same cover image, to support his claim that there was as much concern in the 1970s about a \"looming 'ice age'\" as there was now about global warming. After researching the authenticity of the magazine cover image, in July 2013, Bryan Walsh, a senior editor at \"Time\", confirmed that the image was a hoax, modified from a 2007 cover story image for \"The Global Warming Survival Guide\".\n\n\n\n"}

Some women and girls from Colombia, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Suriname who had been in prostitution in Trinidadian brothels and clubs have been identified as trafficking victims. Trinidadian trafficking victims have been identified in the United Kingdom and the United States. Undocumented economic migrants from the region and from Asia may be vulnerable to forced labor and forced prostitution. As a hub for regional travel, Trinidad and Tobago also is a potential transit point for trafficking victims traveling to Caribbean and South American destinations.\n\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. Despite these efforts, Trinidad and Tobago is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because the government did not show progress in prosecuting and punishing trafficking crimes and protecting trafficking victims, whom the government often jailed and deported. The government’s formation of a working group to substantively address its human trafficking problem portends good prospects for future improvements, and if effective legislation were adopted and enforced, the government would be poised to take the further steps in prosecuting trafficking cases and identifying and assisting victims.\n\nU.S. State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons placed the country in \"Tier 2\" in 2017.\n\nThe anti-trafficking task force, which is co-chaired by an official from the Ministry of National Security in partnership with IOM, has been overseeing the implementation of a nine-month anti-trafficking action plan and organized three subcommittees: one to draft legislation, one to develop victim assistance policies, and a third to raise public awareness; however, the government made no discernible progress in its prosecution and punishment of sex and labor trafficking offenders during the reporting period. The lack of comprehensive legislation that would make human trafficking a crime and would ensure protection of trafficking victims was a significant limitation in the government’s ability to prosecute trafficking offenders and address human trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago during the reporting period. The government reported no prosecutions, convictions, or sentences of trafficking offenders. The government reported one trafficking investigation during the year, and it began extradition proceedings in February 2010 against a foreign national wanted for human trafficking in another country. The government provided logistical, human resources, and some financial support to IOM anti-trafficking training for police, immigration officers, police, and other officials during the reporting period.\n\nThe government made minimal progress in protecting victims during the reporting period. The government did not employ systematic procedures for law enforcement authorities to proactively identify victims and refer them to available services; however, in a positive step, some law enforcement officers are reported to have taken suspected victims to shelters. The task force recently began development of guidelines for officials to refer potential victims to shelter, counseling, medical care, and interpreter assistance. The government did not provide foreign trafficking victims with legal alternatives to their removal to countries where they may face hardship or retribution. The government did not report proactively identifying any victims during the reporting period. NGOs identified foreign trafficking victims in jail for immigration or other violations committed as a direct result of being trafficked that were later deported. The government offered some social services directly and through NGOS that received government funding, but due to a lack of a formal procedures to guide officials in victim identification and referral to services, few victims received assistance. Trinidadian authorities encouraged crime victims in general to assist with the investigation and prosecution of offenders, though without legislation criminalizing human trafficking or formal trafficking victim protection provisions there were few incentives for victims to assist.\n\nThe government made some progress in preventing human trafficking during the reporting period through the establishment of the anti-trafficking task force. While the government did not conduct public awareness activities during the reporting period, the responsible subcommittee developed plans to implement a trafficking victim hotline and nationwide information campaign. While prostitution is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, the government did not take additional measures to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts during the reporting period. Authorities did not consider child sex tourism to be a problem in Trinidad and Tobago during the reporting period and reported no prosecutions related to child sex tourism.\n\n"}

Some of these lakes are natural and various are manmade bodies. As per various sources only a few decades back, Hyderabad had a large number of water bodies such as lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, aquaculture ponds, tanks etc. (as per some sources between 3000 and 7000 including natural and manmade bodies. Locally known as \"cheruvu, kunta, tanks\" ). Most of these lakes have totally disappeared and the surface area of most of the surviving lakes have shrunken and turned to tiny ponds and cesspool. Some of the lakes which have totally disappeared are Tigal Kunta, Somajiguda Tank, Mir Jumla tank, Pahar Tigal Kunta, Kunta Bhawani Das, Nawab Saheb Kunta, Afzalsagar, Nallakunta, Masab Tank etc. Hussainsagar Lake, Kunta Mallaiyapalli have shrunk drastically. Out of thousands of water bodies those were existing in 1970s in various sizes in and around Hyderabad, today only about 70 to 500 of them have survived. Most of them have disappeared due to encroachment or have been illegally drained for real estate projects by private or government agencies. The existing lakes have been used to dump garbage and sewage water. Most of these lakes and tanks were built during the regime of Qutub Shah in 16th and 17th century and later by Nizams as a source of drinking water for the residents of Hyderabad. The area of Hussain Sagar, which is the largest lake in Hyderabad shrunk by more than 40% i.e. from 550 ha to 349 ha in just 30 years. This lake was built in 1575 AD and since 1930 is not being used as a source for drinking water. \n\nAs of 2010, 500 lakes were under HUDA jurisdiction. As of May 2018, HUDA maintains record of 169 lakes which occupy an area of more than 10 hectares. Out of this 62 lakes were under the control of government, 25 are owned by private organisations and 82 lakes are under joint government private ownership.As per existing government norms, no construction of any kind, irrespective of the ownership status is allowed on the lake bed. This rules are frequently violated both by government and private agencies. \n\nSome surviving lakes are listed below.

McHarg (20 November 1920 – 5 March 2001) was a Scottish landscape architect and writer on regional planning using natural systems. He was the founder of the department of landscape architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. His 1969 book \"Design with Nature\" pioneered the concept of ecological planning. It continues to be one of the most widely celebrated books on landscape architecture and land-use planning. In this book, he set forth the basic concepts that were to develop later in geographic information systems.\n\nHis father was a manager and later a salesman in the industrial city of Glasgow, Scotland. McHarg showed an early talent for drawing and was advised to consider a career in landscape architecture. His early experiences with the bifurcated landscapes of Scotland—the smoky industrial urbanism of Glasgow and the sublimity of the surrounding environs—had a profound influence on his later thinking.\n\nIt was not until after his term in the Parachute Regiment, serving in war-stricken Italy during World War II, however, that he was able to explore the field of urban landscape architecture. After working with the Royal Engineers during World War II, he travelled to America. He was admitted to the school of architecture at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design where he received professional degrees in both landscape architecture and city planning in 1949. After completing his education he returned to his homeland, intending to help rebuild a country ravaged by war. In Scotland he worked on housing and programs in \"new towns\", until he was contacted by Dean G. Holmes Perkins from the University of Pennsylvania. Dean Perkins wanted McHarg to build a new graduate program in landscape architecture at the University.\n\nSoon thereafter, McHarg began teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, where he developed the department of landscape architecture, and developed a popular new course, titled \"Man and Environment\" in 1957. The course featured leading scholars whom McHarg invited to his class to discuss ethics and values, as well as other ideas ranging from entropy to plate tectonics. In 1960, he hosted his own television show on CBS, \"The House We Live In\", inviting prominent theologians and scientists of the day to discuss the human place in the world, in a style similar to the one he honed teaching \"Man and Environment.\"\n\nIn 1963 Ian McHarg and David A. Wallace, his academic colleague from the University of Pennsylvania, founded the firm of Wallace and McHarg Associates, later Wallace McHarg Roberts & Todd (WMRT) which is known for its central role in the development of the American environmental planning and urbanism movements. The seminal work of the firm includes the plan for Baltimore's \"Inner Harbor\", the \"Plan for the Valleys\" in Baltimore County, MD, and the \"Plan for Lower Manhattan\" in New York City from 1963 through 1965.\n\nAs the first-wave American environmental movement swept across American college campuses in the 1960s and early 1970s, McHarg became an important figure, linking a compelling personal presence and a powerful rhetoric with a direct and persuasive proposal for a new integration of human and natural environments. Through the 1960s and 1970s, his course was the most popular on the Penn campus, and he was often invited to speak on campuses throughout the country.\n\nIn 1969, he published \"Design with Nature\", which was essentially a book of step-by-step instructions on how to break down a region into its appropriate uses. McHarg also was interested in garden design and believed that homes should be planned and designed with good private garden space. He promoted an ecological view, in which the designer becomes very familiar with the area through analysis of soil, climate, hydrology, etc. \"Design With Nature\" was the first work of its kind \"to define the problems of modern development and present a methodology or process prescribing compatible solutions\". The book also affected a variety of fields and ideas. Frederick R. Steiner tells us that \"environmental impact assessment, new community development, coastal zone management, brownfields restoration, zoo design, river corridor planning, and ideas about sustainability and regenerative design all display the influence of \"Design with Nature\"\".\n\n\"Design with Nature\" had its roots in much earlier landscape architecture philosophies. It was sharply critical of the French Baroque style of garden design, which McHarg saw as a subjugation of nature, and full of praise for the English picturesque style of garden design. McHarg's focus, however, was only partially on the visual and sensual qualities which had dominated the English picturesque movement. Instead, he saw the earlier tradition as a precursor of his philosophy, which was rooted less in aristocratic estate design or even garden design and more broadly in an ecological sensibility that accepted the interwoven worlds of the human and the natural, and sought to more fully and intelligently design human environments in concert with the conditions of setting, climate and environment. Always a polemicist, McHarg set his thinking in radical opposition to what he argued was the arrogant and destructive heritage of urban-industrial modernity, a style he described as \"Dominate and Destroy.\"\n\nFollowing the publication of \"Design with Nature\", Wallace McHarg Roberts & Todd (WMRT) worked in major American cities – Minneapolis, Denver, Miami, New Orleans, and Washington (DC) – and created environmentally-based master plans for Amelia Island Plantation and Sanibel Islands in Florida.\n\nIn 1971 McHarg delivered a speech at the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference in Portland, Oregon, called \"Man: Planetary Disease\". In the speech he asserted that, due to the views of man and nature that have infiltrated all of western culture, we are not guaranteed survival. Of man, McHarg said, \"He treats the world as a storehouse existing for his delectation; he plunders, rapes, poisons, and kills this living system, the biosphere, in ignorance of its workings and its fundamental value.\" To this end man is a \"planetary disease\", who has lived with no regard for nature. He discusses how in the Judeo-Christian traditions, the Bible says that man is to have dominion over the earth. McHarg says that for man to survive, this idea must be taken as an allegory only, and not as literally true. Lest this statement be construed as anti-religion, he cites Paul Tillich (Protestantism), Gustav Weigel (Catholicism), and Abram Heschel (Judaism) as noted religious scholars who are also in agreement with him on this point.\n\nIan McHarg was the original co-designer of The Woodlands, Texas, an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Texas. This community was developed from timberland located thirty miles north of Houston, by George P. Mitchell, who hired McHarg to consult on the project and, as a result, the original plans featured many of his unique designs. Due in part to concerns of flooding, McHarg identified the water system as the most critical aspect of the site. The natural drainage system the firm designed was successful at limiting the runoff with which McHarg was concerned, and was also much cheaper than a conventional drainage system would have been. In 1998, in his collection \"To Heal the Earth\", McHarg wrote that the Woodlands is one of the best examples of his ideals. Most of the actual work was done by a large team while McHarg was still there, and by many others in the years since he left. The Woodlands continues to be a successful ecological community even today.\n\nMcHarg's own plans for urban expansion projects also were more 'English' than 'French' in their geometry. He favoured what became known as 'cluster development' with relatively dense housing set in a larger natural environment.\n\nIn 1975 WMRT began the planning phase of a project for the Shah of Iran, an environmental park to be called Pardisan, unlike any the world had ever seen. The park was to demonstrate the heritage of the Iranian people, as well as to illustrate the major ecosystems of the world. McHarg was enthusiastic about this project, and greatly invested in the work. The other partners of the firm, however, believed the project to be a significant risk, despite the fact that Iran was wealthy from the sale of oil. Their concerns became justified when the Shah was overthrown and the firm was left with a large amount of debt from the project. Located in a north western area of Tehran, Pardisan still remains as a large, relatively un-designed, green space but McHargs designs were never implemented. \n\nMcHarg was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Harvard Lifetime Achievement Award, the Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Certified Planners, and 15 medals, including the 1990 National Medal of Arts, the American Society of Landscape Architects Medal, and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Architecture from the University of Virginia. In 1992, he received the Neutra Medal for Professional Excellence from the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. In 2000, he received the Japan Prize in city planning, which is presented to scientists or researchers who have made a substantial contribution to the advancement of those fields.\n\nMcHarg also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1992 \n\nIn 1980 McHarg left the firm he founded and the firm changed its name to Wallace Roberts & Todd (WRT).\n\nIn 1996, McHarg published his autobiography \"A Quest for Life\". He was also instrumental in the founding of Earth Week, and participated on task forces on environmental issues for the Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Carter administrations\nMcHarg died on 5 March 2001 at the age of eighty from pulmonary disease.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, the University of Pennsylvania School of Design launched a new, interdisciplinary research center in McHarg's honor. Anticipating the 50th publication anniversary of his seminal text \"Design with Nature\", the McHarg Center's public launch will take place in June 2019 as a part of an event, exhibition, and book project known as \"Design with Nature Now.\" It's mission is to build on PennDesign’s position as a global leader in urban ecological design by bringing environmental and social scientists together with planners, designers, policy-makers, and communities to develop practical, innovative ways of improving the quality of life in the places most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n\n\n\n"}

It saw its decline later during the next decade as its practices involved heavy drinking and unconventional sexual activities toward the end of its existence, which subsequently led to the conviction of 60 of its followers.\n\nThe grounds for the Korpela movement were laid in 1928 when Toivo Korpela, a self-proclaimed Laestadian preacher who had been rejected from his congregation in western Finland, started to travel around the Torne Valley to preach. The mainstream of the Laestadian movement were troubled by his activities and in 1931, it was openly suggested that Korpela could have \"succumbed to vice\" and that \"the authority of the word of god was endangered\" unless he changed his view on important matters of faith. When Korpela stopped preaching in 1934 due to his conflicting views with the Swedish Laestadian church, the movement survived without his leadership and new leaders emerged from inside the community.\n\nOne of the new leaders of the cult was Sigurd Siikavaara, who officially started the movement following Korpela's exile (thus the alternative name of the movement). More unorthodox elements such as apocalyptic beliefs and ecstatic rituals were introduced following the change of leadership. These beliefs and practices were later denounced by Korpela himself in an interview given in 1935. Following the involvement of Swedish authorities, Siikavaara was institutionalised in an asylum for 67 days, and upon his release the practices of the movement took a turn towards sexual rituals, which would ultimately lead to its demise.\n\nFollowing the radical change in practices, the Swedish government involved itself further, previously being tolerant toward religion, now targeting the sexual rituals, especially with concern for the involvement of minors. In 1939, police arrested 60 people, leading to the end of the movement, which at its peak had gained an estimated total of 600 followers.\n\nThe spiritual beliefs of the movement were initially similar to those of Laestadianism, although apparently not accepted by the Laestadian community as a whole, hence Korpela's initial reaction from central Finland.\n\nFollowing the exile of Korpela, his two closest preachers, Sigurd Siikavaara and Arthur Niemi began to introduce the belief that a flying ark would bring 666 true believers to Palestine and that the last 1,335 days of the world had begun, one date set for the arrival of the ark that was reported by newspapers at the time was March 14, 1935. It was later taught that the ark would not be an actual physical ark, but the spirit of Christ, granted to the followers of the Korpela movement. All claims and beliefs were more or less loosely based on interpretations of an old version of the Bible, as the new translation of the Bible at the time was preached as an abomination.\n\nFollowing Siikavaara and Niemi's brief confinement to mental asylums the beliefs and practices changed focus; Siikavaara claimed to have been invested with the spirit of the prophets and Christ, essentially proclaiming divine status, and gave the followers of the movement forgiveness for their sins, thus enabling them to engage in swearing, drinking, gambling and hitherto-prohibited sexual rituals. Upon his arrest in 1939, Siikavaara was an alcoholic and had allegedly engaged in sexual intercourse with 30 women other than his wife.\n\nThese facts have been questioned by relatives of Siikavaara who say that there actually were not any sexual rituals. Said rituals were merely rumours created by Laestadians, imagining the worst possible sins.\n\n\n"}

They are located primarily in an area of central Liberia extending into Guinea. They speak the Kpelle language, which belongs to the Mande language family.\n\nDespite their yearly heavy rainfalls and rough land, Kpelle survive mostly on their staple crop of rice. Culturally the Kpelle take a functional approach to life; they are organized under several paramount chiefs who serve as mediators for the public, preserve order and settle disputes. Their local economy rest on trade with local tribes. They are arguably the most rural and conservative of the major Liberian peoples.\n\nThe Kpelle are the largest ethnic group of the West African nation of Liberia and are also an important ethnic group also in southern Guinea (where they are also known as \"Guerze\") and north western Ivory Coast. Most Kpelle inhabit Bong County, Bomi County, Gbarpolu County, and Lofa County. They are major food suppliers of the capital cities.\n\nThe terrain in the area includes swamps, hills and, in lowland areas, rivers. May through October brings their rainy season with an annual rainfall from 180 to 300 centimeters. The Kpelle territory sees the lowest temperatures dropping to 19 degrees C with the average temp around 36 degree C.\n\nThe Kpelle people eat rice as their primary staple. It is supplemented by cassava, vegetables, and fruits; cash crops include rice, peanuts, sugarcane, and kola nuts they also enjoy fufu and soup, sometimes the soup is spicy but it depends on the way they want it. Soup may be eaten as an appetizer or in conjunction to the main dish.\n\nTraditionally, the Kpelle have been farmers with rice as the main crop. The word Kpelle is often used as an adjective to refer to someone as hard working and very humble people in Liberia and Guinea.\n\nTraditionally, a Kpelle family consists of a man, his wives and his children. The household has been the usual farming unit, and all the family members participate in daily farming work. Young children learn how to farm and help the older family members with farm activities.\n\nIn their social structure, leadership was very crucial. Every Kpelle tribe used to have a chief who oversaw their own interests as well as the interests of the society. These chiefs were recognized by the national government. They used to act as mediators between the government and their own tribes. Each town also had its own chief. The chiefs act as liaisons for different groups in the society. Anthropologists such as Caroline Bledsoe have characterized Kpelle social organization as one premised on wealth in people.\n\nTheir flight was due to internal conflicts between the tribes from the crumbling Sudanic empire.\n\nIn intelligence research, the Kpelle people perform differently from Westerners on sorting tasks. While Westerners tend to take a taxonomic approach, the Kpelle take a more functional approach. For example, instead of grouping food and tools into separate categories, a Kpelle participant stated, \"The knife goes with the orange because it cuts it\" (Glick 1975).\n\nThe Kpelle or Guerze lived in North Sudan during the sixteenth century, before fleeing to other parts of north west Africa into what is now Mali. Some migrated to Liberia, Mauritania, and Chad. They still maintained their traditional and cultural heritage despite their migration. A handful are still of Kpelle origin in North Sudan. They are mixed with the Nubians of the North Sudan where they remain a large minority.\n\nKpelle are also located in Mali and maintain their heritage. Some Arabs in Mali enslaved the Africans and took women as their concubines, with those descendants being of Kpelle admixture.\n\nThe Kpelle also used to trade with the Muslim Vai and Mandingo who live in small numbers in the country and reside nearby. The Kpelle trade with Lebanese merchants, U.S. missionaries and Peace Corps volunteers.\n\n"}

He attended Central High School in Memphis. His nickname came from his favorite weapon, a Thompson submachine gun. His most infamous crime was the kidnapping of oil tycoon and businessman Charles F. Urschel in July 1933 for which he, and his gang, collected a $200,000 ransom. Urschel had collected and left considerable evidence that assisted the subsequent FBI investigation which eventually led to Kelly's arrest in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 26, 1933. His crimes also included bootlegging and armed robbery.\n\nDuring the Prohibition era of the 1920s and 1930s Kelly worked as a bootlegger for himself as well as a colleague. After a short time, and several run-ins with the local Memphis police, he decided to leave town and head west with his girlfriend. To protect his family and to escape law enforcement officers, he changed his name to George R. Kelly. He continued to commit smaller crimes and bootlegging. He was arrested in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for smuggling liquor onto an Indian Reservation in 1928 and sentenced to three years at Leavenworth Penitentiary, Kansas, beginning February 11, 1928. He was reportedly a model inmate and was released early. Shortly thereafter, Kelly married Kathryn Thorne, an experienced criminal who purchased Kelly's first machine gun, insisted- despite his lack of interest in weapons- on target practice in the countryside, and went to great lengths to familiarize his name within underground crime circles.\n\nNonetheless, Kelly's last criminal activity – the successful July 1933 kidnapping of wealthy Oklahoma City resident, Charles F. Urschel and his friend Walter R. Jarrett – would become his undoing. The Kellys demanded a ransom of $200,000 ($ million today), and held Urschel at the farm of Kathryn's mother and step-father. Urschel, having been blindfolded, made note of evidence of his experience including remembering background sounds, counting footsteps and leaving fingerprints on surfaces in reach. This proved invaluable for the FBI in its investigation, as agents concluded that Urschel had been held in Paradise, Texas, based on sounds that Urschel remembered hearing while he was being held hostage.\n\nAn investigation conducted at Memphis disclosed that the Kellys were living at the residence of J. C. Tichenor. Special agents from Birmingham, Alabama, were immediately dispatched to Memphis, where, in the early morning hours of September 26, 1933, a raid was conducted. George and Kathryn Kelly were taken into custody by FBI agents and Memphis police. Caught without a weapon, George Kelly allegedly cried, \"Don't shoot, G-Men! Don't shoot, G-Men!\" as he surrendered to FBI agents. The term, which had applied to all federal investigators, became synonymous with FBI agents. The couple was immediately removed to Oklahoma City.\n\nThe arrest of the Kellys was overshadowed by the escape of ten inmates, including all of the members of the future Dillinger gang, from the penitentiary in Michigan City, Indiana, that same night.\n\nOn October 12, 1933, George and Kathryn Kelly were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial was held at the Post Office, Courthouse and Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City.\n\nAn investigation in Coleman, Texas, disclosed that the Kellys had been housed and protected by Cassey Earl Coleman and Will Casey, and that Coleman had assisted George Kelly in storing $73,250 of the Urschel ransom money on his ranch. This money was located by Bureau agents in the early morning hours of September 27 in a cotton patch on Coleman's ranch. They were both indicted at Dallas, Texas, on October 4, 1933, charged with harboring a fugitive and conspiracy, and on October 17, 1933, Coleman, after entering a plea of guilty, was sentenced to serve one year and one day, and Casey after trial and conviction, was sentenced to serve two years in the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nThe kidnapping of Urschel and the two trials that resulted were historic in several ways. They were: \n\nMachine Gun Kelly spent his remaining 21 years in prison. During his time at Alcatraz he got the nickname \"Pop Gun Kelly\". This was in reference, according to a former prisoner, that Kelly was a model prisoner and was nowhere near the tough, brutal gangster his wife made him out to be. He spent 17 years on Alcatraz as inmate number 117, working in the prison industries, and boasting of and exaggerating his past escapades to other inmates, and was quietly transferred back to Leavenworth in 1951. He died of a heart attack at Leavenworth on July 18, 1954, his 59th birthday, and is buried at Cottondale Texas Cemetery with a small headstone marked \"George B. Kelley 1954\". Kathryn Kelly was released from prison in 1958 and lived in relative anonymity in Oklahoma under the assumed name \"Lera Cleo Kelly\" until her death in 1985 at the age of 81.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly and his crimes are portrayed in films such as \"Machine-Gun Kelly\" (1958), \"The FBI Story\" (1959) and \"\" (1974).\n\nCrime novelist Ace Atkins' 2010 book \"Infamous\" is based on the Urschel kidnapping and George and Kathryn Kelly. Kelly is (along with Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson) one of the main characters of the comic book series \"Pretty, Baby, Machine\".\n\nGeorge and Kathryn Kelly were the inspiration for \"Machine Gun Kelly\" (1970), a song written by Danny \"Kootch\" Kortchmar and recorded by James Taylor on his 1971 album \"Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon\". Machine Gun Kelly is the stage name for an American rapper from Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n\n"}

There were a number of Malay kingdoms in Indonesia that covered the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan, such as Srivijaya, Melayu Kingdom, Sultanate of Deli, Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura, Riau-Lingga Sultanate, Sultanate of Bulungan, Pontianak Sultanate, and the Sultanate of Sambas.\n\nThere have been various Malay kingdoms based on the island of Sumatra: the Melayu Kingdom, Srivijaya, Sultanate of Deli, Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura and the Riau-Lingga Sultanate.\n\nIn the Pontianak incidents during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese massacred most of the Malay elite and beheaded all of the Malay Sultans in Kalimantan.\n\nDuring the Fall of Suharto, there was a resurgence in Malay nationalism and identity in Kalimantan and ethnic Malays and Dayaks in Sambas massacred Madurese during the Sambas riots.\n\nSumatra is the homeland of the Malay languages, which today spans all corners of Insular Southeast Asia. The Indonesian language which is the country's official language and lingua franca was based on Riau-Lingga (or Johor-Riau) Malay. The Malay language has a long history, which has a literary record as far back as the 7th century AD. A famous early Malay inscription, the Kedukan Bukit Inscription, was discovered by the Dutchman M. Batenburg on 29 November 1920, at Kedukan Bukit, South Sumatra, on the banks of the River Tatang, a tributary of the River Musi. It is a small stone of 45 by 80 cm. It is written in Old Malay, a possible ancestor of today's Malay language and its variants. Most Malay languages and dialects spoken in Indonesia are mutually unintelligible to Standard Indonesian. The most widely spoken are Palembang Malay (3.2 million), Jambi Malay (1 million), Bengkulu Malay (1.6 million) and Banjarese (4 million) (although not considered to be a dialect of Malay by its speakers; its minor dialect is typically called Bukit Malay). Besides the proper Malay languages, there are several languages closely related to Malay such as Minangkabau, Kerinci, Kubu and others. These languages are closely related to Malay, but their speakers do not consider their languages to be Malay. There are many Malay-based creoles spoken in the country especially in eastern Indonesia due to contacts from the western part of Indonesia and during colonial rule where Malay replaced Dutch as a lingua franca. The most well-known Malay creoles in Indonesia are Ambonese Malay, Betawi, Manado Malay and Papuan Malay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49970297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49970297", "title": "Meanness", "text": "Meanness\n\nMeanness is a personal quality whose classical form, discussed by many from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas, characterizes it as a vice of \"lowness\", but whose modern form deals more with cruelty.\n\nIn his dictionary, Noah Webster defined meanness as \"want of excellence\", \"want of rank\", \"low estate\", \"lowness of mind\", and \"sordidness, niggardliness, opposed to liberality or charitableness\" pointing out that \"meanness is very different from frugality\". These, in particular the final one, largely summarize the aspects of the classical definition of meanness that have been propounded by philosophers, Aristotelian and otherwise, over the centuries.\n\nIn his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", where each virtue is considered as a midway point on a continuum bracketed by two vices, Aristotle places meanness as one of the two vices that bracket the virtue of liberality/generosity. It is the deficiency of giving to or the excess of taking from others. The other vice is prodigality (excess of giving to or deficiency of taking from), which Aristotle describes as both less common than meanness and less of a vice.\n\nMeanness can take many forms, as there are several ways in which one can deviate from the liberal/generous virtue. It can be a desire for wealth with insufficient desire to benefit others; or a desire to benefit others suppressed by an excessive desire to keep what money one has; or the desire for too much wealth. Aristotle said that \"meanness we always impute to those who care more than they ought for wealth\" and \"there seem to be many kinds of meanness\".\n\nThe translation of what Aristotle meant is not without problems. Aristotle's actual word \"ἐλευθερία\" (eleutheria) corresponds with both liberality and freedom. Its opposite, \"ανἐλευθερία\", is both meanness and servility. Philosophers such as Susanne E. Foster (in ) have attempted to reconcile these by explaining that the connotation is that meanness is enslavement by one's material possessions. A slave has no possessions to give and is not the recipient of gifts from others; whereas a free person, in a gift-exchanging culture, can give and take freely. Meanness, therefore, is the vice of a free person behaving, in such a culture, as a slave does.\n\nAnother problem that has taxed philosophers analysing Aristotle is that the expected continuum (on which vices and a virtue lie) is from excess to deficiency; but Aristotle describes meanness as \"both\" excess (of taking from) \"and\" deficiency (of giving to). Philosophers have attempted to explain this, and characterize what Aristotle was trying to say as an excess or a deficiency in some other form. Howard J. Curzer takes the view that in fact both were meant, and that it is \"misguided\" to ask whether Aristotelian meanness is excess or deficiency, because what constitutes excess and what constitutes deficiency \"depends upon how the parameters are described\" and is \"purely a verbal matter\". Exactly which vice of the two that brackets a virtue is \"excess\" and which is \"deficiency\" is entirely arbitrary.\n\nCurzer also contends that Aristotle's statement that meanness is worse than prodigality is \"a mistake\", based upon an erroneous choice of exemplars of prodigality. There are, in Curzer's contention \"true prodigals\", who are not merely young and foolish (as Aristotle would have prodigals be, and arguing thereby that youth and foolishness are curable — the former by simple dint of growing old — whereas meanness is not) but \"incurably wicked\" and thus more proper exemplars of the vice, who demonstrate that it is just as much of a vice as meanness is.\n\nIn his \"Summa Theologica\" , Thomas Aquinas explicitly cited Aristotle (as \"The Philosopher\") and held meanness — \"parvificentia\" in his original Latin — to be the opposite of magnificence (\"magnificentia\"). Whilst a magnificent person is willing to pay for great projects and good causes, a mean person focuses upon penny-pinching and settles for small goals at the expense of great ones.\n\nTheodore Parker, like Aristotle, opposed meanness and generosity, declaring meanness as an \"unmanly and unwomanly vice\". He differentiated two forms of meanness: \"pecuniary meanness\", which is meanness in things measurable with money, and \"meanness of behaviour\", which is meanness in things not thus measurable.\n\nGeorge Crabb described meanness as \"[w]hatever a man does in common with those below him\" and that \"evinces a temper that is prone to sink rather than rise in the scale of society\". He considered meanness to be only relatively bad, as what may constitute meanness for one person may be generosity or prudence for another. Seeking to save or to gain for oneself at the expense of others, in particular with respect to what one can afford to pay, \"is denominated a mean temper\".\n\nHenry Sidgwick in \"The Methods of Ethics\" held meanness to be both the opposite of liberality and generosity. A mean person \"chooses a trifling gain to himself rather than the avoidance of disappointment to others\", and meanness is not injustice per se.\n\nSamuel Johnson wrote in \"The False Alarm\" that \"[a]n infallible characteristic of meanness is cruelty\". Linda Zagzebski stated that meanness is \"an acquired defect\" that is \"opposed to kindness\". These signifiy the modern view of meanness, which has concentrated upon cruelty, bullying, and remorselessness.\n\nIn the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, one of the several ways of defining what psychopathy is, meanness is one of the three components, an index of a person's \"callous aggression\". It is characterized as callous unemotionality, antagonism, coldheartedness, exploitativeness, remorselessness, and empowerment through cruelty; encompassing destructive acts, the inability to bond with other people, bullying, fight-picking, and other forms of active engagement against other people (in contrast to social withdrawal, which is a passive moving away from other people).\n\nMany of these aspects of meanness — namely empowerment, bullying, aggression, cruelty, and ruthlessness — have been incorporated in the late 20th and early 21st century popular cultural concept of the \"mean girl\". Social science professor Valerie Walkerdine argues that \"meanness is becoming a dominant motif for Western girlhood\", as it fits well with the normative, repressive, boundaries of what is appropriate to modern femininity in work and school, and supports the narrative that empowered, successful, females cannot treat empowerment and success positively, but rather always risk slipping into cruelty. With sociology professor Jessica Ringrose she contends that the \"mean girl\" stereotype from popular culture, as supported by what they criticise as \"highly suspect\" research in developmental psychology, is being increasingly taken up by policy makers in education. And that in turn, with things like the Hollywood movie \"Mean Girls\" being partly based upon the self-help book \"Queen Bees and Wannabes\" by Rosalind Wiseman, feeds from psychology and pedagogy back into popular culture.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29873266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29873266", "title": "Mir Nooruddin Mengal", "text": "Mir Nooruddin Mengal\n\nMir Noor-ud-din Mengal (; 13 July 1952 – 13 October 2010) was a senior Baloch politician who was active in Balochistan's political scene for nearly four decades, from 1970 to 2010. He belonged to the famed Zagar Mengal tribe and was the nephew of the Baloch National Poet Mir Gul Khan Nasir. His father's name was Mir Lal Bakhsh Mengal and he had seven siblings. His mother was a prominent member of the Gichki family from Mekran.\n\nMir Noor-ud-din was named after Sardar Noordin Mengal (an uncle of Sardar Attaullah Mengal and a close friend of Mir Lal Baksh Mengal who died in a road traffic accident near Kalat). He was brought up in his hometown of Kalat. His father was a prominent tribal and political figure of Balochistan while his uncle Gul Khan Nasir belonged to the top tier Baloch leadership along with Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Abdul Aziz Kurd and, later, Sardar Ataullah Khan Mengal and Khair Bux Marri. As a result of this he was exposed to politics from a very early age. This exposure instilled a nascent sense of political awareness in him which, with age, kept growing.\n\nMengal passed high school from Kalat and after matriculating from Noshki, enrolled in F.Sc Pre-Engineering in Government Science College, Quetta.\n\nAfter he had finished college, Gul Khan Nasir advised Mengal to get into a university instead of just relying on a college degree. Following his uncle's advice, he applied to Patrice Lumumba University and was accepted. Mengal had chosen a University in Moscow because at that time it was a very common practice for Baloch students to go to Russia in pursuit of a higher education but because of his political activities (which he had already begun by 1970 from Baloch Students Organization's (BSO) platform) his name was put on the Exit Control List and he was unable to go.\n\nWith that door closed, Mengal applied for Mining Engineering at University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore in 1973 and was, once again, accepted. He spent four years in Lahore and graduated with a B.E Degree in 1977.\n\nThroughout his student life, Mengal had been active in politics and from 1974 to 1976 had served as BSO's Vice Chairman. During his time in Lahore he had opened sixteen units of BSO in different cities of Punjab. After returning to Quetta he served a second term as the Vice Chairman of BSO from 1978 to 1980 and while he managed to secure a job as a Mining Engineer in a private mining company, his political life remained dominant over his professional life. So much so, in fact, that he eventually quit his job to devote all his time and energy to politics.\n\nAfter serving his second term as the Vice Chairman of BSO, he joined the political party of Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, The Pakistan National Party. After Mir Ghaus Bakhsh's death in August 1989, the leadership of the party shifted to Mir Bizen Bizenjo but he wasn't able to hold on to it for long. When Mir Bizen vacated the office of the Party President, PNP was thrown into turmoil. During this tumultuous time the position of Party Organizer was also vacant, so Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was named the Organizer of the Party. After successfully organizing the council session of PNP where Mir Hasil Bizenjo was named President, Mengal went back to being the Deputy Organizer of the Party while Raziq Bugti became the Organizer. A few months after this, in 1992, Mir Noor-ud-din was elected as the Vice President of PNP, an office he held until the merger of PNP with BNM in 1996.\n\nBy 1996 it seemed that no single political party was able to represent the whole Province of Balochistan. In light of this discussions began between the leaders of Pakistan National Party and Baloch National Movement. Mengal played a central role in these talks and was pivotal in the merger of the two parties to form Balochistan National Party. Mir Noor-ud-din was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee of BNP after the merger and held the position until his death in October 2010.\n\nMengal remained an active and loyal member of the BNP right up until his death. When the Balochistan National Party was split into two factions, i.e., BNP Awami which was a forward block led by Israr Zehri, and BNP which was led by Akhtar Mengal, Mir Noor-ud-din remained in BNP proving his loyalty. He set up his political base in his hometown of Kalat and was arrested and persecuted for his political beliefs numerous times from 2000 to 2007 . In 2006, Balochistan National Party announced a Long March against, what they termed, the continued exploitation of the Baloch land and people by the Establishment especially during the dictatorship of General Pervez Musharaff. The long march was to start from Gwadar and culminate at Quetta. Before the long march could even begin, the Government launched a crackdown against the BNP Leaders. Party President Akhtar Mengal was the first to be arrested triggering protests throughout Balochistan. After Akhtar Mengal's arrest Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was chosen as the Acting President of BNP. On 3 January 2007 he too was arrested while en route to Khuzdar to meet incarcerated party workers. Political cases under 16 M.P.O were registered against him and he was put under physical remand in Quetta for a month after which he was shifted to Khuzdar Jail where he was detained for four more months.\n\nAfter being released, Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal began preparing to take part in the upcoming 2008 elections. He submitted his papers for the National Assembly Seat from Kalat but the All Parties Democratic Movement (APDM, an alliance of several political parties against General Musharaff's regime) announced to boycott the elections and since BNP was also a part of APDM, therefore all the BNP candidates withdrew their candidacy.\n\nAkhtar Mengal was released in 2008 after a change of regime and went to Dubai for treatment of a disease he had contracted while in detention. So in his absence the party was being run by Habib Jalib Baloch, Dr Jahanzaib Jamaldini and Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal. In 2010 the BNP Leaders began receiving death threats and the threats were put into action for the first time when a BNP worker, Naseer Langove, was murdered in May 2010. A group named Baloch Musallah Difaee Tanzeem (Baloch Armed Defence Organization) claimed the responsibility for the murder and issued a statement claiming that their intended target had been Habib Jalib. On 14 July 2010 the shadow organization struck again, this time succeeding in assassinating Jalib in front of his house in Quetta. Only four days later another BNP Leader Haji Liaquat Mengal was assassinated near his house in Kalat.\n\nAfter the death of Habib Jalib Mir Noor-ud-din Mengal was the man directing the affairs of Balochistan National Party in the absence of Akhtar Mengal and he was also one of the few top leaders of the party who wasn't keeping private security guards with him. On 13 October 2010 he had gone to the market in Kalat to get his Blood Pressure checked. As soon as he got back and turned his car into the gate of his house, unknown gunmen riding a motorcycle came up behind him and opened indiscriminate fire upon him. He was hit by three bullets; One in the neck and two in the back. He was immediately rushed to the local hospital but none of the doctors who were supposed to be on duty were there. Mengal was sent to Quetta without being given basic first aid. He died on the way to Quetta due to profuse bleeding. He had been conscious for nearly 75 minutes after being shot. As the news of his death spread in Balochistan, the traffic began thinning on the roads from the fear of riots erupting. Mengal was buried beside his father's grave in Kalat the same evening. Hundreds of people flocked to attend his funeral.\n\nHis death was assailed by all the local and national political parties such as the Pakistan National Party, the Awami National Party, Pakhtun-khwa Milli Awami Party, Balochistan National Party, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz, Pakistan Muslim League Quaid-i Azam, the Baloch National Front, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam and the Pakistan People's Party. On 14 and 15 October all the main cities of Balochistan remained closed to mourn Mengal's death. Strikes were also observed on the National Highway by BNP and BNF over Mir Noor-ud-din's assassination.\n\nAfter his death, a congregation was held to pay tribute to Mir Noor-ud-din by BNP where he was given the title \"Shaheed i Watan\" or \"The Nation's Martyr\".\n"}

{"id": "37201518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37201518", "title": "Plastic pollution", "text": "Plastic pollution\n\nPlastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects(e.g.: plastic bottles and much more) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat and humans. Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size. Plastics are inexpensive and durable, and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. Moreover, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment.\n\nPlastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. Living organisms, particularly marine animals, can be harmed either by mechanical effects, such as entanglement in plastic objects or problems related to ingestion of plastic waste, or through exposure to chemicals within plastics that interfere with their physiology. Humans are also affected by plastic pollution, such as through disruption of various hormonal mechanisms.\n\nAs of 2018, about 380 million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year. From the 1950s up to 2018, an estimated 6.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced worldwide, of which an estimated 9% has been recycled and another 12% has been incinerated. In the UK alone, more than 5 million tonnes of plastic are consumed each year, of which only an estimated one-quarter is recycled, with the remainder going to landfills. This large amount of plastic waste inevitably enters the environment, with studies suggesting that the bodies of 90% of seabirds contain plastic debris. In some areas there have been significant efforts to reduce the prominence of plastic pollution, through reducing plastic consumption and promoting plastic recycling.\n\nSome researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight.\n\nThere are three major forms of plastic that contribute to plastic pollution: microplastics as well as mega- and macro-plastics. Mega- and micro plastics have accumulated in highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, concentrated around urban centers and water fronts. Plastic can be found off the coast of some islands because of currents carrying the debris. Both mega- and macro-plastics are found in packaging, footwear, and other domestic items that have been washed off of ships or discarded in landfills. Fishing-related items are more likely to be found around remote islands. These may also be referred to as micro-, meso-, and macro debris.\n\nPlastic debris is categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary plastics are in their original form when collected. Examples of these would be bottle caps, cigarette butts, and microbeads. Secondary plastics, on the other hand, account for smaller plastics that have resulted from the degradation of primary plastics.\n\nMicrodebris are plastic pieces between 2 mm and 5 mm in size. Plastic debris that starts off as meso- or macrodebris can become microdebris through degradation and collisions that break it down into smaller pieces. Microdebris is more commonly referred to as nurdles. Nurdles are recycled to make new plastic items, but they easily end up released into the environment during production because of their small size. They often end up in ocean waters through rivers and streams. Microdebris that come from cleaning and cosmetic products are also referred to as scrubbers. Because microdebris and scrubbers are so small in size, filter-feeding organisms often consume them.\n\nPrimary microplastics, a type of microdebris, known as Nurdles enter the ocean by means of spills during transportation or from land based sources. These micro-plastics can accumulate in the oceans and allow for the accumulation of Persistent Bio-accumulating Toxins such as DDT and PCB's which are hydrophobic in nature and can cause adverse health affects.\n\nA 2004 study by Richard Thompson from the University of Plymouth, UK, found a great amount of microdebris on the beaches and waters in Europe, the Americas, Australia, Africa, and Antarctica. Thompson and his associates found that plastic pellets from both domestic and industrial sources were being broken down into much smaller plastic pieces, some having a diameter smaller than human hair. If not ingested, this microdebris floats instead of being absorbed into the marine environment. Thompson predicts there may be 300,000 plastic items/km of sea surface and 100,000 plastic particles/km of seabed. International pellet watch collected samples of polythene pellets from 30 beaches from 17 countries which were then analysed for organic micro-pollutants. It was found that pellets found on beaches in America, Vietnam and southern Africa contained compounds from pesticides suggesting a high use of pesticides in the areas.\n\nPlastic debris is categorized as macrodebris when it is larger than 20 mm. These include items such as plastic grocery bags. Macrodebris are often found in ocean waters, and can have a serious impact on the native organisms. Fishing nets have been prime pollutants. Even after they have been abandoned, they continue to trap marine organisms and other plastic debris. Eventually, these abandoned nets become too difficult to remove from the water because they become too heavy, having grown in weight up to 6 tons.\n\nPlastics themselves contribute to approximately 10% of discarded waste. Many kinds of plastics exist depending on their precursors and the method for their polymerization. Depending on their chemical composition, plastics and resins have varying properties related to contaminant absorption and adsorption. Polymer degradation takes much longer as a result of saline environments and the cooling effect of the sea. These factors contribute to the persistence of plastic debris in certain environments. Recent studies have shown that plastics in the ocean decompose faster than was once thought, due to exposure to sun, rain, and other environmental conditions, resulting in the release of toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A. However, due to the increased volume of plastics in the ocean, decomposition has slowed down. The Marine Conservancy has predicted the decomposition rates of several plastic products. It is estimated that a foam plastic cup will take 50 years, a plastic beverage holder will take 400 years, a disposable nappy will take 450 years, and fishing line will take 600 years to degrade.\n\nIt was estimated that global production of plastics is approximately 250 mt/yr. Their abundance has been found to transport persistent organic pollutants, also known as POPs. These pollutants have been linked to an increased distribution of algae associated with red tides.\nThe distribution of plastic debris is highly variable as a result of certain factors such as wind and ocean currents, coastline geography, urban areas, and trade routes. Human population in certain areas also plays a large role in this. Plastics are more likely to be found in enclosed regions such as the Caribbean. It serves as a means of distribution of organisms to remote coasts that are not their native environments. This could potentially increase the variability and dispersal of organisms in specific areas that are less biologically diverse. Plastics can also be used as vectors for chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals.\n\nChlorinated plastic can release harmful chemicals into the surrounding soil, which can then seep into groundwater or other surrounding water sources and also the ecosystem of the world. This can cause serious harm to the species that drink the water.\n\nLandfill areas contain many different types of plastics. In these landfills, there are many microorganisms which speed up the biodegradation of plastics. The microorganisms include bacteria such as \"Pseudomonas\", nylon-eating bacteria, and Flavobacteria. These bacteria break down nylon through the activity of the nylonase enzyme. Breakdown of biodegradable plastics releases methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming.\n\nIn 2012, it was estimated that there was approximately 165 million tons of plastic pollution in the world's oceans. One type of plastic that is of concern in terms of ocean plastic pollution is nurdles. Nurdles are manufactured plastic pellets (a type of microplastic) used in the creation of plastic products and are often shipped via cargo ship. Many billions of nurdles are spilled into oceans each year, and it has been estimated that globally, around 10% of beach litter consists of nurdles. Plastics in oceans typically degrade within a year, but not entirely. In the process, toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A and polystyrene can leach into waters from some plastics. Polystyrene pieces and nurdles are the most common types of plastic pollution in oceans, and combined with plastic bags and food containers make up the majority of oceanic debris.\n\nOne study estimated that there are more than 5 trillion plastic pieces (defined into the four classes of small microplastics, large microplastics, meso- and macroplastics) afloat at sea.\n\nThe litter that is being delivered into the oceans is toxic to marine life, and humans. The toxins that are components of plastic include diethylhexyl phthalate, which is a toxic carcinogen, as well as lead, cadmium, and mercury.\n\nPlankton, fish, and ultimately the human race, through the food chain, ingest these highly toxic carcinogens and chemicals. Consuming the fish that contain these toxins can cause an increase in cancer, immune disorders, and birth defects.\n\nThe majority of the litter near and in the ocean is made up of plastics and is a persistent pervasive source of marine pollution. According to Dr. Marcus Eriksen of The 5 Gyres Institute, there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastic pollution that weigh as much as 270,000 tons (2016). This plastic is taken by the ocean currents and accumulates in large vortexes known as ocean gyres. The majority of the gyres become pollution dumps filled with plastic.\n\nAlmost 20% of plastic debris that pollutes ocean water, which translates to 5.6 million tons, comes from ocean-based sources. Merchant ships expel cargo, sewage, used medical equipment, and other types of waste that contain plastic into the ocean. Naval and research vessels eject waste and military equipment that are deemed unnecessary. Pleasure crafts release fishing gear and other types of waste, either accidentally or through negligent handling. The largest ocean-based source of plastic pollution is discarded fishing gear (including traps and nets), estimated to be up to 90% of plastic debris in some areas.\n\nContinental plastic litter enters the ocean largely through storm-water runoff, flowing into watercourses or directly discharged into coastal waters. Plastic in the ocean has been shown to follow ocean currents which eventually form into what is known as Great Garbage Patches. Knowledge of the routes that plastic follows in ocean currents comes from accidental container drops from ship carriers. For example, in May 1990 The Hansa Carrier, sailing from Korea to the United States, broke apart due to a storm, ultimately resulting in thousands of dumped shoes; these eventually started showing up on the U.S western coast, and Hawaii.\n\nThe amount of plastic pollution accumulating in the oceans is estimated at over five trillion pieces floating in the waters. This paper provides an overview of the amount of plastic pollution in the world’s waterways, and why it is there. Researching credible sources on this topic aided in answering the research question: \n“what would it take to reduce the amount of plastic in the ocean?” \nThe findings suggest businesses to replace 50%, or more, of their common plastic products with biodegradable, or compostable, items because of the following:\nThe main type of plastic being used by businesses is petroleum-based plastics. Businesses should switch to compostable items which break down within 90 days and do not leave a toxic residue (EPA, 2018a). The effect of plastic waste in the ocean has a negative impact on animal life, as well as, the coral reefs. The oceans are filled with harmful plastics which are being digested and entangled by sea life on a daily basis (Dissanayake, 2016). Single-use items are contributing to the amount of plastic found in the five ocean gyres. There were over 260,000 tons of plastic debris in the ocean in 2013 (Eriksen et al., 2014). The problem with single-use items is the waste it involves. While it is very convenient to the consumer and provider to have access to disposable items, it poses a significant problem in landfills and waterway volumes. Industrialized countries need to take aggressive action on the types of plastic being used, or evoke a monetary discipline (Dissanayake, 2016). By creating legislative mandates for recycling, ocean life may be able to thrive, and human life may be able to improve from a healthier environment.\nUsing existing resources to convert from petroleum-based plastics to bioplastics. These conclusions identified a potential solution in reducing plastic pollution. With education and awareness, people can begin to clean the rivers and waters, and make them a safe place for sea animals to live.\n\nEstimates for the contribution of land-based plastic vary widely. While one study estimated that a little over 80% of plastic debris in ocean water comes from land-based sources, responsible for every year. In 2015, Jambeck et al. calculated that of plastic waste was generated in 192 coastal countries in 2010, with 4.8 to entering the ocean - a percentage of only up to 5%.\n\nIn a study published by \"Science\", Jambeck \"et al\" (2015) estimated that the 10 largest emitters of oceanic plastic pollution worldwide are, from the most to the least, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, and Bangladesh.\n\nA source that has caused concern is landfills. Most waste in the form of plastic in landfills are single-use items such as packaging. Discarding plastics this way leads to accumulation. Although disposing of plastic waste in landfills has less of a gas emission risk than disposal through incineration, the former has space limitations. Another concern is that the liners acting as protective layers between the landfill and environment can break, thus leaking toxins and contaminating the nearby soil and water. Landfills located near oceans often contribute to ocean debris because content is easily swept up and transported to the sea by wind or small waterways like rivers and streams. Marine debris can also result from sewage water that has not been efficiently treated, which is eventually transported to the ocean through rivers. Plastic items that have been improperly discarded can also be carried to oceans through storm waters.\n\nIn the Pacific Gyre, specifically 20°N-40°N latitude, large bodies with floating marine debris can be found. Models of wind patterns and ocean currents indicate that the plastic waste in the northern Pacific is particularly dense where the Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ), 23°N-37°N latitude, meets a southwest-northeast line, found north of the Hawaiian archipelago.\n\nIn the Pacific, there are two mass buildups: the western garbage patch and the eastern garbage patch, the former off the coast of Japan and the latter between Hawaii and California. The two garbage patches are both part of the great Pacific garbage patch, and are connected through a section of plastic debris off the northern coast of the Hawaiian islands. It is approximated that these garbage patches contain 100 million tons of debris. The waste is not compact, and although most of it is near the surface of the pacific, it can be found up to more than 100 feet deep in the water.\n\nResearch published in April 2017 reported \"the highest density of plastic rubbish anywhere in the world\" on remote and uninhabited Henderson Island in South Pacific as a result of the South Pacific Gyre. The beaches contain an estimated 37.7 million items of debris together weighing 17.6 tonnes. In a study transect on North Beach, each day 17 to 268 new items washed up on a 10-metre section. The study noted that purple hermit crabs (\"Coenobita spinosus\") make their homes in plastic containers washed up on beaches.\n\nA 2017 study found that 83% of tap water samples taken around the world contained plastic pollutants. This was the first study to focus on global drinking water pollution with plastics, and showed that with a contamination rate of 94%, tap water in the United States was the most polluted, followed by Lebanon and India. European countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany and France had the lowest contamination rate, though still as high as 72%. This means that people may be ingesting between 3,000 and 4,000 microparticles of plastic from tap water per year. The analysis found particles of more than 2.5 microns in size, which is 2500 times bigger than a nanometer. It is currently unclear if this contamination is affecting human health, but if the water is also found to contain nano-particle pollutants, there could be adverse impacts on human well-being, according to scientists associated with the study.\n\nHowever, plastic tap water pollution remains under-studied, as are the links of how pollution transfers between humans, air, water, and soil.\n\nPlastic pollution has the potential to poison animals, which can then adversely affect human food supplies. Plastic pollution has been described as being highly detrimental to large marine mammals, described in the book \"Introduction to Marine Biology\" as posing the \"single greatest threat\" to them. Some marine species, such as sea turtles, have been found to contain large proportions of plastics in their stomach. When this occurs, the animal typically starves, because the plastic blocks the animal's digestive tract. Sometimes Marine mammals are entangled in plastic products such as nets, which can harm or kill them.\n\nEntanglement in plastic debris has been responsible for the deaths of many marine organisms, such as fish, seals, turtles, and birds. These animals get caught in the debris and end up suffocating or drowning. Because they are unable to untangle themselves, they also die from starvation or from their inability to escape predators. Being entangled also often results in severe lacerations and ulcers. In a 2006 report known as \"Plastic Debris in the World's Oceans\", it was estimated that at least 267 different animal species have suffered from entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris. It has been estimated that over 400,000 marine mammals perish annually due to plastic pollution in oceans. Marine organisms get caught in discarded fishing equipment, such as ghost nets. Ropes and nets used to fish are often made of synthetic materials such as nylon, making fishing equipment more durable and buoyant. These organisms can also get caught in circular plastic packaging materials, and if the animal continues to grow in size, the plastic can cut into their flesh. Equipment such as nets can also drag along the seabed, causing damage to coral reefs.\n\nSea turtles are affected by plastic pollution. Some species are consumers of jelly fish, but often mistake plastic bags for their natural prey. This plastic debris can kill the sea turtle by obstructing the oesophagus. So too are whales; large amounts of plastics have been found in the stomachs of beached whales In June 2018, more than 80 plastic bags were found inside a dying pilot whale that washed up on the shores of Thailand.\n\nSome of the tiniest bits of plastic are being consumed by small fish, in a part of the pelagic zone in the ocean called the \"Mesopelagic zone\", which is 200 to 1000 metres below the ocean surface, and completely dark. Not much is known about these fish, other than that there are many of them. They hide in the darkness of the ocean, avoiding predators and then swimming to the ocean's surface at night to feed. Plastics found in the stomachs of these fish were collected during \"Malaspina's circumnavigation\", a research project that studies the impact of global change on the oceans.\n\nA study conducted by Scripps Institution of Oceanography showed that the average plastic content in the stomachs of 141 mesopelagic fish over 27 different species was 9.2%. Their estimate for the ingestion rate of plastic debris by these fish in the North Pacific was between 12000 and 24000 tons per year. The most popular mesopelagic fish is the lantern fish. It resides in the central ocean gyres, a large system of rotating ocean currents. Since lantern fish serve as a primary food source for the fish that consumers purchase, including tuna and swordfish, the plastics they ingest become part of the food chain. The lantern fish is one of the main bait fish in the ocean, and it eats large amounts of plastic fragments, which in turn will not make them nutritious enough for other fish to consume.\n\nDeep sea animals have been found with plastics in their stomachs.\n\nPlastic pollution does not only affect animals that live solely in oceans. Seabirds are also greatly affected. In 2004, it was estimated that gulls in the North Sea had an average of thirty pieces of plastic in their stomachs. Seabirds often mistake trash floating on the ocean's surface as prey. Their food sources often has already ingested plastic debris, thus transferring the plastic from prey to predator. Ingested trash can obstruct and physically damage a bird's digestive system, reducing its digestive ability and can lead to malnutrition, starvation, and death. Toxic chemicals called \"polychlorinated biphenyls\" (PCBs) also become concentrated on the surface of plastics at sea and are released after seabirds eat them. These chemicals can accumulate in body tissues and have serious lethal effects on a bird's reproductive ability, immune system, and hormone balance. Floating plastic debris can produce ulcers, infections and lead to death. Marine plastic pollution can even reach birds that have never been at the sea. Parents may accidentally feed their nestlings plastic, mistaking it for food. Seabird chicks are the most vulnerable to plastic ingestion since they can't vomit up their food like the adult seabirds.\n\nAfter the initial observation that many of the beaches in New Zealand had high concentrations of plastic pellets, further studies found that different species of prion ingest the plastic debris. Hungry prions mistook these pellets for food, and these particles were found intact within the birds' gizzards and proventriculi. Pecking marks similar to those made by northern fulmars in cuttlebones have been found in plastic debris, such as styrofoam, on the beaches on the Dutch coast, showing that this species of bird also mistake plastic debris for food.\n\nAn estimate of 1.5 million Laysan albatrosses, which inhabit Midway Atoll, all have plastics in their digestive system. Midway Atoll is halfway between Asia and North America, and north of the Hawaiian archipelago. In this remote location, the plastic blockage has proven deadly to these birds. These seabirds choose red, pink, brown, and blue plastic pieces because of similarities to their natural food sources. As a result of plastic ingestion, the digestive tract can be blocked resulting in starvation. The windpipe can also be blocked, which results in suffocation. The debris can also accumulate in the animal's gut, and give them a false sense of fullness which would also result in starvation. On the shore, thousands of birds corpses can be seen with plastic remaining where the stomach once was. The durability of the plastics is visible among the remains. In some instances, the plastic piles are still present while the bird's corpse has decayed.\n\nSimilar to humans, animals exposed to plasticizers can experience developmental defects. Specifically, sheep have been found to have lower birth weights when prenatally exposed to bisphenol A. Exposure to BPA can shorten the distance between the eyes of a tadpole. It can also stall development in frogs and can result in a decrease in body length. In different species of fish, exposure can stall egg hatching and result in a decrease in body weight, tail length, and body length.\n\nDue to the use of chemical additives during plastic production, plastics have potentially harmful effects that could prove to be carcinogenic or promote endocrine disruption. Some of the additives are used as phthalate plasticizers and brominated flame retardants. Through biomonitoring, chemicals in plastics, such as BPA and phthalates, have been identified in the human population. Humans can be exposed to these chemicals through the nose, mouth, or skin. Although the level of exposure varies depending on age and geography, most humans experience simultaneous exposure to many of these chemicals. Average levels of daily exposure are below the levels deemed to be unsafe, but more research needs to be done on the effects of low dose exposure on humans. A lot is unknown on how severely humans are physically affected by these chemicals. Some of the chemicals used in plastic production can cause dermatitis upon contact with human skin. In many plastics, these toxic chemicals are only used in trace amounts, but significant testing is often required to ensure that the toxic elements are contained within the plastic by inert material or polymer.\n\nIt can also affect humans in which it may create an eyesore that interferes with enjoyment of the natural environment.\n\nDue to the pervasiveness of plastic products, most of the human population is constantly exposed to the chemical components of plastics. 95% of adults in the United States have had detectable levels of BPA in their urine. Exposure to chemicals such as BPA have been correlated with disruptions in fertility, reproduction, sexual maturation, and other health effects. Specific phthalates have also resulted in similar biological effects.\n\nBisphenol A affects gene expression related to the thyroid hormone axis, which affects biological functions such as metabolism and development. BPA can decrease thyroid hormone receptor (TR) activity by increasing TR transcriptional corepressor activity. This then decreases the level of thyroid hormone binding proteins that bind to triiodothyronine. By affecting the thyroid hormone axis, BPA expoure can lead to hypothyroidism.\n\nBPA can disrupt normal, physiological levels of sex hormones. It does this by binding to globulins that normally bind to sex hormones such as androgens and estrogens, leading to the disruption of the balance between the two. BPA can also affect the metabolism or the catabolism of sex hormones. It often acts as an antiandrogen or as an estrogen, which can cause disruptions in gonadal development and sperm production.\n\nEfforts to reduce the use of plastics and to promote plastic recycling have occurred. Some supermarkets charge their customers for plastic bags, and in some places more efficient reusable or biodegradable materials are being used in place of plastics. Some communities and businesses have put a ban on some commonly used plastic items, such as bottled water and plastic bags.\n\nThe use of biodegradable plastics has many advantages and disadvantages. Biodegradables are biopolymers that degrade in industrial composters. Biodegradables do not degrade as efficiently in domestic composters, and during this slower process, methane gas may be emitted.\n\nThere are also other types of degradable materials that are not considered to be biopolymers, because they are oil-based, similar to other conventional plastics. These plastics are made to be more degradable through the use of different additives, which help them degrade when exposed to UV rays or other physical stressors. yet, biodegradation-promoting additives for polymers have been shown not to significantly increase biodegradation.\n\nAlthough biodegradable and degradable plastics have helped reduce plastic pollution, there are some drawbacks. One issue concerning both types of plastics is that they do not break down very efficiently in natural environments. There, degradable plastics that are oil-based may break down into smaller fractions, at which point they do not degrade further.\n\nUp to 60% of used plastic medical equipment is incinerated rather than deposited in a landfill as a precautionary measure to lessen the transmission of disease. This has allowed for a large decrease in the amount of plastic waste that stems from medical equipment. If plastic waste is not incinerated and disposed of properly, a harmful amount of toxins can be released and dispersed as a gas through air or as ash through air and waterways. Many studies have been done concerning the gaseous emissions that result from the incineration process.\n\nAgencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration often do not assess the safety of new chemicals until after a negative side effect is shown. Once they suspect a chemical may be toxic, it is studied to determine the human reference dose, which is determined to be the lowest observable adverse effect level. During these studies, a high dose is tested to see if it causes any adverse health effects, and if it does not, lower doses are considered to be safe as well. This does not take into account the fact that with some chemicals found in plastics, such as BPA; lower doses can have a discernible effect. Even with this often complex evaluation process, policies have been put into place in order to help alleviate plastic pollution and its effects. Government regulations have been implemented that ban some chemicals from being used in specific plastic products.\n\nIn Canada, the United States, and the European Union, BPA has been banned from being incorporated in the production of baby bottles and children's cups, due to health concerns and the higher vulnerability of younger children to the effects of BPA. Taxes have been established in order to discourage specific ways of managing plastic waste. The landfill tax, for example, creates an incentive to choose to recycle plastics rather than contain them in landfills, by making the latter more expensive. There has also been a standardization of the types of plastics that can be considered compostable. The European Norm EN 13432, which was set by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), lists the standards that plastics must meet, in terms of compostability and biodegradability, in order to officially be labeled as compostable.\n\nThe Canadian federal government formed a current institution that protects marine areas; this includes the mitigation of plastic pollution. In 1997, Canada adopted legislation for oceans management and passed the Oceans Act. Federal governance, Regional Governance, and Aboriginal Peoples are the actors involved in the process of decision-making and implementation of the decision. The Regional Governance bodies are federal, provincial, and territorial government agencies that hold responsibilities of the marine environment. Aboriginal Peoples in Canada have treaty and non-treaty rights related to ocean activities. According to the Canadian government, they respect these rights and work with Aboriginal groups in oceans management activities.\n\nWith the Oceans Act made legal, Canada made a commitment to conserve and protect the oceans. The Ocean Acts' underlying principle is sustainable development, precautionary and integrated management approach to ensure that there is a comprehensive understanding in protecting marine areas. In the integrated management approach, the Oceans Act designates federal responsibility to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Canada for any new and emerging ocean-related activities. The Act encourages collaboration and coordination within the government that unifies interested parties. Moreover, the Oceans Act engages any Canadians who are interested in being informed of the decision-making regarding ocean environment.\n\nIn 2005, federal organizations developed the Federal Marine Protected Areas Strategy. This strategy is a collaborative approach implemented by Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Parks Canada, and Environment Canada to plan and manage federal marine protected areas. The federal marine protected areas work with Aboriginal groups, industries, academia, environmental groups, and NGOs to strengthen marine protected areas. The federal marine protected areas network consists of three core programs: Marine Protected Areas, Marine Wildlife Areas, and National Marine Conservation Areas. The MPA is a program to be noted because it is significant in protecting ecosystems from the effects of industrial activities. The MPA guiding principles are Integrated Management, ecosystem-based management approach, Adaptive Management Approach, Precautionary Principle, and Flexible Management Approach. All five guiding principles are used collectively and simultaneously to collaborate and respect legislative mandates of individual departments, to use scientific knowledge and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) to manage human activities, to monitor and report on programs to meet conservation objectives of MPAs, to use best available information in the absence of scientific certainty, and to maintain a balance between conservation needs and sustainable development objectives.\n\nThe two common forms of waste collection include curbside collection and the use of drop-off recycling centers. About 87 percent of the population in the United States (273 million people) have access to curbside and drop-off recycling centers. In curbside collection, which is available to about 63 percent of the United States population (193 million people), people place designated plastics in a special bin to be picked up by a public or private hauling company. Most curbside programs collect more than one type of plastic resin; usually both PETE and HDPE. At drop-off recycling centers, which are available to 68 percent of the United States population (213 million people), people take their recyclables to a centrally located facility. Once collected, the plastics are delivered to a materials recovery facility (MRF) or handler for sorting into single-resin streams to increase product value. The sorted plastics are then baled to reduce shipping costs to reclaimers.\n\nThere are varying rates of recycling per type of plastic, and in 2011, the overall plastic recycling rate was approximately 8% in the United States. Approximately 2.7 million tons of plastics were recycled in the U.S. in 2011. Some plastics are recycled more than others; in 2011 \"29 percent of HDPE bottles and 29 percent of PET bottles and jars were recycled.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India, has requested various governmental departments to avoid the use of plastic bottles to provide drinking water during governmental meetings, etc., and to instead make arrangements for providing drinking water that do not generate plastic waste. The state of Sikkim has restricted the usage of plastic water bottles (in government functions and meetings) and styrofoam products. The state of Bihar has banned the usage of plastic water bottles in governmental meetings.\n\nThe 2015 National Games of India, organised in Thiruvananthapuram, was associated with green protocols. This was initiated by Suchitwa Mission that aimed for \"zero-waste\" venues. To make the event \"disposable-free\", there was ban on the usage of disposable water bottles. The event witnessed the usage of reusable tableware and stainless steel tumblers. Athletes were provided with refillable steel flasks. It is estimated that these green practices stopped the generation of 120 metric tonnes of disposable waste.\n\nIn July 2018, Albania became the first country in Europe to ban lightweight plastic bags. Albania’s environment minister Blendi Klosi said that businesses importing, producing or trading plastic bags less than 35 microns in thickness risk facing fines between 1 million to 1.5 million lek (€7,900 to €11,800).\n\nOn 11 April 2013 in order to create awareness, artist Maria Cristina Finucci founded The Garbage Patch State at UNESCO –Paris in front of Director General Irina Bokova. First of a series of events under the patronage of UNESCO and of Italian Ministry of the Environment.\nInternational organisations have also been raising awareness of plastic pollution.\n\nEvery year, June 5 is observed as World Environment Day to raise awareness and increase government action on the pressing issue. In 2018, India is the host to this year’s World Environment Day and the theme is ‘Beat Plastic Pollution' with focus on single-use or disposable plastic. The Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of India invited people to take care of their Green Social Responsibility and urged them to take up Green Good Deeds in everyday life.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23640060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23640060", "title": "Polish decrees", "text": "Polish decrees\n\nPolish decrees, Polish directives or decrees on Poles () were the decrees of the Nazi Germany government announced on 8 March 1940 during World War II to regulate the working and living conditions of the Polish workers (\"Zivilarbeiter\") used during World War II as forced laborers in Germany. The regulation intentionally supported and even created anti-Polish racism and discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity and racial background.\n\nThe decrees were an important step towards codifying Nazi Germany policies and laws on foreign forced labor. They were meant to provide a legal basis for discriminating against Poles, fulfilling at the same time Nazi ideology and the needs of the Nazi economy. The racist notion of the inferiority of the forced laborers and prisoners of war from Poland when compared with the German master race was a prominent feature of the orders. The decrees, which recommended that examples of severe punishment be demonstrated to workers early on, were also aiming at clearly distinguishing the new conditions from pre-war voluntary seasonal labor.\n\nPolish workers were required to wear a clearly visible letter \"P\" badge, in addition to a work permit with a photo. The letter \"P\" badge was to be to worn on the right breast of every garment worn. Those who did not obey the rules were subject to a fine of up to 150 RM [Reichsmarks] and arrested with a possible penalty of six weeks detention. They should also be kept away from German \"cultural life\" and \"places of amusement\" (this included churches and restaurants). Sexual relations between Poles and Germans was prohibited as \"Rassenschande\" (race defilement), and so it was recommended that the same numbers of Polish males and females should be recruited, or that brothels should be set up. To keep them segregated from the German population, they were often housed in segregated barracks behind barbed wire. Mobility of workers, housed as far away as possible from Germans, was to be restricted, hence they were barred from using public transportation. They were also affected by after dark curfew. Wages paid to Polish workers were to be lower than those paid to the German workers, even through they had to work longer hours. Polish workers were also to receive substandard nutrition. They were not allowed certain types of possessions (bicycles, cameras). They often were denied holidays and had to work seven days a week. They could not enter a marriage without permission. Births were discouraged, and children were sometimes taken away from their families (see kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany).\n\nPunishments for disobedience for Polish workers included being sent to a concentration camp and the death penalty. Germans who disobeyed those laws by helping or sympathizing with the workers were to be punished as well, in extreme cases, by being sent to concentration camps.\n\nAfter the invasion of Poland, Poles over the age of 14 living in the General Government were subject to compulsory labor. In 1939 there were about 300,000 prisoners from Poland working in Germany; Already in 1944 there were about 2,8 m Polish \"Zivilarbeiters\" in Germany (approximately 10% of Generalgouvernement workforce) and a similar number of workers in this category from other countries.\nForced laborers worked in agriculture, but also manufacturing.\n\nWhere voluntary recruitment failed to yield a required number of workers, penalties were issued on communities that failed to provide workers (confiscation of property, fines); later, manhunts were organized (see łapanka).\n\nWorkers' lives were almost totally regimented.\n\nIn December 1941 the decrees were supplemented by Polish Criminal Regulation (\"Polenstrafrechtsverordnung\"), which introduced shortened trials for Poles in criminal cases. In February 1942 Eastern decrees (\"Ostarbeitererlasse\") were issued concerning the OST-Arbeiter (workers from territories taken from Soviet Union); based on the Polish decrees.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58083832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58083832", "title": "Pope Francis and homosexuality", "text": "Pope Francis and homosexuality\n\nPope Francis, elected in 2013, has repeatedly spoken about the need for the Catholic Church to welcome and love all people regardless of sexual orientation. Speaking about gay people in 2013, he said, \"the key is for the church to welcome, not exclude and show mercy, not condemnation.\" He said, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" \"The problem,\" he continued, \"is not having this orientation. We must be brothers.\" The pope has reiterated the Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality, including its position on marriage. He has also been outspoken on the need to be compassionate towards LGBT people, and was named the Person of the Year by the LGBT magazine \"The Advocate\".\n\nBefore he became pope and while serving as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio reportedly privately urged his fellow Argentine bishops in 2010 to signal the Church's public support for civil unions, as a compromise response to calls for same-sex marriage. Fellow bishops rejected the idea. Other sources both support and deny this account. At that time Argentina already permitted civil unions, and was debating a bill to allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children.\n\nPublicly, Bergoglio strongly opposed the bill, warning it could lead to a situation that could \"seriously harm the family\" and deprive children of the developmental supports of both their father and mother. After \"L'Osservatore Romano\" reported this, several priests expressed their support for the law and one was defrocked. Observers believe that the church's opposition and Bergoglio's language worked in favor of the law's passage and that in response, Catholic officials adopted a more conciliatory tone in later debates on social issues such as parental surrogacy.\n\nIn a 2010 book written with Rabbi Abraham Skorka, Bergoglio also spoke of same-sex marriage as \"a weakening of the institution of marriage, an institution that has existed for thousands of years and is 'forged according to nature and anthropology.'\"\n\nAs pope, Francis has repeatedly spoken about the need for the church to welcome and love all people, regardless of their sexual orientation. Speaking about gay people in 2013, he said that \"the key is for the church to welcome, not exclude and show mercy, not condemnation.\" In July of that year, he said \"If someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him? The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying…: 'no one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society.'\"\n\nSeveral LGBT groups welcomed the comments, noting that this was the first time a pope had used the word \"gay\" in public, and had also accepted the existence of gay people as a recognizable part of the Catholic Church community. In October 2016, Francis said that \"When a person (who is gay) arrives before Jesus, Jesus certainly will not say, 'Go away because you are homosexual.'\"\n\nAccording to two gay rights activists, Marcelo Márquez and Andrés Albertsen, Bergoglio expressed support for the spiritual needs of \"homosexual people\" and willingness to support \"measured actions\" on their behalf in private conversations with them.\n\nIn April 2018 Pope Francis met with Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of sexual abuse by Chilean priest Fernando Karadima. Cruz discussed with Francis in detail how his sexual orientation was used by Latin American media and news outlets to discredit his report of abuse and label him as a pervert and liar. In a private conversation between the two Francis reportedly said to Cruz, who identifies as homosexual, in regards to his sexuality, \"You know Juan Carlos, that does not matter. God made you like this. God loves you like this. The Pope loves you like this and you should love yourself and not worry about what people say.\"\n\nThese remarks have been seen as an encouraging change of tone from the papacy, so much so that the American LGBT magazine \"The Advocate\" named Pope Francis their Person of the Year for 2013.\n\nOn 26 August 2018 Pope Francis said in Ireland, that homosexual peope exist in whole history of human mankind. He teaches catholic parents to talk with their homosexual children and that they are part of their families and shouldn't \"thrown out\" of family. On 27 August 2018 Pope Francis press statement declares, that homosexuality is not an illness.\n\nFrancis has also spoken of the importance of education in the context of the difficulties now facing children, indicating that the Church had a challenge in not being welcoming enough of children brought up in a multiplicity of household arrangements, specifically including the children of gay couples. He mentioned as an example a case of a child with a mother living in a lesbian relationship: \n\"I remember the case of a very sad little girl who finally confided to her teacher the reason for her state of mind: 'my mother's fiancée doesn't like me'... How can we proclaim Christ to these boys and girls? How can we proclaim Christ to a generation that is changing? We must be careful not to administer a vaccine against faith to them.\"\n\nAfter Italian tabloids suggested his comments indicated a shift towards accepting civil unions for gay couples, the Director of the Holy See Press Office said the pope was talking only about the difficulties of children in non-traditional fmailies, not making a declaration on the debate in Italy concerning gay unions.\n\nFrancis has taught that \"Marriage is between a man and a woman. Secular states want to justify civil unions to regulate different situations of cohabitation, pushed by the demand to regulate economic aspects between persons, such as ensuring health care. It is about pacts of cohabitating of various natures, of which I wouldn't know how to list the different ways. One needs to see the different cases and evaluate them in their variety.\" Some interpreted this as suggesting that the Catholic Church could tolerate some types of non-marital civil unions, but the Vatican later clarified that was not Francis' intention.\n\nIn February 2015, Francis encouraged people in Slovakia, who were considering limiting marriage to opposite sex couples, to \"continue their efforts in defense of the family, the vital cell of society.\" At the start of 2014, Bishop Charles J. Scicluna of Malta reported that in a private conversation held with Pope Francis in December 2013, the pope said that gay marriage was \"an anthropological regression.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" considers that Bergoglio may have supported gay unions in Argentina only as a negotiated compromise, but that his context as a Pope is very different. In 2015, Pope Francis declared that \"the family is threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage\" and suggested that same-sex marriage \"disfigures God's plan for creation.\"\n\nFrancis presided over the 2014 Synod on the Family, the first assembly of the Synod to explicitly examine the issue of pastoral care for people in same-sex civil unions and marriages. The synod's working document called for less judgment towards people that are gay and more understanding towards same-sex couples in civil unions or marriages, as well as an equal welcome for children of such couples (including conferring baptism), while still rejecting the validity of same-sex marriage itself. However, the final report failed to contain the proposed language as it did not receive the necessary two-thirds support of attending bishops.'\n\nIn the post-synodal apostolic exhortation \"Amoris Laetitia\", issued in 2016, Francis encouraged better understanding from all members of the church on the acceptance of gay people, without suggesting any specific doctrinal changes. Instead, he reiterated the need for every person to be respected regardless of their sexual orientation, and to be free from threats of aggression and violence. He avoided any recognition of unions between same sex couples, but rather maintained that these were not equal to heterosexual unions. Some parts of the media interpreted his remarks as more moderate on the issue of homosexuality than that taken by church leaders in previous years.\n\nOn 2 October 2016, Pope Francis spoke in favor of pastoral care for and including transgender Catholics in the church, stating priests should \"accompany them spiritually\" and that they should never be turned away, even if they have undergone gender transition and sex-reassignment operations. He spoke out against \"Gender Theory\"—the idea that gender identity is not definite and can change—being taught in schools. He referred to it as \"ideological colonization\" and said it was a threat to traditional marriage and is destructive to children. New Ways Ministry and DignityUSA, two dissenting LGBT Catholic advocacy groups, both spoke out against Pope Francis's statements regarding gender identity, calling it \"dangerous ignorance\" of the issue.\n\nFrancis once held an audience with a Spanish transgender man, who had transitioned from female to male, and his wife.\n\nDuring his 2015 visit to the United States, Francis held a private meeting with Kim Davis, a county clerk from Kentucky who had gained international attention after defying a federal court order requiring that she issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The Vatican press office shortly after issued a statement saying that the pope was unaware of her situation and the meeting was not to be considered an endorsement.

He was reported to have promised to see what could be done to address the issue. In October 2015, priest and Vatican theologian Priest Krzysztof Charamsa was stripped of his posts after announcing he was in a homosexual relationship.\n\nIn relation to reports that a Vatican official whom he had recently promoted had had a homosexual relationship, the pope drew a distinction between sins, which can be forgiven if repented of, and crimes, such as sexual abuse of minors.\n"}

The first permanent Portuguese communities in the region were established in the 16th century. The whole region was divided into \"prazos\" (agricultural estates), to be lived by Portuguese settler families in the 17th century. Mozambique was declared a Portuguese province by the 19th century. By the early 20th century, the mainland government permitted more white emigration and settlement to the region, and Mozambique had 370,000 Portuguese settlers, who improved its economy, by the 1960s. It was during this time that António de Oliveira Salazar led Portugal, in which several thousands of Portuguese citizens fled to other countries, especially neighbouring Rhodesia and South Africa as well as Brazil and the United States. Blacks and some \"mestiços\" and whites revolted against Portuguese rule in 1974. \n\nThe return to liberal democracy in Portugal led to the independence of its overseas colonies in 1975. By July 1975 around 80,000 Portuguese Mozambicans were left in the country from around 250,000 that lived in the country in the early 1970s. Of the 80,000 only around 10,000 opted for Mozambican citizenship instead of Portuguese citizenship. The most decisive factors for the preference for white emigration according to US diplomat William Jacobsen was a \"combination of doctors leaving for good, plummeting standards of medical care... and uncertainty about country's willingness to allow Mozambican citizens to leave national territory.\"\n\nLarge numbers of Portuguese residents emigrated shortly after, most of them to Portugal, where they were called \"retornados\", while others moved to neighbouring Malawi, Rhodesia, or South Africa, and/or Brazil and the United States. Most notable legacy of Portuguese Mozambican settlers in South Africa is Nando's, created in 1987, which incorporated influences from former Portuguese settlers from Mozambique, many of whom had settled on the south-eastern side of Johannesburg, after Mozambique's independence in 1975. \n\nWhen the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was founded in 1996, many Portuguese and Portuguese Brazilians arrived for economic and educational aid to Mozambique. They have helped increase Portuguese-language fluency especially in remote rural places and improved the economy, as the metical has a large value converted from the Euro. Many among them have adopted the country as their permanent home. Many more Portuguese settlers returned from Portugal, it is estimated by the Mozambican embassy that about 6,000 returned.\n\nPortuguese is the official language and lingua franca of Mozambique. Their dialect called Mozambican Portuguese is closer to Standard European Portuguese than Brazilian dialects. Among them speak one of main Bantu languages (like Xitsonga, Makhuwa, and Ndau dialect of Shona) as second languages. Many educated Portuguese Mozambicans speak English, as it is an international lingua franca and Mozambique is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nMost Portuguese Mozambicans are Christians belonging to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Razzaq Gul was a member of the Baloch National Movement and secretary of the Press Club of Turbat.\n\nRazzaq Gul was the 22nd journalist to have been murdered in the area of Balochistan, listed as one of the most dangerous places for reporters in Pakistan, over a four-year period, and he was one of eight Pakistani journalists killed since Jan 2011. Three days of demonstrations after his death began 1 June 2012 to protest his murder and impunity, the killing of journalists without investigation or prosecution.\n\nRazzaq Gul, 35, native of Pakistan, was taken against his will and executed while working as a journalist in Turbat, Pakistan. After being identified by his brother, Gul was buried in his hometown of Singhania Sir.\n\nRazzaq Gul was a television journalist covering war and politics for at least 10 years for Express News in the Balochistan province in Turbat, Pakistan. Gul was the secretary of the Press Club located in Turbat and he was a member of the nationalist political organisation, Baloch National Movement\n\nRazzaq Gul was taken after leaving a press club on his way home on 18 May 2012. His body was found the next morning, 19 May 2012, with at least 15 bullet holes and evidence of torture. The unknown assailants discarded the body close to the Old Civil Hospital located in Turbat.\n\nThe city of Turbat, where Gul was found murdered, is located in the province of Balochistan, where intense manoeuvres have been carried out by the Pakistani Military from 2001. The military wants to build temporary quarters for troops in the area which has been met by strong opposition from the citizens of the province due to the growing number of innocent people being killed. The Pakistan Air Force has bombed many of the districts in the region allegedly killing over 3000 people. Over 200,000 people have been forced to relocate to shelters due to the bombings.\n\nDue to the violence in the Balochistan province, many reporters are scared to speak out. Razzaq Gul continued to report the facts even though journalists were being persecuted in his home country. Journalists are being targeted and murdered as a way to keep them from reporting the truth about the violent situation in this area of Pakistan. Research has placed Pakistan at the top of the list for countries posing the most danger to journalists\n. Since 2008, there have been at least 27 reporters and news personnel executed in Pakistan.\n\nReaction to Razzaq Gul's murder was strong and swift. Owais Aslam Ali, secretary general of Pakistan Press International, said journalists in Balochistan need protection to make it possible for them to report the facts as it has become almost impossible for them to do their jobs. Balochistan Union of Journalists called for a mourning period of three days which began 1 June 2012 Demonstrations took place in Turbat and surrounding areas with shops closing and protestors marching as they chanted for Gul's murderers to be brought to justice. The protesters said they did not want Razzaq Gul or any other innocent civilian or media worker to be just another name on a list of the dead that goes unsolved.\n\nIrina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \"I condemn the killings of Abdul Razaq Gul and Aurengzeb Tunio who died alongside two companions. I urge the authorities to investigate these killings. It is essential for freedom of expression and for good governance that those responsible for the death of journalists be brought to justice.\" Other human rights groups called on Pakistani authorities to thoroughly investigate Gul's killing and bring the unknown assailants to justice, and the Acting Inspector General of Police Hussain Karar Khwaja initiated an investigation.\n\nList of journalists killed during the Balochistan conflict (1947-Present)\n"}

It has not proven possible to analyse the dye itself from the stains that remain.\n\nThe motifs are carefully executed and the most common are dots and wavy lines. Other motifs are small circles, pentacles, crescents and triangles, showing strong relationships with the Pictish symbol stone motifs.\n\nExperimental archaeology suggests that the designs were likely to have been painted with peat tar.\n\nTo date, 55 painted pebbles have been found. 11 of these were found in Caithness, 5 in Orkney, 27 in Shetland. Most have come from broch sites which have been shown to have had an extensive post-broch occupation. An ogham-inscribed spindle-whorl was associated with one find at Buckquoy in Orkney (see Buckquoy spindle whorl). Several have been associate with wheelhouses or their outbuildings. An example was found at a Pictish site at Buckquoy in Orkney as reported in 1976. It had the \"small ring\" type decoration.\n\nScottish Painted pebbles have been dated to the period 200 AD to the eighth century AD, the Pictish period. They may have been sling-stones that were thought to be of magical nature by the Picts, however local traditions suggest that they were 'charm-stones', often known as 'Cold-stones'. Such stones were used within living memory to cure sickness in animals and humans.\n\nIn the \"Life of St. Columba\" it is recorded that he visited King Bridei in Pictland in around the year 565 AD and taking a white stone pebble from the River Ness he blessed it and any water it came into contact with would cure sick people. It floated in water and cured the king from a terminal illness. It remained as one of the great treasures of the king and cured many others.\n\n\n"}

Measuring up to 335 x 485 cm, they are generally attributed to Central Asia and bear the strong influence of Chinese art and techniques, as well as symbols of Buddhism and Shamanism, which were both major faiths in the region of Central Asia before the arrival of Islam.\n\nIn tone and theme, the images are a highpoint of Persian draughtsmanship and include works from the Mozaffarid, Jalāyerid and Turkmen periods. They are sometimes attributed to the notname Muhammad Siyah Qalam; equivalent in English to the \"Master of the Black Pen\".\n\nThe figures span a variety of cultures: Iranian, Turkic, Chinese, Mongolian, and Indian, and date to the century after reign of the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur. Notable for their intrinsic quality, they contain depictions of diabolic imagery, everyday nomadic life in the Euroasian steppe, and contemporary culture's relationship with the dead.\n\nThey are held at the Topkapi Saray Library, Istanbul; parts of the larger \"Diez Albums\" of the Berlin State Library are closely related.\nThe more fantastical and intensely coloured images seem to conjure the devastation and bleakness of Genghis Khan's reign. The drawings have been described as evidencing the \"brutal realism of the draftsmanship [while] the lyricism of the refined delineations is of such intensity that it has been matched only in isolated instances in Buddhist as well as Islamic paintings\". In general the inscribed text is banal and not of comparable quality to the illustrations, either in craft or meaning.\nThe compositions are highly expressive, and a number of figures are engaged in ecstatic ritual or dance. The fantastical monsters are drawn from local Pre-Islamic Central Asian folklore, bearing resemblance to beings of Indian, Chinese and middle Eastern legend as Central Asia lies on the cultural crossroad between the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia. Many of the earthly scenes depict everyday life in the Central Asian Steppes as lived by various ethnic people, most prominent the Turkic and Iranian; washing clothes, blowing fire on a cooker, hanging lines of bows and arrows. The living wear various head-dress and costumes and carry a variety of tools and weapons, and engage in different rituals.\n\nThe miniatures bear the heavy influence of Chinese art, subtly in their sinuous lines and fluid rhythms, overtly in the figure's dress in that country's traditional dress. The works are of historical interest because of their depictions of everyday life of the faded world of historic Central Asia; with descriptions of tools, costumes, rituals, headdress, and the treatment of domesticated animals.\n\nThe cultic acts, especially the ecstatic movement of the dancing figures, filled with emotion and vehement gestures, according to art historian Ingto Walther show \"twisted limb and windining motifs...[and are contrasted by the]...brutal realism that overlies the virtuosity of draftsmanship, the lyricism of the refined delineation is of such intensity that it has been matched in isolated subsequent instances in Buddhist as well as Islamic painting\".\n\nThe sources for the drawings are uncertain; various parts may be influenced by the Shahnameh and the biblical Solomon. In addition, given their often disparate size; their precise function cannot be determined with much certainty, though it might be that they were intended as aids to storytelling, to Royal elites. \nThe extant leaves are taken from a number of scrolls that transferred ownership during wars and land occupations. Leaves are recorded in inventories in Istanbul and in the library of Topkapi palace of Sultan Selim I as booty from his 1514 Persian adventure.\n\n"}
{"id": "12009633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12009633", "title": "Sociophysiology", "text": "Sociophysiology\n\nSociophysiology is the \"interplay between society and physical functioning\" (Freund 1988: 856) involving \"collaboration of two neighboring sciences: physiology and sociology\" (Mauss 1936: 373). In other words, sociophysiology is physiological sociology, a special science that studies the physiological side of human (and other animals') interrelations (Zeliony 1912: 405–406).\n\nIn addition to having been termed an \"interdisciplinary area for research, an area which demonstrates the concomitant relationship between physiology and social behavior\" (Di Mascio et al. 1955: 4), sociophysiology may also be described as \"social ethology\" and \"social energetics\" (Waxweiler 1906: 62). That is, the \"physiology of reactive phenomena caused by the mutual excitations of individuals of the same species\" (Waxweiler 1906: 62).\n\nThe interdisciplinary nature of sociophysiology largely entails a \"synthesis of psychophysiology and social interaction\" (Adler 2002: 884) such that a \"socio-psycho-biological study\" (Mauss 1936: 386) of \"biologico-sociological phenomena\" (Mauss 1936: 385) may ensue. Such \"socio-psycho-biological study\" has uncovered a \"sharing of physiology between people involved in a meaningful interaction\" (Adler 2002: 884), as well as \"mutually responsive physiologic engagement having normative function in maintaining social cohesion and well-being in higher social animals\" (Adler 2002: 885). This \"mutually responsive physiologic engagement\" brings into play the \"close links uniting social phenomena to the biological phenomena from which they immediately derive\" (Solvay 1906: 26).\n\nFurthermore, sociophysiology explores the \"intimate relationship and mutual regulation between social and physiological systems that is especially vital in human groups\" (Barchas 1986: 210). In other words, sociophysiology studies the \"physio- and psycho-energetic phenomena at the basis of social groupings\" (Solvay 1906: 25). Along these lines, Zeliony (1912) noted that\n\nIn addition, sociophysiology \"describes structure-function relationships for body structures and interactive functions relevant to psychiatric illness\" (Gardner 1997: 351), and also \"assumes that psychiatric disorders are pathological variants of the motivation, emotions, and conflict involved in normal communicational processes\" (Gardner and Price 1999: 247–248). Psychiatry, thus, involves the diagnosis and treatment of what Lilienfeld (1879: 280) termed \"physiological social pathology\", and may be classed as a subfield of sociophysiology, called \"pathological sociophysiology\" by Zeliony (1912: 405). As summarized by Ellwood (1916), Zeliony thought that, in the future,\n\nEllwood (1916: 298) also noted that Zeliony's future sociophysiology, being a natural biological science, must be Darwinian.\n\nIn short, sociophysiology is \"reciprocal, interpersonal physiology\" (Adler 2002: 885). Such interpersonal physiology may have implications in the realm of human politics. For example, the findings of a recent study \"suggest that political attitudes vary with physiological traits linked to divergent manners of experiencing and processing environmental threats\" (Oxley et al. 2008: 1669).\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was from Phetchabun's Lom Sak district in Thailand and had lived in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, Japan, where she was forced into prostitution. She was incarcerated for several years in a Japanese prison until she was released in September 2005 due to the development of a terminal form of ovarian cancer. She was allowed to return to her hometown in Thailand to spend her final days with her family. Upon her return, Soimee filed a civil lawsuit against her traffickers in Thailand, reported to be the first suit of its kind in the country. However, she died in May 2006 before the case was adjudicated. Her adoptive mother has said that she will continue her case in court.\n\nUrairat Soimee was born in the Lom Sak district of Phetchabun, Thailand. She had three children and a husband, who became disabled due to a car accident. Like many women in her village, she was poor and had little formal education. She went by the nickname \"Bua\", which means \"lotus flower\" in Thai. She was recruited to work in Japan by a wealthy neighbor, Patama Kosaka, an alleged childhood friend of Soimee's mother. Kosaka claimed she was married to a Japanese man and that she owned a Thai restaurant in Japan where she wanted Soimee to work as a waitress. The girl had no radio or television and little formal education, and therefore was not aware of the many cases in which women from Thailand were tricked or coerced into prostitution abroad. \n\nSoimee arrived in Japan in 2000 and was transported to Yokkaichi by a Thai woman named Dao and her husband, where she was told that she would have to work as a prostitute. When she protested, she was told that if she did not comply, she would be sold to a brothel on an island and thrown into the sea if she tried to escape. Soimee was told that she could leave after paying off her debt within five months. During this time, she was locked in the apartment with other Thai sex slaves, and taken out by Dao and her husband to hotel rooms to service customers, ranging from three to six a day. Soimee was forced to service customers even when menstruating, and after having contracted a painful sexually transmitted disease. \n\nHowever, at the end of five months, Dao refused to release her, saying that she had been sold to another yakuza gang and that her debt had increased. It was at that point that Soimee reportedly contacted another Thai sex slave, Pranee, and a Thai friend, Boon, to help her escape. \n\nThe circumstances surrounding Dao's death and Urairat's escape are disputed. In an interview with the \"Bangkok Post\", Soimee claimed that Boon, her friend, came to the apartment and helped her escape, and that Boon eventually killed Dao to prevent her from going to the yakuza. However, the Kyodo news service reported that Japanese prosecutors accused Soimee of robbery and murder by smashing Dao's head with a bottle.\n\nDespite pleas from human rights organizations, Boon was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the murder, and Soimee was sentenced for seven years. While in prison, Soimee was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer and released from custody to spend her remaining days with her family in Thailand.\n\nPatama and her parents, the three traffickers who deceived Soimee and Pranee into coming to Japan, were sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in criminal court. Soimee filed a 4.6 million baht civil lawsuit against the three, reported to be the first of its kind in Thailand. However, she died in May 2006 before her case was adjudicated.\n\nHer adoptive mother, Lamyai Kaewkerd, vowed to continue her battle in court. Upon her return to Thailand, Soimee became a strong voice against human trafficking, leading a campaign that urged other victims to step forward. She earned an award from Thailand's Social Development and Human Security Ministry in March 2006 to celebrate International Women's Day for her work in fighting human trafficking.\"My wish is for the government and all sides to get tough with human trafficking rackets, the same way it suppresses drugs\", she was quoted as saying. \"I want my last wish to be fulfilled. It is not only a gift for me, but also for women in general because they shouldn't live through a hellish experience like I have.\"\n\n"}

About this time, Robert De Niro's production company Tribeca expressed interest in a Queen musical, but it found the original idea difficult to work with.\n\nIn 2000, Ben Elton was approached to start talks with May and Taylor on the project. He suggested taking the musical down a different path than initially imagined, creating an original story that would capture the spirit of much of their music. He worked closely with May and Taylor to incorporate Queen's songs into the story. Elton has also stated that he was in part inspired by the computer-controlled dystopia of the science-fiction film \"The Matrix\". The script was eventually completed midway through 2001.\n\nLondon's critics almost uniformly panned the show, criticising the concept and direction. \"The Guardian\" wrote that the premise \"really is as sixth form as it sounds\", called the production \"ruthlessly packaged and manufactured\" and opined that the \"sometimes funny\" libretto exists mainly to \"devise more unlikely ways to wring out another Queen song.\" The \"Daily Mirror\" wrote that \"Ben Elton should be shot for this risible story.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" described it as \"guaranteed to bore you rigid\" and \"prolefeed at its worst.\" However, some individual performances received praise and the production remains a popular success.\n\nThe original production of \"We Will Rock You\" opened on 12 May 2002 at the Dominion Theatre, London, with previews beginning on 26 April. Tony Vincent played the lead role of Galileo, with Hannah Jane Fox as Scaramouche, Sharon D. Clarke as Killer Queen, Nigel Planer as Pop, Nigel Clauzel as Brit and Kerry Ellis as Meat. For her performance, Clarke was nominated for \"Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical or Entertainment\" at the 2003 Olivier Awards.\n\nOn 17 August 2005 \"We Will Rock You\" became the longest running musical at that venue, surpassing the previous record-holder \"Grease\". This is a notable achievement because the Dominion Theatre is one of the largest theatrical venues in West End, with a seating a capacity of 2,163 patrons. At the 2011 Laurence Olivier Awards, the show won the Audience Award for Most Popular Show.\n\nNotable cast replacements include Mig Ayesa, who played Galileo, taking over from Tony Vincent. Mazz Murray took over the role of Killer Queen after Sharon D. Clarke's departure in April 2004. Murray left the production in August 2011, which made her the longest running principal cast member, although she left the production briefly in September 2010 for maternity leave. Brenda Edwards, who was an \"X-Factor\" semi-finalist in 2005, is currently performing the role of Killer Queen. On 22 September 2008 \"I'd Do Anything\" semi-finalist, Rachel Tucker, began performing in the role of Meat. She left the production on 19 September 2009. The role was then taken on by Irish born performer Louise Bowden, who had already performed in several prolific musicals including \"Mamma Mia!\", \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"Mary Poppins\". Bowden unexpectedly quit the production in May 2010. It was then left to Amanda Coutts to perform the role Meat. Coutts was originally Bowden's understudy. The West End production featured a nine piece live band under the musical direction of Stuart Morley.\n\nA national UK tour was launched in 2009 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester. The 2009 tour cast initially included, Alex Gaumond as Galileo, Sarah French-Ellis as Scaramouche, Brenda Edwards as Killer Queen, Georgina Hagen as Meat, Jonathan Wilkes as Khashoggi, Kevin Kennedy as Pop. Gaumond and French-Ellis returned to play their characters in the West End and were Galileo and Scaramouche.\n\nA second UK tour launched in December 2010 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester.\n\nOn 11 March 2014 it was announced the West End production would close on 31 May 2014, shortly after its 12th Anniversary, and after 4600 performances at the Dominion Theatre.\n\nThe first international production premiered at the Regent Theatre in Melbourne, Australia on 7 August 2003. The cast included Michael Falzon as Galileo, Kate Hoolihan as Scaramouche and Annie Crummer as Killer Queen. Amanda Harrison, who originated Oz in this Melbourne production, had previously been in the ensemble of the original London production. The production closed at this venue on 4 March 2004 to make way for Australian tour stops at Burswood Theatre, Perth (27 April to June 2004), Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane (27 July to 25 September 2004), and Star City Lyric Theatre, Sydney (9 October 2004 to 13 March 2005). The same production then made an international tour stop at the Shinjuku Koma Theater in Tokyo, Japan where it ran from 27 May to 24 August 2005.\n\nDue to the success of the Japan tour stop, another Australian tour group was put together in 2006. They performed at the same venue: the Shinjuku Koma Theatre in Tokyo, from 14 November to 17 December 2006. Some of the actors of the 2005 tour returned for the 2006 tour, including Peter Murphy as Galileo, Daniel Fletcher as Brit, Ross Givern as Khashoggi and Robert Grubb as Pop. Kate Hoolihan, who had played Scaramouche in the 2005 tour, chose to switch to the role of Oz in the 2006 tour. The tour group then performed in Osaka from 5 January 2007 at the Umeda Arts Theater.\n\nA new tour of Australia was announced on 17 August 2015. The tour is commenced in Sydney, NSW on 30 April 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Platinum Entertainment Perth will present Western Australia's first PRO/AM production of We Will Rock You, commencing 23 March 2018 at His Majesty's Theatre, Perth.

Ryan Dawson joins the cast in the role of Khashoggi, following his stint in the role of Madonna in London's West End.\n\nIn November 2018, Canberra based production company Peewee Productions launched an elaborate PRO/AM stage production at the AIS arena, running for three nights. It was incredible.\n\nA Spanish production ran from 1 October 2003 (official opening on 3 November) to 30 May 2004 at Teatro Calderón, Madrid.

The rest of the cast included María Blanco as Scaramouche, Sheilah Cuffy as Killer Queen, Javier Navares as Khashoggi, Ángel Padilla as Brit, Eva María Cortés (sister of Momo Cortés) as Meat, and José María Guzmán and Juanjo Pardo sharing the role of Pop. The Madrid production had all spoken dialogue and the lyrics translated into Spanish, except for the songs \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", which retained their English lyrics. After closing at Teatro Calderón, the show began a tour through Spain with stops at Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia, and Seville.\n\nIn 2007 the production returned to Teatro Calderón, Madrid with previews from 23 January and an official opening on 12 February.

The production finally closed on 6 January 2008.\n\nA US tour had originally been planned for 2004, with initially announced stops in Connecticut and Washington state. However, due to scheduling conflicts of the creative team, the US tour was scrapped and replaced with a production housed at the Paris Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, which is the musical's first North American venue.\n\nThe Las Vegas production had previews from 4 August and officially opened on 8 September 2004. Tony Vincent, who had originated the role of Galileo in the London production, reprised the role, which he alternated with Jason Wooten. Aspen Miller and Kacie Sheik shared the role of Scaramouche, Patti Russo was Killer Queen, and Ty Taylor was Brit. The Las Vegas production \"trimmed\" down the book into a single act show. This production closed on 27 November 2005.\n\nOn 15 October 2013, a North American tour began at the Hippodrome Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland.

The production's dialogue and all songs but three were translated into Russian, by Evgeny Margulis of Mashina Vremeni. This production closed only four months after its opening due to disagreements between the show's producers, despite fan protests to keep the show going.\n\nA German production opened in the Musical Dome, Cologne on 12 December 2004. The Cologne production had the spoken dialogue translated to German, but the musical numbers consisted of a mix of translated German language lyrics and the original English language lyrics. According to Brian May, the language combination was intentional by writer Ben Elton, with German representing the show's \"present day\" and English representing the distant past. The production closed at this venue on 30 September 2008 to be transferred to Stuttgart. The Stuttgart transfer opened at the Apollo Theatre on 13 November 2008 after previews from 7 November 2008.\nThe production opened in Berlin on 21 October 2010 and closed for good on 21 October 2011.\n\nA follow up tour version started in December 2012 in Basel and closed in June 2013 in Essen.

Mig Ayesa, who played the lead role in the London production, had been offered the role in the Canadian production by Brian May and Ben Elton, but the Canadian producers wanted an all-Canadian cast and Quebec native Yvan Pednault was given the role. The rest of the cast included Erica Peck as Scaramouche, Alana Bridgewater as Killer Queen, Suzie McNeil as Oz and Evan Buliung as Khashoggi. McNeil had been a participant of the reality show \"\", in which she had competed against Ayesa and former Las Vegas \"We Will Rock You\" cast member Ty Taylor.\n\nThis production closed at the Canon Theatre on 11 May 2008 to be transferred to the Panasonic Theatre, where it opened on 16 July 2008. The new Toronto production underwent major rewrites in order to trim the show before its reopening. Changes include: there is no longer any dialogue between \"Ga-Ga\" and \"I Want to Break Free\"; \"One Vision\" has been cut; the Act Two song sequence is now \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", \"Hammer to Fall\" and then \"Another One Bites the Dust\" before leading to the finale.

Earth has been renamed as the \"iPlanet\" (Planet Mall in older and school productions) and is controlled by the Globalsoft Corporation. (\"Innuendo\")\nOn the iPlanet, mainstream commercial conformity reigns, in which Ga Ga Kids watch the same movies, listen to computer-generated music, wear the same clothes and hold the same thoughts and opinions. Musical instruments are forbidden, and rock music is unknown. (\"Radio Ga Ga\")\n\nIn the newest graduating class is black sheep, Galileo, who has dreams and hears strange words in his head, most of which are lyrics of songs long since lost, though he does not understand their significance. Despite his teacher's advice, Galileo refuses to conform like the rest of his classmates. (\"I Want to Break Free\") Galileo is captured by Khashoggi, commander of Globalsoft's police. The teacher also reveals a second anomaly, a young, goth woman named Scaramouche who is openly mocked and derided by her peers (\"Somebody to Love\"). She too is arrested by Khashoggi.\n\nRuling Globalsoft Corporation is Killer Queen. (\"Killer Queen\") She has heard of a prophecy that instruments have been hidden somewhere on the iPlanet in the \"place of living rock\", and a \"bright star\" will show the way to them. She orders Khashoggi to get to the bottom of the matter and crush the rebel Bohemians who believe in the prophecy. Killer Queen then basks in her power over the iPlanet. (\"Play the Game\" (in some productions \"Now I'm Here\"))\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche wake up in a hospital. They realise that they are kindred spirits, feared by the rest of their society. (\"Under Pressure\") They flee together from the hospital.\nKhashoggi has blown up all the rocks on the iPlanet, but cannot find any supposed hidden instruments. Killer queen insists that they have won, and the prophecy will not come to pass. (\"A Kind of Magic\")\n\nOn the streets, Bohemian couple Britney and Meat climb out of the sewers, where they have been gathering materials to make musical instruments. Britney is a believer in the Dreamer who will fulfil the prophecy, and insists to the cynical Meat that it's the key to bringing real music back into the world. (\"I Want It All\") Brit and Meat hear footsteps approaching, and hide.\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche arrive, with Galileo talking about his belief that he has a destiny. He says that he dreamt a name for the woman: \"Scaramouche\". Britney and Meat reveal themselves, and accuse Galileo and Scaramouche of being spies, because Galileo keeps spouting words of the \"sacred text\". Galileo insists that he only hears those words in his head. Britney tests Galileo, singing the first few lines of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Galileo responds correctly with the subsequent lines, and Britney realises that he is the Dreamer of the prophecy. They bring Galileo and Scaramouche to the Heartbreak Hotel, which is located at the ruins of the Tottenham Court Road tube station, where the Bohemians have made their home. (\"Headlong\") Of note, the original London production is staged at the Dominion Theatre, which is located above the real Tottenham Court Road tube station.\n\nThe Bohemians explain to Galileo that they take their names after singers long gone, and mourn the deaths of those who died young. (\"No One But You\") The group then celebrate the reason rock bands started playing music in the first place, which was for love. (\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\")\n\nKhashoggi and his police suddenly arrive at the Heartbreak Hotel, where they round up the Bohemians for capture. Britney breaks free and battles the police in order to enable Galileo and Scaramouche to escape, but in the process is killed.\n\nThe Ga Ga Kids of the iPlanet move on in their regular fashion. (\"One Vision\")\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche have escaped the Heartbreak Hotel, and realise that back at the hospital, tracking devices were installed in their heads. They remove them, and upon realising that they are all that's left of the rebels, they confess their love for each other. (\"Who Wants to Live Forever\")\n\nThe surviving Bohemians have been rounded up by Khashoggi to be tortured. (\"Flash\") When he cannot get any information from them about the prophecy, he has them brain-drained. (\"Seven Seas of Rhye\"—interpolating \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\")\n\nGalileo wakes up, and tells Scaramouche that he had a dream that the Bohemians were sent to the Seven Seas of Rhye. Scaramouche agrees they have to go there, but then Galileo insists that she stay because she's a \"chick\", to which Scaramouche takes offence. They argue, and decide that both of them will go to the Seven Seas of Rhye, but their relationship will be purely professional.\n\nBack at Globalsoft headquarters (\"Fat Bottomed Girls\") Khashoggi reports that the Bohemians are no longer a problem. Killer Queen prematurely starts to celebrate. (\"Don't Stop Me Now\") Khashoggi interrupts her, explaining that Galileo and Scaramouche escaped. Killer Queen declares this is the last time Khashoggi has disappointed her, and has him brain-drained. (\"Another One Bites the Dust\")\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche are making their way to the Seven Seas of Rhye, arguing all the way. (\"Hammer to Fall\") At the Seven Seas of Rhye pub in Montreaux, Pop the librarian is serving drinks to the lifeless Bohemians. (\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\") When Galileo and Scaramouche arrive, Pop explains the full nature of the prophecy to them as inscribed by the three remaining members of the band Queen just before they were sentenced to death (Brian May, his last request being a final guitar solo, apparently delayed his execution for three and a half days). Scaramouche figures out that the bright shining star of the prophecy is rock star Freddie Mercury's statue, and that it's pointing to Wembley Stadium, the \"place of living rock\". After initially preparing to travel by bicycle, (opening of \"Bicycle Race\") Scaramouche protests that the method \"isn't very cool\", and so they travel there by motorcycle. (\"Headlong (reprise)\")\n\nWembley Stadium is in ruins, with no instruments to be found. Reconciling and their love for each other rekindled (\"Love of My Life\"), Scaramouche inspires Galileo to perform the opening of \"We Will Rock You\", and an electric guitar is revealed. Galileo cannot play it, but Scaramouche can. (\"Brighton Rock solo\") Pop hacks into Globalsoft's network so their music can be heard by everyone on the iPlanet, and Killer Queen is defeated. (\"Tie Your Mother Down\", \"We Will Rock You / We Are the Champions\")\n\nAfter the curtain calls (\"We Will Rock You \"), the entire company performs \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as an encore.\n\nInternational productions of the musical feature changes in the story and song line-up in order to better reach target audiences. All the main characters retain their general personalities across productions, but the names vary depending on the production. (See characters section below).\n\nThe dialogue contains many references to popular culture, with lyrics from numerous non-Queen songs and albums inserted into the text. These references are constantly changing, and according to writer Elton, this is to keep the show \"fresh\". Songs that have been referenced include The Beatles' \"Help!\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Penny Lane\", \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", \"I Am the Walrus\" and \"Hello, Goodbye\", Little Richard's \"Tutti Fruitti\" and \"Long Tall Sally\", the theme from The Wombles, The Goodies' \"Funky Gibbon\", Bruce Springsteen's \"Born to Run\", David Bowie's \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Space Oddity\", The Wild Ones' \"Wild Thing\", Rolling Stones' \"Honky Tonk Women\", Bob Dylan's \"Mr. Tambourine Man\", ABBA's \"Dancing Queen\" and \"Fernando\", Oasis' \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\", Eminem's \"The Real Slim Shady\", Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\", Elton John's \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", Black Lace's \"Agadoo\", The Clash's \"Complete Control\", \"Teletubbies\" and songs by Amy Winehouse and Michael Jackson.\n\nMay often performs with the London production on special occasions such as anniversaries and Freddie Mercury's birthday.\n\nHannah Jane Fox, who originated Scaramouche, was the last original principal cast member to remain with the show. She gave her final performance on 28 January 2006, four years after the musical opened at the Dominion Theatre, and the event was celebrated with May appearing on stage to perform the guitar solo during the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" encore.\n\nOn 5 September 2006, the London show celebrated what would have been Freddie Mercury's 60th birthday. During the song \"Don't Stop Me Now\", ordinarily sung by Killer Queen, the band \"McFly\" (who were at No. 1 with the song on the singles charts the previous week) emerged onto the stage to sing it instead. Brian May and Roger Taylor joined the encore, performing Taylor's \"Say It's Not True\" as a duo. Ben Elton also addressed the audience on this special occasion. The following week, tickets to the London show were sold from £19.46, Mercury's birth year.\n\nOn 14 May 2007, the London show celebrated its fifth anniversary with a special show featuring both May and Taylor playing in the final section of the show. Writer Ben Elton also made an appearance to present a special plaque to the cast, May and Taylor. During the portion of the show based in Pop's bar, the line \"But the Pub Landlord has a Bike\" was followed by a cameo appearance of British comedian Al Murray, who came up through the stage on a motorcycle.\n\nThe London show's sixth anniversary performance was held on 21 May 2008, a week after its actual anniversary due to the unavailability of Brian May. For the first time since the show opened, the Killer Queen character performed the entire song \"Don't Stop Me Now\", a musical number which is normally interrupted by the Khashoggi character. This unique performance is acknowledged by Killer Queen's dialogue: \"No, you didn't let me finish, you never let me finish. For six long years, night after night, week after week, year after year. Well, tonight, I'm going to finish.\" To which Khashoggi replied: \"It's not in the script!\" The Killer Queen proceeded to yell \"Screw the script!\" before continuing the song. Additionally, May joined Killer Queen and the dancers on stage for the performance. After the encore, Elton made a thank you speech, after which the entire cast performed \"The Show Must Go On\", accompanied by May on guitar.\n\nThe seventh anniversary of the London Show was celebrated on Monday 18 May 2009. The show contained a special appearance from Brian May and Ben Elton who emerged together in a cloud of smoke during the encore rendition of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with May playing guitar. As with the year before, Elton gave a thank you speech and the entire cast performed \"The Show Must Go On\", accompanied by May on guitar.\n\nOn Saturday 12 September 2009 at the early matinee performance Brian May again emerged in a cloud of smoke playing the guitar in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". What was the occasion for this appearance is not clear. He did the same again on Saturday 14 November 2009 at the matinee.\n\nOn Sunday 31 January 2010 in The O2 Dublin, Brian May once again played Bohemian Rhapsody with the company during the finale of both the matinee and evening shows to celebrate the end of their year-long tour.\n\nOn Saturday 5 September 2010 Brian also appeared though a cloud of smoke, again to play \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". This was due to the annual cast change, as well as a celebration of what would have been Freddie Mercury's 64th birthday, and afterwards Brian gave a farewell speech to the cast that were leaving.\n\nOn Saturday 5 October 2013, Brian appeared through the cloud of smoke to play Bohemian Rhapsody once more. This was because it was cast change and some of the cast were leaving.

Bassist John Deacon left Queen in 1997, and hasn't performed with May or Taylor since.\n\nWhen Bohemian Rhapsody is performed with Brian and Roger, Brian comes up from a trap in the stage with a lot of smoke (only at Dominion Theatre. Elsewhere he is walking from the Wembley gate in the back, to the front of stage.) He performs the solo right before the opera section. Then the opera section begins, he walks off stage. Doing the headbanging section Roger comes up on the Heartbreak Hotel platform and Brian runs back on stage (only at Dominion Theatre. Elsewhere Roger's drum kit is being pushed by stage crew and Brian runs on stage.) They perform the headbanging section with the cast and the low key section. They end it all with a big ending before the stage goes into blackout.\n\nGalileo Figaro – The central character of the musical; a dreamer who hears strange words in his head. He is eventually revealed to be a reincarnation of Freddie Mercury. The character's name is a reference to the lyrics in the Queen song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".\n\nScaramouche – A sarcastic, cynical character and Galileo's love interest.

Probably named for Iggy Pop or simply a diminutive for \"Grandfather\". In the German production his full name is \"Bap Niedecken\". The name refers to the German band \"Bap\" (Cologne dialect for \"Papa\" = \"Father\") and the singer Wolfgang Niedecken. In the Brazillian production his name is \"Toca Raul\", a reference to Raul Seixas, and to a popular expression associated with him (Toca Raul = Play Raul) but that is also said during many rock concerts in Brazil, regardless of the singer.\n\nOther Bohemians – The other Bohemians have constantly changing names following media trends.

The musical numbers of the original London production are as follows.\n\n\n\nLater in the London production, the \"One Vision\" sequence was changed to include Freddie Mercury's recorded vocals for the bridge. Previously, the bridge had been sung by the ensemble.\n\nIn the original London production, \"Fat-Bottomed Girls\" was a short instrumental interlude prior to \"Another One Bites the Dust\". Subsequent international productions expanded the song into a full song and dance sequence. Due to the positive response, the change was transferred back to the London production.\n\nFor the single-act Las Vegas production, \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" is replaced by \"You're My Best Friend\". In the 2013-2014 North American tour, \"You're My Best Friend\" is added after \"I Want It All.\" \"Who Wants To Live Forever\" is reinstated, after \"Flash\" and \"Seven Seas of Rhye.\"\n\nFor the Australasian tour, Canadian production and the 2013-14 North American tour, \"Play the Game\" is replaced by \"Now I'm Here\".\n\nFor the revamped Canadian production and the 2013-14 North American tour, \"One Vision\" is removed. \"Flash\" and \"Seven Seas Of Rhye\" are repositioned to the start of Act Two.\n\nOn special occasions, \"The Show Must Go On\" is added to the encore.\n\nA cast recording of the original London production was released in November 2002.

It is the only \"We Will Rock You\" cast recording to contain \"Fat Bottomed Girls\".\n\nIn 2012, a \"10th Anniversary Edition\" of the London Cast Recording was issued, comprising the original cast recording album, along with a CD with bonus material.\n\n\nAt the time of launching the musical, Robert De Niro referred to the possibility of a film version.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with the BBC, Brian May said that a film version was proposed, and that Ben Elton had written a full script with a \"grittier\" storyline. He emphasised that a lot more action can be included during the songs in a film than in a stage musical.\n\n\n"}

In Mongolia, Some Üzemchins migrated there from Xilin Gol immediately after China was freed from the Japanese in 1945.\n\nThe Üzemchin was included the Chahar tumen of the six tumen eastern Mongols in Northern Yuan Dynasty. The land of Ongon-Dural, the third son of Bodi Alagh Khan of the Northern Yuan was called Üzemchin.
