First conceived during a meeting of 30 African tax commissioners with representatives of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in August 2008, it was launched in November 2009 in Kampala, Uganda. Through mutual cooperation between member states, ATAF works towards increasing the level of voluntary tax compliance whilst combating tax evasion and avoidance. ATAF is supported by a group of donors including the UK's Department for International Development, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, the African Development Bank, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit, Irish Aid, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands), the OECD, and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs. It collaborates with African regional economic organisations, the Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrations, the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations, the Centre de Rencontres et d'Etudes des Dirigeants des Administrations Fiscales, the Intra-European Organisation of Tax Administrations, and the International Centre for Tax and Development.\n\nAs of October 2015, there are 37 member nations:\n\nATAF offers an online course in tax treaties as well as an executive master's in taxation, in partnership with two Senegalese schools and the Mauritius Revenue Authority. It also offers short courses on taxation and development in partnership with the International Centre for Tax and Development. In 2015, ATAF launched the African Tax Research Network (ATRN), which will hold an annual congress for researchers to share their work. In collaboration with the International Centre for Tax and Development, it will also offer research methods training and dissemination workshops to members of the ATRN.\n\nATAF hosts technical working groups on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, Indirect Taxes, Exchange of Information, and Transfer pricing. In April 2015 it held a consultative conference on BEPS, and provided feedback from its members to the OECD. On exchange of information, ATAF has begun a three-year pilot program which aims to help African countries meet the standards to join the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.\n\nIn October 2015, ATAF held its second international conference on tax in Africa, with the theme \"Tax Compliance and Limiting Illicit financial flows\".\n"}

Geopolitical imaginations are constituted by shared assumptions and representations of power relations and conflicts in world politics within a certain geographical territory. By critically analyzing how and why these imaginations are constructed, it is possible to reveal underlying power relations and to get a better understanding of various conflicts. Therefore, geopolitical imaginations are closely connected to the academic field of critical geopolitics. \n\nGeopolitical imaginations are composed of the representation of a country’s territorial limits and its geopolitical code which is “[...] a set of strategic assumptions that a government makes about other states”. These so-called geopolitical codes are based on national identity (particularly in ‘them’ and ‘us’ distinctions), emotional attachment to a place as well as national myths. Geopolitical imaginations provide the legitimisation for geopolitical actions or certain positions in foreign and domestic policy. \nGeopolitical imaginations are reflections of current discourses and therefore they are not fixed but rather vary over time and in different societies. Research has primarily analyzed geopolitical imaginations of European and North American countries, ignoring the fact that in other socio-political contexts there exist different ‘non-western’ geopolitical imaginations. \n\nThe view of the world as two polarizing ideological blocs (western and eastern bloc) is a geopolitical imagination which was dominant during time of the Cold War. Designations such as the Iron Curtain (the boundary between the bipolar powers) helped to justify certain politics and policies, e.g. in the United States in foreign policy by containment (a military strategy to stop the expansion of the ‘enemy’) or in domestic policy with the expansion of homeland security which enforced technologies of control and disciplining. \nSamuel P. Huntington made a draft of a fragmented conflicted world order. In his popular hypothesis called ”The Clash of Civilizations” (1996), he divided the world map geographically into rigid cultural entities, such as the Western bloc, the Islamic bloc or the African bloc, and proclaimed that the next major conflict will occur between these different cultures. \nIn the 21st century, “hegemonic geographical imaginations are dominated by the affective geopolitics of the War on Terror”. This has been a consequence of the synthesis between the Clash of Civilizations, the terror attacks of 9/11 and the following designations of rogue states (states which have been blamed for threatening the world peace) and the axis of evil (states which have been accused of supporting terrorism and aspiring to weapons of mass destruction). \n\nCritical Geopolitics\n\nGeopolitics\n\nImagined geographies\n\n"}

Its Executive Director is a former World Bank Chief Spokesman Tim Cullen MBE. Cullen, a Commissioner on the Isle of Man Financial Supervision Commission and an Associate Fellow at Oxford University's Said Business School was instrumental in creating the Centre’s Small Countries Financial Management Programme (SCFMP), an initiative which brings together officials from an extremely diverse range of small countries. Participants come from finance ministries, central banks and regulatory bodies. The programme offers a support mechanism through which they can exchange ideas, share their own countries’ challenges and give each other practical assistance. The acquisition of negotiation skills is a priority, and participants learn from leading practitioners and professors. \n\nPartners of the Centre include the Isle of Man Government, the World Bank the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the Small States Network for Economic Development. Initial funding was provided by the Isle of Man Government.\n\nThe Centre’s inaugural nine-day programme, designed and directed by Ron Emerson took place in September 2009 at both the Isle of Man International Business School and Oxford University, and continues, covering key issues such as risk assessment, management and regulation, debt and cash management, and regulatory collaboration. The 2011 Programme was held in the Isle of Man and at St Catherine's College, Oxford and was directed by Alison McQuater.\n\n"}
