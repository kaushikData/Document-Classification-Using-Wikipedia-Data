While the specific methods promoted for achieving this goal shifted over the next several decades, the Campaign adhered to the concept of a populist global federalism throughout its existence.\n\nThe Campaign's early platform was outlined in 1937 in their pamphlet \"Chaos, War or a New World Order?\" which called for the creation of a World Constitutional Convention. At this convention, it was hoped, a framework for a Federation of Nations would be formed, and democratic elections to the federation would be scheduled. Schwimmer and Lloyd included a tentative plan for this novel federal body, including full membership for all countries, direct representation, and several organs of government. Among the plan's elements were a new international date system, the abolition of all military bodies, the peaceful transfer of people out of population-dense regions, and a combined global free-trade and command economy.\n\nOver time, as Schwimmer and Lloyd recognized the increasing unlikelihood of national governments voluntarily forming a world government, their plan shifted emphasis to the peaceful popular demand for the election of such a body. Following this shift, the Campaign began to focus on national consciousness-raising and international conferences of other like-minded groups.\n"}

It traverses the Karakorum Mountains, one of the world's tallest mountain ranges.\n\nThe modern border dates from the period of the Raj when Britain controlled India, including what is now Pakistan. In 1899 the British, via its envoy to China Sir Claude MacDonald, proposed what became known as the MacDonald Line to the Chinese government, however the Chinese never responded to the proposal and thus the border was never formalised.\n\nOver the following decades a variety of maps were issues by all sides in the dispute, showing wildly varying boundaries. India and Pakistan inherited the dispute upon independence in 1947, further complicated by their dispute over ownership of Jammu and Kashmir. The issue came to the fore in the early 1960s, at a time of intense tension in the region due to ongoing failure to solve the Indo-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir, a much greater Chinese presence in Tibet, and the Sino-Indian War of 1962 in which China had seized control of the Indian-claimed Aksai Chin region. In 1961 China and Pakistan agreed in principle to demarcate their common border; negotiations commenced the following year, with the final Sino-Pakistan Agreement being signed in 1963. Both sides made concessions in the treaty, including Pakistani giving China the area known around the Shaksgam Valley known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract. Following the treaty a series of maps and aerial surveys of the border area were made and boundary pillars were installed.\n\nThe 1963 Sino-Pakistani agreement delimited the boundary as follows:\n\n\"Article Two\n… (1) Commencing from its northwestern extremity at height 5,630 metres (a peak, the\nreference co-ordinates of which are approximately Longitude 74° 34' E and Latitude 37°\n03' N), the boundary line runs generally eastward and then southeastward strictly along the\nmain watershed between the tributaries of the Tashkurgan River of the Tarim River system\non the one hand and the tributaries of the Hunza River of the Indus River system on the other hand, passing through the Kilik Daban (Dawan), the Mintaka Daban (Pass), the Kharchanai Daban (named on the Chinese map only), the Kutejilga Daban (named on the\nChinese map only), and the Parpik Pass (named on the Pakistan map only), and reaches\nthe Khunjerab (Yutr) Daban (Pass).\n\n(2) After passing through the Khunjerab (Yutr) Daban (Pass), the boundary line runs\ngenerally southward along the above-mentioned main watershed up to a mountaintop south\nof the Daban (Pass), where it leaves the main watershed to follow the crest of a spur lying\ngenerally in a south-easterly direction, which is the watershed between the Akjilga River (a\nnameless corresponding river on the Pakistan map) on the one hand, and the\nTaghdumbash (Oprang River) and the Keliman Su (Oprang Jilga) on the other hand.\nAccording to the map of the Chinese side, the boundary line, after leaving the southeastern\nextremity of this spur, runs along a small section of the middle line of the bed of the Keliman\nSu to reach its confluence with the Kelechin River. According to the map of the Pakistan\nside, the boundary line, after leaving the southeastern extremity of this spur, reaches the\nsharp bend of the Shaksgam or Mustagh River.\n\n(3) From the aforesaid point, the boundary line runs up the Kelechin River (Shaksgam or\nMuztagh River) along the middle line of its bed to its confluence (reference co-ordinates\napproximately Longitude 76° 02' E. and Latitude 36° 26' N.) with the Sorbulak Daria\n(Shimshal River or Braldu River).\n\n(4) From the confluence of the aforesaid two rivers, the boundary line, according to the\nmap of the Chinese side, ascends the crest of a spur and runs along it to join the\nKarakoram Range main watershed at a mountain-top (reference co-ordinates\napproximately Longitude 75° 54' E. and Latitude 36° 15' N.), which on this map is shown\nas belonging to the Shorbulak Mountain. According to the map of the Pakistan side, the\nboundary line from the confluence of the above-mentioned two rivers ascends the crest of a\ncorresponding spur and runs along it; passing through Height 6,520 metres (21,300 feet)\ntill it joins the Karakoram Range main watershed at a peak (reference co-ordinates\napproximately Longitude 75° 57' E. and Latitude 36° 03' N.).\n\n(5) Thence, the boundary line, running generally southward and then eastward, strictly\nfollows the Karakoram Range main watershed which separates the Tarim River drainage\nsystem from the Indus River drainage system, passing through the East Mustagh Pass\n(Muztagh Pass), the top of the Chogri Peak (K2), the top of the Broad Peak, the top of the\nGasherbrum Mountain (8068) Indirakoli Pass (named on the Chinese map only) and the\ntop of the Teram Kangri Peak, and reaches its southeastern extremity at the Karakoram\nPass.\"\n\nThe border is not recognised by India, which claims the whole of Jammu and Kashmir state, a claim which negates any Sino-Pakistani border and indeed would give India a common border with Afghanistan. India refuses to recognise the legality of the 1963 Sino-Pakistan treaty or the cession of the Trans-Karakorum Tract (Shaksgam Valley) to China, a position further complicated by the fact that large sections of the rest of the China-India boundary are also disputed. In 1984 India occupied the Siachen glacier in Kashmir, thereby altering the de facto China-Inda-Pakistan tripoint. Article 6 of the 1963 Sino-Pakistan treaty provides for a renegotiation of the China-Pakistan boundary if the Kashmir dispute is resolved. However, with Indian relations still cool with China, and poor-to-hostile with Pakistan, it is unlikely the boundary dispute will be resolved soon.\n\nThe Khunjerab Pass is the only modern day border crossing between China and Pakistan, accessed via the Karakorum Highway. Historically the Mintaka Pass and Kilik Pass have also been used; however those crossings do not have vehicle access and are closed.\n\n"}

{"id": "93816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93816", "title": "Criticisms of globalization", "text": "Criticisms of globalization\n\nCriticism of globalization is skepticism of the claimed benefits of globalization. Many of these views are held by the anti-globalization movement. Globalization has created much global and internal unrest in many countries. While the dynamics of capitalism is changing and each country is unique in its political makeup, globalization is a set-in-stone \"program\" that is difficult to implement without political unrest. Globalization can be partly responsible for the current global economic crisis. Case studies of Thailand and the Arab nations' view of globalization show that globalization is a threat to culture and religion, and it harms indigenous people groups while multinational corporations profit from it. Although globalization has promised an improved standard of living and economic development, it has been heavily criticized for its production of negative effects. Globalization is not simply an economic project, but it also heavily influences the country environmentally, politically, and socially as well.\n\nThe founder of Local Futures (formerly the International Society for Ecology and Culture), Helena Norberg-Hodge, has suggested that globalization does not work for all the economies that it affects and that it does not always deliver the economic growth that is expected of it.\n\nGlobalization has been described as an \"uneven process\" in Africa due to the global integration of some groups happening alongside the marginalization or exclusion of others. Therefore, the worldwide trade will have the restrictions on the growth of economy.\n\nThe Global Economic Crisis, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, can be partially attributed to neoliberal globalization. Although globalization promised an improved standard of living, it has actually worsened the financial situation of many homes and has made the financial crisis global through the influences of international financial institutions such as the World Bank. Globalization limits development and civilization to a path that only leads to a Western and capitalistic system. Because of the political and structural differences in countries, the implementation of globalization has been detrimental for many countries.\n\nJohn Gray described globalization as a post-Cold War American triumphalism, and stated “global laissez faire is an American project.” Globalization is a project in which American ideals and values are executed and implemented into other countries. However, this effort has been criticized, mainly by the examination of America today. In America, there are high levels of economic and social inequalities as the gap between the rich and poor are great. Furthermore, America has the highest rates of incarceration, and anxiety due to economic uncertainty is great. The criticism that follows is that the implementation of the American system into other countries may reproduce these negative effects.\n\nGlobalization has fueled the rise of transnational corporations, and their power has vaulted to the point where they can now rival many nation states. Of the world's one hundred largest economies, forty-two of them are corporations.[\"\"] Many of these transnational corporations now hold sway over many nation states, as their fates are intertwined with the nations that they are located in.\n\nAlso, transnational corporations could offer massive influence regarding the Third World, and bring about more pressure to help increase worker salaries and working conditions in sweatshops. However, these corporations are often transnational specifically to take advantage of different labor laws, which they can keep implemented with their influence and exploit for their gain. On account of doing the business globally, transnational corporations have the huge influence in many nation states.\n\nIn the process of implementing globalization in developing countries, the creation of winners and losers are often predetermined. Multinational corporations often benefit from globalization while poor, indigenous locals are negatively affected. The power of transnational companies inflicts a major threat for indigenous tribes. Transnational companies have exploited local family land for their businesses. Globalization can be seen as a new form of colonization or imperialism, as economic inequality and the rise in unemployment have followed with its implementation. Globalization has been criticized for benefiting those who are already large and in power at the risk and growing vulnerability of the countries’ indigenous population. Furthermore, globalization is non-democratic, as it is enforced through top-down methods.\n\nGlobalization requires a country to give up its sovereignty for the sake of executing Western ideals in its country. As a result, sovereignty only belongs to a select few: those whose views and ideals are being implemented. In the name of free markets and with the promise of an improved standard of living, countries give up their political and social powers to international organizations. Thus, globalization causes the greater empowerment of these international organizations and the diminishing influence of local state institutions.\n\nInternational trade in petroleum products has expanded significantly over the past decades through globalization so that the environmental problems in Nigeria have been deteriorated. As the international trade in petroleum products keeps increasing, there is also corresponding increase in activities in the petroleum industry to meet the requirement of the ever increasing demand for petroleum products. As a result, it gives rise to the environmental pollution. The petroleum is toxic to almost all forms of life and its extraction fuels climate change including air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, land degradation and erosion.\n\nInfection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious diseases, also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, kill more people worldwide than any other single cause. Infectious diseases are caused by germs, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. Germs are tiny living things that are found everywhere in air, soil and water. One can get infected by touching, eating, drinking or breathing something that contains germs. Infectious diseases, such as SARS and Ebola, have traveled across the world due to increased world trade and tourism.\n\nAs International commerce develops new trade routes, markets and products Globalization facilitates the spread of invasive species. The modern technology offer the opportunity that human and commodities can move around the world. On account of the development of new source, larger and faster ships and increased air transport, the commercial trade propels rising annual and cumulative rates of invasion.\n\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s, hydropower dam projects were conducted in order to recreate Thailand’s economy into an export-oriented economy. The projects were funded by loans from the World Bank and was part of globalization efforts. The local villagers whom the project would directly affect were not notified, and the World Bank disregarded their concerns. As a result of the building of the dams, villages that heavily depended on the river lost their livelihood and their means of economic gains (i.e., fishing). The projects contaminated the river, which made the river unfit for villagers to drink, bathe, and do laundry without experiencing negative health conditions such as rashes. Furthermore, the projects resulted in the extinction of 40 edible plant species, 45 mushroom species, and 10 bamboo species, all of which the income of the local markets were dependent on, some of which were important for medical usage. Furthermore, the decline in fish population exterminated fishermen’s ways of life, as 169 different fish species were affected and 56 species became extinct. The globalization efforts in Thailand resulted in environmental impacts that affected the social and economic welfare of indigenous populations.\n\nWith the centralization of agriculture throughout the world, food must go exceptionally long distances to reach consumers. As a result, transportation of goods increases, an industry which is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions.[\"\"]\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, put forward globalization as a factor of an increase in the inequality of outcomes in societies.\n\nGlobalization has been one of the main causes of the increase in inequality in many countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. These countries, including the United States, Canada, and Argentina, have faced an increase in inequality by between one-half to one-third between the 1970s and the late 1990s.\n\nAcceleration in language death has been attributed to globalization, and is predicted to continue. \n\nProfessor Conor Gearty, of the London School of Economics, has suggested that global freedom of movement, brought on by globalization, has increased the scope for prejudice within societies. \n\nThe collision between global and local cultures have created challenges in adapting to and reconciling the two. Globalization and the introduction of the Western culture in different countries have shown to produce bicultural identities, identity confusion, and self-selected cultures.\n\nBicultural identity is defined as one adapting to the global culture while simultaneously being familiar with local traditions. As a result, two identities are formed: global identity and local identity. One’s global identity allows for him/her to participate and succeed globally by being able to relate to those outside of his/her local sphere. One’s local identity allows him/her to still be relevant to family and friends nearby. Often, those experiencing globalization in their country are seen to develop a \"hybrid identity\", an identity in which merges their global and local identities. This can also be seen with immigrants.\n\nHowever, adapting to both cultures may be difficult, especially if the distance between the two cultures is great. In these cases, globalization may cause identity confusion, preventing the proper development of identity and self (Erikson’s theory of identity formation). Similarly, globalization may create a crisis in which John Berry calls “marginalization,” in which one is unable to identify with local culture due to the heavy exposure of globalization and Western influences; however he/she is also excluded from the global culture as well.\n\nThe implementation of globalization requires a certain degree of culture shedding, as global culture alters and disrupts the preexisting local culture. This also leads to identity confusion, primarily in adolescents.\n\nMany times, in countries where globalization is introduced, problems that arise among adolescents are often blamed to the intrusion of Western culture and ideals through globalization. Adolescents are most vulnerable and receptive to the introduction of new cultures. Developing countries where Western values and technology have been introduced are more aware of current events taking place in other countries, and adolescents and youths can be seen copying American fashion and music styles. Therefore, Western media is blamed for the rise in premarital sex and teenage pregnancies that follow when globalization is introduced.\n\nGlobalization claims to have improved countries’ global status. However, companies attempting to compete globally have exploited workers, and global competition has been achieved through poor working conditions. Furthermore, due to global influences, juvenile crimes have increased because of the disruption of traditional norms.\n\nThe Arab and Islamic countries see globalization as an attempt to instill Western superiority and a threat to the preservation of their cultural identity. Although differing views of globalization exist among Arab nations, a large percentage of Muslims see it to be imperialistic and a cultural invasion that attempts to destroy their heritage and cultural beliefs.\n\nDespite the differing opinions of globalization, almost all acknowledge and believe that globalization is simply Americanism— the implementation of American cultures and ideals into other countries.\n\nGlobalization is especially threatening to Arab nations because Islam is not simply a religious practice, but it dominates laws and social norms such as marriages and spending habits. Since globalization is seen to be a way of secularizing a nation, Muslims also see it as a cultural and religious invasion, requiring the separation of religion and daily life. Radicalists see it as a perversion of pure Islamic doctrine, as globalization is seen to merge the domain of Islam (Dar al-Islam) and the domain of infidelity (Dar-al-Kufr).\n\nThe Western influence on media is also unwelcome. The Western control of media is viewed as a way to brainwash young Muslims to strip them of their nationality and cultural heritage. They also oppose the creation of a new, global, hegemonic culture, referencing the Quran (49:13) which states that God has purposefully divided mankind into different nations and tribes. Arab intellectuals have stated that globalization rids the earth of human cultural diversity and civilizations’ peculiarities, which many see as barbaric. Authors and publishers have expressed fear of Western ideals penetrating their nations.\n\n"}

The Bohemian possessions of the Eggenbergs later went to Hans Ulrich's son, Johann Anton von Eggenberg (1610–1649).\n\nIn 1649, the title passed to Johann Anton's son, Johann Christian von Eggenberg. He married Marie Ernestine of Schwarzenberg, who was a member of the noble House of Schwarzenberg. Upon the death of Johann Christian, the male line of the House of Eggenberg came to an end. \n\nThe death of Marie Ernestine in 1719 caused the Bohemian possessions of the Eggenbergs to pass to her closest relatives in the Schwarzenberg family. As a result, the Duchy of Krumlov was obtained by Prince Adam Francis Charles of Schwarzenberg in 1723, and the title of Duke of Krumlov is reserved for the head of the House of Schwarzenberg.\n\n"}

Every Maltese citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Economic Area, as well as Switzerland.\n\nMaltese passports share the common design standards of European Union passports. The cover is burgundy with the coat of arms of Malta emblazoned in the centre. The words \"UNJONI EWROPEA\" (English: European Union) and \"MALTA\" are inscribed above the coat of arms, with \"PASSAPORT\" (English: Passport) and the international biometric passport symbol below.\n\nIn January 2014 Malta started granting citizenship for a €650,000 contribution plus investments, contingent on residence and criminal background requirements, under the so-called \"Individual Investor Programme\"\nHenley & Partners was originally appointed as sole agent for the sale of Maltese passport, but the Muscat government later opened the scheme to Maltese firms too. The procedure is managed formally by the governmental agency Identity Malta.\nThe number and background of persons granted Maltese citizenship based on investment is unknown, as the Maltese government does not publish such data. Malta's Data Protection Commissioner confirmed that the publication of the number of passport buyers and their country of origin “may prejudice relations with a number of the countries of origin” and that revealing the agencies that handled their application “could reasonably be expected to prejudice commercial interests and, ultimately, the competitiveness of approved agents as it would reveal commercially-sensitive information”.\nThe list of persons who were naturalised Maltese in the year 2015 includes over 900 names (listed by first name) without indication of previous/second citizenships and of reasons for naturalisation. This was criticised as not transparent enough. Many of the names are typical Arab, Russian, and Chinese names. \nMost \"investors\" are understood to be interested in acquiring Maltese citizenship only as a tool to exploit EU citizenship rights and reside elsewhere in the Union, including the UK. The European Parliament had objected to the programme as a sell-out of EU citizenship.\nThe income from Malta's passport sale amounted to €163.5 million in 2016. Of this, 70% is deposited in the so-called National Development and Social Fund (NDSF), which was set up in July 2016. The use of the fund by the government is not regulated.\n\nVisa requirements for Maltese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Malta. As of 20 October 2018, Maltese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 183 countries and territories, ranking the Maltese passport 7th in the world (tied with Australian and Greek passports) according to the Henley Passport Index. Additionally, Arton Capital's Passport Index ranked the Maltese passport 5th in the world in terms of travel freedom, with a visa-free score of 161 (tied with Australian, Icelandic, Malaysian, and New Zealand passports), as of 20 October 2018.\n\nMaltese citizens can live and work in any country within the European Economic Area (consisting of the states of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association) as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n\n\n"}
