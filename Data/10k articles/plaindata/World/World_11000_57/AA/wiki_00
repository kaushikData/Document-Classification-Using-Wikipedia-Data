{"id": "7878109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7878109", "title": "Abahlali baseMjondolo", "text": "Abahlali baseMjondolo\n\nAbahlali baseMjondolo (, \"Shack Dwellers\"), also known as AbM or the red shirts, is a shack-dwellers' movement in South Africa well known for its campaigning against evictions and for public housing. The movement grew out of a road blockade organised from the Kennedy Road shack settlement in the city of Durban in early 2005 and now also operates in the cities of Pietermaritzburg and in Cape Town. It is the largest shack dweller's organisation in South Africa and campaigns to improve the living conditions of poor people and to democratise society from below.\n\nThe movement historically refused party politics, and has boycotted elections and has a history of conflict with both the African National Congress and the Democratic Alliance. (Despite this, it announced its support for the Democratic Alliance in the 2014 elections.) Its key demand is that the social value of urban land should take priority over its commercial value and it campaigns for the public expropriation of large privately owned landholdings. The key organising strategy is to try \"to recreate Commons\" from below by trying to create a series of linked communes.\n\nAccording to \"The Times\", the movement \"has shaken the political landscape of South Africa.\" According to Professor Peter Vale, Abahlali baseMjondolo is \"along with the Treatment Action Campaign the most effective grouping in South African civil society.\" Khadija Patel has written that the movement \"is at the forefront of a new wave of mass political mobilisation\". However the movement has faced sustained, and at times violent, repression.\n\nIn 2001, the eThekwini Municipality, which governs Durban and Pinetown, embarked on a 'slum clearance programme' that meant the steady demolition of shack settlements and a refusal to provide basic services (e.g. electricity, sanitation etc.) to existing settlements on the grounds that all shack settlements were now 'temporary'. In these demolitions some shack dwellers were simply being left homeless and others subjected to unlawful forced evictions to the rural periphery of the city. In early 2008, the United Nations expressed serious concern about the treatment of shack dwellers in Durban. In the run up to 2010 there was also concern about the possibility of evictions linked to the 2010 FIFA World Cup across South Africa and abroad.\n\nAbahlali's original work was primarily committed to opposing demolitions and forced removals and to struggling for good land and quality housing in the cities. In most instances this takes the form of a demand for shack settlements to be upgraded with formal housing and services where they are or for new houses to be built close to where the existing settlements are. However the movement has also argued that basic services such as water, electricity and toilets should be immediately provided to shack settlements while land and housing in the city are negotiated. The movement has also engaged in the mass popular appropriation of access to water and electricity.\n\nThe movement quickly had a considerable degree of success in stopping evictions and forced removals, winning the right for new shacks to be built as settlements expand and in winning access to basic services, but for three years was not able to win secure access to good urban land for quality housing. In late 2008 the then AbM President S'bu Zikode announced a deal with the eThekwini Municipality which would see services being provided to 14 settlements and tenure security and formal housing to three. The municipality confirmed this deal in February 2009.\n\nThe movement has been involved in considerable conflict with the eThekwini Municipality and has undertaken numerous protests and legal actions against the city authorities. Its members have been beaten and many of its leaders arrested by the South African Police Service in Sydenham, Durban.\n\nAbahlali has often made claims of severe police harassment, including torture. On a number of occasions, these claims have been supported by church leaders and human rights organisations. The movement has successfully sued the police for unlawful assaults on its members.\n\nIn October 2009, the movement won a constitutional court case which declared the KZN Slums Act unconstitutional. In the same year there was acute conflict between the movement and the Cape Town City Council which centred on the Macassar Village Land Occupation. There was similar conflict in 2013 which centred on the Marikana Land Occupation.\n\nAcademic work on the movement stresses that it is non-professionalised (i.e. its leaders are nonsalaried), independent of NGO control, autonomous from political organisations and party politics and democratic. Sarah Cooper-Knock describes the movement as \"neurotically democratic, impressively diverse and steadfastly self-critical\". Ercument Celik writes that \"I experienced how democratically the movement ran its meetings.\"\n\nThe movement has, along with the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, refused to work with the NGO-run 'Social Movements Indaba' (SMI), and some of the NGOs involved with the SMI. The movement has been particularly critical of the Centre for Civil Society at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and refuses to work with the Centre.\n\nIn 2010 the movement claimed to have around 25,000 active supporters in 64 different shack settlements of which just over 10 000 were paid up card carrying members. The movement has affiliated settlements and branches in non-affiliated settlements and also a has a youth league and a women's league.\n\nSince 2005, the movement has carried out a series of large scale marches, created numerous dual power institutions and engaged in direct action such as land occupations and self organised water and electricity connections and made tactical use of the courts. The movement has often made anti-capitalist statements, has called for \"a living communism\", and has demanded the expropriation of private land for public housing.\n\nAbahlali historically refused to participate in party politics or any NGO-style professionalisation or individualisation of struggle and instead sought to build democratic people's power where people lived and worked. Academic work claims that the movement has protected its autonomy from political parties and NGOs. However, in 2014, Abahlali was critiqued for endorsing the Democratic Alliance in the 2014 national elections. Nonetheless Abahlali announced it endorsed the Democratic Alliance in the 2014 national election solely as part of a strategy to vote out any standing party that fails to deliver on its political promises \n\nThe movement campaigns for well located urban land for public housing and has occupied unused government land.\n\nA primary demand of the movement has been for decent, public housing and much of its work takes the form of opposing evictions. The movement has often used the phrase 'The Right to the City' to insist that the location of housing is critically important and demands that shack settlements are upgraded where they are and that people are not relocated to out of town developments. The movement rejects technocratic approaches to the housing crisis and stresses the need for dignity to be central to the resolution of the housing crisis. It is opposed to shack dwellers being moved into 'transit camps'.\n\nThe movement opposes all evictions and forced removals and has campaigned vigorously on this score via public protest and, also, legal action.\n\nThe movement has also campaigned for the provision of basic services to shack settlements.\n\nIn South Africa, there are an average of \"ten shack fires a day with someone dying in a shack fire every other day\". Abahlali has campaigned on this issue demanding, amongst other things, the electrification of shacks. It has also connected thousands of people to electricity.\n\nThe movement campaigns for equal access to school education for poor children.\n\nSince 2005, Abahlali baseMjondolo refused to vote in all state elections. The movement stated that it aimed, instead, to use direct democracy to build a counter power to that of the state by creating a series of linked collectives and communes. This position is shared by all the organisations in the Poor People's Alliance. However, in 2014 it abandoned this position and urged its members to vote for the Democratic Alliance.\n\nThe movement has organised a number of mutual aid projects: crèches, kitchens and vegetable gardens.\n\nAbahlali baseMjondolo took the Provincial Government of KwaZulu-Natal to court to have the controversial Slums Act declared unconstitutional. but lost the case. On 14 May 2009, it took the case on appeal to the Constitutional Court. Judgment was handed down on 14 October 2009 and the movement won the case with costs.\n\nThe movement took a strong stand against the xenophobic attacks that swept the country in May 2008 and there were no attacks in any Abahlali settlements. The movement was also able to stop an in-progress attack in the (non-Abahlali affiliated) Kenville settlement and to offer shelter to some people displaced in the attacks.\n\nThe movement has organised numerous actions against police racism and brutality and has often demanded fair access to policing services for shack dwellers.\n\nThe movement runs formal courses and issues certification for these. It also hosts regular seminars. The movement reports that topics covered have ranged from computer skills to training in safely connecting shacks to water and electricity, to questions of law and policy, to political ideas like the right to the city, questions of political strategy and to the work of a philosopher like Jacques Ranciere.\n\nAbahlali baseMjondolo of the Western Cape threatened to build shacks outside of the Cape Town stadium to draw attention to their situation but were not able to make good on this threat.\n\nThe movement describes itself as \"a homemade politics that everyone can understand and find a home in\" and stresses that it moves from the lived experience of the poor to create a politics that is both intellectual and actional.\n\nIts philosophy has been sketched out in a number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects to the idea of a living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but from the experience of the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.\n\nWhile the movement is clear that its key immediate goals are 'land and housing' it is equally clear that it sees its politics as going beyond this. S'bu Zikode has commented that: \"We have seen in certain cases in South Africa where governments have handed out houses simply to silence the poor. This is not acceptable to us. Abahalali’s struggle is beyond housing. We fight for respect and dignity. If houses are given to silence the poor then those houses are not acceptable to us.\"\n\n'Abahlalism' has on occasion been described as anarchist or autonomist in practice. This is primarily because its praxis correlates closely with central tenets of anarchism, including decentralisation, opposition to imposed hierarchy, direct democracy and recognition of the connection between means and ends. However, the movement has never described itself as either anarchist or autonomist. Zikode has said that the movement aspires to 'a living communism'.\n\nThe movement, together with similar grassroots movements in Johannesburg and Cape Town, takes a very critical stance towards state elections in South Africa. They have boycotted the local government elections in 2006, the national government elections in 2009 and the 2011 local government elections under the banner of No Land! No House! No Vote!. It has been reported that \"Nearly 75% of South Africans aged 20-29 did not vote in the 2011 [local government] elections\" and that \"South Africans in that age group were more likely to have taken part in violent street protests against the local ANC than to have voted for the ruling party\".\n\nThe philosophy of Abahlali baseMjondolo with regards to elections can be summarised by the following statement from its elected president S'bu Zikode, \"The government and academics speak about the poor all the time, but so few want to speak to the poor...It becomes clear that our job is just to vote and then watch the rich speak about us as we get poorer\".\n\nThe movement's Deputy President, Lindela Figlan has argued that “Voting someone into government just gives them power to oppress and exploit us.”\n\nDespite this sentiment, at the Abahlali baseMjondolo \"Unfreedom Day\" rally held in Kwa-Mashu on 27 April 2014, the movement's President Sbu Zikode announced that they \"would abandon their No Land, No House, No Vote campaign and cast a “strategic vote” in the May 7 elections\". A few days later Zikode signed a pact with the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), stating that \"We encourage our comrades and our membership to vote for the Democratic Alliance so that we can get rid of corruption\". Zikode clarified that \"Abahlali are not joining DA or any political party. We will remain independent from all kinds of mainstream political parties. But this time around it's a tactical partnership where the aim is to really get rid of the party that has become a threat to the society\". The DA welcomed Abahali's endorsement, stating that this had come after two years of engagement.\n\nIn the early days of the movement, individuals in the ruling party often accused Abahlali of being criminals manipulated by a malevolent white man, a 'third force', or a foreign intelligence agency.\n\nThe movement, like others in South Africa, has suffered sustained illegal harassment from the state that has resulted in more than 200 arrests of Abahlali members in the first last three years of its existence and repeated police brutality in people's homes, in the streets and in detention. On a number of occasions, the police used live ammunition, armoured vehicles and helicopters in their attacks on unarmed shack dwellers. In 2006 the local city manager, Mike Sutcliffe, unlawfully implemented a complete ban on Abahlali's right to march which was eventually overturned in court. Abahlali have been violently prevented from accepting invitations to appear on television and radio debates by the local police. The Freedom of Expression Institute has issued a number of statements in strong support of Abahlali's right to speak out and to organise protests. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions and a group of prominent church leaders have also issued public statements against police violence, as has Bishop Rubin Philip in his individual capacity, and in support of the right of the movement to publicly express dissent.\n\nIn March 2008, the Mercury newspaper reported that both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International were investigating human rights abuses against shack dwellers by the city government.\n\nIn 2009 the movement was attacked in the Kennedy Road settlement - see below.\n\nIn April 2010, IRIN, the newsletter of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, reported that \"The rise of an organised poor people's movement [Abahlali baseMjondolo] in South Africa's most populous province, KwaZulu-Natal, is being met with increasing hostility by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) government.\n\nIn April 2013 the movement successfully sued the Minister of Police for violence against three of its members.\n\nOn the 26th of June a local AbM leader, Nkululeko Gwala, was assassinated in the Cato Crest shack settlement in Durban.\n\nOn 29 September 2014, another Abahlali baseMjondolo member was killed. Thuli Ndlovu, the movement chairperson for KwaNdengezi was assassinated in her home after disputes with a local councillor over housing allocation.\n\nThe movement has received strong support from some key church leaders. In a speech at the AbM UnFreedom Day event on 27 April 2008 Anglican Bishop Rubin Phillip said that:\n\n\"The courage, dignity and gentle determination of Abahlali baseMjodolo has been a light that has shone ever more\nbrightly over the last three years. You have faced fires, sickness, evictions, arrest, beatings, slander, and still you stand bravely for what is true. Your principle that everyone matters, that every life is precious, is very simple but it is also utterly profound. Many of us who hold dear the most noble traditions of our country take hope from your courage and your dignity.\"\n\nThe Italian theologian Brother Filippo Mondini has attempted to develop a theology based on the political thought and practices developed in Abahlali baseMjondolo.\n\nThe movement makes considerable use of cellphones to organise, generates its own media where possible and has made use of films too. The award-winning documentary feature film \"Dear Mandela\" tells the story of three young activists in Abahlali baseMjondolo.\n\nIn September 2008, the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, together with Abahlali baseMjondolo, the Landless People's Movement and the Rural Network (Abahlali baseplasini) formed The Poor People's Alliance which is \"a co-alition of independent social movements. The Poor People's Alliance refuses electoral politics under the banner 'No Land! No House! No Vote!'.\n\nAbahlali baseMjondolo has also organised in solidarity with the Unemployed Peoples' Movement.\n\nThere is an AbM Solidarity Group in England and the movement has links with the following organisations:\n\nAccording to eThekwini City Manager Dr. Michael Sutcliffe, the essence of the tensions between Abahlali baseMjondolo and the City lie in the fact that the movement \"rejects the authority of the city.\" When the Durban High Court ruled that his attempts to ban marches by Abahlali baseMjondolo were unlawful he stated that: \"We will be asking serious questions of the court because we cannot allow anarchy having anyone marching at any time and any place.\" According to Lennox Mabaso, spokesperson for the Provincial Department of Housing, the movement is \"under the sway of an agent provocateur\" who is \"engaged in clandestine operations\" and who has been \"assigned to provoke unrest\". City Officials continue to argue that the movement is a Third Force seeking to undermine the ruling African National Congress for nefarious purposes.\n\nIn December 2006, Abahlali members and members of the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign, disrupted a meeting of the Social Movements Indaba at the University of KwaZulu Natal and staged a protest. Some academics and NGO activists, all of whom have clear links to a local NGO, the Centre for Civil Society, claimed that this was criminal behaviour and somehow illegitimate in that, according to these people, it was in response to the dismissal of four Abahlali linked academics from the Centre. However the WC-AEC issued a statement vigorously rejecting these claims while the \"Mail and Guardian\" newspaper reported a very different account of why Abahlali protested the meeting. A masters thesis by Matt Birkinshaw explained that the protest happened because \"Abahlali felt that there was a lack of genuine democracy and participation due to NGO co-optation\" in the SMI. Online video footage of the protest shot by Antonios Vradis indicates that the demonstration was peaceful and rational and that the movements had a clear critique of the NGO co-option of the SMI.\n\nIn October 2010, Abahlali baseMjondolo of the Western Cape called for a month of direct action. Mzonke Poni, the chairperson of the Cape Town structure at the time, publicly endorsed road blockades as a legitimate tactic during this strike. The Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) and the South African Communist Party, the latter a major ally of the ruling ANC, issued strong statements condemning the campaign and labelling it 'violent' and, 'anarchist' and reactionary'. AbM responded by saying that their support for road blockades was not violent and that \"We have never called for violence. Violence is harm to human beings. Blockading a road is not violence.\" They also said that the SACP's attack was really due to the movement's insistence on organising autonomously from the African National Congress. After the strike by AbM Western Cape, there were some protests in TR section of Khayelitsha in which vehicles were damaged. AbM WC ascribed these protests to the ANC Youth League as did Helen Zille and the Youth League itself. According to \"Leadership Magazine\" \"The ANC Youth League in the province has hijacked the peaceful service-delivery protests organised by the social movement Abahlali baseMjondolo in Khayelitsha in a violent, destructive and desperate attempt to mobilise support for the ANC against the province's Democratic Alliance provincial and municipal governments.\"\n\nOn 26 September 2009, it was reported that at about 11 pm that evening a group of about 40 people entered the Kennedy Road settlement wielding guns and knives and attacked an Abahlali baseMjondolo youth meeting. The attackers chanted ethnic and ANC slogans, demolished residents' homes and threatened to kill named individuals. At about 5 am the next morning two people were killed in the resulting conflict. According to an Abahlali baseMjondolo press statement issued on 27 September 2009 \"As far as we know two of the attackers were killed when people managed to take their bush knives off them. This was self defence.\n\nIt was reported by members of the Abahlali baseMjondolo movement that the attackers were affiliated with the local branch of the African National Congress and it was claimed that the attack was carefully planned and sanctioned by the local police. However this was denied by the ANC and the police who blamed a 'forum' associated with Abahlali baseMjondolo for the violence. However academic research confirmed that the attackers did self identify as ANC members and that ANC leaders at Municipal and Provincial level later provided public sanction for the attack.\n\nThe \"Mail & Guardian\" newspaper described the attack on Kennedy Road as a \"hatchet job\" and reported that \"Two weeks earlier, eThekwini regional chairperson John Mchunu, addressing the ANC's regional general council, had specifically condemned the ABM for trying to divide the tripartite alliance\" and that an ANC source had confirmed there \"was a battle for the hearts and minds of the people of Kennedy Road ... There is a political twist to this thing.\" The \"Mercury\" newspaper later reported that \"The chairperson of the ANC's biggest and most influential region in KwaZulu-Natal, John Mchunu, has been awarded tenders [in housing construction] worth at least R40-million by the eThekwini municipality. Abahlali baseMjondolo claims to have been at the \"forefront of exposing local government corruption, especially in the allocation of housing.\"\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal Department of Safety and Security held meetings for stakeholders after the attack however these were condemned as unrepresentative by church leaders, AbM representatives and a survey by the \"Mail and Guardian Newspaper\" which described them as \"a sham\". AbM said that they were victims of a 'purge' and that they refused to sit side by side with their attackers and called for an independent investigation into the attacks that should \"in the interests of justice and truth, carefully and fairly investigate the actions of everyone, including the local and provincial ANC, the police, the intelligence services, the prosecutors, the courts and our movement, its various sub-committees and our supporters.\"\n\nFollowing the attack AbM and the KRDC, democratically elected structures, were removed from the settlement and the provincial government replaced these structures with an unelected ANC affiliated Community Policing Forum.\n\nThe attacks garnered national and international condemnation with some people labelling the events a 'coup'. Churches also issued statements of condemnation.\n\nA number of well known intellectuals, including Noam Chomsky, expressed concern about the attacks and Human Rights Watch, the Centre for the Study of Democracy, The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights and Amnesty International supported the call for an independent commission of inquiry into the attacks. The government ignored this call.\n\nThe Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions in Geneva issued a statement that expressed \"grave concern about reports of organised intimidation and threats to members of advocacy group, Abahlali baseMjondolo.\"\n\nConsiderable concern was expressed about the legal process following the arrests of twelve people after the attacks. Amnesty International has expressed concern and the New York-based Centre for Constitutional Rights sent an urgent appeal to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders to ask her to investigate the case of the attack on Abahlali baseMjondolo and subsequent judicial process.\n\nOn 18 July 2011, the case against the 12 accused members of Abahlali baseMjondolo collapsed. The Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa issued a statement saying that the \"charges were based on evidence which now appears almost certainly to have been manufactured\" and that the Magistrate had described the state witnesses as \"“belligerent”, “unreliable” and “dishonest”. Amnesty International noted that the court had found that \"police had directed some witnesses to point out members of Abahlali-linked organisations at the identification parade\".\n\n\n\n\n\n "}

{"id": "16674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16674", "title": "Kiribati", "text": "Kiribati\n\nKiribati (), officially the Republic of Kiribati (Gilbertese: \"Ribaberiki Kiribati\"), is a sovereign state in Micronesia in the central Pacific Ocean. The permanent population is just over 110,000 (2015), more than half of whom live on Tarawa Atoll. The state comprises 32 atolls and reef islands and one raised coral island, Banaba. They have a total land area of and are dispersed over 3.5 million square kilometres (1.3 million square miles). Their spread straddles both the equator and the 180th meridian, although the International Date Line goes round Kiribati and swings far to the east, almost reaching the 150°W meridian. This brings the Line Islands into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of Hawaii, have the most advanced time on Earth: hours.\n\nKiribati became independent from the United Kingdom in 1979. The capital and now most populated area, South Tarawa, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of causeways. These comprise about half the area of Tarawa Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the IMF and the World Bank, and became a full member of the United Nations in 1999.\n\nThe name \"Kiribati\" was adopted at independence. It is the local enunciation of \"Gilberts\". This name derives from the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named the Gilbert Islands after the British explorer Thomas Gilbert. He sighted many of the islands in 1788 while mapping out the Outer Passage route from Port Jackson to Canton.\n\nThe Kiribati archipelago was named \"Îles Gilbert\" (\"Gilbert Islands\" in English), in about 1820, by Russian admiral Adam von Krusenstern and French captain Louis Duperrey. Both their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the \nWestern Pacific Order in Council of 1877.\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony from 1916, and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of Tuvalu in 1976. The spelling of \"Gilberts\" in the Gilbertese language as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).\n\nIt is often suggested that the indigenous name for the Gilbert Islands proper is \"Tungaru\" (see e.g. Arthur Grimble, 1989). However, the name Kiribati was chosen as the name of the new independent nation by local consensus, on such grounds that it was modern, and to acknowledge the inclusion of islands (e.g. the Phoenix Group and Line Islands), which were never considered part of the Tungaru (or Gilberts) chain.\n\nThe pronunciation differs: \"Kiribas\" is the official pronunciation as \"ti\" in the Gilbertese language makes an \"s\" sound.\n\nThe area now called Kiribati has been inhabited by Micronesians speaking the same Oceanic language since sometime between 3000 BC and AD 1300. The area was not isolated; invaders from Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji, later introduced Polynesian and Melanesian cultural aspects, respectively. Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences and resulted in a significant degree of cultural homogenisation.\n\nChance visits by European ships occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries, as these ships attempted circumnavigations of the world or sought sailing routes from the south to north Pacific Ocean. A passing trade, whaling the On-The-Line grounds and labour trade ships visited the islands in large numbers during the 19th century with social, economic, political, religious and cultural consequences, good, bad and indifferent.\n\nThe passing trade gave rise to European, Chinese, Samoan and other residents from the 1830s: they included beachcombers, castaways, traders and missionaries. In 1892 local authorities (uea, atun te boti) on each of the Gilbert Islands agreed to Captain Davis RN declaring them part of a British protectorate with the nearby Ellice Islands. They were administered by a resident commissioner based in Butaritari (1893–95), Tarawa (1896–1908) and Banaba (1908–1941), who was under the Western Pacific High Commission based in Fiji. Banaba, known to Europeans as Ocean Island, was added to the protectorate in 1900.\nThe conduct of W. Telfer Campbell, the resident commissioner of the Gilberts of 1896 to 1908, was criticised as to his legislative, judicial and administrative management (including allegations of forced labour exacted from islanders) and became the subject of the 1909 report by Arthur Mahaffy. In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the New Age journal described the mis-administration of W. Telfer Campbell and questioned the partiality of Arthur Mahaffy as he was a former colonial official in the Gilberts. The anonymous correspondent also criticised the operations of the Pacific Phosphate Company on Ocean Island.\n\nThe islands became the crown colony of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands in 1916. The Line Islands, including Christmas Island (later spelled Kiritimati) and Fanning Island (Tabuaeran), were added to the colony in 1919 and the Phoenix Islands were added in 1937.\nSir Arthur Grimble was a cadet administrative officer based at Tarawa (1913–1919) and became Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1926.\n\nIn 1902, the Pacific Cable Board laid the first trans-Pacific telegraph cable from Bamfield, British Columbia to Fanning Island (Tabuaeran) in the Line Islands and from Fiji to Fanning Island, thus completing the All Red Line, a series of telegraph lines circumnavigating the globe completely within the British Empire. The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including Palmyra Island were disfavored due to the lack of adequate landing sites.\nThe United States eventually incorporated the Northern Line into its territories and did the same with the Phoenix Islands which lie between Kiribati and the Line Islands including Howland, Jarvis, and Baker islands, thus, bringing about a territorial dispute. This was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati as part of the Treaty of Tarawa. This was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix Islands and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.\nTarawa Atoll and others of the Gilbert group were occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1943 during World War II. Betio became an airfield and supply base. The expulsion of the Japanese military in late 1943 involved one of the bloodiest battles in US Marine Corps history. Marines landed in November 1943 and the Battle of Tarawa ensued.\n\nFurther military operations in the colony occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s when Christmas Island was used by the United States and United Kingdom for nuclear weapons testing including hydrogen bombs.\n\nInstitutions of internal self-rule were established on Tarawa from about 1967. The Ellice Islands were separated from the rest of the colony in 1975 and granted their own internal self-rule institutions. In 1978 the Ellice Islands became the independent nation of Tuvalu.\n\nThe Gilbert Islands gained independence as the Republic of Kiribati on 12 July 1979. The United States gave up most of the Line Islands and recognised Kiribati in 1983. Kiribati received Canton Island, Enderbury Island, Birnie Island, Mckean Island, Rawaki, Manra, Orona, and Nikumaroro from the Phoenix Islands; and Teraina, Tabuaeran, Kiritimati, Malden Island, Starbuck Island, Caroline Islands, Vostok Islands and Flint Island from the Line Islands.\n\nAlthough the indigenous Gilbertese language name for the Gilbert Islands proper is \"Tungaru\", the new state chose the name \"Kiribati\", the I-Kiribati enunciation of \"Gilberts\", as an equivalent of the former colony to acknowledge the inclusion of Banaba, the Line Islands, and the Phoenix Islands. The last two of these were never occupied by I-Kiribati until the British authorities, and later the Republic Government, resettled I-Kiribati there under resettlement schemes.\n\nIn the post-independence era, overcrowding has been a problem, at least in British and aid organisations' eyes. In 1988, an announcement was made that 4,700 residents of the main island group would be resettled onto less-populated islands.\nTeburoro Tito was elected president in 1994. In 1995, Kiribati unilaterally moved the international date line far to the east to encompass the Line Islands group, so that the nation would no longer be divided by the date line. The move, which fulfilled one of President Tito's campaign promises, was intended to allow businesses across the expansive nation to keep the same business week. This also enabled Kiribati to become the first country to see the dawn of the third millennium, an event of significance for tourism. Tito was re-elected in 1998. Kiribati gained UN membership in 1999.\n\nIn 2002, Kiribati passed a controversial law that enabled the government to shut down newspapers. The legislation followed the launching of Kiribati's first successful non-government-run newspaper. President Tito was re-elected in 2003 but was removed from office in March 2003 by a no-confidence vote and replaced by a Council of State. Anote Tong of the opposition party Boutokaan Te Koaua was elected to succeed Tito in July 2003. He was re-elected in 2007 and in 2011.\n\nIn June 2008, Kiribati officials asked Australia and New Zealand to accept Kiribati citizens as permanent refugees. Kiribati is expected to be the first country to lose all its land territory to global warming. In June 2008, the Kiribati President Anote Tong said that the country has reached \"the point of no return.\" He added, \"To plan for the day when you no longer have a country is indeed painful but I think we have to do that.\"\n\nIn early 2012, the government of Kiribati purchased the 2,200-hectare Natoavatu Estate on the second largest island of Fiji, Vanua Levu. At the time it was widely reported that the government planned to evacuate the entire population of Kiribati to Fiji. In April 2013, President Tong began urging citizens to evacuate the islands and migrate elsewhere. In May 2014, the Office of the President confirmed the purchase of some 5,460 acres of land on Vanua Levu at a cost of 9.3 million Australian dollars.\n\nThe Kiribati Constitution, promulgated 12 July 1979, provides for free and open elections. The executive branch consists of a president (\"te Beretitenti\"), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is elected from the legislature and is limited to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral \"Maneaba Ni Maungatabu\" (House of Assembly). It has elected members, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in Fiji (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an \"ex-officio\" member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see Subdivisions of Kiribati).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the \"Boutokaan te Koaua\" Party, \"Maneaban te Mauri\" Party, \"Maurin Kiribati\" Party and \"Tabomoa\" Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of China (Taiwan), Japan and Fiji. The first three of these provide the majority of the country's foreign aid. Taiwan and Japan also have specified-period licences to fish in Kiribati's waters. There are four resident diplomatic missions headquartered in Kiribati: the Embassies of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Cuba and the High Commissions of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn November 1999 Kiribati agreed to allow Japan's National Space Development Agency to lease land on Christmas Island for 20 years, on which to build a spaceport. The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US$840,000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment. A Japanese-built downrange tracking station operates on Kiritimati and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned space shuttle called HOPE-X. HOPE-X, however, was eventually cancelled by Japan in 2003.\n\nAs one of the world's most vulnerable nations to the effects of global warming, Kiribati has been an active participant in international diplomatic efforts relating to climate change, most importantly the UNFCCC conferences of the parties (COP). Kiribati is a member of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries. Established in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the Climate Vulnerable Forum (V11) in the Maldives, with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving carbon neutrality.\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the Tarawa Climate Change Conference (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum. The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to COP16 held in Cancun, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010.\n\nIn 2013, President Tong has spoken of climate-change induced sea level rise as \"inevitable\". \"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate. Either we can wait for the time when we have to move people en masse or we can prepare them—beginning from now ...\" In New York in 2014, per \"The New Yorker\", President Tong told \"The New York Times\" that \"according to the projections, within this century, the water will be higher than the highest point in our lands\". In 2014, President Tong finalized the purchase of a 20 km stretch of land on Vanua Levu, one of the larger Fiji islands, 2,000 km away. A move described by Tong as an \"absolute necessity\" should the nation be completely submerged under water.\n\nIn 2013 attention was drawn to a claim of a Kiribati man of being a \"climate change refugee\" under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951). However this claim was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable. The New Zealand Court of Appeal also rejected the claim in a 2014 decision. On further appeal the New Zealand Supreme Court confirmed the earlier adverse rulings against the application for refugee status, but rejected the proposition “that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could never create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.”\n\nLaw enforcement in Kiribati is carried out by the Kiribati Police Service which is responsible for all law enforcement and paramilitary duties for the island nation. There are police posts located on all of the islands. The police have one patrol boat. Kiribati has no military and relies on both Australia and New Zealand for its defence.\n\nThe main prison in Kiribati is located in Betio, named the Walter Betio Prison. There is also a prison in Ronton (London) on Kiritimati Island.\n\nThere are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Kiribati is divided geographically into three island groups, including a group that unites the Line Islands and the Phoenix Islands (ministry at London, Kiritimati Island). The groups have no administrative function. They are:\n\nThe original districts before independence were:\n\nFour of the former districts (including Tarawa) lie in the Gilbert Islands, where most of the country's population lives. Five of the Line Islands are uninhabited (Malden Island, Starbuck Island, Caroline Island, Vostok Island and Flint Island). The Phoenix Islands are uninhabited except for Kanton, and have no representation. Banaba itself is sparsely inhabited now. There is also a non-elected representative of the Banabans on Rabi Island in Fiji.\n\nEach of the 21 inhabited islands has its own local council that takes care of daily affairs. There is one council for each inhabited island, with two exceptions: Tarawa Atoll has three councils: Betio Town Council, Te Inainano Urban Council (for the rest of South Tarawa) and Eutan Tarawa Council (for North Tarawa); and Tabiteuea has two councils.\n\nKiribati consists of 32 atolls and one solitary island (Banaba), extending into the eastern and western hemispheres, as well as the northern and southern hemispheres. It is the only country that is situated within all four hemispheres. The groups of islands are:\n\nBanaba (or Ocean Island) is a raised-coral island. It was once a rich source of phosphates, but was exhausted in mining before independence. The rest of the land in Kiribati consists of the sand and reef rock islets of atolls or coral islands, which rise only one or two metres above sea level.\n\nThe soil is thin and calcareous. It has a low water-holding capacity and low organic matter and nutrient content—except for calcium, sodium, and magnesium. Banaba is one of the least suitable places for agriculture in the world.\n\nKiritimati (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands is the world's largest atoll. Based on a 1995 realignment of the International Date Line, the Line Islands were the first area to enter into a new year, including year 2000. For that reason, Caroline Island has been renamed Millennium Island. The majority of Kiribati, including the capital, is not first, for example New Zealand (UTC+13 in January) has an earlier new year.\n\nAccording to the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (previously South Pacific Regional Environment Programme), two small uninhabited Kiribati islets, Tebua Tarawa and Abanuea, disappeared underwater in 1999. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by about 50 cm (20 in) by 2100 due to global warming and a further rise would be inevitable. It is thus likely that within a century the nation's arable land will become subject to increased soil salination and will be largely submerged.\n\nThe exposure of Kiribati to changes in sea levels is exacerbated by the Pacific decadal oscillation, which is a climate switch phenomenon that results in changes from periods of La Niña to periods of El Niño. This has an effect on sea levels. For example, in 2000 there was a switch from periods of downward pressure of El Niño on sea levels to an upward pressure of La Niña on sea levels, which upward pressure causes more frequent and higher high tide levels. The Perigean spring tide (often called a king tide) can result in seawater flooding low-lying areas of the islands of Kiribati.\n\nThe atolls and reef islands can respond to changes in sea-level. Paul Kench at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and Arthur Webb at the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission in Fiji released a study in 2010 on the dynamic response of atolls and reef islands in the central Pacific. Kiribati was mentioned in the study, and Webb and Kench found that the three major urbanised islands in Kiribati—Betio, Bairiki and Nanikai—increased by 30% (36 hectares), 16.3% (5.8 hectares) and 12.5% (0.8 hectares), respectively.\n\nThe study by Paul Kench and Arthur Webb recognises that the islands are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise, and concluded that: \"This study did not measure vertical growth of the island surface nor does it suggest there is any change in the height of the islands. Since land height has not changed the vulnerability of the greater part of the land area of each island to submergence due to sea level rise is also unchanged and these low-lying atolls remain immediately and extremely vulnerable to inundation or sea water flooding.\"\n\nThe Climate Change in the Pacific Report of 2011 describes Kiribati as having a low risk of cyclones; however in March 2015 Kiribati experienced flooding and destruction of seawalls and coastal infrastructure as the result of Cyclone Pam, a Category 5 cyclone that devastated Vanuatu. Kiribati remains exposed to the risk that cyclones can strip the low-lying islands of their vegetation and soil.\n\nGradual sea-level rise also allows for coral polyp activity to raise the atolls with the sea level. However, if the increase in sea level occurs at a rate faster than coral growth, or if polyp activity is damaged by ocean acidification, then the resilience of the atolls and reef islands is less certain. Also, coral bleaching has led to the death of up to 80% of the coral.\n\nThe Kiribati Adaptation Program (KAP), started in 2003, is a US $5.5 million initiative that was originally enacted by the national government of Kiribati with the support of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Japanese government. Australia later joined the coalition, donating US $1.5 million to the effort. The program aims to take place over six years, supporting measures that reduce Kiribati's vulnerability to the effects of climate change and sea level rise by raising awareness of climate change, assessing and protecting available water resources, and managing inundation. At the start of the Adaptation Program, representatives from each of the inhabited atolls identified key climatic changes that had taken place over the past 20–40 years and proposed coping mechanisms to deal with these changes under four categories of urgency of need. The program is now focusing on the country's most vulnerable sectors in the most highly populated areas. Initiatives include improving water supply management in and around Tarawa; coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re-plantation and protection of public infrastructure; strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion; and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks.\n\nThe climate is pleasant from April to October, with predominant northeastern winds and stable temperatures close to . From November to March, western gales bring rain and occasional cyclones.\n\nPrecipitation varies significantly between islands. For example, the annual average is 3,000 mm (120 in) in the north and 500 mm (20 in) in the south of the Gilbert Islands. Most of these islands are in the dry belt of the equatorial oceanic climatic zone and experience prolonged droughts.\n\nBecause of the young geological age of the islands and atolls and high level of soil salination the flora of Kiribati is relatively poor. It contains about 83 indigenous and 306 introduced plants on Gilbert Islands, whereas the corresponding numbers for Line and Phoenix Islands are 67 and 283. None of these species are endemic, and about half of the indigenous ones have a limited distribution and became endangered or nearly extinct due to human activities such as phosphate mining. Coconut and pandanus palms and breadfruit trees are most common wild plants, whereas the five most cultivated crops are Chinese cabbage, pumpkin, tomato, watermelon and cucumber. Over eighty percent of the population participates in either farming or fishing.\nSeaweed farming is an important part of the economy , with two major species \"Eucheuma alcarezii\" and \"Eucheuma spinosium\" introduced to the local lagoons from the Philippines in 1977. It competes with collection of the black-lipped pearl oyster (\"Pinctada margaritifera\") and shellfish, which are dominated by the strombid gastropod (\"Strombus luhuanus\") and Anadara cockles (\"Anadara uropigimelana\"), whereas the stocks of the giant clam (\"Tridacna gigas\") have been largely exhausted.\n\nKiribati has a few land mammals, none being indigenous or endemic. They include the Polynesian rat (\"Rattus exulans\"), dogs and pigs. Among the 75 bird species, the Bokikokiko (\"Acrocephalus aequinoctialis\") is endemic to Kiritimati.\n\nThere are 600–800 species of inshore and pelagic finfish, some 200 species of corals and about 1000 species of shellfish. Fishing mostly targets the family Scombridae, particularly the skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna as well as flying fish (\"Cypselurus\" spp.).\nDogs introduced by European settlers have continued to grow in numbers and are roaming in traditional packs, particularly around South Tarawa.\n\nKiribati has few natural resources. Commercially viable phosphate deposits on Banaba were exhausted at the time of independence. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati is considered one of the least developed countries in the world.\n\nIn one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker remittances, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production ability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for financing.\n\nThe economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs. The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the European Union (A$9 million), the United Nations Development Programme (A$3.7 million), UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (A$100,000). The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia (A$11 million), Japan (A$2 million), New Zealand (A$6.6 million), Taiwan (A$10.6 million), and other donors providing A$16.2 million, including technical assistance grants from the Asian Development Bank.\n\nThe major donors in 2010/2011 were Australia (A$15 million), Taiwan (A$11 million); New Zealand (A$6 million), the World Bank (A$4 million) and the Asian Development Bank.\n\nIn 1956, Kiribati established a sovereign wealth fund to act as a store of wealth for the country's earnings from phosphate mining.\nIn 2008, the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund was valued at US$400 million. The RERF assets declined from A$637 million (420% of GDP) in 2007 to A$570.5 million (350% of GDP) in 2009 as the result of the global financial crisis and exposure to failed Icelandic banks. In addition, draw downs were made by the government of Kiribati to finance budgetary shortfalls during this period.\n\nIn May 2011, the IMF country report assessment of the economy of Kiribati is that “After two years of contraction, the economy recovered in the second half of 2010 and inflation pressure dissipated. It is estimated to have grown by 1.75% for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base. Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled. But it started to pick up in the second half of 2010 as the recovery gained traction.”\n\nA major Australian bank, ANZ, maintains a presence on Kiribati with a number of branches and ATM units.\n\nBeginning in January 2009, Kiribati has two domestic airlines: Air Kiribati and Coral Sun Airways. Both airlines are based in Tarawa's Bonriki International Airport and serve destinations across the Gilbert Islands only.\n\nNeither the Phoenix nor Line Islands are served by the domestic carriers. The only served airport by any airline is Cassidy International Airport on Kiritimati. Fiji's national carrier Fiji Airways provides an international service from Fiji's main airport, Nadi International Airport to Cassidy Airport as well as to Bonriki Airport.\n\nThe November 2015 census showed a population of 110,136. About 90% of that population lived in the Gilbert Islands, with about 40% of them on South Tarawa. If nearby Betio is included with South Tarawa, the percentage rises to more than 50%.\n\nUntil recently, the people of Kiribati mostly lived in villages with populations between 50 and 3,000 on the outer islands. Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation has raised the population of South Tarawa to 50,182.\nThe native people of Kiribati are called I-Kiribati. Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are Micronesians. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that Austronesians originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing Polynesian linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.\n\nThe people of Kiribati speak an Oceanic language called Gilbertese. Although English is also an official language, it is not used very often outside the island capital of Tarawa. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language. Several words in Gilbertese have been adopted from European settlers, for instance, \"kamea\" is the Gilbertese word for dog, which has its origins in the I-Kiribati people hearing the European settlers saying \"come here\" to their dogs, and adopting that as \"kamea\".\n\nChristianity is the major religion in Kiribati, having been introduced by missionaries in the 19th century. The population is predominantly Roman Catholic (56%), although a substantial portion of the population belongs to the Kiribati Uniting Church (34%). Many other Protestant denominations, including evangelical churches, are also represented. The Bahá'í Faith religion also exists in Kiribati (2.2%), along with Jehovah's Witnesses.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints self-reports a membership of 19,690 (16.7%) with 30 congregations at the end of 2018.\n\nThe Kiribati Uniting Church and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints maintain large physical presences in Kiribati; both churches have a large number of church buildings, predominantly in Betio and Bonriki.\n\nThe population of Kiribati has a life expectancy at birth of 60 years (57 for males, and 63 for females) and an infant mortality rate of 54 deaths per 1,000 live births. Tuberculosis has a small presence in the country, with 365 cases of 100,000 a year. Government expenditure on health was at US$268 per capita (PPP) in 2006. In 1990–2007, there were 23 physicians per 100,000 persons. Since the arrival of Cuban doctors, the infant mortality rate has decreased significantly.\n\nMost health problems are related to consumption of semi-raw seafood, limited amount of food storage facilities, and bacterial contamination of fresh water supplies. In the early 2000s, between 1 and 7% of the population, depending on the island, were annually treated for food poisoning in a hospital. Modernization and cross-cultural exchange of the late 20th century brought new issues of unhealthy diet and lifestyle; heavy smoking, especially among the young population; and external infections, including HIV/AIDS.\n\nKiribati is the country with the third highest prevalence of smoking, with 54% of the population reported as smokers.\n\nFresh water remains a concern of Kiribati – during the dry season (Aumaiaki), water has been drilled for instead of using rain water tanks. In recent years, there has been a longer than usual Aumaikai season resulting in additional water having to be drilled from beneath the water table. This has introduced water-borne illnesses, compounding the health problems within Kiribati.\n\nPrimary education is free and compulsory for the first six years, now being extended to nine years. Mission schools are slowly being absorbed into the government primary school system. Higher education is expanding; students may seek technical, teacher or marine training, or study in other countries. To date, most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji to attend University of South Pacific, and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba.\n\nKiribati Ministry of Education is the education ministry. The government high schools are King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School, Tabiteuea North Senior Secondary School, and Melaengi Tabai Secondary School. 13 high schools are operated by Christian churches.\n\nUniversity of South Pacific has a campus in Kiribati for distant/flexible learning, but also to provide preparatory studies towards obtaining certificates, diplomas and degrees at other campus sites.\n\nThe other prominent school in Kiribati is the Kiribati Institute of Technology.\n\nSongs (\"te anene\") and above all, dances (\"te mwaie\"), are held in high regard.\n\nKiribati folk music is generally based on chanting or other forms of vocalising, accompanied by body percussion. Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (\"Te Kaimatoa\") or the hip dance (\"Te Buki\"), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also stick dances which accompany legends and semi-historical stories . These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The Frigate bird (\"Fregata minor\") on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.\n\nKiribati has competed at the Commonwealth Games since 1998 and the Summer Olympics since 2004. It sent three competitors to its first Olympics, two sprinters and a weightlifter. Kiribati won its first ever Commonwealth Games medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games when weightlifter David Katoatau won Gold in the 105 kg Group.\n\nThe Kiribati national football team is an associate member of the Oceania Football Confederation, but not of world-governing body FIFA. It has played ten matches, all of which it has lost, and all at the Pacific Games from 1979 to 2011. The Kiribati football stadium is Bairiki National Stadium, which has a capacity of only 2500.\n\nThe Betio Soccer Field is home to a number of local sporting teams.\n\nEdward Carlyon Eliot, who was Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert & Ellice Islands (now Kiribati & Tuvalu) from 1913 to 1920 describes this period in his book \"Broken Atoms\" (autobiographical reminiscences) Pub. G. Bles, London, 1938.\n\nSir Arthur Grimble wrote about his time working in the British colonial service in Kiribati (then the Gilbert Islands) from 1914 to 1932 in two popular books \"A Pattern of Islands\" (1952) and \"Return to the Islands\" (1957). He also undertook academic studies of Gilbertese culture.\n\nJ. Maarten Troost's more recent autobiographical experiences on the Tarawa Atoll are documented in his book \"The Sex Lives of Cannibals\" (2004).\n\n\n"}

Such intervention can include both military invasion and humanitarian aid. This view is contrasted to isolationist, realist, or non-interventionist foreign policy doctrines; these critics characterize it as liberal interventionism. \n\nLiberal Internationalism emerged during the nineteenth century, notably under the auspices of British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, and was developed in the second decade of the 20th century under U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. In this form it became known as Wilsonianism.\n\nThe goal of liberal internationalism is to achieve global structures within the international system that are inclined towards promoting a liberal world order. To that extent, global free trade, liberal economics and liberal political systems are all encouraged. In addition, liberal internationalists are dedicated towards encouraging democracy to emerge globally. Once realized, it will result in a 'peace dividend', as liberal states have relations that are characterized by non-violence, and that relations between democracies is characterized by the democratic peace theory.\n\nLiberal internationalism states that, through multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, it is possible to avoid the worst excesses of \"power politics\" in relations between nations.\n\nExamples of liberal internationalists include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the US, it is often associated with the American Democratic Party; however, many neo-conservative thinkers in the United States have begun using similar arguments as liberal internationalists and, to the extent that the two ideologies have become more similar, it may show liberal internationalist thinking is spreading within the Republican Party. Others argue that neoconservatism and liberal internationalism are distinctly different foreign policy philosophies and neoconservatives may only employ rhetoric similar to a liberal internationalist but with far different goals and methods of foreign policy intervention.\n\nCommonly cited examples of liberal interventionism in action include NATO's intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina; their 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia; British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War; and the 2011 military intervention in Libya.\n\n"}

The law is expected to ensure that Ghana’s natural resources benefit Ghanaians, while also allowing foreign oil companies to reap fair returns on their investment.\n\nThe bill – Legislative Instrument (LI) 2204 – seeks to “promote the maximisation of value-addition and job creation through the use of local expertise, goods and services, business and financing in the petroleum industry value chain and their retention in the country; develop local capacities in the petroleum industry value chain through education, skills transfer and expertise development, transfer of technology and know-how and active research and development programmes; achieve the minimum local employment level and in-country spend for the provision of the goods and services in the petroleum industry value chain; increase the capability and international competitiveness of domestic businesses; and achieve and attain a degree of control for Ghanaians over development initiatives for local stakeholders”.\n\nThe law also requires that a “contractor, sub-contractor, licensee, the corporation or other allied entity carrying out a petroleum activity shall ensure that local content is a component of the petroleum activities engaged in by that contractor, sub-contractor and licensee, the corporation or allied entity”; and that “an indigenous Ghanaian company shall be given first preference in the grant of a petroleum agreement or a licence with respect to petroleum activities subject to the fulfilment of the conditions specified in the regulations”.\n\nThe bill also requires that “there shall be at least a five percent equity participation of an indigenous Ghanaian company other than the corporation to be qualified to enter into petroleum agreement or a petroleum licence”.\n\nThe law marks one of the first steps that an African country has taken in taking control of its own natural resources from an industry usually dominated by foreign companies. Despite this, international oil firms have broadly endorsed the bill as it fits in with many of their respective corporate social responsibility schemes. Ghana’s Parliament hailed the bill as the country’s “best hope of effectively integrating the sector into the rest of the national economy”.\n"}

It operates pay television channels directed to audiences outside of Russia, as well as providing Internet content in English, Spanish, French, German, Arabic and Russian.\n\nRT International, based in Moscow, presents around-the-clock news bulletins, documentaries, talk shows, debates, sports news, and cultural programmes that it says provide \"a Russian viewpoint on major global events\". RT operates as a multilingual service with conventional channels in five languages: the original English-language channel was launched in 2005, the Arabic-language channel in 2007, Spanish in 2009, German in 2014 and French in 2017. RT America (since 2010), RT UK (since 2014), and other regional channels also offer some locally-based content.\n\nRT is a brand of \"TV-Novosti\", an \"autonomous non-profit organization\", founded by the Russian news agency, RIA Novosti, on 6 April 2005. During the economic crisis in December 2008, the Russian government, headed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, included ANO \"TV-Novosti\" on its list of core organizations of strategic importance of Russia.\n\nRT has been frequently described as a propaganda outlet for the Russian government and its foreign policy. RT has also been accused of spreading disinformation by news reporters, including some former RT reporters. The United Kingdom media regulator, Ofcom, has repeatedly found RT to have breached its rules on impartiality and of broadcasting \"materially misleading\" content. In September 2017, RT America was ordered to register as a \"foreign agent\" with the United States Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Under the act, RT will be required to disclose financial information.\n\nThe creation of RT was a part of a larger public relations effort by the Russian Government in 2005 that was intended to improve the image of Russia abroad. RT was conceived by former media minister Mikhail Lesin, and Russian president Vladimir Putin's press spokesperson Aleksei Gromov. At the time of RT's founding, RIA Novosti director Svetlana Mironyuk stated: \"Unfortunately, at the level of mass consciousness in the West, Russia is associated with three words: communism, snow and poverty,\" and added \"we would like to present a more complete picture of life in our country.\" It is registered as an autonomous nonprofit organization funded by the federal budget of Russia through the Federal Agency on Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation.\n\nIn 2005, RIA Novosti helped establish ANO TV-Novosti (or \"Autonomous Non-profit Organization TV-News\") to serve as the parent organization for the planned channel. ANO TV-Novosti was registered on 6 April 2005. ANO TV-Novosti appointed Sergey Frolov as its CEO position;\nThe channel was launched as Russia Today on 10 December 2005. At its launch, the channel employed 300 journalists, including approximately 70 from outside Russia. Russia Today appointed Margarita Simonyan as its editor-in-chief, who recruited foreign journalists as presenters and consultants. Simonyan stated that the channel's intent was to have a \"professional format\" akin to the BBC and Euronews that would \"reflect Russia's opinion of the world\" and present a \"more balanced picture\" of Russia.\n\nSimonyan, who was only 25 years old at the time of her hiring by the channel, was a former Kremlin pool reporter and had worked in journalism since she was 18. She told \"The New York Times\" that after the fall of the Soviet Union, many new young journalists were hired, resulting in a much younger pool of staffers than other news organizations. Journalist Danny Schechter (who has appeared as a guest on RT) has stated that having been part of the launch staff at CNN, he saw RT as another \"channel of young people who are inexperienced, but very enthusiastic about what they are doing.\" Shortly after the channel was launched, James Painter wrote that RT and similar news channels such as France 24 and TeleSUR saw themselves as \"counter-hegemonic\", offering a differing vision and news content from that of Western media like the CNN and the BBC.\n\nRT launched several new channels in ensuing years: the Arabic language channel Rusiya Al-Yaum in 2007, the Spanish language channel RT Actualidad in 2009, RT America – which focuses on the United States – in 2010, and the RT Documentary channel in 2011.\n\nIn August 2007, Russia Today became the first television channel to report live from the North Pole (with the report lasting five minutes and 41 seconds). An RT crew participated in the Arktika 2007 Russian polar expedition, led by Artur Chilingarov on the \"Akademik Fyodorov\" icebreaker. On 31 December 2007, RT's broadcasts of New Year's Eve celebrations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg were broadcast in the hours prior to the New Year's Eve event at New York City's Times Square.\n\nRT drew particular attention worldwide for its coverage of the 2008 South Ossetia war. RT named Georgia as the aggressor against the separatist governments of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which were protected by Russian troops. RT saw this as the incident that showcased its newsgathering abilities to the world. Margarita Simonyan stated, \"we were the only ones among the English-language media who were giving the other side of the story – the South Ossetian side of the story.\"\n\nIn 2009, Russia Today rebranded itself to simply the \"RT\" initials. Simonyan denied that the name change was an attempt to hide its Russian origins, stating the corporate logo was changed to attract more viewers and commenting, \"who is interested in watching news from Russia all day long?\"\n\nIn early 2010, RT unveiled a highly controversial advertising campaign called \"Question More\", which was created for the channel by Britain-based McCann Erickson. One of the advertisements featured as part of the campaign showed President of the United States Barack Obama \"morphing\" into Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and asked: \"Who poses the greatest nuclear threat?\" The ad was banned in American airports. Another showed a Western soldier \"merging\" into a Taliban fighter and asks: \"Is terror only inflicted by terrorists?\" One of RT's 2010 billboard advertisements won the British Awards for National Newspaper Advertising \"Ad of the Month\".\n\nRT is one of several international channels to challenge the United States media's global news coverage. In 2010 Walter Isaacson, Chairman of the U.S. Government's Broadcasting Board of Governors (which runs Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia), called for more money to invest into the programs because, \"We can't allow ourselves to be out-communicated by our enemies,\" mentioning specifically Russia Today, Iran's Press TV and China's China Central Television (CCTV) in the next sentence. He later explained he actually was referring to \"enemies\" in Afghanistan, not the nations he mentioned. In 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the United States was \"losing the information war\" abroad to foreign channels like RT, Al Jazeera and China Central Television and that they are supplanting the Voice of America.\n\nIn early 2012, shortly after his appointment as the United States Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul challenged Margarita Simonyan on Twitter, regarding allegations from RT that he sent Alexei Navalny to study at Yale University. According to RT, McFaul was referring to a comment in an article by political scientist Igor Panarin, which RT had specified were the views of the author. McFaul then accepted an interview by Sophie Shevardnadze on RT on this and other issues and reasserted that the Obama administration wanted a \"reset\" in relations with Russia.\nOn 17 April 2012, RT debuted \"World Tomorrow\", a news interview programme hosted by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The first guest on the program was Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The interview made global headlines as Nasrallah rarely gives interviews to Western media. Commentators described this as a \"coup\" or a \"scoop\". WikiLeaks described the show as \"a series of in-depth conversations with key political players, thinkers and revolutionaries from around the world.\" It stated that the show is \"independently produced and Assange has control\"; WikiLeaks offers a \"Broadcasters license, only\".\n\nAssange said that RT would allow his guests to discuss things that they \"could not say on a mainstream TV network.\" Assange said that if Wikileaks had published Russian data, his relationship with RT might not have been so comfortable. In August of that year, RT suffered a denial of service attack for several days by a group calling itself \"Antileaks\". It was speculated that the group was protesting Assange and/or Russia's jailing of members of the activist music group Pussy Riot.\n\nOn 23 October 2012, RT, along with Al Jazeera and C-SPAN, broadcast the Free and Equal Elections Foundation third-party debate among four third-party candidates for President of the United States. On 5 November, RT broadcast the two candidates that were voted winners of that debate, Libertarian Party candidate Governor Gary Johnson and the Green Party of the United States candidate Jill Stein from RT's Washington, D.C. studio.\n\nIn November 2012, Israeli Defense Force bombs severely damaged RT's offices in Gaza City, wounding four journalists, during Operation Pillar of Defense. The office was right next to that of the Israeli target, Al-Aqsa TV, a television station that was affiliated with the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nIn May 2013, RT announced that former CNN host Larry King would host a new talk show on RT. King said in an advertisement on RT: \"I would rather ask questions to people in positions of power, instead of speaking on their behalf.\" As part of the deal, King would also bring his Hulu series \"Larry King Now\" to RT. On 13 June 2013, RT aired a preview telecast of King's new Thursday evening program \"Politicking\", with the episode discussing Edward Snowden's leaking of the PRISM surveillance program.\nVladimir Putin visited the new RT broadcasting centre in June 2013 and stated \"When we designed this project back in 2005 we intended introducing another strong player on the international scene, a player that wouldn't just provide an unbiased coverage of the events in Russia but also try, let me stress, I mean – try to break the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on the global information streams. ... We wanted to bring an absolutely independent news channel to the news arena. Certainly the channel is funded by the government, so it cannot help but reflect the Russian government's official position on the events in our country and in the rest of the world one way or another. But I’d like to underline again that we never intended this channel, RT, as any kind of apologetics for the Russian political line, whether domestic or foreign.\"\n\nIn early October 2014, RT announced the launch of a dedicated news channel, RT UK, aimed at British audiences. The new channel began operating on 30 October 2014.\n\nIn 2018 some of the RT staff started a new media project Redfish.media that positions itself as \"grassroots journalism\". The website has been criticized by an activist Musa Okwonga for deceptively taking an interview from him and then distributing it across RT channels while hiding its real affiliation. Another similar project is In the NOW started in 2018.\n\nState-owned RIA Novosti news agency, which founded RT in 2005, is one of the largest in Russia. Its chairperson is Svetlana Mironyuk, who has modernised the agency since her appointment in 2003. RIA Novosti has stated it helped establish RT, but is \"neither a sponsor nor a backer of Russia Today.\" Mikhail Seslavinsky, in charge of the Federal Agency on Press and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation asserted in 2005 that \"Russia Today will come as an independent company\". Under Russian law RT is an independent organisation.\n\nIn 2007, RT established offices in the same building as RIA Novosti, after the Russian Union of Journalists was forced to vacate them. In 2012 Anna Kachkayeva, Dean of Media Communications at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, stated that they \"share the same roof\" because the two organizations are located in the same building, but regarding \"funding, editorial policy, management and staff, they are two independent organisations whose daily operations are not interconnected in any way.\" In 2008, Simonyan noted that more than 50 young RT journalists had gone on to take positions in large Western media outlets. By 2010, RT had grown to a staff of 2,000.\nIn December 2012, RT moved its production studios and headquarters to a new facility in Moscow. The move coincided with RT's upgrade of all of its English-language news programming to high-definition.\n\nIn 2013, a presidential decree issued by Vladimir Putin dissolved RIA Novosti and subsumed it into a new information agency called Rossiya Segodnya (directly translated as \"Russia Today\"). According to a report on the RT website, the new news agency is \"in no way related\" to the news channel RT despite the similarity to RT's original name. However, on 31 December 2013, Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the RT news channel, was also appointed as editor-in-chief of the new news agency while maintaining her duties for the television network.\n\nRT cooperates with a number of media sources in Russia and abroad, including private media like Izvestia, Kommersant, Trud, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Vedomosti, Argumenty i Fakty and the non-Russian Association for International Broadcasting, Huffington Post and News.com.au.\n\nWhen it was established in 2005, ANO TV-Novosti invested $30 million in start-up costs to establish RT, with a budget of $30 million for its first year of operation. Half of the network's budget came from the Russian government; the other half came from pro-Kremlin commercial banks at the government's request. Its annual budget increased from approximately $80 million in 2007 to $380 million in 2011, but was reduced to $300 million in 2012. Russian President Vladimir Putin prohibited the reduction of funding for RT on 30 October 2012.\n\nAbout 80 percent of RT's costs are incurred outside Russia, paying partner networks around $260 million for the distribution of its channels in 2014. In 2014 RT received 11.87 billion rubles ($310 million) in government funding that year and was expected to receive 15.38 billion rubles ($400 million) in 2015. (For comparison the bigger BBC World Service Group had a $376 million budget in 2014-15.) However at the start in 2015, as the ruble's value plummeted and a ten percent reduction in media subsidies was imposed, it was thought that RT's budget for the year would fall to about $236 million. During the year, government funding was increased to 20.8 billion roubles (around $300 million in September). In 2015, RT was expected to receive 19 billion rubles ($307 million) from the Russian government in 2016.\n\nAccording to RT, the network's feed is carried by 22 satellites and over 230 operators, which provides a distribution reach to about 700 million households in more than 100 countries, and that RT America is available to 85 million households throughout the United States.\n\nIn addition to its main English language channel RT International, RT UK and RT America, RT also runs Arabic language channel Rusiya Al-Yaum, Spanish-language channel Actualidad RT, as well as the documentary channel RTDoc. RT maintains 21 bureaus in 16 countries, including those in Washington, D.C., New York City, London, England; Paris, France; Delhi, India; Cairo, Egypt; Baghdad, Iraq; and Kiev, Ukraine. It employs over 2,000 media professionals worldwide.\n\nThe sharp decline in the ruble at the end of 2014, forced it to postpone channels in German and French.\n\nAs well as the news agency Ruptly, RT also operates the following websites: \"RT на русском\" (in Russian), \"RT en français\" (French), \"RT Deutsch\" (German).\n\nIn 2015 RT's YouTube news channels were: RT (the main channel), RT America, RT Arabic, RT en Español, RT Deutsch, RT French, RT UK, RT на русском and the newly launched \nRT Chinese.\n\nIn September 2012, RT signed a contract with Israeli-based RRSat to distribute high definition feeds of the channel in the United States, Latin America and Asia. In October 2012, RT's Rusiya Al-Yaum and RT joined the high definition network Al Yah Satellite Communications (\"YahLive\"). On 12 July 2014, during his visit to Argentina, Putin announced that Actualidad RT will broadcast on free-to-air in the South American country, making it the first foreign television channel to be broadcast free-to-air there. However, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Argentina's State Media Authorities decided to suspend RT on 11 June 2016, along with the Venezuelan television channel TeleSur that had been authorized by the previous left-leaning government of Cristina Kirchner. Officially, Argentina wants to devote RT's frequency spot to domestic broadcasts. RT was made available on the dominant Australian subscription television platform Foxtel on 17 February 2015.\n\nReliable figures for RT's worldwide audience are not available. In the United States, RT typically pays cable and satellite services to carry its channel in subscriber packages. In 2011, RT was the second most-watched foreign news channel in the United States (after BBC World News), and the number one foreign network in five major U.S. urban areas in 2012. It also rates well among younger Americans under 35 and among inner city areas.\n\nIn the UK the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB) has included RT in the viewer data it publishes since 2012. According to their data approximately 2.5 million Britons watched RT during the third quarter of 2012, making it the third most-watched rolling news channel in Britain, behind BBC News and Sky News (not including Sky Sports News). However RT was soon overtaken by Al Jazeera English, and viewing figures had dropped to about 2.1 million by the end of 2013. For comparison it has marginally fewer viewers than S4C, the state-funded Welsh language broadcaster, or minor channels such as Zing, Viva and Rishtey. According to internal documents submitted for Kremlin review, RT's viewership amounts to less than 0.1 percent of Europe's television audience, except in Britain, where 2013 viewership was estimated at approximately 120,000 persons per day. According to the leaked documents, RT was ranked 175th out of 278 channels in Great Britain in May 2013, or in fifth place out of eight cable news channels. In August 2015, RT's average weekly viewing figure had fallen to around 450,000 (0.8 percent of the total UK audience), 100,000 fewer than in June 2012 and less than half that of Al Jazeera English. In March 2016 the monthly viewing was figure 0.04%.\n\nLatin America is the second most significant area of influence for internet RT (rt.com). In 2013, RT ascended to the ranks of the 100 most watched websites in seven Latin American countries.\n\nA Pew Research survey of the most popular news videos on YouTube in 2011-12, found RT to be the top source with 8.5 percent of posts. However of these, 68 percent consisted of first-person video accounts of dramatic worldwide events, likely acquired by the network rather than created by it. In 2013, RT became the first television news channel to reach 1 billion views on YouTube. In 2014 its main (English) channel was reported have 1.4 million subscribers.\n\nIn 2015 \"The Daily Beast\" reported that RT hugely exaggerated its global viewership and that its most-watched segments were on apolitical subjects. Between 2013 and 2015, more than 80% of RT's viewership was for videos of accidents, crime, disasters, and natural phenomena, such as the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor event, with less than 1% of viewership for political videos. In late 2015, all of the 20 most watched videos on its main channel, totaling 300 million views were described as \"disaster/novelty\". Of the top 100, only small number could be categorized as political with only one covering Ukraine. The most popular video of Russian president Putin shows him singing \"Blueberry Hill\" at a 2010 St. Petersburg charity event. In 2017, \"The Washington Post\" analysed RT's popularity and concluded that \"it’s not very good at its job\" as \"Moscow’s propaganda arm\" due to its relative unpopularity. RT has disputed both \"The Daily Beast\" 's and \"The Washington Post\" 's assessments and has said that their analyses used outdated viewership data.\nA study involving Professor Robert Orttung at George Washington University states that RT uses human interest stories without ideological content to attract viewers to its channels. Also between January and May 2015, the Russian-language channel actually had the most viewers, with approximately double the number of the main channel, despite only having around one third the number of subscribers.\n\nIn 2008, Heidi Brown wrote in \"Forbes\" that \"the Kremlin is using charm, good photography and a healthy dose of sex appeal to appeal to a diverse, skeptical audience. The result is entertaining – and ineffably Russian.\" She added that Russia Today has managed to \"get foreigners to at least consider the Russian viewpoint – however eccentric it may be...\"\n\n\"The Alyona Show\", hosted by Alyona Minkovski, ran from 2009 to 2012 (when Minkovski left RT to join \"The Huffington Post\"). \"Daily Beast\" writer Tracy Quan described \"The Alyona Show\" as \"one of RT's most popular vehicles\". \"The New Republic\" columnist Jesse Zwick wrote that one journalist told him that Minkovski is \"probably the best interviewer on cable news.\" Benjamin R. Freed wrote in the avant-garde culture magazine \"SOMA\" that \"The Alyona Show does political talk with razor-sharp wit.\" David Weigel called the show \"an in-house attempt at a newsy cult hit\" and noted that \"her meatiest segments were about government spying, and the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars\". Minkovski had complained about being characterized as if she was \"Putin's girl in Washington\" or as being \"anti-American\". After Minkovski argued that Glenn Beck was \"not on the side of America. And the fact that my channel is more honest with the American people is something you should be ashamed of.\", \"Columbia Journalism Review\" writer Julia Ioffe asked \"since when does Russia Today defend the policies of any American president? Or the informational needs of the American public, for that matter?\"\n\nFrom April to August 2011, RT ran a half-hour primetime show \"Adam vs. the Man\", hosted by former Iraq War Marine veteran and high-profile anti-war activist Adam Kokesh. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's \"propaganda\" function, saying \"We're putting out the truth that no one else wants to say. I mean, if you want to put it in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit.\" The conservative media watchdog Accuracy in Media criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.\n\nReviewing Julian Assange's show \"World Tomorrow\", \"The Independent\" noted that Assange, who was under house arrest, was \"largely deferential\" in asking some questions of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who himself was in hiding. However, he also asked tough questions such as why Nasrallah had not supported Arab revolts against Syrian leaders, when he had supported them in Tunisia, Yemen, Egypt, and other countries. \"The New York Times\" journalist Allesandra Stanley wrote that \"practically speaking, Mr. Assange is in bed with the Kremlin, but on Tuesday's show he didn't put out\" and that he \"behaved surprisingly like a standard network interviewer.\" Douglas Lucas in Salon wrote that the RT deal \"may just be a profitable way for him to get a gigantic retweet.\" Glenn Greenwald, who has been a guest on RT, wrote that RT presenting the Julian Assange show led to \"a predictable wave of snide, smug attacks from American media figures\". Mark Adomanis rebuts some of the \"fevered denunciations\" against RT and Julian Assange in an article in \"Forbes\". A \"Moscow Times\" writer noted that RT has received \"considerable\" criticism in general.\n\nThe English language RT International, RT America and RT UK channels carry similar programming, with the latter channels focusing more on news from the United States and the United Kingdom. RT Arabic and Actualidad RT in Spanish feature their own news presenters, as well as translated versions of RT's English programming.\n\nMarcin Maczka writes that RT's ample financing has allowed RT to attract experienced journalists and use the latest technology. RT anchors and correspondents tend to concentrate on controversial world issues such as the financial and banking scandals, corporate impact on the global economy, and western demonstrations. It has also aired views by various conspiracy theorists, including neo-Nazis, White Supremacists, and Holocaust deniers (presented as \"human rights activists\"). News from Russia is of secondary importance and such reports emphasize Russian modernisation and economic achievements, as well as Russian culture and natural landscapes, while downplaying Russia's social problems or corruption.\n\nIn 2017, RT ran a mock live tweeting program under the hashtag \"#1917LIVE\" to mark the 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.\n\nRT's current feature programs include (with presenters parenthesised):\n\nRT's current on-air staff includes 25 people from RT News, 25 from RT America, and 8 from RT UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Jesse Zwick, RT persuades \"legitimate experts and journalists\" to appear as guests by allowing them to speak at length on issues ignored by larger news outlets. It frequently interviews progressive and libertarian academics, intellectuals and writers from organisations like \"The Nation\", \"Reason magazine\", Human Events, Center for American Progress and the Cato Institute who are critical of United States foreign and civil liberties policies. RT also features little known commentators, including anarchists, anti-globalists and left-wing activists. Journalist Danny Schechter holds that a primary reason for RT's success in the United States is that RT is \"a force for diversity\" which gives voice to people \"who rarely get heard in current mainstream US media.\"\n\nNotable guests have included think tank intellectuals like Jared Bernstein, John Feffer and Lawrence Korb; journalists and writers Jacob Sullum, Pepe Escobar, and Brian Doherty, and heads of state, including Ecuador's Rafael Correa, and Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Nigel Farage, the leader of UK Independence Party from 2010 to 2016, appeared on RT eighteen times from 2010 to 2014.\n\nIn 2010 journalist and blogger Julia Ioffe described RT as being \"provocative just for the sake of being provocative\" in its choice of guests and issue topics, featuring a Russian historian who predicted that the United States would soon be dissolved, showing speeches by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, reporting on homelessness in America, and interviewing the chairman of the New Black Panther Party. She wrote that in attempting to offer \"an alternate point of view, it is forced to talk to marginal, offensive, and often irrelevant figures\". \"The Economist\" magazine noted that RT's programming, while sometimes interesting and unobjectionable, and sometimes \"hard-edged\", also presents \"wild conspiracy theories\" that can be regarded as \"kooky\". A 2010 Southern Poverty Law Center report stated that RT extensively covered the \"birther\" and the \"New World Order\" conspiracy theories and interviewed militia organizer Jim Stachowiak and white nationalist Jared Taylor. An Al Jazeera English article stated that RT has a penchant \"for off-beat stories and conspiracy theories.\" The news channel has also been criticized for its lack of objectivity in its coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Miko Peled, the Israeli peace activist who has called the peace process \"a process of apartheid & colonization\" is a frequent guest on RT.\n\nMargarita Simonyan told Nikolaus von Twickel of \"The Moscow Times\" that RT started to grow once it became provocative and that controversy was vital to the channel. She said that RT's task was not to polish Moscow's reputation..\n\nManuel Ochsenreiter, a neo-Nazi, has repeatedly appeared on RT to represent the German point of view. RT News has also frequently hosted Richard B. Spencer, an American white supremacist airing his opinions in support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and has hosted Holocaust denier Ryan Dawson, presenting him as a human rights activist.\n\nSteve Bannon has stated that he has appeared on RT \"probably 100 times or more\".<ref name=\"Stone_Gordon_3/20/2017\"></ref>\n\nCritics regard RT as a propaganda outlet for the Russian government and its foreign policy.\n\nPascal Bonnamour, the head of the European department of Reporters Without Borders, called the newly announced network \"another step of the state to control information.\"\n\nCliff Kincaid, the director of Accuracy in Media's Center for Investigative Journalism, called RT \"the well-known disinformation outlet for Russian propaganda\".\n\nFor much of 2015, graduate students at Columbia School of Journalism took part in the RT Watch project, monitoring RT's (US) output. Casey Michel, who worked on the project, wrote \"RT ignores the inherent traits of journalism—checking sources, relaying facts, attempting honest reportage\" and \"you’ll find 'experts' lacking in expertise, conspiracy theories without backing, and, from time to time, outright fabrication for the sake of pushing a pro-Kremlin line\". The results were compiled in a Tumblr blog.\n\nIn a 2005 interview with U.S. government-owned external broadcaster Voice of America, the Russian-Israeli blogger Anton Nosik said the creation of RT \"smacks of Soviet-style propaganda campaigns.\"\n\nIn 2009, Luke Harding (then Moscow correspondent for \"The Guardian\") described RT's advertising campaign in the United Kingdom as an \"ambitious attempt to create a new post-Soviet global propaganda empire.\"\n\nFormer KGB officer turned political refugee, Konstantin Preobrazhensky, criticized RT as \"a part of the Russian industry of misinformation and manipulation\". RT presents itself as a liberal alternative in the United States, but in Europe it appears to have become the flagship of resurgent nationalist parties.\n\nIn Russia, Andrey Illarionov, former advisor to Vladimir Putin, has called the channel \"the best Russian propaganda machine targeted at the outside world\". Media analyst Vasily Gatov wrote in a 2014 \"Moscow Times\" article that sharp ethical and reporting skills are not required for Russian media employees, including RT.\n\n – Linas Antanas Linkevičius, Lithuania's Minister of Foreign Affairs, posted on Twitter on 9 March 2014 amid the Crimean crisis, \"Russia Today propaganda machine is no less destructive than military marching in Crimea\".\n\nIn April 2017, during his successful run for President of France, Emmanuel Macron's campaign team banned both RT and the Sputnik news agency from campaign events. A Macron spokesperson said the two outlets showed a \"systematic desire to issue fake news and false information\". Macron later said during a press conference that RT and Sputnik were \"agencies of influence and propaganda, lying propaganda—no more, no less\".\n\nIn October 2017, Twitter banned both RT and Sputnik from advertising on their social networking service amid accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, sparking an angry response from the Russian foreign ministry.\n\nIn November 2017, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt announced that Google will be \"deranking\" stories from RT and Sputnik in response to allegations about election meddling by President Putin's government, provoking an accusation of censorship from both outlets.\n\nIn March 2018, John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor of the British Labour Party, advised fellow Labour MPs to boycott RT and said he would no longer appear on the channel. He said: \"We tried to be fair with them and as long as they abide by journalistic standards that are objective that's fine but it looks as if they have gone beyond that line\". However, a party representative said: \"We are keeping the issue under review\".\n\nA 2007 article in the Christian Science Monitor wrote that RT reported on the good job Putin was doing in the world and next to nothing on things like the conflict in Chechnya or the murder of government critics. According to a 2010 report by \"The Independent\", RT journalists have said that coverage of sensitive issues in Russia is allowed, but direct criticism of Vladimir Putin or President Dmitry Medvedev was not. Masha Karp wrote in \"Standpoint\" magazine that contemporary Russian issues \"such as the suppression of free speech and peaceful demonstrations, or the economic inefficiency and corrupt judiciary, are either ignored or their significance played down\". In 2008, Stephen Heyman wrote in \"The New York Times\" that in RT's Russia, \"corruption is not quite a scourge but a symptom of a developing economy.\" Speaking after the launch of RT America, Garry Kasparov said \"Russia Today is an extension of the methods and approach of the state-controlled media inside Russia, applied in a bid to influence the American cable audience\".\n\n\"The New Republic\" writer James Kirchick accused the network of \"often virulent anti-Americanism, worshipful portrayal of Russian leaders.\" Edward Lucas wrote in \"The Economist\" (quoted in Al Jazeera English) that the core of RT was \"anti-Westernism.\" Julia Ioffe wrote \"Often, it seemed that Russia Today was just a way to stick it to the U.S. from behind the façade of legitimate newsgathering.\" Shaun Walker wrote in \"The Independent\" that RT \"has made a name for itself as a strident critic of US policy.\" Allesandra Stanley wrote in \"The New York Times\" that RT is \"like the Voice of America, only with more money and a zesty anti-American slant.\" David Weigel writes that RT goes further than merely creating distrust of the United States government, to saying, in effect: \"You can trust the Russians more than you can trust those bastards.\"\n\nRussian studies professor Stephen F. Cohen stated in 2012 that RT does a lot of stories that \"reflect badly\" on the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and much of Western Europe and that they are \"particularly aggrieved by American sermonizing abroad.\" Citing that RT compares stories about Russia allowing mass protests of the 2011–2012 Russian election protests with those of U.S. authorities nationwide arresting members of the Occupy movement. Cohen states that despite the pro-Kremlin slant, \"any intelligent viewer can sort this out. I doubt that many idiots find their way to RT.\" RT also have proliferated stories such as the police brutality in the US, the crack cocaine usage of Toronto mayor Rob Ford, and the poverty among people of Arab descent in Western Europe.\n\nAccording to Lithuania's STRATCOM Colonel, \"RT rarely takes a single, anti-Western media line on any given story. That would be too obvious. Instead, RT journalists present gaggles of competing and contradicting narratives which together create the impression that the truth is indecipherable\".\n\nJohn Feffer, co-director of Foreign Policy in Focus says he appears on RT as well as the U.S.-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, commented \"I’ve been given the opportunity to talk about military expenditures in a way I haven’t been given in U.S. outlets\". On the fairness issue, he said: \"You're going to find blind spots in the coverage for any news organization\".\n\nA 2013 article in \"Der Spiegel\" noted that RT \"uses a chaotic mixture of conspiracy theories and crude propaganda\", pointing to a program that \"mutated\" the Boston Marathon bombings into a U.S. government conspiracy.\n\nThe launch of RT UK was the subject of much comment in the British press. In \"The Observer\", Nick Cohen accused the channel of spreading conspiracy theories and being a \"prostitution of journalism\" and in \"The Times\", Oliver Kamm called on broadcast regulator Ofcom to act against this \"den of deceivers\".\n\nIn 2015, Peter Pomerantsev in \"The Guardian\" accused RT of disinformation and of spreading conspiracy theories.\n\nJournalists at \"The Daily Beast\" and \"The Washington Post\" have noted that RT employs Tony Gosling, an exponent of long-discredited theories concerning the alleged control of the world by Illuminati and the Czarist antisemitic forgery \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\".\n\nFor example, Russia Today broadcast stories about microchips being implanted into office workers in EU to make them more \"submissive\"; about \"majority\" of Europeans supporting Russian annexation of Crimea; EU preparing \"a form of genocide\" against Russians; in Germany it falsely reported about a kidnapping of a Russian girl; that \"NATO planned to store nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe\"; that Hillary Clinton fell ill; it has also on many occasions misrepresented or invented statements from European leaders. In response to accusations of spreading fake news RT started its own FakeCheck project. The Poynter Institute conducted a content analysis of FakeCheck and concluded it \"mixes some legitimate debunks with other scantily sourced or dubiously framed 'fact checks.'\"\n\nA report by RAND called the RT strategy \"a firehose of falsehood\", where fake stories are distributed in \"high-volume and multichanneel, rapid, continuous, and repetitive\" with no regard to consistency, where the high volume makes them difficult to counter.\n\nRT has been accused of being anti-Israel by Jewish and Israeli sources, describing its reporting as being unbalanced. Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman made a complaint to Putin at their official meeting in 2012.\n\nDuring the 2008 South Ossetia War, RT correspondent William Dunbar resigned after the network refused to let him report on Russian airstrikes of civilian targets, stating, \"any issue where there is a Kremlin line, RT is sure to toe it.\" According to \"Variety\", sources at RT confirmed that Dunbar had resigned, but rejected that it was over bias. One senior RT journalist told the magazine, \"the Russian coverage I have seen has been much better than much of the Western coverage... When you look at the Western media, there is a lot of genuflection towards the powers that be. Russian news coverage is largely pro-Russia, but that is to be expected.\"\n\nShaun Walker, the Moscow correspondent for \"The Independent\", said that RT had \"instructed reporters not to report from Georgian villages within South Ossetia that had been ethnically cleansed.\" Julia Ioffe wrote that an RT journalist whose reporting deviated from \"the Kremlin line that Georgians were slaughtering unarmed Ossetians\" was reprimanded. Human Rights Watch said that RT's claim of 2,000 South Ossetian casualties was exaggerated.\nIn 2012, Jesse Zwick of \"The New Republic\" criticized RT, stating it held that \"civilian casualties in Syria are minimal, foreign intervention would be disastrous, and any humanitarian appeals from Western nations are a thin veil for a NATO-backed move to isolate Iran, China, and Russia.\" He wrote that RT wants to \"make the United States look out of line for lecturing Russia.\" Zwick also wrote that RT provided a \"disproportionate amount of time\" to covering libertarian Republican Ron Paul during his 2012 presidential campaign. Writing after her 2014 on-air resignation, Liz Wahl suggested the reason for this \"wasn't his message of freedom and liberty but his non-interventionist stance and consistent criticism of U.S. foreign policy. His message fit RT's narrative that the United States is a huge bully.\" In a June 2011 broadcast of \"Adam vs. the Man\", host Adam Kokesh had endorsed fundraising for Paul, leading to a complaint to the Federal Election Commission charging a political contribution had been made by a foreign corporation. Kokesh denied his cancellation in August was related to the complaint, but said it did involve Paul's aide Jesse Benton.\n\nIn September 2012, U.K. broadcast regulator Ofcom found that two Libyan dispatches broadcast by RT's Lizzie Phelan in a year earlier were in breach of its code on accuracy and impartiality. The following November, RT was again found in breach of impartiality rules in relation to its coverage of the Syrian conflict. An August 2013 story concerning unverified reports of the killing of 450 Kurdish civilians near the Turkey-Syria border was also found to have breached Ofcom's rules. That December, Ofcom found RT in breach of its standards in relation to the impartiality of a documentary entitled \"Syrian Diary\" broadcast the previous March. Speaking in 2014 former RT reporter Sara Firth said that there had previously been examples of senior editorial interference, and that she had been pulled out of Syria after some \"very heated discussions\" about the channel's coverage.\n\nOn 4 March 2014, \"Breaking The Set\" host Abby Martin, speaking directly to her viewing audience during the show's closing statement, said that even though she works for RT, she is against Russia's intervention in Ukraine. She said that \"what Russia did is wrong\", as she is against intervention by any nation into other countries' affairs. Later, Martin asserted that RT still supports her despite her differences of opinion with the Russian government. RTs press office suggested that Martin would be sent to Crimea and responded to accusations of propaganda, stating \"the charges of propaganda tend to pop up every time a news outlet, particularly RT, dares to show the side of events that does not fit the mainstream narrative, regardless of the realities on the ground. This happened in Georgia, this is happening in Ukraine\". Glenn Greenwald said that American media elites love to mock Russian media, especially RT, as being a source of shameless pro-Putin propaganda, where free expression is strictly barred. Agreeing the \"network has a strong pro-Russian bias\", he suggested that Martin's action \"remarkably demonstrated what 'journalistic independence' means\".\n\nOn 5 March 2014, RT Washington, D.C. bureau anchor Liz Wahl resigned on air, blaming RT for propaganda. Wahl stated that what \"broke\" her was that RT censored a question from her interview with Ron Paul about \"Russia's \"intervention\" in Ukraine\". In response, RT released a statement: \"When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional. But when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt. We wish Liz the best of luck on her chosen path\". In a March 2014 \"Politico\" article, Wahl stated \"For about two and a half years. I’d looked the other way as the network smeared America for the sake of making the Kremlin look better by comparison, while it sugarcoated atrocities by one brutal dictator after another.\"\nWhen asked about a clip of her interviewing a guest on RT by Brian Stelter, host of CNN's \"Reliable Sources\", Wahl responded,\n\"The New York Times\" op-ed columnist Nicholas Kristof commented on CNN's \"Piers Morgan Live\" about Wahl's and Martin's initial actions, \"admire their outspokenness but, you know, at the end of the day, RT is a Russian propaganda arm, and I don't think its going to matter very much to the geopolitical consequences here.\"\n\nFormer RT Moscow anchor Stacy Bivens, and other former RT journalists speaking under anonymity according to BuzzFeed, said they regretted working for the network, citing their dislike of the network's use of propaganda. Bivens, for example, was explicitly asked to go to Germany and procure a story proving that \"Germany is a failed state\". When she rejected, other reporters were sent instead.\n\nSteve Bloomfield, the foreign editor of \"Monocle\" wrote that RT's \"coverage of Ukraine could not have been kinder to Moscow if Vladimir Putin had chosen the running order himself. While Putin kept up the pretence that there were no Russian troops in Crimea, so too did RT. The storming of government buildings across eastern Ukraine has been portrayed as the understandable actions of peace-loving protesters who fear \"chaos\" in Kiev\".\n\nAfter the July 2014 crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, RT rushed to blame others for the plane's shoot-down in Ukraine amid accusations by Ukrainian fighters of Russian involvement in the crash. Speaking of RT's coverage, Sarah Oates, professor of journalism at the University of Maryland said \"But if you’re going to engage in propaganda, you have to do it well. They have completely embarrassed themselves.\"\n\nSara Firth, a London-based correspondent with RT resigned in protest over the network's coverage of the MH17 disaster. Shortly before resigning, she tweeted, \"RT style guide Rule 1: It is ALWAYS * Ukraine's fault (* add name as applicable)\". She told the Guardian \"I walked into the newsroom and there was an eyewitness account making allegations [against Ukraine] and analysis, if you can call it, from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, in a situation like that where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life.\" She also noted that \"There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong\" and stated \"I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it.\" In follow-up interview she said \"In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and so what you wind up with on air is outright misinformation.\" Calling RT \"mass information manipulation\" Firth said \"they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove.\" She also stated that \"The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason.\"\n\nThe following November, RT was again found in breach of Ofcom's impartiality rules. This time in relation to its coverage of the Ukraine crisis, specifically events leading up to the annexation by Russia of Crimea. For repeated breaches of its \"due impartially\" rules, Ofcom put RT management \"on notice that any future breaches of the due impartiality rules may result in further regulatory action, including consideration of a statutory sanction\".\n\nIn January 2015, Ofcom found RT (and the BBC) not in breach of rules on generally accepted standards following a complaint about the use of graphic imagery of bodies at the MH17 crash site.\nFollowing the March 2015 European Council summit which concluded that action was needed to \"challenge Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns\", the European External Action Service was tasked to respond. European Parliament briefing notes on the situation called RT \"Russia's main international media weapon\". The counter-propaganda strategy subsequently developed by the EastStratCom Task Force, a small group of eight officials, included launching the \"EU vs Disinformation\" website with a headline of \"don't be deceived, question even more\".\n\nIn September 2015, Ofcom found RT in breach of the impartiality rules in its coverage of the events in Ukraine and Syria. It also upheld the complaint by the BBC that allegations made in an episode of \"The Truthseeker\" that a BBC \"Panorama\" film, \"Saving Syria's Children\", had faked a parts of a report on a chemical weapon attack in Syria were \"materially misleading\".\n\nIn an episode of \"The Truthseeker\", named \"Genocide of Eastern Ukraine\", they claimed that the Ukrainian government was deliberately bombing civilians, had murdered and tortured journalists, as well as crucifying babies. Ukrainian army forces were accused of \"ethnic cleansing\" and were compared to the Nazis in World War Two. The only response to the allegations in the broadcast was in the form of a caption saying \"Kiev claims it is not committing genocide, denies casualty reports\", which appeared on screen for six seconds. According to Ofcom the broadcast had \"little or no counterbalance or objectivity\".\n\nA spokesperson for the media regulator said: \"Ofcom found that RT broadcast content that was either materially misleading or not duly impartial. These are significant failings and we are therefore requiring RT to broadcast two clear statements on our decision which correct these failures.\"\n\nIn October 2015, David J. Kramer, senior director for human rights and democracy at the McCain Institute for International Leadership, suggested that Western countries freeze RT's assets \"not because of the odious things it spews\" but as part of the Yukos shareholder case.\n\nA report released by the US think-tank the RAND Corporation in 2016 called RT part of \"a wider Russian propaganda operation\" named the \"Firehose of Falsehood\". The paper called \"Russian faux-news propaganda channels, such as RT\" insidious and that \"they look like news programs, and the persons appearing on them are represented as journalists and experts, making audience members much more likely to ascribe credibility to the misinformation these sources are disseminating\".\n\nIn July 2016, Ofcom again found RT in breach of its impartiality rules, this time over coverage of the Turkish government's treatment of Kurdish people. Two episodes of \"Going Underground\" originally broadcast in March, included claims of attacks, atrocities and genocide against the Kurds, and that \"Turkey supports ISIS\" without offering adequate counterbalance. RT's representatives stated the network \"finds it especially difficult to obtain pro-Turkey views for its programming\" because of \"political tensions between Russia and Turkey following the downing of a Russian military aircraft by Turkish warplanes in November 2015\".\n\nIn November 2016, after the US Presidential Election, \"The Washington Post\" reported that RT and Sputnik were \"state-funded Russian information services that mimic the style and tone of independent news organizations yet sometimes include false and misleading stories in their reports\" and also that \"RT, Sputnik and other Russian sites used social-media accounts to amplify misleading stories already circulating online\". The Post was criticized by \"The Intercept\", \"Fortune\", and \"Rolling Stone\" for relying in part on an analysis by PropOrNot, an anonymous organization with no reputation for fact-checking.\n\nIn December 2016, Ofcom found RT in breach of its impartiality rules for the 10th time since the English-language channel launched. A \"Crosstalk\" episode broadcast the previous July, contained a debate about the NATO 2016 Warsaw summit in which all members of the panel expressed critical views. RT's representatives again stated that they couldn't find anybody with alternative opinions willing to take part, and that captions with pro-NATO comments should have been added before broadcast, but the wrong text was accidentally used.\n\nOn 12 January 2017, RT was accidentally broadcast for around 10 minutes on a web stream of U.S. public affairs service C-SPAN. RT stated that while it was testing its systems in preparation for the inauguration of Donald Trump, its signal was \"mistakenly routed onto the primary encoder feeding C-SPAN1's signal to the internet, rather than to an unused backup.\"\n\nOn 19 January 2017, RT stated that it had been temporarily restricted from posting media on its Facebook page until 21 January, after the service claimed that RT had infringed on the copyrights of Radio Liberty's Current Now TV when broadcasting a live stream of Barack Obama's final press conference as president of the United States. Current Time TV denied that it had sent any specific complaints to Facebook, and both RT and Current Now TV stated that they had obtained their feed from the Associated Press. The restriction was removed after about 20 hours, but Facebook did not say officially if this was because of a technical error or a policy issue.\n\nIn September 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice informed RT America that it must register as a foreign agent of the Russian government. Margarita Simonyan, RT’s editor-in-chief, condemned the action as an assault on freedom of speech. A spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry threatened retaliatory measures against American journalists.\n\nOn 13 November 2017, RT America officially registered as a \"foreign agent\" in the United States with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Under the act, RT will be required to disclose financial information.\n\n\n\n"}

It was reorganized with a new name: Voice of Russia., which has also since been reorganized and renamed Radio Sputnik. At its peak, Radio Moscow broadcast in over 70 languages using transmitters in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Cuba.\n\nRadio Moscow's interval signal was 'Wide Is My Motherland' ().\n\nIts first emission in a foreign language was in German on 29 October 1929, and later in English and French. Previously, Radio Moscow broadcast in 1922 with a transmitter station RV-1 in the Moscow region, and a second broadcasting centre came on air at Leningrad in 1925. By 1939, Radio Moscow was broadcasting (on mediumwave and shortwave) in English, French, Indonesian, German, Italian and Arabic. Radio Moscow did express concern over the rise of German dictator Adolf Hitler during the 1930s, and its Italian mediumwave service specifically was jammed by an order of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini during the late 1930s.\n\nThe U.S. was first targeted by Radio Moscow during the early 1950s, with transmitters in the Moscow region. Later Western North America was targeted by the newly constructed Vladivostok and Magadan relay stations.\n\nThe first broadcasts to Africa went on the air in the late 1950s in English and French.\n\nIn 1961 Radio Moscow for the first time spoke in three African languages: Amharic, Swahili and Hausa. Over time, listeners in Africa got a chance to tune into Radio Moscow in another eight African languages.\n\nThe first centralized news bulletin went on the air in August 1963 and reached out to listeners all over the world. In the years of the Cold War most news reports and commentaries focused on the relations between the United States and Soviet Union.\n\nIn the 1970s the cream of Radio Moscow's commentator teams united in a radio journal, called \"News and Views\". Taking part in the ambitious project were Viktor Glazunov, Leonid Rassadin, Yuri Shalygin, Alexander Kushnir, Yuri Solton and Vladislav Chernukha. Over the years the journal grew into a major information and analytical program of the Radio Moscow foreign service.\n\nIn the late 1970s its English language service was renamed \"Radio Moscow World Service\". The project was launched and supervised by a long-time Radio Moscow journalist and manager Alexander Evstafiev. Later a North American service, African service and even a \"UK & Ireland\" service (all in English) operated for a few hours per day alongside the regular (24 Hour) English World Service.\n\nAt one time in 1980, Radio Moscow had transmissions on the Medium Wave broadcast on 600 kHz (later 1040 kHz) from Havana, Cuba which reached the Caribbean islands and US State of Florida.\n\nRadio Moscow's shortwave (SW) transmission network has never been equalled in its transmission power, directivity and reach. During the station's peak in the 1980s the same programmes could often be heard on anything up to forty frequencies on the (heavily overcrowded) shortwave bands although the station never published its complete time/frequency schedule as radio frequencies were regarded as state secrets by the Soviet government. \n\nOne of the most popular programmes on air in the 1980s, due to its informal presentation that contrasted with most other shows, was the 'Listeners’ Request Club' hosted by prominent radio presenter Vasily Strelnikov. Another popular feature which began on Radio Moscow was \"Moscow Mailbag\", which answered listeners' questions in English about the Soviet Union. Since 1957, the programme was presented by Joe Adamov, who was known for his command of the English language and his good humour.\n\nOn 22 December 1993, the Russian president Boris Yeltsin issued a decree which reorganized Radio Moscow with a new name: Voice of Russia.\n\nBy 1931, when Radio Moscow came under the control of the newly established \"Gostelradio\", the service comprised eight languages: English, French, German, Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, Swedish.\n\nBy the 1970s there were 64 languages:\n\nIn 1989 Russian, Malay and Tagalog were added.\n\n\nIn 10 of the 14 union republics besides the RSFSR there were foreign broadcasting services.\n\nUntil 1988 there was no Russian service of Radio Moscow. Instead there were several other services for Russians abroad like the \"Fifth programme\" of the All-Union Radio (since 1960), \"Radio Motherland\" (Радиостанция Родина) of the \"Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Fellow-Countrymen Abroad\" or for fishermen \"Radio Pacific Ocean\" (Радиостанция Тихий Океан, 1963–2001) from Vladivostok and \"Radio Atlantic\" (Радиостанция Атлантика, 1965–2004) from Murmansk.\n\nThe USSR pioneered the use of HRS 8/8/1 antennas (horizontal dipole curtain, eight columns, eight rows, with electrically steerable pattern) for highly targeted shortwave broadcasting long before HRS 12/6/1 technology became available in the west. HRS 8/8/1 curtain arrays create a 10-degree beam of shortwave energy, and can provide a highly audible signal to a target area some 7,000 km away.\n\n\n"}

There were two distinct currencies issued by the National Bank of the Republika Srpska. The first was introduced in 1992 in conjunction with the Yugoslav dinar of that year, to which it was equal. The second was introduced on October 1, 1993, replacing the first at a rate of one million to one and matching the revaluation of the Yugoslav currency. Following this, the Republika Srpska used Yugoslav currency (first the \"1994 dinar\" and then \"novi dinar\") until 1998, when the convertible mark was introduced.\n\nThe two currencies were only issued in note form, with the first issued in denominations of 10 dinars up to 10 billion dinars and the second in denominations of 5000 dinars up to 50 billion dinars. The designs of the banknotes varied very little within the issues of the two currencies. The \"1992 dinar\" notes featured the arms of the republic on both sides, whilst the \"1993 dinar\" notes had a portrait of Petar Kočić on the obverse. Some of the issues in 1993 were overprints on 1992 banknotes.\n\n"}

It meant the city was an inalienable part of the royal estate; the king could not sell or pledge the city. At the beginning of the 16th Century, about 40 cities enjoyed this privilege. The citizens of these cities had a higher position in the estates of the realm than any other subjects.\n\nA similar status was the (plural ); these were a source of income for the Queen. Another source of income for the king were cities with the status of (plural ), but these were not inalienable and had a lesser status. These cities had a duty of socage. Originally, this meant that each citizen had to work the kings land a certain number of days each year, but this was soon replaced by a cash payment.\n\nCitizens of the royal cities had a special social status. It took a legal deed to become citizen. If the applicant purchased a home, or lived in the city for a long time, or could prove \"good\" ancestry and a decent family life and, if he had been a subject, could show a release certificate, then the applicant had a chance to be admitted to this privileged class. There were other ways to obtain this status: one could purchase it, or marry into it. Sometimes a city would offer citizenship, especially to educated inhabitants.\n\nThe precise rights and duties of the citizens differed considerably from city to city. They depended on the status of the city. Even among the citizens, there was a hierarchy, which was reflected in income, the order at the Last Supper and the seat in the church, but also at the location of the house.\n\nCzech name, German name, and year of appointment:\n\n"}

Summer teams comprise administrative and maintenance personnel, helicopter crew and scientists from various countries and can be up to 100 people. Overwintering teams consist of scientists and support personnel from South Africa, typically totalling 10 members in recent years.\n\nThe research programme at the SANAE IV base is carried out under the auspices of the South African National Antarctic Programme (SANAP).\n\nThe first expedition, SANAE 1, overwintered at Norway Station, taken over by South Africa from Norway after the end of the IGY. Later teams overwintered at SANAE I, SANAE II and SANAE III, built on the Fimbul Ice Shelf near the Blåskimen Island. Built on the moving ice shelf, these stations inevitably got buried, and eventually broke off as part of icebergs drifting away. Successive stations were always repositioned at the same geographical position of S 70º18 W 2º22. SANAE IV was built on the nunatak Vesleskarvet in the hope of having a base with a longer lifetime.

{"id": "2424311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2424311", "title": "SES Americom", "text": "SES Americom\n\nSES Americom was a major commercial satellite operator of North American geosynchronous satellites based in the United States. The company started as RCA Americom in 1975 before being bought by General Electric in 1986 and then later acquired by SES S.A. in 2001. In September 2009, SES Americom and SES New Skies merged into SES World Skies.\n\nRCA American Communications (RCA Americom) was founded in 1975 as an operator of RCA Astro Electronics-built satellites. The company's first satellite; Satcom 1, was launched on December 12, 1975. Satcom 1 was one of the earliest geostationary satellites.\n\nSatcom 1 was instrumental in helping early cable TV channels (such as Superstation TBS and CBN) to become initially successful, because these channels distributed their programming to all of the local cable TV headends using the satellite. Additionally, it was the first satellite used by broadcast TV networks in the United States, like ABC, NBC, and CBS, to distribute their programming to all of their local affiliate stations. Satcom 1 was so widely used because it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 (24 transponders as opposed to Westar 1’s 12), which resulted in lower transponder usage costs.\n\n14 more (increasingly sophisticated) Satcom satellites would enter service from 1976 to 1992. In 1986 General Electric acquired RCA and renamed the Americom unit to GE American Communications (GE Americom). From 1996 new satellites were named in the GE-# series, i.e. GE-1 in 1996, GE-2 in 1997 etc.\n\nIn November 2001, GE sold its GE Americom unit to SES for $5 billion in cash and stock. As a result of the sale, GE Americom was renamed SES Americom and SES Global was formed as the parent company. SES's existing operations were moved to the newly created SES Astra subsidiary.\n\nAfter the acquisition of GE Americom by SES, all the satellites previously named with the GE-# prefix were renamed AMC-# (i.e., GE-1 renamed AMC-1, and so on).\n\nThe President and CEO of the new SES Americom was Dean Olmstead. He left the company in 2004 and was succeeded by Edward Horowitz. SES Americom was subsequently placed under Robert Bednarek, the President and CEO of SES New Skies.\n\nIn September 2009, SES Americom and SES New Skies were re-branded SES World Skies.\n\nBefore being merged into SES World Skies in 2009 (which expanded coverage to Middle East and Africa), SES Americom operated the following North American satellites in geosynchronous orbit:\n\n\n"}
