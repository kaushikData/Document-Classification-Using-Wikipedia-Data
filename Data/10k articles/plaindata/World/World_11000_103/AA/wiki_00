In all cases, women must undergo counseling first. After 20 weeks, abortion is only permitted to save the woman's life or health. Only persons who perform illegal abortions are criminally punishable, never the women who undergo them.\n\nThe legal status of abortion is governed by a 2008 law; previously, it was governed by the Law of 7 October 1977, made when Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of Yugoslavia.\n\n, the abortion rate was 1.4 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 years, one of the lowest in Europe.

{"id": "227976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227976", "title": "Battle of Seven Oaks", "text": "Battle of Seven Oaks\n\nThe Battle of Seven Oaks was a violent confrontation in what was known as the Pemmican War between the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and the North West Company (NWC), rivals in the fur trade, that took place on 19 June 1816. It was the climax of a long dispute in western Canada. The Métis people, who fought for the North West Company, called it \"the Victory of Frog Plain\" (\"la Victoire de la Grenouillère\").\n\nIn 1814, Miles MacDonell, Governor of the Red River Colony (the area around present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba), issued the Pemmican Proclamation, which prohibited the export of pemmican from the colony for the next year. It was meant to guarantee adequate supplies for the Hudson's Bay Colony, but it was viewed by the North West Company as a ploy by employees of the Earl of Selkirk (majority shareholder of the Hudson's Bay Company) to monopolize the foodstuff, which was important to the North West Company.\n\nThe local Métis did not acknowledge the authority of the Red River Settlement, and this stand was probably consistent with the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The Pemmican Proclamation was a blow to both the Métis and North West Company. The North West Company accused the HBC of unfairly monopolizing the fur trade by this edict. As the North West Company floundered under these and other restrictions, the HBC attempted to take it over, but was not successful.\n\nLater in 1815, after several conflicts and suffering from \"severe emotional instability\", MacDonnell resigned as governor of the Red River Colony. He was replaced by Robert Semple, an American businessman with no previous experience in the fur trade.\n\nIn 1816 a band of mostly Métis which included some French-Canadians, English, and Indigenous employees working for the North West Company, led by Cuthbert Grant, seized a supply of pemmican from the Hudson's Bay Company, which previously had been stolen from the Métis. They were travelling to meet traders of the North West Company, to whom they intended to sell it.\n\nThey encountered Semple and a group of HBC men and settlers north of Fort Douglas along the Red River at a location known to the English as Seven Oaks, and called \"la Grenouillière\" (Frog Plain) by the Métis. The North West Company sent a French-Canadian, François-Firmin Boucher, to speak to Semple's men. He and Semple argued, and a gunfight ensued when the English tried to arrest Boucher and seize his horse. Although early reports said that the Métis fired the first shot and began the fray, the Royal Commissioner W.B. Coltman determined with \"next to certainty\" that it was one of Semple's men who fired first. The Métis were skilled sharpshooters and outnumbered Semple's forces by nearly 3 to 1. They repulsed the attack, killing 21 men, including Governor Semple, while suffering only one fatality, Joseph Letendre dit Battosh the 16 year-old son of Jean Baptiste Letendre. Pierre Falcon, a Métis poet, later celebrated the victory of the Métis in his song \"La Chanson de la Grenouillère\".\n\nOn the day after the battle, the settlers, demoralized from the losses, quickly gathered their belongings and prepared to leave the colony. On the next day, they set sail northward, leaving the Métis in command of the settlement.\n\nThe Métis were exonerated by W.B. Coltman, a Royal Commissioner appointed to investigate the incident, but Lord Selkirk attempted to prosecute several members of the North West Company for murder and kept Boucher in prison for nearly two years without specific charges. All trials ended in acquittals, and the remaining charges were dropped. Members of the North West Company counter-sued Selkirk, whose health and influence subsequently declined. Following Selkirk's death in 1820, the two companies merged in 1821. In 1828, Cuthbert Grant was given an annual salary and the position of \"warden of the plains of Red River\" by the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nIn 1891, the Manitoba Historical Society erected an obelisk monument commemorating the battle at the intersection of Main Street and Rupertsland Boulevard in the Winnipeg district of West Kildonan, the approximate centre of the battle site. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1920. The surrounding neighbourhood was named \"Seven Oaks\" after the battle. As part of Parks Canada reconciliation with the Métis, new interpretive plaques were installed and the Seven Oaks Park was re-landscaped. The site was officially reopened on 19 June 2016, to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle.\n"}

The new Bishop Krogh made Alstahaug Church the seat of his bishopric in the north, while Bishop Bugge stayed in Trondheim at the Nidaros Cathedral.

The service has since expanded to many European countries, while at the same time has been controversial in some countries laws and privacy concerns.\n\nEarly on, soon following the original introduction of Street View in the United States, there was talk of bringing the feature to Europe as well, but there were concerns over the legality of the feature due to stricter laws in most European countries than those of the United States regarding photography.\n\nThe first views anywhere outside the United States were introduced on July 2, 2008, when the Tour de France route was added. Nineteen camera icons, each indicating part of a French city or town and Cuneo, Italy, were included.\n\nOn October 14, 2008, camera icons were introduced in six French cities, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Paris and Toulouse. At the same time, all other icons that had been introduced in France on July 2, as well as the one in Cuneo, Italy, were removed, representing the first time in Street View's history that a camera icon that once marked a place was removed. However, the amount of coverage that France had since July 2 was not diminished.\n\nOn October 27, 2008, four Spanish metropolitan areas were added to the list of growing street view locations in Europe: Madrid, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia.\n\nOn October 29, 2008, Italy received four camera icons for the localities of Florence, Milan, Rome and Lake Como.\n\nOn March 18, 2009, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were added. In the case of Great Britain, only major centres were uploaded and even coverage of those city centres was incomplete. For example, Edinburgh was missing Street View images of two of its key thoroughfares: Princes Street and the Royal Mile (although portions of both were visible from adjoining streets that had been imaged).\n\nIn May 2009, Google Germany released a list of German cities that were to be scanned or rescanned in May and June 2009.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, areas in Switzerland and Portugal were added.\n\nOn October 7, 2009, parts of the Czech Republic were added.\n\nOn November 9, 2009, more locations in the Netherlands and Spain were added.\n\nOn December 2, 2009, more locations in France and Italy were added as well as various tourist sites in England.\n\nOn January 20, 2010, Sweden and Denmark were added, as well as more locations in the United Kingdom, Italy (7 regions are fully covered), Portugal, the Czech Republic (mostly Prague), and the Netherlands.\n\nOn February 9, 2010, Norway and Finland were added, with coverage of much of southern Norway and most of Finland.

More locations in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway were also added.\n\nOn February 1, 2011, Street Views were added of several art museums across Europe, including the Palace of Versailles, the State Hermitage Museum, the Uffizi Gallery and Tate Britain.\n\nIn October 2011, the Bernina Railway between St. Moritz and Tirano was photographed and was added to Street View in early 2012. Bernina Railway is part of the Rhaetian Railway and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nOn November 23, 2011, Street View became available for almost all of Belgium. While Street View content had been recorded earlier, privacy issues kept Google from making it available to the public.\n\nOn February 22, 2012, Street View became available for 3 major cities in Russia: St. Petersburg, Moscow, and small parts of Kazan. Museum views were made available in Russia in 2011 for St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum and Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery.\nStreet Views of Piotrkowska Street in Łódź, Poland were also released.\n\nOn March 21, 2012, Street View became available in Poland for most major cities and landmarks.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, 5 Ukrainian cities were added: Donets'k, Lviv, Kharkiv, Kiev, and Odessa.\n\nOn May 14, 2012, Estonia and Latvia were added.

This occurred after more than half a year of unsuccessful negotiation between the Czech Republic and Google. However, on June 24, 2011 the cars started driving again, with the camera holder lowered by 30 centimeters for privacy reasons.\n\nIn November 2010, a British watchdog group said that Google broke the law by obtaining personal data from people. The British government said the company would not be fined for the breach.\n\nIn March 2011, legal action against Google Street View in Germany resulted in court ruling that the project is legal; however, Google later decided not to expand or update existing coverage of Germany by the service.\n\nIn April 2011, a temporary ban on Google Street View data collecting in Austria was lifted, after being imposed by national data protection agency in May 2010. Google announced it was satisfied with the decision, but also stated that it had no plans to offer Google Street View coverage in Austria in the foreseeable future. In July 2018 general street coverage was introduced in Austria.\n\nIn April 2013 Google was fined €145,000 for illegally recording information from unsecured wireless networks in Germany.\n\nThere is some criticism of privacy concerns as well.\n\n , , .\n"}

The course usually consists of sweet foods, but may include other items. The word \"dessert\" originated from the French word \"desservir\" \"to clear the table\" and the negative of the Latin word \"servire\".\n\nThere are a wide variety of desserts in western cultures, including cakes, cookies, biscuits, gelatins, pastries, ice creams, pies, puddings, and candies. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its natural sweetness. Many different cultures have their own variations of similar desserts around the world, such as in Russia, where many breakfast foods such as blini, oladyi, and syrniki can be served with honey and jam to make them popular as desserts.\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nJ\nM\nY\n\nCake is a form of bread or bread-like food. In its modern forms, it is typically a sweet baked dessert. In its oldest forms, cakes were normally fried breads or cheesecakes, and normally had a disk shape.

Most common custards are used as desserts or dessert sauces and typically include sugar and vanilla. Custard bases may also be used for quiches and other savory foods.

Ľudovít Štúr declared the independence of the Slovak nation from Hungary at the gathering. However, the Slovak National Council administered only Myjava and its surroundings and the volunteers were defeated after a few days.\n\nThe Slovak National Council also participated in the organization of the remaining Slovak volunteer Campaigns and other activities during the revolution. It ceased to exist in the autumn of 1849, after the revolution had been suppressed.\n\nThere is a commemorative tablet to the council near the Karlskirche in Vienna.\n"}

He became the oldest person to scale the peak in 1965 and when he spent 50 minutes at the peak, he set a world record for spending the longest time at the highest point on Earth. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honor of the Padma Shri in 1962 and followed it up with the third highest honour of the Padma Bhushan, in 1965, for his contributions to the sport of mountaineering.\n\nBorn in 1923 at Kewzing, a south Sikkimese village at the foot of Kangchenjunga in Northeast India, Sonam Gyatso started his career in 1946 as a school teacher at Lachung, in the northern part of the state. After three years of service, he joined the Frontier Constabulary Force of the Indian Air Force as a head constable in 1949 which gave him the opportunity to attend a basic mountaineering course at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, Darjeeling in 1954. His first chance at mountaineering came in 1957 when he was selected for the Nanda Devi expedition, but the attempt was unsuccessful. However, he completed his first successful expedition when he scaled the 26,897 ft of Cho Oyu peak in 1958, as a member of an all-Indian expedition, the first time an Indian team climbed a peak of that height.\n\nGyatso followed his Cho Oyu success with several successful climbs such as Annapurna III in 1961, Kanchengyao in 1961, Hathi Parbat in 1963, Rathong peak and Langpo Chung in 1964. In between, he attempted Mount Everest twice, in 1960 and 1962, but could not scale the peak on both attempts, though he reached up to 700 ft and 400 ft to the summit. Subsequently, he attempted Everest through the S Col-SE Ridge route and on 22 May 1965, he reached the summit at the age of 42 as a member of the first all-Indian Everest expedition, thus becoming the first person from Sikkim and the oldest person among all mountaineers to summit the peak. He spent 50 minutes at the top without oxygen supply which was then a world record. His record stood for over 13 years till Pierre Mazeaud summitted the peak on 15 October 1978 at the age of 49. The attempt also set another world record for the highest number of successful climbers in a single expedition; the team strength of 9 members broke the record set earlier by an American expedition of 6 members. India Posts issued a postage stamp in commemoration of the achievement. Later, he also scaled the Siniolchu peak.\n\nGyatso was married to Kunzang Choden and the couple had five children. Gyatso was serving as the founder principal of Sonam Gyatso Mountaineering Institute (SGMI) when he died on 22 April 1968 at a hospital in New Delhi, at the age of 45, succumbing to frost bite suffered during one of his trials.\n\nAfter two successful expeditions and before his second failed attempt on Everest, the Government of India awarded Gaytso the honor of the Padma Shri in 1962. The government followed it up with the higher award of the Padma Bhushan in January 1965, four months before his successful Everest climb in May. The Government of Sikkim honored him with their highest civilian award of Pema Dorji Award the same year and he received one more honor, the Arjuna Award from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, the second highest Indian sports award. He also received the Gold Medal from Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF), in 1960 after his first attempt on Everest. The Old Tibet Road in Gangtok has since been renamed as \"Sonam Gyatso Marg\" in his honor. The mountaineering institute in Rathong, Sikkim where he served as the founder principal, is now known as \"Sonam Gyatso Mountaineering Institute\" since 1968.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18765292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18765292", "title": "Voice of Indonesia", "text": "Voice of Indonesia\n\nRRI World Service, Voice of Indonesia (VOI) is an autonomous division under Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI). The organization is a public broadcasting service. It is a national radio station that broadcasts all over Indonesia and abroad to serve all Indonesia citizens anywhere in the country and abroad. RRI also provides information about Indonesia to people around the world. Voice of Indonesia is the division for abroad broadcasting. As an autonomous division, VOI has its own independent structure so it can find their own financial resources through marketing.\n\nWhen Indonesia declared its independence on 17 August 1945, the new country needed an effective tool to announce its declaration of independence to the whole nation and to the world audience. At 19:00 on the same day, M. Jusuf Ronodipuro, founder of the RRI, has read the proclamation of news on Hoso Kyoku, Japanese occupation Radio. He was also supported by Dr. Abdulrahman Saleh, who had a passion for radio broadcasting. Both of them then launched the \"Voice of Free Indonesia\" on 23 August 1945. The first Indonesian President Sukarno delivered a speech on this radio on 25 August and Vice President Mohammad Hatta, did the same on 29 August. At that time, radio broadcasting was the most powerful media in order to deliver the message to reach the audiences around the world. To carry out this mission, the new Republic of Indonesia took over the former Dutch Colonial Government Radio station in Yogyakarta.\n\nThe Indonesian broadcasting across the world was named \"Voice of Free Indonesia\" On 11 September 1945, the radio station became Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI), the head organization of \"Voice of Indonesia\". During the Indonesian National Revolution, a Scottish American woman named K'tut Tantri, who was sympathetic to the Indonesian republicans, made several English language-broadcasts on the Voice of Free Indonesia. Her broadcasts were targeted at Western listeners and she gained the nickname \"Surabaya Sue\" due to her support for the Indonesian nationalists. During the early days of Indonesian independence, radio broadcasting played an important role in sending the new nation's message to overseas audiences, which helped other nations recognize the sovereignty of Indonesia. In addition, the \"Voice of Free Indonesia\" was also the name of an Indonesian Republican magazine that was marketed at Western correspondents. In 1950, \"Voice of Free Indonesia\" was renamed the \"Voice of Indonesia\".\n\nThe target audience of VOI was recently mentioned as ‘general audience’. Generally, there are three types of audience: Indonesian citizen abroad, Indonesian Diaspora and all the people across the globe.\n\nBefore, VOI serves people abroad in 11-different languages. It has several programmes that broadcast in English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Thai and Indonesian.\n\nUntil 2010, each language broadcasts 2 hours of programming a day with total of 13 hours for the whole language broadcasting. There are four main programs of VOI: News and Information, Rhythm of Archipelago; programme about Indonesian music, Getting to know Indonesia; programme about unique and typical culture of the country, and the Archipelago Sketches; programme about regional autonomy policy that implements throughout the country. These programmes are first produced in Indonesian language and then translated into 11 different languages. The content of all foreign language programs are practically the same.\n\nSince 2010, VOI broadcasts 24 hours on internet and 12 hours on SW with only 9525 kHz. The 11785 and 15150 are idle for the time being. In history, VOI broadcasts abroad using short wave frequencies 9525, 11785 and 15150 kHz, which it has used since it first went on the air.\n\nAlthough shortwave broadcasting is the main core to deliver its product, VOI also operates a web site. Within the web site, audience may find written news in 11 different languages, as well as live streaming radio service which is started on 1 April 2008. However, the streaming service is not as fully functioned as the shortwave broadcasting.\n\nBut since 2010 audio and video streaming is fully functioned as additional medium of broadcast. VOI uses social media such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter to update information about Indonesia. \nAnd just recently to provide the service to mobile and smartphone user Voice of Indonesia has launched RRI World Service Play and RRI Play on Google Play store.\n\n"}
