{"id": "57572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57572", "title": "Cake", "text": "Cake\n\nCake is a form of sweet dessert that is typically baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of breads, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.\n\nTypical cake ingredients are flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.\n\nCake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur cook may bake a cake.\n\nThe term \"cake\" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word \"kaka\".\n\nThe ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (\"plakous\"), which was derived from the word for \"flat\", πλακόεις (\"plakoeis\"). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts and honey. They also had a cake called \"satura\", which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became \"placenta\" which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.\n\nThe Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil, and cheesecakes using goat's milk. In ancient Rome, basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet and cake-like baked good. Latin poet Ovid refers his and his brother's birthday party and cake in his first book of exile, \"Tristia\".\n\nEarly cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a \"cake\" and \"bread\" were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.\n\nSponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the United States. One company patented a cake-bread mix in order to deal with this economic situation, and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In so doing, cake as it is known today became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.\n\nLater, during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further, marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the 1950s, marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and creativity, had become dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from the war-time labor force, were confined to the domestic sphere, while still exposed to the blossoming consumerism in the US. This inspired psychologist Ernest Dichter to find a solution to the cake mix problem in frosting. Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on cake decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.\n\nEver since, cake in a box has become a staple of supermarkets, and is complemented with frosting in a can.\n\nCakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques. \n\nAlthough clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive. For example, banana bread may be properly considered either a quick bread or a cake.\n\nSome varieties of cake are widely available in the form of cake mixes, wherein some of the ingredients (usually flour, sugar, flavoring, baking powder, and sometimes some form of fat) are premixed, and the cook needs add only a few extra ingredients, usually eggs, water, and sometimes vegetable oil or butter. While the diversity of represented styles is limited, cake mixes do provide an easy and readily available homemade option for cooks who are not accomplished bakers.\n\nCakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended. For example, wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes for first communion, Christmas cakes, Halloween cakes, and Passover plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with matzo meal) are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of \"confarreatio\" originated in the sharing of a cake.\n\nParticular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as stollen or chocolate log (at Christmas), babka and simnel cake (at Easter), or mooncake. There has been a long tradition of decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and mince pies.\n\nA Lancashire Courting Cake is a fruit-filled cake baked by a fiancée for her betrothed. The cake has been described as \"somewhere between a firm sponge – with a greater proportion of flour to fat and eggs than a Victoria sponge cake – and a shortbread base and was proof of the bride-to-be's baking skills\". Traditionally it is a two-layer cake filled and topped with strawberries or raspberries and whipped cream.\n\nCakes are frequently described according to their physical form. Cakes may be small and intended for individual consumption. Larger cakes may be made with the intention of being sliced and served as part of a meal or social function. Common shapes include:\n\nSpecial cake flour with a high starch-to-gluten ratio is made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is strongly bleached, and compared to all-purpose flour, cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture. Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light, and/or bright white, such as angel food cake. However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute can be made by replacing a small percentage of all-purpose flour with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of all-purpose flour. Some recipes explicitly specify or permit all-purpose flour, notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired.\n\nA cake can fall, whereby parts of it sink or flatten, when baked at a temperature that is too low or too hot, when it has been underbaked and when placed in an oven that is too hot at the beginning of the baking process. The use of excessive amounts of sugar, flour, fat or leavening can also cause a cake to fall. A cake can also fall when subjected to cool air that enters an oven when the oven door is opened during the cooking process.\n\nA finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with icing, or frosting, and toppings such as sprinkles, which are also known as \"jimmies\" in certain parts of the United States and \"hundreds and thousands\" in the United Kingdom. Frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as vanilla extract or cocoa powder. Some decorators use a rolled fondant icing. Commercial bakeries tend to use lard for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles. This makes the icing light and spreadable. Home bakers either use lard, butter, margarine, or some combination thereof. Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with food coloring. In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public. These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.\n\nSpecial tools are needed for more complex cake decorating, such as piping bags and various piping tips, syringes and embossing mats. To use a piping bag or syringe, a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler. The bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored. Using different piping tips and various techniques, a cake decorator can make many different designs. Basic decorating tips include open star, closed star, basketweave, round, drop flower, leaf, multi, petal, and specialty tips. An embossing mat is used to create embossed effects. A cake turntable that cakes are spun upon may be used in cake decoration.\n\nRoyal icing, marzipan (or a less sweet version, known as almond paste), fondant icing\n(also known as sugarpaste), and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations. Floral sugarcraft or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration. Cakes for special occasions, such as wedding cakes, are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally Madeira cakes, that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste. They are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message, wired sugar flowers, hand-formed fondant flowers, marzipan fruit, piped flowers, or crystallized fruits or flowers such as grapes or violets.\n\n"}

For IBM—Palmisano's employer—this was a successful model because it enabled the company to grow in those markets, understand local customer requirements and cultivate local talent. But it also created redundancy or duplication as each country had its own back-office functions, such as— supply, procurement, finance and human resources.\n\nNow the globally integrated enterprise can locate functions anywhere in the world, based on the right cost, skills and environment, argues Palmisano. For example, IBM now has one supply chain; and this new organizational macrostructure has emerged because everything is connected, and work can move to the place where it is performed cheapest. This approach is made possible due to the rise of globalization, and coming down of many of the barriers that haltered cross-border commerce.\n\nPalmisano mentions the \"Law of Global Integration\", driven by three forces—economics, expertise and openness—without explicitly stating what it is or how it can be verified.\n\nBrad Setser of Roubini Global Economics (RGE) Monitor wrote:\n\n\n"}

Halušky can refer to the dumplings themselves, or to the complete dish.\n\nThe dumplings can be made from dough spread in a thin layer on a wooden cutting board, then cut and scraped off in small pieces which are dropped into boiling water. They can also be made with a special perforated halušky strainer forming small (1/2 × 2–3 cm) irregularly-shaped lumps which drop directly into boiling water as a thinner batter-like dough is pressed through the openings of the strainer.\n\nAlthough recipes vary from region to region, in general flour is mixed with water to form a batter. Finely grated potatoes can be added to the batter. Eggs may be added, but Slovak bryndzové halušky do not contain them. Flour and mashed potatoes are enough to form a batter. After cooking, they are mixed with various ingredients, such as cheese, meat, butter, cabbage, onions, or combinations of these.\n\nBryndzové halušky is a traditional Slovak dish also found in Moravia in the eastern part of the Czech Republic. Strapačky is a similar Slovak dish, where stewed sauerkraut is used instead of bryndza. In Hungary, galuska are often eaten with meat stews, such as goulash or pörkölt.\n\nIn the United States, most adapted halusky recipes call for egg noodles rather than potato dumplings. Some American cooks include loose, cut, and fried green cabbage (a convergence with strapačky, compelled by simplicity, difficulty in finding bryndza or acceptable substitutes, and access to affordable cabbage in areas with prominent existing Slavic and Germanic immigration).\n\n"}

{"id": "17810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17810", "title": "Liechtenstein", "text": "Liechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein ( ; ), officially the Principality of Liechtenstein (), is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. The principality is a constitutional monarchy headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein.\n\nLiechtenstein is bordered by Switzerland to the west and south and Austria to the east and north. It has an area of just over , the fourth smallest country in Europe and has a population of 37,877. Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Liechtenstein has been known in the past as a billionaire tax haven; however, it is no longer on any blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries (see taxation section).\n\nAn Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mainly mountainous, making it a winter sport destination. The country has a strong financial sector centered in Vaduz. Almost 20,000 people commute to work in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein is a member of the United Nations, the European Free Trade Association, and the Council of Europe, and although not a member of the European Union, the country participates in both the Schengen Area and the European Economic Area. It also has a customs union and a monetary union with Switzerland.\n\nThe oldest traces of human existence in what is now Liechtenstein date back to the Middle Paleolithic era. Neolithic farming settlements were initially founded in the valleys around 5300 BCE.\n\nThe Hallstatt and La Tène cultures flourished during the late Iron Age, from around 450 BCE—possibly under some influence of both the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region were the Helvetii. In 58 BCE, at the Battle of Bibracte, Julius Caesar defeated the Alpine tribes, therefore bringing the region under close control of the Roman Republic. By 15 BCE, Tiberius—destined to be the second Roman emperor—with his brother, Drusus, conquered the entirety of the Alpine area. Liechtenstein was then integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. The area was maintained by the Roman military, who also maintained large legionary camps at Brigantium (Austria), near Lake Constance, and at Magia (Swiss). A Roman road which ran through the territory was also created and maintained by these groups. In 259/60 Brigantium was destroyed by the Alemanni, a Germanic people who settled in the area in around 450 CE.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the Alemanni settled the eastern Swiss plateau by the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps by the end of the 8th century, with Liechtenstein located at the eastern edge of Alemannia. In the 6th century, the entire region became part of the Frankish Empire following Clovis I's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504.\n\nThe area that later became Liechtenstein remained under Frankish hegemony (Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties), until the empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843 CE, following the death of Charlemagne. The territory of present-day Liechtenstein was under the possession of East Francia. It would later be reunified with Middle Francia under the Holy Roman Empire, around 1000 CE. Until about 1100, the predominant language of the area was Romansch, but thereafter German began to gain ground in the territory. In 1300, an Alemannic population—the Walsers, who originated in Valais—entered the region and settled. The mountain village of Triesenberg still preserves features of Walser dialect into the present century.\n\nBy 1200, dominions across the Alpine plateau were controlled by the Houses of Savoy, Zähringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg. Other regions were accorded the Imperial immediacy that granted the empire direct control over the mountain passes. When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264, the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) extended their territory to the eastern Alpine plateau that included the territory of Liechtenstein. This region was enfeoffed to the Counts of Hohenems until the sale to the Liechtenstein dynasty in 1699.\n\nIn 1396 Vaduz (the southern region of Liechtenstein) was raised to the status of \"imperial immediacy\" and as such made subject to the Holy Roman Emperor alone.\n\nThe family, from which the principality takes its name, originally came from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria which they had possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century (and again from 1807 onwards). The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia, and Styria. As these territories were all held in feudal tenure from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the Habsburgs, the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial diet (parliament), the \"Reichstag\". Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nFor this reason, the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as \"unmittelbar\" (immediate) or held without any intermediate feudal tenure, directly from the Holy Roman Emperor. During the early 17th century Karl I of Liechtenstein was made a \"Fürst\" (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor Matthias after siding with him in a political battle. Hans-Adam I was allowed to purchase the minuscule \"Herrschaft\" (\"Lordship\") of Schellenberg and county of Vaduz (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain Emperor.\n\nOn 23 January 1719, after the lands had been purchased, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of \"Fürstentum\" (\"principality\") with the name \"Liechtenstein\" in honour of \"[his] true servant, Anton Florian of Liechtenstein\". It was on this date that Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the Holy Roman Empire. It is a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchase that the Princes of Liechtenstein never visited their new principality for almost 100 years.\n\nBy the early 19th century, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire came under the effective control of France, following the crushing defeat at Austerlitz by Napoleon in 1805. Emperor Francis II abdicated, ending more than 960 years of feudal government. Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the Confederation of the Rhine. This political restructuring had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: the historical imperial, legal, and political institutions had been dissolved. The state ceased to owe an obligation to any feudal lord beyond its borders.\n\nModern publications generally attribute Liechtenstein's sovereignty to these events. Its prince ceased to owe an obligation to any suzerain. From 25 July 1806, when the Confederation of the Rhine was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact, a vassal, of its hegemon, styled \"protector\", the French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the confederation on 19 October 1813.\n\nSoon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the German Confederation (20 June 181524 August 1866), which was presided over by the Emperor of Austria.\n\nIn 1818, Prince Johann I granted the territory a limited constitution. In that same year Prince Aloys became the first member of the House of Liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name. The next visit would not occur until 1842.\n\nDevelopments during the 19th century included:\n\nUntil the end of World War I, Liechtenstein was closely tied first to the Austrian Empire and later to Austria-Hungary; the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the Habsburg territories, and they spent much of their time at their two palaces in Vienna. The economic devastation caused by this war forced the country to conclude a customs and monetary union with its other neighbour, Switzerland.\n\nAt the time of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was argued that Liechtenstein, as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, was no longer bound to the emerging independent state of Austria, since the latter did not consider itself as the legal successor to the empire. This is partly contradicted by the Liechtenstein perception that the dethroned Austro-Hungarian Emperor still maintained an abstract heritage of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn 1929, 75-year-old Prince Franz I succeeded to the throne. Franz had just married Elisabeth von Gutmann, a wealthy woman from Vienna whose father was a Jewish businessman from Moravia. Although Liechtenstein had no official Nazi party, a Nazi sympathy movement arose within its National Union party.\nLocal Liechtenstein Nazis identified Elisabeth as their Jewish \"problem\".\n\nIn March 1938, just after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Prince Franz named as regent his 31-year-old grandnephew and heir-presumptive, Prince Franz Joseph. Franz died in July that year, and Franz Joseph succeeded to the throne. Franz Joseph II first moved to Liechtenstein in 1938, a few days after Austria's annexation.\n\nDuring World War II, Liechtenstein remained officially neutral, looking to neighbouring Switzerland for assistance and guidance, while family treasures from dynastic lands and possessions in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia were taken to Liechtenstein for safekeeping. At the close of the conflict, Czechoslovakia and Poland, acting to seize what they considered to be German possessions, expropriated the entirety of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions. The expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the International Court of Justice) included over of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape), and several family castles and palaces.\n\nIn 2005 it was revealed that Jewish labourers from the Strasshof concentration camp, provided by the \"SS\", had worked on estates in Austria owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House.\n\nCitizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. More recently the diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial post-war Beneš decrees resulted in Liechtenstein not sharing international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009, and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.\n\nLiechtenstein was in dire financial straits following the end of the war in Europe. The Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, including the portrait \"Ginevra de' Benci\" by Leonardo da Vinci, which was purchased by the National Gallery of Art of the United States in 1967 for 5 million ($ million in dollars), then a record price for a painting.\n\nHowever, by the late 1970s, it used its low corporate tax rates to draw many companies to the country, becoming one of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\nLiechtenstein has a constitutional monarch as Head of State, and an elected parliament which enacts the law. It is also a direct democracy, where voters can propose and enact constitutional amendments and legislation independent of the legislature. The Constitution of Liechtenstein was adopted in March 2003, replacing the previous 1921 constitution which had established Liechtenstein as a constitutional monarchy headed by the reigning prince of the Princely House of Liechtenstein. A parliamentary system had been established, although the reigning Prince retained substantial political authority.\n\nThe reigning Prince is the head of state and represents Liechtenstein in its international relations (although Switzerland has taken responsibility for much of Liechtenstein's diplomatic relations). The Prince may veto laws adopted by parliament. The Prince can call referenda, propose new legislation, and dissolve parliament, although dissolution of parliament may be subject to a referendum.\n\nExecutive authority is vested in a collegiate government comprising the head of government (prime minister) and four government councilors (ministers). The head of government and the other ministers are appointed by the Prince upon the proposal and concurrence of parliament, thus reflecting the partisan balance of parliament. The constitution stipulates that at least two members of the government be chosen from each of the two regions. The members of the government are collectively and individually responsible to parliament; parliament may ask the Prince to remove an individual minister or the entire government.\n\nLegislative authority is vested in the unicameral Landtag made up of 25 members elected for maximum four-year terms according to a proportional representation formula. Fifteen members are elected from the \"Oberland\" (Upper Country or region) and ten members are elected from the \"Unterland\" (Lower Country or region). Parties must receive at least 8% of the national vote to win seats in parliament, i.e. enough for 2 seats in the 25-seat legislature. Parliament proposes and approves a government, which is formally appointed by the Prince. Parliament may also pass votes of no confidence in the entire government or individual members.\n\nParliament elects from among its members a \"Landesausschuss\" (National Committee) made up of the president of the parliament and four additional members. The National Committee is charged with performing parliamentary oversight functions. Parliament can call for referenda on proposed legislation. Parliament shares the authority to propose new legislation with the Prince and with the number of citizens required for an initiative referendum.\n\nJudicial authority is vested in the Regional Court at Vaduz, the Princely High Court of Appeal at Vaduz, the Princely Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the State Court. The State Court rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and has five members elected by parliament.\n\nOn 1 July 1984, Liechtenstein became the last country in Europe to grant women the right to vote. The referendum on women's suffrage, in which only men were allowed to participate, passed with 51.3% in favour.\n\nIn a national referendum in March 2003, nearly two-thirds of the electorate voted in support of Hans-Adam II's proposed new constitution to replace the 1921 version. The proposed constitution was criticised by many, including the Council of Europe, as expanding the powers of the monarchy (continuing the power to veto any law, and allowing the Prince to dismiss the government or any minister). The Prince threatened that if the constitution failed, he would, among other things, convert some of the royal property for commercial use and move to Austria. The princely family and the Prince enjoy tremendous public support inside the nation, and the resolution passed with about 64% in favour. A proposal to revoke the Prince's veto powers was rejected by 76% of voters in a 2012 referendum.\n\nFew national constitutions provide a right of secession, but municipalities in Liechtenstein are entitled to secede from the union by majority vote.\n\nIn 2013, Liechtenstein won for the first time a SolarSuperState Prize in the category Solar recognizing the achieved level of the usage of photovoltaics per population within the state territory. The SolarSuperState Association justified this prize with the cumulative installed photovoltaic power of some 290 Watt per capita at the end of 2012. This level placed Liechtenstein second in the world after Germany. Also in 2014, the SolarSuperState Association awarded the second place SolarSuperState Prize in the category Solar to Liechtenstein. In the years 2015 and 2016, Liechtenstein was honored with the first place SolarSuperState Prize in the category Solar because the state had the world's biggest cumulative installed photovoltaic power per population.\n\nLiechtenstein is situated in the Upper Rhine valley of the European Alps and is bordered to the east by Austria, and to the south and west by Switzerland. The entire western border of Liechtenstein is formed by the Rhine. Measured south to north the country is about long. Its highest point, the Grauspitz, is . Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate of Liechtenstein comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.\n\nNew surveys using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at , with borders of . Thus, it was discovered in 2006 that Liechtenstein's borders are longer than previously thought.\n\nLiechtenstein is one of only two doubly landlocked countries in the world—being a landlocked country wholly surrounded by other landlocked countries (the other is Uzbekistan). Liechtenstein is the sixth-smallest independent nation in the world by land area.\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is divided into 11 communes called \"Gemeinden\" (singular \"Gemeinde\"). The \"Gemeinden\" mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them (Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren, Ruggell, and Schellenberg) fall within the electoral district \"Unterland\" (the lower county), and the remainder (Balzers, Planken, Schaan, Triesen, Triesenberg, and Vaduz) within \"Oberland\" (the upper county).\n\nDespite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours.\n\nLiechtenstein participates in a customs union with Switzerland and employs the Swiss franc as the national currency. The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate stood at 1.5%. Currently, there is only one hospital in Liechtenstein, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the CIA World Factbook estimated the gross domestic product (GDP) on a purchasing power parity basis to be $4.978 billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, which is the highest listed for the world.\n\nIndustries include electronics, textiles, precision instruments, metal manufacturing, power tools, anchor bolts, calculators, pharmaceuticals, and food products. Its most recognizable international company and largest employer is Hilti, a manufacturer of direct fastening systems and other high-end power tools. Many cultivated fields and small farms are found both in the south (Oberland, \"upper land\") and north (Unterland, \"lower land\"). Liechtenstein produces wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, dairy products, livestock, and wine. Tourism accounts for a large portion of the country's economy.\n\nThe government of Liechtenstein taxes personal, business income, and principal (wealth). The basic rate of personal income tax is 1.2%. When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%. An additional income tax of 4.3% is levied on all employees under the country's social security programme. This rate is higher for the self-employed, up to a maximum of 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total. The basic tax rate on wealth is 0.06% per annum, and the combined total rate is 0.89%. The tax rate on corporate profits is 12.5%.\n\nLiechtenstein's gift and estate taxes vary depending on the relationship the recipient has to the giver and the amount of the inheritance. The tax ranges between 0.5% and 0.75% for spouses and children and 18% to 27% for non-related recipients. The estate tax is progressive.\n\nLiechtenstein has previously received significant revenues from \"Stiftungen\" (\"foundations\"), which are financial entities created to hide the true owner of nonresident foreigners' financial holdings. The foundation is registered in the name of a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer. This set of laws used to make Liechtenstein a popular tax haven for extremely wealthy individuals and businesses attempting to avoid or evade taxes in their home countries. In recent years, Liechtenstein has displayed a stronger determination to prosecute international money-launderers and has worked to promote the country's image as a legitimate finance center. In February 2008, the country's LGT Bank was implicated in a tax-fraud scandal in Germany, which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government. Crown Prince Alois has accused the German government of trafficking in stolen goods, referring to its $7.3 million purchase of private banking information offered by a former employee of LGT Group. However, the United States Senate's subcommittee on tax haven banks said that the LGT bank, owned by the princely family, and on whose board they serve, \"is a willing partner, and an aider and abettor to clients trying to evade taxes, dodge creditors or defy court orders\".\n\nThe 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair is a series of tax investigations in numerous countries whose governments suspect that some of their citizens have evaded tax obligations by using banks and trusts in Liechtenstein; the affair broke open with the biggest complex of investigations ever initiated for tax evasion in the Federal Republic of Germany. It was also seen as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, then one of the remaining uncooperative tax havens—along with Andorra and Monaco—as identified by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2007. On 27 May 2009 the OECD removed Liechtenstein from the blacklist of uncooperative countries.\n\nIn August 2009, the British government department HM Revenue & Customs agreed with Liechtenstein to start exchanging information. It is believed that up to 5,000 British investors have roughly £3 billion deposited in accounts and trusts in the country.\n\nIn October 2015, the European Union and Liechtenstein signed a tax agreement to ensure the automatic exchange of financial information in case of tax disputes. The collection of data started in 2016, and is another step to bring the principality in line with other European countries with regard to its taxation of private individuals and corporate assets.\n\nPopulation-wise, Liechtenstein is the fourth smallest country of Europe; only Vatican City, San Marino, and Monaco have fewer residents. Its population is primarily Alemannic-speaking, although one third is foreign-born, primarily German speakers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, along with other Swiss, Italians, and Turks. Foreign-born people make up two-thirds of the country's workforce.\n\nLiechtensteiners have an average life expectancy at birth of 80.31 years, subdividing as male: 76.86 years, female: 83.77 years (2011 est.). The infant mortality rate is 4.64 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to recent estimates.\n\nThe official language is German; most speak an Alemannic dialect of German that is highly divergent from Standard German but closely related to those dialects spoken in neighbouring regions such as Switzerland and Vorarlberg, Austria. In Triesenberg, a Walser German dialect promoted by the municipality is spoken. However, Swiss Standard German is understood and spoken by most people within the country.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Liechtenstein, Catholicism is the official state religion of Liechtenstein:\n\nLiechtenstein offers protection to adherents of all religious beliefs, and considers the \"religious interests of the people\" a priority of the government. In Liechtenstein schools, although exceptions are allowed, religious education in Roman Catholicism or Protestantism (either Reformed or Lutheran, or both) is legally required. Tax exemption is granted by the government to religious organizations. According to the Pew Research Center, social conflict caused by religious hostilities is ranked low in Liechtenstein, and so is the amount of government restriction on the practice of religion.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 85.8% of the total population is Christian, of whom 75.9% adhere to the Roman Catholic faith, forming the exempt Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz, while 9.6% are either Protestant, mainly organized in the Evangelical Church in Liechtenstein (a United church, Lutheran & Reformed) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Liechtenstein, or Orthodox, mainly organized in the Christian-Orthodox Church. The largest minority religion is Islam (5.4% of the total population).\n\nThe literacy rate of Liechtenstein is 100%. In 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment report, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranked Liechtenstein's education as the 10th best in the world. In 2012, Liechtenstein had the highest PISA-scores of any European country.\n\nWithin Liechtenstein, there are four main centres for higher education:\n\nThere are nine public high schools in the country. These include:\n\nThere are about of paved roadway within Liechtenstein, with of marked bicycle paths.\nA railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The country's railways are administered by the Austrian Federal Railways as part of the route between Feldkirch, Austria, and Buchs, Switzerland. Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg tariff region.\n\nThere are four railway stations in Liechtenstein, namely Schaan-Vaduz, Forst Hilti, and Nendeln and Schaanwald, served by an irregularly stopping train service between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by Austrian Federal Railways. While EuroCity and other long-distance international trains also travel along the route, they do not normally call at the stations within the borders of Liechtenstein.\n\nLiechtenstein Bus is a subsidiary of the Swiss Postbus system, but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at Buchs and at Sargans. Buses also run to the Austrian town of Feldkirch.\n\nLiechtenstein has no airport. The nearest large airport is Zürich Airport near Zürich, Switzerland (130 km/80 mi by road). The nearest small airport is St. Gallen Airport (50 km/30 mi). Friedrichshafen Airport also provides access to Liechtenstein, as it is 85 km away. Balzers Heliport is available for chartered helicopter flights.\n\nAs a result of its small size, Liechtenstein has been strongly affected by external cultural influences, most notably those originating in the southern German-speaking areas of Europe, including Austria, Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, Switzerland, and specifically Tirol and Vorarlberg. The \"Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein\" plays a role in preserving the culture and history of the country.\n\nThe largest museum is the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo, and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a \"black box\" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein.\n\nThe other important museum is the Liechtenstein National Museum (\"Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum\") showing permanent exhibition on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There is also a stamp museum, ski museum, and a 500-year-old Rural Lifestyle Museum.\n\nThe Liechtenstein State Library is the library that has legal deposit for all books published in the country.\n\nThe most famous historical sites are Vaduz Castle, Gutenberg Castle, the Red House and the ruins of Schellenberg.\n\nThe Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna.\n\nOn the country's national holiday all subjects are invited to the castle of the head of state. A significant portion of the population attends the national celebration at the castle where speeches are made and complimentary beer is served.\n\nMusic and theatre are an important part of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days, and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society, which play in two main theatres.\n\nThe primary internet service provider and mobile network operator of Liechtenstein is Telecom Liechtenstein, located in Schaan. There is only one television channel in the country, the private channel 1FLTV created in 2008. At the moment, 1FLTV is not a member of the European Broadcasting Union. L-Radio, which was established in 2004, serves as Liechtenstein's radio station and is based in Triesen. L-Radio has a listener base of 50,000 and began as \"air Radio Liechtenstein\" on 15 October 1938. Liechtenstein also has two major newspapers; \"Liechtensteiner Volksblatt\" and \"Liechtensteiner Vaterland\". The primary multimedia company in Liechtenstein is ManaMedia, located in Vaduz.\n\nAmateur radio is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own ITU prefix. It uses Switzerland's callsign prefixes (typically \"HB\") followed by a zero.\n\nLiechtenstein football teams play in the Swiss football leagues. The Liechtenstein Football Cup allows access for one Liechtenstein team each year to the UEFA Europa League; FC Vaduz, a team playing in the Swiss Challenge League, the second division in Swiss football, is the most successful team in the Cup, and scored their greatest success in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1996 when they drew with and defeated the Latvian team FC Universitate Riga by 1–1 and 4–2, to go on to a lucrative fixture against Paris Saint-Germain F.C., which they lost 0–3 and 0–4.\n\nThe Liechtenstein national football team is regarded as an easy target for any team drawn against them; this was the basis for a book about Liechtenstein's unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup by British author, Charlie Connelly. In one surprising week during autumn 2004, however, the team managed a 2–2 draw with Portugal, who only a few months earlier had been the losing finalists in the European Championships. Four days later, the Liechtenstein team traveled to Luxembourg, where they defeated the home team 4–0 in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match. In the qualification stage of the European Championship 2008, Liechtenstein beat Latvia 1–0, a result which prompted the resignation of the Latvian coach. They went on to beat Iceland 3–0 on 17 October 2007, which is considered one of the most dramatic losses of the Icelandic national football team. On 7 September 2010, they came within seconds of a 1–1 draw against Scotland in Glasgow, having led 1–0 earlier in the second half, but Liechtenstein lost 2–1 thanks to a goal by Stephen McManus in the 97th minute. On 3 June 2011, Liechtenstein defeated Lithuania 2–0. On 15 November 2014, Liechtenstein defeated Moldova 0–1 with Franz Burgmeier's late free kick goal in Chișinău.\n\nAs an alpine country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as downhill skiing: the country's single ski area is Malbun. Hanni Wenzel won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980 Winter Olympics (she won bronze in 1976), her brother Andreas won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the giant slalom event, and her daughter Tina Weirather won a bronze medal in 2018 in the Super-G. With ten medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation. It is the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are Marco Büchel, Willi Frommelt, Paul Frommelt and Ursula Konzett. Liechtenstein is also the home country of Stephanie Vogt, a professional women's tennis player.\n\nLiechtenstein competes in the Switzerland U16 Cup Tournament, which offers young players an opportunity to play against top football clubs.\n\nThe Liechtenstein National Police is responsible for keeping order within the country. It consists of 87 field officers and 38 civilian staff, totaling 125 employees. All officers are equipped with small arms. The country has one of the world's lowest crime rates. Liechtenstein's prison holds few, if any, inmates, and those with sentences over two years are transferred to Austrian jurisdiction. The Liechtenstein National Police maintains a trilateral treaty with Austria and Switzerland that enables close cross-border cooperation among the police forces of the three countries.\n\nLiechtenstein follows a policy of neutrality and is one of the few countries in the world that maintain no military. The army was abolished soon after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, in which Liechtenstein fielded an army of 80 men, although they were not involved in any fighting. The demise of the German Confederation in that war freed Liechtenstein from its international obligation to maintain an army, and parliament seized this opportunity and refused to provide funding for one. The Prince objected, as such a move would leave the country defenceless, but relented on 12 February 1868 and disbanded the force. The last soldier to serve under the colors of Liechtenstein died in 1939 at age 95.\nDuring the 1980s the Swiss army fired off shells during an exercise and mistakenly burned a patch of forest inside Liechtenstein. The incident was said to have been resolved \"over a case of white wine\".\n\nIn March 2007, a 170-person Swiss infantry unit got lost during a training exercise and inadvertently crossed into Liechtenstein. The accidental invasion ended when the unit realized their mistake and turned back. The Swiss army later informed Liechtenstein of the incursion and offered official apologies, to which an internal ministry spokesperson responded, \"No problem, these things happen.\"\n\n\n"}

Her areas of expertise are in climate change and paleoclimatology, including the climate of Antarctica, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and impacts on the climate of Australia.\n\nAbram grew up in Wangi Wangi, New South Wales, Australia. She completed her secondary education at Toronto High School.\n\nAbram completed a Bachelor of Science (Advanced) degree at the University of Sydney in 2000. This degree included an honours project studying the Holocene climate history of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. She graduated from her undergraduate studies with the University Medal.\n\nAbram then commenced her PhD through the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University in 2004. During this time she was the recipient of the John Conrad Jaeger Scholarship. Her postgraduate studies earned her the Mervyn and Kaitalin Paterson Fellowship and the Robert Hill Memorial Prize for excellence in scientific research, communication and outreach.\n\nAbram’s research expertise spans Antarctic and tropical climate systems. She uses Porites corals, Speleothem samples from caves and Ice core samples to reconstruct climate changes in the past to provide a crucial long-term perspective on recent and projected future climate changes. Abram's publication record includes first-author papers across the scientific journals of \"Science\", \"Nature\", \"Nature Geoscience\", and \"Nature Climate Change\".\n\nBetween 2004 and 2011 Abram was an ice core scientist with the British Antarctic Survey. Here, she was part of the team that drilled the James Ross Island ice core in 2008. Dr Abram’s discoveries from this project included that the Antarctic Peninsula is warming very rapidly, resulting in a 10-fold increase summer ice melt in that area of Antarctica.\n\nAbram was part of the chemical analysis team of the NEEM ice core project in Northern Greenland in 2010 which sought to retrieve ice from the Eemian inter-glacial period to discover what Earth would be like under the effects of global warming. In the summer of 2013/14 Abram was also a member of the international team that drilled the Aurora Basin ice core in East Antarctica.\n\nIn 2014 Abram demonstrated that the southward shift in westerly winds caused by greenhouse gas emissions has moved these winds to their most southward position in at least the last 1,000 years causing a marked reduction in rainfall in southern Australia.\n\nAbram is a dedicated science communicator, and her work has been covered by international print, online, radio and television media outlets. She has also been interviewed for documentaries including the BBC \"Men of Rock\" series hosted by Iain Stewart, and for the Natural History Museum exhibition of Robert Scott’s final expedition.\n\nIn 2013, Abram wrote an invited essay on Antarctic ice melt and sea level rise for \"The Curious Country\", a book about the importance of Australian science published for the Office of the Chief Scientist (Australia). This work was later selected for republication in the anthology of Best Australian Science Writing 2014.\n\nAbram is a mother of three children and has a strong interest in encouraging other women in scientific careers. Her work as an Antarctic scientist and mother was the subject of a profile piece for “I don’t know how she does it” in the Times Magazine, London.\n\nIn 2011, Abram returned to Australia after being awarded a QEII fellowship through the Australian Research Council. In 2014 Abram received a second ARC Discovery Grant to continue her groundbreaking work studying the effects of tropical and Antarctic climate change on Australia’s rainfall patterns. Abram was the 2015 recipient of the Dorothy Hill award from the Australian Academy of Science which recognises excellence in Earth Sciences research by a woman under the age of 40.\n\nAbram is a Co-Editor-in-Chief for the open-access journal \"Climate of the Past\" since 2010, journal is associated with the European Geosciences Union.\n\n"}

The citizen was called proxenos (πρόξενος; plural: \"proxenoi\" or \"proxeni\", \"instead of a foreigner\") or proxeinos (πρόξεινος). The proxeny decrees, which amount to letters of patent and resolutions of appreciation were issued by one state to a citizen of another for service as proxenos, a kind of honorary consul looking after the interests of the other state's citizens. A cliché phrase is \"euergetes (benefactor) and proxenos\" (πρόξεινος τε ειη και ευεργέτης).\n\nA proxenos would use whatever influence he had in his own city to promote policies of friendship or alliance with the city he voluntarily represented. For example, Cimon was Sparta's proxenos at Athens and during his period of prominence in Athenian politics, previous to the outbreak of the First Peloponnesian War, he strongly advocated a policy of cooperation between the two states. Cimon was known to be so fond of Sparta that he named one of his sons Lacedaemonius.\nBeing another city's proxenos did not preclude taking part in war against that city, should it break out – since the proxenos' ultimate loyalty was to his own city. However, a proxenos would naturally try his best to prevent such a war from breaking out and to compose whatever differences were threatening to cause it. And once peace negotiations were on the way, a proxenos' contacts and goodwill in the enemy city could be profitably used by his city.\n\nThe position of proxenos for a particular city was often hereditary in a particular family. \n\n\n"}

Descharnes (January 1, 1926—February 15, 2014) was a French photographer, filmmaker, and author. He served as Salvador Dali's secretary and, after the painter's death, administrator of his copyright. He is the author of several books on Dali.\n\nDescharnes was born in Nevers on January 1, 1926. In 1950, he met Dali on a ship while he was the photographer. The two formed a close bond, and collaborated on the experimental film \"L'Aventure prodigieuse de la dentellière et du rhinocéros\", which was never released. He became Dali's personal secretary in 1981, and rescued him from a fire at his apartment in 1984. Descharnes collected over 60,000 negatives of Dali's daily life, a fraction of which Descharnes infrequenty exhibited in art museums.\n\nFor over 40 years, he fought to protect's Dali's legacy from forgeries and fakes. He wrote several reference books on the man's life and work. Descharnes was named a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2011. He died at the age of 88 at his home in Indre-et-Loire on February 18, 2014.\n\nDescharnes is regarded by some Dali experts as a controversial figure. His claims regarding the authenticity of some of Dali's late works have been questioned, as Ian Gibson notes in his definitive biography of the painter,\"The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali.\" Of far greater concern was Descharnes's role in persuading the elderly, infirm painter to transfer his copyright, in 1986, for a period of 20 years to a company managed by Descharnes. Gibson writes, \"The contract was prepared by [the Madrid lawyer] Miguel Domenech, who has said that at the time Dali, he and [Dali's friend, Antoni] Pitxot were under 'tremendous pressure' from a now power-hungry Descharnes. ... Even when he was well, Dali had never shown any interest in contracts, or any understanding of their small print. ... It is difficult to believe, therefore, that...he could have grasped its exact nature or its potential consequences. The painter, moreover, was in very poor physical condition at this time.\" Gibson, who calls Descharnes \"a very controversial figure in Spain,\" notes in a 1997 episode of the TV show \"Omnibus,\" about Dali and his work, that \"many of Dali's associates are still unhappy about this situation,\" by which he means the circumstances surrounding the signing of the contract in which Dali assigned his copyright to Descharnes's company.\n\n"}

It is a constituent of the FTSE Fledgling Index. Originally formed as Scottish Television, the ITV licence holder for central Scotland, the company changed its name to Scottish Media Group in 1996 and acquired the licence holder for Northern Scotland, Grampian Television, in 1997. The Scottish and Grampian channels were rebranded as STV in 2006.\n\nScottish Television began broadcasting in August 1957. The company changed its name to Scottish Media Group in 1996 when it acquired Caledonian Publishing, owners of Glasgow-based newspapers \"The Herald\" and \"Evening Times\" (both of which have since been sold). It went on to acquire the ITV licence holder for Northern Scotland, Grampian Television in June 1997. In August 1997 the company acquired a 15% stake in UTV, Northern Ireland. In 1999 it launched a new Sunday broadsheet newspaper, the \"Sunday Herald\". The company was renamed \"SMG plc\" in 2000, by which time it had expanded further through the acquisitions of Primesight (outdoor advertising), Pearl & Dean and Ginger Media Group, which included Ginger Television and the original Virgin Radio UK radio station. Talks were also held which could have led to Border Television and Ulster Television being bought, but they came to nothing.\n\nOn 24 March 1999, Mirror Group sold its 18.6% stake in SMG to Granada. During the summer, the STV Group held talks about buying out the other shareholders in GMTV, with Disney believed to be keen on the idea; many city observers believed this was a defensive move to fend off a takeover bid from Granada. By September an agreement had been reached to acquire Guardian Media Group's 15% stake in GMTV for £20 million, but both Carlton and Granada objected to the deal. Guardian Media Group eventually sold its stake for £18m in January 2000, but STV Group only acquired 5% with the remaining 10% going to Carlton and Granada, resulting in each of STV Group, Carlton, Granada and Disney holding 25% of GMTV.\n\nIn September 1999, the company acquired a 37.4% stake in Heart of Midlothian F.C. for £8 million. A few days later the company unveiled its interim results with its pre-tax profits up 2 per cent to £24 million on a turnover of £111.2 million.\n\nIn December 2000, the group acquired a 14.9% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings, in anticipation of a relaxation of radio ownership rules and within four months increased this to 27.7%. By 2004 the company sold their 27.8% stake in Scottish Radio Holdings to EMAP for £90 million in anticipation of consolidation in the radio market.\n\nFlextech owner Telewest sold its 16.9% stake in STV Group to an investment bank for £45 million as part of their plan to raise funds to help clear off debt. Throughout 2003/2004 rumours appeared about the company being broken up, with its ITV interests being sold off in an attempt to wipe out its £380m debt and boost its balance sheet. However, the group instead sold the Herald newspapers and its stake in Scottish Radio Holdings. In late 2003 Northern Ireland's UTV, in partnership with venture capital group 3i and Scottish Radio Holdings, sought to acquire SMG for £400 million, but they withdrew the offer as they felt the share price was too high.\n\nIn September 2004, ITV plc purchased STV Group's 25% stake in GMTV for £31 million, after being given the go ahead from the Office of Fair Trading, despite advertiser fears it could give ITV influence over pricing. SMG said \"SMG are pulling out of GMTV because it did not want to hold a minority interest in someone else's media business\".\n\nAndrew Flanagan unexpectedly resigned as chief executive in July 2006. Although he helped create the company since 1998, his spell in charge will be remembered by many in the television industry as a period which saw a dramatic decline in the amount of programmes made by the company for transmission within Scotland alone.\n\nRob Woodward became the new chief executive in 2007, and started a major reconstruction of the group by instigating a sell-off of poorly performing assets, starting with Primesight being sold for £62m to a private equity firm. SMG said in a statement that the price GMT Communications Partners paid represented a \"clear uplift\" on offers previously received for Primesight. Primesight have been prosecuted a number of times for the display of advertisements without consent which is an offence under UK Planning Acts. The lack of consent for many of Primesight's displays is said to have reduced the selling price by up to £30 million.\n\nFurther major changes occurred when STV Group sold Virgin Radio to a group led by The Times of India on 31 May 2008.\n\nIn June 2008, SMG plc announced plans to change its name to \"STV Group plc\". The company said the proposed name change was to highlight its renewed focus on television, encompassing the STV Central and STV North franchises, as well as the company's TV production business.\n\nThis name change was approved at an extraordinary general meeting in September 2008, along with a new deal resulting in Pearl & Dean handling advertising for Showcase Cinemas, which meant that the Pearl & Dean titles would appear in just under half of UK cinema sites. The new \"STV Group\" branding was introduced on 1 October 2008.\n\nBy 2010 the group had sold off all non-television assets, including selling cinema advertising company Pearl & Dean for £1 to Image Ltd, a newly formed company backed by Empire Cinemas director Thomas Anderson, with STV still recouping £9.1m from the business due to a 2010 payment from Vue Cinemas. This action helped reduce the group's debt and allowed it to concentrate on its core television businesses. As a result of this, STV Group largely reverted to its Scottish Television plc days, but with the addition of the former Grampian Television and Ginger Productions businesses (the latter retained from the Ginger Media acquisition).\n\nIn September 2006, STV Group (then SMG) officially rejected a merger offer from Northern Irish ITV franchise holder UTV. The merger approach would have given SMG shareholders a 52% stake in the combined company. The Scottish group said its board had examined a revised merger proposal from UTV, but did not believe it reflected the value of the company.\n\nIn 2006 ITV plc considered making an offer for STV Group, according to \"The Mail on Sunday\". The newspaper quoted an ITV source as saying John Cresswell, acting chief executive at the broadcaster, was most interested in the group's television franchises, but that any deal would have been for the whole group. SMG warned that its 2006 profit would be materially behind expectations, sending its shares down more than a quarter in value to a 15-year low.\n\nOn 10 January 2007, SMG and UTV agreed details of a merger, including a revised share split between the two. UTV would own 54% of the group, with SMG owning the remaining 46%.\n\nThis merger was finally rejected at the end of February 2007, and a new board and management team were introduced at SMG shortly afterwards.\n\nSTV Group plc has had a turbulent relationship with ITV plc and both Carlton and Granada, the predecessor companies that merged to create it. ITV plc owns the ITV franchises in England, Northern Ireland, Wales, Southern Scotland (Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders), the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. ITV plc also operates a number of digital channels and websites under the ITV brand. The company threatened to take legal action over the use of the name 'ITV' because it is the name of the Independent Television network, which STV Central and STV North are both part of. One of the problems facing the group is that ITV is the senior partner when it comes to its two TV stations, since London-based ITV effectively controls most of the scheduling and is also responsible for selling STV's advertising airtime.\n\nIn September 2009, ITV plc announced it was to launch legal proceedings against STV for a claimed unpaid debt of £38 million from network programming contributions, following STV's practice of dropping a number of network programmes on the STV franchise. At the same time, STV claimed it was also following procedures against ITV plc, for up to £40 million owed to STV under its advertising sales agreements.\n\nSTV Group plc owns two Scottish ITV licences: Scottish Television, which covers Central Scotland, and Grampian Television, covering Northern Scotland. On 2 March 2006, it was announced that Scottish Television would revert to using its former brand name of \"STV\", which it previously used from the start of colour broadcasting in 1969 until 30 August 1985, and which the station was still informally known as in parts of Scotland. Scottish Television became known as \"STV Central\". At the same time, Grampian Television would also become known as \"STV North\", with the one main identity of \"STV\" serving the two licences. The rebrand took place on 30 May 2006.\n\nThe former SMG plc ran its own digital channel, S2, throughout the Scottish and Grampian ITV regions. S2, which aired on the Digital Terrestrial platform, was launched on 30 April 1999 and was replaced by ITV2 just over two years later – as part of a deal with ITV Digital – on 27 July 2001.\n\nSky Scottish was a satellite television channel operating on the analogue Sky TV service between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1998. The service was a joint venture between British Sky Broadcasting and SMG. It initially broadcast between 6.00pm and 8.00pm. The channel was closed due to poor ratings.\n\nA high-definition channel, STV HD, launched on 6 June 2010.\n\nOn 11 January 2013, STV were awarded two local TV licences by Ofcom to operate digital terrestrial television channels in Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to 12 years. The two channels, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh, were to be delivered in partnership with Glasgow Caledonian University and Edinburgh Napier University respectively. STV Glasgow launched on 2 June 2014, and STV Edinburgh launched on 12 January 2015. In March 2015, STV were awarded local licences for the Aberdeen, Ayr and Dundee areas. In April 2017, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh were re-branded as STV2. Just over a year later in May 2018, STV announced that it would be closing STV2 on 30 June 2018.\n\nSTV Productions (renamed from SMG Productions on 1 October 2008) forms part of the network television production arm of STV Group plc, producing drama, factual, entertainment and children's output from its bases in Glasgow and London for all UK terrestrial networks as well as key satellite and cable channels.\n\nGinger Productions (founded by the presenter Chris Evans), alongside STV Productions, is part of the network production arm of STV Group plc. Based in Waterhouse Square in London, its output focuses on Entertainment and Factual Entertainment. Ginger was acquired as part of SMG's acquisition of the Ginger Media Group in 1999.\n\nSTV Creative is the company's commercial production division, based in Glasgow.\n\nSolutions is STV's production resources division, providing facilities for studios, outside broadcasts, post-production, corporate events and commercial productions.\n\nThe URL stv.tv is the address of the main website of STV. The website currently offers News, Sport, Weather, Entertainment, Competitions, and STV programme information, and TV listings.\n\nSTV Cities is a Scottish network of hyper-local, community-based websites and mobile apps. Pilot sites were launched in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Edinburgh, Moray and North & South Lanarkshire. In October 2013 STV launched apps, accompanied by a website, for Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow.\n\nSTV Player is the video section of the main stv.tv website. It offers catchup of regular STV programming, along with archive STV programmes and exclusive videos.\n\nSTV Bingo was launched in 2006 and is run in partnership with CashCade.\n\nSTV Group's headquarters in Glasgow are based at Pacific Quay, a development situated next to the River Clyde, in July 2006, alongside BBC Scotland's new studios and the Glasgow Science Centre. STV Group's Aberdeen studios moved to a new purpose-built site in the city's Tullos area in 2003, from their previous location (a converted tram shed), which they occupied since Grampian launched in 1961.\n\nSTV also has studios in Edinburgh, Dundee and Inverness providing regional news coverage in their particular area.\n"}

It corresponds to the notion and practice of daylight saving time to be found in many other parts of the world.\n\nEuropean Summer Time begins at 01:00 UTC/WET (02:00 CET, 03:00 EET) on the last Sunday in March and ends at 01:00 UTC (02:00 WEST, 03:00 CEST, 04:00 EEST) on the last Sunday in October each year; i.e. the change is made at the same absolute time across all time zones. European Union Directive 2000/84/EC makes summer time mandatory for EU member states (except overseas territories), though a proposal to repeal this directive and require member states to observe (their own choice of) an unchanging time year-round, is currently going through the legislative process.\n\nSummer Time lasts, depending upon the calendar year, for either 30 or 31 weeks of the year.\n\nSummer Time was first introduced during the First World War. However, most countries discontinued the practice after the war. It was then restarted in various countries during the Second World War and its immediate aftermath. Again it was widely cancelled by the 1950s, but reintroduced in isolated cases until the late 1960s, when the energy crisis began to prompt policymakers to reintroduce Summer Time across the continent. It has remained in place in most European countries since then.\n\nHistorically the countries of Europe had different practices for observing Summer Time, but this hindered coordination of transport, communications and movements. Starting in 1981 the European Commission began issuing directives requiring member states to legislate harmonised start and end dates for Summer Time.\n\nSince 1981 each directive has specified a transition time of 01:00 UTC and a start date of the last Sunday in March, but the end dates have differed. Successive Directives laid down two dates for the end: one on the last Sunday in September applied by the continental Member States, and the other on the fourth Sunday in October for the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 1996 the end date was changed to the fourth Sunday in October for all countries. In 1998 the end date was changed to the last Sunday in October; this happened to be the same as the previous rule for 1996 and 1997. The ninth directive, Directive 2000/84/EC, currently (2018) in force, specifies this rule.\n\nThere were proposals in 2015 and 2016 from members of the European Parliament to abolish summer time observance, but the European Commission did not at that time put forward proposals to be considered, saying it had not found conclusive evidence in favour of a change, and member states were divided. It did however note that a cost would be incurred if harmonisation between member states' summer time rules was lost. In 2017 the Finnish and Lithuanian parliaments both voted in favour of proposals calling on the EU to reconsider daylight saving, with similar criticism from Poland and Sweden. The European Commission at the time was reviewing the practice.\n\nOn 8 February 2018, the European Parliament voted to ask the European Commission to re-evaluate DST in Europe. After a web survey showing high support for not switching clocks twice annually, on 12 September 2018 the European Commission decided to propose that an end be put to seasonal clock changes (repealing Directive 2000/84/EC). In order for this to be valid, the European Union legislative procedure must be followed, mainly that the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament must both approve the proposal.\n\nUnder the proposal, member countries are expected to decide by 31 March 2019 whether they wish to retain their current winter time year round in which case they would change clocks for the last time in October 2019, or their current summer time in which case the last change would be in March 2019. This is however considered a fairly tight timescale by many. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which coordinates changes to the time zone database used by most computers and smartphones, notes that \"With less than a year's notice there is a good chance that some computer-based clocks will operate incorrectly after the change, due to delays in propagating updates to software and data.\" The airline industry points out the complexity of revising all airline schedules, particularly in terms of ensuring slot availability on flights outside the EU, and recommends keeping the status quo or deferring the change until at least 2021. An informal meeting of EU transport ministers on 29 October 2018 suggested that many member states would not support the \"unrealistic\" timetable and that implementation could be pushed back to 2021.\n\nDiscussions have shown support for year-round \"winter time\" in e.g. Denmark, the Netherlands (UTC+1) and Finland (UTC+2) while permanent summer time was supported in Portugal (UTC+1), Poland (UTC+2) and Cyprus (UTC+3). Spanish opinion is split on the matter; the mainland largely favours shifting to UTC, while the Balearic islands would prefer to remain on UTC+1 and the Canary islands on UTC-1. The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU before the reform becomes effective; any new EU directive would apply during the transition period (if any) but thereafter the UK could choose to make its own arrangements. If the UK were thus to continue observing summer/winter time, Northern Ireland would have a one-hour time difference for half the year either with the rest of Ireland or with the rest of the UK, adding a further complication to the Irish border question. The Irish government is to hold a public consultation on the EU proposal;\n, the UK Government \"has no plans\" to end daylight saving.\n\nEuropean Summer Time begins (clocks go forward) at 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday in March, and ends (clocks go back) at 01:00 UTC on the last Sunday in October:\nA formula which can be used to calculate the beginning of European Summer Time is:\n\nSunday (31 − ((((5 × \"y\") ÷ 4) + 4) mod 7)) March at 01:00 UTC\n\nThe corresponding formula for the end of European Summer Time is:\n\nSunday (31 − ((((5 × \"y\") ÷ 4) + 1) mod 7)) October at 01:00 UTC\n\nwhere \"y\" is the year, and \"a\" mod \"b\" is \"b\" times the fractional part of \"a\"/\"b\". These formulae are valid until 2099.\n\n\"Double Summer Time\" (two hours ahead of local winter time) has been observed on some occasions, notably in 1921, 1941-45 and 1947. See:\n\nThere are four countries that do not use summer time, but keep the same time all year.\n\nSome may be thought of as using \"permanent\" summer time, since they use time zones allocated to regions further east than themselves. Belarus explicitly decided to stay permanently on (what it formerly called) summer time after 2011.\n\nSpain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands may also be thought of as observing \"summer time\" throughout the winter, and \"double-summer time\" during summer, because of their position to the west of the central European time zone.\n\n\nIn most of Europe, the word \"Summer\" is added to the name of each European time zone during this period: thus, in the time zone, Central European Time becomes Central European Summer Time ().\nAustria used summer time in 1916–1918, 1920, 1940–1948 (as part of Nazi Germany between 1940–1945) and since 1980. \nAustria-Hungary used summer time during World War I in 1916, 1917 and 1918, in line with the German Empire.\nSummer time was introduced in Bulgaria in 1979 by a regulation of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers. Bulgaria observes the European Union rules for summer time.\nIn the Kingdom of Bohemia summer time was used for three seasons during World War I, from 1916 to 1918, while part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nDuring World War II, when the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia became a de facto part of Nazi Germany, summer time was used from 1940. In 1940/1941 and 1941/1942, the summer time was kept continuously even during the winter. \n\nCzech Republic continued to use summer time after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993.\nCzechoslovakia used summer time from 1945 to 1949 and from 1979 to 1992. In winter 1946/1947 (from 1 December to 23 February), winter time (CET−01:00) was used.\nSummer time has been observed in Denmark since 1980. A national association against summer time (Landsforeningen mod Sommertid) exists, which celebrated the EU commission preliminary decision in August 2018.\nIn Estonia summer time was not used in 1989–1996 and 2000–2001. It was used under Soviet rule in 1981–1988.\nThe Faroe Islands observes summer time since 1981. The islands has never been part of the EU, so the decision to observe summer time was its own.\nIn Finland, summer time has been used on a regular basis since 1981.\n\nA citizens' initiative to abolish daylight saving time was signed by 70,000 Finnish citizens. It was presented to the Finnish parliament in June 2017.\n\nFrom 1923 until the Second World War, France and Monaco observed summer time from the last Saturday in March until the first Saturday in October. During the Second World War France also observed summer time. However, after the war the practice was abandoned (since the country changed time zones instituting \"de facto\" permanent summer time). In 1975, summer time was reimplemented because of the oil crisis.\n\nSince GMT (now UTC) is France's \"natural\" time zone, its use of UTC+1 in winter can be seen as a form of daylight saving time, while its use of Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) in summer can be seen as a form of \"double summer time\".\n\nFrance and Monaco follow EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.\nSummer time was first introduced during World War I by the German Empire from 1916 to 1918. After the end of the war and the proclamation of the Weimar Republic in November 1918, summer time ceased to be observed. Summer time was reintroduced in 1940, during World War II, to try to save energy for the war economy. After the defeat of Germany, summer time was retained by the occupation powers. In 1945, Berlin and the Soviet Occupation Zone even observed Central European Midsummer Time (\"Mitteleuropäische Hochsommerzeit\", \"MEHSZ\"; ): in 1947, all of Germany switched to midsummer time from 11 May to 29 June. After the Federal Republic (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) were established in 1949, summer time again ceased to be observed in 1950.\n\nIn 1978, West Germany decided to reintroduce summer time, following the example set by several neighbouring states in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. However, it only came into effect in 1980, after West and East Germany reached an agreement to observe summer time simultaneously from the last Sunday in March (02:00 CET) to the last Sunday in September (03:00 CEST). Thus both German states observed the same time until the German reunification in 1990, after which the reunified Germany retained the laws and thus also the Time Act (\"Zeitgesetz\") of West Germany.\n\nAfter 1980, West and East Germany; since 1991 reunified Germany: Central European Summer Time.\n\nBüsingen am Hochrhein, a small exclave, entirely surrounded by Swiss territory, did not implement summer time in 1980 but observed the same time as Switzerland; thus there was a one hour time difference between this village and the rest of Germany. The zone Europe/Busingen was created in the 2013a release of the tz database, because since the Unix time epoch in 1970, Büsingen am Hochrhein has shared clocks with Zurich.\n\nGermany follows the EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.\n\nGreenland observes Summer Time simultaneously with Europe. Summer Time thus begins at 00:00 East Greenland Time on Sunday, and 22:00 West Greenland Time on Saturday, and ends at 01:00 EGST on Sunday and 23:00 WGST on Saturday. It was introduced in 1980 when Greenland was legally a part of Denmark without local rule. The most other EU Overseas countries and territories do not observe summer time. Exceptions, based on company decisions, are the northeastern coast around Danmarkshavn (UTC year-round) for Thule Air Base (which follows Atlantic Time and observes in accordance with US and Canadian rules)\nSummer time was first introduced in Hungary in 1916, and it was observed until 1919. After that, summer time was in use between 1941–1949 and 1954–1957. Summer time has been in use again since 1980 and follows EU rules.\nIceland uses UTC but has not used summer time since April 1968. From 1908 to 1968 Iceland used UTC−1. Summer time was used in 1917-1919, 1921 and 1939-1967.\n\nIn Ireland, Summer Time, known as Irish Standard Time (IST) is observed during Summer (March to October). IST is sometimes mistaken for \"Irish Summer Time\", though this is incorrect.\n\nSummer time is known as \"ora legale\" (literally \"legal hour\", referencing the fact that it's mandated by law) in Italy, and it has been adopted and abolished several times: it was observed from 1916 to 1920 and between 1944 and 1948. A law was approved in 1965 that took effect the following year, and made the application of summer time mandatory in the whole country. Since 1996, it has been coordinated with the European Union. San Marino and Vatican City State share land borders solely with Italy and observe the same time as in Italy.\nIn Norway, summer time was observed in 1916, 1940–45, and 1959-65. The arrangement was controversial, and in 1965 the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) voted to discontinue the practice. Their neighbour, Sweden, did not use it.\n\nHowever, in 1980 summer time was reintroduced (together with Sweden and Denmark), and since at least 2002 Norway has followed the European Union in this matter.\nIn Poland, \"the summer time\" was observed in the following years:\nIn the years 1979 - 1995 the last day of summer time was the last Saturday of September. In 1996 it was changed to the last Saturday of October, to synchronise with other countries of the EU.\nIn Portugal, summer time (locally known by \"Hora de Verão\") was introduced in 1916. In the years 1922, 1923, 1925, 1930, 1933 and from 1967 to 1975 summer time was not applied.\nFor many years the official time in the Madeira Islands was one hour earlier than that in Lisbon, and the Azores Islands were two hours behind.\nToday, in the Madeira Islands the official time is the same as that of Lisbon, and in the Azores Islands it is one hour behind Lisbon. The start and end dates for summer time in Portugal follow the pattern in the rest of the EU: the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.\nSummer time in Romania (locally known by \"Ora de Vară\") was originally introduced in 1932 (between 22 May and 2 October). Between 1933 and 1940 summer time started on the first Sunday in April and ended on the first Sunday in October. Summer time was abandoned in 1941 and reintroduced in 1979. Until 1996, with few exceptions, summer time started at the end of March and ended at the end of September. Since 1997, it has started in the last Sunday in March and ended on the last Sunday in October, in accordance with European Union rules.\n\nA decree of the Russian Provisional Government introduced summer time () in Russia on 30 June 1917, and clocks moved one hour forward. A decree of the Soviet government led to the abandonment of this system five months later: clocks moved one hour back again on 28 December.\n\nFrom 1930, Decree time had the effect of imposing year-round time-zone advances in the Soviet Union.\n\nA decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR reintroduced summer time in the USSR (Moscow Summer Time, for example) on 1 April 1981, and its practice continued into post-Soviet times until 2011. The changeover dates in Russia were the same as for other European countries, but clocks were moved forward or back at 02:00 local time in all zones. Thus in Moscow (local time = UTC+3 in winter, UTC+4 in summer), summer time commenced at 02:00 UTC on the day before the last Sunday in March, and ended at 03:00 UTC on the day before the last Sunday in October. (Note that \"day before the last Sunday\" is not the same as \"the last Saturday\" in a month where the last day is a Saturday.)\nOn 8 February 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced cancellation of biannual clock changes in Russia in favor of a permanent switch to summer time. An hour was added in March 2011 for the last time, and clocks did not move back again. At the same time some of Russia's time zones were consolidated. After this reform many Russian cities had a \"standard time\" two hours more than would be suggested by their \"astronomical time\" (because the original standard time was already ahead of astronomical time in many areas).\n\nDuring his 2012 election campaign, Vladimir Putin proposed re-introducing summer time, as some workers had complained about not seeing any daylight during the winter, since the sun had not risen when they went to work. According to a report in the \"International Herald Tribune\", Russian citizens remembered the winter of 2011-12 as the \"darkest winter on record\" as a result of the time change. However, Putin later said it would be up to then Prime Minister Medvedev's cabinet to decide how to proceed with a seasonal time shift, and it decided to stay with the 2011 policy.\n\nOn 26 October 2014 Russia permanently returned to \"winter\" time.\nSlovakia used summer time (locally known as \"Letný čas\") in 1916, 1917 and 1918, as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, then in the early 1940s, as part of Nazi Germany and annually since 1979, as part of Czechoslovakia. \n\nAfter several years, Slovakia established the rule that summer time begins in the last weekend of March (during the night from Saturday to Sunday) and ends in the last weekend of September. \n\nAfter dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, Slovakia continued to use summer time. Since 1996, summer time has been prolonged about one month so it lasts until the last weekend in October, in accordance with European Union rules.\nSummer time in Slovenia (locally known as \"Poletni čas\") was introduced on 16 November 1982 when it was one of the Yugoslavia republics. Same law was valid until 1996 when the end of summer time was changed from first Sunday in October to last Sunday in October. In 2006, the European Union standard was adopted and is still used today.\nIn Sweden summer time was originally introduced on 15 May 1916. It proved unpopular, and on 30 September in the same year, Sweden returned to year-round standard time. This continued for more than half a century.\n\nOn 6 April 1980, Sweden again introduced summer time, and since then summer time has been observed every summer in Sweden. Except for the introduction year 1980, summer time has always started on the last Sunday in March. It ended on the last Sunday in September during the years 1980-1995, and has ended on the last Sunday in October since 1996, following a unification of start/end dates of summer time within the EU as well as in several European countries then outside the EU.\n\nThe transit authority Västtrafik changes its clocks at 04:00, so that the last tram that leaves around 3:30 actually goes 2:30 on the last weekend of October for those who have changed their clocks at the legal time. The public transport company SL changes their clocks at the legal time, and runs extra departures during the October transition hour.\n\nThe last country in Europe to adopt summer time, in 1981, was Switzerland, even though summer time had been rejected by 52.1% of voters in a federal referendum in 1978.\nSince 1996 Swiss summer time follows EU regulations. It had been in use in 1941 and 1942. Liechtenstein observes the same time as Switzerland. The German village of Büsingen am Hochrhein, a small exclave, entirely surrounded by Swiss territory, also observes the same time as in Switzerland; it did not implement summer time in 1980, and observed the same time as Switzerland, so that there was a one hour time difference between this village and the rest of Germany.\nSummer time was introduced in Turkey in 1947, but suspended from 1965 to 1972. Since 1974, Turkey follows European Summer Time.\n\nIn 2008, the Turkish Ministry of Energy proposed that Turkey should abolish summer time while at the same time switching to GMT +2.5, originally from 2009 onwards, but when this appeared infeasible, to start in 2011, the plan has not been heard of since.\n\nFor the year 2011, Turkey switched to European Summer Time at 3:00 am (03:00) on Monday 28 March, one day later than the rest of Europe, to avoid disrupting the national university entrance examinations held on 27 March.\n\nOnce again, for the year 2014, Turkey switched to European Summer Time at 3:00 am (03:00) on Monday 31 March, one day later than the rest of Europe, to avoid disrupting the local elections held on 30 March.\n\nIn 2015, Turkey delayed the switch from European Summer Time by 2 weeks, to 4:00 am (04:00) on Sunday 8 November, two weeks later than the rest of Europe, due to the calling of a snap general election on Sunday, 1 November.\n\nIn 2016, Turkey scrapped winter time, by switching to New Turkey Time. This means permanent UTC+3, which was used during summer time in Turkey. The switch was on 12:00 am (00:00) on Thursday 8 September, in reality stopping switches between summer and winter time.\nSummer time was introduced in Ukraine in the early 1980s; from 1981 till 1989 this was Moscow Summer Time; since 1992 Eastern European Summer Time has been used.\n\nOn 20 September 2011 the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) voted not to return from Eastern European Summer Time to Eastern European Time. This change would have had the effect of moving Ukraine into the Further-eastern European Time zone along with Belarus and western Russia (which do not observe summer time). However, on 18 October 2011 the Parliament canceled these plans and the country returned to Eastern European Time as scheduled. 295 MPs voted in favour out of 349 registered MPs.\n\nCrimea and regions of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatist militants observe Further-eastern European Time.\n\nIn the United Kingdom local time during this period is known as British Summer Time (BST) () while local time during the rest of the year is normally referred to as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). More generally British Summer Time is part of Western European Summer Time.\n\nLegislation: Summer Time Act 1916; Summer Time Act 1922; Time (Ireland) Act, 1916; Summer Time Act, 1925; Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939; The Summer Time Order 1964; The Summer Time Order 1967; Summer Time Act 1972; The Summer Time Order 1997; The Summer Time Order 2002.\n\nSince 1996 all clocks in the European Union, of which the UK is a member state, have changed on same dates and at the same time, 01:00 GMT.\n\nThe Channel Islands and Isle of Man observe the same time as the UK mainland.\n"}
{"id": "10537149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10537149", "title": "Time in India", "text": "Time in India\n\nThe Republic of India uses one time zone, which is Indian Standard Time (IST). This is — that is, five and a half hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. India does not observe daylight saving time (DST or summer time).\n\nThe official time signal is given by the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory. The IANA time zone database contains only one zone, namely Kolkata. The date and time notation in India shows some specialties.\n\nSome older time zones were:\n\nDuring the Sino–Indian War of 1962 and the Indo–Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971, daylight saving was briefly used to reduce civilian energy consumption.\n\nOne of the earliest known descriptions of \"standard time\" in India appeared in the 4th century CE astronomical treatise Surya Siddhanta. Postulating a spherical earth, the book described the thousands years old customs of the prime meridian, or zero longitude, as passing through \"Avanti\", the ancient name for the historic city of Ujjain, and \"Rohitaka\", the ancient name for Rohtak (), a city near the Kurukshetra.\n\nThe day used by ancient Indian astronomers began at sunrise at the prime meridian of Ujjain, and was divided into smaller time units in the following manner:\n\nTaking a day to be 24 hours, the smallest time unit, \"prāṇa\", or one respiratory cycle, equals 4 seconds, a value consistent with the \"normal breathing frequency\" of 15 breaths/min used in modern medical research. The Surya Siddhanta also described a method of converting local time to the standard time of Ujjain. Despite these early advances, standard time was not widely used outside astronomy. For most of India's history, ruling kingdoms kept their own local time, typically using the Hindu calendar in both lunar and solar units. For example, the Jantar Mantar observatory built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh in Jaipur in 1733 contains large sundials, up to 90 ft (27 m) high, which were used to accurately determine the local time.\n\nIn 1802 Madras time was set up by John Goldingham and this was later used widely by the railways in India. Local time zones were also set up in the important cities of Bombay and Calcutta and as Madras time was intermediate to these, it was one of the early contenders for an Indian standard time zone. Though British India did not officially adopt the standard time zones until 1905, when the meridian passing east of Allahabad at 82.5° E longitude was picked as the central meridian for India, corresponding to a single time zone for the country (). Indian Standard Time came into force on 1 January 1906, and also applied to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). However, Calcutta time was officially maintained as a separate time zone until 1948 and Bombay time until 1955.\n\nIn 1925, time synchronisation began to be relayed through omnibus telephone systems and control circuits to organisations that needed to know the precise time. This continued until the 1940s, when time signals began to be broadcast using the radio by the government. Briefly during World War II, clocks under Indian Standard Time were advanced by one hour, referred to as War Time. This provision lasted from September 1, 1942 to October 15, 1945.\n\nAfter independence in 1947, the Indian government established IST as the official time for the whole country, although Mumbai and Kolkata retained their own local time for a few more years. In 2014 Assamese politicians proposed following a daylight-saving schedule that would be ahead of IST by an hour, but as of January 2014 this had not been approved by the central government.\n"}

As of October 2014, Tricolor TV provided satellite services to over fifteen million subscribers (approximately 40 000 000 viewers).\n\nAccording to the research of J'son and Partners Consulting, Tricolor TV leads HDTV broadcasting in Russia (39,6%). Tricolor TV is the Russian pioneer of UHDTV broadcasting also.\n\nBroadcasting under the trademarks of Tricolor TV and Tricolor TV Siberia is carried out by the National Satellite Company, CJSC (NSC, ).\n\nNational Satellite Company, CJSC was founded at 2005 and registered the trademark. It began test broadcast via Eutelsat W4 on the night of 1 October 2005. First of all, company solved the problem of broadcasting Russian TV channels, therefore new provider was named Tricolor TV (in association with Russian three-color flag). On 12 November Tricolor TV started full-time broadcasting. Subscribers gained access to five channels: Russia (it was rebranded as Russia-1 later), REN TV, Kultura (Russian \"culture\", rebranded as Russia-K), DTV (this channel was rebranded as Peretz, Russian \"pepper\") and TV-3 (broadcasts TV series in mystery, science fiction and fantasy genres). Broadcasting was free of charge and it made the provider popular and growing.\n\nFor half a year, at May 2006 Tricolor TV was subscribed by 150 000 Russian householders. Free-of-charge package was increased to 14 channels, including Tricolor TV’s infochannel.\n\nAt February 2007, the number of subscribers was 500 thousand households. 1 April 2007 Tricolor TV started broadcasting Channel One Russia and its sister channels: Telenyanya (now children's channel Carousel) and Dom Kino (Russian \"the house of cinema\").\n\nAt May 2007 Tricolor TV introduced commercial pack of channels. To this end, the satellite Eutelsat W4 was rented another transponder. The package includes 10 channels (later package Optimum). 10 December 2007 the company began broadcasting in Siberia from satellite Bonum-1. 1 March 2008 Tricolor TV began commercial broadcasting. Technology partners of Tricolor TV Siberia became Russian Satellite Communications Company and Harmonic Inc.\n\nAt 2008, the number of Tricolor TV’s subscribers exceeded 3 million. The company has become a self-sustaining. 17 January 2008 Tricolor TV signed a contract with STS channel and Domashny channel (Russian \"home channel\"). At July 2009, the number of subscribers Tricolor TV reached 5 million households and January 2010 — 6 million.\n\nAt 2010, Tricolor TV started broadcasting new packages of channels: Super Optimum (a lot of channeles in MPEG-4 format), Night Package (a package of erotic TV channels) and channel of Russian Football Premier League.\nFrom February 2010 to 24 March 2012 Tricolor TV provided services of satellite internet access.\n\nBy the end of 2011, Tricolor TV has become one of the leading companies at the Russian TV market with a subscriber base of 9 million subscribers and revenue 4.8 billion rubles. By the end of March 2012 the number of subscribers Tricolor TV reached 10 million households, the total audience of the operator closer to 30 million people.\n\n15 September 2009, it became known that Gazprom Media group signed with NSC memorandum, according to which part of the service and channel NTV Plus is available to subscribers of Tricolor TV. Interested in this transaction, the Federal Antimonopoly Service, as after the proposed transaction Gazprom Media would control 97% of satellite TV in Russia. Deal has not progressed.\n\n7 February 2012 Tricolor TV announced a radical change of strategy. At the Russian TV exhibition CSTB 2012 new Tricolor TV’s CEO Alexander Makarov said that, at first, Tricolor TV is going to broadcast package of foreign channels and, secondly, to form HDTV package. 1 April 2012 Tricolor TV includes to the package Super Optimum foreign channels: France 24, Deutsche Welle, National Geographic Channel, Nat Geo Wild etc. Tricolor TV started test broadcasting of 10 HD channels. For several months, HDTV channels were free of charge.\n\nSales of the service Tricolor TV Full HD began on 24 July. 4 September the company reported about 100 000 subscribers of the service. Promotion of the new product is accompanied with a federal advertising campaign more than 1 billion roubles. 12 January 2013 the number of subscribers of Tricolor TV Full HD reached 1 million households. The package was level up to 25 HD channels.\n\nAt 2013 and 2014, the provider continued to form premium packages. 1 June 2013 Tricolor TV launched Detsky package (Russian \"package for children\"). 1 August Tricolor TV began broadcasting HD version of Russian Football Premier League channel. 1 November Music package was launched.\n\n1 October 2013 Tricolor TV introduced own production five-channel cinema package SuperKino HD (Russian \"super cinema\").

The press release reported that \"VTB Capital, as a global investment bank and a financial investor, will boost the capitalization of assets Tricolor TV and will help to prepare the company for IPO in a few years\".\n\n27 June 2013 Tricolor TV became the first Russian provider, organized a public broadcasting in UHDTV 4K. For direct satellite broadcasting UHDTV content Tricolor TV used 34 transponder of satellite Eutelsat 36A. For public broadcast Tricolor TV’s partner — TV channel Russian Travel Guide (RTG) — filmed a special 19-minute 4K video about extreme sports in Russia. Signal was received with TV set LG 84LM960V. Partners of test broadcasting became Eutelsat Communications, Ericsson, Rohde & Schwarz DVS etc.\n\n22 October 2014 Tricolor TV launched first Russian UHDTV 4K pilot channel.\n\nOn 26 January 2015 instead of the packages “Optimum”, “Super Optimum”, “Maximum HD”, “Maximum HD Siberia” and “Super Maximum HD” the main service “Edinyi” will become available for all subscribers of Tricolor TV. The “Edinyi” tariff will allow to view 28 HD- and over 153 SD-channels depending on the broadcasting format supported by the subscriber’s equipment. This step is continuation of implementation of the operator’s strategy on transfer to the new standard of modern \n\nOn 2 March 2015 the operator’s subscribers gain access to the premium HD-film channels of Tricolor TV’s own production – “KinoPremium HD”, “Semeynoye HD”, “Ostrosujetnoye HD”, “Nashe HD” – within the “Edinyi” package. And the price for the main service remains the same – 1200 Roubles per year.\n\nAs of 8 October 2014 Tricolor TV is the leader of the Russian Pay TV market with a share of 29% of subscribers. In the satellite segment of the Russian market share of the provider is greater than 75%. Tricolor TV is one of the three world's largest satellite providers, giving the number of subscribers only eldest American DTH-operator DirecTV.\n\nBeginning in 2011, Tricolor TV regularly releases about number of subscribers, revenues and average revenue per user (ARPU).\n"}

Used primarily to distinguish states along benchmarks concerning human development—such as macro-economic growth, health, education, and standards of living—an \"underdeveloped\" state is framed as the antithesis of a \"developed\", modern, or industrialized state. Popularized, dominant images of underdeveloped states include those that have less stable economies, less democratic political regimes, greater poverty, malnutrition, and poorer public health and education systems. \n\nUnderdevelopment per Walter Rodney is primarily made of two components, a comparative aspect as well the relationship of exploitation: namely, the exploitation of one country by another. \n\nIn critical development and postcolonial studies, the concepts of \"development\", \"developed\", and \"underdevelopment\" are often thought of to have origins in two periods: first, the colonial era, where colonial powers extracted labor and natural resources, and second (most often) in referring development as the postwar project of intervention on the so-called Third World. Mexican activist Gustavo Esteva asserted that underdevelopment began when American president Harry Truman delivered his inaugural address in 1949 since, after the second world war, poverty on a mass scale was suddenly \"discovered\" in these underdeveloped regions of the world. Esteva stated: \"On that day two billion people became underdeveloped.\" More than half of the world's nations were categorized by what they lacked. The Euro-centric development discourse and its aura of expertise often conflated development with economic growth. When the world began to categorize nations based on their economic status, it narrowed the issue of underdevelopment to an economics problem. As a result, the solutions brought forth by development experts and practitioners were squarely economic—failing to address the profound political and social contexts such as colonial legacies and Cold War geopolitics.\n\nThe Green Revolution is a paradigm of a concerted effort of intervention in the name of global development. During this time, developed countries, in an attempt to modernize the global agricultural sector, sought to export the industrial agricultural model of production. At the start of the Green Revolution, the U.S., Canada, and other advanced European countries were giving their surplus crops to poorer countries in the form of food aid in order to mitigate widespread hunger that parts of the postcolonial world was then witnessing. Crops that weren’t previously prevalent across the globe, such as wheat, were being transferred and from the global north to south in massive quantities. This occurred until developing countries, such as India, became heavily dependent on the food aid—much of which were crops that could not be grown locally. In order for dependent countries to keep receiving foreign assistance, the U.S. made it conditional for recipients of food-aid to adopt the whole industrial model of agriculture.\n\nThe revolution was titled “Green” not just because of its connections to agriculture but also was used as a tool to fight the “Red”, or communist revolution. The West believed that hunger had the power to drive people to peasant revolutions, so food aid was used explicitly to fight the spread communism. While efforts were made to increase food security in poor nations by helping them move to being self-sufficient, the industrial model of agriculture that was exported to recipient countries had a complex system of necessary inputs. In order for yields to actually increase, farmers needed fertilizers, pesticides, and new irrigation systems, a costly chain of requirements that cut profits for the farmers even when their yields rose. The countries that were dependent on food aid now became dependent on the transnational corporations that provided agricultural inputs that the industrial model required. The Green Revolution was able to increase crop yields (at least in the short term, before land was degraded by the increased need for fertilizers and pesticides), but in the process it exacerbated vulnerable populations' poverty in countries that are now considered underdeveloped.\n\nTwo theories in particular have shaped assumptions of development, in terms of their translation into large-scale influence in scholarship, public opinion, and political policies: modernization and dependency theories.\n\nOne of the first major theories to surface as a solution to this new issue of “underdevelopment” was the modernization theory. This highlights the positive role played by Western countries in modernizing and facilitating development in the non-West. It is often contrasted with dependency theory.\n\nThe theory of modernization consists of three parts:\nIn the mid-20th century, the world leaders that had emerged from the Second World War saw the former colonies as areas that needed increasing amounts of intervention because their populations were the subjects of much suffering. It became a moral imperative for developed nations, primarily the U.S., to offer assistance so that these countries could industrialize the way the countries of the first world had. The modernization theory, growing out of U.S. scholarship, equated modernization with industrialization, development, and progress.\n\nOne of the most notable contributors to the theory was Walt Whitman Rostow who developed an economic model which outlined five stages of growth for nations to follow in his essay, “The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto”.\n\nRostow’s Five Stages:\n\nThese stages present a linear trajectory of development in a which the traditional society, exhibiting feudal and “backward” characteristics, can transform into a modern society with advanced industries and urban societies. By placing national growth on a linear path to modernization and hails industrialization as the key to development, Rostow's model simplifies complex inequality between nations by claiming that (since various nations began the process of development at different time periods) different societies are simply at different stages of growth. Rostow’s model makes the assumption that the inequality between states will eventually disappear once each progresses on the timeline of modernity—sped up, he argued, through contact with modernized cultures and their modern economic and political models.\n\nDependency theory reflects the body of mid-20th century theories by various intellectuals, both from the Third World and the First World, that suggest that the wealthy nations of the world need a subjugated peripheral group of poorer states in order to remain wealthy. Dependency theory states that the poverty of the countries in the periphery is not because they are \"not\" integrated into the world system, but because of \"how\" they are integrated into the system.\n\nThese poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labor, and consumer markets for the wealthy nations, without which, according to dependency theorists, they could not have the standard of living they enjoy. First world nations actively, but not necessarily consciously, perpetuate a state of dependency through various policies and initiatives. This state of dependency is multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, sport and all aspects of human resource development. Any attempt by the dependent nations to resist the influences of dependency could result in economic sanctions and/or military invasion and control. This is rare, however, and dependency is enforced far more by the wealthy nations setting the rules of international trade and commerce.\n\nDependency theory first emerged in the 1950s, advocated by Raul Prebisch whose research found that the wealth of poor nations tended to decrease when the wealth of rich nations increased. The theory quickly divided into diverse schools. Some, most notably Andre Gunder Frank and Walter Rodney adapted it to Marxism. \"Standard\" dependency theory differs sharply from Marxism, however, arguing against internationalism and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile. The American sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein refined the Marxist aspect of the theory, and called it the \"world system.\" World system theory adds another layer to what dependency theorists describe as the structure of the world: the semi-periphery. The semi-periphery is composed of countries such as Brazil and South Africa that can't simply be categorized as part of the core or the periphery (i.e. they have developed urban areas but also large areas of rural poverty). World systems theory also states that the dynamic of surplus extraction that occurs between nations also occurs within them, between their elite and poor classes. According to this structure, which includes a core, a periphery, and a semi-periphery, not every nation can develop simultaneously (which directly challenges the linear model of modernization which suggests that all countries are on the trajectory of development). WST instead argues that development and underdevelopment are created simultaneously.\n\nAccording to Brazilian social scientist, Theotonio Dos Santos, dependence means a situation in which certain countries economies' are conditioned by the development and expansion of another to which the former is subject. He goes on to further clarify that the interdependence of two or more economies, and consequently world trade, assumes the form of dependence when dominant countries can create dependency only as a reflection of that expansion, which can have a negative effect on the subordinate’s immediate economy.\n\nGuyanese Marxist historian and political activist and one of the leading theorists on underdevelopment Walter Rodney contends in reference to Africa's underdevelopment, \"The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one's will by any means available. In relations between peoples, the question of power determines maneuverability in bargaining, the extent to which a people survive as a physical and cultural entity. When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society, that in itself is a form of underdevelopment\".\n\nRodney also elaborates on his broader theory of underdevelopment and the issues of using the term especially in reference to comparing economies, saying \"Actually, if 'underdevelopment' were related to anything other than comparing economies, then the most underdeveloped country in the world would be the U.S.A, which practices external oppression on a massive scale, while internally there is a blend of exploitation, brutality, and psychiatric disorder.\" \n\n"}
