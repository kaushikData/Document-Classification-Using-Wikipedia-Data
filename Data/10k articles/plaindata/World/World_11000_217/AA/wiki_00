{"id": "704498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=704498", "title": "Bank run", "text": "Bank run\n\nA bank run (also known as a run on the bank) occurs when a large number of people withdraw their money from a bank, because they believe the bank may cease to function in the near future. In other words, it is when, in a fractional-reserve banking system (where banks normally only keep a small proportion of their assets as cash), a large number of customers withdraw cash from deposit accounts with a financial institution at the same time because they believe that the financial institution is, or might become, insolvent; and keep the cash or transfer it into other assets, such as government bonds, precious metals or gemstones. When they transfer funds to another institution it may be characterised as a capital flight. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own momentum: as more people withdraw cash, the likelihood of default increases, triggering further withdrawals. This can destabilize the bank to the point where it runs out of cash and thus faces sudden bankruptcy. To combat a bank run, a bank may limit how much cash each customer may withdraw, suspend withdrawals altogether, or promptly acquire more cash from other banks or from the central bank, besides other measures.\n\nA banking panic or bank panic is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as people suddenly try to convert their threatened deposits into cash or try to get out of their domestic banking system altogether. A systemic banking crisis is one where all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out. The resulting chain of bankruptcies can cause a long economic recession as domestic businesses and consumers are starved of capital as the domestic banking system shuts down. According to former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, the Great Depression was caused by the Federal Reserve System, and much of the economic damage was caused directly by bank runs. The cost of cleaning up a systemic banking crisis can be huge, with fiscal costs averaging 13% of GDP and economic output losses averaging 20% of GDP for important crises from 1970 to 2007.\n\nSeveral techniques have been used to try to prevent bank runs or mitigate their effects. They have included a higher reserve requirement (requiring banks to keep more of their reserves as cash), government bailouts of banks, supervision and regulation of commercial banks, the organization of central banks that act as a lender of last resort, the protection of deposit insurance systems such as the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and after a run has started, a temporary suspension of withdrawals. These techniques do not always work: for example, even with deposit insurance, depositors may still be motivated by beliefs they may lack immediate access to deposits during a bank reorganization.\n\nBank runs first appeared as part of cycles of credit expansion and its subsequent contraction. In the 16th century onwards, English goldsmiths issuing promissory notes suffered severe failures due to bad harvests, plummeting parts of the country into famine and unrest. Other examples are the Dutch Tulip manias (1634–1637), the British South Sea Bubble (1717–1719), the French Mississippi Company (1717–1720), the post-Napoleonic depression (1815–1830) and the Great Depression (1929–1939).\n\nBank runs have also been used to blackmail individuals or governments. In 1832, for example, the British government under the Duke of Wellington overturned a majority government on the orders of the king, William IV, to prevent reform (the later 1832 Reform Act). Wellington's actions angered reformers, and they threatened a run on the banks under the rallying cry \"Stop the Duke, go for gold!\".\n\nMany of the recessions in the United States were caused by banking panics. The Great Depression contained several banking crises consisting of runs on multiple banks from 1929 to 1933; some of these were specific to regions of the U.S. Bank runs were most common in states whose laws allowed banks to operate only a single branch, dramatically increasing risk compared to banks with multiple branches particularly when single-branch banks were located in areas economically dependent on a single industry.\n\nBanking panics began in the Upper-South in November 1930, one year after the stock market crash, triggered by the collapse of a string of banks in Tennessee and Kentucky, which brought down their correspondent networks. In December, New York City experienced massive bank runs that were contained to the many branches of a single bank. Philadelphia was hit a week later by bank runs that affected several banks, but were successfully contained by quick action by the leading city banks and the Federal Reserve Bank. Withdrawals became worse after financial conglomerates in New York and Los Angeles failed in prominently-covered scandals. Much of the US Depression's economic damage was caused directly by bank runs, though Canada had no bank runs during this same era due to different banking regulations.\nMilton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that steady withdrawals from banks by nervous depositors (\"hoarding\") were inspired by news of the fall 1930 bank runs and forced banks to liquidate loans, which directly caused a decrease in the money supply, shrinking the economy. Bank runs continued to plague the United States for the next several years. Citywide runs hit Boston (Dec. 1931), Chicago (June 1931 and June 1932), Toledo (June 1931), and St. Louis (Jan. 1933), among others. Institutions put into place during the Depression have prevented runs on U.S. commercial banks since the 1930s, even under conditions such as the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe global financial crisis that began in 2007 was centered around market-liquidity failures that were comparable to a bank run. The crisis contained a wave of bank nationalizations, including those associated with Northern Rock of the UK and IndyMac of the U.S. This crisis was caused by low real interest rates stimulating an asset price bubble fuelled by new financial products that were not stress tested and that failed in the downturn.\n\nUnder fractional-reserve banking, the type of banking currently used in most developed countries, banks retain only a fraction of their demand deposits as cash. The remainder is invested in securities and loans, whose terms are typically longer than the demand deposits, resulting in an asset–liability mismatch. No bank has enough reserves on hand to cope with all deposits being taken out at once.\n\nDiamond and Dybvig developed an influential model to explain why bank runs occur and why banks issue deposits that are more liquid than their assets. According to the model, the bank acts as an intermediary between borrowers who prefer long-maturity loans and depositors who prefer liquid accounts. The Diamond-Dybvig model provides an example of an economic game with more than one Nash equilibrium, where it is logical for individual depositors to engage in a bank run once they suspect one might start, even though that run will cause the bank to collapse.\n\nIn the model, business investment requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns that take time in coming, for example, spending on machines and buildings now for production in future years. A business or entrepreneur that needs to borrow to finance investment will want to give their investments a long time to generate returns before full repayment, and will prefer long maturity loans, which offer little liquidity to the lender. The same principle applies to individuals and households seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as housing or automobiles. The households and firms who have the money to lend to these businesses may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, so they are often willing to lend only on the condition of being guaranteed immediate access to their money in the form of liquid demand deposit accounts, that is, accounts with shortest possible maturity. Since borrowers need money and depositors fear to make these loans individually, banks provide a valuable service by aggregating funds from many individual deposits, portioning them into loans for borrowers, and spreading the risks both of default and sudden demands for cash. Banks can charge much higher interest on their long-term loans than they pay out on demand deposits, allowing them to earn a profit.\nIf only a few depositors withdraw at any given time, this arrangement works well. Barring some major emergency on a scale matching or exceeding the bank's geographical area of operation, depositors' unpredictable needs for cash are unlikely to occur at the same time; that is, by the law of large numbers, banks can expect only a small percentage of accounts withdrawn on any one day because individual expenditure needs are largely uncorrelated. A bank can make loans over a long horizon, while keeping only relatively small amounts of cash on hand to pay any depositors who may demand withdrawals.\n\nHowever, if many depositors withdraw all at once, the bank itself (as opposed to individual investors) may run short of liquidity, and depositors will rush to withdraw their money, forcing the bank to liquidate many of its assets at a loss, and eventually to fail. If such a bank were to attempt to call in its loans early, businesses might be forced to disrupt their production while individuals might need to sell their homes and/or vehicles, causing further losses to the larger economy. Even so, many if not most debtors would be unable to pay the bank in full on demand and would be forced to declare bankruptcy, possibly affecting other creditors in the process.\n\nA bank run can occur even when started by a false story. Even depositors who know the story is false will have an incentive to withdraw, if they suspect other depositors will believe the story. The story becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Indeed, Robert K. Merton, who coined the term \"self-fulfilling prophecy\", mentioned bank runs as a prime example of the concept in his book \"Social Theory and Social Structure\". Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, once noted that it may not be rational to start a bank run, but it is rational to participate in one once it had started.\n\nA bank run is the sudden withdrawal of deposits of just one bank. A \"banking panic\" or \"bank panic\" is a financial crisis that occurs when many banks suffer runs at the same time, as a cascading failure. In a \"systemic banking crisis\", all or almost all of the banking capital in a country is wiped out; this can result when regulators ignore systemic risks and spillover effects.\n\nSystemic banking crises are associated with substantial fiscal costs and large output losses. Frequently, emergency liquidity support and blanket guarantees have been used to contain these crises, not always successfully. Although fiscal tightening may help contain market pressures if a crisis is triggered by unsustainable fiscal policies, expansionary fiscal policies are typically used. In crises of liquidity and solvency, central banks can provide liquidity to support illiquid banks. Depositor protection can help restore confidence, although it tends to be costly and does not necessarily speed up economic recovery. Intervention is often delayed in the hope that recovery will occur, and this delay increases the stress on the economy.\n\nSome measures are more effective than others in containing economic fallout and restoring the banking system after a systemic crisis. These include establishing the scale of the problem, targeted debt relief programs to distressed borrowers, corporate restructuring programs, recognizing bank losses, and adequately capitalizing banks. Speed of intervention appears to be crucial; intervention is often delayed in the hope that insolvent banks will recover if given liquidity support and relaxation of regulations, and in the end this delay increases stress on the economy. Programs that are targeted, that specify clear quantifiable rules that limit access to preferred assistance, and that contain meaningful standards for capital regulation, appear to be more successful. According to IMF, government-owned asset management companies (bad banks) are largely ineffective due to political constraints.\n\nA \"silent run\" occurs when the implicit fiscal deficit from a government's unbooked loss exposure to zombie banks is large enough to deter depositors of those banks. As more depositors and investors begin to doubt whether a government can support a country's banking system, the silent run on the system can gather steam, causing the zombie banks' funding costs to increase. If a zombie bank sells some assets at market value, its remaining assets contain a larger fraction of unbooked losses; if it rolls over its liabilities at increased interest rates, it squeezes its profits along with the profits of healthier competitors. The longer the silent run goes on, the more benefits are transferred from healthy banks and taxpayers to the zombie banks. The term is also used when a large number of depositors in countries with deposit insurance draw down their balances below the limit for deposit insurance.\n\nThe cost of cleaning up after a crisis can be huge. In systemically important banking crises in the world from 1970 to 2007, the average net recapitalization cost to the government was 6% of GDP, fiscal costs associated with crisis management averaged 13% of GDP (16% of GDP if expense recoveries are ignored), and economic output losses averaged about 20% of GDP during the first four years of the crisis.\n\nSeveral techniques have been used to help prevent or mitigate bank runs.\n\nSome prevention techniques apply to individual banks, independently of the rest of the economy.\n\nSome prevention techniques apply across the whole economy, though they may still allow individual institutions to fail.\n\nThe role of the lender of last resort, and the existence of deposit insurance, both create moral hazard, since they reduce banks' incentive to avoid making risky loans. They are nonetheless standard practice, as the benefits of collective prevention are commonly believed to outweigh the costs of excessive risk-taking.\n\nTechniques to deal with a banking panic when prevention have failed:\n\nThe bank panic of 1933 is the setting of Archibald MacLeish's 1935 play, \"Panic\". Other fictional depictions of bank runs include those in \"American Madness\" (1932), \"It's a Wonderful Life\" (1946), \"Mary Poppins\" (1964), \"Noble House\" (1988) and \"The Pope Must Die\" (1991)\n\nArthur Hailey's novel \"The Moneychangers\" includes a potentially fatal run on a fictitious US bank.\n\nA run on a bank is one of the many causes of the characters' suffering in Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\".\n"}

A choke point can allow a numerically inferior defending force to thwart a larger opponent if the attacker cannot bring superior numbers to bear.\n\nSome historical examples of the tactical use of choke points are King Leonidas I's defense of the Pass of Thermopylae during an invasion led by Xerxes I of Persia; the Battle Of Stamford Bridge in which Harold Godwinson defeated Harald Hardrada; William Wallace's victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge (Wallace had around 2,300 men against the English army of about 9,000 to 12,000 men and the bridge collapsed during the battle); and the Battle of Agincourt in which Henry V of England decisively defeated the French when they were forced to attack his smaller army through a narrow gap in the Agincourt Woods.\n\nIt was the suitability of the Caribbean as a chokepoint that attracted pirates and buccaneers during the 17th century. The Spanish treasure fleets leaving the Americas would need to pass there to pick up the strong, prevailing, westerly winds that would take them back to Spain.\n\nThe most important naval choke points were first identified by Fisher in his defence of continued British colonialism (important colonies in parentheses):\n\n\nThe Fulda Gap was seen as one of the potentially decisive bottleneck battlegrounds of the Cold War in Germany.\n\nFrom the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the sheer size of the United Kingdom's Royal Navy meant it had control over much of the world's oceans and seas. Choke points were of huge importance to the British Empire, which often used them to control trade in British colonies and, to a lesser extent, for defense. Choke points have also been a source of tension, notably during the Suez Crisis. The Royal Navy still deems its choke points as strategically vital. Indeed, the importance of choke points was first recognised by British Admiral John Fisher.\n\nThese are major British choke points today:\n\nThe choke points still have significant strategic importance for the Royal Navy. The GIUK gap is particularly important to the Royal Navy, as any attempt by northern European forces to break into the open Atlantic would have to do so through the heavily defended English Channel, which is also the world's busiest shipping lane, or through one of the exits on either side of Iceland. Considering British control over the strategic fortress of Gibraltar at the entrance to the Mediterranean, Spain (northern coast), France (Atlantic coast) and Portugal are the only mainland European nations that have direct access to the Atlantic Ocean in a way that cannot be easily blocked at a choke point by the Royal Navy. The GIUK gap was also a strategically important part of the Cold War, as the Royal Navy were given the responsibility of keeping an eye on Soviet submarines trying to break into the open Atlantic.\n\nChoke points remain a prominent issue today in the global economy and shipments of goods, particularly oil: 20% of the world's oil is shipped through the Strait of Hormuz, which has seen conflicts such as the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by American missiles in 1988. The Suez Canal and the Sumed pipeline carry a day, and the canal carried a total of 7.5% of world trade in 2011. The canal was closed for eight years after the Six-Day War in 1967. In many instances, alternate routes are nonexistent or impractical. For example, an alternate to the Suez/Sumed route required an additional around Cape of Good Hope. The Royal Navy also still deems its choke points to the Atlantic as strategically important.\n\n"}

In 1995, the provinces of Sichuan and Xinjiang reported their first HIV cases, and by 1998, the virus had spread all over China.\n\nLow awareness of the disease among China's general population appears to be a major culprit. Most Chinese consider HIV/AIDS as a foreign issue, and even educated people are less knowledgeable of the virus, its transmission and prevention, than people in other countries. Until recently, the use of condoms was not very common, even among sex workers and their clients. As a result, the epidemic has spread from high-risk groups (drug users, sex workers, unsafe blood donors) to the general population.\n\nHeroin flows into Yunnan Province from neighboring Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, bringing with it HIV. The province's first cases were reported in 1989. With a population of 44 million, Yunnan now has only 200 health workers trained for the disease. Officials estimate that the province has 80,000 infected people, most of them intravenous drug users who have spread the disease by sharing needles. In Gejiu, a city of 310,000 people on a route favored by drug traffickers, initial rounds of AIDS testing in recent years found more than 1,000 people with HIV, nearly all drug users or prostitutes. Unlike some other provinces, Yunnan has welcomed international nonprofit groups and support from Britain, Australia, and more recently the United States.\n\n\"3 Needles\" is a 2005 dramatic film depicting the lives of people in Yunnan during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One of the film's protagonists, a pregnant black-market operative played by Lucy Liu, makes her living as a blood smuggler. But when several blood donors begin to get sick and die, she realizes that she may have jeopardized the health of the village's safety and beyond. \"3 Needles\" is an attempt to visualize the profound experience of Gao Yaojie and many others as we can read in The New York Times sequel.\n\nSince 2001, the State Council of the People's Republic of China has officially advocated needle social marketing as an HIV prevention measure. Evidence from research and study tours to countries such as Australia, which runs successful needle exchange programmes, prompted the Ministry of Health (China) to support the first such programme in Yunnan province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1999. On the basis of the successes of the pilot, the programme was expanded in 2004, and plans are in place to open an additional 1500 methadone maintenance treatment clinics for about 300 000 heroin users by 2008. A National Training Centre for methadone maintenance treatment has been established in Yunnan to provide clinical and technical support.\n\nCommercial sex work is illegal in the People's Republic of China; hence, brothels are illegal and commercial sex workers operate out of places of entertainment (e.g., karaoke bars), hotels, hair-dressing salons, or on the street. The traditional strategy for controlling HIV transmission through commercial sex workers has been the development of stricter laws to prevent risky behaviours, accompanied by raids on suspected sex establishments by public security officials. In 1996–97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighbouring Thailand, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviours to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan.\n\nIn 2002, a United Nations-commissioned report, entitled \"China's Titanic peril\", estimating that the People's Republic of China had about 1 million cases of HIV, and that it was on the brink of an \"explosive HIV/AIDS epidemic…with an imminent risk to widespread dissemination to the general population\". The report continued: \"a potential HIV/AIDS disaster of unimaginable proportion now lies in wait.\" A few months later, the US National Intelligence Council estimated that 1-2 million people were living with HIV in People's Republic of China, and predicted 10–15 million cases by 2010. Other reports at this time were similarly pessimistic: from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (Washington, DC, USA), HIV/AIDS was referred to as China's time-bomb; and from the American Enterprise Institute as the AIDS typhoon. However, as Wu and colleagues note, by 2006 the number of people living with HIV/AIDS is estimated to be 650 000—a figure revised downwards by 200 000 from 2005. After a slow start and reluctance to recognise the existence of risk activities in its population and of the HIV epidemic, China has responded to international influences, media coverage, and scientific evidence to take bold steps to control the epidemic, using scientifically validated strategies. A Joint Assessment of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Treatment and Care in China (2004), developed jointly by UNAIDS and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, estimated that the country had 840,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. This figure was revised down to 650,000 in 2005 in light of more representative data collection and more appropriate estimation methods.\n\nYunnan province has shown strong support for implementation and advocacy of harm-reduction strategies that reduce HIV transmission in its many drug users, whereas Henan province had been slower to respond to the needs of former plasma donors in the early stages of the epidemic. The distribution of HIV in China is not even, and is concentrated in areas with high drug use (i.e. Yunnan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Sichuan) and in areas where people were infected through unsafe blood or plasma donation (i.e. Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi, and Hubei). The number of cases ranges dramatically between provinces (see the map of China on your right), with, for example, just 20 cases reported from Tibet but well over 40,000 in neighbouring Yunnan.\n\nYunnan Red Cross was one of the first non-government organizations fighting HIV/AIDS in China. It was established in 1994, as an adaptation of the Australian Red Cross, and is operating five projects in various locations throughout the province.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38519530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38519530", "title": "International Anti-Poaching Foundation", "text": "International Anti-Poaching Foundation\n\nThe International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF) is a non-profit organisation registered in Australia, predominately operating on the African continent. The group has a structured military-like approach to conservation, employing tactics and technology generally reserved for the modern-day battlefield.\n\nFollowing service in Iraq spanning 12 years of duty, former Australian naval clearance diver and special operations sniper Damien Mander headed for Africa with the intention of using his niche skills for conservation. What was initially to be a short adventure quickly turned into an obsession as Mander observed first-hand the harsh realities that front-line rangers and wildlife face on a daily basis. Liquidating his life savings and real estate portfolio accumulated from nine years of military service, Mander founded the IAPF in 2009. He was soon joined by his working colleague, wartime veteran and friend of 11 years, Steven Dean. The pair now operate the IAPF in Africa, spending most of the year on the ground protecting wildlife.\n\nAcross much of Africa anti-poaching tactics have remained largely unchanged for decades. Small groups of undertrained and poorly equipped rangers are sent out for days on end to conduct patrols in remote and dangerous locations. Modern-day poachers have evolved and routinely utilise military tactics and equipment to kill individual members of high-target species, such as elephants, rhinos and gorillas. Seeing this shortfall, the IAPF set out to fill the gap.\n\nWhat initially started out as a training organisation quickly expanded into a community outreach, management, and research-orientated outfit, capable of running autonomously or alongside existing projects.\n\nThe organisation has a strong emphasis on public relations, and the media has responded well to the story of two transformed soldiers now dedicated to conservation and to encouraging a modern generation to stand up and have more empathy for animals and the environment. Mander is an outspoken animal activist who is not afraid to publicly voice his views on critical environmental issues, from poaching to increased human pressures on wilderness areas. In 2013, three separate nominations at The Humane Society of the United States' 28th annual Genesis Awards featured stories on the IAPF. These awards honour animal welfare issues in the media.\n\nIn 2010, the TV program 60 Minutes travelled to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe to film IAPF operations. This showcased to a large audience the plight of the black rhinoceros, listed as critically endangered and under increasing threat as the price of their horns continues to rise steeply in Asia. In 2012, 60 Minutes filmed the IAPF using unmanned drones (UAVs) in Mozambique's Niassa National Reserve.\n\n\"National Geographic Magazine\" shadowed the IAPF whilst writing its feature article \"Rhino Wars.\" The article (which earned a first prize world press photo award for Brent Stirton) covered organised crime's role in poaching, the pros and cons if the rhino horn trade were legalised, and the militarised ranger training and operations that the IAPF delivers.\n\nThe IAPF is governed by a board of directors in Australia, a board of trustees in Zimbabwe, and an international advisory board. It is independently audited annually. Registered as a non-profit(ABN 57142987782), the majority of its funding comes from the Australian general public.\n\nThe IAPF has attracted the attention and support of Monaco's Conservation Guardians, an organisation on whose board Mander sits as a Director.\n\nIn May 2013, Damien Mander made a presentation about the plight of animals in today's society in a TEDx presentation held at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nThe IAPF has established two full-time operational centres. The first, combined with IAPF's headquarters, is based on the Stanley & Livingstone Private Game Reserve 13 km from Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. On this Big Five game (lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, rhinoceros) reserve is a training academy where rangers from Zimbabwe receive basic and intermediate training. The team also operates an anti-poaching unit, protecting the breeding program of black rhinos on the reserve. Whilst no rhinos have been killed under the IAPF's watch, the nearest population at Sinamatella in Hwange National Park (100 km east) has tragically declined at the hands of poachers—from 74 down to just four rhinos in the space of a mere six years. Despite the reserve sitting in a prime position for poaching (close to 4 international borders and surrounded by a population of 85,000 people – 60,000 of whom are unemployed) it experiences very few breaches these days. The last poachers captured in the reserve were apprehended carrying automatic weapons and received a collective 60-year jail sentence.\n\nThe IAPF operation comes under close and constant scrutiny from the Zimbabwean authorities, who focus on the hardline tactics associated with their training and operations. Mander maintains that whilst there is a shoot-on-sight policy for armed poachers in Zimbabwe, the IAPF's training focuses strongly on the correct escalation in the use of force. This ensures using the minimum amount of force required to get the job done.\n\nIn South Africa the IAPF initiated the development of the Anti-Poaching Ranger qualification – the new national standard that aims to unify a fragmented industry.\n\nMany benefits come from standardising the training of anti-poaching rangers, such as the potential for joint operations, allowing rotation, providing a career path, and developing a national certificate for rangers who have long deserved recognition.\n\nThe training materials making up the \"Anti-Poaching Ranger Qualification\" are scheduled for completion in late 2014. The organisations assisting the IAPF in compiling the manuals have co-ownership of the material. The project will make training and training materials more readily available, and at a much higher industry standard. This project fills a void in the conservation industry, and has been backed by individuals including Dr Ian Player, who is largely credited with saving the Southern White Rhinoceros from extinction, and Pelham Jones, Chairman of the Private Rhino Owners Association.\n\nIn the South African Tourism Update Magazine article titled \"A Spotlight on Poaching\", the IAPF's Anti-Poaching Ranger Qualification was listed as one of four noteworthy initiatives initiated to protect our wildlife.\n\nWhen Mander was the Project Manager of the Iraq Special Training Academy in Baghdad and Dean was a senior instructor, they trained up to 700 paramilitary cadets at a time for redeployment. Using this experience, Mander and Dean set out to transform learning opportunities for rangers around the world by developing better education and training standards. The skills they learnt in Iraq were a start point for training in Zimbabwe, and they set about providing it free of charge for rangers. This evolved towards developing national qualifications and a much more professional and structured approach in delivery.\n\nThe IAPF's rangers are taught such skills as ambush, patrolling, arrest, crime scene preservation, and camouflage and concealment. Many of the skills are an adaptation of military courses, adjusted to suit the environment in which they are required, and with a deep underlying conservation tone. During training courses, even convicted poachers have been rehabilitated and sent out to work as rangers.\n\nThe illegal trafficking of wildlife is one of the largest criminal industries in the world alongside drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. As continued and increasing pressure is placed on wilderness areas, the IAPF endeavours to increase the level of defence it provides, evolving to stay ahead of its adversaries.\n\nThe organisation has grown from being a localised problem-solver to becoming a solution-provider. The lack of availability of unmanned drones and of superior training packages are two major shortfalls for most conservationists. These shortfalls have the full attention of the IAPF.\n\nThe IAPF is assisted by volunteers both on the ground and abroad. Termed the \"Green Army,\" this growing group assists with day-to-day responsibilities. When deployed in Africa with the IAPF, volunteers come face to face with the African Big Five whilst also assisting with teaching, patrolling, and monitoring of wildlife.\n\nThe IAPF's key members have accumulated significant amounts of time in modern wartime theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and have been exposed to evolving tactics and technology. Mander and Dean, having seen UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or drones) technology deployed in Iraq, were convinced of its place in conservation. Whilst initial enquiries were made into attaining UAVs as early as 2009, the IAPF UAV program did not commence officially until 2012.\n\nMander has remarked of the UAV program: \"Having real-time intelligence greatly increases operational capabilities when reacting to poachers.\" \"A UAV can cover in a few hours what a ground team will cover in a week.\" \"Conservationists must now be given the capacity to embrace the same technology that is made available to the military.\"\n\nIn mid-2012, international media became aware of the IAPF's use of non-weaponized unmanned drones for conservation. Mander, along with IAPF's Technical Development Director Simon Beart (a former Royal Navy helicopter technician), started to regularly portray to the world the use of UAVs in conservation, and their thoughts on their future use. Mander is quoted as asking, \"Why could I have a UAV watching over me in Iraq, but these elephants here cannot have the same privilege?\"\n\nSeeing articles appear in the media and hearing the call to arms, a number of Australians and South Africans came forward. A late-2012 Sydney UAV conference cemented a team of world-class standards. The IAPF is moving towards the next phase of UAV operations, which consists of purchasing drones that are affordable, durable, and easy to operate from long range.\n\nDespite these plans, the IAPF is aware that many are pinning their hopes on the use of the unmanned drones as a \"silver bullet\" solution. Mander maintains a healthy degree of caution: \"Drones are not the answer, they are a tool in the box. It is how we utilise these tools that will allow us to change the way we do things.\" An entire department within the IAPF has been developed to test and write the manuals for ground operations, utilising UAV technology.\n\nIn addition to UAVs, the IAPF constantly explores new ways to modernise tactics and operations for anti-poaching.\n\nThe IAPF is often linked in the media and through its projects with rhino conservation. Mander has been quoted as saying, \"The rhino is the hardest animal to protect. Poachers are willing to go to more lengths to kill a rhino than any other creature. If we aim to protect the rhino and succeed, we know that everything else in its ecosystem will be looked after.\"\n\nSince 2008, rhino-poaching has increased significantly each year. A total of 633 rhinos were poached in South Africa alone in 2012. Rhinos are being hunted to extinction for their horns. As this animal, and thus its coveted body part, becomes increasingly rare, the market value increases, further aggravating the situation. Rhino horn has now become an ornamental object of status in Vietnam, where it has attained a street value of US$75,000 per kilogram. In other examples of Vietnam's desire for status-driven products, when the market has been saturated by these products, their price has dropped precipitously, resulting in plummeting demand. This strategy could work to reduce rhino poaching, given the current stockpiles of their horns (in South Africa there are 40 tons and in Zimbabwe five tons).\n\nMander and Dean have journeyed to Vietnam in order to understand the illegal wildlife trade from the Asian perspective, so that they could make up their own minds as to whether a legalised trade in rhino horn could be a solution. In an effort to understand the mindset of the consumer, Mander has made this observation: \"I can't help but wonder whether, if my young son or daughter was dying, I myself wouldn't travel to the ends of the earth and beyond to try to save them, or at least give hope. When life is on the line, where do we stop?\"\n\nMander's report on the journey, titled \"Damned if you do and damned if you don't: legalizing the rhino horn trade,\" was widely published. It attracted the attention of such luminaries as world-renowned rhino conservationist Dr. Ian Player: Damien Mander is an extraordinary man who was in the Special Forces in the Australian Army, and served in Iraq. He became interested in the rhino and came out to Zimbabwe where he has been working under the most difficult conditions. I think his report is outstanding, and certainly leaves no doubt in one's mind about the demand for rhino horn and the need for some clear thinking on the whole subject. My own view remains the same which is the position of the Wilderness Foundation and that there should be limited regulated trade in the horns that have been gathered through natural mortality.\n\nWith the release of that article, the IAPF joined the debate between conservation groups calling for a review of the 1976 CITES ban, outlawing a trade in rhino horn. Mander's point of view is that Asians cannot be re-educated away from a 2,500-year-old philosophy of traditional medicine, and one would be arrogant to think so. The situation is worsening, and conservationists working on the ground in Africa need logical solutions. \"At present, the only proposal on the table that make a rhino worth more alive than dead is a legal trade in rhino horn,\" Mander is quoted as saying.\n\nThe situation continues to deteriorate. New solutions are needed. Many fear that the worst is still to come and trends certainly indicate this.\n\nIn 2010, the IAPF began negotiations with the Zimbabwe government to start work in Chizarira National Park, the country's fourth largest (1,910 km2) and most ecologically diverse national park. Approval to complete the feasibility study to resurrect the park was finally granted in 2011, and the study was completed in May 2012. The document outlines the enormous amount of work ahead—the result of over 20 years of neglect due to the financial hardships faced by the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority. Despite the neglect, Chizarira is described as an enchanting place, lost in time and still remaining as one of Southern Africa's most spectacular protected areas. In anticipation of the project, Chizarira Lodge was donated to the IAPF to use as a headquarters, training facility and base for researchers.\n\nThe IAPF's Schools Committee in Australia has made inroads at the grassroots level. The secondary school geography curriculum teaches Australian children about poaching and the Africa savannah, and uses the rhino as a metaphor for Mother Nature and for the struggle we are facing environmentally as a global community.\n\n"}

The ICE project makes use of case research and computer applications in international relations research. The cases can be searched through a pattern matching tool. ICE establishes a perspective in which disaggregated data is combined with geographic information in the study of conflicts.\n\nICE Case studies are sets of categorical research projects meant to spur further research in specific areas of international dispute. The ICE cases are related to the Trade and Environment Database project (TED). Since 1991, the TED and ICE projects have produced over a range of case study projects. ICE has about 300 cases. Among the practical uses of such case studies, ICE provides information on environmental refugees, conflict dimensions, countries involved and related issues. ICE case studies have been of interest in both research and policy arenas. The ICE cases can be found HERE.\n\nConflict and environment are modern and age-old problems and the cases represent this continuum of impact. The history of conflict and environment dates back many thousands of years. AT the root of these cases are control over resources and migrations of peoples. These two drivers will remain at the core of environmental conflict cases, now and in the future.\n\nICE project is an evolving search engine and a tool for looking at international conflicts in the context of events and in contexts of similar and/or different typologies.

{"id": "5518245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5518245", "title": "Los 40", "text": "Los 40\n\nLos 40 (The 40, stylized as LOS40 and formerly \"Los 40 Principales\", ) is a Top 40 musical radio network and radio station brand in many Spanish-speaking countries from Prisa Radio. The station has its origins as a music show at Radio Madrid, today Cadena SER in 1966, where the 40 Principales chart was born, then evolved into a spin-off radio station in 1979. The brand’s network in Spain has 3,000,000 listeners alone.\n\nSome stations under this brand name are owned and operated or are licensed by Grupo PRISA to use the brand. Some LOS40 stations are operated by a local broadcasting company and affiliated with the company that holds a license to use the brand from Grupo PRISA. Each LOS40 network typically broadcasts its own national feed from its respective country.\n\nLOS40 stations broadcast in:\n\nMost LOS40 networks generally air Spanish and English contemporary hit music that mostly includes American, Latin American, Pan-European and British singers and bands. Most stations emphasize Latin Top 40 music; however Mexico, Panama and Dominican stations feature more European and English-language music whilst Chile and Costa Rica stations plays more reggaeton and bachata. It has a high-rotation playlist consisting mainly of tracks from its private chart. The main music genres that can be heard are pop, pop-rock and some dance music from the '90s, '00s and present day.\n\nIn 1965, the Ministry of Information and Tourism passed a law forcing medium wave radio stations to launch FM stations to develop FM in Spain. Due to the high costs of producing new shows, most of the schedule for the new stations was based on music, mainly classical music. In 1966, Cadena SER asked one of its broadcasters, Rafael Revert, to develop a new music show aimed at a younger audience. So he took the idea of the Top 40 and created a chart with the 40 top singles of the week, which would be voted on by the audience. So, on July the 18th, 1966, the first show of Los 40 Principales was broadcast on Radio Madrid, marking the debut of the chart list, with \"Monday Monday\" by the Mamas & the Papas as the first number 1 on the list.\n\nSoon, the show would be broadcast on ten Cadena SER radio stations. At first it was a daily show, revealing candidates during the week, and the new list each Saturday. The viewers would phone each station to vote for their favorite songs. The show was recorded in Madrid, then the tape was sent to all of the affiliate stations throughout Spain and broadcast simultaneously. The duration of the show was increased during the 70s from the original 1 hour to 2, 4 and finally 8 hours by the end of the 1970s. In 1979, Cadena SER decided to create new 40 Principales stations, which would be dedicated to the chart and its candidates 24 hours a day. At first, the 40 Principales stations were still part of Cadena SER, becoming an independent network in 1987, though still owned by Grupo PRISA alongside Cadena SER. In 1985, the 40 Principales main station began broadcasting live by satellite throughout Spain.\n\nIn 1990, the chart show started being broadcast also on TV through Canal+, and in 1998 also on the newly created 40 Principales TV satellite channel. The chart show got its present name, \"Del 40 al 1\" (\"From 40 to 1\"), in 1995. During the 2000s, 40 Principales was expanded through Latin American opening several stations in Spanish speaking countries with either local media companies operating stations within a country or listening area or Grupo Prisa operating a company within a country.\n\nIn May 2016, Los 40 Principales re-branded as simply LOS40. The main reason was that the station \"is so much more than a top 40 list\".\n\nIn September 2017, the LOS40 TV channel was shut down after almost two decades of broadcasting.\n\nIn December 2014, DJ Paul Hip asked listeners of 40 Principales Chile what they would do for free music concert festival tickets. The radio station hosted a competition for contestants to come up with their own challenges. If their challenge was accepted by the radio DJ, they were given the opportunity to complete it to win the tickets.\n\nOne female listener offered to do \"actually anything, up to and including licking whipped cream out of a human anus\" to win tickets to the Mysteryland EDM festival. Hip took the woman up on the proposal - in the middle of his show. On 17 December 2014, she completed the act live on air. Hip then proceeded to invite listeners of the radio station to kiss the woman who had just licked whipped cream from his anus to win tickets of their own.\n\nThe radio station's production team tweeted an uncensored image of the act, which went viral over Twitter and caused controversy, with Twitter followers calling the act \"misogynist and humiliating\" and questioning the station's ethics and journalistic ethic. The radio station later issued an apology saying they were sorry if they had offended their audience and they probably should not have accepted such challenge, but assured it was completely \"voluntary and even suggested by the participant\" in a contest that was open to what ever each contestant wanted to do. The radio station deleted the tweet promptly after the negative reactions and assured their fans the contest's only purpose was to have fun, and not to hurt or demean anyone.\n\n\n"}

Aim of the program is to \"gain access to high-capacity international fiber-optic cables that transit at major congestion points around the world\".\n\nNSA is working with secret cooperation with the partner countries, which are hosting U.S. equipment and providing access to the fiber-optic cables. In 2013 the program had \"access to over 3 terabits per second of data streaming world-wide and encompasses all communication technologies such as voice, fax, telex, modem, email internet chat, virtual private network (VPN), voice over IP (VoIP), and voice call records\" and there were total of 37 partner countries including 17 European Union member states.\n\nThere are two conditions on the partnership between the NSA and the partner country for making an agreement. The first one is that the partner countries will not use the NSA's technology to collect any data on U.S. citizens. The second one is that the NSA will not use the access it has been granted in the partner countries to collect data on the host countries' citizens. Although these conditions have exceptions, NSA doesn't state which those exceptions are. According to Edward Snowden, these agreements between the NSA and its partner countries are vague and are easily circumvented.\n\nThe program was publicly revealed in June 2014, by the Danish newspaper \"Dagbladet Information\" and by \"The Intercept\". Revelation of the program was based on as part of the leaks by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nAccording to a NSA's classified intelligence briefing in 2010, RAMPART-A was used across all NSA Analysis and Production lines, and in the previous year (2009), over 9000 intelligence reports were written based solely on the RAMPART-A data.\n\nThe program cost about $170 million between 2011 and 2013.The program started in 1992.\n\nXKeyscore is implemented in the program's architecture.\n\nThe partner countries are divided into two groups by their cooperation level, \"Second\" and \"Third\".\n\nFor the host partner country, U.S. provides processing and analysis tools and equipment, which means that the partner countries are able to use the NSA's tools for processing and analysing the data that flows in and out of their country. It's likely that not every partner country has RAMPART-A site(s); in 2013 NSA had set up at least 13 RAMPART-A sites, nine of which were in active state. Three of the largest sites, \"AZUREPHOENIX\", \"SPINNERET\" and \"MOONLIGHTPATH\" gathers traffic from some 70 different cables or networks.\n\nSecond level (partners of the Five Eyes) partner countries:\n\nThird level partner countries:\n\n"}
