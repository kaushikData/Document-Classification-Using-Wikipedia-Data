{"id": "33409644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33409644", "title": "African Wildlife Foundation", "text": "African Wildlife Foundation\n\nThe African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), founded in 1961 as the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation, is an international conservation organization that focuses on critically important landscapes in Africa.\n\nAWF's programs and conservation strategies are designed to protect the wildlife and wild lands of Africa and ensure a more sustainable future for Africa's people. AWF stops the degradation of animals and the world's environment.\n\nSince its inception, the organization has protected endangered species and land, promoted conservation enterprises that benefit local African communities, and trained hundreds of African nationals in conservation—all to ensure the survival of Africa's unparalleled wildlife heritage.\n\nThe African Wildlife Leadership Foundation (AWLF) was founded in 1961 by Russell E. Train, a wealthy judge and hunter, and member of the Washington Safari Club.\nOther founding members from the Safari Club were Nick Arundel, a former United States Marine Corps combat officer and journalist, Kermit Roosevelt, Jr. of the CIA, James S. Bugg, a business man and Maurice Stans, later to be Richard Nixon's finance chairman.\n\nTrain was worried that European park managers would be replaced by unqualified Africans in conservation work as African countries gained their independence. Twenty African countries became independent in 1960 and 1961.\nTrain wrote \"In Tanganyika alone, the government recently ordered 100 percent Africanization of the game service by 1966! ... Replacement of European staff by untrained, unqualified men spells disaster for the game\".\nHe felt that it was urgent to train Africans to become wildlife professionals.\n\nThe first major grant of the AWLF was $47,000 to help found the College of African Wildlife Management at Mweka, Tanzania in 1963.\nThe college was organized by Bruce Kinloch, Chief Game Warden of Tanganyika, as a pioneer institution for the training of African wildlife managers.\nFunding for Mweka was also provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Frankfurt Zoological Society, with facilities donated by the government of Tanganyika.\nBy 2010 the college had trained over 4,500 wildlife managers from 28 African countries and 18 non-African countries.\n\nIn 1963 AWLF started a scholarship program to bring young Africans to American universities where they could study biology and wildlife management. The AWLF built a conservation education center in the same year, situated at the entrance to the Nairobi National Park. In 1967 the AWLF provided $50,000 to finance construction of a Research Institute in Tanzania. In 1970 the AWF established a school for wildlife management in Garoua, Cameroon, giving instruction in French.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the AWLF continued to finance students, and also assisted conservation projects, often giving supplies such as tents, vehicle spare parts, water pumps and photographic equipment rather than cash.\n\nIn 1969 the AWLF took the lead in a campaign supported by other conservation groups to protect rhinos. In 1974 the foundation began a program to study cheetahs.\nIn 1983 the AWF dropped \"Leadership\" from its name. Train was disappointed with the change, considering that the organization had lost sight of its original mandate. Instead, it had become just another conservation organization, giving funding to westerners to conduct research on animals.\nHowever, research such as Dian Fossey's work on gorillas and Cynthia Moss's work on elephants, both supported by the AWF, was clearly useful.\n\nThe foundation struggled to raise money.\nIn 1968 the annual budget was less than US$250,000.\nIn 1988, the year in which the AWF launched a campaign against elephant poaching, the foundation had a staff of six and an annual budget of just $2 million.\nWhen the AWF turned 30 in 1991, the board of trustees continued to be dominated by prominent and wealthy Americans, many of whom served on other non-profit boards.\n\nIn more recent years the AWF has modelled its program around three objectives: empowering people, conserving wildlife and protecting land. Empowering people involves conservation enterprises that provide benefits and incentives to local communities, sponsoring training of African conservationists and working with government to define conservation policy.\nConserving wildlife involves research into species and into how these species interact with people, the basis for defining programs from which both humans and animals can benefit.\n\nThe main thrust, however, is on protecting land, ensuring that large open landscapes are available for wildlife.\nThis involves supporting existing protected areas, creating private land trusts and working with local community groups on protecting special sites. Starting in 1998, land protection efforts focused on landscape-level conservation approaches. \n\nThe foundation had income of US$19,333,998 in the fiscal year ended 30 June 2009. Of this, $8,582,555 came from public sector support, $5,815,839 from corporate and foundation support, $5,224,931 from gifts from individuals and $1,360,424 from legacy gifts.\n$17,395,456 was spent on programs, $1,524,764 on fund raising and $1,262,056 in administration.\nProgram funding broke down as $14,174,224 on conservation programs, $2,392,989 on public education and $828,243 on membership programs.\n\nAWF used to call the landscapes that it supports \"heartlands\"; now, the organization employs a \"priority landscape\" approach.\nHeartlands include:\nPriority Landscapes include:\n\nThe Bili-Uele Protected Area Complex is found in the remote north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, along the border of the Central African Republic. The region consists of savanna mosaic north of the Uele River and lowland primary forest to the south. Both regions support exceptional biodiversity, including forest elephants, lions, as well as the last remaining undisturbed population of the eastern chimpanzee. An estimated 35,000–65,000 eastern chimpanzees are found in this complex. However, very little is known about the Bili-Uele area, and few organizations are working there.\n\nThe Maringa-Lopori-Wamba Landscape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo one of the least developed and most remote parts of the Congo Basin.\nThe inhabitants are among the poorest in Africa, depending on natural resources to meet their basic needs.\nMost of the people live by slash-and-burn agriculture, and rely on bushmeat such as porcupine, sitatunga, and forest hog for protein.\nCash crops include maize, cassave and groundnuts.\nThe growing population is placing more stress on the environment, and there is risk of a revival of logging that could harm the ability of the land to sustain the people and could jeopardize both biodiversity.\n\nSince 1973 a Japanese team has been researching the bonobo population near the village of Wamba in 1973.\nHowever, research was discontinued after political disorders started in 1991 followed by civil war in 1997, resuming only in the mid-2000s.\nThe IUCN Red List classifies bonobos as an endangered species with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals.\nThe AWF has led efforts by local and international groups to develop a sustainable land use plan for the MLW Landscape.\nThe plan aims to ensure that the economic and cultural needs of the inhabitants are met while conserving the environment.\nThe approach combines AWF's Landscape Conservation Process and the Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) Program Monitoring Plan.\nA variety of tools are used including surveys, interviews with local people and satellite image interpretation.\n\nThe Etosha-Skeleton Coast landscape, in the northern part of Namibia, is home to Etosha National Park and its vast salt pan, woodland, and savanna ecosystems. The landscape is home to a diverse range of wildlife, from the black-faced impala to the desert-dwelling oryx to more commonly known animals such as the elephant, wild dog, lion, and cheetah. Possibly, most importantly, to the west of the park lies the Skeleton Coast, where herds of elephants roam. African Wildlife Foundation is scaling up social venture capital investments through its subsidiary, African Wildlife Capital (AWC), which invests in socially and environmentally responsible businesses, such as the Grootberg Lodge in the Khoadi-Hoas community conservancy. These businesses must comply with conservation covenants, ensuring that they are sustainable and improving livelihoods for people and habitats for wildlife.\n\nAt the core of the Faro landscape in northern Cameroon is Faro National Park, located close to the Nigerian border. Not only does this park host the largest population of hippos in Cameroon, it is also home to elephants, black rhinos, cheetahs, hyenas, and other wildlife. AWF is lending support to counter-poaching park rangers in Faro and building a contingent of community scouts on the park's borders to provide a needed buffer between outsiders and the park.\n\nThe Great Fish River Nature Reserve is located in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. The 45,000-hectare reserve, which lies in the Great Fish River valley, is home to an important and increasingly vulnerable population of critically endangered black rhino.\n\nThe floodplains of the Zambezi River are surrounded by a mosaic of miombo and mopane woodlands and grasslands that include important wildlife migration corridors.\nThe Victoria Falls, the largest in the world, are between Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia and Victoria Falls National Park in Zimbabwe.\nThe Falls and surrounding area are designated a World Heritage Site.\nHowever, the environment is threatened by growing and haphazard development of tourism, and lack of funding to the park authorities.\n\nThe AWF has established the Sekute Conservation Area in this region in partnership with the Sekute Chiefdom, holding two elephant corridors.\nAWF helped wildlife authorities settle four new white rhinos in Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in Zambia, joining the last surviving white rhino in the country, a bull.\nOn 17 January 2011 it was reported that two of the female white rhinos had given birth to calves, which seemed healthy.\nThe area is also home to endangered black rhinos.\nIn 2011 a cluster of modern new buildings for the Lupani community school were opened in Kazungula, built by the AWF at a cost of US$250,000.\nThe new school has six classrooms, offices and five teachers' houses with three bedrooms each.\n\nDisney released the movie \"African Cats\" in April 2011. The Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund gave AWF a portion of the proceeds from the first week's ticket sales for use in protecting the Amboseli Wildlife Corridor. Their \"See 'African Cats,' Save the Savanna\" program served both to promote the movie and to raise money for conservation.\n\nThe Limpopo Landscape includes areas of Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nIt includes savanna, woodland, rivers and floodplains.\nFauna include sable antelope, rhinos, hippos, and many species of birds, insects and aquatic life.\nThe AWF has started the Leopard Conservation Science Project in this landscape .\nThe AWF is particularly involved in the Banhine National Park in Mozambique, which covers .\nUntil recently this park had little or no infrastructure or staff to ensure that the environment was protected.\nThe AWF has built a conservation research center, which it is marketing to the international scientific community.\nFees from researchers will pay for staff to run the center and to manage the park.\n\nThe Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP) is a park that is being established to connect the Kruger National Park in South Africa, the Limpopo National Park in Mozambique, the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe and other protected areas.\nIt is almost the size of the Netherlands and more than three times larger than the Yellowstone National Park.\nThe GLTP is home to many of the species most popular with tourists, including lion, white and black rhinoceros, giraffe, elephant, hippopotamus and buffalo.\nThe AWF says the megapark will result in \"creating new jobs and fortifying a tourism base not yet meeting its full potential\".\nThe AWF is a major sponsor of the project that is setting up this park.\n\nThe Manyara Ranch Conservancy is near to Lake Manyara in Tanzania.\nThis is a pioneering conservation and tourism project supported by the African Wildlife Foundation, the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust and the Manyara Ranch Conservancy. While not a park, the conservancy is frequented by resident and migrating wildlife including elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard and the more common plains game. Rarely seen in the parks but a common resident on the Conservancy is the lesser kudu.\n\nWithin Kenya's Rift Valley, sits the Mau Forest Complex. It is the largest indigenous montane forest in East Africa and serves as a critical water catchment area for the country, providing a source of water for many of Kenya's wildlife and people. African Wildlife Foundation, together with the Kenya Forest Service, the Community Forest Association, and other stakeholders, is reforesting areas of the Mau Forest with indigenous trees.\n\nThis region is located around the point where Niger, Burkina Faso and Benin meet.\nIt consists of three national protected parks that form a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the trans-national W National Park, as well as several adjacent reserves and buffer zones.\nThe complex includes savanna woodlands, gallery forests and flooded plains where the Mekrou and Niver rivers meet.\nIt is home to large and diverse wildlife populations including the largest population of elephants in the region and the only remaining West African giraffes.\nMitochondrial and nuclear DNA research shows that this is a distinct and genetically healthy subspecies that diverged from the Rothschild's giraffe about 350,000 years ago.\n\nIn Parc W, AWF and other International NGOs such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature, World Wide Fund for Nature and Africa 70 play a central role in communication, education and organization of local communities and their leaders, and help collect socio-economic and technical data.\nAWF is helping fund tree nurseries in Niger and Burkino Faso for replantings to provide fodder for the giraffes. Conservation threats are human population growth and desertification. AWF partners in the region include the Association pour la Sauvegarde des Girafes du Niger, Centre National de Gestion des Réserves de Faune (CENAGREF), Benin and the Ministries of the Environment in Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nThe Ruaha area will intersect with an agriculture corridor that the Tanzanian government wants to develop in southern Tanzania. The proposed corridor will overlap many different ecosystems, possibly undermining their ecological integrity and impacting wildlife areas. AWF is scaling up social venture capital investments through its subsidiary, African Wildlife Capital (AWC), which invests in socially and environmentally responsible agricultural and other businesses—such as the Rungwe Avocado Co.—that must comply with conservation covenants to secure and maintain investment. These AWC-invested businesses not only aim to benefit wildlife, but also benefit small-farm holders.\n\nThe national parks, private ranches, and communal lands of the Samburu Landscape support some of Africa's most impressive wildlife. The Grevy's zebra and reticulated giraffe, species that are found only north of the Equator in Africa, roam in the Samburu Landscape among the acacia grasslands. The unique conservation challenges faced in Samburu are forest/habitat degradation due to logging and farming and cattle-carnivore conflict.\n\nAWF has implemented solutions to address these challenges, including partnering with Starbucks Coffee Trading Co. to train coffee growers in sustainable and more productive practices, providing wildlife scouts with monitoring technology, and working with Samburu warriors to protect endangered predators.\n\nThe Virunga landscape is an area of volcanic highlands around the point where Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo meet, Virunga is home to the last 700 mountain gorillas in the world.\nIt includes the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park in Uganda, where AWF opened a visitor center in July 2006.\nThe Virunga ecosystem is highly diverse, and also shelters chimpanzees, golden monkeys, forest elephants, and many species of birds, reptiles and amphibians.\nThe region is overpopulated, intensely poor and politically unstable, placing severe threats on the environment.\n\nThe AWF helped Dian Fossey study Rwandan mountain gorillas in the 1960s.\nAWF President Robinson McIlvaine later said that \"There would be no mountain gorillas in the Virungas today ... were it not for Dian Fossey's tireless efforts over many years\".\nMcIlvaine initiated formation of a consortium to protect the threatened Rwandan mountain gorillas while he was president of the AWF between 1978 and 1982.\nMore recently, the AWF coordinated fundraising and construction of a lodge overlooking the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, home of about half the worlds population of mountain gorillas.\n\nAccording to Farley Mowat in his book \"Woman in the Mists\", in the late 1970s Fossey asked McIlvaine to temporarily serve as secretary-treasurer of the Digit Fund while he was AWF President.\nShe had created the fund to finance patrols against poachers seeking to kill mountain gorillas. McIlvaine partnered with the International Primate Protection League, the Digit Fund, and his own AWF asking for funds, to be made out to the AWF.\nThe Digit Fund received none of the money. When McIlvaine suggested to Fossey that the Digit Fund could be folded into AWF, Fossey declined and McIlvaine resigned as secretary-treasurer of the fund.\n\nThe AWF is a co-sponsor of the International Gorilla Conservation Program (IGCP) in Virunga, the others being Fauna & Flora International (FFI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Among other activities, the IGCP works with Virunga Artisans, which markets handmade products of artisans who live near the Volcanoes, Mgahinga and Bwindi National Parks.\nA census of mountain gorillas in the Virunga Massif in March and April 2010 showed that there had been a 26.3% increase in the population over the past seven years, an encouraging sign that conservation efforts were succeeding.\n\nThe Save Valley landscape was once dominated by a large livestock operation that pushed out native wildlife and degraded much of the ecosystem. During recent decades, cattle fences and livestock have been removed, and the landscape has seen a resurgence of wildlife and a recovery of the wild habitats.\n\nThe Save Valley Conservancy, in Zimbabwe's southern lowveld area forms part of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Here, lions, buffalo, leopard, elephant, and other game, including black and white rhinos, find their home. AWF supports Save Valley Conservancy's anti-poaching efforts and works with government partners to ensure the protection of Save's wildlife, namely its rhino populations.\n\nThe African Wildlife Foundation headquarters are in Nairobi, Kenya with offices in South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Washington, DC.\nThe organization is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of 2009 there were 36 members of the Board and 132 paid staff.\nFunds are raised through direct mail, grant proposals, Internet appeals, planned giving, cause-related marketing, and membership appeals.\nThe executive heads of the foundation have been:\nThe AWF is a member of International Conservation Caucus Foundation's Conservation Council.\nIt is also a member of EarthShare, a national federation that supports leading American environmental and conservation charities.\n\n"}

The project includes a book series in several volumes and the online database Dodis.\n\nIn contrast to other editions on foreign policy, Dodis is not a state-run project, but the product of academic research. The research group chooses the documents to be published according to independently defined criteria and is only bound to scientific principles. Through their choice of published documents, the researchers aim to show the main features of the international relations of Switzerland while maintaining its diversity. The basic research done by Dodis provides historians with primary sources allowing them to work on specific aspects of Swiss foreign policy or to contextualise more complex developments.\n\nDiplomatic Documents of Switzerland is an enterprise of the Swiss Academy for Humanities and Social Sciences (SAGW) and works under the auspices of the Swiss Society for History (SSH). The funding and the administration of the project were taken over by the academy in January 2000 from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF), which had until then been the major financial contributor to Dodis. Furthermore, the project is supported by the Swiss Federal Archives (SFA), where the Research Centre is located and by the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA). The research centre of Diplomatic Documents of Switzerland is managed by a director. The director is accountable to the Dodis-Committee, which consists of representatives of the contributing organisations and of professors from all of the History departments in Switzerland.\n\nIn 1972 a group of historians took the initiative to publish documents for the study of Swiss foreign policy and of the international relations of Switzerland. Fifteen volumes covering the period from 1848 until 1945 were subsequently published between 1979 and 1997. Each volume was published by a different team of researchers based at a Swiss university. The project was restructured in the mid 1990s: in the course of planning the second series of the Dodis and an online-database, the various and changing research teams were replaced by a permanent research centre with assigned staff. The work on the second series of the Dodis, covering the period from 1945 until 1989, started in 1997 and at the same time, the database dodis.ch went online.\n\nDodis.ch is an integrative and freely accessible internet database of Diplomatic Documents of Switzerland (Dodis). It contains thousands of documentes, primarily sourced from the Swiss Federal Archives, which are all related to Swiss foreign relations. The database also links meta-data regarding persons and organisations important to international and Swiss history. Sources can thus be critically contextualised and research can be extended to other Dodis documents as well as the relevant archival holdings. The relational database works in addition to the printed volumes and aims to illustrate in more detail the various aspects of Swiss international relations. The thousands of documents on dodis.ch are, contrary to those in the volumes, not annotated, but indexed and tagged according to scientific criteria. The documents on dodis.ch are scans and can be downloaded in pdf format.\n\nThe book series in several volumes aims to illustrate the main features and the guidelines of the international relations of Switzerland. The documents printed in the volumes, therefore, primarily either show the general orientation of Swiss foreign relations or indicate what at a certain time strongly influenced this orientation. \nFrom 1979 until 1997 the first series was published in fifteen volumes covering the period from 1848 until 1945. These volumes were later digitalised and can be accessed on the Swiss Federal Archives' search engine publications officielles numérisées, which uses full text search. The second series covering the period from 1945 until 1989 is to be completed by 2020 and is planned to be published in fifteen volumes, as well. The most recent Volume (Vol. 26 1973-75) was published 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "142056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142056", "title": "Madonna (entertainer)", "text": "Madonna (entertainer)\n\nMadonna Louise Ciccone (; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter, actress and businesswoman. Referred to as the \"Queen of Pop\" since the 1980s, Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of songwriting in mainstream popular music, as well as imagery in music videos and on stage. She has also frequently reinvented both her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry. Besides sparking controversy, her works have been praised by music critics. Madonna is often cited as an influence by other artists.\n\nBorn and raised in Michigan, Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, Madonna signed with Sire Records in 1982 and released her eponymous debut album the next year. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including the global bestsellers \"Like a Virgin\" (1984) and \"True Blue\" (1986), as well as the Grammy Award winners \"Ray of Light\" (1998) and \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" (2005). Throughout her career, Madonna has written and produced most of her songs, with many of them reaching number one on the record charts, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"La Isla Bonita\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Take a Bow\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\".\n\nMadonna's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as \"Desperately Seeking Susan\" (1985), \"Dick Tracy\" (1990), \"A League of Their Own\" (1992), and \"Evita\" (1996). While the latter earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded her own entertainment company Maverick, including the label Maverick Records, in 1992. Her other ventures include fashion design, writing children's books, opening of health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributed in various charities and founded Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006.\n\nHaving sold more than 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is noted as the best-selling female recording artist of all time by \"Guinness World Records\". The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed her as the second highest-certified female artist in the U.S., with 64.5 million album units. According to \"Billboard\", Madonna is the most successful solo artist in its Hot 100 chart history. She is also the highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time, accumulating U.S. $1.4 billion from her concert tickets. Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility, Madonna topped VH1's countdown of 100 Greatest Women in Music. Additionally, \"Rolling Stone\" listed her among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.\n\nMadonna was born to Catholic parents Madonna Louise (\"née\" Fortin) and Silvio Anthony \"Tony\" Ciccone in Bay City, Michigan on August 16, 1958. Her father's parents were Italian emigrants from Pacentro, while her mother was of French-Canadian descent. Tony worked as an engineer designer for Chrysler and General Motors. Since Madonna had the same name as her mother, family members called her \"Little Nonni\". She has two elder brothers, Anthony and Martin, and three younger siblings, Paula, Christopher, and Melanie.\n\nUpon being confirmed in the Catholic Church in 1966, she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name. She was raised in the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills). Months before her mother died of breast cancer at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason. Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.\n\nMadonna turned to her paternal grandmother for solace. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and rebelled against anyone brought into their home who they thought would try to take the place of their beloved mother. Madonna later told \"Vanity Fair\" that she saw herself in her youth as a \"lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades... I wanted to be somebody.\" Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.\nIn 1966, Tony married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him, which strained their relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.\n\nMadonna's father put her in classical piano lessons, but she later convinced him to allow her to take ballet lessons. Christopher Flynn, her ballet teacher, persuaded her to pursue a career in dance. She later attended Rochester Adams High School where she became a straight-A student and a member of the cheerleading squad. After graduating, she received a dance scholarship to the University of Michigan.\n\nIn 1978, Madonna dropped out of college and relocated to New York City. She had little money while working as a waitress at Dunkin' Donuts and with modern dance troupes, taking classes at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and eventually performing with Pear Lang Dance Theater. Madonna said of her move to New York, \"It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done.\" She started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. Madonna claimed that one night, while returning from a rehearsal, a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform fellatio. She later found the incident to be \"a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it.\"\n\nWhile performing as a backup singer and dancer for the French disco artist Patrick Hernandez on his 1979 world tour, Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy and they lived in an abandoned synagogue in Corona, Queens. Together, they formed her first rock band, the Breakfast Club, for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar. In 1980 or 1981 she left Breakfast Club and, with her then boyfriend Stephen Bray as drummer, formed the band Emmy. The two began writing songs together, but Madonna later decided to promote herself as a solo act. Her music impressed DJ and record producer Mark Kamins who arranged a meeting between Madonna and Sire Records founder Seymour Stein.\n\nAfter Madonna signed a singles deal with Sire, her debut single, \"Everybody\", was released in October 1982, and the second, \"Burning Up\", in March 1983. Both became big club hits in the United States, reaching number three on Hot Dance Club Songs chart compiled by \"Billboard\" magazine. After this success, she started developing her eponymous debut album, \"Madonna\", which was primarily produced by Reggie Lucas of Warner Bros. However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas' production techniques, so decided to seek additional help.\n\nMadonna moved in with boyfriend John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, asking his help for finishing the album's production. Benitez remixed most of the tracks and produced \"Holiday\", which was her third single and her first international top-ten hit. The overall sound of \"Madonna\" was dissonant and in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, using some of the new technology of the time, like the Linn drum machine, Moog bass and the OB-X synthesizer. The album was released in July 1983 and peaked at number eight on the \"Billboard\" 200 six months later, in 1984. It yielded two top-ten singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, \"Borderline\" and \"Lucky Star\".\nMadonna's look and style of dressing, her performances, and her music videos influenced young girls and women. Her style became one of the female fashion trends of the 1980s. Created by stylist and jewelry designer Maripol, the look consisted of lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, jewelry bearing the crucifix, bracelets, and bleached hair. Madonna's popularity continued to rise globally with the release of her second studio album, \"Like a Virgin\", in November 1984. It became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the US. \"Like a Virgin\" became the very first album by a female to sell over five million copies in the U.S. It was later certified diamond, and has sold over 21 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe album's title track served as its first single, and topped the Hot 100 chart for six consecutive weeks. It attracted the attention of conservative organizations who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined family values, and moralists sought to have the song and video banned. Madonna received huge media coverage for her performance of \"Like a Virgin\" at the first 1984 MTV Video Music Awards. Wearing a wedding dress and white gloves, Madonna appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake and then rolled around suggestively on the floor. MTV retrospectively considered it one of the \"most iconic\" pop performances of all time. The second single, \"Material Girl\", reached number two on the Hot 100 and was promoted by a music video recreating Marilyn Monroe's performance of \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\" from the 1953 film \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\". While filming this video, Madonna started dating actor Sean Penn. They married on her birthday in 1985.\nMadonna entered mainstream films in February 1985, beginning with a brief appearance as a club singer in \"Vision Quest\", a romantic drama film. Its soundtrack contained two new singles, her U.S. number-one single, \"Crazy for You\", and another track \"Gambler\". She also played the title role in the 1985 comedy \"Desperately Seeking Susan\", a film which introduced the song \"Into the Groove\", her first number-one single in the UK. Her popularity relegated the film as a Madonna vehicle, despite not having lead actress billing. \"The New York Times\" film critic Vincent Canby named it one of the ten best films of 1985.\n\nBeginning in April 1985, Madonna embarked on her first concert tour in North America, The Virgin Tour, with the Beastie Boys as her opening act. She progressed from playing CBGB and the Mudd Club to playing large sporting arenas. The tour saw the peak of Madonna wannabe phenomenon, with lots of female attendees dressing like her. At that time, she released two more hits, \"Angel\" and \"Dress You Up\", making all four singles from the album peak inside the top five on the Hot 100 chart. In July, \"Penthouse\" and \"Playboy\" magazines published a number of nude photos of Madonna, taken in New York in 1978. She had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time, and was paid as little as $25 a session. The publication of the photos caused a media uproar, but Madonna remained \"unapologetic and defiant\". The photographs were ultimately sold for up to $100,000. She referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor Live Aid charity concert, saying that she would not take her jacket off because \"[the media] might hold it against me ten years from now.\"\n\nIn June 1986, Madonna released her third studio album, \"True Blue\", which was inspired by and dedicated to Sean Penn. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine was generally impressed with the effort, writing that the album \"sound[s] as if it comes from the heart\". Five singles were released from the album—\"Live to Tell\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"True Blue\", \"Open Your Heart\", and \"La Isla Bonita\"—all of which reached number one in the United States or the United Kingdom. The album topped the charts in 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time, and became her best-selling studio album of her career with sales of 25 million copies. \"True Blue\" was featured in the 1992 edition of \"Guinness World Records\" as the best-selling album by a woman of all time.\nMadonna starred in the critically panned film \"Shanghai Surprise\" in 1986, for which she received her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. She made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe's \"Goose and Tom-Tom\"; the film and play both co-starred Penn. The next year, Madonna was featured in the film \"Who's That Girl\". She contributed four songs to its soundtrack, including the title track and \"Causing a Commotion\". Madonna embarked on the Who's That Girl World Tour in July 1987, which continued until September. It broke several attendance records, including over 130,000 people in a show near Paris, which was then a record for the highest-attended female concert of all time. Later that year, she released a remix album of past hits, titled \"You Can Dance\", which reached number 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200. After an annulment in December 1987, Madonna filed for divorce from Penn in January 1989, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nIn January 1989, Madonna signed an endorsement deal with soft-drink manufacturer, Pepsi. In one of her Pepsi commercials, she debuted \"Like a Prayer\", the lead single from her fourth studio album of same name. The corresponding music video featured many Catholic symbols such as stigmata and cross burning, and a dream of making love to a saint, leading the Vatican to condemn the video. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and boycott Pepsi products. Pepsi revoked the commercial and canceled her sponsorship contract. \"Like a Prayer\" topped the charts in many countries, becoming her seventh number one on the Hot 100.\n\nMadonna co-wrote and co-produced \"Like a Prayer\" with Patrick Leonard, Stephen Bray, and Prince. Music critic J. D. Considine from \"Rolling Stone\" hailed the album \"as close to art as pop music gets ... proof not only that Madonna should be taken seriously as an artist but that hers is one of the most compelling voices of the Eighties.\" \"Like a Prayer\" peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 and sold 15 million copies worldwide. Other successful singles from the album were \"Express Yourself\" and \"Cherish\", both peaked at number two in the US, as well as the UK top-five \"Dear Jessie\" and the US top-ten \"Keep It Together\". By the end of the 1980s, Madonna was named as the \"Artist of the Decade\" by MTV, \"Billboard\" and \"Musician\" magazine.\n\nMadonna starred as Breathless Mahoney in the film \"Dick Tracy\" (1990), with Warren Beatty playing the title role. The film went to number one on the U.S. box office for two weeks and Madonna received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. To accompany the film, she released the soundtrack album, \"I'm Breathless\", which included songs inspired by the film's 1930s setting. It also featured the U.S. number-one song \"Vogue\" and \"Sooner or Later\". While shooting the film, Madonna began a relationship with Beatty, which dissolved by the end of 1990.\nIn April 1990, Madonna began her Blond Ambition World Tour, which was held until August. \"Rolling Stone\" called it an \"elaborately choreographed, sexually provocative extravaganza\" and proclaimed it \"the best tour of 1990\". The tour generated strong negative reaction from religious groups for her performance of \"Like a Virgin\", during which two male dancers caressed her body before she simulated masturbation. In response, Madonna said, \"The tour in no way hurts anybody's sentiments. It's for open minds and gets them to see sexuality in a different way. Their own and others\". The live recording of the tour won Madonna her first Grammy Award, in the category of Best Long Form Music Video.\n\n\"The Immaculate Collection\", Madonna's first greatest-hits compilation album, was released in November 1990. It included two new songs, \"Justify My Love\" and \"Rescue Me\". The album was certified diamond by RIAA and sold over 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling compilation album by a solo artist in history. \"Justify My Love\" reached number one in the U.S. becoming her ninth number-one Its music video featured scenes of sadomasochism, bondage, same-sex kissing, and brief nudity. The video was deemed too sexually explicit for MTV and was banned from the network.\n\nIn December 1990 Madonna decided to leave Jennifer Lynch's film, \"Boxing Helena\", which she had previously agreed to star in, without any explanation to the producers. Around this time, Madonna had an eight-month relationship with rapper Vanilla Ice; he ended their relationship because of Madonna's \"Sex\" book. Her first documentary film, \"\" (known as \"In Bed with Madonna\" outside North America), was released in May 1991. Chronicling her Blond Ambition World Tour, it became the highest-grossing documentary of all time (surpassed eleven years later by Michael Moore's \"Bowling for Columbine\").\n\nIn 1992, Madonna starred in \"A League of Their Own\" as Mae Mordabito, a baseball player on an all-women's team. It reached number one on the box-office and became the tenth highest-grossing film of the year in the U.S. She recorded the film's theme song, \"This Used to Be My Playground\", which became her tenth Hot 100 number-one hit, the most by any female artist at the time. The same year, she founded her own entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60 million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, the highest rate in the industry at the time, equaled only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony.\n\nThe first two projects released simultaneously from the venture were Madonna's fifth studio album, \"Erotica\", and her coffee table book, \"Sex\". Consisting of sexually provocative and explicit images, photographed by Steven Meisel, the book received strong negative reaction from the media and the general public, but sold 1.5 million copies at $50 each in a matter of days. The widespread backlash overshadowed \"Erotica\", which ended up as her lowest selling album at the time. Despite positive reviews, it became her first studio album since her debut album not to score any chart-topper in the U.S. The album entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number two and yielded the Hot 100 top-ten hits \"Erotica\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\". Madonna continued her provocative imagery in the 1993 erotic thriller, \"Body of Evidence\", a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics. She also starred in the film \"Dangerous Game\", which was released straight to video in North America. \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"angry and painful, and the pain feels real.\"\nIn September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit book, album and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that \"she had gone too far\" and that her career was over.\n\nBiographer J. Randy Taraborrelli described her ballad \"I'll Remember\" (1994) as an attempt to tone down her provocative image. The song was recorded for Alek Keshishian's film \"With Honors\". She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction in order to sustain her popularity. With her sixth studio album, \"Bedtime Stories\" (1994), Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception. The album debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200 and generated two U.S. top-five hits, \"Secret\" and \"Take a Bow\", the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks, the longest period of any Madonna single. \"Something to Remember\", a collection of ballads, was released in November 1995. The album featured three new songs: \"You'll See\", \"One More Chance\", and a cover of Marvin Gaye's \"I Want You\". Around this time Madonna started dating rapper Tupac Shakur, but it ended in 1994. Next year, Shakur revealed in a letter to Madonna that he ended the relationship because she was white. She later became romantically involved with fitness trainer Carlos Leon.\n\nIn the 1996 musical, \"Evita\", Madonna played the title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to director Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, \"This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because it was much more than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of \"Evita\" than anything else I have done.\" After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During filming Madonna became ill several times, after finding out that she was pregnant, and from the intense emotional effort required with the scenes. After \"Evita\"s release in December 1996, Madonna's performance was praised by film critics. Zach Conner from \"Time\" magazine commented, \"It's a relief to say that \"Evita\" is pretty damn fine, well cast and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations.\" Madonna won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for the role.\n\nThe \"Evita\" soundtrack, containing songs mostly performed by Madonna, was released as a double album. It included \"You Must Love Me\" and \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\"; the latter reached number one in countries across Europe. Madonna was presented with the Artist Achievement Award by Tony Bennett at the 1996 \"Billboard\" Music Awards. On October 14, 1996, she gave birth to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, her daughter with Leon. Biographer Mary Cross writes that although Madonna often worried that her pregnancy would harm \"Evita\", she reached some important personal goals: \"Now 38 years old, Madonna had at last triumphed on screen and achieved her dream of having a child, both in the same year. She had reached another turning point in her career, reinventing herself and her image with the public.\" Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997 and she declared that they were \"better off as best friends\".\n\nAfter Lourdes's birth, Madonna became involved in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, introduced to her by actress Sandra Bernhard. Her seventh studio album, \"Ray of Light\", (1998) reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronica producer William Orbit and wanted to create a sound that could blend dance music with pop and British rock. American music critic Ann Powers explained that what Madonna searched for with Orbit \"was a kind of a lushness that she wanted for this record. Techno and rave were happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard stuff like Aphex Twin. There was party stuff like Fatboy Slim. That's not what Madonna wanted for this. She wanted something more like a singer-songwriter, really. And William Orbit provided her with that.\"\nThe album garnered critical acclaim, with \"Slant Magazine\" calling it \"one of the great pop masterpieces of the '90s\" \"Ray of Light\" was honored with four Grammy Awards—including Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recording—and was nominated for both Album of the Year and Record of the Year. \"Rolling Stone\" listed it among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Commercially, the album peaked at number-one in numerous countries and sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. The album's lead single, \"Frozen\", became Madonna's first single to debut at number one in the UK, while in the U.S. it became her sixth number-two single, setting another record for Madonna as the artist with the most number two hits. The second single, \"Ray of Light\", debuted at number five on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The 1998 edition of \"Guinness Book of World Records\" documented that \"no female artist has sold more records than Madonna around the world\".\n\nMadonna founded Ray of Light Foundation which focused on women, education, global development and humanitarian. She signed on to play a violin teacher in the 1999 film \"Music of the Heart\" but left the project, citing \"creative differences\" with director Wes Craven. She recorded the single \"Beautiful Stranger\" for the 1999 film \"\", which earned her a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Madonna starred in the 2000 film \"The Next Best Thing\", and contributed two songs to the film's soundtrack; \"Time Stood Still\" and a cover of Don McLean's 1971 song \"American Pie\".\n\nMadonna released her eighth studio album, \"Music\", in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired \"Ray of Light\" era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: \"I love to work with the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. \"Music\" is the future of sound.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that \"\"Music\" blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as \"Ray of Light\".\" The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., \"Music\" debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since \"Like a Prayer\". It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number-one \"Music\", \"Don't Tell Me\", and \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\". The music video of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.\n\nShe first met director Guy Ritchie, who would later become her second husband, in the summer of 1998 and gave birth to their son Rocco John Ritchie on August 11, 2000 in Los Angeles. Rocco and Madonna suffered complications from the birth due to her experiencing placenta praevia. He was christened at Dornoch Cathedral in Dornoch, Scotland, on December 21, 2000. Madonna married Ritchie the following day at nearby Skibo Castle. After an eight-year absence of touring, Madonna started her Drowned World Tour in June 2001. The tour visited cities in the U.S. and Europe and was the highest-grossing concert tour of the year by a solo artist, earning $75 million from 47 sold-out shows. She also released her second greatest-hits collection, titled \"GHV2\", to coincide with the home video release of the tour. \"GHV2\" debuted at number seven on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nMadonna starred in the film \"Swept Away\", directed by Ritchie. Released direct-to-video in the UK, the film was a commercial and critical failure. In May 2002 she appeared in London in the West End play \"Up For Grabs\" at the Wyndhams Theatre (billed as 'Madonna Ritchie'), to universally bad reviews and was described as \"the evening's biggest disappointment\" by one. That October, she released \"Die Another Day\", the title song of the James Bond film \"Die Another Day\", in which she had a cameo role, described by Peter Bradshaw from \"The Guardian\" as \"incredibly wooden\". The song reached number eight on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and was nominated for both a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Raspberry for Worst Song.\n\nFollowing \"Die Another Day\", Madonna collaborated with fashion photographer Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from a photo shoot in \"W\" magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery and also traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, \"American Life\", which was based on her observations of American society. She explained that the record was \"like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued and all the things that were important to me.\" Larry Flick from \"The Advocate\" felt that \"\"American Life\" is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent\" while condemning it as \"a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously.\" The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the clip, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at war with Iraq. With four million copies sold worldwide, \"American Life\" was the lowest-selling album of her career at that point.\nMadonna gave another provocative performance later that year at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, when she kissed singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera while singing the track \"Hollywood\". In October 2003, she provided guest vocals on Spears' single \"Me Against the Music\". It was followed with the release of \"Remixed & Revisited\". The EP contained remixed versions of songs from \"American Life\" and included \"Your Honesty\", a previously unreleased track from the \"Bedtime Stories\" recording sessions. Madonna also signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment to be the author of five children's books. The first of these books, titled \"The English Roses\", was published in September 2003. The story was about four English schoolgirls and their envy and jealousy of each other. The book debuted at the top of \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list and became the fastest-selling children's picture book of all time.\n\nThe next year Madonna and Maverick sued Warner Music Group and its former parent company Time Warner, claiming that mismanagement of resources and poor bookkeeping had cost the company millions of dollars. In return, Warner filed a countersuit alleging that Maverick had lost tens of millions of dollars on its own. The dispute was resolved when the Maverick shares, owned by Madonna and Ronnie Dashev, were purchased by Warner. Madonna and Dashev's company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music, but Madonna was still signed to Warner under a separate recording contract.\n\nIn mid-2004 Madonna embarked on the Re-Invention World Tour in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. It became the highest-grossing tour of 2004, earning around $120 million and became the subject of her documentary \"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret\". In November 2004, she was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as one of its five founding members, along with the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Bob Marley, and U2. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked her at number 36 on its special issue of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, featuring an article about her written by Britney Spears. In January 2005, Madonna performed a cover version of the John Lennon song \"Imagine\" at Tsunami Aid. She also performed at the Live 8 benefit concert in London in July 2005.\nHer tenth studio album, \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\", was released in November 2005. Musically the album was structured like a club set composed by a DJ. It was acclaimed by critics, with Keith Caulfield from \"Billboard\" commenting that the album was a \"welcome return to form for the Queen of Pop.\" The album won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album. \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" and its lead single, \"Hung Up\", went on to reach number one in 40 and 41 countries respectively, earning a place in \"Guinness World Records\". The song contained a sample of ABBA's \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", only the second time that ABBA has allowed their work to be used. ABBA songwriter Björn Ulvaeus remarked \"It is a wonderful track—100 per cent solid pop music.\" \"Sorry\", the second single, became Madonna's twelfth number-one single in the UK.\n\nMadonna embarked on the Confessions Tour in May 2006, which had a global audience of 1.2 million and grossed over $193.7 million, becoming the highest-grossing tour to that date for a female artist. Madonna used religious symbols, such as the crucifix and Crown of Thorns, in the performance of \"Live to Tell\". It caused the Russian Orthodox Church and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia to urge all their members to boycott her concert. At the same time, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) announced officially that Madonna had sold over 200 million copies of her albums alone worldwide.\n\nWhile on tour Madonna founded charitable organization Raising Malawi and partially funded an orphanage in and traveling to that country. While there, she decided to adopt a boy named David Banda in October 2006. The adoption raised strong public reaction, because Malawian law requires would-be parents to reside in Malawi for one year before adopting, which Madonna did not do. She addressed this on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", saying that there were no written adoption laws in Malawi that regulated foreign adoption. She described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis when she first met him. Banda's biological father, Yohane, commented, \"These so-called human rights activists are harassing me every day, threatening me that I am not aware of what I am doing ... They want me to support their court case, a thing I cannot do for I know what I agreed with Madonna and her husband.\" The adoption was finalized in May 2008.\n\nMadonna released and performed the song \"Hey You\" at the London Live Earth concert in July 2007. She announced her departure from Warner Bros. Records, and declared a new $120 million, ten-year 360 deal with Live Nation. In 2008, Madonna produced and wrote \"I Am Because We Are\", a documentary on the problems faced by Malawians; it was directed by Nathan Rissman, who worked as Madonna's gardener. She also directed her first film \"Filth and Wisdom\". The plot of the film revolved around three friends and their aspirations. \"The Times\" said she had \"done herself proud\" while \"The Daily Telegraph\" described the film as \"not an entirely unpromising first effort [but] Madonna would do well to hang on to her day job.\" On March 10, 2008, Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in her first year of eligibility. She did not sing at the ceremony but asked fellow Hall of Fame inductees and Michigan natives The Stooges to perform her songs \"Burning Up\" and \"Ray of Light\".\n\nMadonna released her eleventh studio album, \"Hard Candy\", in April 2008. Containing R&B and urban pop influences, the songs on \"Hard Candy\" were autobiographical in nature and saw Madonna collaborating with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Nate \"Danja\" Hills. The album debuted at number one in 37 countries and on the \"Billboard\" 200. Caryn Ganz from \"Rolling Stone\" complimented it as an \"impressive taste of her upcoming tour\", while BBC correspondent Mark Savage panned it as \"an attempt to harness the urban market\".\n\"4 Minutes\" was released as the album's lead single and peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It was Madonna's 37th top-ten hit on the chart and pushed her past Elvis Presley as the artist with the most top-ten hits. In the UK she retained her record for the most number-one singles for a female artist; \"4 Minutes\" becoming her thirteenth. At the 23rd Japan Gold Disc Awards, Madonna received her fifth Artist of the Year trophy from Recording Industry Association of Japan, the most for any artist. To further promote the album, she embarked on the Sticky & Sweet Tour, her first major venture with Live Nation. With a total gross of $408 million, it ended up as the second highest-grossing tour of all time, behind The Rolling Stones's A Bigger Bang Tour. It remained the highest-grossing tour by a solo artist until Roger Waters' The Wall Live surpassed it in 2013.\n\n\"Life with My Sister Madonna\", a book released in July 2008 by Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted at number two on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list. The book caused a rift between Madonna and Christopher, because of unsolicited publication. By fall, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. In December 2008, Madonna's spokesperson announced that Madonna had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which granted him between £50–60 million ($– million), a figure that included the couple's London pub and residence and Wiltshire estate in England. The marriage was dissolved by District Judge Reid by \"decree nisi\" at the clinical Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. They entered a compromise agreement for Rocco and David, then aged eight and three respectively, and divided the children's time between Ritchie's London home and Madonna's in New York, where the two were joined by Lourdes. Soon after, Madonna applied to adopt Chifundo \"Mercy\" James from Malawi in May 2009, but the country's High Court rejected the application because Madonna was not a resident there. She re-appealed, and on June 12, 2009, the Supreme Court of Malawi granted her the right to adopt Mercy.\n\nMadonna concluded her contract with Warner by releasing her third greatest-hits album, \"Celebration\", in September 2009. It contained the new songs \"Celebration\" and \"Revolver\" along with 34 hits spanning her musical career with the label. \"Celebration\" reached number one in several countries, including Canada, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. She appeared at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards to speak in tribute to deceased pop singer Michael Jackson. Madonna ended the 2000s as the best-selling single artist of the decade in the U.S. and the most-played artist of the decade in the UK. \"Billboard\" also announced her as the third top-touring artist of the decade—behind only The Rolling Stones and U2—with a gross of over $801 million, 6.3 million attendance and 244 sell-outs of 248 shows.\n\nMadonna performed at the concert in January 2010. Her third live album, \"Sticky & Sweet Tour\", was released in April, debuting at number ten on the \"Billboard\" 200. It also became her 20th top-ten on the Oricon Albums Chart, breaking the Beatles' record for the most top-ten album by an international act in Japan. Madonna granted American television show, \"Glee\", the rights to her entire catalog of music, and the producers created an episode featuring her songs exclusively. She also collaborated with Lourdes and released the Material Girl clothing line, inspired by her punk-girl style when she rose to fame in the 1980s. In October, she opened a series of fitness centers around the world named Hard Candy Fitness, and three months later unveiled a second fashion brand called Truth or Dare which included footwear, perfumes, underclothing, and accessories.\n\nMadonna directed her second feature film, \"W.E.\", a biographical account about the affair between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. Co-written with Alek Keshishian, the film was premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in September 2011. Critical and commercial response to the film was negative. Madonna contributed the ballad \"Masterpiece\" for the film's soundtrack, which won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.\n\nIn February 2012, Madonna headlined the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. Her performance was visualized by Cirque Du Soleil and Jamie King and featured special guests LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A. and Cee Lo Green. It became the then most-watched Super Bowl halftime show in history with 114 million viewers, higher than the game itself. During the event, she performed \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", the lead single from her twelfth studio album, \"MDNA\". It became her record-extending 38th top-ten single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\"MDNA\" was released in March 2012 and saw collaboration with various producers, including William Orbit and Martin Solveig. It was her first release under her three-album deal with Interscope Records, which she signed as a part of her 360 deal with Live Nation. She was signed to the record label since Live Nation was unable to distribute music recordings. \"MDNA\" became Madonna's fifth consecutive studio record to debut at the top of the \"Billboard\" 200. The album was mostly promoted by The MDNA Tour, which lasted from May to December 2012. The tour featured controversial subjects such as violence, firearms, human rights, nudity and politics. With a gross of $305.2 million from 88 sold-out shows, it became the highest-grossing tour of 2012 and then-tenth highest-grossing tour of all time. Madonna was named the top-earning celebrity of the year by \"Forbes,\" earning an estimated $125 million.\n\nMadonna collaborated with Steven Klein and directed a 17-minute film, \"secretprojectrevolution\", which was released on BitTorrent in September 2013. With the film she launched the Art for Freedom initiative, which helped to promote \"art and free speech as a means to address persecution and injustice across the globe\". The website for the project included over 3,000 art related submissions since its inception, with Madonna regularly monitoring and enlisting other artists like David Blaine and Katy Perry as guest curators.\n\nBy 2013, Madonna's Raising Malawi had built ten schools to educate 4,000 children in Malawi at a value of $400,000. When Madonna visited the schools in April 2013, President of Malawi Joyce Banda accused her of exaggerating the charity's contribution. Madonna was saddened by Banda's statement, but clarified that she had \"no intention of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations\". It was later confirmed that Banda had not approved the statement released by her press team. Madonna also visited her hometown Detroit during May 2014 and donated funds to help with the city's bankruptcy. The same year, her business ventures extended to skin care products with the launch of MDNA Skin in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nMadonna's thirteenth studio album, \"Rebel Heart\", was released in March 2015, three months after its thirteen demos leaked onto the Internet. Unlike her previous efforts, which involved only a few people, Madonna worked with a large number of collaborators, including Avicii, Diplo and Kanye West. Introspection was listed as one of the foundational themes prevalent on the record, along with \"genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection\". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for \"Rebel Heart\". Music critics responded positively towards the album, calling it her best effort in a decade. \"Rebel Heart\" became Madonna's first album to miss the top position of the \"Billboard\" 200 since \"Ray of Light\", but reached number one in other major music markets, including Australia, Canada, Germany and Italy.\nFrom September 2015 to March 2016, Madonna embarked on the Rebel Heart Tour to promote the album. The tour traveled throughout North America, Europe and Asia and was Madonna's first visit to Australia in 23 years, where she also performed a for her fans. Rebel Heart Tour grossed a total of $169.8 million from the 82 shows, with over 1.045 million ticket sales. While on tour, Madonna became engaged in a legal battle with Ritchie, over the custody of their son Rocco. The dispute started when Rocco decided to continue living in England with Ritchie when the tour had visited there, while Madonna wanted him to travel with her. Court hearings took place in both New York and London. After multiple deliberations, Madonna withdrew her application for custody and decided to resolve the matter privately.\n\nIn October 2016, \"Billboard\" named Madonna its Woman of the Year. Her \"blunt and brutally honest\" speech about ageism and sexism at the ceremony received widespread coverage in the media. The next month Madonna, who actively supported Hillary Clinton during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, performed an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park in support of Clinton's campaign. Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. She sparked controversy when she said that she \"thought a lot about blowing up the White House\". The following day, Madonna asserted she was \"not a violent person\" and that her words had been \"taken wildly out of context\".\n\nIn February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella, and she moved to live in Lisbon, Portugal in summer 2017 with her adoptive children. In July she opened the Mercy James Institute for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care in Malawi, a children's hospital built by her Raising Malawi charity. The live album chronicling the Rebel Heart Tour was released in September 2017, and won Best Music Video for Western Artists at the 32nd Japan Gold Disc Award. That month, Madonna launched MDNA Skin in select stores in the United States, after getting \"tired of hearing people complain here that they can't get it in America\". A few months earlier, the auction house Gotta Have Rock and Roll had put up Madonna's personal items like love letters from Tupac Shakur, cassettes, underwear and a hairbrush for sale. Darlene Lutz, an art dealer who had initiated the auction, was sued by Madonna's representatives to stop the proceedings. Madonna clarified that her celebrity status \"does not obviate my right to maintain my privacy, including with regard to highly personal items\". Madonna lost the case and the presiding judge ruled in favor of Lutz who was able to prove that in 2004 Madonna made a legal agreement with her for selling the items.\n\nIn January 2018, Madonna announced on Instagram that she had started working on her 14th studio album. She later clarified the album would be infused with Portuguese fado music, with its release scheduled in 2019. Four months later, she appeared at the 2018 Met Gala and performed a new song called \"Beautiful Game\", along with \"Like a Prayer\" and Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\". At the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, Madonna paid tribute to singer Aretha Franklin, who had died the previous week. In October 2018 she contributed guest vocals on the track \"Champagne Rosé\" on American rapper Quavo's debut album, \"Quavo Huncho\". Her other projects include directing the MGM film, \"Taking Flight\", based on ballet dancer Michaela DePrince's memoir, as well as adapting author Andrew Sean Greer's novel, \"The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells\", for film.\n\nMadonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of \"Contemporary Strategy Analysis\" (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is \"certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest.\" He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career. The author believed that Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of \"Find a winning formula and stick to it\". Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that \"having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing.\" Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that \"Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition.\" According to Thomas Harrison in the book \"Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties\", Madonna was \"an artist who pushed the boundaries\" of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically.\n\nThroughout her career Madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, one of her past collaborators, said that \"You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it.\" Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important \"self-revelation\". Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including \"Lucky Star\" which she composed on synthesizer. As a songwriter, she has registered a total of 287 songs to ASCAP, including 18 songs written entirely by herself. \"Rolling Stone\" has named her \"an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.\" According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing \"incredible\" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. Despite having worked with producers across many genres, \"Rolling Stone\" writes that Madonna's songs have been \"consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail.\" She has criticized \"songwriting camps\" which she had to undergo during album cycles for \"Rebel Heart\" and \"MDNA\", due to the fact that people are always in a hurry. She clarified her preference for writing material with other artists \"from beginning to the end\" of a record, and described her songs as \"meant to be ironic and not taken literally, and some are just straight-up, 'Open my veins, this is who I am'.\" Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Madonna at number 56 on the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\" list.\nBefore emerging as a pop star, Madonna spent her early years dabbling in rock music alongside her bands, Breakfast Club and Emmy. While performing with Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12–14 songs which resemble the punk rock of that period. Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album \"Pre-Madonna\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that with her self-titled debut album, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished arrangements and Madonna's own vocal style. Her second album, \"Like a Virgin\" (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works (pizzicato synthesizer line that opens \"Angel\"); potential negative reaction from social groups (\"Dress You Up\" was blacklisted by the Parents Music Resource Center); and retro styles (\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\", Madonna's homage to Motown).\n\nHer mature artistic statement was visible in \"True Blue\" (1986) and \"Like a Prayer\" (1989). In \"True Blue\", she incorporated classical music in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music. \"Like a Prayer\" introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, funk, R&B and gospel music. Her versatility was further shown on \"I'm Breathless\", which consists predominantly of the 1930s Broadway showtune-flavored jazz, swing and big band tracks. Madonna continued to compose ballads and uptempo dance songs for \"Erotica\" (1992) and \"Bedtime Stories\" (1994). Both albums explored element of new jack swing, with Jim Farber from \"Entertainment Weekly\" saying that \"she could actually be viewed as new jack swing's godmother.\" She tried to remain contemporary by incorporating samples, drum loops and hip hop into her music. With \"Ray of Light\", Madonna brought electronic music from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene.\n\nMadonna experimented with more folk and acoustic music in \"Music\" (2000) and \"American Life\" (2003). A change was noted in the content of the songs in \"Music\", with most of them being simple love songs, but with an underlying tone of melancholy. According to \"Q\" magazine, \"American Life\" was characterized by \"a thumping techno rhythm, liquid keyboard lines, an acoustic chorus and a bizarre Madonna rap.\" The \"conventional rock songs\" of the album were suffused with dramatic lyrics about patriotism and composition, including the appearance of a gospel choir in the song \"Nothing Fails\". Madonna returned to pure dance songs with \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\", infusing club beats and retro music with paradoxical and metaphorical lyrics. She moved to an urban direction musically with \"Hard Candy\" (2008), mixing R&B and hip hop with dance tunes. \"MDNA\" (2012) largely focused in electronic dance music, which she has embraced since \"Ray of Light\".\n\nPossessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range, Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of \"Madonna: Blonde Ambition\", called her \"the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs\", despite not being a \"heavyweight talent.\" According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, \"Madonna's vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs \"straight,\" but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.\" Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as \"Minnie Mouse on helium\". During the filming of \"Evita\", Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, \"I studied with a vocal coach for \"Evita\" and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it.\"\n\nBesides singing, Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. She learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy in the late 1970s, before joining the Breakfast Club line-up as the drummer. This helped her to form the band Emmy, where she performed as the guitarist and lead vocalist. Madonna later played guitar on her demo recordings. On the liner notes of \"Pre-Madonna\", Stephen Bray wrote: \"I've always thought she passed up a brilliant career as a rhythm guitarist.\" After her career breakthrough, Madonna focused mainly in singing but was also credited for playing cowbell on \"Madonna\" (1983) and synthesizer on \"Like a Prayer\" (1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film \"Music of the Heart\", before eventually leaving the project. After two decades, Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of \"Music\" (2000). She took further lessons from guitarist Monte Pittman to improve her guitar skill. Since then, Madonna has played guitar on every tour, as well as her studio albums. At the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards, she received nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award, which honors the most promising up-and-coming guitarist.\n\nAccording to Taraborrelli, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother. Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming. Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important than the death of her mother: \"It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.\"\n\nAs they grew older Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite poet. Later, Madonna commented: \"The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself.\" Taraborrelli believed that the devastation and abandonment Madonna felt at the loss of her mother taught her \"a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own.\"\nIn 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" by Nancy Sinatra; she said it summed up her own \"take-charge attitude\". As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was baroque, and loved Mozart and Chopin because she liked their \"feminine quality\". Madonna's major influences include Debbie Harry, Chrissie Hynde, Karen Carpenter, The Supremes and Led Zeppelin, as well as dancers Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev. She also grew up listening to David Bowie, whose show was the first rock concert she ever attended.\n\nMadonna's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents are reflected in the album \"Like a Prayer\". It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career. Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata. During The Virgin Tour, she wore a rosary and prayed with it in the music video for \"La Isla Bonita\". The \"Open Your Heart\" video sees her boss scolding her in the Italian language. On the Who's That Girl World Tour, she dedicated the song \"Papa Don't Preach\" to Pope John Paul II. Her album \"MDNA\" (2012) has also drawn many influences from her Catholic upbringing, and since 2011 she has been attending meetings and services at an Opus Dei center, a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through every day life.\n\nDuring her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, \"I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny ... and I saw myself in them ... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence.\" Her \"Material Girl\" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\", from the film \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" (1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film \"Who's That Girl\". The video for \"Express Yourself\" (1989) was inspired by Fritz Lang's silent film \"Metropolis\" (1927). The video for \"Vogue\" recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including Bette Davis, described by Madonna as an idol. However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by film critics. Stephanie Zacharek stated in \"Time\" that, \"[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest.\" According to biographer Andrew Morton, \"Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt.\" After the box office bomb \"Swept Away\" (2002), Madonna vowed that she would never again act in a film, hoping her repertoire as a bad actress would never be discussed again. In 2016, a career retrospective, titled \"Body of Work\", was shown at New York's Metrograph hall. According to \"The Guardian\"s Nigel M. Smith, Madonna's film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her, and given a chance \"[she] could steal a scene for all the right reasons\".\n\nInfluences also came to her from the art world, such as through the works of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. The music video of the song \"Bedtime Story\" featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and Remedios Varo. Madonna is also a collector of Tamara de Lempicka's Art Deco paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours. Her video for \"Hollywood\" (2003) was an homage to the work of photographer Guy Bourdin; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorised use of his father's work. Pop artist Andy Warhol's use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for \"Erotica\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\".\n\nMadonna is dedicated to Kabbalah, and in 2004 she adopted the name Esther which in Persian means \"star\". She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject. She faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity dilettantism. Madonna defended her studies, saying: \"It would be less controversial if I joined the Nazi Party\", and that her involvement with the Kabbalah is \"not hurting anybody\". The influence of the Kabbalah was subsequently observed in Madonna's music, especially albums like \"Ray of Light\" and \"Music\". During the Re-Invention World Tour, at one point in the show, Madonna and her dancers wore T-shirts that read \"Kabbalists Do It Better\".\n\nIn \"The Madonna Companion\" biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work. According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book \"Nots\" (1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is video and the reigning \"queen of video\" is Madonna. He further asserted that \"the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory.\" The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", or \"Justify My Love\" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves. Morton felt that \"artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos.\"\n\nMadonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor. She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience. The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the \"True Blue\" era. Author Douglas Kellner noted, \"such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences.\" Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of \"La Isla Bonita\".\nAcademics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex. This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for \"Like a Prayer\". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the Vatican and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal. In 2003, MTV named her \"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\" and said that \"Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.\"\n\nMadonna's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV; Chris Nelson from \"The New York Times\" spoke of pop artists like Madonna saying, \"MTV, with its almost exclusively lip-synched videos, ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words.\" The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. He added, \"Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing.\" Thor Christensen of \"The Dallas Morning News\" commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by \"stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe ... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time.\"\n\nTo allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the \"Madonna mic\". Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes. Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. She believed that \"her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized\".\n\nTaraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are \"extravagant show piece[s], [and] walking art show[s].\" Madonna always films her concert tours, saying: \"It's like documenting and archiving your artwork. It's a record of something I created with a lot of great and talented people... They're stages of my career, and they tell a story. They're an important part of my legacy, so I'm documenting them,\" she explained. Madonna has expressed her desire to create a stripped-down, acoustic only concert \"that continues to involve music and dance [but also] poetry and humor\". She also wanted to involve water elements in her productions but had been discouraged due to logistical problems.\n\nVarious music journalists, critical theorists, and authors have noted Madonna's legacy and deemed her the most influential female recording artist of all time. She topped VH1's \"100 Greatest Women in Music\" list and \"The Daily Telegraph\"s \"20 Greatest Female Artists\" list. Author Carol Clerk wrote that \"during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon.\" \"Rolling Stone\" of Spain wrote that \"She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since the Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep on the edge of tendency and commerciality.\" Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti in the book \"Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop\" (2012) wrote that \"really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look \"du jour\", and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye.\" William Langley from \"The Daily Telegraph\" felt that \"Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to.\" Alan McGee from \"The Guardian\" felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again. He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop.\nAccording to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC, \"It's worth noting that before Madonna, most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after her, almost all would be female singers ... When the Beatles hit America, they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it back—with an emphasis on the female.\" Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, asserted that \"Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow ... She certainly raised the standards of all of them ... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers.\" According to Fouz-Hernández, subsequent female singers such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, the Spice Girls, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, and Pink were like her \"daughters in the very direct sense that they grew up listening to and admiring Madonna, and decided they wanted to be like her.\" Madonna has also influenced male artists, inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musicians.\n\nMadonna's use of sexual imagery has benefited her career and catalyzed public discourse on sexuality and feminism. As Roger Chapman documents in \"Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices, Volume 1\" (2010), she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations, social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit, sexual imagery and lyrics, religious symbolism, and otherwise \"irreverent\" behavior in her live performances. \"The Times\" wrote that she had \"started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.\" Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one's social relations. In \"Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture\" (2009), the authors noted that Madonna, as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, Madonna represents woman's occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women. Professor Sut Jhally has referred to Madonna as \"an almost sacred feminist icon.\"\n\nMadonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen in her industry, \"achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry\", and generating over $1.2 billion in sales within the first decade of her career. According to Gini Gorlinski in the book \"The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time\" (2010), Madonna's levels of power and control were \"unprecedented\" for a woman in the entertainment industry. Professor Colin Barrow from Cranfield School of Management described her as \"America's smartest businesswoman ... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself.\" London Business School academics called her a \"dynamic entrepreneur\" worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that \"Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her.\"\n\nMadonna is the wealthiest woman in the music business, with an estimated net worth between $590 million to $800 million. She has sold more than 300 million records worldwide. The \"Guinness World Records\" acknowledged her as the best-selling female recording artist and the fourth best-selling act of all time, behind the Beatles, Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second top-selling female albums artist in the United States, with 64.5 million certified albums. Madonna is the most certified artist of all time in United Kingdom, with 45 awards from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) as of April 2013.\n\nMadonna remains the highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time, with over $1.4 billion earned from her concert tours throughout her career. As of 2016, \"Billboard\" Boxscore ranked Madonna as the third highest-grossing touring act of all time, with over $1.31 billion in concert gross since 1990, behind only The Rolling Stones ($1.84 billion) and U2 ($1.67 billion). Madonna also remains the only woman in history with two solo concerts attended by 100,000 people; her Who's That Girl World Tour's concert in Parc de Sceaux, Paris, drew over 130,000 audience, while her Girlie Show World Tour's concert in Maracanã Stadium, Rio de Janeiro, drew over 120,000 audience. Madonna has also won seven Grammy Awards and twenty MTV Video Music Awards, including the 1986 Video Vanguard Award for which she became the first female recipient.\n\nMadonna holds the record for the most number-ones on all combined \"Billboard\" charts, including twelve number-one songs on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and eight number-one albums on the \"Billboard\" 200. With 46 songs topping the Dance Club Songs chart, Madonna became the artist with the most number-one songs on an active \"Billboard\" chart, pulling ahead of George Strait with 44 number-one songs on the Hot Country Songs chart. She has also scored 38 top-ten singles on the Hot 100, more than any other artist in history. In 2008, \"Billboard\" ranked her at number two, behind the Beatles, on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the chart's history. In 2016, the magazine listed her as the Greatest Dance Club Songs Artist of All Time. At the 40th anniversary of Germany's GfK Media Control Charts, Madonna was listed as the most successful singles artist in the chart's history.\n\n\nFilms starred\nFilms directed\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "46407530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46407530", "title": "Muggiaea atlantica", "text": "Muggiaea atlantica\n\nMuggiaea atlantica is a species of small hydrozoan, a siphonophore in the family Diphyidae. It is a cosmopolitan species occurring in inshore waters of many of the world's oceans, and it has colonised new areas such as the North Sea and the Adriatic Sea. It is subject to large population swings, and has been held responsible for the death of farmed salmon in Norway. The species was first described by J.T. Cunningham in 1892 from a specimen obtained at Plymouth, England.\n\n\"Muggiaea atlantica\" is a small colonial siphonophore, but one of the two nectophores (swimming bells) is undeveloped. The remaining nectophore grows to a length of about . It is translucent and has five straight, longitudinal ridges, some of which may form a keel. The hydroecium (ventral cavity) is about one third of the length of the nectophore, and the long slender somatocyst (extension of the gastrovascular system) reaches the apex of the nectosac (central cavity) and sometimes contains oil droplets. The eudoxid (reproductive stage) soon becomes detached. It has a cone-shaped, asymmetric bract with a wide flanged suture running from apex to base. The right edge of the bract is curved while the left edge is truncated horizontally. The lower surface has a small cavity in which the somatocyst is situated.\n\n\"Muggiaea atlantica\" is a neritic species that forms part of the zooplankton, and is found in the upper hundred metres of inshore temperate and subtropical waters worldwide. It is present in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. It is a common siphonophore and probably more abundant than any other species of siphonophore in nearshore habitats. Its abundance is seasonal, and in parts of the northern hemisphere it has population peaks in May/June and again in September/November. In the western English Channel it occurred sporadically before the 1960s but after 1968 it became resident. Its seasonal distribution and abundance seem to be associated with sea temperature changes and the availability of food. It appeared in the southern Adriatic Sea for the first time in the mid 1990s and became increasingly common there. It was detected in the marine lakes on the island of Mljet in southern Croatia in 2001, and seems to have displaced \"Muggiaea kochii\" in the Great Lake there. It is hypothesized that the cold winter of 2000/2001 favoured the more cold-tolerant \"M. atlantica\" over the warm-temperate \"M. kochii\".\n\n\"Muggiaea atlantica\" swims in an arc, propelled by pulsations of its bell, and then remains stationary for several minutes. It feeds almost entirely on copepods, consuming an estimated five to ten prey items daily, mostly during the night. In the eastern Pacific it is eaten by predatory fish such as the blue rockfish (\"Sebastes mystinus\"), and by the floating sea snail \"Carinaria cristata\".\n\nReproduction in this species is by an alternation of generations between an asexual polygastric animal (bearing both asexual and reproductive elements) and the sexual eudoxid stage which becomes detached from the nectophore. The generation time is short and under favourable conditions, numbers can build up rapidly.\n\nA population explosion of \"M. atlantica\" in the North Sea in 1989 caused major changes in the composition of the community. The siphonophere was present at densities of five hundred per cubic metre and this depleted the copepods normally present. This resulted in a reduction in the grazing pressure on the phytoplankton and an increase in their growth, causing an algal bloom and other cascading ecosystem effects.\n\nThe aquaculture industry in Norway suffered a setback in 2007 when more than 100,000 caged salmon were killed by a bloom of \"M. atlantica\", present at a concentration of 2,000 per cubic metre in coastal waters. This siphonophore is also thought to have been involved in the loss of a million farmed salmon in Ireland in 2003.\n"}

Thus, the Cameroon became the field of work for the Canadian Spiritans until 1947 when their mission activity was shifted to Nigeria; in Nigeria they teamed up with their confreres from England under the authority of Father Francis Murray, the Administrator of the Prefecture of Benue until the arrival of Msgr. James Hagan as Prefect Apostolic.\n\nIn March 1955 the Prefecture of Kabba was created from Benin City Diocese and the Prefecture of Otukpo by the Vatican decree Number 1017 dated March 01, 1955; and Msgr Auguste Delisle, CSSp, a missionary since 1935 and on the Nigerian team since 1952 became the Prefect Apostolic by the Vatican decree number 2579 dated May 27, 1955. The new Prefecture was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Onitsha. In terms of political pision Kabba Prefecture was coterminous with Kabba Province.\n\nIt was not until 1964 that the Prefecture of Kabba was raise to status of a Diocese by a Vatican decree dated July 06, 1964 with Msgr. A. Delisle as its first bishop; the name of the new diocese was Kabba and it remained a suffragan of Onitsha Archdiocese until ten weeks later when by a Vatican decree dated September 14, 1964 the Diocese of Kabba was made a suffragan of Kaduna. And by ye another Vatican decree number 1734 dated May 05, 1965 the Diocese of Kabba changed name to Diocese of Lokoja. According to Bishop Makozi,\n\nThe Prefecture of Kabba changed name briefly to Diocese of Kabba. To facilitate the administration of the diocese, the name was changed, of course with the approval of Rome, to Diocese of Lokoja, since the Kabba Provincial Headquarters was Lokoja where the Provincial Resident and his political administration resided.\n\nA major pastoral progress was made when Idah Prefecture was created out of Lokoja Diocese with Msgr. Leopold Grimard as the Prefect Apostolic; the Prefecture was raised to the status of a diocese in 1978 with Bishop Ephraim S. Obot as its first bishop.\n\nIn 1971 the slow but sure process of indigenization of Kabba ecclesiastical jurisdiction that started with the priestly ordination of the duo of Alexius O. Makozi and Joseph Ohieku, assumed a far-reaching development when on May 30,1971 was raised to the episcopate as auxiliary bishop of Lokoja; Bishop Makozi became the bishop of Lokoja in 1972. Thus Bishop A. Delisle was the local ordinary of Kabba\\Lokoja ecclesiastical jurisdiction for about seventeen years (1955 – 1972).\n\nBishop A.O. Makozi administered the diocese of Lokoja as the local ordinary until 1992 when he was transferred to the diocese of Port Harcourt. Bishop Joseph Sunday Ajomo replaced Bishop Makozi on May 03, 1992 as the bishop of Lokoja until he joined the Church Triumphant on June 20, 2004. May he rest in peace.\n\nFollowing the sudden death of Bishop Joseph Sunday Ajomo, Late Very Rev. Fr. Joseph Ohieku was appointed the Diocesan Administrator in accordance with the relevant canonical provisions. He was automatically relieved when the Bishop elect, Msgr. Martin Dada Abejide Olorunmolu (appointed November 11, 2005), was ordained and installed February 11, 2006 as the fourth bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Lokoja.

{"id": "11060291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11060291", "title": "The Day the Leader was Killed", "text": "The Day the Leader was Killed\n\nThe Day the Leader was Killed (orig. Arabic يوم مقتل الزعيم) is a novel written and published by Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz in 1983.\n\nThe novel follows multiple narratives written in the stream of consciousness format. The novel is set during the early 1980s whilst Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was introducing the infitah or \"open door\" free-market economic policies which led to widespread unrest. The plot revolves around a young Egyptian man who is in love with a co-worker, but her father will not permit their marriage because the young man cannot earn enough money to purchase and furnish an apartment. Told from the perspective of Elwan, Randa and Elwan's grandfather Muhtashimi. Trapped in low-paid jobs amidst years of inflation and uneven distribution of wealth, Elwan and Randa's engagement has persisted for years without Elwan found the means to fulfil the financial obligations for marriage. Elwan refuses to accede to corruption or outside work to improve these circumstances, and both characters are noble and proud but perceived by others to be impractical and stagnant. Randa is pressured by her family and her government superior - Anwar - to break off the engagement as her advancing years means she will soon find herself too old to be desirable to potential suitors. Anwar simultaneously pressures Elwan to reconsider his circumstances and introduces him to his widowed sister, Gulstan, who is wealthy and looking for a new husband. Elwan finds himself attracted to Gulstan and feels sexual desire he has had to long suppress on account of his attenuated engagement to Randa. Muhtashimi is disappointed that his beloved grandson finds himself in his situation, and his narrative questions the direction of the country which as a younger man he had ardently fought to create as an activist teacher in the nationalist movement. Punctuated throughout the novel are comments on the decline of Sadat's Egypt and the increasing national despair amidst a revolution that has gradually lost its way.\n\nMatters come to a head when Randa's mother visits Elwan's family and lays plain the problems of the engagement. Elwan's family is sympathetic as Elwan, as a man, may marry easily at any age. Elwan, unable to bear the social pressure and the lack of support for continued engagement from his family or colleagues, releases Randa from her obligations to him, despite great personal angst at betraying his love for her. Randa is in disbelief and then furious at Elwan, breaking off most contact between them and quickly dismissing her deep-seated love for Elwan, whilst Elwan remains tortured and despairing of the turn of events. She soon pursues a relationship with Anwar and then marries him, seeing it as a practical and viable alternative after years of torpor with Elwan. However she is soon disenchanted when she realizes despite Anwar's long overtures, the marriage is not one of true emotional connection and Anwar merely desires Randa as means to befit his social position and serve domestic functions. Randa, caught between modern ideals and traditional obligations, struggles with the new role and then quickly rejects it, seeking a quick divorce, which throws her and Anwar into social disrepute. Elwan meanwhile pursues a relationship of sorts Gulstan and considers marrying her, but his pride refuses the notion of him being 'sold' and he feels any match with Gulstan will be socially embarrassing and speak to weakness. Randa and Elwan reacquaint after Randa's divorce and Randa confesses the lie of the marriage to Anwar, which angers Elwan but does not lead to their reconciliation.\n\nAt the crescendo of the story, President Sadat is assassinated, much to the horror of the characters in the story. Provoked by the events while despairing of his country and himself, Elwan goes to meet with Gulstan but finds Anwar there. In uncharacteristic rage, Elwan unleashes on Anwar kills him. The horrified Gulstan attempts to help Elwan cover up the murder on account of Anwar's pre-existing heart condition and her feelings for Elwan, but Elwan is resigned to fate and only half-heartedly attempts to conceal his crime. Elwan is imprisoned, bringing the story of Egypt's path and Elwan's into alignment. The novel ends with Muhtashimi's regret over the twin courses of disappointment, and regards Egypt as a nation caught between its many problems and a national character with occasional victories but far many disappointments and failings. Muhtashimi however recalls over the course of the novel his great faith in the teachings of the prophet and Islam, and ultimately believes as he prepares to die that faith will see his family, his grandson and his country through these yet again difficult times.\n\nLike many of Mahfouz's novels, the book uses Egyptian history and society to analyze universal themes such as the relationship between love and economics, familiar relationships, death, and the irrationality of human emotion.\n"}
