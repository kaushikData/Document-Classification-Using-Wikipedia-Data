It was partly excavated by the American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas. Achilleion is a large site that is practically untouched by archaeologists which Gimbutas claims to be filled entirely with Neolithic debris and hundreds of Neolithic mounds. An excavation was planned because the dig was expected to have a high yield of artifacts and if successful would possibly provide proof of an earlier age of European Neolithic settlement then was previously known. Excavation was started because it was expected that they would find significant numbers of preceramic Neolithic remains. The work started by Marija Gimbutas was stopped because the dig failed to yield any significant findings, but Gimbutas claims that the dig was interrupted by the political unrest caused by the Cyprus conflict. \n\nLocation: Achilleion is located in modern-day Greece, in an area now known as Thessaly. Thessaly lies in northern Greece, just south of Macedonia. Thessaly is best known as a popular vacation spot with beautiful scenery, but it was also believed to be filled with artifacts that could give scientists important clues to past civilizations.\n\nThe Excavation: The excavation was funded by UCLA in 1973 and 1974 during the months of August and September. The dig was also supported by the National Science Foundation and the Samuel H. Kress foundation. The dig team consisted of Marija Gimbutas leading the excavation along with 40 other students and scholars.\n\nThe Findings: While the excavation was still in progress, there were four test pits dug each about 5 meters deep. Some useful things were recovered from the site; samples of preserved fauna, pottery, and 3 houses were discovered. Unfortunately, Gimbutas overlooked important details when reporting on her excavation, “No geologic, geomorphologic, sedimentologic, or pedologic study was carried out- a serious failing” (McPherron).\n\n"}

{"id": "365705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365705", "title": "Bob Edwards", "text": "Bob Edwards\n\nRobert Alan \"Bob\" Edwards (born May 16, 1947) is an American broadcast journalist, a Peabody Award-winning member of the National Radio Hall of Fame. He gained reputation as the first host of National Public Radio's flagship program, \"Morning Edition\". Starting in 2004, Edwards then was the host of \"The Bob Edwards Show\" on Sirius XM Radio and \"Bob Edwards Weekend\" distributed by Public Radio International to more than 150 public radio stations. Those programs ended in September 2015.\n\nEdwards is a graduate of St. Xavier High School (Louisville) and the University of Louisville and began his radio career in 1968 at a small radio station in New Albany, Indiana, a town located across the Ohio River from Louisville. Afterwards, Edwards served in the U.S. Army, producing and anchoring TV and radio news programs for the American Forces Korea Network from Seoul. Following his army service, he went on to anchor news for WTOP/1500, a CBS affiliate, in Washington, D.C. He also earned an M.A. in communication from American University in Washington D.C. In 1972, at age 25, Edwards anchored national newscasts for the Mutual Broadcasting System. Edwards joined NPR in 1974. Before hosting \"Morning Edition\", Edwards was co-host of \"All Things Considered\". Edwards is married to NPR news anchor Windsor Johnston. He has two daughters, Eleanor and Susannah, and a stepson, Brean Campbell.\n\nEdwards hosted NPR's flagship program, \"Morning Edition\", from the show's inception in 1979 until 2004. After 24-plus years with Edwards as host, Arbitron ratings showed that, with 13 million listeners, it was the second highest-rated radio broadcast in the country, behind only Rush Limbaugh's AM show. Prior to his departure, he was very popular among both listeners and critics.\n\nWhen \"Morning Edition\" and its host won a George Foster Peabody Award in 1999, the Peabody committee lauded Edwards as \nEdwards' skills as an interviewer have been widely praised. NPR's ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin said, \"If I were his producer, I would think of Edwards as NPR's version of Charlie Rose.\" The \"New York Daily News\" called him \"an institution among \"Morning Edition\" listeners for his interviewing skills and his calm, articulate style.\" It is estimated that Edwards conducted over 20,000 interviews for NPR. His subjects ranged from major politicians to authors and celebrities. His weekly call-in chats with retired sportscaster Red Barber are fondly remembered. The chats were supposedly about sports, but often digressed into topics like the Gulf War, what kind of flowers were blooming at Barber's Tallahassee, Florida home, or other non-sport subjects. Barber would call Edwards \"Colonel Bob,\" referring to Edwards' Kentucky Colonel honor from his native state. Barber died in 1992, and the following year Edwards based his first book, \"Fridays with Red: A Radio Friendship\" (), on the weekly interviews.\n\nIn 2003, Edwards was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame.\n\nIn April 2004, NPR executives decided to \"freshen up\" \"Morning Edition\"'s sound. Edwards was removed as host, replaced with Steve Inskeep and Renée Montagne, and reassigned as a senior correspondent for NPR News. The move took him by surprise. \"I'd rather stay,\" he said, \"but it's not my decision to make.\" At first, NPR executives and spokespersons did not fully explain the move, leaving many listeners confused. Eventually they did make some attempts to explain themselves. According to NPR spokeswoman Laura Gross, \"It's part of a natural evolution. A new host will bring new ideas and perspectives to the show. Bob's voice will still be heard; he'll still be a tremendous influence on the show. We just felt it was time for a change.\" Executive Vice President Ken Stern also explained the move. \"This change in \"Morning Edition\" is part of the ongoing evaluation of all NPR programming that has taken place over the last several years. We've looked at shows like \"All Things Considered\" and \"Talk of the Nation\" with an eye to how we can best serve listeners in the future.\" Although Stern later participated in an online chat with listeners at NPR's website, it only heightened their confusion and anger.\n\nThe decision to remove Edwards, made shortly before his 25th anniversary with the show, was met with much criticism by listeners. Jeffrey Dvorkin, NPR's ombudsman, reported that the network received over 50,000 letters and emails, most of them angry, regarding Edwards' demotion; the listener reaction was the largest reaction on a single subject that NPR had received to that date. Other journalists, including ABC's Cokie Roberts and CBS' Charles Osgood, expressed dissatisfaction with the move.\n\nHis final broadcast as host was on April 30, 2004; his last \"Morning Edition\" interview was with Charles Osgood, who had also been Edwards' first Morning Edition interview subject almost 25 years earlier. Coincidentally, the last show also included a segment about the last Oldsmobile, which rolled off an assembly line the day before.\n\nDuring his final months at NPR, Edwards wrote his second book, \"Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism\" (), published in May 2004. The book, a short biography of Edward R. Murrow, brought some public attention to history's most noted broadcast journalist prior to the release of the 2004 film \"Good Night and Good Luck\". NPR removed Edwards from \"Morning Edition\" that spring rather than waiting for his 25th anniversary with the show in the fall, using the book tour to make a \"clean break\" rather than bringing him back for a final three-month stint.\n\nEdwards decided not to remain at NPR as a senior correspondent and filed only one story, an interview with Bob Dole and other Senate veterans of World War II about the Washington, DC, World War II memorial, in that role. Three months after his departure from \"Morning Edition\", XM Satellite Radio announced that he had signed on to host a new program, \"The Bob Edwards Show\", for its new XM Public Radio channel.\n\nHis memoir, \"A Voice in the Box\", was published in September 2011.\n\n\"They want to give me a program, so I can continue to host and be heard every day instead of occasionally, as I would have been at NPR,\" Edwards told \"The Washington Post\". He said the format would be \"loose\": \"It'll be long interviews, short interviews, and then maybe departments... You've got to have the news... it's not going to be all features, yet it's not going to be the \"Financial Times\", either.\" \"The Bob Edwards Show\"'s first broadcast was on October 4, 2004. \"Washington Post\" columnist David Broder and former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite were Edwards' first guests.\n\nWhile continuing his daily show on XM, Edwards returned to public radio stations in January 2006 with his show \"Bob Edwards Weekend\", produced by XM Satellite Radio and distributed by Public Radio International to affiliate stations around the country. A September 22, 2005 press release from PRI states, \"\"Bob Edwards Weekend\" will provide PRI listeners with an opportunity to sample some of the astute commentary and intriguing interviews offered to XM subscribers each weekday on \"The Bob Edwards Show\".\" This was the first time that a satellite radio company provided programming to over-the-air terrestrial radio.\n\n\"Bob Edwards Weekend\" episodes are no longer available via podcast at BobEdwardsRadio.com.

Our sincerest apologies to our devoted listeners.\"\n\n\"The Bob Edwards Show\" has received several awards, including: the Deems Taylor Award from ASCAP (2006); a Gabriel Award from the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals (2006), The National Press Club's Robert L. Kozic Award for Environmental Reporting (2007) for the documentary, \"Exploding Heritage,\" about mountaintop-removal coal mining. That program was also honored with a Gabriel Award, a 2006 New York Festivals Gold World Medal, and an award from the Society of Environmental Journalists.\n\nIn 2008, \"The Bob Edwards Show\" received an Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio-Television News Directors Association and a New York Festivals/United Nations Gold Award for the documentary, \"The Invisible--Children Without Homes.\" \"The Invisible\" also was honored by the Journalism Center for Children and Families and by the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals.\n\nIn 2009, the show received a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for the documentary, \"Stories from Third Med: Surviving a Jungle ER.\" The documentary also received a Gabriel Award. In September, 2012, Edwards was named a Fellow of the Society of Professional Journalists. In 2013, the program was awarded a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for the documentary, \"An Occupational Hazard: Rape in the Military.\" The show's last live episode aired on September 26, 2014. Public Radio International, which paid Sirius XM to broadcast the show on weekends, continued to air reruns, but no longer does.\n\nIn November 2004, Edwards was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. He continues to offer verbal support for National Public Radio and helps local public radio stations with their fundraisers. Edwards serves on the board of trustees of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. He holds honorary degrees from the University of Louisville, Spalding University, Bellarmine University, Willamette University, Grinnell College, DePaul University, the University of St. Francis and Albertson College (now the College of Idaho).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "933185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=933185", "title": "CFB Goose Bay", "text": "CFB Goose Bay\n\nCanadian Forces Base Goose Bay (IATA: YYR, ICAO: CYYR), commonly referred to as CFB Goose Bay, is a Canadian Forces Base located in the municipality of Happy Valley-Goose Bay in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is operated as an air force base by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Its primary RCAF lodger unit is 5 Wing, commonly referred to as 5 Wing Goose Bay.\n\nThe airfield at CFB Goose Bay is also used by civilian aircraft, with civilian operations at the base referring to the facility as Goose Bay Airport. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.\n\nThe mission of 5 Wing is to support the defence of North American airspace, as well as to support the RCAF and allied air forces in training. 5 Wing comprises two units: 444 Combat Support Squadron (flying the CH-146 Griffon) and 5 Wing Air Reserve Flight. CFB Goose Bay also serves as a forward operating location for RCAF CF-18 Hornet aircraft and the base and surrounding area is occasionally used to support units of the Canadian Army during training exercises.\n\nWhile the flat and relatively weather-favored area around North West River had for years been under consideration for an airport for the anticipated North Atlantic air routes, it was not until Eric Fry of the Dominion Geodetic Survey investigated the area on 1 July 1941 that the Goose Bay location was selected. Fry beat by three days a similar United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) survey team under Captain Elliott Roosevelt; the American team had first investigated nearby Epinette Point before joining Fry at the sandy plains that would become Goose Bay. These surveys used amphibian aircraft that landed at the Grenfell mission; from there the teams explored by boat.\n\nEric Fry recalled: \"The airport is actually located on the plateau at the west end of Terrington Basin but it is only five miles inland from the narrows between Goose Bay and Terrington Basin. Having a Gander air base in Newfoundland I suggested we call the Labrador site Goose Bay airport and the suggestion was accepted.\"\n\nUnder pressure from Britain and the United States the Canadian Air Ministry worked at a record pace, and by November three 7,000-foot gravel runways were ready. The first land aircraft movement was recorded on 9 December 1941. By spring of 1942 the base, now carrying the wartime code-name \"Alkali\", was bursting with air traffic destined for the United Kingdom. In time, the USAAF and the British Royal Air Force (RAF) each developed sections of the triangular base for their own use, but the airport remained under overall Canadian control despite its location in the Dominion of Newfoundland, not yet a part of Canada. The 99-year lease arrangement with the United Kingdom was not finalized until October 1944.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Goose Bay, Labrador at with a variation of 35 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as \"All hard surfaced\" and had three runways listed as follows:\nThe northeast side of the facility was built to be a temporary RCAF base, complete with its own hangars and control tower, while the south side of the facility, built for the Americans, was being upgraded with its own aprons, hangars, earth covered magazines, control tower and infrastructure. The Canadian and American bases were built as an RCAF station and later a United States Air Force base known as Goose AB, housing units of the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Defense Command. It was later home to permanent detachments of the RAF, Luftwaffe, Aeronautica Militare, and Royal Netherlands Air Force, in addition to temporary deployments from several other NATO countries.\n\n\nGoose Air Base was the site of the first US nuclear weapons in Canada, when in 1950 the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command stationed 11 model 1561 Fat Man atomic bombs at the base in the summer, and flew them out in December. While returning to Davis–Monthan Air Force Base with one of the bombs on board, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber encountered engine trouble, had to drop, and conventionally detonate, the bomb over the St. Lawrence, contaminating the river with uranium-238.\n\nConstruction of Strategic Air Command's Weapons Storage Area at Goose Air Base was officially completed in 1954. The area was surrounded by two fences, topped with barbed wire. It was the highest security area in Goose Air Base and comprised\nDesign and layout of the Goose Air Base weapons storage area was identical, with only slight modifications for weather and terrain, to the three Strategic Air Command weapons storage areas in Morocco located at Sidi Slimane Air Base, Ben Guerir Air Base, and Nouasseur Air Base, which were constructed between 1951 and 1952 as overseas operational storage sites. \nThe last nuclear bomb components that were being stored at the Goose Air Base weapons storage area were removed in June 1971.\n\nConstruction of the Air Defence Command ammunition storage area at Goose Air Base was completed in 1958. This extension to the Strategic Air Command weapons storage area was built directly beside the previously constructed area, with a separate entrance. The buildings built within the area were:\nThe storage was being built to accommodate components of the GAR-11/AIM-26 \"Nuclear\" Falcon, which is normally stored in pieces, requiring assembly before use.\n\nThe former U.S. facilities were re-designated CFB Goose Bay (the second time this facility name has been used). The value of the airfield and facilities built and improved by the USAF since 1953 and transferred to Canada were estimated in excess of $250 million (USD).. By 1976 all Strategic Air Command assets had been stood down, and only USAF logistical and transport support remained.\nIn response to lessons learned from the Vietnam War and the growing sophistication of Soviet anti-aircraft radar and surface-to-air missile technology being deployed in Europe, NATO allies began looking at new doctrines in the 1970s–1980s which mandated low-level flight to evade detection. CFB Goose Bay's location in Labrador, with a population of around 30,000 and area measuring 294,000 km, made it an ideal location for low-level flight training. Labrador's sparse settlement and a local topography similar to parts of the Soviet Union, in addition to proximity to European NATO nations caused CFB Goose Bay to grow and become the primary low-level tactical training area for several NATO air forces during the 1980s.\n\nThe increased low-level flights by fighter aircraft was not without serious controversy as the Innu Nation protested these operations vociferously, claiming that the noise of aircraft travelling at supersonic speeds in close proximity to the ground (\"nap of the earth flying\") was adversely affecting wildlife, namely caribou, and was a nuisance to their way of life on their traditional lands. Many protests evolved into dangerous activities, including trespassing into the low-level flying ranges (at detriment of the safety of protesters), and even to shooting hunting rifles at the fighter aircraft.\n\nDuring the 1980s–1990s, CFB Goose Bay hosted permanent detachments from the Royal Air Force, Luftwaffe, Royal Netherlands Air Force, and the Aeronautica Militare, in addition to temporary deployments from several other NATO countries. The permanent RNAF detachment left CFB Goose Bay in the 1990s, although temporary training postings have been held since. Goose Bay was a very attractive training facility for these air forces in light of the high population concentration in their countries, as well as numerous laws preventing low-level flying. The thirteen million hectare (130,000 square km) bombing range is larger than several European countries.\n\nIn 1983, a NASA Boeing 747 transport aircraft carrying the Space Shuttle \"Enterprise\" landed at CFB Goose Bay to refuel on its way to a European tour where the prototype shuttle was then displayed in France and the United Kingdom. This was the first time that a U.S. Space Shuttle ever \"landed\" outside the United States.\n\nIn 1988, the Pinetree Line radar site (Melville Air Station) adjacent to CFB Goose Bay was closed.\n\nTo provide rescue and range support to the jet aircraft operating from Goose Bay, the Canadian Forces provided a Base Rescue Flight consisting of three CH-135 Twin Huey helicopters. In 1993 the Base Rescue Flight was re-badged as 444 Combat Support Squadron and continued to operate the same fleet of three helicopters. In 1996 the CH-135s were replaced with three CH-146 Griffon helicopters.\n\nOn 11 September 2001, CFB Goose Bay hosted seven trans-Atlantic commercial airliners which were diverted to land as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon, following the closure of North American airspace as a result of terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. It was also the first Canadian airport to receive diverted aircraft.\n\nIn 2004 the RAF announced its intent to close the permanent RAF detachment, effective 31 March 2005. The German and Italian air forces had agreements signed to use the base until 2006, however they were not renewed as of 2004. These air forces still operate at Goose Bay, but plan to initiate simulator training instead. The base continues in its role as a low-level tactical training facility and as a forward deployment location for Canadian Forces Air Command, although the total complement of Canadian Forces personnel numbers less than 100.\n\nLabradorian politicians such as former Liberal Senator Bill Rompkey have advocated using CFB Goose Bay as a site for a missile defense radar system being developed by the United States Department of Defense. Executives from defence contractor Raytheon have surveyed CFB Goose Bay as a suitable location for deploying such a radar installation.\n\nCivilian flights use a smaller terminal structure located on Zweibrucken Crescent. A new terminal structure was being built in 2012 to accommodate civilian use.\n\nAn increasing number of airliners (especially smaller range aircraft like the Boeing 757) have resorted to using Goose Bay for unplanned fuel stops, especially common for trans-Atlantic flights impacted by a seasonally strong jet stream over the North Atlantic. The majority of civilian airliners using the airfield are not regularly scheduled airlines to this location.\nThe principal components of CFB Goose Bay are :\n\n\nThe following fixed-base operators are based at CFB Goose Bay:\n\nHangar 8 at CFB Goose Bay was designated as a Canadian historic place in 2004.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6863383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6863383", "title": "DirecTV-10", "text": "DirecTV-10\n\nDirecTV-10 is a Boeing model 702 direct broadcast satellite that provides high definition television (HDTV) to DirecTV subscribers in North America. It was launched by International Launch Services on July 7, 2007 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard an Enhanced Proton Breeze-M rocket. After about two months of in-orbit testing, the satellite was moved to its operating position at 103.0° west longitude. This was the third DirecTV satellite launched on a Proton rocket. Prior launches include DirecTV-8, which was launched on May 22, 2005, and DirecTV-5, which was launched on May 7, 2002.\n\nDirecTV contracted with Boeing in 2004 to build three identical 702 model satellites — DirecTV-10, 11 and 12. DirecTV-11 was launched on March 19, 2008 and DirecTV-12 was launched on December 29, 2009. The satellites were purchased to significantly increase the number of national and local HDTV channels DirecTV offers.\n\nDirecTV-10 transmits MPEG-4 encoded signals, a compression standard which is more efficient than MPEG-2 which DirecTV uses for standard definition and a small number of HD channels. The use of MPEG-4 compression allows the satellite to carry significantly more channels than it could using MPEG-2 compression. Receiving signals from DirecTV-10 requires an advanced receiver capable of decoding MPEG-4 signals, such as the H21 or HR21, and a 5-LNB K/K dish, such as the AT-9 \"Sidecar\". These receivers also receive MPEG-2 channels and offer interactive services.\n\nDirecTV-10 and DirecTV-11 are co-located with the SPACEWAY-1 and SPACEWAY-2 satellites, respectively. The SPACEWAY satellites were originally designed so that 500 MHz of spectrum would be used for simple one-way broadcasting and 500 MHz for a broadband 2-way internet service. At the request of DirecTV, Boeing disabled the on-board processing payload designed to deliver enhanced connectivity for the 2-way internet service. DirecTV-10 and DirecTV-11 use this 500 MHz of spectrum for yet more simple one-way broadcast HDTV.\n\nSince the 500 MHz frequency block (18.3-18.8 GHz) used by DirecTV-10 and DirecTV-11 on downlink were not intended for DBS broadcasting, existing equipment cannot receive them without a B-Band Converter (BBC). DirecTV supplies BBCs with all 5-LNB K/K-band dish systems.\n\nThe satellite signal from DirecTV-10 is downconverted at the dish to the frequency range of 250-750 MHz, called \"K-lo\". At the receiver when necessary, the BBC in response to a control signal from the receiver blocks any original \"K-hi\" signals between 1650-2150 MHz. Then up-converts the 250-750 MHz signals to this range which is expected by current receivers. Because this frequency range conflicts with terrestrial broadcast frequencies, any off-the-air (OTA) diplexors must be placed at some point after the BBC.\n\nDirecTV-10 uses 32 active and 12 spare K-band Traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA) to broadcast national programming and 55 active and 15 spare spot beam TWTAs for local television services. The satellite uses bent pipe communications. It is powered by a solar array spanning 48.1 meters that consists of ultra triple junction gallium arsenide solar cells.\n\nDirecTV reported in a press release on September 14, 2007 that in-orbit testing had uncovered problems with the satellite's spot beam transponders used to broadcast local HDTV channels:\n\nWhile testing of DIRECTV 10's capability continues, it appears that a portion of the anticipated spot-beam capability may not be fully available. The investigation to determine the cause of the reduced capability and potential means to mitigate its effect is on-going. However, we currently believe our planned expansion of HD local programming as previously announced will not be materially affected.\n\nAccording to a May 7, 2010 FCC filing:\n\n\"DirecTV 10 is currently operating at the 102.815° orbital location. As DirecTV has previously informed the Commission, that satellite suffered a post launch anomaly that has limited the capacity available in certain local markets. DirecTV believes that it can ameliorate this condition, but will need to discontinue commercial service from the satellite and relocate it slightly so that it is not within the cluster of its other operational satellites. Accordingly, DirecTV intends to move DirecTV 10 to the 102.6° position to conduct the restorative procedure. During this migration, DirecTV 10 will continue to provide service to subscribers. However, over the course of this migration, DirecTV intends to transfer all traffic from DirecTV 10 to DirecTV-12, DirecTV's newest satellite which has just completed in-orbit testing and is expected to arrive at the nominal 103° location on or about May 11, 2010. At the conclusion of the STA period, the satellite will be in a position for the corrective procedure to be attempted.\" \n\nThe fixes were completed in mid June and DirecTV-10 completed its drift back to its assigned location on June 24, 2010.\n\n"}

It is sited between Golija and Javor mountains, in the Nošnica river valley. The monastery has two churches, one built partly in a cave and dedicated to the Archangel Gabriel, the other, added later, dedicated to St. Nicholas.\n\nThe monastery was founded in the 12th century. The first written reference to it is in 1606, in the \"Kruševačkom Pomeniku\". It was rebuilt in 1644 by Archbishop Gavrilo (Rašković). Records from 1733 mention it as an educational establishment.\n\nThe hegumen of the monastery is the young Serbian Orthodox Hieromonk Amvrosije. He lives there by himself with his tamed animals of two wolves, a fox, an eagle, a snake, raven, rabbit and an owl. The Serb-American community of Libertyville have donated a motorcycle and 4-wheel-drive to the monastery. The life of the monastery has been documented in the Serbian documentary \"Monah i vuk\".\n\nThe monastery consists of two temples: the first is dedicated to the Holy Archangel Gabriel and another, that was later built, is dedicated to St. Nicholas. Church of the Holy Archangel partially rests on the rock, so it can be classified in a group of ascetic cave churches. It is a single building with altar niche. It is believed to have been built in the late 12th or the early 13th century, judging by the remains of frescoes and traditions.\n\nAnother temple has a rectangular base and a dome. From frescoes dating from the 13th century, which have survived only in fragments, characters of saints are still well preserved.\n\nDuring the year 1644, Metropolitan of Raska, Gavrilo(Rašković), visits the monastery and finds it extremely neglected, in serious condition. Then he restores it and stays in it for a while, and in 1651 he endows the Monastery with a shackled and decorated Holy Gospel for the liturgical needs of the restored church of St. Nicholas, and frees the monastery land, which was returned to the monastery.\n\nFrom the records of 1733,we find that a spiritualist Filip lives in the monastery, who taught those who wanted to become priests. From all this, the monastery was highly ranked as an important place in both spiritual, as well as in national and political life of the people of this region. One of the oldest schools in Serbia was open here in 1867. There was also a school for future priests. Since 1813, the monastery performed an active function of a regular parochial school.\n\nThe monastery was restored in 2005, and the monastery refectory was built during 2007–2009.\n"}

These proposed borders are those of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States government and the Lakota. These lands are now occupied by Indian reservations and non-Native settlements. None of the existing Lakota tribal governments support the proposed republic, and they were not consulted about the proposal.\n\nFour activists, calling themselves the Lakota Freedom Delegation, traveled to Washington, D.C., on December 17, 2007, and delivered a declaring that they were, \"withdrawing from the treaties their ancestors signed with the U.S.\" and \"setting up their own independent nation.\" Reasons cited included that \"the federal government has failed to abide by 33 treaties that promised land, health care, education and other services.\" Their leader was Russell Means, one of the prominent members of the American Indian Movement in the late 1960s and 1970s. \n\nThe Lakota Freedom Delegation stated that they did not recognize tribal governments or presidents as recognized by the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, sometimes referring to these groups as \"stay-by-the-fort Indians\". Nor did any tribal governments, elected by the tribal people themselves, recognize the Republic of Lakotah.\n\nThe proposed boundaries of Lakotah are the Yellowstone River to the north, the North Platte River to the south, the Missouri River to the east and an irregular line marking the west. These borders coincide with those set by the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie:\n\nBy these claims, the largest city in Lakotah is Omaha, Nebraska. The boundaries also contain Rapid City, South Dakota; Mandan, North Dakota; Casper, Wyoming; Bellevue, Nebraska; and Mount Rushmore.\n\nIn addition to containing all the Indian reservations of the Lakota people, the territory which the republic claims includes reservations inhabited by non-Lakota Siouan peoples (the Dakota people and their communities, the Winnebago Indian Reservation and the Omaha Indian Reservation), and part of one non-Sioux reservation (the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in western North Dakota). Lakotah would also contain some of the poorest counties in the United States.\n\nOn January 1, 2008, the republic announced that it would file liens on all U.S. government-held lands within their claimed borders; however, the first round of liens, in an unnamed county in South Dakota, were rejected.\n\nFollowing this the group chose to concentrate on the Black Hills.\n\nIn July 2008, Means announced that the Republic of Lakotah would be founding an all-Lakota \"grand jury\" to investigate corruption by U.S. government officials on the seven reservations in the republic's claimed territory.\n\nMeans unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of the Oglala Lakota several times; in the 2008 election he lost 1,918 to 2,277.\n\nCitizenship in the proposed republic would be open to people of all races and to any resident of the land Lakotah claims. The group said they planned to issue their own passports and driving licenses in the name of the proposed nation.\n\nThe group proposed that the nation be organized as a confederation that would respect the libertarian principles of \"posse comitatus\" and \"caveat emptor\", would offer \"individual liberty through community rule,\" and would collect no nationwide taxes. However, individual communities within the proposed nation would be allowed to levy taxes with the consent of the taxed. Russell Means suggested that the proposed nation should not use fiat currency but instead adopt a gold standard. Means has stated that this system of government is derived from the traditional Lakota government system. Means said, \"we are going to implement how we lived prior to the Invasion. Each community will be a mini-state unto itself ... They will form the federation known as Lakotah.\" As of 2008, Russell Means identified himself as \"Chief Facilitator\" of a provisional government of the Republic of Lakotah. \n\nThe four signatories of the Lakota Freedom Delegation's letter to the United States Department of State that announced withdrawal from the U.S. identified themselves by the title of \"Itacan of Lakota\" in a press release. Leaders of communities would be informally chosen by elders of the community.\n\nThe following people identified themselves as members of the provisional government of Lakotah:\n\nThe capital of Lakotah was not announced. The Republic of Lakotah gave its provisional capital as Porcupine, South Dakota with hopes in the long run to move administration to near Rapid City, South Dakota.\n\nRussell Means and Robert Robideau were both prominent in the American Indian Movement (AIM), and later in AIM Autonomous, with Means along with Tegheya Kte having taken part in the Wounded Knee incident and Robideau acquitted in a trial related to the Leonard Peltier case. Tegheya Kte, meanwhile, led the Big Foot Riders in 2007, while Phyllis Young is one of the founders of Women of All Red Nations.\n\nThe Lakota Freedom Delegation traveled to Washington, D.C. and contacted the State Department, announcing that the Lakota were unilaterally withdrawing from the several treaties with the United States government. The delegation presented a letter, dated December 17, 2007 and signed by longtime Indian activists Russell Means, Garry Rowland, Duane Martin Sr. (aka \"Canupa Gluha Mani\"), and Phyllis Young, which declared the Lakota to be \"predecessor sovereign of Dakota Territory\" and cited gross violations of the treaties between the Lakota and the United States as the immediate cause for withdrawal. The letter also invited the United States government to enter into negotiations with the newly declared entity, there identified only as \"Lakotah\". It threatened that if good-faith negotiations were not begun then \"Lakotah will begin to administer liens against real estate transactions within the five state area of Lakotah.\"\n\nThe group also has pursued international recognition for Lakotah at the embassies of Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile, and South Africa and has claimed that Ireland and East Timor are \"very interested\" in Lakotah's declaration and that they expect recognition from Russia. Russell Means has made reference to Finland and Iceland as well.\n\nSupporters of Lakotah argue that their assertion of sovereignty is entirely legal under \"Natural, International and United States law\". The group emphasizes that the Republic's establishment comes from a \"withdrawal\" from the United States, not a secession.\n\nThey argue that as an Indian tribe in the United States, the Lakota people were already and always have been a sovereign nation as guaranteed under Article Six of the United States Constitution, bound to the United States Federal Government by treaty. As such, the legal basis of such a state's independence is argued to be the Lakota nation's withdrawal from the 1851 and 1868 Treaties of Fort Laramie, and the rejection of all United States federal laws, executive orders, and other government acts since then, in particular rejecting the Major Crimes Act, the General Allotment Act, the Citizenship Act of 1924, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the Indian Claims Commission Act, Public Law 280 and the Termination Act.\n\nThe group claims its authority to assert independence derives from a long period of discussion and preparation involving a number of traditional chiefs and tribal councils representing the following Indian reservations and communities:\n\nThe group also claims the right to withdraw, on behalf of the Lakota people, from the Treaties of Fort Laramie as a consequence of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Members argue that the decision in the case of \"Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock\", 187 U.S. 553 (1903) shows that the United States Government does not adequately protect Indian rights. Means also cites the Enabling Act of 1889, stating that clauses protecting Indian sovereignty on the lands comprising the states where the Lakota historically reside have been ignored.\n\nIn a 15 January 2008 news release, the Republic of Lakotah proposed that independence from the United States might follow a Compact of Free Association and suggested that the independence process could resemble that of the Philippines, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia or the Marshall Islands.\n\nRussell Means also stated that he intended to treat the result of the 2008 Pine Ridge Reservation Presidential election, in which he was a candidate, as a \"plebiscite/referendum\" on Lakota independence.\n\nLakotah's founders cite the Oglala 1974 Declaration of Continuing Independence:\n\nThe groups cite several reasons for its assertion of sovereignty, all connected to what they refer to as the \"colonial apartheid\" of the reservation system in the United States. The group claims that control by the United States has led to massive unemployment, poverty and disease among the Lakota people and also alleges that 150 years of U.S. administration is responsible for the statistical poverty of Lakota lands. The group claims that withdrawal from the United States will reverse these problems, and help reestablish the Lakota language and culture. The group also claims persistent violations by the United States of their treaties with the Lakota.\n\nAnother longstanding point of contention between the Lakota and the United States is the status of the Black Hills of South Dakota, which were part of Sioux reservation lands until they were taken without compensation by the US government and opened for gold mining following the collapse of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court decision \"United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians\" awarded $105 million to eight tribes of Sioux Indians as compensation ($17.1 million for the market value of the land in 1877 and $88 million in 5% per annum simple interest between 1877 and 1980), but the court did not award land. The tribal governments of the Lakota have refused the settlement.\n\nThe extent of popular support among the Lakota people for independence is unclear. Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani have claimed that some 13,000 Lakota, including 77% of the population of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, have shown support for the Republic of Lakotah, and that the eight-member delegation which traveled to Washington, D.C. was only a portion of some 77 tribal elders and activists taking part in the movement. However, \"Rapid City Journal\" reporter Bill Harlan reported on his blog that \"most folks I talk to hadn't heard about the declaration. The ones who had heard the news, to a person, did not want to talk about it on the record.\" The \"Journal\" has also noted that \"there were no tribal presidents in the group which made the announcement, no one from the top ranks of any of the Lakota Sioux tribes.\" Nanwica Kciji, an Oglala Lakota and first president of the Native American Journalists Association, has also discredited the December 2007 developments, arguing that the Lakotah Freedom Delegation \"never considered that treaties are made between nations and not individuals.\"\n\nThe Alaskan Independence Party, in an announcement dated December 21, 2007, \"applauded\" the independent Lakota nation and granted it \"full recognition\". The secessionist movement Second Vermont Republic has also announced its support, and encouraged other American Indian groups to similarly declare independence from the United States.\n\nRodney Bordeaux, chairman of the Rosebud Sioux, said that Rosebud Indian Reservation has no interest in joining the Republic of Lakotah and said that the Lakota Freedom Delegation never presented their plan to the tribal council. Bordeaux stated that the group does not represent the Lakota people nor the support of the elected tribal governments. However, he did say that Russell Means \"made some good points\".\n\nJoseph Brings Plenty, chairman of the Cheyenne River Lakota, agreed that the Lakota Freedom Delegation \"are not representative of the nation I represent\" but would not say whether he agreed or disagreed with their goals and message, noting some value in the group's actions in raising awareness for the history of the Lakota people.\n\nInternationally, according to Russell Means, Venezuela's ambassador to the United States has stated to the group that his country cannot recognize Lakotah's independence based on Venezuela's interpretation of what the Lakotah Freedom Delegation is doing.\n\nIn February 2008, the Lakotah Freedom Delegation (including Means) handed over a formal petition, asking for recognition of the Republic of Lakotah, to the embassies of Russia, Serbia, Bolivia, Venezuela, the Republic of South Africa, Ireland, France, Nicaragua, East Timor, Chile, Turkey, India, Finland, Iceland and Uruguay. The text of the petition is available online.\n\nThe United States Department of State referred queries on the subject of Lakotah to the United States Department of the Interior, which oversees the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\nGary Garrison of the BIA said that the group's withdrawal \"doesn't mean anything\". \"These are not legitimate tribal governments elected by the people ... when they begin the process of violating other people's rights, breaking the law, they're going to end up like all the other groups that have declared themselves independent — usually getting arrested and being put in jail.\"\n\nRegarding the government response, or lack thereof, Russell Means stated that, \"I don't expect the federal government to do anything. I don't believe they even know what to do.\"\n\n\n"}

The organization has local chapters in over 140 countries with over 8000 local groups worldwide that involve nearly 150,000 youth. Many of the chapters operate through schools and other organizations. Participants are encouraged to identify and work on problems in their own communities affecting people, animals, or the environment. Charity Navigator, has awarded Roots & Shoots and its parent non-profit organization, the Jane Goodall Institute, its highest four star rating for accountability and transparency with 78.1% of its expenses going directly to programs.\n\nRoots & Shoots was founded in 1991, when Dr. Goodall started to give talks at local schools in Tanzania. A group of 12 of her students selected by their classmates met with her at her home to discuss their local environmental concerns and to figure out what they could do. These 12 students became the first members of Roots & Shoots, and the organization grew from there. Of the original 12 students, one went on to serve as the minister of environment for Tanzania and another became the Roots & Shoots' national director for Tanzania.\n\nThe Roots & Shoots curriculum is a learning program for teachers and other community leaders to use with students and young people to help them develop environmental, conservationist and humanitarian programs to improve their communities. Through service projects, students develop a sense of service and leadership in their own communities. The curriculums are split into elementary, middle and high school lesson plans. The program encourages young people to create projects that support campaigns. Roots & Shoots provides resources about how to integrate these projects into the local community. One major tenant of the Roots & Shoots model is to use science and technology to map out community needs in order to find the places in a community where a campaign or service projects can help people, animals, or the environment. Roots & Shoots also uses technology to train club leaders through its massive open online course, Turning Learners into Leaders: Empowering Youth Through Service Innovation. The free professional development course provides community leaders with training on community mapping, fostering leadership in young people, collaborating with community stakeholders, and guiding young leaders towards practical solutions for community campaigns.\n\nThere are active Roots & Shoots branches in at least 27 countries, with offices in Abu Dhabi, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, China, Canada, Columbia, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Puerto Rico, Nepal, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Tanzania, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nChina has three main Roots & Shoots branches in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu that supports over 600 primarily school groups.\n\nRiverfield Country Day School in Tulsa has implemented the Roots & Shoots program.\n\nEmpire High School in Tucson has also implemented the Roots & Shoots program.\n\n"}

{"id": "531287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531287", "title": "Vesna Vulović", "text": "Vesna Vulović\n\nVesna Vulović (; ; 3 January 1950 23 December 2016) was a Serbian flight attendant. She holds the Guinness world record for surviving the highest fall without a parachute: . Her fall took place after an explosion tore through the baggage compartment of JAT Flight 367 on 26 January 1972, causing it to crash near Srbská Kamenice, Czechoslovakia. She was the sole survivor of the crash that air safety investigators attributed to a briefcase bomb. The Yugoslav authorities suspected that Croatian nationalists were to blame, but no one was ever arrested.\n\nFollowing the crash, Vulović spent days in a coma and was hospitalized for several months. She suffered a fractured skull, three broken vertebrae, two broken legs, broken ribs and a fractured pelvis. These injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. She made an almost complete recovery but continued to walk with a limp. Vulović maintained that she had no memory of the incident and thus had no qualms about flying in the aftermath of the crash. Despite her willingness to resume working as a flight attendant, JAT Yugoslav Airlines decided to give her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. The airline felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity. Vulović became a celebrity in Yugoslavia and was deemed a national hero.\n\nIn 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records recognized Vulović as the world record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in the early 1990s after taking part in anti-government protests but avoided arrest because the government was concerned about the negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the Socialist Party of Serbia was ousted from power during the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia, advocating Serbia's entry into the European Union. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she struggled with survivor's guilt. Having divorced, she lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.\n\nVesna Vulović was born in Belgrade on 3 January 1950. Her father was a businessman and her mother was a fitness instructor. Driven by her love of The Beatles, Vulović traveled to the United Kingdom after completing her first year of university, hoping to improve her English-language skills. \"I initially stayed with my parent's friends in Newbury,\" she recalled, \"but wanted to move to London. It was there that I met up with a friend who suggested we go to Stockholm. When I told my parents I was living in the Swedish capital, they thought of the drugs and the sex and told me to come home at once.\" Upon returning to Belgrade, Vulović decided to become a flight attendant after seeing one of her friends in a flight attendant's uniform. \"She looked so nice and had just been to London for the day,\" Vulović recalled. \"I thought, 'Why shouldn't I be an air hostess? I could go to London once a month'.\" She joined JAT, Yugoslavia's national flag carrier and largest airline, in 1971.\n\nThe secondary crew of JAT Flight 367, flying from Stockholm to Belgrade with stopovers in Copenhagen and Zagreb, arrived in Denmark on the morning of 25 January 1972. According to Vulović, she was not scheduled to be on Flight 367 and JAT had confused her for another flight attendant also named Vesna. Nevertheless, Vulović said that she was excited to travel to Denmark because it was her first time visiting the country. The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. \"Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family,\" she recalled. \"So I had to go shopping with them. They seemed to know that they would die. They didn't talk about it, but I saw ... I felt for them. And the captain was locked in his room for 24 hours. He didn't want to go out at all. In the morning, during breakfast, the co-pilot was talking about his son and daughter as if nobody else had a son or daughter.\"\n\nFlight 367 departed from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30 p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30 p.m., where it was taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. \"As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park,\" Vulović said. \"I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight.\" Flight 367 departed from Copenhagen Airport at 3:15 p.m. At 4:01 p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Out of the 28 passengers and crew, Vulović was the only survivor of the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during World War II and was able to keep her alive until rescuers arrived at the scene.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1982, Croatian nationalists carried out 128 terror attacks against Yugoslav civilian and military targets. The Yugoslav authorities suspected that they were to blame for bringing down Flight 367. The same day as the crash, a bomb exploded aboard a train travelling from Vienna to Zagreb, injuring six. A man, describing himself as a Croatian nationalist, called the Swedish newspaper \"Kvällsposten\" the following day and claimed responsibility for the bombing of Flight 367. No arrests were ever made. The Czechoslovak Civil Aviation Authority later attributed the explosion to a briefcase bomb.\n\nFollowing the crash, Vulović spent days in a coma, having fractured her skull and then hemorrhaged. She also suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely. Her pelvis was fractured and several ribs broken. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total amnesia from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović's parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquilized. The last thing that Vulović could remember from before the crash was greeting passengers as they boarded. The next thing she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.\n\nVulović underwent treatment in a Prague hospital until 12 March 1972, after which she was flown to Belgrade. She was offered a hypnotic injection to help her sleep during the flight back to Yugoslavia, but declined, explaining that she was not afraid of flying because she had no memory of the crash. In Belgrade, Vulović's hospital room was placed under 24-hour police protection because the authorities feared that the perpetrators of the bombing would want to kill her. The guards changed shifts every six hours, and no one was allowed in to see her except for her parents and doctors. Her hospitalization in Belgrade lasted until June 1972, after which she travelled to Montenegro to recuperate at a seaside resort, where her doctors visited her every two or three days. Vulović underwent several operations to restore her movement. At first, she could only move her left leg, and one month thereafter, she was once again able to move her right. Vulović's parents had to sell both of their cars to pay for her medical bills. Within ten months of her fall, Vulović had regained the ability to walk, but continued to limp for the rest of her life, her spine permanently twisted. In total, she spent 16 months recuperating. \"Nobody ever expected me to live this long,\" she recounted in 2008. Vulović attributed her recovery to her \"Serbian stubbornness\" and \"a childhood diet that included chocolate, spinach, and fish oil.\"\n\nAir safety investigators attributed Vulović's survival to her being trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it broke away from the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were blown out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.\n\nIn September 1972, Vulović expressed willingness to resume working as a flight attendant. The airline felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. In Yugoslavia, Vulović was celebrated as a national hero. Her reputation as a \"Cold War heroine\" also extended to the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. After the crash, Vulović received a decoration from Yugoslavia's leader, Josip Broz Tito, and the Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song titled \"Vesna stjuardesa\" (\"Vesna the Stewardess\"). She was soon made an honourary citizen of Srbská Kamenice. Honke's granddaughter, born six weeks after Vulović's fall, was named Vesna in her honour. Vulović continued to fly regularly, stating that other passengers were surprised to see her on flights and wanted to sit next to her.\n\nVulović's parents both died within a few years of her fall. In 1977, she married the mechanical engineer Nikola Breka after a year of dating. Although Vulović was advised by physicians that her injuries would not have an adverse effect on her reproductive function, she experienced an ectopic pregnancy that nearly proved fatal and was never able to have children. In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records recognized her as the world record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute: . She received the recognition at a London gala from musician Paul McCartney. Vulović was thus officially acknowledged as having surpassed the records of other fall survivors, such as Alan Magee, Nicholas Alkemade, and Ivan Chisov.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Vulović and her husband divorced. Vulović attributed the divorce to her chain smoking, which her husband disapproved of. Around the same time, Vulović was fired from JAT for speaking out against Serbian statesman Slobodan Milošević and taking part in anti-government protests. She avoided arrest because the government was concerned about the negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. In response to her activism, pro-Milošević tabloids launched a smear campaign against her, claiming that Flight 367 had been shot down by a Czechoslovak surface-to-air missile and that she had fallen from a lesser height than previously believed. Vulović continued taking part in anti-government demonstrations throughout the 1990s. When Milošević and his Socialist Party of Serbia were ousted in the Bulldozer Revolution of October 2000, Vulović was among several celebrities who took to the balcony of Belgrade's city hall to make victory addresses. She later campaigned on behalf of the Democratic Party of Serbia and advocated for Serbia's entry into the European Union, which she believed would bring economic prosperity.\n\nVulović told reporters that she did not think of her fall every day, but admitted to struggling with survivor's guilt. \"Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry ... Then I think maybe I should not have survived at all.\" Vulović declined therapy to help cope with her experiences and instead turned to religion, becoming a devout Orthodox Christian. She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an optimist. \"If you can survive what I survived,\" she said, \"you can survive anything.\"\n\nIn 2005, Vulović's fall was recreated by the American television program \"MythBusters\". Four years later, Peter Hornung-Andersen and Pavel Theiner, two Prague-based journalists, claimed that Flight 367 had been mistaken for an enemy aircraft and shot down by the Czechoslovak Air Force at an altitude of . The two claimed that the Czechoslovak State Security had conjured up Vulović's record fall as part of a cover-up. They also hypothesized that the call received by the \"Kvällsposten\", claiming responsibility for the aircraft's downing, was a hoax. The Czech Civil Aviation Authority dismissed the journalists' claim, calling it a conspiracy theory. Hornung-Andersen conceded that the pair's evidence was only circumstantial. Vulović said that she was aware of the journalists' claims, but stated that because she had no memory of the event, she could not confirm or deny the allegations. Guinness World Records continues to list her as the record-holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute.\n\nIn the last years of her life, Vulović lived on a pension of €300 per month in her dilapidated Belgrade apartment. \"I don't know what to say when people say I was lucky,\" she remarked. \"Life is so hard today.\" Vulović lamented that her mother and father may not have died prematurely had she not been aboard Flight 367, stating that the incident not only ruined her life, but also that of her parents. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC, saying that she was \"tired\" of discussing her fall. By the time she had reached her sixties, Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years.\n\nIn December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door.

Then Prime Minister Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa commissioned the service.\n\nThe nation's growing commitment informed the need to have an external channel through which authoritative information about the African situation could be disseminated to the entire world. Even then, its transmission, using a 10 kW HF transmitter, was limited to West Africa for two hours daily in English and French. Broadcast hours increased to six in 1963 with the commissioning of five prototype RCA 100 kW transmitters.\n\nIn 1989, five Brown Boveri transmitters with antennae system were acquired. On January 5, 1990, VON became autonomous, and in 1996, three state-of-the-art 250 kW Thomcast AG transmitters were commissioned. This boosted VON's transmission to the entire world. The transmitting station is located on 40 hectares at Ipokodo, Ikorodu in Lagos State. While the administrative headquarters is in Abuja, the Federal Capital, News and Programmes emanate from both the Lagos and Abuja studios. In 2012, VON commissioned another state of the art multi-billion naira transmitting station at Lugbe, Abuja.\n\nPowers and Functions\n\nAccording to the Act establishing Voice of Nigeria, the following are some of its powers and functions\nThe Corporation shall, to the exclusion of any other broadcasting authority or any other body in Nigeria, be responsible for broadcasting externally, by radio, Nigeria’s viewpoint to any part of the world. \n(1)provide as a public service, in the interest of Nigeria, radio broadcasting services for global reception in such languages and at such time as the Corporation may specify; \n(2) The Corporation shall ensure that its services reflect views of Nigeria as a Federation and give adequate expression to the culture, characteristics, affairs and opinions of Nigeria. \n(3) The Corporation shall ensure that news and programmes enhance Nigeria’s foreign policy and image.\n\n“To become the international radio broadcasting station of first choice for anyone interested in Nigeria and Africa”.\n\n“Reflecting Nigerian and African perspective in our broadcast, winning and sustaining the attention, respect and goodwill of listeners worldwide particularly Nigerians and Africans in the Diaspora and making Nigeria’s voice to be heard more positively in the shaping of our world”\n\n\n"}

Famous advocates of world federalism include Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Rosika Schwimmer, Albert Camus, Winston Churchill, Garry Davis, Emery Reves, Wendell Willkie, Jawaharlal Nehru, E. B. White and Lola Maverick Lloyd. The organization was created in 1947 by those concerned that the structure of the new United Nations was too similar to the League of Nations which had failed to prevent World War II, both being loosely structured associations of sovereign nation-states, with few autonomous powers.\n\nThe World Federalist Movement has member and associate organizations around the world. The movement currently counts 30,000 to 50,000 supporters. Notably active world federalist organizations, as of 2018, exist in Australia, Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The World Federalist Council, in which active members from around the world meet once a year, is tasked with supporting the creation of new organizations where these do not yet exist. \n\n In the aftermath of World Wars I and II, activists around the world were forming organizations bent on creating a new international system that could prevent another global war.\n\nThe first world federalist organization was founded in 1937 by two famous feminists, pacifists, and female suffragists: Rosika Schwimmer and Lola Maverick Lloyd. In 1938, the Federal Union was organized in the United Kingdom. In the U.S., Federal Union (now: Association to Unite the Democracies) was established in 1939 calling for a federation of the Atlantic democracies. The Swiss Internationale Bewegung der Weltföderalisten-Schweiz\nwas created in Geneva in 1940. During World War II, anti-fascist resistance movements shared clandestinely circulated copies of Altiero Spinelli's plan for European federation and global federation. Spinelli later became one of the founding fathers of the European Union. In 1945, the Committee to Frame a World Constitution convened at the University of Chicago and drafted a Constitution for the World. In 1947, five small world federalist organizations came together in Asheville, North Carolina and agreed to merge as the United World Federalists.\n\nThese five groups had, in the previous year, met with representatives of fifteen others in Montreux to discuss creating a worldwide federalist organization. It was one year later, in August 1947, also in Montreux, that more than 51 organizations from 24 countries came together at the Conference of the World Movement for World Federal Government. The Conference concluded with the Montreux Declaration.\n\nBy its second congress in 1948 in Luxembourg, the Movement consisted of 150,000 members of 19 nationalities and 50 member and affiliated organizations. The 350 participants in the Congress laid the groundwork for an association of parliamentarians for world government, which came into being in 1951.\n\nFederalists had hoped that the anticipated UN review conference (under Article 109 of the UN Charter) in 1955 would move the UN further in the direction of a world federal system. Unfortunately, the lack of political will dissipated any interest in such a conference. Around 1965 however, the Movement had established offices near the United Nations, with American federalist Marion McVitty as the Movement's UN observer and advocate.\n\nFederalists in this period focused on amendments to the United Nations Charter as a way forward. Most involved reforms to institutions such as a more representative Security Council, a World Court with compulsory jurisdiction and judicial review authority and a democratically elected General Assembly (or a world parliament). Federalists proposed a number of new institutions such as a commission on sustainable development, an international development authority, a standing peacekeeping corps and an international criminal court.\n\nThe WFM International Secretariat is based in New York City, across from the headquarters of the United Nations, and hosts the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect and serves as an steering committee member in the 1 For 7 Billion coalition. It has had Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1970 and is affiliated with the UN Department of Public Information (DPI) and a current board member of the Conference of NGOs (CONGO). The Institute for Global Policy (IGP), founded in 1983 by the World Federalist Movement, is a research and policy institute dedicated to the promotion of human security, international justice, the prevention of armed conflict and the protection of civilians. The Institute emphasizes the democratization of international and regional organizations and the development and global application of international law. Most recently, WFM-IGP has been at the forefront of advocating for NGO access to international conferences and meetings.\n\nWFM-IGP is composed of autonomous national and regional organizations organized by individual supporters in their respective countries. In applying to the governing Council for membership, organizations are asked to endorse the and to demonstrate a \"capacity to contribute to the enhancement of public and political support\" for the Movement's goals.\n\nThe World Federalist Movement has Member Organizations (MOs) and Associate Organizations around the world, including Citizens for Global Solutions, Union of European Federalists, World Federalist Movement-Canada, The Universal Party, and the World Federalist Movement of Japan. Others include Democratic World Federalists, One World Trust, Committee for a Democratic UN, and the Ugandan World Federalists. The WFM umbrella organization also includes the Coalition for the International Criminal Court and the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect.\n\nHistorically, members have included:\n\n\nIn 2017, the WFM-IPC's executive committee included:\n\n\n"}

Like many folk songs, variations exist, but one version has lyrics as follows, compiled by Seán Og and Manus O Baoill:\n\nOn the Mudcat Café site at Mudcat, one author \"Áine\" notes that her grandmother sung a different chorus. Much of this, however, appears to be an attempt at a phonetic rendering of the above, the exception being the \"socair sásta\" line (\"safe and happy\"). Much of what's below is incorrect Irish (Ínionaí\" is not an Irish word, and \"cois an chlé mo\" doesn't actually make sense, as it literally means \"at the foot of the left/clay my\"), but it does SOUND a good deal like the version above when read aloud, which is why it's assumed to be an attempted phonetic rendering rather than actual Irish words:\n\nThe rough English translation of this song:\n\n"}
