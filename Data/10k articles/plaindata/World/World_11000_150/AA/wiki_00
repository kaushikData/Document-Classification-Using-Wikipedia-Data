{"id": "210911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210911", "title": "Astra (satellite)", "text": "Astra (satellite)\n\nAstra is the brand name for a number of geostationary communication satellites, both individually and as a group, which are owned and operated by SES S.A., a global satellite operator based in Betzdorf, in eastern Luxembourg. The name is also used to describe the pan-European broadcasting system provided by these satellites, the channels carried on them, and even the reception equipment.\n\nAt the time of the launch of the first Astra satellite, Astra 1A in 1988, the satellite's operator was known as Société Européenne des Satellites. In 2001 SES Astra, a newly formed subsidiary of SES, operated the Astra satellites and in September 2011, SES Astra was consolidated back into the parent company, which by this time also operated other satellite families such as AMC, and NSS.\n\nAstra satellites broadcast 2,600 digital television channels (675 in high definition) via five main satellite orbital positions to households across Asia, Australia, Africa, Americas, Europe, New Zealand, Middle East and North Africa. The satellites have been instrumental in the establishment of satellite TV and the introduction of digital TV, HDTV, 3D TV, and HbbTV in Europe.\n\nA book, \"High Above\", telling the story of the creation and development of the Astra satellites and their contribution to developments in the European TV and media industry, was published in April 2010 to mark the 25th Anniversary of SES.\n\nThere are 16 operational Astra satellites, the majority in five orbital locations - Astra 19.2°E, Astra 28.2°E, Astra 23.5°E, Astra 5°E, Astra 31.5°E. Astra's principle of \"co-location\" (several satellites are maintained close to each other, all within a cube with a size of 150 km) increases flexibility and redundancy.\nAstra satellites have been designed by Boeing Satellite Systems (formerly Hughes Space and Communications), Airbus Defence and Space (formerly Astrium), Alcatel Space, and Lockheed Martin. The Astra satellites within a family are not identical, for example of the Astra 2 satellites; 2A and 2C are BSS 601HPs, 2B is an Astrium Eurostar E2000+ and 2D is a BSS 376.\n\nThe satellites have been launched by Arianespace rockets from Kourou, French Guiana, International Launch Services Proton rockets from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and ILS Atlas rockets from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA. The satellites are launched into an elliptical \"temporary transfer orbit\" from where they use onboard propulsion to reach their final circular geostationary orbits, at nearly altitude. Proton rockets fitted with a fourth stage propulsion unit are capable of launching the satellites several thousand kilometres higher (at the closest point of the elliptical orbit) than Ariane rockets. As a result, most satellites launched in this way have to use less fuel to reach their geostationary orbit, increasing their lifetime.\n\nThe Sirius series of satellites (not connected with the North American Sirius Satellite Radio service) was started in 1993 with the purchase of the BSB Marcopolo 1 satellite (renamed Sirius 1) by Nordic Satellite AB (NSAB) for direct to home broadcasts to the Nordic and Baltic regions from the 5° east orbital position. Subsequent satellites launched to this location include Sirius 2 (1997), Sirius 3 (1998) and Sirius 4 (2007) and the position's coverage has been expanded to include Eastern Europe and Africa.\n\nIn 2000, SES (then SES Astra) bought the 50% shareholding in NSAB owned by Teracom and Tele Danmark and in 2003 increased that holding to 75%, renaming the company SES Sirius AB. In 2008 Astra acquired further shares to take its shareholding in SES Sirius to 90% and in March 2010 took full control of the company. In June 2010, the affiliate company was renamed SES Astra and the Sirius 4 satellite renamed Astra 4A.\n\nThe Astra 4A designation was originally given in 2005 to part of the NSS-10 craft (33 transponders) owned by another subsidiary of SES, SES New Skies, and positioned at 37.5° west for broadcast, data, and telecommunications into Africa, and in 2007 to part of the Sirius 4 satellite (six transponders of the FSS Africa beam) owned and operated by SES Sirius. From June 2010, the Astra 4A designation has applied to the entire satellite previously known as Sirius 4.\n\nAstra 1K, the largest commercial communications satellite ever built at the time, was ordered by SES in 1997. It was launched by Proton rocket on November 26, 2002. The rocket lifted off as planned and reached its parking orbit at which point the final stage of the rocket was to initiate a second burn to transfer the satellite to its geostationary orbit. This did not occur and the satellite was released into the parking orbit, making it unusable. The only way to recover the satellite would have been the use of a Space Shuttle, however this was rejected. On December 10, 2002 SES instructed Alcatel Space (the manufacturer) and the French Space Agency CNES to deorbit the satellite, it broke up on re-entry over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOn January 16, 2009 Astra 5A at 31.5° east \"experienced a technical anomaly leading to the end of the spacecraft’s mission\" some four years ahead of the spacecraft's expected end of life. Traffic carried by the satellite (especially channels for German cable service, Kabel Deutschland) was transferred to Astra 23.5°E. In March 2009, SES (then SES Astra) announced that in April, the Astra 2C satellite was to be moved from the 28.2° east position to 31.5° east to temporarily take over Astra 5A's mission until Astra 3B is launched to 23.5° east, when another craft currently there can be released to 31.5° east. The move of Astra 2C was started in May and completed on May 11 with the first transponders coming into use at the new position in the subsequent two weeks.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Astra satellite broadcasts were received in 156 million households in Europe. In all, 35% of all European TV households receive DTH satellite TV, 26% receive cable TV, 12% receive IPTV, and 27% receive terrestrial broadcasts. With provision via DTH, cable and IPTV, 61% of European TV homes receive TV from Astra satellites. 71% of all European homes that receive satellite TV, receive TV from Astra satellites; and 93% of all homes that receive IPTV or cable, receive TV from Astra satellites.\n\n"}

This family-owned bank was Gibraltar’s oldest bank, though it did not incorporate until August 1978. (Before that it was a partnership.) In 1987 Jyske Bank acquired Banco Galliano renaming it Jyske Bank (Gibraltar) Limited.\n\nFrom the latter half of the 19th century, Galliano's bank started to face competition. The Anglo-Egyptian Bank (later Barclays) opened a branch in 1888, and Credit Foncier (later Crédit Agricole) entered in 1920. There were also, by the start of the 20th century, four other small, family-owned banks - Cuby Brothers, Benzecry (\"El Banquerito\"), Rugeroni Brothers, and Marrache and Sons - but by 1940 these had ceased operating.\n\nA.L. Galliano Bankers survived the Great Depression, the Spanish Civil War, and both world wars, albeit with difficulty. Gibraltarian Francis (Paco) Galliano OBE, the last Galliano to own and run the bank, entered the bank in 1944 at the age of 17. He became a partner in 1953 and the senior partner in 1964. His son, Frank Galliano was General Manager until the takeover.\n\nIn 1822, Spanish the guitar-maker Joséf Pagés made a Spanish guitar that came to belong to members of the Galliano family.

Following the Summit, the World Health Assembly which governs the World Health Organization passed Resolution 58.2, 4-5 endorsing the \"Mexico Statement On Health Research: Knowledge for better health\" developed during the Summit. In the statement, Ministers of Health and delegates called \"for national governments to establish sustainable programs to support evidence-based public health and health care delivery systems, and evidence-based health related policies.\" Resolution 58.34 made a call \"to establish or strengthen mechanisms to transfer knowledge in support of evidence-based public health and health-care delivery systems, and evidence-based health-related policies\". Developments relevant to EVIPNet are regularly reported to the Advisory Committee on Health Research of the World Health Organization and of its Regional Offices.\n\nIn March 2009 the EVIPNet Secretariat presented to WHO’s Advisory Committee on Health Research a capacity building strategy that assesed through a validated tool the knowledge needs with respect to a defined set of skills for EVIPNet teams, allowing a strategic and organized approach to capacity building. Similarly, WHO Regional Advisory Committees on Health Research monitor progress and provide key guidance to EVIPNet efforts.\n\nEVIPNet gained great momentum in Africa where policy briefs soon became available.. The enthusiasm had spread also to the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean, and after a coordination meeting organized by WHO in Addis Ababa in October 2015, it gained traction in the European region as well. By then, the Global Steering Group working with WHO Collaborating Centers (e.g. WHO Collaborating Centre for Evidence-Informed Policy, at McMaster University)and specialized centers such as BIREME, the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information - had set up one-stop shops that enabled access to specialized collections of indexed policy briefs, systematic reviews, policy documents and other relevant resources, as one of the shared resources for the global EVIPNet networks. For example, the free access portals (with registration) of Health Systems Evidence and Health Evidence. \n\nIn October 2016 The World Health Organization published an executive summary and document entitled \"Evipnet 10 years 10 stories\" with a selection of cases describing impacts of EVIPNet at country level. \n\nIn the meanwhile, the platform expanded especially in the European region. \n\nIn November-December 2016, PAHO's 46th Advisory Committee on Health Research convened and its report, issued in 2017, provided updates on EVIPNet and knoweldge translation efforts in the Americas.. The meeting was informed by a preliminary version of a Report on Strengthening Research Capacities in the Caribbean that described EVIPNet related technical cooperation in that region. \n\nIn July 2018 The BMJ published a special series on the policy on research for health of the Pan American Health Organization (that applies to the Secretariat and Member States) featuring EVIPNet in the article on Advancing public health and health systems through evidence-informed policy in the Americas. .\n\nEVIPNet operated by forming country or regional-level teams composed of policy makers, researchers and representatives from other sectors (e.g. science & technology, education, civil society organizations, patient advocates, topic experts, local networks, etc.). These teams identify and address country priority topics where a perceived need to strengthen the systematic use of research evidence to inform decisions about policies for health has been identified. EVIPNet therefore includes components relevant to research and development and claims to help strengthen national health research systems.\n\nBy providing a common purpose to team members EVIPNet facilitates that different sectors jointly address specific priorities and develop and use specific skills to assess research evidence and integrate it into policies. Frequent outputs of EVIPNet teams are policy briefs that integrate evidence with context and values on succinct and helpful documents that inform decisions by high level decision makers. Several EVIPNet teams have already delivered useful relevant outputs such as Policy Briefs and deliverative dialogues that have informed policy at national and local levels.\n\nTo join EVIPNet country health authorities establish a formal commitment with the Secretariat and develop a work proposal. The Secretariat of EVIPNet is composed by staff from the research policy teams of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva and its Regional Offices. The EVIPNet Secretariat supports country teams so that they produce robust proposals. EVIPNet has Steering Groups (in the regional and global network) and resource groups in each region. These groups work with experts and networks to provide feedback and expertise to the country teams.\n\nThe Secretariat works with country teams to identify and address skill needs and deliver targeted capacity building activities in collaboration with networks and partners (e.g. SUPPORT Collaboration, McMaster Health Forum, Cochrane Collaboration, etc.)\n\nAs EVIPNet expands and develops it has been highlighted as a worthy approach featured in prominent strategy documents addressing development and capacity building for research for health. It remains relevant as reflected in the call to action issued at the Global Ministerial Forum on Research for Health in Bamako in November 2008 by ministers and ministerial representatives from 53 countries. EVIPNet was also featured in at least 12 different presentations at the First Global Symposium on Health Systems Research (Montreux, Switzerland, 2010), and is frequently featured at Colloquiums of the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations, and Global Forums on Health Research (e.g. Bamako 2008, Havana 2009).\n\nEVIPNet has also allowed for the development of customized resources that have helped advance their work and knowledge about health systems research. For example, the SUPPORT Tools for Evidence Informed Policy Making (available in various languages), the Evidence Portal, or the McMaster Database on Health Systems Evidence with >1800 systematic reviews on health systems evidence.\n\nEVIPNet has also become a tool for PAHO/WHO technical programs offering an integrated approach to technical cooperation; in PAHO/WHO research focal points in country offices are part of EVIPNet teams, and technical programs have adopted EVIPNet methods to provide an integrated technical cooperation.\n\n\n"}

The line-up included guitarist David Gilmour and saxophonist Dick Parry. Gilmour went on to join the band Pink Floyd and Parry went on to become a session musician, playing on three Pink Floyd studio albums and one live album. Parry also went on to join Gilmour's 2006 solo tour.\n\nTheir only releases were a privately pressed, single-sided studio album (carrying catalogue number RSLP 007) and single (RSR 0031), of which only forty or fifty copies each were made. These were recorded at Regent Sound studio in Denmark Street, London. A tape recording of the LP is held by the British Library's British Library Sound Archive.\n\nTogether with record producer Jonathan King, they recorded what was to have been a UK cover version of Sam & Dave's \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\", but the original was released in the UK, so Jokers Wild's version was not released.\n\n\nWills later played with, Peter Frampton, Foreigner and Bad Company. Both he and Wilson played on David Gilmour's eponymous first solo album; Parry played on four Pink Floyd records, \"Dark Side of the Moon\", \"Wish You Were Here\", \"Division Bell\" and the live double album \"Pulse\" and had a career as a session musician.\n\nWilson later played drums and bass on Syd Barrett's solo albums, \"The Madcap Laughs\" and \"Barrett\", the later sessions of which were produced by Gilmour.

Self-proclaimed \"King of All Media\".\n\nRobin Ophelia Quivers is a native of Baltimore, Maryland, and first met Stern after being assigned as his newswoman at WWDC in March 1981. She has been his co-host and news reader ever since. She is a former nurse and Captain in the United States Air Force. Quivers briefly left the show towards the end of her time at WWDC when Stern made a deal at WNBC in 1982, and did not realize WNBC initially refused to hire her. Quivers returned to the show at WNBC a month after Stern.\n\nStern once said that Quivers is the only person on the show that he allowed to talk freely during the broadcast, although comedian Artie Lange was allowed this privilege as well during his years on the show.\n\nOf the show's staff, Stern met Norris first, in 1979, when the two worked as disc jockeys at WCCC in Hartford, Connecticut. Norris worked the overnight slot, after which Stern hosted the morning slot. Although Stern left shortly afterwards, Norris stayed at WCCC until joining Stern and Quivers at Washington, D.C.'s WWDC in 1981. The \"Earth Dog Fred\" nickname originated in Washington, as Norris replaced an engineer nicknamed \"Earth Dog Brent.\"\n\nNorris is married to Allison (née Furman) and they have one daughter, Tess.\n\nNorris' current role on the show is to provide sound effects, organize and direct commercials and live reads, and occasionally perform writing duties. Norris also provides impersonations of show regulars, celebrities and others.\n\nGeorge Takei occasionally serves as the show's announcer. Before joining the show, Takei became popular among the cast after soundbites of his audiobook about his career on \"\" were played on the show. The clips stood out due to his deep baritone voice and pitch perfect enunciation, and, thus, were frequently played on the show. In 2006, when the show moved to Sirius, Stern announced that Takei was the show's official announcer.\n\nThese are the behind-the-scenes personnel, although in the Stern world, many of these staff members appear on air.\n\nBrandano, previously known as \"Steve The Intern,\" answers Stern's phones, is a contributor on \"The Wrap-Up Show\", and was formerly the host of the Thursday night intern show.\n\nBenjy Bronk (born Sept. 4, 1967) began working on \"The Howard Stern Show\" as an intern in 1998. Bronk eventually earned a paid position conducting pre-interviews of show guests and gathering articles for Robin Quivers' news. In 2000, Benjy was given an in-studio seat next to writers Jackie Martling and Fred Norris, writing on-the-spot jokes for Stern as the show transpired.\n\nAfter Martling left the show in early 2001, Bronk continued as an in-studio joke writer with Norris. When the Howard Stern Show moved to Sirius satellite radio in January 2006, Bronk continued in his role as an in-studio joke writer. In October 2016, he was banished from the studio indefinitely after arriving late for work, the last in a long history of tardiness.\n\nWhile working as an electrician in Florida and playing as a drummer in a number of heavy metal bands including Iced Earth and Death, Christy began calling into the show from October 1999, initially sending voice mails to the show's assistant producer K. C. Armstrong, which were played on-air. From 2001 to 2003, Christy sent song parodies and bits about Armstrong and show co-host Robin Quivers including some like \"It's K.C.'s Sausage Party\" (a parody of \"It's My Party\") and \"Gay Photograph\" (a parody of the Def Leppard song \"Photograph\") that continue to be played on the show to this day. Christy made his first visit to the show on April 24, 2003, where he played a round of blackjack to win a date with a porn star.\n\nIn July 2004, when the show was holding a \"Win John's Job\" contest following the departure of Stuttering John from the show, Christy won the position as voted by fans. Since joining the show, Christy has become known for his prank calls, song parodies, unique personality, and \"show stunts\" he's performed with his writing partner Sal the Stockbroker.\n\nChristy is currently the drummer in the heavy-metal band Charred Walls of the Damned.\n\nGary Dell'Abate, aka Baba Booey, serves as the show's head producer. Hired right after graduating from Adelphi University in 1984 and briefly anglicizing his name to Gary Dell, he has worked for the show ever since. Dell'Abate is mocked on the Stern Show for his appearance, gullibility (he once booked a mentally challenged woman who claimed to be Madonna's sister), and frequent mispronunciations (for example, insisting that actor Nick Nolte's last name was pronounced \"Nolt\"). He earned the nickname \"Baba Booey\" after insisting it to be the correct name of the cartoon character Baba Looey.\n\nSalvatore \"Sal\" Governale, sometimes referred to as Sal the Stockbroker, was originally a frequent caller who worked as a stockbroker. Stern took notice after numerous calls mocking Gary Dell'Abate. Although he came in second in the \"Win John's Job\" contest to his future writing partner, Richard Christy, Sal was eventually hired as a prank caller/writer for the show, and is now credited as a producer.\n\nBorn in December 1979 in Fairborn, Ohio, Jamie Daniel \"J. D.\" Harmeyer is Stern's head media producer. He records television shows, pulls clips from the internet and edits together highlights from recent happenings in movies and TV. He attended Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida.\n\nJon Hein made his first guest appearances on the show on May 3, 2001, discussing television shows that have \"jumped the shark\", a term he uses to describe when a show has passed its prime (based on an episode of the show, \"Happy Days\", where a previously popular and well-done show clearly and memorably began to go downhill). In late 2005, while experimental programming was broadcast on Howard 100 and Howard 101, Hein presented the first edition of \"Superfan Roundtable\". His success in on-air hosting led him to become the co-host of \"The Wrap-Up Show\" when the show moved to Sirius XM in January 2006.\n\nHein is also a cohost on the weekly Thursday show, \"Jon Hein's TV Show\" with J. D. Harmeyer, Steve Brandano, and Jenny Hutt, as well as the weekly Friday show \"Geek Time\" with Jason Kaplan and Ralph Cirella. The show has since been cancelled.\n\nJason Kaplan is a senior producer for the show. He has many duties, including writing the daily show rundown that appears on the show's website, and taking photos that appear alongside the daily rundown. In September 2007, Jason and HowardTV director Scott DePace engaged in an intense feud stemming from their political differences.\n\nJason was married to his girlfriend, Janis on November 8, 2008. Notable guests at the ceremony included Howard Stern, Robin Quivers, Gary Dell'Abate, as well as the majority of Stern's staff. The reception featured speeches from fellow staff members, Ronnie Mund and J. D. Harmeyer. Kaplan hosts \"Page 69\" along with Will Murray. On the wrap-up show on August 19, Kaplan stated that he grew up in Stanhope, NJ and attended Rutgers University.\n\nKaplan hosted a monthly show called \"The Fat Guy Show,\". Kaplan is also a producer of the monthly show \"Geek Time\" that airs on every Friday with Jon Hein and Ralph Cirella.\n\nRonald Mund, commonly referred to as Ronnie the Limo Driver, is Stern's limousine driver and bodyguard, and the head of security for the Stern show complex at Sirius Radio. After a career in the Air Force, Mund started a limo business. He started driving for Stern in 1986, and quickly became a character on the radio show. In 2011, Ronnie began touring the US with other talent from \"The Howard Stern Show\" on the Ronnie Mund Block Party. In March 2013, Ronnie hosted a 4-day event in Jamaica called the Ronnie Mund Jamaican Getaway.\n\nWill Murray is the show's researcher and segment producer. He preinterviews all guests, and compiles pages of notes of research for Howard to use during interviews. He and fellow producer Jason Kaplan host the Howard 100 News segment \"Page 69.\"\n\nOn September 5, 2008, Will married his long-time girlfriend. A Philadelphia area native, he is a huge Philadelphia sports fan, and is a graduate of Syracuse University.\n\nScott the Engineer is the show's long-time engineer, having joined on February 10, 1986. Having previously worked at WABC (AM) and WPLJ in New York City, Salem received a voice mail from Jimmy Fink, then the morning personality at WXRK informing him of his new position.\n\nIn 1996, the \"Austin American-Statesman\" wrote that Scott is \"always threatening to quit or on the verge of being fired, he's the show's whipping boy for technical problems\". In 2007, Salem made a onetime appearance on tour with the Killers of Comedy, performing stand-up followed by a Q&A session with the audience. Salem is an avid bowler and has competed in and appeared at several PBA tour events.\n\nRon Tarrant\n\nRon Tarrant joined the Howard Stern Channels in 2016 from Canada as the Head Imaging/Sound Designer & new voice of the Howard Stern Show/Channels.\n\nMike Trainor joined the show in 2014 as writer and producer.\n\nMarci Turk is chief operating officer of Stern's channels. A former employee of author David Allen, she is a prominent advocator of his \"Getting Things Done\" method of time management.\n\nThe Howard 100 News team reports on events that relate to the Howard Stern Universe.\n\nShuli Egar is a comedian who first appeared on the show in June 2003. When Stern announced his planned move to Sirius and created Howard 100 News in 2005, Egar was an early hire. He was quickly promoted to The Wack Pack beat and also filled in for Lisa G and Steve Langford when they were out. As of 2016, he is the only original member of the Howard 100 News team that remains on staff.\n\nJon Leiberman is an in-studio and remote correspondent for Howard 100 News who was hired in July 2011.\n\nThe Tapes Team produces specials out of the archives of the Howard Stern Show, such as \"Howard Stern: The Peacock Years\", \"The Gayest Week Ever\", \"The History of Howard Stern\", as well as the daily and weekend editions of Sternthology. Members of this team do not appear on the air.\n\n\nGreg Fitzsimmons is the host of \"The Greg Fitzsimmons Show\" on Howard 101.\n\nThe following people all saw significant air-time when they worked with Stern. Some were either show staffers who went on to bigger and better things, interns, Stern's bosses, and station support staff who for a time were all integral to the show.\n\nKyle Casey \"K. C.\" Armstrong (born July 17, 1975), who grew up in nearby Suffolk County, New York, began working on the show as an intern in 1997 and later became associate producer from 1998 to 2004. In a 2005 interview, Armstrong revealed that he had been fired from the show by WXRK general manager Tom Chiusano for lapsing back into drug use after spending time in rehab.\n\nArmstrong eventually moved to California, where he tried to start a career in acting. He released a comedy DVD called \"Die Laughing\". He has acted in three movies – \"Death4Told\", \"Grace and the Storm\" and \"Secret War\" and appears on the comedy DVD series \"Meet the Creeps\".\n\n\"Boy\" Lee Davis was the original Stern show producer at WNBC before Gary Dell'Abate. He left to become the producer of the Soupy Sales show.\n\nSteve \"the Engineer\" Freid first worked with Ben Stern and later worked with Howard when he arrived at K-Rock. He gained notoriety performing as the character Wood Yi, a parody of actor/director Woody Allen. Billy West came up with the idea for the character in the early 1990s, and Steve was chosen to play the part due to having a similar-sounding voice. When performing as Wood Yi, Steve read lines supplied to him by the shows' staff, reciting them in a deadpan manner.\n\nGary Garver was a West Coast-based correspondent for \"The Howard Stern Show\" who first started working for the show in 1991 when he was an operator at KLSX, the show's Los Angeles affiliate. He was sent to awards shows, movie premieres and television conventions to ask \"Stuttering John\"-type questions to celebrities and has-beens.\n\nFormer Stern Show intern and associate producer at WXRK, known as \"Gorilla\". Howard dedicated his second book \"Miss America\" to Steve. Grillo conducted movie reviews for Howard 100 News in 2006. As homage to his former duties as a Stern show intern, he rated films by awarding them a certain number of potatoes.\n\nLange's first appearance on the show was as a guest alongside fellow comedian Norm Macdonald on January 8, 1998, following a bit involving Scott the Engineer and his challenge to perform 17 complete push-ups. Although appearing with Macdonald to promote the film \"Dirty Work\", Lange had been a fan of Stern since the 1980s when he used to listen with his father. In fact, after Lange's father was paralyzed in 1987, show producer Gary Dell'Abate sent Lange an autographed jacket which Lange auctioned off for $2,000 to help support his family.\n\nFollowing the departure of the show's writer and comedian Jackie \"The Jokeman\" Martling in 2001, several comedians \"auditioned\" for Martling's seat by sitting in for a couple of shows. Lange's first appearance in what became known as \"The Jackie Chair\" occurred for 2 days, on May 7 and 8, 2001. The temporary appearance consisted of being Stern's sidekick along with Quivers, and Lange frequently told personal stories, usually regarding alcohol, drugs, food and prostitutes. On October 29, 2001, Lange joined the show full-time and was voted favorite by Howard's fans in 2009.\n\nLange left the show in December 2009. At first the leave was thought to be temporary, but in early 2010 he attempted suicide at his apartment in Hoboken, New Jersey. The incident has not been discussed in great detail on the show and for much of 2010, Stern mentioned that Lange would return when he was healthy. However, in 2011 the show and the Howard 100 News began to reference Lange as a \"former\" staffer. On October 3, 2011, Lange began co-hosting \"The Nick & Artie Show\" with comedian Nick DiPaolo. This show aired on Directv. In April 2014, Artie was informed before the show that Directv had cancelled his show. He went on air that night for the last time as a part of the Directv team. He currently is the host of a podcast called \"The Artie Lange Uncensored Podcast.\"\n\nIn 1988, Stuttering John was attending New York University's film school, and belonged to a band called \"Rock Slide\". His college roommate, Mitch Fatel, was on the verge of quitting his internship with \"The Howard Stern Show\", when Melendez begged him for a recommendation for an internship on the show. Producer Gary Dell'Abate interviewed Melendez and mentioned his stuttering problem to Stern, who decided to hire him as a field reporter.\n\nOn Stern's show, Melendez conducted outrageous street interviews and appeared at press conferences, asking off-the-wall questions to various celebrities, including Gennifer Flowers, Ringo Starr, Burt Reynolds, Tommy Lasorda, Larry King and the Dalai Lama. He also provided comic relief on the show itself with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation. Melendez left the show after being offered a half-million dollar contract as the announcer for \"The Tonight Show\" with Jay Leno.\n\nAl Rosenberg was a writer/performer for Howard on WNBC. He did numerous voice impressions including Sue Simmons and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. In \"The History of Howard Stern\", Howard stated that he hired Al after Imus fired him so that he (Imus) could hire his girlfriend to replace Rosenberg. He stayed on at WNBC after Howard was fired because he was still under contract to the station. Al also worked on WNEW-AM radio as one half of the morning team with Bob Fitzsimmons. He also worked with Ted Brown. He later worked again for Howard on the \"Channel 9 Show\" as a writer. Al called into Stern's show in 2007 (during a Paul Mooney interview) to discuss Imus' racism.

He also serves on the board of Rise, a non-profit organization and currently serves as Deputy Mayor for East Windsor Township, New Jersey.\n\nBilly West provided the show with comedy impersonations, part-time, beginning on November 7, 1988. He was known for his impressions of Marge Schott and show comedian Jackie Martling. West's final appearance was on November 1, 1995, before he left the show over contract and salary disputes. On February 19 and 20, 2007, a special two-part retrospective of West's work on the show was broadcast on Howard 100 and Howard 101, covering over 11 hours.\n\nWest was an occasional contributor to \"The Adam Carolla Show\", a syndicated morning radio show that replaced Stern in cities along the West Coast.\n\n\"Bubba the Love Sponge\" is both the title of, and name of the host of, a radio show airing on Howard 101 from 2005 to the end of 2010. Bubba (actual legal name Bubba The Love Sponge Clem, born Todd Clem) had previously been \"exiled\" from radio after a great deal of controversy over his terrestrial radio show, based in Tampa, Florida. Stern brought Bubba's show aboard and in so doing relaunched Bubba's career and show.

He hosted the \"Miserable Men\" show and created a series of roasts for Stern show personalities such as Gary Dell'Abate, Artie Lange, and Wack Packers such as Daniel Carver. The placement, frequency and number of plugs given during the Stern show for Levy's off-air efforts was a constant source of tension, especially after the availability of plugs was severely restricted. After Artie's departure, Levy complained on air that some details of the situation were being \"covered up\" and blamed Howard Stern for the suicide attempt. Levy's departure from the Stern channels soon followed and he is almost never mentioned on the air.\n\nScott Ferrall was the host of \"The Scott Ferrall Show\" heard weekdays at 8 pm EST on Howard 101.

{"id": "893014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=893014", "title": "New Swabia", "text": "New Swabia\n\nNew Swabia (Norwegian and ) is a cartographic name sometimes given to an area of Antarctica between 20°E and 10°W in Queen Maud Land, which is claimed as a Norwegian dependent territory under the Antarctic Treaty System. New Swabia was explored by Germany in early 1939 and named after that expedition's ship, the , itself named after the German region of Swabia.\n\nLike many other countries, Germany sent expeditions to the Antarctic region in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of which were scientific. The late 19th century expeditions to the Southern Ocean, South Georgia, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Crozet Islands were astronomical, meteorological, and hydrological, mostly in close collaboration with scientific teams from other countries. As the 19th century ended Germany began to focus on Antarctica.\n\nThe first German expedition to Antarctica was the Gauss expedition from 1901 to 1903. Led by Arctic veteran and geology professor Erich von Drygalski, this was the first expedition to use a hot-air balloon in Antarctica. It also found and named Kaiser Wilhelm II Land. The second German Antarctic expedition (1911–1912) was led by Wilhelm Filchner with a goal of crossing Antarctica to learn if it was one piece of land. As happened with other such early attempts, the crossing failed before it even began. The expedition discovered and named the Luitpold Coast and the Filchner Ice Shelf. A German whaling fleet was put to sea in 1937 and, upon its successful return in early 1938, plans for a third German Antarctic expedition were drawn up.\n\nThe third German Antarctic Expedition (1938–1939) was led by Alfred Ritscher (1879–1963), a captain in the German Navy. The main purpose was to find an area in Antarctica for a German whaling station, as a way to increase Germany's production of fat. Whale oil was then the most important raw material for the production of margarine and soap in Germany and the country was the second largest purchaser of Norwegian whale oil, importing some 200,000 metric tonnes annually. Besides the disadvantage of being dependent on imports, it was thought that Germany would soon be at war, which was considered to put too much strain on Germany's foreign currency reserves. Another goal was to scout possible locations for a German naval base.\nOn 17 December 1938 the New Swabia Expedition left Hamburg for Antarctica aboard the MS \"Schwabenland\" (a freighter built in 1925 and renamed in 1934 after the Swabia region in southern Germany) which could also carry and catapult aircraft. The secret expedition had 33 members plus the \"Schwabenland\"'s crew of 24. On 19 January 1939 the ship arrived at the Princess Martha Coast, in an area which had lately been claimed by Norway as Queen Maud Land and began charting the region. Nazi German flags were placed on the sea ice along the coast. Naming the area \"Neu-Schwabenland\" after the ship, the expedition established a temporary base and in the following weeks teams walked along the coast recording claim reservations on hills and other significant landmarks. Seven photographic survey flights were made by the ship’s two Dornier Wal seaplanes named \"Passat\" and \"Boreas\". About a dozen 1.2 meter-long aluminum arrows, with 30 centimeter steel cones and three upper stabilizer wings embossed with swastikas, were air dropped onto the ice at turning points of the flight polygons (these arrows had been tested on the Pasterze glacier in Austria before the expedition). Eight more flights were made to areas of keen interest and on these trips some of the photos were taken with colour film. Altogether they flew over hundreds of thousands of square kilometres and took more than 16,000 aerial photographs, some of which were published after the war by Ritscher. The ice-free Schirmacher Oasis, which now hosts the Maitri and Novolazarevskaya research stations, was spotted from the air by Richardheinrich Schirmacher (who named it after himself) shortly before the \"Schwabenland\" left the Antarctic coast on 6 February 1939.\n\nOn its return trip to Germany the expedition made oceanographic studies near Bouvet Island and Fernando de Noronha, arriving back in Hamburg on 11 April 1939. Meanwhile, the Norwegian government had learned about the expedition through reports from whalers along the coast of Queen Maud Land. Although some, notably Norwegian writer Bjarne Aagaard and German geographer Ernst Herrmann, have claimed that Germany never actually occupied the territory, it is well documented that Germany issued a decree about the establishment of a German Antarctic Sector called New Swabia after the expedition's return in August 1939.\n\nBecause the area was first explored by a German expedition, the name \"Neuschwabenland\" (\"New Swabia\") is still used for the region on some maps, as are many of the German names given to its geographic features. Some geographic features mapped by the expedition were not named until the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) (1949–1952), led by John Schjelderup Giæver. Others were not named until they were remapped from aerial photographs taken by the Norwegian Antarctic Expedition (1958–1959).\n\nGermany made no formal territorial claims to New Swabia. No whaling station or other lasting bases were built there by Germany until the Georg-von-Neumayer-Station, a research facility, was established in 1981. Germany's current Neumayer-Station III is also in the region. New Swabia is a cartographic area of Queen Maud Land which within Norway is administered as a Norwegian dependent territory under the Antarctic Treaty System by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police.\n\n\n\n"}

Thomas the younger joined his father’s business early in the 19th century, as did at least three of his brothers, Nathan, George and Samuel. Thomas Sturge & Sons, oil merchants and spermaceti processors operated from premises near Elephant and Castle, Newington Butts, until 1840.\n\nHe was a first cousin of social reformer and philanthropist Joseph Sturge.\n\nThomas Sturge junior had become the senior partner in the business by 1816, when he began to buy ships and send them to the Southern Whale Fishery to obtain whale oil, seal oil and spermaceti for processing and sale in London. He became the principal owner of at least 23 vessels, most of them South Sea whalers.\n\nHis Quaker faith and values were reflected in his business dealings. He tried to choose committed Christians to command his whale ships and in his sailing instructions gave his captains detailed advice on how to treat their crewmen. His vessels each seem to have been supplied with a small library and at least five of his vessels carried a \"surgeon\" or ship's doctor. One of these was Dr Thomas Beale who later wrote, \"The Natural History of the Sperm Whale\" (1839), which he dedicated to his employer. Herman Melville drew on the book for his novel \"Moby Dick\" (1851). The book also inspired three paintings of whaling scenes by J.M.W. Turner, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1845 and 1846. Turner tried to sell them to his patron, oil merchant, shipowner and art collector Elhanan Bicknell. Bicknell was an associate and friend of Sturge at Newington Butts.\n\nSturge was a member of a committee to assist “distressed seaman” by 1818. His firm donated £15 15 shillings in 1821 toward the cost of a suitable vessel to serve as a floating hospital for the “assistance and relief of sick and helpless seamen.” The Seamen's Hospital Society was established that year, with William Wilberforce as one of the many vice presidents; Sturge was one of a couple of dozen men on its management committee, along with Zachary Macaulay and Captain William Young.\n\nHe was a member of the Anti-Slavery Society and substantial financial contributor to the cause. Another member of the society was the historian and poitician Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859) who became friends with Sturge. There were many Quakers in the abolition movement. Among these was his cousin the prominent anti-slavery abolitionist and philanthropist Joseph Sturge (1793-1859).\n\nThomas also made regular donations to a range of other charitable causes. He provided transport to missionaries going to the South Seas on his whaling ships. Robert Moffat and his wife left their children in the care of Sturge and his invalid sister when they were in South Africa in the 1860s. Thomas or his father, Thomas senior, was supporting the education of the deaf by May 1821.\n\n In 1838 Sturge joined a group of London shipowners to purchase two vessels, the schooner \"Eliza Scott\" (154 tons) and the cutter \"Sabrina\" (54 tons). These were sent to the Antarctic, under the overall command of Captain John Balleny, to search for undiscovered offshore islands that might host seal colonies that could be harvested. Among the discoveries made were a cluster five previously unknown islands. They were given the collective name of the Balleny Islands with individual islands named after those who had funded the expedition. Sturge Island is 23 miles long and 6 miles wide and permantly covered in a mantle of snow and ice.\n\nIn 1837 and 1838 he purchased two blocks of land on the Thames near Northfleet at a cost of £9,313. On that 74 acre plot he built a cement works to make Portland cement. Construction of the cement kilns started in 1851 and production began in 1853.\n\nHe was interested in the building of new railways and in 1842 he spoke at a public meeting in favour of the construction of the Dean Forest and Gloucester railway line. He became a significanr shareholder in the Eastern Union Railway Company and a major shareholder and director of the West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway Company.\n\nIn 1842 he moved downriver to Northfleet, where he had purchased Northfleet House, a mansion under construction, for £3900. Thomas Sturge the younger died there on April 14, 1866. He never married and most of his estate, valued at about £180,000, was left to his brother George.\n\n"}
