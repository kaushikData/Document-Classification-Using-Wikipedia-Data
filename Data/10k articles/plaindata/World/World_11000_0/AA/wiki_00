It was race 1 of 8 in both the 1961 World Championship of Drivers and the 1961 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. It was also the first World Championship race under the new 1.5 litre engine regulations.\n\nThe erratic yearly variations in Monaco's qualifying regulations saw grid places guaranteed for works teams and past winners in 1961. Therefore, the five works teams were awarded two places each on the grid, while Stirling Moss and Maurice Trintignant earned spots. This left nine drivers to fight over four remaining slots. A fifth opened up when Innes Ireland crashed during the final practice session, breaking his leg. Moss took pole position from Richie Ginther and Jim Clark, with Graham Hill and Phil Hill on the second row.\n\nGinther led Clark and Moss into the first corner but Clark quickly ran into trouble with a faulty fuel pump. Ginther dropped to third on lap 14, when Moss and Bonnier passed him in quick succession. At quarter distance, Moss had an impressive 10 second lead (in the underpowered Lotus 18-Climax) but the Ferraris of Hill and then Ginther found their way around Bonnier and began to close the gap. At half distance, Moss' lead was 8 seconds, and down to 3 seconds on lap 60. Ginther moved into second on lap 75 and tried to close the gap, but Moss proved able to match his lap times, despite the 156's horsepower advantage.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19174448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19174448", "title": "Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa", "text": "Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa\n\nAl-Qaeda has conducted operations and recruited members in Africa. It has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa and supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.\n\nAn insurgency is being waged by the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (which is called today as the al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb) against the Algerian government. It is a spin-off to the Algerian Civil War that ended in 2002, and has been linked to bombings in Algiers, Batna and Dellys in 2007.\n\nThe group has declared its intention to attack Algerian, French, American and Spanish targets. It has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the U.S. Department of State, and similarly classed as a terrorist organization by the European Union.\n\nAs soon as the allied Somali and Ethiopian forces drove the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) out of Somalia in January 2007, U.S. accused Eritrea of providing safe haven for some of their leadership. America also condemned Eritrea since it continued to \"fund, arm, train and advise the insurgents\" attacking the Somalia government. According to a regional Somali government, some Eritrean soldiers were also sighted working with Arab and al-Qaeda fighters against the Somalian government, and the foreign alliance attacked government positions.\n\nIn 2007 there were reports that the Eritrean government is sheltering the leadership of the insurgency in Somalia. The United Nations continued to report of Eritrean assistance to Somalis with alleged links to al-Qaeda. Accordingly, the UN Security Council said that Eritrea has secretly supplied \"huge quantities of arms\" to a Somali insurgent group with alleged ties to al Qaeda, in violation of an international arms embargo and despite the deployment of African peacekeepers\" adding that it has been \"provided to the al-Shabaab (an extremist group which emerged within the ICU’s armed forces and is led by a kinsman and protégé of the ICU council leader Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, Aden Hashi Farah \"Eyrow\", who trained in Afghanistan with al-Qaeda before returning to Somalia after 9/11) by and through Eritrea\" since December 2006. Sheikh Aweys himself and other members of the Islamic Courts Union who are wanted by the U.S. over suspected links to al-Qaeda (the UN has Sheikh Aweys on a list of individuals \"belonging to or associated with\" al Qaeda, which he denies) organized a congress in Eritrea to strengthen their militant opposition to the Somalia transitional government.\n\nIn 2002 another successful terrorist attack in Kenya after the U.S. embassy bombing, a car bomb attack on a Mombasa resort hotel popular among Israeli tourists claimed the lives of 15 people. The hotel bombing occurred 20 minutes after a failed attack on an airplane, when a terrorist fired an SA-7 man-portable air-defense system against an Israeli airliner carrying 261 passengers, which was taking off from the airport; the missile seemingly failed to track its target, nor did it detonate, and landed in an empty field.\n\nOn 3 November 2007, al-Zawahiri claimed in a 28-minute recording posted on an Islamic website that \"... members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group announce that they are joining the al-Qaeda group ...\" According to Al Jazeera, Abu al-Laith appeared to be the leader of the new Libyan wing. Fighting Islamic Group first announced its presence in 1995, vowing to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader. In 2001, the group was added to a UN list of individuals and institutions \"belonging to, or associated with, al-Qaeda\".\n\nAbdelhakim Belhadj, a prominent rebel commander during the 2011 Libyan civil war, in an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore admit that many of his recruits had al-Qaeda links. One of the major factions within the Libyan National Liberation Army was the Libyan Islamic Movement. The group, formerly known as the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, is well known to have had links to Maghreb faction of al-Qaeda.\n\nOn 1 November 2011, less than a month after the death of Muammar Gaddafi, the al-Qaeda flag was seen flying off the roof of a courthouse in Benghazi's city center.\n\nThe extent of al-Qaeda's involvement is not yet known. Concerns have been voiced about what role MI6 played in collaborating with the Libyan Islamic Movement. The White House Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan said \"I'm concerned about what is going on inside of Libya because there's been a fair amount of disorder and upheaval in the country\", \"The weapons stock piles - whether we're talking about missile systems or we're talking about automatic weapons - these are things that we and our European allies are working very closely with the TNC [Transitional National Council] and Libyan authorities to get some control over. It's a big country, there were a lot of weapons depots that were scattered throughout the country and we're working again with the TNC and Europeans as well as the regional states. [...] (we are) very concerned about making sure that we do everything possible to prevent al-Qaeda from acquiring these weapons and threatening them.\".\n\nIn February 2012, al-Shabaab officially pledged loyalty to Al-Qaeda. In an audio message to Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, the al-Shabaab leader said: \"On behalf of the soldiers and the commanders in al-Shabaab, we pledge allegiance to you. So lead us to the path of jihad and martyrdom that was drawn by our imam, the martyr Osama.\"\n\nActivities of al-Qaeda in Somalia are alleged to have begun as early as 1992. The organization's role during the course of the 1992–1994 UN missions was limited to a handful of trainers. Ali Mohamed and other al-Qaeda members purportedly trained forces loyal to fraction leader Mohammed Farah Aidid. Osama bin Laden himself claimed in an interview with ABC's John Miller to have sent al-Qaeda operatives to Somalia. One of the al-Qaeda fighters present during the interview claimed to have personally slit the throats of three American soldiers in Somalia. Mark Bowden, author of \"Black Hawk Down\", states the terrorist organization did train some of Aidid's men, but they were not personally part of the fight with US forces in the 1993 battle of Mogadishu.\n\nAl-Qaeda was also linked to militant Islamic Courts Union (ICU) front in Somalia. It is believed several terrorist attacks were orchestrated from Ras Kamboni, in the extreme southern tip of Somalia adjacent to Kenya, including the 1998 United States embassy bombings and the 2002 Mombasa hotel bombing. On June 22, 2006, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer announced the U.S. was seeking the assistance of the ICU in the apprehension of suspects who carried out attacks against its East African embassies and a hotel in Kenya. She listed the following persons as suspected of being in Somalia (name and nationality): Fazul Abdullah Mohamed (Comoros), Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan (Kenya), and Abu Taha al-Sudan (Sudan). When the ICU did not cooperate, the U.S. first financed the rival factions, and then followed with limited air strikes as the ICU rule in Mogadishu fell in the face of Ethiopian Army assault. The Pentagon said a high level al-Qaeda member from the ICU was captured in Somalia and transferred to the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the ICU, Al-Qaeda reportedly established strong ties with the Al-Shabaab splinter group.\n\nIn September 2009, it is thought that the Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan was killed during a military raid in Somalia. He was a top Al-Qaeda suspect and was thought to be responsible for attacks on a hotel in Kenya and on an Israeli airliner in 2002.\n\nIn 1991, Sudan's National Islamic Front, an Islamist group that had recently gained power, invited al-Qaeda to move operations to Sudan. For several years, al-Qaeda operated several businesses (including import/export, farm, and construction firms) in what might be considered a period of financial consolidation. The group built a major 1200-km (845-mi) highway connecting the capital Khartoum with Port Sudan. However, they also ran a number of camps where they trained operatives in the use of firearms and explosives.\n\nIn 1996, Osama bin Laden was asked to leave Sudan after the United States put the regime under extreme pressure to expel him, citing possible connections to the 1994 attempted assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak while his motorcade was in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Controversy exists regarding whether Sudan offered to turn bin Laden over to the U.S. prior to the expulsion. There is an audio tape (Audio) (Transcript) recording of former President Bill Clinton talking about the offer from the Sudanese government. There are conflicting reports on whether the Sudanese government indeed made such an offer, but they were in fact prepared to turn him over to Saudi Arabia, who declined to take him.\n\nOsama bin Laden finally left Sudan in a well-executed operation, arriving at Jalalabad, Afghanistan by air in late 1996 with over 200 of his supporters and their families.\n\n"}

Interest in the contest had been great for a long time, despite the local Andorran broadcaster, Ràdio i Televisió d'Andorra (RTVA), not showing the contest until recent years (citizens could watch it on Spanish and French stations). A majority of the songs have so far been sung in Catalan, the national language of Andorra.\n\nAs of 2019, Andorra is the only country to have participated in the contest and never to have featured in the final.\n\nDespite the homeland interest in the competition, Andorra has never qualified for the final. In 2007, a qualification for the final was predicted, but with a 12th-place finish, it just missed out. In the past RTVA held a large reality show contest to select its entry for Eurovision. From 2006, RTVA held an internal selection process to select the Andorran entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.\nRTVA confirmed its participation in the 2009 contest in Moscow, Russia. It announced that there would be a public selection process - something not seen in the country since 2005. Andorra's 2009 entry once again failed to qualify, getting only 8 points in the semifinal.\n\nIn the finals, Andorra has always given its 12 points to Spain, with the exception of 2007. As the two nations are neighbouring, this has done very little to dispel accusations of political voting which have been going on for a long time. In December 2009, RTVA announced that Andorra would withdraw from the 2010 Contest due to a lack of funding for an Andorran entry. This came after RTVA submitted an entry for the contest, in case funding could be found to submit an entry. However no funding could be found, and so Andorra was forced to withdraw.\n\nAndorra did not participate in the 2011 contest due to financial difficulties, or in the 2012 contest, for the same reason. Andorra did not participate in subsequent contests.\n\nOn 8 November 2011, it was announced by the Andorran broadcaster, RTVA, that they would leave the EBU, due to financial reasons and a cut of subsidies from the Andorran government. After a meeting with the EBU director Ingrid Deltenre in June 2012, RTVA decided to stay in the EBU, but said participation in Eurovision is still unlikely.\n\n\n\nAs of , Andorra's voting history is as follows:\n\n"}

{"id": "212741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212741", "title": "Commonwealth Secretariat", "text": "Commonwealth Secretariat\n\nThe Commonwealth Secretariat is the main intergovernmental agency and central institution of the Commonwealth of Nations. It is responsible for facilitating co-operation between members; organising meetings, including the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGM); assisting and advising on policy development; and providing assistance to countries in implementing the decisions and policies of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Secretariat has observer status in the United Nations General Assembly. It is located at Marlborough House in London, the United Kingdom, a former royal residence that was given by Queen Elizabeth II, Head of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Secretariat was established by Heads of Government in 1965, taking over many of the functions of the United Kingdom Government's Commonwealth Relations Office, as part of a major shake-up of the organisation of the Commonwealth. At the same time, the United Kingdom succeeded in advocating the creation of the Secretariat's sister organisation, the Commonwealth Foundation was founded to foster non-governmental relations and the promotion of the Commonwealth Family network of civil societies. Other attempts by members to create similar central bodies, such as a medical conference (proposed by New Zealand), a development bank (Jamaica), and an institution for satellite communications (Canada) failed.\n\nThe creation of the Secretariat itself was a contentious issue. The United Kingdom and other long-established countries had hoped to slow the tide of expansion of Commonwealth membership to prevent the dilution of their traditional power within the Commonwealth (particularly after the admission of Cyprus). This may have involved a dual-tiered Commonwealth, requiring the continuation of the organisation of Commonwealth co-operation by meetings, rather than a central administration. However, the new African members were keener to create an independent inter-governmental 'central clearing house' (as Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah described it) to remove power from the older dominions. Milton Obote of Uganda was the first to propose a specifically titled 'secretariat', which was then formally proposed by Eric Williams of Trinidad and Tobago, who wished to see it based upon the secretariats of the OAS, EEC, and OAU.\n\nEarlier attempts at the formation of a central secretariat had been made and failed. Australia had proposed the establishment four times (in 1907, 1924, 1932, and 1944), whilst New Zealand had also made proposals in 1909 and 1956.\n\nThe chief executive of the Secretariat, and of the Commonwealth as a whole, is the Commonwealth Secretary-General. All Secretariat staff report to the secretary-general, who is also responsible for spending the Secretariat's budget, which is granted by the Heads of Government. It is the secretary-general, and not the ceremonial Head of the Commonwealth, that represents the Commonwealth publicly. The secretary-general is elected by the Heads of Government at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings for terms of four years; previously, until 2000, a term was five years. The current Secretary-General is Dominica's Patricia Scotland, who replaced Kamalesh Sharma as Secretary-General on 1 April 2016.\n\nThe secretary-general is assisted by three deputy secretaries-general: one responsible for economic affairs (currently Deodat Maharaj), one for political affairs (Josephine Ojiambo), and one for corporate affairs (Gary Dunn). The secretary-general may appoint junior staff at his own discretion, provided the Secretariat can afford it, whilst the more senior staff may be appointed only from a shortlist of nominations from the Heads of Government. In practice, the secretary-general has more power than this; member governments consult the secretary-general on nominations, and the secretary-general has also at times submitted nominations of his own.\n\nAll members of staff are exempt from income tax, under the International Organisations Act 2005, which redefined the legal status of the Secretariat.\n\nThe Secretariat is headquartered at Marlborough House, in London, the United Kingdom. Marlborough House is located on Pall Mall, Westminster, next to St. James's Palace, which is formally the location of the British Royal Court. Marlborough House was previously a royal residence in its own right, but was given by Queen Elizabeth II, the Head of the Commonwealth, to the British government in September 1959 for use for Commonwealth purposes. This was first realised three years later. Another three years later, in 1965, the building passed to the Secretariat upon its foundation. The building itself was designed by Sir Christopher Wren and served as the London residence of the dukes of Marlborough until it was given to Princess Charlotte in 1817.\n\nThe Commonwealth Secretariat Act 1966, which applied retroactively from the establishment of the Secretariat in 1965, first granted the organisation full diplomatic immunity. This has been subjected to a number of lawsuits challenging this, including \"Mohsin v Commonwealth Secretariat\", and in 2005, \"Sumukan Limited v Commonwealth Secretariat\". The 1966 Act had been interpreted by English courts as allowing the courts to exercise supervisory jurisdiction under the Arbitration Act 1996 over the Commonwealth's arbitration tribunal, which had been envisaged as the sole organ to arbitrate on matters related to the Secretariat's operations in the United Kingdom. In light of this interpretation, the Commonwealth Secretariat Act was amended by the International Organisations Act 2005, which gave the Commonwealth Secretariat Arbitral Tribunal the same legal immunity as the Secretariat itself, guaranteeing independence of the English courts.\n\n\n"}

So doing, the Institute aims to promote a more integrated understanding of present-day Asian realities as well as to pioneer new approaches to Asian Studies in a changing global context, and, more specifically, to contribute to new humanistically-informed and policy-relevant knowledge about Asia. \n\nThe International Institute for Asian Studies was established in 1993, following recommendations by two successive committees, installed by the Dutch Ministry of Education and Science (1989) and the Royal Netherlands Institute for Arts and Sciences (KNAW).\n\nThe city of Leiden was only a logical choice for the Institute’s headquarters. Leiden is home to many institutes with expertise and resources about Asia, including Leiden University, the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV), the Siebold House Japanmuseum, the Netherlands Institute for the Near East (NINO), the National Museum of Ethnology and the National Museum of Antiquities. \n\nThe International Institute for Asian Studies was, and still is, hosted by Leiden University, which provides office space as well as administrative and IT services. From 1997 to 2012, IIAS also had a branch office in Amsterdam, facilitated by the University of Amsterdam. \n\nIIAS receives its core funding from the Ministry of Education. The Institute additionally generates income from external sources, via grants, subsidies, and the joint execution of programmes. \n\nWhile upholding its original mission, the Institute has over the years adapted and expanded its programmatic agenda in response to the demands of a changing global context.\n\nActivities include multi-year research programmes and the building of academic networks, the organisation of international conferences and roundtables, a fellowship and a publication programme, PhD in-situ masterclasses, and the publication of a free periodical on Asian Studies (titled, \"The Newsletter\"). \n\nThe following current programmes and networks are among the Institute's main initiatives:\n\n\n"}

Most Khmuic peoples live in northern Laos and neighboring areas in Vietnam, although they can also be found in Thailand, Burma and China.\n\nThe individual Khmuic ethnic groups are as follows:\nOther two groups: Khmu Chuang and Khmu Kaye are extinct or were assimilated in other ethnic groups especially Khmu Chuang was believed to be extinct, absorbed or assimilated by or into Khmer. In the ancient time, the Khmu Chuang lived in the southern part of Khmuic territory which is the area of the present day southern Laos). The Khmu Kaye lived in the eastern part of Khmuic territory which is the area of the present day Xiengkhuang province. Be in mind that some scholars confuse Khmu Cheuang [cɯaŋ] and Khmu Chuang [cuaŋ]. These two groups are not the same, Khmu Cheuang are still exist in the present day and mostly live in northwestern of Vietnam.\n\nThe following are individual ethnic groups which some scholars misunderstand that they are Khmu and speak Khmuic. In fact they are much different from Khmu, in both language and culture. There are only a few words (less than 10%) of their vocabularies that resemble Khmuic.\nThere are also the Khao and Bit peoples which were once thought to be Khmuic, although recent linguistic studies suggest they are probably Palaungic.\n\nThe Khmuic peoples are believed to have migrated by land from China to Laos, where they have resided for at least 4,000 years. Some 10,000 years ago, they were probably part of a largely homogenous ethnicity, now referred to as the Austro-Asiatic peoples, with a homeland somewhere within the borders of the modern-day People's Republic of China. The prevalence of Y-DNA Haplogroup O among Austro-Asiatic peoples suggests a common ancestry with the Sino-Tibetan, Austronesian, and Hmong–Mien peoples some 35,000 years ago in China. Haplogroup O is a subclade of Y-DNA Haplogroup K, which is believed to have originated approximately 40,000 years ago somewhere between Iran and Central China. In addition to the ethnicities previously mentioned, the progenitor of Haplogroup K was the patrilineal ancestor of nearly all modern Melanesians and Native Americans. Haplogroup K, in turn, is a subclade of Y-DNA Haplogroup F, which is believed to have originated in Northern Africa some 45,000 years ago. In addition to the ethnicities previously mentioned, the progenitor of Haplogroup F was probably the ancestor of all Indo-Europeans.\n\nTheir languages belong to the Khmuic language family, which is a branch of the Austro-Asiatic language family. Most scholars agree that the Khmuic languages are part of the Mon–Khmer branch of the Austro-Asiatic family, but the validity of the Mon–Khmer branch has recently been called into question.\n\nThe Khmuic are generally an agricultural people, although gathering, hunting, trapping and fishing are also parts of the Khmuic lifestyle.\n\n"}

The princely family of Liechtenstein, after which the sovereign principality was named in 1719, hails from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria, which the family possessed from at least 1140 to the thirteenth century, and from 1807 onward. It is the only remaining European monarchy that practises strict agnatic primogeniture, meaning only first-born males may inherit the throne.\n\nThrough the centuries, the dynasty acquired vast swathes of land, predominantly in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia, and Styria, though in all cases, these territories were held in fief under other more senior feudal lords, particularly under various lines of the Habsburg family, to whom several Liechtenstein princes served as close advisors. \n\nWithout any territory held immediately from the Imperial crown, the Liechtenstein family, although noble, did not qualify for a seat in the \"Diet\" of the Holy Roman Empire. By purchase in 1699 and 1712 from the Counts of Waldburg-Zeil-Hohenem of, respectively, the small \"Herrschaft\" (lordship) of Schellenberg and the countship of Vaduz, the Liechtensteins acquired immediate lands within the Holy Roman Empire which made them eligible for elevation to the Imperial Diet. Thereby, on 23 January 1719 Emperor Charles VI decreed Vaduz and Schellenberg were henceforth united and raised to the status of a \"Fürstentum\" (principality) under the name \"Liechtenstein\" for \"[his] true servant, Anton Florian von Liechtenstein\". \n\nAlthough the family continued to own larger territories in various parts of central and eastern Europe, it was in right of Liechtenstein's status as an Imperial estate that the family of wealthy noble Austrian courtiers became a dynasty of imperial princes, continuing to dwell in the imperial capital of Vienna or on their larger estates elsewhere, not taking up permanent residence in their principality for more than 300 years, moving into their Alpine realm only in 1938, after dissolution of both the Holy Roman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nThe Prince of Liechtenstein has broad powers, which include the appointment of judges, the dismissal of ministers or government, veto power, and the calling of referendums. The Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003 was a proposal put forth by reigning Prince Hans-Adam II to revise parts of the Constitution of Liechtenstein, on the one hand expanding the monarch's power with the authority to veto legislation, while on the other hand securing for the citizenry the option to abolish the monarchy by vote at any time without being subject to princely veto. The right of the parishes that make up the principality to secede was simultaneously recognised.\n\nPrince Hans-Adam had warned that he and his family would move to Austria if the referendum were rejected. Despite opposition from Mario Frick, a former Liechtenstein prime minister, the Prince's referendum was approved by the electorate in 2003. Opponents accused Hans-Adam of engaging in emotional blackmail to achieve his goal and constitutional experts from the Council of Europe branded the event as a retrograde move. A proposal to revoke the Prince's new veto powers was rejected by 76% of voters in a 2012 referendum. On 15 August 2004 Prince Hans-Adam II formally delegated most of his sovereign authority to his son and heir, the Hereditary Prince Alois, as a way of transitioning to a new generation. Formally, Hans-Adam remains head of state.\n\nAccording to their house law, the monarch bears the titles: \n\n\n"}

After the fall of France, it continued broadcasting a domestic-only program.\n\nParis-Mondial first broadcast in 1937, targeting an international audience with multilingual programming. Its sign-on for its U.S.-directed broadcasts was \"Hello, America!\". A 1938 survey of French embassies reported that Paris-Mondial enjoyed a clear signal in North America, though reception in Africa and the Caribbean was spotty.\n\nFollowing the invasion of France in 1940, Paris-Mondial eliminated all non-English programming and began a non-stop schedule of broadcasts that included, ultimately fruitless, appeals for help by Frenchmen who had lived or worked in the United States.\n\nOn June 9, 1940, the staff of Paris-Mondial abandoned their facilities in Paris and evacuated to a series of backup facilities, first in Poitiers and, after that became untenable, to Bordeaux. As of June 12, the monitoring centers of the U.S. networks NBC and CBS reported the station was continuing to transmit its \"usual newscasts\" and could still be picked-up in New York City. However, this routine soon gave way to \"recordings of military marches and panicked appeals for guns, tanks, and planes\". On June 14 the station went off-air, returning on June 15 with the sign-on \"this is Paris-Mondial, broadcasting from somewhere in France\". Programming became increasingly intermittent during the final days of the French Third Republic. In its last hours, the station's broadcasts consisted almost exclusively of frantic talk-format programs \"begging for aid\".\n\nAfter the fall of France, Paris-Mondial was rebranded by the government of the État Français as \"the Voice of France\" and aired a mixture of original programming and rebroadcasts of German radio, all internally directed (under the terms of the French surrender, international broadcasting was prohibited). When broadcasting German programming, Voice of France operated under the name \"Y\".\n\nFrom 1937 to 1944, the artistic director of Paris-Mondial / Voice of France was Tony Aubin.\n\n"}

The service launched on 3 May 2012.\n\nThe RTÉ Network Limited (RTÉNL) analogue terrestrial television (ATT) network was never capable of providing 100% population coverage in Ireland. Prior to the digital switchover, ATT population coverage amounted to 98% for RTÉ One and RTÉ Two, 95% for TG4 and 85% for TV3. Saorview DTT faces a similar difficulty.\n\nBroadcasting the channels unencrypted from the Astra 2 satellites at 28° East was not considered an option due to its large footprint covering the UK, France and many other countries. Irish broadcasters acquire rights on the basis that programming is broadcast to Irish audiences (i.e. some 4.5 million people) and not to approx 100 million people within the Astra footprint. The Board of RTÉ approved the Saorsat approach developed by RTÉNL from early 2010 to enable the 1-2% of Irish households not covered by Saorview to access free-to-air digital television services.\n\nRTÉ submitted a revised DTT plan including the FTA satellite option to the Department of Communications in mid June 2010 for approval. RTÉ publicly announced at an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications discussion in mid July 2010 that a free-to-air satellite service, called Saorsat, would be offered to complement the terrestrial DTT service.\n\nThe satellite option is a narrow-band satellite operating in the Ka band as opposed to the normal DTH Ku band (which Sky and Freesat use), with a spot beam being dedicated exclusively to Ireland which will also provide coverage throughout Northern Ireland. The spot beam with frequency reuse means reception in most of Britain and continental Europe is not possible. RTÉ states that the chosen satellite option will cost approximately €1.5 million per year.\n\nRTÉ said the combined offering was designed to be the most cost-effective solution for viewers and broadcasters; to offer for the first time 100% coverage of free-to-air public service television services in the Republic of Ireland; and to provide full national back-up coverage on satellite in the event of an emergency or catastrophic failure of the DTT system.\n\nApproval for the revised National DTT plan and Saorsat satellite service was announced by the Minister for Communications at the end of July 2010.\n\nRTÉ did not confirm that Saorsat would broadcast from KA-SAT until February 2012. There is no other current satellite solution with a spot covering only Ireland. Strictly speaking the spot covers a large part of Wales, South West England and the Hebrides of Scotland, but the frequency and polarisation reuse scheme means that no matter how big a dish is used, interference from a similar spot over northern France would prevent reception much beyond terrestrial overspill into Wales. Reception over all of Northern Ireland may be possible.\n\nAt least a Ka band LNB, dish and DVB-S2 receiver will be required to receive Saorsat. Reception of Sky or Freesat from the Astra 2 satellites at 28° East will require a separate feed and a DiSEqC or Multiswitch with a Diseqc compatible receiver. 2rn state that a dish of 1m diameter is required for reception of Saorsat on the island of Ireland.\n\nSaorview is really the RTÉ NL name for the public service broadcaster multiplexes. According to the RTÉ submission to Oireachtas committee the proposed RTÉ NL operated Saorsat is expected to be a copy of Saorview. the test loop used the same total bitrate as the terrestrial DTT mux. A dual feed dish (with Ku and Ka LNBFs) or a separate second boxed Cassegrain \"dish\" is required with a Diseqc switch and HD DVB-S2 tuner to have Freesat and Saorsat on the same set-box or IDTV receiver.\n\nRTÉ has made it clear that Saorview/Saorsat will not carry television services from outside the Republic of Ireland and that people in Ireland should seek other digital services to view additional channels other than what is offered. In contrast, the Irish government has already signed an agreement to permit retransmission of BBC channels.\n\nTesting started in May 2011 on KA-SAT 9E, 20.185 GHz DVB-S2 SR25000 FEC 1/2 with pre-recorded material.\n\nParameters are:\n\n\nIt's likely a second carrier will be used to carry material on the second Terrestrial PSB mux. The second DTT mux is running with no services on many sites and there is a second DVB-S2 carrier in the same part of the Ku band for Internet Services using SR 50000 with adaptive modulation and FEC.\n\nAny DVB-S2 HD satellite receiver can in theory be used to receive Saorsat as the Ka band LNBF converts to a regular IF in the 950 MHz to 2,100 MHz band. If the receiver does not have a setting for the Ka band LNBF Lo, then a \"fake\" frequency 10.765 vertical rather than the real 20.185 may be entered when using the Inverto LNB with local oscillator of 21.2.\n\nTo receive Freesat/Sky or other services alongside Saorsat, a dual- or multi-feed type dish or two dishes are needed with either one or more DiSEqC switches or a multi-switch. On a multi-switch the Saorsat LNB needs to be connected to vertical 0 kHz port only. The other 3 input ports are left unused.\n\nEven with the narrow beam reception is available in the western parts of Scotland, England and Wales with an LNBF on an 80 cm dish pointed at Eutelsat 9E.\n\nVirgin Media One, Virgin Media Two and Virgin Media Three do not broadcast on Saorsat, but are available on Saorview. There is a range of channels for Saorview which are either offered from RTÉNL, or the BAI.\n\n\n"}

He joined the Ulster Bridge Repertory Company, run by the actor James Ellis, as a stage manager.\n\nMoving to Vancouver in pursuit of his first wife, Fern, in 1964, he joined KOL Seattle Using the pseudonym Rick West working the midnight-to-6am shift \"broadcasting to a field of sleeping cows\" as he once described it.\n\nFrom there Vance moved to Los Angeles where he was offered a show by programming consultant Bill Drake on KHJ radio (aka Boss Radio), holding the evening airshift at KHJ for several months in late 1965. The programme had originally been intended for another presenter who had pulled out of the deal at the last moment, the jingles and pre-launch publicity could not go to waste so Rick West became \"Tommy Vance\", \"The station asked if I would take the name as they had already made the jingles for him. I said, for that kind of money you can call me what you like, mate.\"\n\nKHJ was one of the most successful and influential Top 40 stations of the era and California in 1965 was a great place to be. However, America was then involved in a war in Vietnam and when Tommy got his draft papers for the US Army, he decided it was time to head back to the UK.\n\nVance returned to the UK in 1965 just before Christmas with British musician Ian Whitcomb who lent him the fare. Tommy knocked on the door of Caroline House in London, no programme controller was going to pass up on the opportunity to employ a KHJ boss jock and Caroline's Bill Hearne was no exception.\nHe was hired by Radio Caroline South, where his colleagues included Johnnie Walker, Dave Lee Travis, Tony Blackburn and Emperor Rosko. On 3 January 1966 Vance presented his first show on Caroline South, his slogan was \"TV on radio\" and used Jack Costanzo's version of the \"Naked City Theme\" as his signature tune.\n\nIn 1966, Vance released a handful of singles, \"You Must Be the One\" a covers of Herman's Hermits', 'Silhouettes' and a cover of The Rolling Stones, \"Off the Hook\".\nVance’s Wife was not best pleased with the idea that her husband was going to be on a ship two weeks out of three and it would mean she would be living in an unfamiliar city on her own, So Vance left Caroline after a few months and moved to Radio Luxembourg. The marriage did not last so when Caroline's Ronan O'Rahilly suggested Tommy should return to the ship there was nothing to stop him, and he rejoined in December 1966.\n\nDuring the summer of 1967 it became apparent that the government was going to legislate against the offshore stations. Tommy heard a rumour that Philip Birch, boss of Wonderful Radio London, was negotiating to move his station to France and he wanted to be a part of it. In July 1967 he transferred to Radio London. Unfortunately Big L failed to find a base on the continent. Rather than break the new law, it chose to close down on 14 August so Tommy's stay with the station was brief.\n\nAfter the pirates were closed down in 1967, the BBC's new station, BBC Radio 1, adopted much of their musical philosophy and took on many of their personnel including Caroline colleagues John Peel, Tony Blackburn and Johnnie Walker. Vance co-hosted the \"progressive\" show \"Top Gear\" with John Peel. When the programme was given to Peel to present solo, Vance presented the popular weekly programme \"Pop Club\" on the BBC World Service. Each instalment of the programme started with Cliff Richard. Members of the \"Pop Club\" got special badges and membership cards.\n\nFrustrated with his lack of progress, however, Vance joined Radio Monte Carlo International with Dave Cash and Kenny Everett. In October 1973 all three would join the new London-based Capital Radio, Britain's first legal commercial pop station, initially co-presenting the morning show with Joan Shenton and then playing reggae and soul music on a weekend show. \n\nIn 1975 Vance made a film appearance as disc jockey, Ricky Storm, in Richard Loncraine's Slade in Flame, a vehicle for the group Slade. By 1976, Vance was also on the Portsmouth ILR station Radio Victory. \n\nVance hosted Capital's first reggae show and, at a time when punk was being shunned by the press, he carried out the first in-depth interview with Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols in 1977, in which Rotten talked at length about his love of reggae music, at a time when the group were given very little media exposure elsewhere.\n\nVance returned to Radio 1 in November 1978 to begin a 15-year stint hosting the show for which he is best remembered — the \"Friday Rock Show\". He was to become associated with heavy metal and rock music; his deep, resonant, booming voice and catch-phrase 'classic cuts' have been much imitated. The first record which he played on the show, and with which he finished on his final programme in 1993, was 'Rock 'n' Roll Damnation' by AC/DC. A 1983 edition was the first radio programme to use only compact discs. His signature music was \"Take It Off the Top\" by Dixie Dreggs and then he would say in his gravelly voice, \"Hi, this is TV on the radio and welcome to the programme that we call the Friday Rock Show.\" \n\nVance had a two-year stint (10 January 1982 to 1 January 1984) hosting the Sunday-afternoon Top 40, where he showed knowledge of and enthusiasm for a wide range of music and displayed a similar keenness when he hosted \"Top of the Pops\" around the same time. He also deputised on the Top 40 for Richard Skinner (in 1984 and 1985), Bruno Brookes (in 1987) and Mark Goodier (in 1991 and 1992).\n\nVance was a daily presenter on BFBS from 1976 to 1987 and so he also became known in Germany, where BFBS was popular among a civilian audience despite being aimed officially at British military personnel. He also presented a weekly chart show for BFBS as well as other programmes such as \"Soul Bowl\". As well as presenting the best-selling singles chart of 1982 and 1983, he also presented the equivalent show in 1991 despite not presenting the weekly chart at the time. \n\nIn 1984 to 1985, Tommy Vance hosted a Thursday night AOR programme on Radio 1, \"Into the Music.\" This was in place for about a year before being taken off in favour of Andy Kershaw. At a similar time, the \"Friday Rock Show\" gained an extra hour on MW only, during which the rock charts were played.\n\nWhen the BBC's new radio station for London, Greater London Radio (GLR), was launched in 1988, Vance presented the drivetime show, mixing album-oriented rock and current affairs dubbed \"rock and rolling news\". He also became the continuity announcer for BBC2 and interviewed for the BBC World Service.\nHe was a frequent choice as master of ceremonies at award shows, concerts and festivals; such as Monsters of Rock at Donington Park. \nVance departed Radio 1 in March 1993, however, he continued to host \"Rock Salad\" for BBC World Service for many years.\n\nTommy was a key player in the launch of Virgin Radio in March 1993, presenting the Drivetime show, a move he later regretted as the station dropped its adventurous format in favour of an ad-driven playlist.\n\nVance co-founded the internet radio station Rock Radio Network with his former Radio 1 producer Tony Wilson, music promoter Andy King and journalist Malcolm Dome in 1997, rebranding as TotalRock in 2000.\n\nVance developed business interests with the Silk Sound studios in Soho, later joined by The Bridge. He revived the Friday Rock Show for the digital channel VH1 which ran for some years until 2002. He featured twice in the Channel 4 comedy series, \"The 11 O'Clock Show\", the spot was called Tommy Vance's News Slam in which he took a minute to read out news headlines. He was presenter and voiceover for the Channel 5 series \"Dumber and Dumber\" and had a much quoted appearance on \"Brass Eye\". \n\nPerhaps his most memorable TV appearance came in 2004 when he walked out of ITV's \"Hell's Kitchen\". He decided to leave the show after escaping a scalding from boiling fat and foulmouthed abuse from the celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsey. Vance's agent stated that he felt the environment was \"dangerous\" and that he was a risk to himself and the other contestants due to his age.\n\nWhen Vance moved to Spain, it was with the intention of a gentle semi-retirement. It was not long before he was back on the air playing music for the tourists and ex-pats on the Costa del Sol's Spectrum FM. Vance came back to Britain and threw himself into work again, doing commercials, appearing on television and returning to Virgin to present a weekly show on their DAB and internet offshoot, Virgin Classic Rock.\n\nVance died at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent in the early hours of 6 March 2005, three days after suffering a stroke at his home. He said of death, \"When you're gone, you're gone, I don't want anybody weeping for me.\" Vance is survived by his ex-wife, their son and daughter.\n\nOn 11 March 2005, five days after Vance's death, TotalRock ran \"Rock On, Tommy Day\", a 15-hour live broadcast celebrating his life and work, including lots of music, numerous testimonials from artists and colleagues, and also from people who wrote down their thoughts on Tommy at a special Forum, \"In Memoriam: Tommy Vance\", put up at the TotalRock website. As a finale, after the actual live broadcast had ended, the last Friday Rock Show Vance recorded for BBC Radio 1 in 1993 was re-broadcast.\n\nOn 31 March 2006, a Tommy Vance Tribute Night, in association with the Teenage Cancer Trust foundation, was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Judas Priest, Scorpions and Ian Gillan all performed to pay tribute. There were also special stage appearances by Roger Daltrey and Bruce Dickinson.\n\nIn early 2018, it was announced that a new festival, Stonedeaf, would be naming their stage after Tommy Vance. In true Monsters of Rock fashion with one day and one stage, held at Newark Showground on the same weekend.\n\n"}
