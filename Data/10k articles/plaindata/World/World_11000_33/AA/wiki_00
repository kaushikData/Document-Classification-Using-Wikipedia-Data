UMEK started the label to promote tracks from talented artists, regardless of their fame and the strength of previous releases.\n\nThe label's creative concept is based on its sound as well as on its visual appearance.\n\nThe 1605 sound relies on UMEK's creative feeling as he acts as A&R manager and decides personally which tracks are signed by the label. Tracks are usually released digitally and sold online in various outlets such as Beatport, iTunes, Trackitdown, Juno and others. The only project, which was released also on a CD, was UMEK's 2010 album Responding to Dynamic.\n\n1605's music can also be heard on the label's podcast and on websites such as Soundcloud and Mixcloud.\n\nThe label is also building its recognition by using a distinctive graphic design for artwork (release covers, promo material).

They also form a regency of Maluku province, with a land area of . At the 2011 Census the Regency had a population of 84,138; the latest official estimate (as of January 2014) was 93,722.\n\nThe regency is divided into seven districts (\"kecamatan\"), tabulated below with their areas (in km) and their 2010 Census populations.\n\nThe islands are the easternmost in Maluku province, and are located in the Arafura Sea southwest of New Guinea and north of Australia. The total area of the islands is 8,152.42 km (3,147 sq mi). The largest island is Tanahbesar (also called Wokam); Dobo, the chief port of the islands, is on Wamar, just off Tanahbesar. Other main islands are Kola, Kobroor, Maikoor, and Trangan. The main islands rise to low hills, and are separated by meandering channels. Geologically, the group is part of the Australian continent, along with New Guinea, Tanimbar, Tasmania, Waigeo, and Raja Ampat on the Indo-Australian Plate.\n\nAru is covered by a mix of tropical moist broadleaf forests, savanna, and mangroves. The Islands lie on the Australia-New Guinea continental shelf, and were connected to Australia and New Guinea by land when sea levels were lower during the ice ages. The flora and fauna of Aru are part of the Australasia ecozone, and closely related to that of New Guinea. Aru is part, together with much of western New Guinea, of the Vogelkop-Aru lowland rain forests terrestrial ecoregion.\n\nAs part of the political and administrative decentralization of Indonesia since Suharto stepped down in 1998, the Aru Islands are now a separate residency (\"kabupaten\"), headquartered at Dobo, split off from the residency of Central Maluku.\n\nPearl farming provides a major source of income for the islands. The Aru pearl industry has been criticized in national media for allegedly maintaining exploitive debt structures that bind the local men who dive for pearls to outside boat owners and traders in an unequal relationship.\n\nOther export products include sago, coconuts, tobacco, mother of pearl, \"trepang\" (an edible sea cucumber, which is dried and cured), tortoiseshell, and bird-of-paradise plumes.\n\nIn November 2011, the Government of Indonesia awarded two oil-and-gas production-sharing contracts (PSC) about west of the Aru Islands to BP. The two adjacent offshore exploration PSCs, West Aru I and II, cover an area of about with water depths ranging from . BP plans to acquire seismic data over the two blocks.\n\nThe Aru Islands have a long history as a part of extensive trading networks throughout what is now eastern Indonesia. Precolonial links were especially strong to the Banda Islands, and Bugis and Makasarese traders also visited regularly.\n\nThe islands were sighted and also possibly visited by some Portuguese navigators, such as Martim Afonso de Melo, in 1522-24, who sighted the islands and wintered on a nearby island or of the Aru archipelago itself, and possibly by Gomes de Sequeira, in 1526, as is pointed out in the cartography of the time. The Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra sighted the islands on 12 June 1528, when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain.\n\nThe islands were colonized by the Dutch beginning 1623, though initially the Dutch East India Company was one of several trading groups in the area, with limited influence over the islands' internal affairs.\nIn 1857 the famous naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace visited the islands. His visit later made him realise, that the Aru islands must have been connected by a landbridge to mainland New Guinea during the ice age.\nIn the nineteenth century, Dobo, Aru's largest town, temporarily became an important regional trading center, serving as a meeting point for Dutch, Makasarese, Chinese, and other traders. The period from the 1880s to 1917 saw a backlash against this outside influence, by a spiritually-based movement among local residents to rid the islands of outsiders.\n\nThe islands had a population of 84,138 at the 2010 Census. Most indigenous islanders are of mixed Malay and Papuan descent. Fourteen languages - Barakai, Batuley, Dobel, Karey, Koba, Kola, Kompane, Lola, Lorang, Manombai, Mariri, East Tarangan, West Tarangan, and Ujir - are indigenous to Aru. They belong to the Central Malayo-Polynesian languages, and are related to the other languages of Maluku, Nusa Tenggara, and Timor. Ambonese Malay is also spoken on Wamar. All are members of the Austronesian language family.\n\nThe population is mostly Christian with a small Muslim minority. Figures cited by Glenn Dolcemascolo for 1993 were approximately 90% Protestant, 6% Catholic, and 4% Muslim. A more recent report from 2007 suggested that the 4% Muslim figure may only relate to the indigenous population and that the actual percentage of Muslims may be significantly higher. Islam is thought to have been introduced to the islands in the late 15th century. The Dutch brought Christianity in the 17th and 18th centuries but much of the conversion of the population to Christianity did not take place until the 20th century.\n\n"}

The organization is of NGO type.\n\nHeadquartered in Hilversum, GIP has regional centers in Tbilisi, Sofia, and Vilnius, and a country office in Dushanbe.\n\nGIP is a main contributor to improving psychiatric care in countries of the former Soviet Union as well as Central and Eastern Europe. It has expanded its focus and as of 2010 is including projects in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\nGIP also focuses on the political abuse of psychiatry throughout the world and human rights monitoring.\n\n20 December 1980 saw the formation in Paris of the International Association on the Political Use of Psychiatry (IAPUP) whose first secretary was Dr Gérard Bles of France. Since the Congress in Honolulu in 1978, he has inspired the movement against the use of psychiatry for political ends. The organization campaigned against the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union by leading efforts within national and international psychiatric organizations to eradicate this systematic abuse. The IAPUP had no connection with any political group nor with antipsychiatry. The organization brought together and coordinated independent groups dedicated to the struggle against political abuse of psychiatry and composed of psychiatrists and human rights activists from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and West Germany. During its first two decades IAPUP, investigated the accusations of oppressive exploitation in a number of countries such as Argentina, Bulgaria, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, Eastern Germany, Hungary, Romania, South Africa, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia. The publication of the IAPUP was \"Information Bulletin\". The IAPUP included the following participating committees:\n\nIn 1986, Robert van Voren became General Secretary of the IAPUP. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the financing of the IAPUP headed by Robert van Voren ceased until it adopted program of broad compromises and, correspondingly, the opposite name of The International Association for the Abolition and Prevention of Political Psychiatry, or Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry. In 2005, the organization was renamed Global Initiative on Psychiatry (GIP). From 1995 to 2000, Chair of the Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry was James Birley.\n\nThe board is composed of professionals from some twenty countries. Chief Executive of the Global Initiative on Psychiatry is Robert van Voren, a Honorary Fellow of the British Royal College of Psychiatrists and Honorary Member of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association. In 2005, he was knighted by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands for his work as a human rights activist. He is a professor of Soviet and post-Soviet Studies in the Ilia State University in Tbilisi (Georgia) and in the Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas (Lithuania).\n\nThe Global Initiative on Psychiatry uses a local approach to helping the mentally ill in underprivileged countries around the world. In Robert van Voren's words, their idea is that \"mental health services should be locally empowered, locally adapted, community based, user oriented, and focused on keeping people with mental illness in society, instead of taking them out.\" The organization has been involved in deinstitutionalizing mental health services for children in post-Communist countries. The GIP dedicates itself to promoting the necessary reforms to implement \"humane, ethical, and effective mental health care throughout the world.\" Reports by the Global Initiative on Psychiatry are often comprehensive and consider the treatment options. The organization has campaigned with substantial success against poor mental health practices abroad, especially in China and the former communist states. Robert van Voren's contribution to reform of forensic psychiatry in states of the former Soviet Union is widely recognized.\n\n"}

Its director is doc. Ing. Mgr. Petr Kratochvil, Ph.D., important elements of self-government organizational structures are also IIR Board and the Supervisory Board.\n\nIIR's predecessor was the Institute for International Politics and Economics (IIPE), founded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1957.\n\nIIPE was canceled at the beginning of the normalization period in 1970 because of the activities of employees during the Prague Spring. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the Institute of International Relations underwent radical changes. In 2007, the IIR transformed into a public research institution, since when it had been funded through grants and foundations.\n\nSince 1970 it has been located in 3 Neruda Street in Prague. The public can also visit the historic building and use the services of specialized libraries, study halls and attend organized events.\n\nIn 1957, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs established the Institute of International Politics and Economics (IIPE). In the course of the 1960s, a number of the Institute’s researchers took part in the reform process which peaked during the Prague Spring of 1968. As a result, the IIPE was reorganized and on 1 March 1970 turned into the Institute of International Relations (IIR) which employed some of the IIPE’s employees.\n\nThe following period of the so-called normalization was characterized, especially in its first years, by strong ideological influence on the Institute’s activities. Nevertheless, the Institute continued maintaining relations with foreign institutions, including the capitalist countries. Its library also played an important role, as its funds comprised resources which were nowhere else to be found in the then Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe fall of communism meant important personnel as well as organizational changes also for the Institute of International Relations. In 1993, the scholarly quarterly journal Mezinarodni vztahy, which had been issued already since 1966, was joined by the Perspectives bi-annual published in English. The portfolio of periodicals was also gradually supplemented by the popular Mezinarodni politika monthly, issued – albeit with a 20 year interruption – already since 1957. The IIR also grew bigger, as it acquired two new autonomous units – the Diplomatic Academy (which became a separate body within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 1 January 2007) and the Development Centre.\n\nIn the year of the 50th anniversary of the Institute - 2007 - the IIR underwent a transformation and turned into an independent public research institution. There was also a change in funding, which has become much more dependent on the results of the Institute's staff: the Institute is supported through a grant scheme for projects in the field of foreign policy by foreign and domestic entities ( e.g. the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic ) and various foundations ( e.g. the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation or the American PEW Charitable Trust ). These funds allow the implementation of the research activities of the Institute, also offering scholarships to support young scientists either through permanent research projects, or in the form of various internships.\n\nAt present, the Institute of International Relations ranks among the leading institutions in the field of international relations in the Czech Republic and in the European context, for example according to an independent evaluation of the University of Pennsylvania. It was established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, workers of the IIR abiding by the Code of Ethics and internal rules do not hold one particular opinion or political current. Topics dealt with are free to be chosen and there is an internal or external way of evaluating scientific value and contribution to the field.\n\nInstitute was located in the Lobkowicz Palace from 1957 to 1970, then it was moved into the building in 3 Neruda Street in Prague in Malá Strana.\n\nIn its activities, the IIR follows four basic goals:\n\nThe main activity of the Institute is the research carried out by researchers of international relations department. IIR performs basic and applied research, the main concern is the field of European integration with a specific focus on the interests and actions of the Czech Republic in the European Union, international security, with emphasis on the role of the Czech Republic in international security relations, not least in the area of development of selected strategic regions.

It believes that transnational citizen action is vital because \"global markets and multinational corporations so comprehensively overpower individual nations that no politician dares make the first move to solve global problems for fear of competitive disadvantage\".\n\nISPO aims to overcomes this paralysis by bringing all nations to adopt in principle - and then to simultaneously implement - the Simultaneous Policy (Simpol), a range of democratically formulated regulations to bring about economic justice, environmental security and peace around the world.\n\nBy supporting Simpol, ISPO's citizen-members pledge to vote in future elections for ANY political party or candidate - within reason - that has signed a pledge to implement Simpol's range of measures only when all or sufficient other governments have also signed. ISPO argues that, as more and more citizens act in this way, politicians will have no choice but to sign the Pledge if they wish to remain in office, or else they risk losing their seats to other politicians who have adopted it. One of its slogans is \"Use Your Vote to Take Back the World!\"\n\nSimultaneous policy requires governments in all jurisdictions at once, worldwide, to implement a policy shift at once, so that none is disadvantaged or unfairly advantaged.\n\nThe idea of the need for simultaneity of sovereign state action is not itself a new idea - it is the basis of treaty and United Nations initiatives that nothing can be done on certain problems, such as disarmament, until all major players agree to a common timetable of implementing solutions.\n\nHowever, according to the process offered by ISPO, what appears to be new is that citizens who \"adopt\" the Simultaneous Policy (Simpol) take the formulation of global policy into their own hands. Furthermore, according to ISPO, their adoption of Simpol represents their pledge to vote in future elections, not for a \"particular\" politician or political party, but for ANY politician or party - within reason - that pledges to implement Simpol's package of policies alongside other governments. With more and more parliamentary seats and even entire elections increasingly being won or lost on very small margins, a relatively small number of Simpol adopters have the opportunity, ISPO claims, to make it in the strong interests of all politicians and parties to pledge to implement Simpol's policy package while also making it potentially disastrous for them if they fail to do so. As such, ISPO claims that civil society, through its adoption of Simpol, can for the first time lead governments, rather than governments leading the people.\n\nThe International Labour Organization and GlobalGreens both recommend certain simultaneous policy initiatives, and closer coordination of their members in many nations. Such cooperation is seen as a way to work within a competitive global market economy without disadvantaging the most 'progressive' players who strongly protect ecology and the worker.\n\nSimultaneous initiatives are seen as a way to avoid Prisoner's dilemma type problems, wherein there is a strong reward for defecting, and a risk for going along with a proposed plan if there is even one defector.\n\nAnother example problem of this nature is agricultural subsidies to domestic farmers. A nation abolishing such subsidies stands to lose much of its family farm infrastructure to cheap imports unless a simultaneous initiative in another country, or in tax, tariff and trade to make up for lost subsidies, takes place. As this example suggests, the policies that are put in place simultaneously may be more complex than initially realized, and may require the cooperation of multiple branches or levels of government within one country, in addition to global cooperation.\n\nIndividuals and politicians who have adopted ISPO's simultaneous policy have come from all parts of the political spectrum.\n\n\"SP provides a global regulatory and governance framework within which global free markets can operate freely, fairly, and within sustainable environmental limits.\" John Bunzl.\n\nThe Simultaneous Policy presently has campaigns running in twenty seven countries:\n\nAustralia,\nAustria,\nBangladesh,\nBelgium,\nBrazil,\nCameroon,\nCanada,\nDenmark,\nEast Africa region,\nGermany,\nHungary,\nIceland,\nIndia,\nIreland,\nItaly,\nLuxembourg,\nMali,\nMalta,\nNepal,\nNew Zealand,\nNigeria,\nPakistan,\nSpain,\nSweden,\nSwitzerland,\nUnited Kingdom and\nUruguay\n\nAs the United Kingdom was first to campaign it has more politicians who have signed the pledge. These politicians come from across the political spectrum:\n\n\nIndividuals who have signed but are no longer MPs are: Conservative Party: Sir Richard Body; Labour: Celia Barlow, Tony Benn; Liberal Democrat: Lembit Öpik<br>\n<br>In addition, there exists a growing number of Simpol partner organisations that support the democratic aims and principles of the Simultaneous Policy. These include the Canadian Action Party and the Global Justice Movement.\n\nThe Australian Federal Election of October 2004 saw 59 candidates pledge their support for Simpol.\n\nIn the UK 200+ candidates for the elections of 2010 pledged to implement the Simultaneous Policy, of whom 24 were elected as MPs. Former President of East Timor José Ramos-Horta has pledged his support for the policy.\n\n\n"}

The names of the princes were first recorded in Cosmas chronicle and then transmitted into most of the historical books of the 19th century including František Palacký's \"The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia\".\n\nOne theory about the number of the princes is propped on the frescoes on the walls of the Rotunda in Znojmo, Moravia but Anežka Merhautová claimed that the frescoes depict all the members of the Přemyslid dynasty including the Moravian junior princes.\n\nKřesomysl's name is thought to be derived from the old Slavonic words \"křesat\" meaning \"to strike a light\" and \"mysl\" meaning \"mind\" or \"spirit\" thus literally the name should have meant \"lighting the mind\". The suffix \"-mysl\" is also in the other mythical names Přemysl and Nezamysl. Záviš Kalandra thought the names of the seven princes were cryptic names of ancient Slavonic days of the week - Křesomysl being the fifth - Thursday, in Latin \"Iovis Dies\" whereas Jupiter and Thor were both gods of thunder the word \"křesat\" is explained here as \"to strike the lightnings\". Another theory says that the names were mistaken from a coherent and partly interrupted old Slavonic text.\n"}

It resulted in the Treaty of London of May 11, 1867. The immediate occasion of the conference was the necessity of settling the status of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, which, after the downfall of the First Napoleon, had been added to the dominions of the King of the Netherlands as a separate and independent state and made a member of the German Confederation. Notwithstanding the dissolution of the confederation, Luxemburg continued to be occupied by Prussian troops, the French government insisting upon the removal of these troops and threatening war to enforce the demand. \n\nThe conference was called to avert the new danger to the peace of Europe, and it solved the problem by the statesmanlike device of placing the Grand Duchy under the collective guarantee of the Great Powers as a permanently neutralized territory. The conference is notable for its clear recognition of the principle of neutralization and of the rights of a neutralized state, as well as the obligations incurred by the Powers joining in the collective guarantee. \n\nIn an individual guarantee, such as that guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium, powers which signed the treaty would be bound to individually defend a nation's neutrality regardless of the actions of the other signatories. In a collective guarantee, such as this treaty with Luxemburg, the major signatories would act in concert or would not be required to act at all. The distinction between individual and collective guarantee resulted in some confusion when the Germans invaded both Belgium and Luxemburg in August 1914. Since Germany inherited Prussia's 1867 commitment to a collective guarantee, by invading Luxemburg it rendered impossible any joint action in defense of Luxemburg's neutrality. Britain was therefore not required to intervene to defend Luxemburg. However, since Belgium was individually guaranteed by the major powers (including Britain), the British government felt obliged to defend its neutrality against German invasion.\n"}

The service would have been an advertisement-supported digital audio service with an emphasis on serving music genres that had lost exposure in the terrestrial radio market during that period, such as classic jazz, \"beautiful music,\" \"pop standards,\" and swing music. Two dedicated public radio talk channels were also proposed along with traditional talk radio channels.\n\n1990: Sirius Satellite Radio, known then as Satellite CD Radio, Inc., proposes the concept of a satellite-delivered digital radio service to the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n1991: New Jersey radio station WPAT switches formats on both its AM and FM stations from \"beautiful music\" to \"adult contemporary\" removing a high-fidelity FM radio outlet for these formats in the New York metropolitan area.\n\n1993: Popular music radio station WNEW in New York changes format from pop standards and swing music to business talk radio WBBR-AM. WQXR changes call letters to WQEW and format to pop standards and unsuccessfully attempts to capture the WNEW and WPAT listener diaspora.\n\n1995 January: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) sets aside 50 MHz (2310 MHz through 2360 MHz) in the S-band for Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service, also known as SDARS and now commonly known as Satellite Radio.\n\n1996: WPAT-FM switches from music to Spanish language \"adult contemporary\" format. Sister AM station WPAT switches to Mexican music format, then to Korean language, and eventually paid ethnic programming.\n\n1996: Clifford Burnstein, resident of New York and a partner in entertainment industry company Q-Prime, along with Peter Mensch bids $68 million for an SDARS license through holding company Primosphere Limited Partnership with the stated intention of restoring music genres no longer available in major radio markets.\n\n1997 April: American Mobile Satellite Corporation and Satellite CD Radio, Inc. are each awarded SDARS licenses. The companies eventually become known XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio, respectively. Primosphere and Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corporation are denied licenses by becoming third and fourth lowest bidders, respectively, during the auction.\n\n1997 October 27: The FCC formally dismisses Primosphere's and Digital Satellite Broadcasting Corporation's applications for an SDARS license.\n\n1997 November: Primosphere petitions the FCC to adopt foreign ownership restrictions for SDARS licensees in order to overturn both Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio's licenses. XM at the time had a 20% stake owned by foreign-owned WorldSpace Satellite Radio. \n\n1999 July: American Mobile Satellite buys the 20% share of XM Satellite Radio owned by the foreign-owned WorldSpace, effectively removing foreign ownership issues.\n\n2001 March: Primosphere petitions the United States Court of Appeals to require the FCC to review its previous petition to require the FCC to adopt foreign ownership restrictions on SDARS licensees, now including just Sirius Satellite Radio.\n\n2001 September 25: XM Satellite Radio officially launches.\n\n2001 December: The company petitioned the FCC to reconsider its 1997 decision to dismiss the company's SDARS application. The FCC reaffirmed its decision and sealed the company's fate.\n\n2002 July 1: Sirius Satellite Radio officially launches after several technical and financial delays.\n\n2007 August 27: Primosphere files second comment concerning the merger of Sirius and XM Satellite Radio.\n\nPrimosphere continued petitioning through 2004, when the company \"submitted a motion to withdraw the Application for Review\". But in February 2007, after the Sirius-XM merger announcement, \"Primosphere decided to withdraw its withdrawal\" because the FCC had not acted. The FCC had promised to \"re-auction the [SDARS] license among the other existing applicants\" if for any reason one of the other companies lost its license. Primosphere considered itself to be an applicant and requested half the S-band spectrum if the merger was approved. The company had already paid for launch fees for satellites, which would then be put in orbit, and Primosphere expected to have its service ready in five years, or sooner if Sirius-XM were to lease equipment for sending out their signals. In its FCC filing, Primosphere said, \"A better way to avoid the anticompetitive effects of the proposed XM/Sirius merger would be to have a new competitor in the SDARS who could begin operating immediately.\"\n\nBurnstein and Mensch told \"Radio & Records\" that they wanted the FCC to act as originally planned: making sure the two license holders were separate. Burnstein believed the FCC was \"uncomfortable with a single provider.\" He also pointed out that each of the four applicants paid $70,000, and Primosphere never had its deposit returned.\n\nBurnstein said studios could be finished in six months. Primosphere would offer about 30 music channels, with advertising. The objective was \"to serve the underserved.\"\n\n2009: Sirius/XM is required to lease 8% or 4 channels each to qualified groups as a condition of their merger. This could open the door to Primophere leasing channels on XM and on Sirius existing radios for free to consumers (supported by commercials).\n\n"}
