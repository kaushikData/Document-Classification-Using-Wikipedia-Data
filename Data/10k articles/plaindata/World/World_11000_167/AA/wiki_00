{"id": "3701724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3701724", "title": "Globalization of wine", "text": "Globalization of wine\n\nGlobalization of wine is the expansion of wine varietals and brands across nations and to other continents, especially in modern times as a result of the advent of air travel and access to wine information via the internet.\n\nWine has been traded internationally since ancient times. In the wake of the amphoras came professional winemakers, winemaking techniques, and cuttings of grapevines. Many grapes that are considered 'traditional' in Western Europe were in fact brought by ancient trade routes from the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea region. The Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Armenians all brought grapes to new homes.\n\nThere was a second wave of migration to the New World, under the European empires of the 16th–19th centuries – by the early 18th century South Africa was exporting Constantia to Europe, made with muscat grapes that originated in Egypt. Subsequent immigrants have brought their native wines and grapes wherever they have gone – the Italian influence on Argentine and Californian winemaking is particularly noteworthy. Wines from Portugal and Madeira were fortified to survive journeys across the world, and left their mark on wines in the colonies that aped their style and were named after them.\n\nThe phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century also had a big influence, destroying traditional field blends of indigenous grapes in vineyards, which were often replaced by monocultures of fashionable grapes such as the Bordeaux varieties – grafted, of course, onto rootstocks from North America. Vignerons faced a stark choice, either adopt the new techniques, or choose another profession. Phylloxera was the stimulus for the development of a new infrastructure of government breeding programmes and exchange of plant material and techniques.\n\nAfter the Second World War, a number of countries developed bland wines for the export market, with an emphasis on uniformity and branding, such as Mateus Rose and Blue Nun. These were welcomed by a mass market – and the multiple retailers who served them – and those same factors have helped similar brands to gain more power, although changes in fashion mean that the names have changed. The modern equivalents come from industrial irrigated vineyards in the New World, in regions such as Murray Darling in southern Australia and Worcester in South Africa. Such moves reflect changes in the general scale of food production in industrialised countries.\n\nAnother aspect of this is the rise of varietal labelling, which has made the big companies less tolerant of blends of obscure grapes, instead preferring to market 'big name' varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir, Syrah (Shiraz), Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc and Riesling.\n\nAnother growing trend has been the practice of the blending of bulk wine from other countries with local wine. In some cases, a wine marketed as a local product may be sourced entirely from elsewhere. Regulations on this practice vary widely, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nThe Judgment of Paris in 1976 and subsequent wine competitions helped winemakers throughout the New World realize that they could make wines equal to the very best produced anywhere in the world as well educating some markets about the potential of wine outside Europe. This process was much easier in some countries like England, with little indigenous production and a centuries-old tradition of importing wine from around the world, than it was in other countries. Further competitions brought to international attention other great wines from around the world, some of which like Penfolds Grange had already been made for decades.\n\nA major influence has been the wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. among consumers in the United States. His approval can make a massive difference to sales of a wine in the United States, and some winemakers in some parts of the world have been accused of chasing this market by changing their wines to suit his personal taste. This effect is the main subject of the documentary film \"Mondovino\". His points system is influential, particularly among retailers as a substitute for staff training.\n\nOn the other hand, as New World winemaking has matured, winemakers have taken more notice of \"terroir\", and matching grapes and winemaking styles to particular locations. Thus New World styles are starting to develop, such as Clare Valley Riesling, Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, and 'indigenous' varieties such as Pinotage are being proudly marketed as single-varietal wines rather than blended.\n\nIn Europe, there is renewed interest in heritage wines, particularly by the new democracies in Eastern Europe where wine can be a statement of national identity. A particularly good example is seen in Eger in Hungary, where the local Bull's Blood wine has seen a steady infusion of foreign grapes such as Blaufränkisch in the 18th century, the Bordeaux varieties after \"phylloxera\" struck, and Zweigelt under communism. This is now being reversed with substantial new planting of the traditional Kadarka variety.\n\nWine grapes grow almost exclusively between thirty and fifty degrees north or south of the equator. The world's southernmost vineyards are in the Central Otago region of New Zealand's South Island near the 45th parallel south, and the northernmost are in Flen, Sweden, just north of the 59th parallel north.\n\n\n"}

Nevertheless, all United Nations member-states have agreed to accept any final agreement resulting from negotiations between the two countries.

As of August 2011 negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute are ongoing.

Truman's statement on 27 June 1950, regarding the Korean War, which had broken out two days earlier. In his statement, Truman said that it would be a direct threat to the United States' security in the western Pacific area if the communist forces occupied Taiwan, so he ordered the 7th Fleet to enter the Taiwan Strait to prevent any attack on the island. Truman stated: \"The determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.\" Because of the statement, the Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan came into existence.\n\nAlthough Japan concluded the Treaty of San Francisco with the Allied Powers after World War II in 1951, in the treaty it merely \"renounced\" all right, title and claim to Taiwan and the Pescadores without explicitly stating the sovereignty status of the two territories. Therefore, the Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan is still supported by some politicians and jurists to this day.\n\nSupporters of the theory include, but are not limited to, supporters of the Taiwan independence movement. They believe that Taiwan's status should be determined by Taiwanese people through self-determination.\n\n"}
