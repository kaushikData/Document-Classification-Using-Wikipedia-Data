{"id": "3546056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3546056", "title": "Communal oven", "text": "Communal oven\n\nThe four banal (English: common oven) was a feudal institution in medieval France. The feudal lord (French: \"seigneur\") often had, among other banal rights, the duty to provide and the privilege to own all large ovens within his fief, each operated by an ovenmaster or \"fournier\". In exchange, personal ovens were generally outlawed and commoners were thus compelled to use the seigniorial oven to bake their bread. Such use was subject to payment, in kind or money, originally intended merely to cover the costs associated to the construction, maintenance and operation of the oven. Seigniorial ovens were masonry ovens built on the Roman plan and were large enough to hold an entire community's ration of bread.\n\nFor example, in the hamlet of Nan-sous-Thil (Côte-d'Or, France), the villagers were required to bake their bread at the \"four banal\", as at home they were permitted only a small oven placed under the hood of the chimneypiece, for baking \"gâteau et flan\". Those regulations sought to reduce the risk of fire where thatched cottages huddled together. The danger was real, as demonstrated in 1848 when a full quarter of the neighbouring hamlet of Thil-la-Ville was consumed by a fire that ignited from sparks when a housewife heated her oven.\n\nThe oven design, but not necessarily the feudal monopoly on oven operation, was carried to French colonies. In New France, it was the only banal right commonly established and the oven's fortified construction also served to protect the colonists during skirmishes.\n\nThe \"four banal\" system seems to have died out in France during the 18th century, though it was a time when some dormant seigneurial rights were being insisted upon by an aristocracy hard-pressed for cash, as an official \"mémoire\" suggests: \n\nTraditions surrounding the \"four banal\" may have lasted as late as World War II. In some rural areas of France, the old communal ovens are still extant (\"illustration\") and are sometimes used for community celebrations.\n"}
{"id": "3369160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3369160", "title": "Confidence-building measures", "text": "Confidence-building measures\n\nConfidence-building measures (CBMs) or confidence- and security-building measures are in actions taken to reduce fear of attack by both (or more) parties in a situation of tension with or without physical conflict. The term is most often used in the context of international politics, but is similar in logic to that of trust and interpersonal communication used to reduce conflictual situations among human individuals. CBMs emerged from attempts by the Cold War superpowers and their military alliances (the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the Warsaw Pact) to avoid nuclear war by accident or miscalculation. However, CBMs also exist at other levels of conflict situations, and in different regions of the world although they might not have been called CBMs.\n\nMathematically, this term assumes that a positive feedback model, where fear (and/or suspicion) of military attack or human rights violations is the positive feedback factor, is a valid model of the conflict. The actions which constitute confidence-building measures provide a negative feedback to the conflict, which weakens, or possibly cancels or reverses the tension which would otherwise grow exponentially and eventually turn into a war.\n\nIn international relations, the way that confidence-building measures are intended to reduce fear and suspicion (the positive feedbacks) is to make the different states' (or opposition groups') behaviour more predictable.\n\nThis typically involves exchanging information and making it possible to verify this information, especially information regarding armed forces and military equipment.\n\n1. CBMs dealing with troop movements and exercises:\n\n2. CBMs dealing with exchanges of information.\nInformation may be exchanged, directly or through third parties, in the following categories:\n\n3. CBMs dealing with exchanges of personnel.\nThese personnel exchanges should be balanced in terms of numbers and duration, and could include:\n\n4. CBMs dealing with the assembly, collation, and dissemination of data.\n\n5. CBMs dealing with border tensions.\n\n6. CBMs dealing with actions which might be interpreted as provocative.\n\n7. CBMs dealing with communications.\n\n8. CBMs dealing with weapons.\n\n9. CBMs dealing with extra-military contacts\n\n10. CBMs dealing with training and education.\n\n11. CBMs and regional military systems.\n\n12. CBMs and functionalism.\nCertain functional areas of military-to-military cooperation should be assessed for their possible value as confidence-builders, even between adversary nations. These include: search and rescue (SAR) missions for aircraft and shipping; disaster relief; hurricane tracking; civic action; humanitarian projects.\n\n13. CBMs dealing with ways of expanding CBMs.\n\nConfidence-building measures between sovereign states have for many centuries also included the existence of and increased activities by embassies, which are state institutions geographically located inside the territory of other states, staffed by people expected to have extremely good interpersonal skills who can explain and resolve misunderstandings due to differences in language and culture which are incorrectly perceived as threatening, or encourage local knowledge of a foreign culture by funding artistic and cultural activities.\n\nA much more grassroots form of confidence building occurs directly between ordinary people of different states. Short visits by individual children or groups of children to another state, and longer visits (6–12 months) by secondary and tertiary students to another state, have widely been used in the European Union as one of the methods of decreasing the tensions which had earlier led to many centuries of inter-European wars, culminating in the first and second world wars.\n\nIf the feedback model assumed by the confidence-building measure mechanism is correct, then the rapidly developing improvement in communication between ordinary people by the internet should provide extremely robust, fast methods of information exchange and verification, as well as improved people-to-people contacts and general building of trust networks, reducing the intensity and frequency of wars. Evidence to date, however, suggests that the internet is as likely to inflame opinion and increase conflict (or at least tensions) as individuals are exposed to significantly different points of view.\n\nAn alternative analytic approach to understanding confidence building looks at broader process concepts rather than concentrating on specific measures. This approach finds its fullest expression in \"Confidence Building in the Arms Control Process: A Transformation View\" (James Macintosh (Ottawa, Canada: Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Arms Control and Disarmament Studies Number 2, 1996. JX 1974.M32 1996)).\n\n\"Confidence Building in the Arms Control Process: A Transformation View\" sees conventional understandings of confidence building as incomplete and focuses on why and how developing confidence-building arrangements can help to improve security relations. Confidence building, according to the transformation view, is a distinct activity undertaken by policy makers with the minimum intention of improving some aspects of a traditionally antagonistic security relationship through security policy coordination and cooperation. It entails the comprehensive process of exploring, negotiating, and then implementing tailored measures, including those that promote interaction, information exchange, and constraint. It also entails the development and use of both formal and informal practices and principles associated with the cooperative development of CBMs. When conditions are supportive, the confidence building process can \"facilitate, focus, synchronize, amplify, and generally structure the potential for a significant positive transformation in the security relations of participating states\". Thus, the confidence-building process involves more than simply the production of a confidence building agreement and definitely should not be confused with what specific CBMs do.\n\nThe serious pursuit of legitimate confidence-building arrangements, according to the transformation view, is an activity that is particularly well-suited to fostering positive changes in security thinking (transformation) when conditions are supportive. This is due to the activity's fundamentally cooperative character and the reinforcing nature of the confidence-building measures that comprise an arrangement. Confidence building, because of its basic character, is able to facilitate and structure the potential for change in security relationships when at least some states are dissatisfied with, and beginning to question, status quo security policies and approaches.\n\nA particularly important dimension of the transformation view is the proposition that the changes in security thinking facilitated by confidence building can become \"institutionalized as a collection of new rules and practices stipulating how participating states should cooperate and compete with each other in their security relationship\". This restructured relationship redefines expectations of normal behaviour among participating states. Without at least a modest transformation of basic security expectations flowing from its application, \"it is difficult to see how confidence building can improve basic security relations in meaningful ways\".\n\nConfidence building appears to offer considerable promise as a security management approach. However, this potential cannot be fully realized unless a policy-relevant and conceptually sound understanding of the confidence-building process and how it works animates application efforts. Relying on the traditional \"minimalist\" accounts of confidence building, with their tendency to reify the operational content of confidence-building measures as the essence of \"confidence building,\" is unlikely to provide much help. This latter approach does not speak to the conditions that should be in place for effective confidence building to occur and \"lacks a convincing account of why and how adopting these measures will improve security relations\". (Text drawn from the executive summary of \"Confidence Building in the Arms Control Process: A Transformation View\", with permission of the author and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.)\n\nThrough trial and error, service members have learned that COIN and stabilization operations require confidence-building measures. For the counterinsurgent, the first critical factor required to build trust is the ability to understand the context of the situation fully. Cultural differences in education systems, religion, symbols, or behavioral norms could impede communication and the development of trust. As such, the counterinsurgent must always be aware of societal and cultural areas of sensitivity. Overall, the ability to understand underlying assumptions, past experiences, and the limiting factors of context will help set the stage for building trust.\n\nThe second critical factor is that it will take time. The time required to build trust can range from a few weeks to six months or more. With focused effort and regular interaction, trust typically forms at around the two- to- three-month mark. If the parties share significant risk, such as high levels of enemy contact, a strong bond of trust can form in a matter of weeks. \n\nThe third critical factor is the use of confidence-building measures. Confidence-building measures are the activities that can bring conflicts closer to positive resolution through of promotion the belief that, in the future, each party will act in a mutually beneficial manner. In COIN operations, confidence-building measures generally fall into the following categories: a) Physical measures, b) Communication measures, and c) Relationship measures (See Figure Below).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "647483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647483", "title": "Duchy of the Archipelago", "text": "Duchy of the Archipelago\n\nThe Duchy of the Archipelago (, ), or also Duchy of Naxos (, ) or Duchy of the Aegean (, ), was a maritime state created by Venetian interests in the Cyclades archipelago in the Aegean Sea, in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, centered on the islands of Naxos and Paros. It included all the Cyclades (except Mykonos and Tinos). In 1537 it became a tributary of the Ottoman Empire, and was annexed by the Ottomans in 1579; however, Christian rule survived in islands such as Siphnos (conquered by the Ottomans in 1617) and Tinos (conquered only in 1714).\n\nThe Italian city states, especially the Republic of Genoa, Pisa, and the Republic of Venice, had been interested in the islands of the Aegean long before the Fourth Crusade. There were Italian trading colonies in Constantinople and Italian pirates frequently attacked settlements in the Aegean in the 12th century. After the collapse and partitioning of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, in which the Venetians played a major role, Venetian interests in the Aegean could be more thoroughly realized.\n\nThe Duchy of the Archipelago was created in 1207 by the Venetian nobleman Marco Sanudo, a participant in the Fourth Crusade and nephew of the former Doge Enrico Dandolo, who had led the Venetian fleet to Constantinople. This was an independent venture, without the consent of the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders. Sanudo was accompanied by Marino Dandolo and Andrea and Geremia Ghisi (as well as Filocalo Navigajoso, possibly). He arranged for the loan of eight galleys from the Venetian Arsenal, set anchor in the harbor of Potamides (now Pyrgaki, in the southwest of Naxos), and largely captured the island.\n\nThe Naxiotes continued to resist, however, and established a base inland, around the fortress of Apalyros/Apalire. The latter fell to Sanudo after a five or six weeks' siege, despite the assistance rendered to the Greeks by the Genoese, Venice's main competitors.\n\nWith the entire island occupied in 1210, Sanudo and his associates soon conquered Melos and the rest of the islands of the Cyclades, and he established himself as \"Duke of Naxia\", or \"Duke of the Archipelago\", with his headquarters on Naxos. Sanudo rebuilt a strong fortress and divided the island into 56 provinces, which he shared out as fiefs among the leaders of his men, most of whom were highly autonomous and apparently paid their own expenses. Navigaojso had been granted his island domain by Henry of Flanders and was technically vassal of the Latin Empire; Sanudo himself recognized the Latin Empire's authority rather than making the Duchy a vassal of Venice. The conqueror himself ruled for twenty years (1207–27). He held in his personal possession Paros, Antiparos, Milos, Sifnos, Kythnos, Ios, Amorgos, Kimolos, Sikinos, Syros, and Pholegandros.\n\nSanudo's fellow crusaders conquered lordships of their own, sometimes as vassals of Sanudo like Dandolo for Andros. Although they are often considered to have become Sanudo's vassals as well, the Ghisi brothers, who held Tinos, Mykonos, and the Northern Sporades (Skiathos, Skyros, Skopelos) never recognized the suzerainty of Sanudo. Instead, like him they were directly vassals of the Latin Emperors. Some families thought earlier to have settled at this time in the islands (Querini, Barozzi) were in fact established in the 14th century. Further south, Kythera (or \"Cerigo\"), held by Marco Venier, and Antikythera (or \"Cerigotto\"), held by Jacopo Viaro chose to become vassals of Venice.\n\nThe institution of European feudalism caused little disruption to the local islanders who were familiar with the rights of a landowner class under the Byzantine system of the \"pronoia\". The significant legal distinctions between the Byzantine \"pronoia\" and feudalism were of little immediate consequence to those who farmed the land or fished the waters in question. In most cases, the local population submitted relatively peacefully to the authority of their new Venetian lords. Sanudo and his successors prudently followed a conciliatory course with their Byzantine subjects, granting even fiefs to certain among them, in an effort to bind them to the dynasty.\n\nThe Venetians brought the Catholic Church with them, but, as they were a minority of habitually absentee landowners, most of the population remained Greek Orthodox. Marco Sanudo himself established a Latin archbishopric on Naxos, but in contrast to his successors, did not attempt to forcibly convert the Greek Orthodox majority. These moves consisted primarily in imposing restrictions on Orthodox clergy and the exclusion of Orthodox Christians from positions of authority.\n\nThe islands were of great importance in Venetian grand strategy, with their valuable trade routes to Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean, which the Venetians could now control; Aside from providing safe traveling routes to Venetian ships, the Venetians also exported to Venice corundum and marble, which they mined on Naxos. Certain Latin feudal rights survived in the island of Naxos and elsewhere until they were abrogated in 1720 by the Ottomans.\n\nThe \"Annals\" of the Latin Archipelago center on the family histories of Sanudo and Dandolo, Ghisi, Crispo and Sommaripa, Venier and Quirini, Barozzi and Gozzadini. Twenty-one dukes of the two dynasties ruled the Archipelago, successively as vassals of the Latin Emperors at Constantinople, of the Villehardouin dynasty of princes of Achaea, of the Angevins of the Kingdom of Naples (in 1278), and after 1418 of the Republic of Venice.\n\nIn 1248, the Duchy was nominally granted to William of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. Marco II Sanudo lost many of the islands, except Naxos and Paros, to the forces of the renewed Byzantine Empire under the admiral Licario in the late 13th century. The Byzantine revival was to prove short-lived though, as they relinquished control of their gains in 1310.\n\nIn 1317 the Catalan Company raided the remnants of the Duchy; in 1383, the Crispo family led an armed insurrection and overthrew Sanudo's heirs as Dukes of Archipelago. Under the Crispo dukes, social order and agriculture decayed, and piracy became dominant.\n\nBefore the last Latin Christian duke, Jacopo IV Crispo, was deposed in 1566 by Ottoman Sultan Selim II, he was already paying the Sultan tribute. The Sultan's appointed representative, the last Duke of Archipelago (1566–79) was a Portuguese Jew (\"Marrano\"), Joseph Nasi.\n\nLatin Christian rule was not entirely removed after that date: the Gozzadini family in Bologna survived as lords of Siphnos and other little islands in the Cyclades until 1617, and the island of Tenos remained Venetian until 1714. The last Venetian ports in Morea (the Peloponnese) were captured in 1718. Gaspar Graziani, a Dalmatian nobleman, was awarded the title of \"Duke of the Archipelago\" in 1616, but the island was again under direct Ottoman rule at the end of 1617; he was the last to hold the title.\n\nToday, Cyclades islands such as Syros and Tinos have some entirely Catholic villages and parishes, while many Greeks from the Cyclades have surnames with a distinctly Italo-Venetian origin e.g. Venieris, Ragousis, Dellaportas, Damigos etc.\n\n\n\"(interregnum)\"\n\"(interregnum)\"\n\n\n\n"}

They reside in Malava that is in the Kabras Division of Kakamega District, which is neighboured by the Isukha, Banyala, Tsotso, and the Tachoni. The exact origin of the Luhya people is currently disputed, but there are historians who believe that the group came from Central and West Africa and migrated to their present-day location by way of the so-called Great Bantu Migration. \n\nThe Kabras dialect called Lukabaras is similar to Tachoni. However, the Kabras have spread to other regions as a result of intermarriages and movement to seek greener pasture in formal employment. These people are described as adaptable, easily absorbing other culture's values and beliefs. This can be demonstrated in the way many Kabras practice the Christian and Muslim faiths. One notable cultural practice involves circumcision and pride-price required for marriage. \n\nKabrasi clans were named after the heads of the families. They include Avatali, Abawande, Abamutama, Basonje, Abakhusia, Bamachina, Abashu, Abamutsembi, Baluu, Batobo, Bachetsi, and Bamakangala. Along with 17 other Luhya subtribes, the Kabras constitute 14 percent of the Kenyan population, making the ethnic group the second largest in the country, next to the Kikuyu. \n\nBefore the colonial era, the Kabaras were under the rulership of Nabongo Mumia, the king of the Wanga. They were represented by an elder in his Council of Elders. The last known elder in the king's council was Soita Libukana Samaramarami. The Kabaras are said to have originally been Banyala.\n\nWhen Quaker missionaries came to Kenya in the early part of the twentieth century, they spread out to Kabaras from Kaimosi in Tiriki. During the British colonization, the Kabras - along with the Wanga tribe - collaborated with the colonialists. These tribes, especially the Bukusu, which waged strong resistance to the invaders, avoided the fate of most of the Luhya people, who lost their fertile lands to the British colonial rule.\n\nIn politics, one of the famous Kabras politician is Dr. Noah Mahalang'ang'a Wekesa, the former Kwanza MP and he as well served as Wildlife and Forestry minister under President Mwai Kibaki. Besides, another notable Kabras politician is LateSoita Shitanda, who represented Malava Constituency in parliament and served as a Housing Minister in President Mwai Kibaki's cabinet. He was instrumental in the revival of the Sugar Cane industry in Western Kenya, spearheading the establishment of West Kenya Sugar factory in Malava. Former Chief Justice, the Late Zacchaeus Chesoni, hailed from the Kabras sub tribe Bamachina clan close to Chimoi area near Webuye. \n\nKabras people are farmers, practicing livestock rearing and crop farming. The main cash crop is Sugarcane, which is harvested and taken to West Kenya Sugar Company as well as Mumias Sugar Company. \n\n"}

Their performances are a part of ceremonies such as births, funerals, and coronations of \"mwami\" (Kings). Drums (called karyenda) are sacred in Burundi, and represent the mwami, fertility and regeneration. The Royal Drummers use drums made from hollowed tree trunks covered with animal skins. In addition to the central drum, called \"Inkiranya\", there are \"Amashako\" drums which provide a continuous beat, and \"Ibishikiso\" drums, which follow the rhythm established by the Inkiranya.\n\nThe performance of the Royal Drummers has been the same for centuries, and their techniques and traditions are passed down from father to son. The members of the ensemble take turns playing the Inkiranya, dancing, resting, and playing the other drums, rotating throughout the show without interruptions. At the start of their performance, the drummers enter balancing the heavy drums on their heads and singing and playing. There are some extra members who carry ornamental spears and shields and lead the procession with their dance. They then perform a series of rhythms, some accompanied by song, and exit the stage the same way, carrying the drums on their heads and playing.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, the Drummers have toured the world. They have recorded at least three albums - \"Batimbo (Musiques Et Chants)\" in 1991,\"The Drummers of Burundi\" (1992, recorded 1987) \"Real World\" (retitled \"Live at Real World\" in 1993) and \"The Master Drummers of Burundi\" (1981 lp, 1994 cd).

They have influenced artists such as Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow, and inspired Thomas Brooman to organize the WOMAD festival in 1982, which shaped the burgeoning world music genre.\n\nThe Drummers were featured inn Werner Herzog's film \"Fitzcarraldo\", as the \"drumming of the bushmen\".\n\n"}
