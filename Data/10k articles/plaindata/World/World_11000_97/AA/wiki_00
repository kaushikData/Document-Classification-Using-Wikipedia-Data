{"id": "1151939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1151939", "title": "Codex Alimentarius", "text": "Codex Alimentarius\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations relating to foods, food production, and food safety.\n\nIts name is derived from the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus. Its texts are developed and maintained by the \"Codex Alimentarius\" Commission, a body that was established in early November 1961 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), was joined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 1962, and held its first session in Rome in October 1963. The Commission's main goals are to protect the health of consumers and ensure fair practices in the international food trade. The Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the World Trade Organization as an international reference point for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection.\n\nAs of 2012, there were 186 members of the Codex Alimentarius Commission: 186 member countries and one member organization, the European Union (EU). There were 215 Codex observers: 49 intergovernmental organizations, 150 non-governmental organizations, and 16 United Nations organizations.\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius covers all foods, whether processed, semi-processed or raw. In addition to standards for specific foods, the Codex Alimentarius contains general standards covering matters such as food labeling, food hygiene, food additives and pesticide residues, and procedures for assessing the safety of foods derived from modern biotechnology. It also contains guidelines for the management of official i.e. governmental import and export inspection and certification systems for foods.\n\nThe Codex Alimentarius is published in the six official languages of the United Nations: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian. Not all texts are available in all languages.\n\n\n\nThe controversy over the Codex Alimentarius relates to a perception that it is a mandatory standard for the safety of food, including vitamin and mineral supplements. Supporters of the Codex Alimentarius say that it is a voluntary reference standard for food and that there is no obligation on countries to adopt Codex standards as a member of either Codex or any other international trade organization. From the point of view of its opponents, however, one of the main causes of concern is that the Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the World Trade Organization as an international reference standard for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection. Proponents argue that the use of Codex Alimentarius during international disputes does not exclude the use of other references or scientific studies as evidence of food safety and consumer protection.\n\nIt is reported that in 1996 the German delegation put forward a proposal that no herb, vitamin or mineral should be sold for preventive or therapeutic reasons, and that supplements should be reclassified as drugs. The proposal was agreed, but protests halted its implementation. The 28th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission was subsequently held July 4–9, 2005. Among the many issues discussed were the \"Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements\", which were adopted during the meeting as new global safety guidelines: The guidelines state that \"people should...be encouraged to select a balanced diet from food before considering any vitamin and mineral supplement. In cases where the intake from the diet is insufficient or where consumers consider their diet requires supplementation, vitamin and mineral food supplements serve to supplement the daily diet.\" This text has been the subject of considerable controversy among proponents of dietary supplements. Many countries regulate such substances as therapeutic goods or pharmaceuticals or by some other category, without requiring them to be shown to be medically useful. The text does not seek to ban supplements, but subjects them to labeling and packaging requirements, sets criteria for the setting of maximum and minimum dosage levels, and requires that safety and efficacy are considered when determining ingredient sources. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) will implement these criteria with \"labelling to stop consumers overdosing on vitamin and mineral food supplements.\" The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) has said that the Guidelines call \"for labelling that contains information on maximum consumption levels of vitamin and mineral food supplements.\" The WHO has also said that the Guidelines \"ensure that consumers receive beneficial health effects from vitamins and minerals.\"\n\nIn 2004, similarities were noted between the EU's Food Supplements Directive and the Codex Alimentarius draft guidelines for vitamin and mineral supplements'. Additional controversy has been expressed by proponents of ecologically and socially sustainable agriculture and food systems, such as the Slow Food movement, although the Slow Food movement has become more closely aligned with the EU. In addition, the Manifesto on the Future of Food stated that \"bureaucracies like the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Codex Alimentarius have codified policies designed to serve the interests of global agribusiness above all others, while actively undermining the rights of farmers and consumers\".\n\n\n"}

However, analysis by Erik Seiffert in 2006 concluded that the age of the Jebel Qatrani Formation should be revised. His assessment of more recent evidence indicates an age for most of the formation of between 30.2 and 29.5 million years ago, placing it almost entirely in the Early Oligocene. Seiffert states that only the lowest 48 metres was laid down in the Eocene, but recent opinion holds the original hypothesis of a sediment straddling the Eocene-Oligocene boundary to be correct.\n\nMostly sandstones deposited by meandering rivers and seasonal lakes, the lower (Eocene) part of the formation represents a woodlanded ecosystem of which lots of petrified wood also remain. In contrast, the upper (Oligocene) layers present indication of much drier and cooler conditions, with savanna replacing the woodland for several million years before the climate turned wetter and warmer again and the forests regrew.\n\nThe fauna changes also notably during this time, which seems to be coincident with the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event recorded in Eurasia.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the Berlin Congress of the same year, the Treaty of Berlin was adopted, according to which the territories of the Bulgarian state, established as per the San Stefano treaty, were divided into three parts: the first part was the Principality of Bulgaria, which functioned independently but was nominally a vassal of the Ottoman Empire and was limited to Moesia and areas adjacent to the capital Sofia; the second part was to be an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire—Eastern Rumelia; the third and largest part—all of the Macedonia and Lozengrad—were restored to the Ottoman Empire while some outlands were assigned to Serbia and Romania. Those territories seized from Bulgaria after the Berlin Congress, including most of Macedonia, Thrace and others, had a majority ethnic Bulgarian population. On 6 September 1885, Eastern Rumelia became part of the Principality of Bulgaria after a bloodless unification, although the principality was a \"de facto\" independent nation but \"de jure\" vassal nation of the Ottoman Empire until 1908, when Bulgaria proclaimed its declaration of independence.\n\nThe 1908 declaration, which signified Bulgaria's break with the Ottoman rule, was actually the second liberation of Bulgaria. After the conquest of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018, the first liberation of Bulgaria led to the establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the aftermath of the Uprising of Asen and Peter against the Byzantine Empire in 1185.\n\n"}

{"id": "42067609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42067609", "title": "Optic Nerve (GCHQ)", "text": "Optic Nerve (GCHQ)\n\nOptic Nerve is a mass surveillance programme run by the British signals intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), with help from the US National Security Agency, that surreptitiously collects private webcam still images from users while they are using a Yahoo! webcam application. As an example of the scale, in one 6-month period, the programme is reported to have collected images from 1.8 million Yahoo! user accounts globally. The programme was first reported on in the media in February 2014, from documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, but dates back to a prototype started in 2008, and was still active in at least 2012.\n\nThe leaked documents describe the users under surveillance as \"unselected\", meaning that data was collected indiscriminately in bulk from users regardless of whether they were an intelligence target or not. The vast majority of affected users would have been completely innocent of any crime or suspicion of a crime. Optic Nerve as described in the documents collected one still image every 5 minutes per user, attempting to comply with human rights legislation. The images were collected in a searchable database, and used for experiments in facial recognition, to monitor known targets, and to discover new targets. The choice of Yahoo! for surveillance was taken because \"Yahoo webcam is known to be used by GCHQ targets\". Unlike the US NSA, the UK GCHQ is not required by law to minimize the collection from domestic citizens, so UK citizens could have been targeted on the same level as non-UK citizens.\n\nThe story was broken by \"The Guardian\" in February 2014, and is based on leaked documents dating to between 2008 and 2012. Yahoo! expressed outrage at the programme, when approached by \"The Guardian\", and subsequently called it \"a whole new level of violation of our users' privacy.\" A GCHQ spokesperson stated \"It is a long-standing policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters\".\n\nThough there were some limits to which photos security analysts were allowed to see, with bulk searches limited to metadata, security analysts were allowed to see \"webcam images associated with similar Yahoo identifiers to your known target\".\n\nOptic Nerve worked by collecting the information from GCHQ's large network of Internet cable taps, feeding into systems provided by the United States' National Security Agency. NSA research was used to build the tool to isolate the webcam traffic.\n\nGiven that both Yahoo! Messenger chats and webcam streams are sent unencrypted, it would have been relatively easy (though not trivial) to intercept the webcam traffic. Following the Snowden leaks, Yahoo! planned to give all users the option to encrypt all communications with Yahoo!'s servers by April, 2014.\n\nBetween 3% and 11% of the images captured by the webcams were sexually explicit in nature and deemed \"undesirable nudity\".\n\nThe documents mentioned interest in monitoring the video from the Xbox 360 and Xbox One's Kinect camera, something which Microsoft has reported it was oblivious to.\n\n"}

The Public Eye is a platform for substantial criticism of \"purely profit-oriented globalization\". The focus of the Public Eye Awards since 2005 has been on corporate social responsibility. In 2009, the Positive category was for the first time awarded for a courageous employee for his or her exemplary contributions.\n\nThe Public Eye was first hold in the year 2000 to accompany the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos critically. Together with the newspaper WOZ they organized an event under the name ″Who rules the world″ and organized a public discussion with the president of the WEF, Klaus Schwab. In the following year the Public Eye was extended to a multiple day counter-conference with 20 participants from NGOs and critical scientists. They also followed the WEF to New York in 2002, where the President of the Swiss Confederation, Kaspar Villiger, opened the conference.\n\nIn 2005 they introduced the Public Eye Awards as a renewal of the event, which was in future the main event of the Public Eye on Davos. In 2007, after Pro Natura stopped working on the event because the use of the event was too one-sited on the organizers of the WEF, Greenpeace was beside Erklärung von Bern the new organizing partner of the event. The Public Eye celebrated its ten-year anniversary on 28 January 2009. In 2015, Davos was for the last time the venue of the Public Eye Award with Chevron Corporation as winner of the lifetime award.\n\nChevron was 'awarded' namely for its activities of the past 10 years in Bolivia, that caused enormous ecological damage.\n\nAccording to Schweiz aktuell broadcast on 16 January 2015, a public presence during the WEF 2015 may not be guaranteed because the massively increased security in Davos. The Public Eye Award will be awarded for the last time in Davos: \"Public Eyes says Goodbye to Davos\", confirmed by the Rolf Marugg (now \"Landrats\" politician), by not directly enganed politicians, and by the police responsible. As communicated before by Erklärung von Bern on 19 November 2014, following the announcement of the \"Lifetime Award\" winner on 23 January 2015, a closing conference will be hold, with the participation of the \"Yes Men\", Sven Giegold, the Attac co-founder and European Parliamentarian, and Adrian Monck as Managing Director und Head of Public Engagement of the WEF association, as well as Noreena Hertz, economy professor and best-selling author.\n\n\nIn December 2013, Gazprom became the first company in the world to start drilling for oil in the Arctic Barents Sea.

According to the jury it had destroyed unique natural habitats, carried out forced resettlement of local people and polluted soil and rivers. Newmont described the information as misleading and said the project had been extensively studied by international and national environmental experts, members of the local communities, and by the appropriate governmental agencies and departments.\n\nBWFK FMB Energie AG received the Swiss Award for their participation at German coal-burning power plants and the same time propagation of power efficiency and renewable energy in Switzerland.\n\nThe positive Award was given to two members of the union Sintracarbon in Colombia for their fight for better work conditions for the workers in the country's biggest coal mine (El Cerrejón).\n\n\nBoth the People’s Award and the Global Award were given to French state-owned Areva for the suppression of true health conditions of uranium mine workers at subsidiaries Somaïr and Cominak in northern Niger. Therefore, the hospitals would diagnose patients with HIV when they were actually displaying symptoms of cancer caused by radioactive contamination of air, water and soil. Glencore was \"honored\" for its opaque business practices and unacceptable labor rights in Colombian coal mines.\n\nThe Positive Award went to Hess Natur, Germany’s largest mail-order house for natural fabrics, for its social and ecological involvement that stresses fair trade of its raw materials.\n\n\nBridgestone received the Global Award for the disastrous working conditions at a subsidiary in Liberia. The workers lived in mud huts, the children were forced to work, and they had to handle highly toxic materials without protection. Novartis received the Swiss Award for the patenting of the cancer drug Imatinib, forcing a halt in production of Indian generics. As a result, ten thousand patients worldwide could no longer afford medication that slowed the spread of leukemia. The product from Novartis is ten times more expensive than the generics.\n\nCoop received the Positive Award for its dedication to ecological products and farming in Switzerland.\n\n\nFor 30 years, Chevron allowed highly toxic waste water to flow into the Amazon in Ecuador, and for cost-saving reasons it did not pump the waste water back into the earth, which was normal practice at the time. Chevron refuses to pay for the environmental consequences and the health problems of the local communities. Citigroup received its award for the unscrupulous advice it gave to tax evaders. Disney produces toys in China and does not disclose the names of the suppliers, thus protecting them from industry monitoring.\n\nThe Positive Award was given to the three organizations for their efforts against the unlawful closure of a Continental tire factory in Mexico, in which all of the organizations’ demands were met.\n\n\nDow received its award for the refusal to accept any responsibility for the 1984 catastrophe in Bhopal. Dow merged with the company responsible for the accident. Shell received its award for gas flaring in Nigeria in residential areas. Wal-Mart denies responsibility for working conditions at its suppliers. KPMG received its award for encouraging its clients to practice aggressive tax evasion.\n\n"}

Originally, commanders of the sea defense zones were known as \"coastal commanders\" (\"Küstenbefehlshaber\"). In the summer of 1940, in preparation for Operation Sea Lion, the Kriegsmarine established seven \"sea command sectors\" (\"Seebefehlsstellen\") which were commanded by officers ranked \"Kapitän zur See\". All of the sea command sectors had been disestablished by the end of 1941.\n\nOriginal Sea Command Sectors (1940)\n\n\nIn the spring 1940, the Kriegsmarine began to reorganize coastal defense under a new position known as \"Kommandant der Seeverteidigung\" (Sea Defense Zone Commander). Between 1941 and 1945, the sea defense zones were expanded and retracted, gaining and losing territory to other zones or to the advance of allied or Red Army (Soviet) forces. Logistically, the sea defense zones were strictly a Navy command, but were integrated into the Atlantic Wall which was generally overseen by the German Army.\n\nSea defense zones were normally commanded by an officer ranked as either \"Kapitän zur See\" or \"Konteradmiral\". The sea defense zone commander answered to a Navy regional commander and would take tactical control over all shore forces in a given area should an enemy launch an attack against a segment of German coastline.\n\nThe only units permanently assigned to a sea defense zone were naval artillery batteries and anti-aircraft units. These units also maintained their own administrative chain of command in addition to falling under operational control of a sea defense zone. During an actual enemy attack, the sea defense commander became the direct superior for all Navy units in the zone's geographical area. This included all harbor defense units as well as naval infantry regiments. Typically, the sea defense zone commander would appoint as a deputy the commander of a major German port. The defense zone commander would himself report to a naval region commander who then acted in the capacity as a ground forces divisional commander. The ultimate command authority for all sea defense zones were the Navy Group commanders.\n\n"}
