The Apulo-Calabrese is one of the six autochthonous pig breeds recognised by the Ministero delle Politiche Agricole Alimentari e Forestali, the Italian ministry of agriculture and forestry.\n\nThe Apulo-Calabrese is particularly associated with the provinces of Catanzaro, Cosenza and Reggio di Calabria, and with the area of Lagonegro in the province of Potenza. In the early 20th century, local sub-types from these areas were known as the Catanzarese, the Cosentina, the Reggitana and the Lagonegrese respectively; these types are now considered extinct. The Calabrese was the principal pig of the region; in the mid-1920s the population was recorded as 131,736. Numbers fell drastically after the Second World War, and in particular from the 1970s, following the introduction of faster-growing foreign breeds such as the British Yorkshire. \n\nA herdbook was established in 2001, and is kept by the Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Suini, the Italian national association of pig breeders.

Hunting of blue whales was banned in 1966, and finally brought under control in the 1970s. By that time the blue whale population had been reduced to 0.15% of its original size.

The former head master of the Nansen Academy, Inge Eidsvåg, visited the rehabilitation ward for war injuries of the Kosovo Hospital in Sarajevo in 1994, and this visit triggered the idea of the Nansen Dialogue Project.\n\n\"I visited the rehabilitation ward for war injuries of the Kosovo Hospital in Sarajevo in 1994. This was before the Dayton Agreement and at the time Sarajevo was under siege. The five days I spent there made a big impression on me, and as soon as I was back in Norway I got in touch with the Norwegian Red Cross and the Norwegian Church Aid to suggest a joint project called \"Democracy, Human Rights and Peaceful Conflict Handling\", to which they agreed.\n\nA few weeks later on we had worked out a temporary program and applied for financial support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They decided to offer their support and later on the Peace Research Institute (PRIO) was invited to join in. In September 1995 we were able to welcome the first group of students from the former Yugoslavia. Within a year we had turned an idea into reality.\"\n\nAt first the project consisted solely of dialogue seminars in Lillehammer, but the participants felt that even if the dialogue seminars were helpful as they were the fact that only a privileged few could participate made it less successful than it could have been, given another structure. A Serbian and an Albanian woman who'd participated in the seminars decided to set up a Nansen Dialogue Center in Pristina in 1997. They set up dialogue seminars and invited both Albanians and Serbs from Kosovo to participate, and kept it up until the spring of 1999, when NATO bombs falling over Yugoslavia and Kosovo put a temporary end to them. The Center re-opened in 2000, and that year additional centers were opened in Podgorica, Skopje and Beograd. During the fall new Centers opened in Bosnia – Herzegovina, Sarajevo, Mostar and Banja Luka, and in 2001 in Osijek and Mestrovic. In 2005 the Bujanovac Center opened.\n\nToday there are 10 Dialogue Centers employing more than 60 people. They work with dialogue between ethnic groups who have previously been at war. More than 150 separate dialogue seminars between former enemies from conflicted areas has been held at the Nansen Academy premises, and it is still possible to attend workshops in Lillehammer. In addition to working with the former Yugoslavia the Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue has expanded their efforts to include participants from other conflicted areas, such as the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa. Steinar Bryn is in charge of the project.\n\nNansen Dialogue was merged with the Norwegian Peace Centre in 2010 into a new entity called the Nansen Center for Peace and Dialogue.\n\nThe Norwegian Peace Centre was founded in 1988, and the main focus of the establishment was to create a venue for peace work, such as workshops, seminars and courses in peace work and human rights.\n\nNansen Center for Peace and Dialogue\n"}

The two other members of the crew were known as \"Pete Sadler\" and \"Nguyen\". Their real names were Don Wade and Roma, a WLS team.\n\nAfter three tours in Vietnam, \"Dave Rabbit\" and his friends launched Radio First Termer from a secret studio in a Saigon brothel. The station broadcast for 63 hours over 21 nights (between 1 January 1971 and 21 January 1971).\n\nThe station played \"hard acid rock\" such as Steppenwolf, Bloodrock, Three Dog Night, Led Zeppelin, Sugarloaf, the James Gang, and Iron Butterfly, bands which were popular among the troops but largely ignored by the American Forces Vietnam Network. The music was mixed with antiwar commentary, skits poking fun at the U.S. Air Force and Lyndon B. Johnson, and raunchy sex and drug oriented jokes.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, sound clips from a Radio First Termer broadcast posted on the internet renewed interest in the station. In February 2006, \"Dave Rabbit\" came forward and told his story. He also did an interview for a bonus feature on the DVD release of \"Sir! No Sir!\", a film about G.I. counterculture during the Vietnam era.\n\nAlthough the frequency was always announced as FM69, in reality the show was broadcast over numerous frequencies, in addition to 69 MHz as selected by the Radio Relay troops across Vietnam. It was also broadcast over AM frequencies, including 690 AM.\n\nIn February 2008 audio clips of this underground radio show made their way into the hands Opie & Anthony and 3rd mic Jim Norton. They played some of the audio of these shows over the air at both their terrestrial radio show and their XM Satellite radio show and were impressed with the skills of Dave Rabbit back in \"the 'Nam\" which led to renewed interest on such sites as Google.\n\nA number of offshore radio stations have reportedly operated from the South China Sea, mainly for political purposes and these include Voice of the People's Liberation Army; Radio Flash; The October Storm; Redifussion Central; Popular of Peking. In 1990-1991, two other offshore radio stations intended for a Chinese audience made news in the world's press.\n\nOne of them was Radio Tiananmen, a station that was to be based aboard the MV \"Sarah\" (\"Lichfield I\") to be renamed \"Liberty\" that had been the former home of Radio Newyork International that broadcast briefly during two consecutive years in late 1980s from an anchorage off Jones Beach, New York. The idea was to anchor the ship in international waters off the Northeast coastline of the USA and to broadcast on behalf of the thousands of Chinese students studying in the USA in support of their fellow students who had demonstrated in Tiananmen Square. The idea faltered when the backers were told that the United States government would oppose an independent political station of this type.\n\nThe other station was created in France and sponsored by , a French magazine and The Face, a British magazine together with support from contributors in Hong Kong. The group called themselves \"Federation for Democracy in China\" and they bought a ship, which they renamed, \"Goddess of Democracy\", which was also the name of the proposed station. When the vessel sailed from La Rochelle, France it was intended for the ship to dock and that is where studios, transmitters and radio antenna would be installed. However, the project was abandoned after political and financial problems.\n\nIn 2006, Citizens' Radio was founded by a group of pro-democracy activists, including Tsang Kin-shing and legislator Leung Kwok-hung, also known as \"Long Hair\". It broadcast on weeknights from Chai Wan on 102.8 MHz FM.\n\nOn 30 November 2009, FM101, a station based in Kwun Tong commenced broadcasting, according to the South China Morning Post (1 December 2009). It was heard in the east of Kowloon and the east of Hong Kong Island. The station's founders include Leung King-wai, Tsang Chun-ying and Kwok Yiu-cheong. The latter two were formerly presenters for Citizens' Radio, but Citizens' Radio was not involved in its foundation, according to founder Tsang Kin-shing.\n\nIn reference to unlicensed land-based stations, the term \"underground radio\" is in common usage in Taiwan. The World United Formosans for Independence reportedly studied the possibility of broadcasting from the Philippines, but no concrete action materialised.\n\nThe underground radio movement began in the liberalising political milieu following the lifting of the decades-long martial law. Historically most of the stations have opposed, in some manner, the political establishment represented by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) and the Republic of China (ROC) framework, in favour of the then opposition movement broadly consisting of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and allied social movements. These so-called pan-green radio stations are mostly based in central and southern Taiwan with most listeners being hard-core pan-green supporters who despise Kuomintang rule and the potential for reunification with China. A few stations positioned themselves on the opposing end of the political spectrum, generally favouring the ROC status quo advocated by the New Party and \"non-mainstream factions\" within the Nationalist Party. With the DPP formerly in power, and ultimate Taiwan independence and sovereignty being the stance taken by most underground radio stations, Taiwan was one of the rare examples in the world of underground radio stations being pro-government.\n\nProgramming generally is of a vertical blocking format, with live call-ins taking up a good portion of air time. On some stations slots are allocated to local community and activist groups. The most prominent segment of the audience comes from rural working class, males usually middle aged and beyond. Taiwanese Hokkien is by far the most commonly used language on the air, although Mandarin and, much less frequently, Hakka are also used. Underground radio stations cover their expenses by selling unorthodox drugs or medicine in a humorous and entertaining manner to keep the listeners hooked between actual programming.\n\nMost if not all underground stations favour a mechanism to gain legal status but many balk at the costly requirements, which they believe to favour corporate and Nationalist-owned broadcasters. Government policy has always treated underground radio as an illegal enterprise, even after the DPP came to power. Official responses have been more varied, alternating between levying fines and confiscating equipment to tolerating their presence. Most stations are able to set up backup broadcast points within days of government raids. Commercial stations are known to file official complaints against pirate stations, whose signals are said to interfere with legal broadcasts.\n\nLicensed radio operations in the country are supervised by the National Telecommunications Commission and the same (along with the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas) has been involved in raids cracking down unlicensed stations. Despite the proliferation of pirate radio in various times and the agency's proper counteractions, the most documented notorious hub of unlicensed operators have been predominantly within Metro Manila while others are from Cebu and in some parts of Mindanao.\n\nThe most known unregulated radio station was 107.9 U-Radio. It began its broadcast in 2006, succeeding Power 108 FM, that shut down on August 31, 2004 on claims that the former station was a pirate. The station started broadcasting in Metro Manila at 107.9 MHz with the power of 100 watts, playing non-stop dance music, with no call sign and disc jockeys, and a stinger of a recorded female voiceover mentioning a mobile phone number that served as a request line in between queues. With hundreds of text messages being received daily, the station was a hot topic at dozens of blogs and forums over the internet.\n\nIn April 2007 they temporarily ceased transmission so they could obtain all the necessary broadcast permits from the National Telecommunications Commission to legitimize the station. In June 2007, U Radio returned on air under the temporary license of a community-based radio station and started broadcasting with the power of 500 watts.\n\nRecently, on April 20, 2013, 107.9 U-Radio ceased its operation, due to the claims of the Professional Regulations Commission and the National Telecommunications Commission that it was a pirate station, and its expired license. However, it continues its broadcast online.\n\nThe Filipino hip-hop and rap formatted station was founded in late 2015 by two-way radio dealer and proprietor Ron Flores Cruz at a Paco, Manila studio in time for then-candidate for President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign, initially as a limited-time nightly operation that later expanded to as much as 18 hours daily. At the onset of operations, the station's frequency was formerly occupied legitimately by the Polytechnic University of the Philippines' campus radio until it went on hiatus on November 2008. Its 50-watt signal covers parts of the immediate Manila area. \n\nListeners contended that the station was pirate due to the then-perceived absence of an immediate public concern over a massive crackdown on illegal drugs.\n\nOn July 2018, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines resumed test broadcasts on the same frequency with plans of resuming full-time services by September, forming a currently unresolved broadcasting conflict. Owing to the proximity of both Paco and Santa Mesa, Manila where the campus station is located, both have significantly interfered with each other.\n\nThe multiplexed pirate network of stations are heavily J-pop formatted outlets claiming as \"edgy radio stations\" in the whole of Metro Manila. The whole venture that was started on May 31, 2017, playing J-pop, anime and tokusatsu soundtracks and a series of Morse codes reading \"RKW\", is reportedly ran by a group led by an amateur radio operator. \nThe stations are respectively broadcasting on 107.1 FM as RKW-1 Southern Metro Manila and 89.5 FM as RKW-2 Northern Metro Manila, housed in Pasay City and Quezon City while maintaining a main studio located in Cavite City. The outlet later started simulcasting online. \n\nPrior to commencement of operations, the 89.5 FM spot was last legally operated as DLSU's Green Giant FM until when the station migrated exclusively online. Since 2013, the frequency, however has a presence in southern Metro Manila through Santo Tomas, Batangas-based DWEG 89.5. The 107.1 spot had previously been a dormant position since 2010, lastly occupied by Z-107 (DWYZ), a low-power hip-hop formatted station that ceased operations after failing to secure a renewed permit from the NTC.\n\nComplaints over the stations have been levelled due to its expletive-riddled and copyright infringed station ID that is using an altered version of Super Radyo DZBB 594's 2017 jingle. The stations have reportedly been illegally reusing callsigns, the first being DZTT at 89.5 (pronounced D-Z-double-T, a parody of the DZBB-AM calls) and DWBU at 107.1. The latter calls, however are legally held by the Bicol University campus radio. Furthermore, the stations have earned the ire of a non-profit group composed of broadcasters and radio enthusiasts.\n\nSo far, no documented actions by the National Telecommunications Commission against the stations have been released.\n\nAnother low-powered pirate station based in Cebu, Pathway Radio 100.7, started its operation around January 2017. Pathway Radio is a religious station operated at a very low power of 100 watts. The station has been a member of Community Broadcasters Association of the Philippines (CBAP), an organization consists of other community broadcasters across the Philippines and has no affiliation to the KBP.\n\nIn a report by \"Sun.Star\", there were 30 identified illegal radio stations that were allegedly operated within the Davao Region, including one owned by a Congressman. The NTC-XI issued a cease and desist order for 26 stations while issued a show-cause order for 4.\n\n"}

He is sometimes known as Robert FitzPernel.\n\nRobert was the eldest surviving son of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester and Petronilla de Grandmesnil, who was either a granddaughter or great-granddaughter of Hugh de Grandmesnil. As a young man, he accompanied King Richard I on the Third Crusade, and it was while the crusading forces rested at Messina, Sicily that Robert was invested with the Earldom of Leicester in early 1191. (His father had died on his way to the Holy Lands in 1190.)\n\nRobert's newly gained estates included a large part of central Normandy. He held castles at Pacy, Pont-Saint-Pierre and Grandmesnil. Earl Robert also was lord of the vast honor of Breteuil, but the family castle there had been dismantled after the 1173-1174 War. On his return from the crusade, he turned his attentions to the defense of Normandy from the French. After defending Rouen from the advances of Philip II of France, he attempted to retake his castle of Pacy. He was captured by forces of the French king and remained imprisoned for 3 years. Later, King John would bestow the new fortress and lordship of Radepont (the land of Radepont was traded to King John by the seigneur du Neubourg for lands and revenues in the pays de Caux) upon the earl.\n\nSometime after his release in 1196 he married Loretta de Braose, daughter of William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. They had no children, and Robert's death in 1204 brought the end of the Beaumont male line.\n\nIn the year of his death Normandy was lost to the French; Earl Robert attempted to come to an independent arrangement with King Philip of France, in which he would hold his land in Normandy as a liege-vassal of the Kings of France, and his lands in England as a liege-vassal of the Kings of England. In any event, Robert died that year, but his great English estates were divided between the heirs of his two sisters. The eldest sister, Amicia, had married the French baron Simon de Montfort, and their son, also named Simon de Montfort, inherited half the estate as well as the title of Earl of Leicester. The younger sister, Margaret, had married Saer de Quincy, and they inherited the other half. Three years later Saer was created Earl of Winchester.\n"}

It was founded by Chiang Wei-shui on 17 October 1921, in Daitōtei, a district in modern-day Taipei.\n\nAfter World War I, an epidemic of self-determination and democracy engulfed the world. Needless to say, Taiwan was also inundated with this new sense of independence. Inspired by the Samil Movement in Korea in 1919, Taiwanese college students in Japan further developed their craving for an independent Taiwan.\n\nAt that time, only affluent Taiwanese families could send their children to Japanese universities. Most of these children were born and raised during Japanese colonization of Taiwan. Therefore, they were taught using Japanese methods and customs quite different from the education of their parents, a formal Chinese education teaching strictly traditions and ancient philosophies. In Japan, Taiwanese students underwent extreme racism from not only Japanese students but also their friends and relatives. When improperly treated by the Japanese (e.g. being called ), these students would often search for methods of circumventing trouble. Due to these actions, though, they were often taunted by Korean students for not fighting for their own rights.\n\nJapan was not only the hub of advanced learning for Taiwanese students, but also an excellent opportunity to learn revolutionary ideas such as equality for all people and freedom, options that the oppressive Japanese Regime would not allow. This was where intellectuals adopted new and more innovated ideas in order to gain either independence or autonomy for Taiwan. These intellectuals often held conferences discussing beneficial possibilities. They petitioned the Japanese government to permit the enactment of a representative committee which spoke in favor of Taiwanese people, thus taking a vital step towards democracy. The committee, established in 1921, was called the Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament. Lin Hsien-tang was elected as their headperson. During its fourteen-year span, many rallies were held.\n\n\n\n"}
