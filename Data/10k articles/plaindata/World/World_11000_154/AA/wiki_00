{"id": "44828804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44828804", "title": "Dalmatian city-states", "text": "Dalmatian city-states\n\nDalmatian city-states were the Dalmatian localities where the local Romance population survived the Barbarian invasions after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 400s CE. Eight little cities were created by those autochthonous inhabitants that maintained political links with the Byzantine Empire (that defended these cities allowing their commerce). The original name of the cities was \"Jadera, Spalatum, Crespa, Arba, Tragurium, Vecla, Ragusium\" and \"Cattarum\". The language and the laws where initially Latin, but after a few centuries they developed their own neo-Latin language (the \"Dalmatico\"), that lasted until the 19th century. The cities were maritime centres with a huge commerce mainly with the Italian peninsula and with the growing Republic of Venice.\n\nDalmatia after the fall of the Roman Empire consisted of a group of autochthonous coastal cities functioning much like city-states, with extensive autonomy, but without control of the rural hinterland controlled by the Slavic tribes who arrived after 640 AD.\n\nEthnically, Dalmatia started out as a Roman region, with a romance culture that began to develop independently, forming the now-extinct Dalmatian language called \"Dalmatico\". So, these cities were characterized by common Latin laws, Catholic religion, the same romance language, common commerce and same political/administrative structures and entities.\n\nThe eight City-states were:\n\nLater were added other cities in north-central Dalmatia, like Sebenicum (actual Šibenik), Flumen (actual Rijeka) and Pagus (actual Pag).\n\nIndeed, in the Early Medieval period, Byzantine Dalmatia was ravaged by an Avar invasion that destroyed its capital, Salona, in 639 AD, an event that allowed for the settlement of the nearby Diocletian's Palace in Spalatum by Salonitans, greatly increasing the importance of the city. The Avars were followed by the great South Slavic migrations.\n\nThe Slavs, loosely allied with the Avars, permanently settled the region in the first half of the 7th century AD and remained its predominant ethnic group ever since. The Croats soon formed their own realm: the Principality of Dalmatian Croatia ruled by native Princes of Guduscan origin. The meaning of the geographical term \"Dalmatia\", now shrunk to the cities and their immediate hinterland. These cities and towns remained influential as they were well fortified and maintained their connection with the Byzantine Empire. The two communities were somewhat hostile at first, but as the Croats became Christianized this tension increasingly subsided. A degree of cultural mingling soon took place, in some enclaves stronger, in others weaker, as Slavic influence and culture was more accentuated in Ragusium and Cattarum while the influence from the Italian peninsula was stronger in the northern Dalmatia islands and in Jadera and Spalatum.\n\nAround 950 AD as the Dalmatian city states gradually lost all protection by Byzantium, being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions, they had to turn to Venice for support. Each of the Dalmatian city states needed protection (even from Narentane piracy), based mostly on economic reasons. In the year 1000 AD an expedition of Venetian ships in coastal Istria and Dalmatia secured the Venetian suzerainty in the area, and the Narentines, Slav pirates, were suppressed permanently. In the occasion Doge Orseolo named himself \"Duke of Dalmatia\", starting the colonial Empire of Venice.\n\nThe Venetians, to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture, could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic. The seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as the new \"queen\" of the Adriatic sea. In return for protection, these 8 \"neolatin\" cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. Arbe (actual Rab), for example, annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice. The Dalmatian cities might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges; their Roman law remained valid and they were even permitted to conclude separate alliances.\n\nIn these centuries started to disappear the Dalmatian language, that was assimilated by the venetian dialect.Dalmatian was spoken on the Dalmatian coast from Fiume (now Rijeka) as far south as Cottorum (Kotor) in Montenegro. Speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of Jadera (Zadar), Tragurium (Trogir), Spalatum (Split), Ragusium (Dubrovnik) and also on the islands of Curicta (Krk), Crepsa (Cres) and Arba (Rab). Almost every city developed its own dialect, but the most important dialects we know of were \"Vegliot\", a northern dialect spoken on the island of Curicta, and \"Ragusan\", a southern dialect spoken in and around Ragusa (Dubrovnik).\n\nThe cities of Jadera, Spalatum, Tragurium and Ragusium and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice, Hungary and the Byzantium during the 12th century. In 1202, the armies of the Fourth Crusade rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Jadera, that started to be officially called \"Zara\". In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory.\n\nThe late 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities. The Dalmatian cities started accepting complete foreign sovereignty, mainly the one of the Republic of Venice. The only exception was Ragusium, that remained independent creating the Republic of Ragusa that lasted until the 1807 Napoleon conquest.\n\nFrom 1420 started the venetian domination of the other seven of the original Dalmatian City-States, that were fully integrated in the venetian (and Italian) society of the Italian Renaissance. Zara become the capital of Venetian Dalmatia - as part of the Stato da Mar- until the 1797 end of the Republic of Venice and in the next centuries the city was the main center of the Dalmatian Italians.\n\nThe last speaker of any Dalmatian dialect of the Dalmatian City-States was Tuone Udaina (), who was accidentally killed in an explosion on June 10, 1898 in the island of Veglia (actual Krk) With him disappeared the last vestige of the Dalmatian neolatin cities. His language was studied by the scholar Matteo Bartoli, himself a native of nearby Istria, who visited him in 1897 and wrote down approximately 2,800 words, stories, and accounts of his life, which were published in a book that has provided much information on the vocabulary, phonology, and grammar of the language. Bartoli wrote in Italian and published a translation in German (\"\") in 1906: this book is considered the first on ethnic minority disappearance in world literature.\n\nThe boundaries of the eight original Dalmatian City-States were defined by the so-called \"Dalmatian Pale\", similar to the one existing in Ireland under British control and called The Pale. The word \"pale\" derives ultimately from the Latin word \"palus\", meaning stake, specifically a stake used to support a fence. From this came the figurative meaning of \"boundary\" and eventually the phrase \"\", as something outside the boundary. The term was used not only for the \"Pale\" in Ireland and in Dalmatia but also for various other English colonial settlements, notably Pale of Calais, and later for the Jewish Pale in Russia.\n\nHistorian Johannes Lucius added to the \"Dalmatia Pale\" (somewhat similar to the \"English Pale\" in Ireland, as boundary of Roman local laws) of these Dalmatian City-States even Fiume (actual Rijeka) and Sebenico (actual Sibenik), after the year 1000 when Venice started to take control of the region.\n\nIndeed, Fiume was the former Roman \"Tarsatica\": the city of that medieval period was a small fortified town under the Italian Aquileia (and Pola) bishops, enclosed within the town walls which had several defense towers. The town, called Flumen, was granted autonomy in the 11th century by the bishop and was divided into two parts: in the upper part, there was a medieval castle/formerly Roman fort and the church of St. Vitus (thus the name 'Flumen Sancti Viti'), while in the lower part - the popular- there was a commercial and trading center where around the year 1000 many Italian merchants settled.\n\nSebenicum was the ancient Roman city of \"Burnum\" destroyed by the Avars and rebuilt in the 9th century by the Croats. Pope Boniface VIII signed in 1298 a \"bolla\" that declared a bishop for the town, that so was to be a \"Free City\" from the local Ban Paul I Šubić of Bribir.\n\nFurthermore, about \"Sebenico\" Thomas Jackson wrote that:\n\nLucius wrote even that \"Pagus\" (the Venetian Pago, actually called Pag) had municipal autonomy virtually independent for centuries around the year 1000. In 1244 the Hungarian King Béla IV named it a \"Free royal city\" and in 1376 Louis I of Hungary granted it autonomy. In 1409, Pago, together with the whole island, passed permanently to the Republic of Venice and had reconfirmed their communal autonomy guaranteed by a board of 50 civic local aristocratic families (this board was created in 1451).\n\n\n"}

Genetic studies disprove this for example Haplogroup E3B has been proven by science to have begun in the Near East.\n\nAfrican mtDNA (Haplogroup L which is genetically isolated) is rare in Europe although much more common than African Y-DNA. It is most common in Portugal where 5% of people have it, though outside of Portugal it quite rare (consistently lower than 1%). For example, its frequencies run at 0.7% in Finland, 0.4% in Spain, and 0.1% in Ireland. As in Y-DNA many Caucasian mtDNA haplogroups (such as U6 and H1) and also some Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups such as (M1) are often wrongly described as African; probably because they can be found at high frequencies in the Afro-Eurasian speakers who also have a high consistency of Caucasian Y-DNA haplogroups.\n\nThe early history of Eastern Eurasian and African interactions with Europe can be found by the genetics of contemporary European populations. Both populations seem to have had little influence on Europe. Less than 1% of Europeans (including Spaniards) have African y-dna or mtDNA.\n\nEastern Eurasian dna is much more common and is represented mostly by the presence of haplogroup N3 in far north east Europe. Many African populations have a large proportion of western Eurasian DNA particularly north Africa which is about 90% western Eurasian the above study is confirmed by y-dna and mtDNA analysis of north Africa for example over 90% of north African men belong to the western Eurasian E3B,J,G, or R1 haplogroups In sub-Saharan Africa amounts of western Eurasian DNA can be found in speakers of the afro-Asiatic language branch.\n\nIn modern Europe up to 1% of the population is African (excluding north African) in origin.\n\nIn modern Europe up to 1% of the population is eastern Eurasian in origin.\n"}

His papers were some of the first to analyse \"profit shifting\", and to establish quantitative features of tax havens. Hines showed that being a tax haven could be a prosperous strategy for a jurisdiction, and controversially, that tax havens can promote economic growth.

(see )\n\nThe two most recent U.S. congressional investigations into tax havens: the 2008 investigation by the Government Accountability Office, and the 2015 investigation by the Congressional Research Service, identify the 1994 Hines-Rice paper as the first credible list of global tax havens, and the first quantitative analysis of what constitutes a tax haven.\n\nHis subsequent 2007-2011 papers on tax havens showed that major tax havens, including Ireland, Singapore, Bermuda, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, were well governed and prosperous economies, from being tax havens: \"Tax havens are successful players in the world economy\". He also asserted that tax havens could \"stimulate economic activity in nearby high-tax countries\", by addressing issues in their tax systems, however this conclusion has been controversial and has drawn criticism from advocates of \"tax justice\" as being supportive of corporate tax avoidance by multinationals.\n\nWhile Hines always avoided constructing overly specific or quantitative definitions of a tax haven, because of the variability in the types of economies that he had identified as tax havens, Hines does use a general definition that he employed during research with fellow tax-haven expert, Dhammaka Dharmapala, in 2009:\n\nIn November 2017, Hines was awarded the Daniel M. Holland Medal medal by the National Tax Association for his work, the second youngest winner in the medal's history.\n\nIn December 2017, his papers were cited by Harvard Professor Mihir A. Desai as ones that: \"changed the field and provided the roadmap for much of the next thirty years\".\n\nAs well as his work on BEPS and on tax havens, Hines is known for research into how U.S. corporate taxation, and the marginal rate of U.S. corporation tax, drives the behaviours of U.S multinationals. Hines has been a strong advocate of moving the U.S. to a \"territorial\" tax model. In 2016, Hines, working with German academics, showed that German multinationals make little use of tax havens because the German corporate taxation system follows a \"territorial\" model. Hines cites the experience of Ireland, a feature on all of Hines' tax haven lists, who has rarely attracted firms from \"territorial\" taxation systems.\n\nHis research in this area was cited, although sometimes controversially so, by the Council of Economic Advisors (\"CEA\") in drafting the TCJA legislation in 2017; and advocating for reducing U.S. corporate taxes and moving to a hybrid \"territorial\" tax system framework, in order to drive U.S employment and wage growth.\n\nBecause it is cited as the first coherent academic list of tax havens, the 41 jurisdictions from Appendix 2 in Hines-Rice (1994) are listed below, in the three sub-categories Hines-Rice used. The 7 \"major tax havens\" identified by Hines-Rice, who represent over 89% of tax haven GDP, are marked with a dagger (†).\n\nHines-Rice note that the U.S. IRS had identified 29 of their list as potential tax havens in 1987:\nHines-Rice note that Beauchamp had identified 7 of their list as potential tax havens in 1983:\n\nHines-Rice note that Doggart had identified 5 of their list as potential tax havens in 1983:\n\nIn a 2010 research paper, Hines produced a revised list of 52 tax havens, and also a method of quantifying and ranking the largest of them (Hines did not rank the whole list). Only two the ten largest havens in Hines' 2010 list appeared in the OECD's 2000 list of tax havens (by 2017, the OECD list only contained Trinidad & Tobago). A major quantitative study in July 2017 study by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET group, produced a list of havens that matched nine of the ten largest havens in Hines' list, but split into two types of haven: Conduit and Sinks. Another major quantitative study in June 2018 by Gabriel Zucman (et alia), produced a list whose ten largest havens also matched nine of Hines' top ten havens from 2010. Zucman calculated that Ireland had now become the largest of the ten major havens (Ireland's largest firms, Apple, Google and Facebook were smaller in 2010). \n\nTen largest havens, as specifically estimated by Hines, from the Hines 2010 list of 52 tax havens:\n\n(*) Identified as one of the largest 10 corporate tax havens on the Zucman-Tørsløv-Wier 2018 list in 2018 (Cayman and the British Virgin Islands appear as \"Caribbean\").<br>\n(†) Identified as one of the 5 Conduits (Ireland, Singapore, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), by CORPNET in 2017.<br>\n(‡) Identified as one of the largest 5 Sinks (British Virgin Islands, Luxemburg, Hong Kong, Jersey, Bermuda), by CORPNET in 2017.<br>\n(Δ) Identified on the first, and the largest, OECD 2000 list of 35 tax havens (the OECD list only contained Trinidad & Tobago by 2017).\n\nThe full list of 52 tax havens from the Hines 2010 list, are shown below (Hines did not rank the full list, only the largest):\n\n(†) Identified as one of the 5 Conduits by CORPNET in 2017; the above list has 4 of the 5.<br>\n(‡) Identified as one of the largest 24 Sinks by CORPNET in 2017; the above list has 21 of the 24.<br>\n(↕) Identified on the European Union's first 2017 list of 17 tax havens; the above list contains 8 of the 17.<br>\n(Δ) Identified on the first, and the largest, OECD 2000 list of 35 tax havens (the OECD list only contained Trinidad & Tobago by 2017); the above list contains 34 of the 35.<br>\n\nThe following are the most cited papers on tax havens as ranked on the IDEAS/RePEc economic papers database, of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, over the last 25 years.\n\nAs well as being the most cited individual author on tax havens, Hines has authored or co-authored five of the ten most referenced papers on tax havens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8315620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8315620", "title": "Leakage effect", "text": "Leakage effect\n\nIn the study of tourism, the leakage is the way in which revenue generated by tourism is lost to other countries' economies. Leakage may be so significant in some developing countries that it partially neutralizes the money generated by tourism.\n\nLeakage occurs through seven different mechanisms. It is an intrinsic component of international tourism and thus is present in every country, to widely varying degrees.\n\nMany countries must purchase goods and services to satisfy their visitors. This includes the cost of raw materials used to make tourism-related goods, such as souvenirs. For starting tourism industries, this is a significant problem, as some countries must import as much as 50% of tourism-related products.\n\nSome less economically developed countries do not have the domestic ability to build tourism-related infrastructure (hotels, airports, etc.). The cost of such infrastructure is then leaked out of the country.\n\nSmaller countries often require foreign investment to start their tourism industry. Thus, profits from tourism may be lost to foreign investors. In addition, travel agents outside of the destination country remove money from that market as well.\n\nMany countries spend considerable sums of money for advertisements and publicity. Maintaining a presence abroad may increase the volume of tourists to a country but also represent a considerable loss of money to foreign markets.\n\nMany foreign companies manipulate their pricing to reduce taxes and other duties. In smaller or less developed countries, where many tourism-related companies may be foreign owned, this can represent a substantial loss of income.\n\nCountries with a small tourism industry may have to give tax exemptions or other offers to increase foreign investment. While this may enlarge the tourism industry there, it must be taken into account as an instrument of income loss.This will lead to lost in income to the host nation as various tax exemptions are provided\n\nOften foreign workers are employed in tourism and especially on a temporary base. These workers typically stay a couple of months in the country, they live on the premises and take all the salary home when they return home after their assignment. Depending the portion of this type of foreign workers it can represent a substantial loss of income.\n\nA study of tourism 'leakage' in Thailand estimated that 70% of all money spent by tourists ended up leaving Thailand (via foreign-owned tour operators, airlines, hotels, imported drinks and food, etc.). Estimates for other Third World countries range from 80% in the Caribbean to 40% in India.\n\nLeakage is not restricted to less-developed countries. Australia experiences a significant leakage effect from Japanese tourists. Though they spend the most per capita of all tourists to Australia, much of what they spend is through Japanese travel companies, Japanese hotels, and other foreign-owned businesses. There is thus significant leakage to Japan's economy.\n\nLeakage not only varies from country to country, but also from industry to industry. High-income tourism may well significantly increase leakage, as that industry likely involves importing more goods and services than usual. Ecological or adventure tourism may exhibit a very small degree of leakage, however, as they place value solely on what the host country has to offer.\n\nAs a result of the leakage effect, tourism industries in developed countries often are much more profitable per dollar received than tourism in smaller countries. Islands, in particular, suffer from significant leakage. In countries such as Turkey and the United Kingdom, the benefit to the economy from tourism is twice the dollar amount spent by tourists. In smaller places, such as Micronesia and Polynesia, that benefit is half the dollar amount spent. Some locations have managed to nullify the leakage effect almost entirely - New York City claims to generate seven dollars for the local economy per dollar spent by tourists. Some estimates of the degree of leakage claim only 5% of money spent on tourism remains in a developing country's economy.\n\nFor many countries, some sources of leakage are unavoidable. Foreign-owned hotels and airlines are necessary for all but the most established of tourism industries. However, encouragement of domestic involvement in a country's tourism industry may reduce leakage in the long run. Currently, the most popular measure is restrictions on spending. Countries may limit the use of foreign currency within their borders, reducing the effect of transfer pricing (see above). Many countries require visitors to have a certain amount of money before entering, as well.\n\n"}

ZNY assumes a route control over four extremely busy Class B airports; most of the air traffic in and out of the New York Metropolitan Area. \n\nDue to multiple factors within the airspace, the ZNY ARTCC is often regarded as one of the most complex airspaces in the United States, and is also one of the busiest in the world with respect to volume of traffic versus volume of airspace.\n\nThe Center is located at 4205 Johnson Avenue on Long Island in Ronkonkoma, a hamlet (unincorporated community) in the Town of Islip, New York, United States, near New York City. Long Island MacArthur Airport is north of the ARTCC.\n\nIts primary responsibility is the separation of overflights, and the expedited sequencing of arrivals and departures along Standard Terminal Arrival Routes and Standard Instrument Departures for the entire New York Metropolitan Area and Philadelphia. \n\nZNY assumes control over several \"Class Bravo\" (Class B) airports, including\n\nNew York Center manages of airspace. Of that, are mainland airspace, and the remaining is oceanic airspace.\n\nThe sector shelves start as low 0 AGL and top out as high as Flight Level 600 (60,000 ft) ASL. ZNY handles a total of 28 sectors, excluding Oceanic sectors. These are broken down into Low Altitude and High Altitude sectors, with 16 Low Altitude sectors and 12 High altitude sectors. Within the Center there are 6 Areas, which other ARTCC's might call specialties.\n\nIn ZNY, the Areas are Lettered A through F. \n\nArea A covers the southeast edge of Pennsylvania. Area A puts arrivals in trail for Philadelphia TRACON via the BUNTS feed (its busiest) heading to Philadelphia Int'l (PHL), Wilmington DE Airport (ILG) and other Eastern PA and Northern NJ airports. The area also feeds traffic into PCT (Potomac Consolidated TRACON) which runs arrivals and departures for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD), and other area airports. Area A also feeds Harrisburg Approach, controlling Harrisburg Int'l (MDT), Lancaster Airport (LNS), York (THV), Reading Regional Airport (RDG), Allentown Airport (ABE) and other PA airports. Area A's high altitude sectors work departures from all the above airports, and feed them into existing streams received from Area B departing NY & BOS metro areas as well as those coming from over the ocean and from Canada. This traffic is handed off in trail on en route airways to Washington Center (ZDC) to the South and Cleveland Center (ZOB) to the West.\n\nArea B covers the East side of Pennsylvania, the northern half of New Jersey, and Long Island west of Deer Park (DPK). Area B controls departures heading west, south, and southwest out of \"N90\" (New York TRACON). Area B sequences most of those departures into streams for the STARs to \"BWI\", \"IAD\", and \"DCA\". Area B also sequences all Boston Logan (BOS) arrivals travelling over JFK Airport (JFK) and Hartford's Bradley International Airport (BDL).\n\nArea C covers the northern edge of Pennsylvania, and controls both eastbound arrivals into \"JFK\" on the LENDY6 STAR and some westbound departures out of \"N90\".\n\nArea D is in the middle of Pennsylvania and borders the Cleveland ARTCC's (ZOB) east border. Area D handles the \"PHL\" SPUDS2/SLATT3 STAR along with \"PHL\" departures departing via the PTW (Pottstown VOR, or VHF omnidirectional range) exit westbound. Area D's High Altitude sectors handle all westbound \"N90\" departures, and the MIP4 (Milton 4) STAR into \"LGA\" and FQM3 (Williamsport 3) STAR into \"EWR\".\n\nArea E is the first set of Oceanic sectors that mainly have control over the Atlantic just offshore from New York and New Jersey. Area E maintains 2 radar sectors that are both 'offshore'. The first is Sector 66. This sectors owns airspace to the southeast of Kennedy (South of Long Island). There are no VORs or airports within this sector. However, this is one of the busiest, and most difficult, sectors within the facility, mainly due to numerous aircraft that are 'head-on' and are required to descend/ascend through each other's altitudes. Because of this, there is a lot of vectoring and speed control involved. Warning area 107, when active, takes a big chunk of the sector's airspace, thus adding to its complexity. The second 'offshore' radar sector in Area E is Sector 82. Aircraft are off-loaded to this sector when there is weather along the east coast of the US. The rest of the sectors in Area E are all non-radar (ATOP) sectors that control traffic going to/from the Caribbean Islands and Bermuda.\n\nArea F is the other set of Oceanic sectors, and maintains control of the North and South Atlantic. Area F assumes responsibility for three \"mainland\" high altitude oceanic sectors just off the coast of New York. This sector becomes extremely busy during the holiday season as many flights are destined for Caribbean and when adverse weather is approaching the eastern seaboard as many flights file flight plans with off shore routing. Complexity in these sectors can make it very challenging due to traffic climbing and descending, crossing, and holding in the sector. The military operates in several warning areas in the airspace, once activated it reduces the airspace by nearly half its original size and capacity. Since there is no defined route structure like most sectors, traffic flows are random, thus increasing difficulty. This area deals with multiple facilities from other countries, such as Santa Maria, Gander, Moncton, San Juan and Piarco. Each facility has its own method and procedure for coordinating aircraft. Area F also controls the area of the North Atlantic including approach control into Bermuda. (Bermuda International Airport only controls flights that are in class D airspace.) The rest of the sectors in Area F are all non-radar (ATOP) sectors. They control flights that are crossing to/from Europe in the North and South Atlantic.\n\nAreas E and F are bordered by:\n\n\n\n\n\n87 CHAMP, 88 BACUS, 89 KRAFT, 90 GRATX (All ATOPS sectors/Ocean 21)\n\n16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 (All ATOP sectors)\n\nArinc (New York Radio) handles all Communications on HF Frequencies.\n\n\n "}

{"id": "24053563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24053563", "title": "St. Gallen Symposium", "text": "St. Gallen Symposium\n\nThe St. Gallen Symposium, formerly known as the \"Internationales Management Symposium\" and the \"ISC-Symposium\", is an annual conference taking place at the University of St. Gallen in St. Gallen, Switzerland. It is the world’s leading initiative for intergenerational debates on economic, political, and social developments between decision makers of today and tomorrow. The symposium’s goal is to contribute to the preservation and further development of a social and liberal economic order.\n\nThe St. Gallen Symposium was founded in 1969 as a response to the international student unrests of 1968 and has since then been organised by the \"International Students’ Committee (ISC)\", a student initiative at the University of St. Gallen. Currently, this platform for dialogue welcomes more than 1.000 participants every year and is among the largest and most eminent student-run events. Personalities such as Josef Ackermann, Mohammad Khatami, Laurence D. Fink, Dominic Barton, Sigmar Gabriel and Christine Lagarde have attended the symposium in recent years.\n\nThe St. Gallen Symposium as a platform for dialogue strives to foster constructive debates on current economic, political and social developments. This event gives particular attention to an intergenerational dialogue, characterised by mutual respect. Thus, particular focus is given to discussion in smaller, more informal settings, where the so-called \"Leaders of Tomorrow\" can debate with the \"Leaders of Today\" on equal footing.\n\nThe topic of the symposium is chosen each year based on relevant issues and current events. In recent years, the topic has developed from being more business-oriented to more holistic themes, as embodied by the topics \"Growth – the good, the bad, and the ugly\" (2016), \"The dilemma of disruption\" (2017) and \"Beyond the end of work\" (2018).\n\nFive students of the University of St. Gallen – Clemens Ernst Brenninkmeyer, Franz Karl Kriegler, Urs Schneider, Wolfgang Schürer and Terje I. Wølner-Hanssen – founded the International Students’ Committee (ISC), which has since organised the St. Gallen Symposium annually. It was established in February 1970 as an alternative to the international student unrests of 1968. The name \"International Students’ Committee\" was chosen because of the five different countries the founders originated from, namely Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. On 30 June and 1 July 1970 the first \"International Management Dialogue\" was held at the University of St. Gallen, with 100 outstanding students and as many business leaders taking part.\n\nThe Club of Rome study \"The Limits to Growth\", which analysed the effect of exponential growth on a finite planet, was presented at the third symposium in 1972. The global economic downturn caused by the 1973 oil crisis and problems with securing the continuity of the student initiative led to the symposium not being held in 1974. In response, the St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies was founded in order to safeguard the continuity of the International Students’ Committee.\n\nA big change was introduced in 1989, when the International Students’ Committee founded the \"St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award\", which today counts as one of the largest and most renowned student essay competitions worldwide. Students were now required to submit an essay, of which only the 200 best were selected for a participation in the St. Gallen Symposium. Moreover, authors of the best contributions were bestowed with the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award, CHF 20,000.– in prize money, and the chance to present their essays at the St. Gallen Symposium (see below).\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the ISC has tried to raise the international profile of the symposium, as well as improve the quality of the dialogue. In this restructuring, a new logo was introduced and the name \"International Management Symposium\" was changed to ISC-Symposium. Moreover, the ISC gave a financial support for the construction of the Executive Campus HSG at the University of St. Gallen during this period.\n\nWith the burst of the dot-com bubble, the September 11 attacks and the bankruptcy of Swissair – one of the symposium’s most important benefactors – the beginning of the new millennium posed great challenges for the subsequent year.\n\nIn 2002 the Swiss Federal Council commissioned the ISC to organise the International Conference on Federalism while maintaining the structure of the symposium.\n\nThe current name, St. Gallen Symposium, was introduced in 2005.\n\nIn the following year Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United Nations, received the Freedom Prize of the Max Schmidheiny Foundation, which was already awarded to him in 2003.\n\nFor the 40 St. Gallen Symposium in 2010, a comprehensive modernisation of the conceptual design followed in order to foster intergenerational dialogue. The duration of the symposium was reduced by half a day to two days and so-called Topic Leaders, who are responsible for the moderation of several sessions, joined the group of speakers. Furthermore, the so-called Knowledge Pool enlarged the selection of student participants. The Knowledge Pool consists of 100 students who are handpicked by the ISC and aims at setting an antipole to the 100 winners of the mainly academical student essay competition, the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award. Furthermore, the Global Perspectives Barometer was introduced, which has since been conducted annualy in collaboration with GfK-Verein (Credit Suisse until 2013) among current and past student participants to survey their opinion on prevailing challenges.\n\nTo enhance the awareness about the St. Gallen Symposium in Asia, the ISC opened an office in Singapore in 2012. Furthermore, due to the strategic reorientation, a new group of participants, the \"Aspiring Leaders\", and \"Year-Round Events\" were introduced. The \"Aspiring Leaders\" are young decision makers who reached their first milestones and thus fill the gap between the \"Leaders of Tomorrow\" and \"Leaders of Today\". The \"Year-Round Events\" fulfill the aim of the St. Gallen Symposium to create an intergenerational dialogue throughout the whole year, as opposed to only the St. Gallen Symposium itself. The biggest \"Year-Round Events\" are the Singapore Reception in November and the Zurich Reception in January.\n\nThe St. Gallen Symposium takes place during three days in the beginning of May. The official program includes different kind of sessions: \n\n\nApart from Public Insight Sessions, the sessions are snot open to the public. However, selected Plenary Sessions are live and broadcast on the St. Gallen Symposium’s official Youtube channel. Furthermore, with the support of the Ria & Arthur Dietschweiler Foundation, key findings of the annual symposium are presented and discussed in the St. Gallen Symposium \"Public Forum.\"\n\nThe St. Gallen Symposium has three equally important participant groups: the \"Leaders of Today\", the \"Leaders of Tomorrow\", and the \"Aspiring Leaders\".\n\nThe \"Leaders of Today\" consist of 600 decision makers from the economic, political, social and academic fields. This group can be separated into partners, business participants, guests, speakers and Topic Leaders, which moderate the discussions.\n\nThe \"Leaders of Tomorrow\" are 200 outstanding personalities and young minds below the age of 30. Their qualification is evaluated according to the criteria for the \"St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award\" or the \"Knowledge Pool\". The people who are selected through the \"Knowledge Pool\" must fulfill several criteria, such as a relation to the topic of the St. Gallen Symposium or special achievements. The St. Gallen Symposium wants to offer a platform for dialogue to the student participants, where they are able to discuss on one level with today’s decision makers. Furthermore, the students should challenge these decision makers, allowing new lines of thought and potential solutions for current issues to evolve.\n\nThe \"Aspiring Leaders\" are decision makers who have the potential to take on a leading role, not only in a specific company, but also in the whole industry. \"Aspiring Leaders\" consist of two main groups \"Future Corporate Leaders\" and \"Emerging Entrepreneurs\". They have already reached the first milestones and thus form the link between the Leaders of Today and the Leaders of Tomorrow; this also in terms of age.\n\nEvery year, during the St. Gallen Symposium, the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award is awarded. The St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award is an essay competition for students from all over the world. In addition, from 1979 to 2003, the St. Gallen Symposium was the platform for the bestowal of the Max Schmidheiny Foundation’s Freedom Prize.\n\nThe St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award is an essay competition for students on graduate or postgraduate level. The authors of the 100 best submissions get the chance travel to St. Gallen for one week and participate in the St. Gallen Symposium. Since the essay’s topic is always related to the symposium’s main topic of discussion, the five best authors have the possibility to present their essay in front of the global audience during the Conference. It is endowed with CHF 20’000. With more than 1000 contributions from over 60 different countries annually, the St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award belongs to the biggest student essay competitions of its kind.\nThe evaluation process is completely anonymous and carried out by a preliminary jury and a main jury. The preliminary jury consists of PhD students of the University of St. Gallen as well as the ETH Zurich whereas the main jury comprises professors, corporate executives, entrepreneurs and politicians. The current president of the preliminary jury is Heike Bruch and the main jury’s president is Georg F. von Krogh. Other members of the main jury are Peter Day, Nigel Fretwell, Aditya Ghosh, and Riz Khan. \n\nThe St. Gallen Wings of Excellence Award was first launched in 1989 to select the student participants for the symposium and has been modified several times in the past. The most essential adjustment was the restriction of the eligibility to graduate and postgraduate students in 2009 and a simultaneous reduction of the invitations based on the essay competition from 200 to 100 invitations. The other 100 students have since then been recruited by the ISC through the so-called Knowledge Pool.\n\nFrom 1979 until 2003 the Max Schmidheiny Foundation annually awarded its Freedom Prize during the symposium. The prestigious honourees include Kofi Annan, Nicolas Hayek, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Jorma Ollila and Muhammad Yunus. In 2003 the Max Schmidheiny Foundation decided to focus on other activities and abandoned the Freedom Prize.\n\nSince its establishment in 1969, the St. Gallen Symposium has been organised by the International Students’ Committee, an independent non-profit organisation and an accredited association of the University of St. Gallen. Every year, it consists of a team of about 30 students from the University of St. Gallen, who pause their studies for one year. This team includes three – in former years two – members of the previous ISC-Team who form the Head of the Organising Committee. During the Symposium, the ISC is supported by a crew of about 400 volunteers, all students from the University of St. Gallen. Martin Blessing, Konrad Hummler, Walter Kielholz and Christoph Loos are among the most famous alumni of the ISC.\n\nThe St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies acts as the supervisory body and ensures the continuity of the symposium given the annually changing organising team. The foundation consists of about twelve members, with Beat Ulrich being the current CEO. Former CEOs include Philip Erzinger, Andreas Kirchschläger and Wolfgang Schürer.\n\nThe Board of Trustees supervises the St. Gallen Foundation for International Studies with Peter Voser and Karin Keller-Sutter as its Chairman and Vice Chairman respectively. Further members are Thomas Bieger, Peter Gomez, Bénédict G. F. Hentsch, Christian Mumenthaler, Christoph Loos, Walter Kielholz, Ralph Schmitz-Dräger, Gerhard Schwarz and Bettina Würth. Josef Ackermann is the honorary chairman and former member of the board.\n\nThe 1974 established Circle of Benefactors constitutes the key element in the non-profit organisation’s funding. Currently, it encompasses more than 400 companies, which commit themselves for three years at a time to support the St. Gallen Symposium with a certain financial amount. By establishing this long-term relation, the continuity is secured and a situation as in 1974, when the symposium had to be cancelled, can be prevented. Besides the participation in the St. Gallen Symposium, these partners receive an invitation to the Dinner for the Circle of Benefactors, taking place on the Wednesday of the Symposium. \n\nWithin this circle are currently eleven Main Partners, who provide special support in their respective areas: ABB, Accenture, BMW, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Interbrand, Microsoft, UBS and Xerox. In addition, there are three Main Partners exclusively supporting the \"Leaders of Tomorrow\": \"Credit Suisse\", \"Swiss Re\" and \"ZF Friedrichshafen\".\n\nThe St. Gallen Symposium has established a close cooperation and partnership with the Max Schmidheiny Foundation as well as the University of St. Gallen, which puts its infrastructure at the symposium’s disposal every year. Through the support of the St. Gallen based Ria & Arthur Dietschweiler Foundation, the St. Gallen Symposium Public Forum is enabled.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous donors, who contribute greatly to the funding.\n\n"}
